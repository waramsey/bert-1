51	1	a	Not as good as its predecessor, but still a good game. The AI is a little wonky, and if you know a few tricks it's easy to use some sneaky tactics to beat the computer, even on the hardest settings. Would definitely reccomend this game if you are just starting to play RTS games and want something a little more forgiving than Starcraft or AoE2.
3772	1	a	As always, this still is the best military simulator in the world! ArmA keeps affascinating me for its realism. I really suggest you to buy the game if you're a 'fan of war', real war. The maps are really detailed and the AI is really â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥! Actually, too much but there are mods that can help you resolve that problem. Anyway, if you buy this game, PLAY IT WITH A CLAN. Arma 3 really makes you cooperate with other people in order to survive and complete your mission. if you're a CoD fan, you rather change side or forget about ArmA. They are completely different, and ArmA itself is usually not liked by 'shoot and run' fan boys. However, ArmA's editor allows you to create your own missions in every detail. Actually, it's not too simple making them, but with some commands and other stuff you can start making some nice missions and enjoy the game with your friends. Furthermore, there are tons of forums and people that can help you improve your editing skills providing you with commands, suggestions, and scripts. ENJOY.
352	1	a	best military simulator ever
5191	0	a	arma is good ill give it that, but thats all ill give. The game is good, runs smoothly, and for the most aprt without any hiccups. There is only one thing i see wrong, Price of dlc i mean seriously 30 something dollars for a couple of helis the community can make in five minutes? they do really need to rethink this whole marketing thing, not all gamers are rich people
1490	1	a	This game has ups and downs. The up is that Arma has a huge modding database. Com is that you need a good peice of hardware to run it. Overall I recommend this game just for it's realism and simulation.
2468	1	a	Easily one of the best shooters I have ever played. More Simlator then most claiming to be out there. Nothing like a 'C.O.D' or 'BF'. Great Game Highly Recomend It.
4738	1	a	the definitive go karting experience
354	1	a	Ive had this game sitting in my library forever, i tired playing the campaign awhile back and just couldnt get into it. Well today i tried out a co op server. About 8 hours later i realized I was extremely hungry and it was nearly 3 in the morning. After 1 session of playing i had plenty of super fun moments from my very first mission where our helicopter got shot down almost instantly upon entering the AO leaving me as the lone survivor all the way up to my last mission where we had an insane firefight with overwhleming odds. What really wraps the game together though is the sound...One second you're moving towards an objective and suddenly bullets cracking overhead becomes the only thing you hear. What makes this even more tense is you might not know where you're being shot from and even once you do find the bad guys, you have to fight through the recoil of your weapon and your fatigue in hopes you can land a nice shot on them. You are not Superman in this game, you can't mow down bad guys like Call of Duty and youcan die faster than you can blink if you're not careful. Really fun game if you want to get as close to combat as you can without actually being there.
1403	1	a	If you want to drive BAD â¥â¥â¥ TANKS, JETS, OR HELICOPTERS THAT ARE ALL ARMED TO THE TEETH buy this game, if you want Fun cooperative gameplay and tactical, realistic fire fights, buy this game. The realism is insane, from actually needing a First aid kit to treat a wound, to having to find parts to repair a vehicle this game is sweet!
2703	1	a	Great game!!
649	1	a	ArmA is military simulation with military venicles,helicopters,... and weapons.ArmA III is good simulation,but body armor is garbage.In ArmA II you kill everything (without tanks,choppers,...) with one bullet.In ArmA III you kill a soldier with cca 2-5 bullets to torso,to helmed is cca 2-3 bullets and to face is cca 1-2 if you if you aim well.But in ArmA III is the greatest island of the ArmA series.Altis A.K.A Lemnos is large with much cities and villages.Stratis (i dont know how this island was called in real live) is the second island with cca 2-3 towns and 1 city called Agia Maria i think.I play this game with some addons and i can recommend addon called Speed Of Sounds.This addon adds to the game a real sounds of weapons recorded from the firing range.ArmA III includes mission editor where can you create your own mission or campaign and awesome multiplayer.The venicles is good,but in most cases the venicle is remake of the for example NATO AR-2 Darter (quadrotor) is remake for the all fractions (NATO,CSAT,AAF) without FIA.In year cca 2035 is a invasion of Hecler and Koch machineguns and grenade launchers.The joke is in the infantry weapons.I dont see any infantry weapons from Hecler and Koch without addons.Lets go to final verdict...This game is fun but the body armor must die.Venicles and technic is good,but its a remake in most cases.BiS dont exploited the potential of year 2035 and nearly vehicle according to the real originals without some features.Mission editor is good and multiplayer is awesome.You can create a mission and you can play it with friends.I give this game 8/10 or 85/100% who want this score.I hope that my review will be helpful when you buy this if you buy this :)
5089	0	a	Bad game for AMD users if you want to have 30fps compared to Intel 40fps+
1327	1	a	This game is amazing its like 6 or 7 games in one....with all the mods you can play with this game makes this game so worth the money....never have i played a rp shooter but its so epic
1040	1	a	Very fun shooter to play with friends and I also love to play altis life!
2827	1	a	Wow, where do I start with this game? There is just some much to it that its hard to narrow down the game to your basic FPS, because its   MUCH   more than that.     Basics
2763	1	a	Awesome game, sandbox, immersion and tons of excellent mods make it THE best fps, and its flexibility allow you to get you in both arcadish missions as well as some realistic mil sim missions. Flexibility of missions is so wide that in any other game we would have called it mods. But in arma, its only autodownloadable missions, no need to suscribe to gigabytes of mods to have a real variety of game types. Mods can adds some very nice units or maps if you want to go deeper.
5087	1	a	This is a realy nice game ,well made, fun, military Honestly i Think this is the best Military roleplaying game .  -The comunity is full of awensome addons , like climbing addon ,rappel addon ...... and many more  - I do recommend playing with friends for an awensome coop military experience  - Oh yhea and we also have A steam group it Nammed Shadow Company123 (a group that anyone can join and form a team with us , have fun , talk etc ) - The vehicles are are very good and easy to control  - Game Mods: thers a Big variety of mods  - Workshop mission : You can download missions made by comunity and play with friends   Conclusion : this game worths your time .
1311	1	a	Its awsome you should try it 
4939	1	a	Best mil sim so far. And besides that, you can have fun in the rpg servers.  Bad side is if you really wanna fully enjoy the game, you have to buy all the dlcs, and the latest Apex dlc is like 27 bucks.
270	1	a	this is realy a good game there are enough modde't servers to play on you will find something you like
669	1	a	Even Stephen Hawking runs better than this game.
3832	1	a	30 out of 30 fps
3512	1	a	I loved every detail&amp;feature in this game except the DLC, where you'll have to pay $15 for two helicopters and to remove a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ kind of advertisement in-game.  As I said except those â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ money farming DLC's, you'll have to play this game with mods to have fun, in my opinion. If you want realism you should get ACE, but I high recommend Exile&amp;Epoch mods as I had the most fun with these mods.  And, this game is overpriced, in my opinion.
901	1	a	GG! Good game, love it +1
456	1	a	Honestly one of the best games ive ever played between all the mods like exile and the normal game modes like king of the hill this game cannot get boring. Ive put in many hours into lots of mods and such and this is what makes the game the best, you can choose how you wanna play the game zomies or killing in a town this game has it all.
2059	1	a	Ok so I bought the game and played a bit to get the controls under my fingers. Then I descovered the Epoch mod. Then I found out that lots of players are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ on Epoch servers. Then I found a PvE Epcoh server. Then I began to understand how people rack up thousands of hours on this game: 1) it's absolutely amazing  2) it has a zombie mod that is a billion times less glitchy than Arma 2 DayZ 3) Trying to go from one city to the next without a vehicle.  Tips for Epoch: Get a DMR or sniper rifle. Regardless if you're PvP or PvE, you'll need a long range rifle and a good scope. If you don't have these, you'll get picked off by the Players and AI that do have them.  Other priority items are... Carryall packs (largest backpack) First aid kits believe it or not; smoke grenades. If you can make a friend on PvP or are assaulting an event with some random person on a PvE server, and they can't see a target that you can, toss a smoke.  I've used it lots of times and it works like a charm  Totally worth buying, 100% replayability 
4171	0	a	it no work for me
2190	1	a	Only if you have a strong cpu xd
5044	1	a	With over a thousand hours on this game, I can say that Arma III is truly amazing. The first time I started playing this game I knew right then and there that I am going to be getting my money's worth. I was impressed on what was being shown right before my eyes when I launched the boot camp campaign tutorial. It was very immersive from the start and was that way until the end of the campaign. I recently joined a military realism/simulation unit because I wanted to get more experience in the game and learn more about the infantry before I am going to enlist in the Army. Joining this unit got me into modding this game.. alot. I will tell you this now, the game is completely different when you add a few mods. I would place this game as a nine out of ten itself, but adding mods as simple as subscribing to content from steam to downloading files from a website just breaks the scale, unlike many games. This game is capable of being a very basic training simulator in the military. Overall this is my favorite game in my steam library and most definitely recommend you get this game. I just cant wait to see whats in store for this game's future DLC's and feature to the Arma Series. Hoaah Bohemia, and HOAAH AMERICA!
214	1	a	Its the best computer game in history!!! Arma 3 really sends you to war. it has a big terrains,massive multiplayer mods an thousands of addons that makes it perfect.Just mess with Arma!
276	1	a	This game is one of the best Military Simulators ever! Set in the future with the Nato Forces, CSAT Forces, AAF Forces and Guerilla Forces and with the massive community you can do amazing things with friends or on multiplayer servers! I recommend this game 10/10 Best Arma game yet.
4801	1	a	The most complex and realistic Tactical Military Shooter ... once ghost recon went down the tubes after ghost recon 1 this filled the void for me and gets allot of my attention and game time :)
3410	1	a	10/10 would sell csgo skins for this game  Side note : Npcs have aimbot on lowest difficulty (on singleplayer) , but the end result is worth it
1505	1	a	Something between Americas Army and Battlefield, this game gives me what i need regarding realism and graphic design. The performance on custom missions definitely needs improvement - sadly, nothing seems to be happening anymore. Either way, i recommend!
2765	1	a	7.5/10 Good: Huge open-world map, variety of community content, improvements from ARMA 2 Bad: Lack of official content, some promised features scrapped, short campaign with convoluted plot
2371	1	a	War Simulator, not like Call Of Duty this is not fast paced. If you get shot you die.
3571	1	a	Nothing is more fun than blowing up Persians with homodachis.
3537	1	a	After almost 1500+ hours of playing thise game I feel inclined to write a review.  I don't think I can even describe how much fun I've had playing this game, the amount of immersion, realism and tactical experience is literally of the charts. There's so much to do with this game it's as if it will never end. From Sandbox to milsim to just Co-op missions literally every part of it is a blast with friends. I've met some of my greatest friends through this and If anyone is looking for a truly social gaming experience I cannot recommend this more. It's a definite buy for anyone interested in the military and tactical genre or anything of the such.
4334	1	a	&gt;Buy game &gt;Play Altis Life RPG &gt;Buy Car &gt;Buy Gun &gt;Park at the front of the PD' &gt;Oink rapidly &gt;Get chased &gt;Pull over &gt;Get tased &gt;Picking up soap for 5-10mins  I play most the game modes, the modding on this game is great. If you have good interwebs buy this game.
2223	1	a	worth it
5258	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ arma, started off great but all these â¥â¥â¥â¥ing paid DLC's are AlDz as fawk....Legit reuined a great game...F*** U
1706	1	a	This game is really fun, and has so much mods you can play. I really reccommend this game. But there is one down part to it... IT'S ADDICTING!
5132	0	a	Terrible 2/10 such lag the lack of everything in this game gives it the 2/10 save you're 60$
3899	1	a	Welcome to the jungle...
3582	1	a	A good Military Simulation game that allows the player to experience different senarios. The game includes Multiplayer and Singleplayer, differenciating the types of experiences that you can face in the game. DIfferent gamemodes and custom servers also makes Arma 3 a fun game to play.
1259	0	a	Ok so this game... The gameplay is so-so and the graphics are ok but where this game shines is the map editor. It's very in depth and pretty darn complicated, but in a good way. It has provided me with hours of tweaking and changing maps and scenarios to fit what I want to play. However, it is not user friendly at all. It is extremely painful and takes a ton of trial and error to use. You will think up a good scenario in a few hours and get your unites placed and then spend the next 30 hours way points and triggers and scripts. It is unreal. Not to mention all the time you will spend watching youtube videos and reading guides. Even if it was easy to create games it wouldn't matter because their game hosting is absolutely broken so the only person who will see your creation is you. There is a maze of technical bullcrap just to host a game for your friends to join. As if spending 40+ hours on a single scenario to enjoy with your friends wasn't quite enough and now you gotta spend an entire work week reading forums and deciphering technical jargon just to simply host a game. How could you fail this miserably as developers? This is the foundation of multiplay FPS and you just can't do it. Fail.
1286	0	a	Do not get this game unless you have a group of friends to play it with. Seriously.  The public multiplayer servers are mostly atrocious (King of the Hill is the best you'll get, but even that blows), and MOST of them are just perpetually empty. The single player campaign is laughably bad - from terrible voice acting to bad writing to ludicrously magical super-AI that snipes you through a bush from 1,500m away ... it's just a constant exercise in frustration.  The game is horribly optimized and constantly dropping frames, seemingly irrelevant of what's actually happening on your screen.  Also worth mentioning that, unless you wanna shell out another ~$60 for the DLC, you're not going to be able to use about half of the weapons in the game, or access the superior map. The default maps, Stratis and Altis, are boring islands completely devoid of any real life, aside from a few dozen copy/pasted towns and miles and miles of blank, arid land. The DLC map, Tanoa, looks signifcantly better - but I'm not paying $30 for a good map and around a dozen weapon reskins.  Unless you're a glutton for clunky punishment, this game is not for you.

2466	1	a	 This game is simply amazing.   I know the FPS may be bad at stages and the bugs and glitches may be annoying, but hey, it's ARMA. A3 is an amazing game and even more amazing with mods. Never can I say I have seen another game where I can screech in my F-18 Super Hornet over a bunch of ISIS Militants in a fictional town in the middle east. The multiplayer is simply amazing as well however, buggy at times. I did not enjoy the gameplay very much at the start but when I added the necessary mods, it was a master piece.   9.8/10    TLDR -   PRO: Amazing game with great core gameplay  CON: Minor and Major bugs and FPS Issue Tip: Accompanied with right mods, it is a master piece
5156	0	a	It sucks it has the worst campain, it crashes all the time, the phyics suck, it has the worst A.I., and also if your playing on sever that does saves your progress then when you crash which happens all the damn time you have to â¥â¥â¥â¥ing start over
1874	1	a	Altis is love... Altis is life 1000000/10
343	0	a	WOLD BE GOOD IF I COLD â¥â¥â¥â¥ING PLAY THE â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ GAME!
1368	1	a	After recently playing a lot of Arma II, mainly on the game modes 'Island Life' and 'Wasteland' I decided that I absolutly must have this game, and when it went on sale this summer sale (2014) I snatched it up right away; and I can tell you I do not regret it a single bit!  Wasteland is a little different to what I was used to on Arma II after only playing it for a short while but fun nethertheless, Zeus is where the game has really caught my attention!  Read up on Zeus and give it a shot, you wont regret it if you want more depth to a shooter.
3247	1	a	If you're looking for a tactical and realistic approach to a shooter this is the only way to go. If you don't have the pacience to play a slower paced shooter, then you should look the other way. The community keeps the game alive and fresh, either with mods, missions, or even game types. The size of the maps is so big, you'll hardly ever repeat anything in the same place. This is a game you won't get tired of, the platform just allows for new stuff getting created everyday...  ArmA is a unique experience, nothing even compares with it. It's not perfetct, it does have its bugs and glitches, but in the end  it is worth every penny .
4647	1	a	Even though I just started playing this game, I would already say it was worth my $60. The graphics are amazing and the detail makes everything look cool af. The only cons I would say are there are so many different controls that you will be referring to the field manual very often. Also, the keybindings are very awkward. For people that play different FPS often and are used to things like ctrl or c for crouch or space to jump or e for interact, they'll be annoyed when they constantly forget it's x to crouch. I was also sort of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ that I couldn't change the keybindings...
1341	1	a	Best Army Simulation in entire time then ill play games...wery nice work :)
544	1	a	A game close to my heart. Shows the best and worst of PC gaming.
3164	1	a	Arma 3 is the new age tactical shooter with more addons to enhance your game.
3770	1	a	I wish I did not bought this game so I could buy it again - 10/10
1659	1	a	only game i will spend 66 hours a week on 
4441	1	a	I have put in a nice amount of hours into this game and it's truly beautiful, I have to say one of the best Military Simulators out there along with all the mods that spice this game up. But anyways with any game there are some bugs and glitches and Arma 3 isn't rare with those. And one last thing If you're playing with AI prepared to get rekt those â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s can see you coming from miles away and have nearly perfect aim, although there not the smartest about moving into cover when they see you, nor are they the smartes if you flank them, So yea if you're going to play against AI flank them.
4880	1	a	Arma 3 is good game, but its not like common run and shoot game like COD or BF. Since Arma 3 was made more like a simulator than a normal game, the controls is a bit spesific. You wouldnt understand it if not played it before, but you will learn it quite fast.  The graphics is great, but not the best. the details though is very well done.   The gameplay: Arma 3 is a game you will probably either love or hate. In the sigleplayer you get to do almost whatever you would like to. From diving and desarming mines to defending towns in badass helicopters. the multiplayer can also be amazing. Team up with a couple of friends and you got it! Thats some hours you will probably never regret spending.  Now, there are som bugs and all of that, but screw them! If you like detailed and huge maps Arma 3 is for you. If you like realstic shooters Arma 3 is for you. And if you love having a good time with friends driving around in various vehicles mowing down stuff, this game is deffinitly for you!
1350	1	a	The only game where I had a UN Press team try to interview me in the middle of a firefight about the war in Altis.
4759	1	a	An immersive FPS that includes realistic strategy and awesome battles with a range of weponary. Stunning visuals and gameplay 10/10 from me!
1707	1	a	This is the most amazing military simulator out there. Call of Duty players say goodbye to your MLG and try to master ARMA III and you'll find it impossible. Anyways this game has AMAZING graphics and offers SO MANY FREAKING KEY BINDING!So do I recommend this game/simulator HELL YEAH!!!
1062	1	a	ArmA 3 is Bohemia Interactive's Military Simulation game released in late 2013 and a successor to their acclaimed ArmA 2 released back in mid 2009. The reason I'm reccommending this game is because of it's playability on a grand scale. I started playing it back in early 2014 And since then, I'm still discovering new ways to play this game, and still loving the old a great ones. But I'll go through some pros and cons. So it's not totally biased.  Pros:  Grand Scale Warfare. If you're just recently coming from a game like Battlefield or CoD or any other FPS war game looking for something more big, or you're just wanting a big realistic map to drive a tank around, this is for you! ArmA 3 comes out of the box with a 270 km2 mediterrainian map named 'Altis' with everything from hills, towns, airports and military bases, based off the real island 'Lemnos' in the middle of the mediterrainian sea. It also comes with it's sister island, much smaller in size, clocking in around 20 km2 named 'Stratis'. And their buyable DLC 'Apex' which comes with their Pacific jungle terrain at about 100 km2. There is something for everyone, and the grand scale in a game with the ratio of detail is unmatched.  Realistic Bullet Physics. In A3 bullets act how they're supposed too. Trying to shoot a sniper zero'd in at 600 metres and a man 200 metres away is likely not going to hit, but go over his head. So naturally having the correct range is key. Bullets have proper peneration with a 45 .ACP round not penerating a wall decently, in comparison to a 7.62 round flying through it. The bullets follow proper drop like you'd expect, and they even have rebounding! (Oh the times I've trolled my friends firing at their feet, it rebounding and killing them...Woopsie).  Awesome vehicles. The use of Tanks and aircraft is just amazing, they have a good range of all kinds of vehicle types. From civilian trucks and offroads, to NATO tanks and a artillery truck that looks like a mobile SAM turrent. And the jets that make you â¥â¥â¥â¥ your pants when they buzz you and they're not your team.  Sandbox Style Game. This is probably the biggest part of A3, and it's the pure creativity of the community. With the use of a workshop and mod support. And the ability to simply create missions and upload them to the workshop. This game stretches out from all the things I mentioned and becomes a really good game. I believe mods help games blossom and shoudn't be used to reflect on the game in a negative way.  Cons:  Clunky. Although the game is a mil sim, the game can get really clunky. From odd movements and annoying vaulting animations, this game can get really irritating when you're running for you life with a hail mary of bullets behind you, and you're sprinting to vault over a fence, and your character lazily vaults over it, like you're taking a nice casual stroll. It can really make you want to throw your keyboard.  Bulls*** AI: The AI can be challenging and fun a lot of the time. But sometimes, they can be bloody irriating. The fact that they can work out the exact area to shoot you in the head from 300 metres after firing two rounds can really get on your nerves. And this is apparent to newer players. The learning curves on how to take AI out efficently can be annoying, but sticking with it can help, although it shouldn't really be like 'Sticking with it', the AI should just be decent ;)  Overpriced DLC. Now ultimately I can't say sh**, as I own all of them, but the DLC are way too overpriced for what they actually are. Helicopters gives you two Helis and the ability to sling load vehicles in a Huron for 12.00 USD, Marksman which I didn't mind paying as much for as it gives you seven new weapons that can be used for long range, including new scopes, better Ghillie suits and a remote laser designator. Is a little bit more bang for you buck, unlike the one I mentioned above. And Karts is kind of useless unless you feel like being a go-kart master and thank god only costs 2.00 USD. Probably the most expensive and the most debated on weither it's worth it's rather big price tag is Apex, including the Tanoa map I mentioned above, clocking in at about 35.00 USD, which is kind of horrible considering ArmA 3 itself is about 40.00 USD, five dollars above the DLC. Alright, I won't mention any more about the DLC.  Bad optimzation.  Now before people say 'Get a better PC Scrub'. I do have a fairly average PC, but I'm not getting at that. The game has been known for it's rather â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ optimization, and the fact it is 32 bit, it's not fully using the memory efficiently. The game has been known to run at like 40 frames for people with really good PC's, and although it was a huge improvement from A2, it still needs more work, hopefully they can fix this in the upcoming months.  Bugs. Need I say more? Bugs are irritating as â¥â¥â¥â¥, although not as common as back in 2014, some are still there, and can be really annoying.  Anyway, that's my summary of ArmA 3, feel free to debate any of the topics with me, I'm more than welcome. Thanks for reading this far, I appreciate it. All and all, ArmA 3 is a must have for PC gamers, due to it's massive community and it's creative elements, that truly turn this from a good game, to a great game.  cheers!

4844	1	a	10/10
4541	1	a	Over 1000 hours in arma 3 and 2000ish in arma 2, This games performance ruins all gameplay mechanics no matter how amazing they are. while somedays fps is at 40-60 others (Now) 3-15 quite frankly its pathetic, if i could refund it i would, HOWEVER lets say u have a solid 60FPS ALLL the time, then, this game is 100% â¥â¥â¥â¥ing amazing and i love it when its like that, the pure nature of the game is unlike all other militarys u will ever find and even though the performance sucks and makes this amazing game unplayable for the few times ive had where i go a full day on 60FPS they have been the best gaming days of my LIFE. In conclusion, if u can run this game at 30FPS and beyond, 100000000)% get itif you cannot, get CSGO :P
699	1	a	Arma 3 is based on real events playing in 2016 few days after UK has left the EU.
650	1	a	Game designed for hardcore players, but still really enjoyable and interesting.
3346	1	a	Arma 3 is a ridiculously complicated military simulator which includes 7 buttons just to look around (that is if you're too special to use the mouse like everyone else). You can play through a bunch of single player scenarios which subject you to taking down the odd bad guy, while knowing that a single stray bullet could end your life. These scenarios are all pretty much the same, move on to the next town, take out the five random guys that are wandering around armed with assault rifles, then repeat. It's multiplayer that makes this game shine, a bunch of modded servers like the immensely popular 'Altis Life' mode in which you can play as a civilian or cop. As a civilian you'll buy your drivers license, set off to a life of adventure, get robbed, stripped naked and kneecapped before being abandonded in the desert. In your next life you'll probably head over to the cocaine field to try and make some easy drug money, right? Wrong. As you fill your pockets with unprocessed cocaine (which look suspiciously like rotten cabbages) you'll likely run into a group of like-minded rebels who will make it their business to brutally kill you and take all of your items which you worked so hard for. Then you respawn with nothing and do it all again. As a cop you'll try to stop this from happening, but you'll probably just taze the wrong guy, run him over, then try to pretend like you never did it. You'll brutally murder a bunch of people completely on accident, that is to say, you pull a guy over for speeding, he annoys you so much that you shoot him with your tazer. Then he has a bad reaction to the tazer and the next thing you know you're cleaning up a dead body.  Honestly, do I need to say anymore?
3159	1	a	It's an awesome game!Dude, the gamemodes, oh my god.You really need to play this game, IT'S AWESOME!
4294	1	a	best game ever (y) worth money for this , i recommend to you guys buy this game :D
2876	1	a	great game
1279	1	a	i dont even have this game why am i able to write a review?
4878	1	a	Kids play COD, youth play BF, men play ArmA. 5/5 would glitch and fly to the sky and die again.
708	1	a	Best milsim game on interwebz I love playing king of the hill killing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥es in my wipeout. 11/10
1472	1	a	I have over 1500+ hours on this game...Thats all I have to say
101	1	a	I broke up with my girlfriend because of Arma.  t-thanks b-bohemia..
3381	1	a	This Game is Really Fun! Totally worth 40â¬
2374	1	a	Arma 3 is one hell of a game the shear possiblites are limitless you can kill and be killed in so many ways i give this a sure ' Thumbs Up.'
2441	1	a	If you love military simulators or just plain out love the military this game is by far the best out of any other game to play. I have played Arma 2 and OA and ever since Arma 3 came out I have not touched arma 2 or OA. This game has a learning curve but ask people in multiplayer or play the campaign for help. Overall 10/10.
4290	1	a	Very clunky game, not fully optomized yet in my opinion. Requires a very high end PC and also requires DLC to play on most servers.
2642	1	a	possibly the greatest game ever made....  
1091	1	a	Attention: I am NOT reviewing Arma 3 solo play. I am reviewing the online multiplayer in Altis Life and Asylum.. First of all, let me just say that a majority of the people I've come across in this game are complete â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s. They'll kill you, take your stuff, harrass you, etc; all while you have your back turned. HOWEVER.. the rest of the gameplay makes up for it. This is one of those games where you need friends. Don't have friends? Make some. It is so unbelieveably easy to make friends in this game and at that point you can actually have a promising team to get â¥â¥â¥â¥ done. You WILL NOT succeed on your own. Sorry, if you're a solo player, you're gunna need a team at some point. Altis Life is a game mode. It's fun, and there's no limit to what you can actually do. Be a cop - Check. Be a rebel - Check. Be a taxi driver - Check. Be a paramedic - Check.  I love this game for the time I've played and I recommend it to anyone who's willing to die over and over, to eventually succeed.
4346	1	a	Famous last words: 'Is that a grena-'
4840	1	a	10 - Graphics 9.5 - Sound 10 - Gameplay 9.7 - Voice Acting 10 - Potential (Modding, and custom mission scenarios)  Overal this is a great game! 
2886	1	a	This is so good!! So realistic omg!
841	1	a	If you loved arma 2 you'll LOVE arma 3. AWESOME GAME! Buy it!
2170	1	a	addicting for the next 500+ hours or so then it becomes boring as you will be doing the same thing again but 500+ hours of entertainment :D
3723	1	a	Arma 3 seems like a good game, unfortunately it is proving to be nearly impossible to play any missions with just two people. I have the APEX edition and I see the features like the class creator, then when I get into the game I realize that there is no way for me to actually be able to use the custom classes I create in game! Which is incredibly frustrating. 'Oh you want to play a mission that would be perfect for sniping? Well we will make sure that you can only use an assualt rifle and an ACOG in EVERY MISSION!' That is the unfortunate message that I am getting from the game. If ANYONE CAN HELP please do so. I think it could be a very enjoyable game IF it had some simple features such as the ability to actually play the way you want to play.   Thanks
4754	1	a	ARMA III  In my eyes, personally i think this is a game. Thank you for spending time for reading my review:P
1013	1	a	Great and hooking game that keeps you engaged. If you're looking for a war simulator, you've found it.
4685	0	a	Gameplay is perfect, the idea is perfect. But expect low fps ( even on high end pc's ) Some times my gpu load drops below 20% this happens on low to ultra settings. My friends have the same problem. It happens in the city;s. Not in the open. Looks like this game can't be fixed cause the problem ik the engine were the game is build on. The only fix is a entire new engine. Like they are going to do with dayz standalone. I get 75 fps average but drops which are like in the 20's  If you can live with fps drops to 25 buy it. The gameplay is the best part of arma 3. The sound is below average. Not the quality but direction of the sound is coming from
3809	1	a	Its like skyrim but in the future 10/10 -IGN
3986	1	a	I LIKE DIS GAME CUZ U CAN GO BOOM BOOM INTO BAD GUY
4627	1	a	Great and adictive game, and even more addictive when you start to install mods, A little buggy. 9/10
582	1	a	I originally bought Arma when it first came onto steam. However back then I only played 1-2 hours of it, and left it in my library to rot. It was not only until a week or two ago when I started to play it fully. I tried out most gamemodes, and I must say, it is a great game. Below is (a long) first match.  I jumped into a King of the Hill match, and it was hectic. People were shouting over coms, team and proximity chat, strategitcal locations and manuevers. The objective was 3 Km away so everyone at the base was finding transport anyway they could. I found this small helicopter almost full taking off, I hopped in and we flew away.  The pilot, attempting to avoid fire and a long flight, flew over the deep ocean. Now we weren't that far from shore, but far enought that it would be an insanely long swim. I was sitting in the middle of the helicopter looking at the pilot, as he looked back and told me it would only be a couple minutes, and that we would have to parachute. As he looked back at me, I could see through the windshield a missle coming right towards us. There was an enemy hidden on the shore with a rocket launcher. We were hit and falling at a rapid rate. The launcher hit our back tail, and we were plummiting towards the ocean. Fumbling with my keys to try to jump out, the helicopter hit the water, and sank extremely fast. I was lucky enough to eject myself, and swim towards the surface. As I swam I saw several bodies of the other passengers. I was the only survivor.   Hurt from the crash, I was unable to swim fast, and I was stuck in the middle of the ocean. The waves were big so I had to fight staying on the surface. I was about to give up hope and drown myself, as I knew I wouldn't make the swim. All of sudden I hear a helicopter! Some pilot saw the crash and saw me swimming! He lowered himself and I hopped in. Boy was I glad, I thanked him a ton, and we started to fly off as I saw the bodies of my comrades float to the surface. I was able to capture a picture of the rescue below. (I play on three monitors so excuse the extremely wide screenshot)   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=367509437   Sadly this rescue would end soon as the same rocket launcher shot us down for good. I spawned back at base and rode out on an ATV with some random teammate on the back. The drive was long, 3 Km, and towards the end, a helicopter lowered down and shot rockets at us. It had come from nowhere. As it hit us with one rocket, a friendly jet shot it down. Hurt from the rocket, my teammate and I escaped into the bushes. We were still 500 meters from the objective. Moving at an extremely slow rate because of the injuries, we ran into battle. Sadly we were both easily picked off.   My 30 minutes thus far has been a failure to go into actual battle, and I wanted to actually fight for once. I rode on a helicopter and we parachuted down, all 12 of us. People shot up as us as I saw a few friends fall, I flew into a tree and hid in some bushes. An enemy tank and some infantry walked right past me as I lay in the bushes. Once they left, I ran into a broken down house with half of it missing. I look out a window and see a dozen enemy troops parachuting down.. into the backyard. None of them saw me but I knew once I started firing, I was to be outnumbered. Desperate for some firefight, I opened fire. 1..2...3...4... they all fell as I shot them down. More men had landed but they were confused where I was firing from. I had killed 4 men at this point and killed a 5th as I looked to my left to see a sniper in the bushes. Him and I stared at each other for a few seconds, as I saw him aim down his sights, and headshot me.  Seriously 9/10 great game. Only reason not a 10 is because of some bugs and poor optimization on some servers. This game isn't for a casual person looking for some quick action, you should know what you're doing or else people will yell at you.  Too much water -IGN
3066	1	a	Stay low, go fast. Kill first, die last. One shot, one kill. No luck, all skill.
1114	1	a	As close to the real action as you can get! One of my best expeirences: I was playing KOTH (SC). My team and I were holding down a building under heavy fire. I ran out of ammo and was yelling to my teammates for any extra mags while our building was being peppered. A team mate dropped me some ammo and he said 'make em count thats all I have'. The rest of my teammates in the building were running low on ammo as well and the enemies were closing in. We called for someone to bring a hellicopter from out base to extract us and bring us back to base so we can rearm. Then some one said 'hold on guys im on my way!' After a few minutes our ammo was dangerously low and we hear our chopper coming. I saw him drop off 5 other players who immidiatly engaged the other team. 'ok go go go!' yells one of my teammates. We all ran out of the tower in a crouched sprint towards the chopper with bullets flying everywhere. I finally made my way to the helle safe as well as my other treamates. Whiule watching everyone run to the chopper i see two of my teammates get dropped. One just yelled 'dont worry about me just go!' The back of the chopper closed and we took off headed back to base to rearm. NO OTHER VIDEO GAME CAN PUT YOU UNDER THAT MUCH STRESS! And I loved every second of it! Truely the type of shooter (sorry...MILSIM) that ive always wanted! See you on the battlefield!
1781	1	a	arma 3 is very fun
2830	1	a	A great game with extendability
1101	1	a	Awesome game   Great phyics and good preformance huge multiplayer + point . Alot of awesome mods eg exile and king of the hill and armageddon i recommend this game totaly worth the money , amazing game money well spent
2835	1	a	This game is great. I come from Dayz so I love mods like exile. If anyone plays this mod or similar mods, add me and let's play.
3103	1	a	Arma 3 is essentially just a major improvement over the last, while also having different enough experiences to be worth buying as an Arma veteran. With the amount of content that is currently available in this game I can't not recommend it, and the existing content really is a lot of fun. This being said I have almost exclusively played single player and koth so I'll critique those.  Probably the best thing about this game to me is the single-player, and it's because it capitalized on the parts of Arma 2's campaign that were fun, but really short and mostly just filler garbage. All of this game's missions are short-burst, short-term little missions that revolve around an objective and have you return to the main hub once finishing, akin to scenarios in Arma 2, other than the fact that the missions are connected. This really was the best way the campaign could've been approached since this game is praised for its gameplay and doing something as nonscripted as the Arma 2 campaign just isn't interesting enough to play, and people who liked Arma 2's singleplayer rarely compliment it. Because of that, I think the singleplayer alone would be enough to buy this game if one doesn't really like Arma 2's campaign but they enjoyed the gunplay and gameplay.  Multiplayer's kinda what you'd expect from this series, with the Arma Life roleplaying still going strong and a few other really fun gameplay modes like Wasteland (sandbox Arma pvp), and I'd strongly recommend getting this game if you're a fan of sandbox or rp stuff in Garry's Mod, or Minecraft, or DayZ/Unturned (any sandbox game is comparable to this game other than the combat, which makes this an interesting multiplayer game if you're into that stuff) since they're similar. Something recently incorporated by the devs of this game is koth (King of the Hill), where you go into cities from a base and siege it with manpower. It was a really nice change in pacing for this game, since it's largely controlled by you (the pacing) and it appeals to more of the singleplayer fans that like the siege reconnaissance Arma 2 represented, as well as taking different roles at or away from the battlefield, like the snipers and field medics, as well as the breachers and pilots and all that (which are supported by a perk and character system that I thought were cool for roleplaying). It's hard to say if I'd buy this game for one gamemode, but the amount of options really gives you the liberty to choose what you enjoy the most and explore the content there.  Overall, this game has a really solid singleplayer and multiplayer compared to most as well as previous editions in Arma, and the release that is this game is justified to buy based on its content additions and a newer (and clunkier) control scheme that compliments this game better than Arma 2's did, and overall improvements to the fun of this series. I'd recommend it to you if you enjoyed sandbox/rp stuff or milsim, or if you're a fan of the series already.
4442	1	a	I know it says recommended, but if you have no patience or toleration for bugs, crashes, and a large amount of trolls and hackers don't get this game. That being said, if you are ok with dealing with a un-optimized, buggy, but AWESOME game: it is best to wait for a sale because $60 is a large amount of money. But if you are seriously considering getting the game read below.  | | | |  \ / \ / \/ \ /   Now to that you have the game start to familiarze yourself with the gameplay, but don't get too frustrated because they can be a bit wonky if you have never played a tactical shooter.  Once you do this, there are two big player bases to this game: RP (roleplayers) and MIlsimers (hardcore tactical military simulation). I am a mixture between the two but I can't say I'm more towards one or the other.  If you like the sound of doing roleplay and want to jump right in, find a good Altis life server my favortite is CGIs server.  Oh wait you don't like roleplaying but you really want to be a hardcore milsim player then my suggestion is to find an 'online military unit'. The 15th MEU is a good one as I know a few people that are members. With many of these military simulation units there are age limits, it is usually 17 but all communities are different.  I really hope this review helped some people decide if this game is right for them as there are many people that absolutly hate the game and then there are people that are completely adiccted to it and play nothing else.
1156	1	a	(Note: This review is based mostly upon the playing of 'King Of The Hill' type gamemodes within the Arma 3 game.)  So, Arma 3 ... where to start?  Well, this game isn't an arcade shooter. I'm sure plenty of other reviewers have already covered the distinction between 'BF4/CoD/Arma 3' and so I won't touch that subject other than to point you toward other reviewers. This isn't an arcade shooter. This is a military simulator. There is a bit of a difference.  You can't jump in this game. You can vault. Seriously, ever tried to jump with a full combat harness and loads of gear on? And carrying a weapon?   What you will get from this game:  Intense, team-oriented gameplay that strives to put emphasis on realism and the communication factor of warfare.  The real feeling of value for mechanized units in war, and the pride and punishment of victory or defeat. A sense of patience when engaging in a battle, such that you will never really get from another first person combat game, because sometimes you just have to out-think your enemy rather than out-gun them in Arma 3. Intense firefights and vehicular combat. Most of all, a sense of enjoyment and fun.  What you will NOT get from this game:  Jumping. Infinite sprinting and dead-aim accuracy. Single-seat tanks/armor/mechanized infantry vehicles that let you blaze through a town driving and gunning at the same time. (It takes a crew to utilize a vehicle properly in Arma 3) Over-the-top cinematic-style wholescale destruction. Quick rounds/matches that are over in 10 minutes. Easy-To-Fly Jets/Helicopters.  Should you try this game? Maybe. That depends on if you want a game that gives you instantaneous, short-lived action. If you want that, you probably shouldn't play this game. If you want a game that immerses you for hours on end and makes you forget about that pot of chili you left on the stove a few hours ago and is now ruined, leaving you to order takeout because YOU'VE GOT TO GET ACROSS THAT STREET AND GIVE MEIDCAL AID/REPAIR THAT VEHICLE before the enemy launches another RPG at your squadmates, then yes. Get this game. You'll probably love it.  Now get back into the fight.
1118	1	a	Huge maps, amazing graphics, smooth performance, great gameplay... If you're looking for a MilSim or slow paced shooter, than this is the game for you.
4254	1	a	Best millitary game sim ever!
1222	1	a	ArmA 3 is one of the best things that ever happened to me and my friends. I've given it a place in my heart and it has given me a place in it's heart.  If you want to be a serious army soldier, ArmA 3 has it for you.  If you want to play like a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, arma 3 surely has it for you. The amount of things you can do in this game is amazing, the modding community suits every need. And I think that's what makes Bohemia Interactive a very good producer. They understand they can't make the perfect game that suits everyone's needs, so that's why they make modding so easy.  Would very much recommend this game, community's nice, gameplay is nice, virtually the game is amazing if your pc can handle it. Loads of hours went into this game, and I loved every single second of it and if I were to stand in your shoes, wondering if I would buy this game after reading this, you friggin' should.
2532	1	a	This game is Mad. Best Army simulator thing ive tried 
711	1	a	800 hours, still crashing cars C:
762	1	a	This game is amazing! Definitely one of the best FPS games i've played. If you ever thought Battlefield was realistic, this game is the definition of what a realistic first person shooter should be. Apart from its low FPS count (as experienced by many players all over the world), this game stands out in every other aspect. If you're looking for a realistic military simulator with an amazing community, look no further! You've found it :D
1610	1	a	wow i bought this last week for $60 now its on sale for half that...i am done...but it's still a good game
3516	1	a	Arma never fails to impress, and Arma 3 is no exception. The game looks beautiful and I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys strategy and team work with their shooters.
2738	1	a	Best army simulator on the marketplace,idk its rly fun
3879	1	a	love this game 10/10
1319	1	a	To everyone who enjoyed playing Arma 2 then you would probably like this one. The graphics are a MAJOR upgrade form Arma 2. The only problem now is that there isn't much mods for the game. Not saying its not fun its just that there aren't many mods out for it yet because it was just released. Playing a mission or wasteland with friends is fun and the weapons are very good. The game has scuba divers which are really fun to play as the editor is just like Arma 2's and you can customize a lot. But vehicles, weapons, units, etc. are limited. A problem with this game is that if you have a bad computer or graphics card your game may be laggy and you may have to run it on low settings. I had run mine on high. I reccomend this game to anyone who loves semi realistic games and anyone who likes arma 2. I'd give it a 9/10.
4649	1	a	Really great. Mods that lack 12 years olds. 10/10
3872	1	a	+ Fantastic Graphics + Great Story + Huge Community + Lots Of Mods + Tea Bagging Simulator  + Amazing Audio + Role Playing  - 12 Year Old 'Police Officers' On Altis Life - Side Chat Spammers - â¥â¥â¥â¥ Blatt?  - Rekt  I'd give this game a solid 9/10.
5090	0	a	its okay i suppose but not worth Â£40
800	1	a	Probably the best game-wise purchase of my life.
891	1	a	good game iwth weapon resting mod. i got aids and lived to tel l this tale,
2530	1	a	nice game and hella lot of mods to p[ay there be a mod for everyone and anyone
928	1	a	I uh, I miss sunlight and civilization.  10/10, would recommend.
2543	1	a	When you buy this game you must know that you are robbing Bohemia Interactive of their Money. It should be worth more than it is priced out to be.
5141	0	a	Game is cancer, devs are cancer  Heres why it sucks: DLC  Nothing but moneyâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ dev's putting adware DLC ingame that breaks multiplayers for all those people who paid 30-60 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dollars for ads ingame, what a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing disgrace, meanwhile the game is buggy and unoptimized as â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hell. I did not drop 60 dollars for this crap.  Nothing like being in multiplayer and finding a weapons and getting 'â¥â¥â¥â¥ you buy apex'.
3395	1	a	The most realistic military experience short of being dropped into a live warzone just got more intense with the Go Kart addon.
1917	1	a	The most famous of the classic blunders, we're told, is getting involved in a land war in Asia. Arma III should be at a healthy remove then, centered as it is around the battle for a fictional Mediterranean archipelago. It certainly plays all the right cards: vaguely foreboding news montages, not-so-vague allusions to real-world conflicts, and realistic weaponry and other military miscellanea. Here is the modern shooter, dressed for success.  But what's to be said for the wisdom of appending a campaign mode to a game that has traditionally been appreciated as a multiplayer creative suite? There's a blunder for the modern era. The Arma series is known foremost as a platform: a malleable assembly of characters and military objects, and rules to govern their behavior. Modding enthusiasts leverage in-game editors and a relatively ungated code structure to produce their own playable content in lieu of formal designs, and to great effect. It was odd, then, to see some lamenting the relegation of Arma III's campaign to three downloadable post-release entries. There's a stubborn canard that asserts a video game's single-player campaign, if offered, must be its nominal flagship, even when in practice it's a secondary (or tertiary) concern for player and developer alike.   But a campaign was promised, and so a campaign must be delivered. NATO forces are in the midst of a drawdown on the island of Stratis, when the once-friendly local forces lash out in a surprise attack. A multistage affair ensues, playing out in a dull triptych: Survive. Adapt. Win. The grunt tasked with doing that surviving, adapting, and winning is one Corporal Kerry, who reacts to every order he's given with a beleaguered protest ('You want me to do what??'), which is a curious trait for a soldier with a non-zero amount of experience. You, as Kerry, take on an escalating part in an escalating war, eventually graduating from a follower role on Stratis' meager 20 square kilometers to commanding a squad on Altis and its staggering 270 square kilometers. There are a few vague allusions to an overarching plot involving a British black-ops group and some suspicious earthquakes, but neither plot point stakes much of a claim on the proceedings.  The campaign is a strange beast, torn between an earnest attempt to render the tedium and dispassionate remove that color modern warfare, and the Hollywood bombast that colors Modern Warfare a la Call of Duty. This is the sort of conflict where acronyms (NATO, FIA) fight acronyms (CSAT, AAF) over acronyms (LZs, OPs). But it's also the sort where trite wartime quotes fill the interstitial screens, and where the only attempt to characterize the enemy force is an epithet--'greenback'--that's occasionally spat. Arma III is content to let you idle while an ally goes through a lengthy, inaudible, and ultimately inconsequential discussion with a checkpoint guard, or direct you to report in to characters whose only purpose is to refer you over to talk to your commanding officer a few yards away. It restricts your character's movement speed to a controlled jog--elbows in, gun stock squarely nestled on the shoulder--and sends you humping across the hills and valleys of Altis for miles without encountering anything worth loosing a round at. Then an electric guitar wails, a bomber starts strafing your position, and you're forced to bug out at the same ponderous pace that you entered with seconds ago.  The fractured nature of Arma III's campaign makes for an uneven experience at best, but that variability does have an accentuating effect when things fall into a more natural stride. For one, there's a real fragility to Kerry and his unit. So when Bohemia dangles the carrot of an escape helicopter before you at the end of one grueling mission, and then snatches it away with an untimely bit of antiaircraft fire, Kerry's horror-struck pleas of 'no no No No NO!' take on a bitter pathos. The introduction of the island of Altis is another high point, presenting a rigorous mission that sees Kerry attempting to rearm and regroup after being stranded behind enemy lines. When Arma III isn't trying to show off a fancy new military gadget or weave in its half-baked tale of black-ops intrigue, when it's leaning on the more tangible drama of a botched rescue or frantic coms chatter, it simmers in a way most shooters can't.  It helps that your forces aren't punctuating every explosion with a string of expletives, of course. But for the better part of the campaign I supplied my own. Not two skirmishes into the Survive campaign's relatively tame first level, it seems I'd already died more times than I had in the entirety of Dark Souls, and that game's motto is 'Prepare to Die.' I'd hop off five-foot-tall ledges and crumple into a bloody heap. I'd get gunned down while looking at the full screen map, after being prompted to look at the map. I'd open up the help menu for instructions on some trial-by-fire task, and get killed while reading them. I'd succumb to razor-accurate shots fired by enemies in distant hills, enemies who never seemed to have a scope on their guns when I eventually overcame them. Some of these instances were learning experiences, and not soon repeated. Others felt like side effects of the campaign's delay and piecemeal release schedule--what Arma veteran would have welcomed a long-awaited mode that leads with a thorough introduction to controls he or she is already familiar with?  The campaign is a strange beast, torn between an earnest attempt to render the tedium and dispassionate remove that color modern warfare, and the Hollywood bombast that colors Modern Warfare a la Call of Duty.  Arma III uses the full keyboard for its array of possible actions, split between personal affairs like toggling flashlights and binoculars, and issuing orders to your squad. Much of the heavy lifting is foisted on the mousewheel, of all things, which scrolls through contextual actions for almost anything that's to be done in the game. The controls alternate between instrumental and overly finicky, but they never cease to be an aspect of Arma III that requires constant attention. The unwieldiness does lend combat a certain gravitas, however. Most modern shooters grant an athletic flourish to the act of killing; here, the satisfaction of downing an enemy comes from the knowledge that he won't be shooting at you anymore, not in how adroitly you head-shotted him.  There isn't such a positive spin to be put on Arma III's artificial intelligence, however. It's particularly damning, because the strategic underpinnings require a close coordination with squadmates that the game's engine isn't prepared to give. Teammates follow commands at their leisure, if they follow them at all. During one marathon trek across the island, I reached my destination with only two of my eight-man squad in tow. Looking back from the top of our hilltop destination, I could chart the lost squad members like dropped breadcrumbs--one trapped on a rock, four frozen solid in the middle of a field, and the last determined never to leave the two-story building he'd wandered into of his own volition. All attempts to order a regroup returned a chorus of firm but vexing 'Negative.' So much for 'no man gets left behind,' then.  Review from GameSpot  @http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/arma-3-updated-review/1900-6415721/ 
2393	1	a	Great game, great mods! 10/10
67	1	a	The best and one of the kind military simulator, with unprecedented tactical depth and wide array of additional features, like:  - Accurate ballistics &amp; penetration simulation  - Good range of vehicles to choose from  - No 'story rails' and total freedom of choice in sandbox environment  - Barely surpassed weapons/gear customization  - Greatest community out there with quality mods/addons Worth its cost on 300%
4745	1	a	I just like flying the jets in this game.  Jets are cool .
4229	1	a	really good game with tons of mods
3132	1	a	Such milsim, many games, much fun, so ARMA.
4028	1	a	Very fun, will play for years.
246	1	a	The enormity of the map is the foundation for the experiences that distinguish Bohemia Interactive's flagship franchise. It's what makes radios, topographical maps, binoculars, and compasses practical equipment in an FPS. It's what allows for kilometer-long headshots and coordinated convoy raids. It's what makes using your eyes to spot hints of enemies--muzzle flashes, tracers, gunsmoke--as valuable as being a crack shot. Arma 3 represents an aesthetic overhaul of the series. Unbelievable dynamic lighting, a volumetric cloud system, genuine vehicle physics, 3D weapon optics, ragdoll, noticeably improved weapon audio, and other grainy, eye-level details await scrutiny inside Arma 3's macro elegance. The best improvement is the merciful cutting of Arma 2's rigid, Tin-Man-without-oil combat animations, which makes infantry combat more responsive in your hands. With voice-connected friends and a good user-created mission, Arma 3 is an unparalleled war story generator. On Operation Fault Line with a gang of Steam pals, I had to drive a clumsy, eight-wheeled transport called a HEMTT across the map. To protect this elephantine truck we had a IFV-6c Panther, an APC with a mounted grenade launcher and 12.7mm MG. Minutes after leaving base, our tanky bodyguard eats a land mine, ruining its left track. As we get out to survey the damage, rockets streak across the valley. Everyone's okay, but the Panther is immobilized.
5372	0	a	This game don't deserve much love,bad performance,mouse bug at start can't click anything,controls are bit weird mostly when you try to aim it zoom...whatever,ordinary graphics (played Ultra 1080p) with 2009 polygon count.On foot graphics runs better with people shooting and all that good action than flying on helicopter that you only can see ugly ground texture with some trees with no action...weird. Grass looks to much like paper really ugly. Yeah you can make scenarios and yeah the map is huge yeah it's a sandbox but no it's not that great. To many people likes it,takes a hater,i rarely hate games but Arma 3...i hate it.
16	1	a	You can force women to mine gold 10/10 would reverse gender roles again
1644	1	a	Really good game, you just have to get use to some mechanics. Overall, i give the game a 8/10.
4836	1	a	This game is fun to play with friends or by your self. There are lots of game modes you can download and install such as: Battle Royal,Wastland,Altis Life ext. If you are bored of playing multiplayer (Dont know how you would be) you could play the campain or play some of the show cases. 10/10
2796	1	a	Arma 3 is a good military simulator although not in the real era of Arma 2 it still uses real world models to base their weapons and vehocles off. The game does have its flaws but with a bit of modding you can make it ANYTHING! Seriously you can. It's a great game which you should enjoy if you like real military themed games. Also you will need decently fast internet otherwise things can go all.... lets say.... potato. But overall this is an amazing game and very fun when playing with friends.
2199	0	a	This game isnt really worth buying unless you plan to mod it to play community content.  ( Mods, Not workshop ) If You compare this to other games bohemia has made it is a Pitiful comparison and tho this game does infact have all content from Arma 2 It is not done so by bohemia themselves. It does require moding to be able to access this games full potential. This might be seen as easy by most people. some might even think this is a good thing But i do not think this game is the way it should be.      TLDR Butt Mad because no content
2702	1	a	This game is really fun to play with friends! I enjoy all the realistic aspects of the game. It is also one of the best sandbox games I ever have played :)  10/10 would play again
4127	1	a	Continuing a fine tradition ARMA III brings realism in combat to the greatest level. Maps that are miles across with dynamic weather and day/night cycles (you can even navigate by the stars!), the best ballistics in the shooter gaming world, and every type of vehicle you can think of from tanks and helicopters to jet aircraft and small submarines, PLUS a powerful mission editor and decent AI gives you an unparalleled amount of content and replayability for your hard earned dollars!
631	1	a	I recommend this game because it is a great simulator and has some great mods like arma life and epoch. This game is as close to real life as you will get
5068	1	a	I hardly play Multiplayer, in any game, dunno why I just don't....ARMA 3 is one of the three games I player multiplayer in. Here's a story that    As part of a PMC team I deployed into a contested area to eliminate an HVT. Our chopper got shot up EXTREMELY bad, to the point where one pilot and both gunners were KIA and the remaining pilot was struggling to get it on the ground. We proceeded on foot and got savagely attacked, only after twenty minutes of trying to not die did a jet arrive and rake the area with bombs. Once the area was cleared we verified the HVT and stole a luxury car to escape.   Just...insane. The realism of ARMA 3 coupled with the fact that I was fighting alongside guys halfway across the world who were just as invested into the mission as I was made our plight that much more intense.   As a veteran of the ARMA series I can attest to the progress Bohemia has made in ARMA 3. Almost (ALMOST) everything I griped about in previous games were fixed...including some that actually made me stop playing for a while. I was a little â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ at the lack of units at first, but then I remembered the crap-ton of user-made addons avalible in the Workshop and on Armaholic. I now have units from the cold war up to the Vanilla units of the future. I can play any war that I want and I can't think of any other game that can do that.   The island of Altis is HUGE, Stratis is pretty big but meh...it's a fruit fly compared to the Budgie of Altis (look up the difference, it's a suitable comparison...don't you judge me). There's a lot of space to destroy, with a variety of different areas allowing for different combat. You can do anything from marching across a shallow river to an intense firefight in a city.   The variety of fighting is outstanding. Being able to fight as a soldier, then go to a tank commander, then a gunship pilot, and a plane pilot, then to a special operator....it's outstanding. I've played in user-made campaigns where you literally cover every aspect of the war. To sum it up, it's like starring in a dozen war movies on your own.   If you've got patience and a desire to learn you can take a spin at the mission editor. It has a STEEEEEP learning curve, it'll require some serious investment to get good at. I've been playing these games for a while now and I STILL haven't mastered the editor (I'm good but I can't do some of the insane stuff others have). This allows for almost unlimited replayability, once you're done with the vanilla campaign and whatever custom ones you downloaded, you can simply hop into the editor and make your own!   Now time for the gripes  There's some aspects of the game that are...difficult to cusp, mostly in the editor. I feel like the game is actually all that finished yet, I won't go into detail about this but there's features that don't seem all quite there yet. I also don't appreciate minor DLC's being thrown out there with only a bit of content. I liked it better when Bohemia released a DLC with an entire new army and several new maps, like Operation Arrowhead (which was actually stand-alone), British Armed Forces, PMC, and Army of the Czech Republic. I haven't sunk any money into them because I'm holding out for 'ARMA 3 Pan-Asian War' or 'ARMA 3 World War III'...or, something of that strain....something with new armies, maps, and weapons instead of just a few new features. (To specify, I'm not saying that the DLC's are bad but I'm not willing to pay for them until something monumental comes out).  All in all this is an outstanding game without peer (say all you want about CoD and Battlefield, I love both franchises and have sunk many hours into their various incarnations, but they don't hold a candle to the glory of Armed Assault). If you're a serious gamer, this is your game. Military fan? This is your game. Modding fan? This is your game. Micro-transactions to restock energy and make moves? SCREW OFF AND GO BACK TO YOUR PHONE. You're not welcome here and we'd prefer if you kept your micro-transaction covered fingers out of our bowl of Steam.   Score, for those of you who like numbers and slashes (they get  my  motor running, something about it just really gets me riled up) 9/10  PS For those of you who had ARMA 2 there's a lot of ported content on the internet. I personally have the vanilla maps from ARMA 2 and its expansion packs. It's pretty damn cool going back to Takistan and Chernarus with the updated engine!
927	1	a	Arma 3 is an amazing game, however I'd reccomend doing your research before considering purchasing it. I personally am not a massive fan of 'life' servers or that sorta thing, and I think public servers that try to be tactical are (with the exeption of a select few) mostly terrible. The base game has a decent ammount of content, but I personally can't deal with the AI and can't stand the single player. The BEST thing about Arma 3 is mods. Mods, Mods, Mods.   Mods fix many of Arma's intrinsic problems and provide you with more content than you could ever want. It turns Arma from an okay-shooter to... well, pretty much anything. Life servers, Milsim groups, more relaxed tactical groups (my preference) - Arma 3 is the BEST sandbox shooter out there and, assuming there's something you're interested in, it's definately worth the price.
5049	0	a	DON'T BUY! OPTIMIZATION IS TERRIBLE!
1211	1	a	Played many hours on this, great game and great modding support
4169	1	a	&gt;mfw i hit a small rock in a go-kart and die  11/10 GOTYAY.  But seriously, this game's a hell of a lot of fun. With friends. &lt;3
3167	1	a	Arma 3  The soldier stalks his prey, carefully aiming his rifle The prey turns around Get shot in the face Rage quit Arma 3 Break computer with sledgehammer Repeat 5 times, until you realise Arma 3 isn't Call of Duties or TF2  11,000/10 would smash again
432	1	a	AMAZING GAME, I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1225	1	a	Awesome game. Already played it for 1700+ hours, and it doesnt get boring ;). The Apex DLC is really good aswell.
3550	1	a	Best game ive ever played tbh
668	1	a	It's fine for a couple of hours.
2183	1	a	Since some of the people who read my comment didn't understand I was talking about multiplayer and not the game itself, I guess I'll go back and edit my review.  The singleplayer is awesome, that's all I can really say. Just finished it today. There are some hard parts, I died quite a bit. I really like the fact that you get to lead your own squad and posistion them wherever you want, I like games like that. However, the multiplayer server thing is still not good for me. I've tried to refrain from playing it, but one day I thought I'd give it a shot. So I was driving a tank, and we were ambushed by 2 mraps full of at soldiers. I destroyed the first mrap and I ended up getting shot by an AT soldier. The guys who were in the convoy with me ended up killing the rest and said I was terrible. I saved their asses, but no. I was the bad one in the situation. I will say, there are some really cool moments in the game, including multiplayer, which is why I will reccomend the came. Down below is my original review.      This game is fun, but once again, the community seems like a bunch of jerk wads. I got in a helicopter and decided to try and fly and I accidentally crash and then they're sitting there calling me names and stuff, then I say I'm new and they're like, 'Then don't play the game!' â¥â¥â¥â¥ the community, I'm done with this game. I was so hyped to play it, but sadly, the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ community strikes again.
2562	1	a	I have had Arma III for about a year now, and really engoy the game. The graphics, and overall gameplay is amazing and well done. I do suggest you have a higher end computer to play this game though, or play on low settings. I would suggest this game.
5142	0	a	Rubbish game With great good graphics and an exciable ending to the story where meaty m8 blaze tryes to take over europe to save his family and enilate all minoritys. all in all i rate this 8/8 m8
4007	1	a	1. Run cocaine wit ur boi's 2. Love your mother 3. Make money 4. F**K Bi**hES 5. ?????? 6. Profit
499	1	a	The only series that my mod folder is larger than the game.
3683	1	a	Nice game
1831	1	a	Drive for half an hour to get to the fighting, so you can shoot in the general direction of unseen enemies before you die.  10/10
3115	1	a	This game is the definition of greatness. The graphics and physics of the game are amazing! Though the game is not easy to get used to, this game is a must play for anyone that like brutal unforgiving combat and realistic gameplay. 
3384	1	a	The first couple days, can be really painful for most of the people, 'ArmA 3' is kinda hard to understand, it's not for everyone especially not for 'BF/COD lovers', the maps are really great, graphics are awesome same as the audio, this game is made really good, not as ArmA 2. ArmA 2 is lagging a lot, has a lot of fps drops, playing ArmA 2 on 1920x1080 Mid/Low and i have only 30-60 FPS, ArmA 3 on 1920x1080 Ultra High/High 80 FPS +++, half of ArmA 3 players can't kill a standing player, so the combat is pretty easy i'd say, the game is pretty expensive but it's definitely worth the money, 10/10.  
1347	1	a	This game is a massive improvement from Arma 2. The gunplay is significantly better, and the map is great. If you like military simulators, look no further!
4998	1	a	First of all,  THIS GAME IS AMAZING.  If you like military games, realistic stuff, vehicles, big map, pvp (There is much more). This game is for you. If your bored of doing missions, you can always go and play other gamemode like, King of the hill in which there are three teams and one town and the team who can hold off the town for the longest wins. There is altis life in which you make money by selling drugs/ mining etc. and then spend the money on stuff, you can rob people, gas stations and become a cop (RP). Its a really fun game to play.  I would rate it  9.5/10  because of some fails in the game's mechanics, its still a really fun game to play with friends or alone.
5029	1	a	Sexy ambient, also lighting.
3774	1	a	Operating operators operating operationally meets special needs children walking with their asscheeks.
3566	1	a	+1
1436	1	a	Well Im pretty new to Arma. I have all of them but never played because of the difficulty curve. I've been palying Epoch mod lately and its fun. Just unsure of what exactly to do besides see people and kill them. I know theres basebuilding and missions but I have yet to figure either of those 2 out. Its a very in-depth military simulator and should prob not be bought by COD or Battlefield players as its much different than those 2. I will spend more time playing and getting to know the game. Its pretty great so far.  A/V = 8.5 / 10 Gameplay = 9 / 10 Learning Curve = High
1676	1	a	Will be hard to get to grips with at the start, but dont let that affect you.. once you get to grips with everything, this game becomes the BOMB! I used to regret buying this game but now im addicted.   You should try out King of the Hill (SC) game mode, its really fun!   or  RPG mode ALTIS life, its a little strange at first, especially if you've never played Role Play games before. Everyone is really serious and its a bit much for newcomers but nevertheless its definitely something new!   find what you like! and ill tell you that your money is definitely not going to waste :):)  good luck!
3092	1	a	Typical Arma: Getting better all the time. Some of the mods and addons are so clever you could be forgiven for thinking it's Arma4 not 3 ... Already with steam workshop mods and addons ranging from simple missions to mind-blowing fully scripted conversions - there are always going to very large amount of mods and missions thanks to the familiar and easy to learn mission editor (easy to learn, hard to master), plus ArmaTools for free. Top quality addons from the community being added all the time- and you can use your other Arma/Arma2/OA/Iron Front/TOH content via a mod called AllInArma.  As in all the previous Arma mil-sims, eventually hardware and mid range systems are catching up to it about the same time community content gets slick and plentiful (as it is now for Arma2).   Underwhelming as a pie down the trousers on first release, but turning into an great game.
1210	1	a	Nothing Can Beat Arma !!
473	1	a	Arma 3 is the greatest game ever made.  I did a 500m crawl to an abandoned radio tower on the top of a hill overlooking a village. Once my spotter and I got there he began calling out targets as he glassed the town with his binoculars searching for our target, a war criminal wearing a black beret and aviators, known as 'The Jackal'. Once we found our mark we compared him to our notes and the descriptions matched. I noted his location and then marked a right triangle on our map, finding that I was 320m North and 340m west of his position, the hypotenuse of the triangle was 467m (our distance). Then accounting for a 160m height differential between the target and I, our actual distance was 493m. Due to a slight Northern wind of about 5kph I adjusted my shot slightly to the right, I took the shot, striking the target in the right shoulder, killing him instantly.    I had to use geometry and trig to play a video game.  I approve 100%
2078	1	a	i love this game, it adds a lot of features to the previous one (ARMA 2) and i love playing them both, would recommend anyone to get this if they liked Arma 2
1547	1	a	better then pizza crust 
4529	1	a	Eats time like the cookie monster eats cookies
3706	1	a	This game is amazing especially if you like to do some rp then just buy the game.
387	0	a	DO NOT BUY IT! the CPU and GPU issues are so bad you will get 17fps slideshow in multiplayer on LOW/MED/NORM/HIGH/VHIGH/ULTRA settings, It's a shame this game had a lot of potential, singleplayer is great but don'r expect anything more then that. It will never be optimized for high end gaming rigs. Bohemia are uselss and don't even care about the issues!
4083	1	a	2,694 Hours Played Â¯\_(ã)_/Â¯  
2522	1	a	This is one of the best simulation game out there
2721	1	a	It's good.
2992	1	a	This game is amazing, from when I got it to now, I love playing on this Lakeside server called ProRP.
3681	1	a	Gr8 2 play m8.  Buy dis ples
2283	1	a	If you are after something different from the mainstream 'CoD' style shooter and need something realistic, then this is perfect. I'm an ex British soldier and I can tell you that this is a close as it gets to reality!
2916	1	a	   Introduction  
231	0	a	Could be probably the best tactical first person shooter ever. But it won't, because developers keep on ignoring community regarding the frames per second issue. â¥â¥â¥â¥ you Bohemia and your stupid DLC's.
1630	1	a	It is a ultra realistic military shooter. It is very fun to play, especially with friends. It does require a very good pc, and some movements are a bit clunky. I rate an overall 7/10.
1447	1	a	This is the best game for anyone who likes military games but is tired of games like Call of Duty. This is my favorite game and i will keep playing it.
647	1	a	There's A â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ of Tanks,choppers,submarines,Cool realism But none of them reach the enjoyfull sport of killing them rabbits in a tank Using a thermal Cannon   13/25-12 Would Kill rabbits again
2253	1	a	You are kidding me right?   You are selling the completed version of the game that should have been released in the first place for $20 more have you idiots fallen out of your tree? It was my understanding that you sold the other version because you couldn't finish the single player campaign in time for your release date.  Things you need to address you need to work on your multiplayer experience we your customers love and support you guys cause you have a great lineage but don't â¥â¥â¥â¥ down our backs and tell us it's raining!!!  Please, move from the same gamespy technology that you have been using for over 20-years old and get something more updated also spend a little money on the community by getting us some local servers that WE YOUR CUSTOMERS CAN USE here in the states without a damn 100 plus ping!!!   Get your in game comm's together to optimize bandwidth. The sounds in ArmA 3 are still a little campy I know you don't want to have to pay for a sound engineer to actually do some sound mapping from real guns but guess what this is a real gun sort of experience so suck it up and get it done!  We are your customer not some blind village idoit you can simply pick pocket when you want more money so don't treat us like one!   Regards, Tat
2132	1	a	I Highly recomend this game to anyone and everyone it is a superb multiplayer and the life servers are funny as F***
3863	1	a	If someone asks me what is the best game I have ever played, then without contemplation, I will definitely choose ArmA3. It has the best graphic I've ever seen, it satisfies the ultra-realism I've been looking for (I thought BF series were realistic) and last but not least, it makes gamers to jump into game-making. I doubt games better than this would come out any time because I strongly insist this is the most breath taking and innovative game I've ever seen.
2986	1	a	ARMA... I play the series of ARMA / Operation Flashpoint (Cold War Assault) since ... I think more then 12 years now. Of course I had some breaks, played many many other games, but I keep coming back to it again and again.   ARMA 3 is hmm, how can I say - an uncut diamond. At the moment there is a great base for the community, as there are many bugs annoying the community. We wanted it early, we got it early, so now we have to deal with the consequences - bugs, beta stadium campaign / scenarios.   It already is a great tactical shooter just like the ancessors, I give both of my thumbs up - with one pointing at Bohemia Interactive (I adore you guys) for wanting them finish the game once.
2607	1	a	After the 523 hr I have played arma 3 I have meet new friends I have joined and made groups and had some epic battles, Its an amazing game, every thing is at it best in Arma 3, the pyhisics, combat movments, wepons and many more!  10/10
4837	1	a	10/10 Would recommend to anyone! Great game and many things to do!
179	1	a	Really nice game, this is not like Battlefield or Call of Duty, this is real war! This game has everything and its gameplay is addictive.  I recommend you to run this game on a good PC.
2724	1	a	I love this game. It might be hard to drive for more cheap computer but I had a ok time running it. There are so many different things that you can do in arma I only have a few hours but I already think I'm addicted.
1186	1	a	You can slide around on your butt. 11/10
5268	1	a	Amazing game. possibly the best game i have ever owned.
4337	1	a	Season pass = No Apex
843	1	a	I would recommend this game at full price. Totaly worth it. I barly know anything about the millitary or fps' and I picked it up really quicky. Fun to screw around on Multiplayer and other Gamemodes.
2060	1	a	Got boring after the 500 hour mark, there's like, nothing to do.
4698	1	a	I was able to pick up a snake. 10/10
3660	1	a	Even after a 1000 hours of gameplay, I am still finding, enjoying and playing new things about this game. The sheer depth of what is available within the Arma community make a good game absolutely amazing. The number of different mods, game modes and excellent additions make this a very easy game to find something you will like. Be it pure combat with tanks and helicopters, roleplaying and life servers, a military simulation community using all the varieties of radios, weapons and uniforms, DayZ spin offs which have much fewer bugs than the standalone...  The list goes on and on.   I cut my teeth on the Alpha and Beta of Arma 3, and whilst it struggled at the beginning to make things work properly, and to provide a fun experience, it has developed into a wonderful addition to my library. So much so that after a couple of years, its my most played game. There is literally something for everyone here, and it is regularly on at half price. Buy it, love it, make the most of it.
1541	1	a	loving the epoch servers... check out  doubletap.com 
2594	1	a	Hello,  Let me start this out by saying I myself have played 1,372 hours of this game from the date of this review. ArmA 3 or Armed Assault 3, is a sandbox military simulation. ArmA 3 has a variety of game-modes ranging from Invade and Annex (A more objective based team oriented game-mode) Altis Life (A game-mode that is basically, well... life, you can buy cars, houses, boats, guns, etc. You can have many jobs such as, Police Officer, Rebel, Drug Lord, or anything of your imagination really.) Wasteland (A more survival based game-mode where you can team up with friends or other players to survive, complete objectives, earn money, kills others, and buy equipment) Along with a variety of other modded gamemodes ranging from, Milsim type game-modes, to more casual game-modes. If you are into any sort of military simulation, survival, or roleplaying type games, you should definently give ArmA 3 a shot, especially with the new Steam refund policy, so you can try it for up to 2 hours and if you like it, keep it. Now, is it worth the $60 dollars? For me it is well worth your $60, as I got a lot more out of this game than any normal priced $60 game. Now for the DLC, that is totally up to you, as you can play on any server, and even ride and even sometimes pick up the DLC content, it does not separate the community at all. Though, depending on your system hardware the game may be very hard to run, though with some tweaks found in forums and videos, it can improve your framerate by a lot. To sum it up, ArmA 3 is a great game for what is it.  - TooSpooky
2498	1	a	AWESOME GAME, MORE AWESOME mods, my Fav is A3L right now i also like Battle Royale, Breaking Point, Altis Life and Epoch, would recommend buying the Game, WORTH every Cent of it.
3651	1	a	80/100 
1240	1	a	Great game
730	1	a	this â¥â¥â¥â¥ so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing good cant stop playing thank you so much people who created this i hope everyone else likes it as much as i do  
3910	1	a	First play session, join a random multiplayer server called altis life or something. get kidnapped by some form of terrorist group, they take me to an island and tell me to hide in a house, the police come and save me, they give me a car to go back to a town, have the car confiscated by the cops that helped me due to speeding, run for about an hour to the nearest town, get killed by a guy in his underwear and a fedora screaming about being mlg, leave game. 11/10 would play again!
1664	1	a	While its at times clunky controls take a short while to get used to, there is loads of fun to be had in this game.  The multiplayer is great fun and the simulation aspect of it is attractive. While it can be rather taxing on your computer, the experience is not really found anywhere else.  Regardless if you are a hardcore milsim addict, or want to goof around with tanks, there is something for most people in this game.
3490	1	a	Extremely good game! Well made and all round so much fun! from plain TDM, to Altis life, you will never get bored of this game, especially if you download all the mods for it! Endless hours of fun! Nuf' Said!
4881	0	a	The Sims of fps-me A good concept ruined by dlc that should been in the game since launch or free.
1841	1	a	10 fps out of 10, would find a job and buy new PC!
3337	1	a	Amazing game! Have so much fun playing!!
2844	1	a	Increadibly realistic the best game i have ever bourght!
1633	1	a	I've played over 900+ hours of Arma 3. Most of these hours is enjoyment of Altis Life/Arma 3 Life/Takistan Life/ect. I've also played alot of Multiplayer Military simulators too. The Arma 3 community as a whole is fun and so are the custom gamemodes. If you enjoy multiplayer FPS realism then this is the game for you.  Some issues I have with the game is basically the singeplayer as a whole. Towards the start of the campaign there are IED's planted around the map which are not visible. This part of the mission you're on your own which is already I challenge. Another Issue is that the fire can be an insta kill and is extremely glitchy near burning vehicles.  Overall I really love this game and the issues aren't too big of a deal. So worth the money.
3387	1	a	I would say that the best way to describe ArmA III would be to say that it sends you to war. Be it through having your helicopter shot down in the first five minutes of you being in the game, and ejecting just in time to avoid death, then crawling to an outpost on your broken legs, to defend it to your death, or be it in having your Humvee hit by an RPG and having your commanding officer's head shot off by a sniper. The game is what you make it, but I will say this. This is not a casual game by any means. If you are a fan of games like COD or BF you will not be happy with this game. The hyper realism makes it often incredibly challenging to survive, but I can say from experience that when you do succeed, you will be as excited as ever. I would reccomend most players to start out playing online, because that is where most of the fun is. The multiplayer modes and the variety of them make a nearly infinite replay value. The game's sandbox nature make it a blast to play with friends, though it does lose something when playing alone. I would reccomend playing with friends. I give it a 8/10.
2225	1	a	Arma 3 is another great game from Bohemia Interactive! The sequel to Arma 2, Bohemia has done a great job improving their flagship military simulator for 2013-2014. 40+ guns, vehicles and 2 more massive maps. Arma has doen a great job in the past combining military simulator with massive maps and games, and it all just comes together in arma 3. Buy this game, its worth it!
5318	1	a	Must buy. Great game, gameplay is much more fluid than Arma 2, and mods and user created content provide endless gameplay. grab some buds, make a squad, and go kick some â¥â¥â¥!
2991	1	a	excellent game, 10/10- excellent graphics and gameplay if you get this you must try altis life and king of the hill they are both excellent gamemodes and you get alot of action from them, Would recommend this game to anyone
4958	1	a	Excellant game, great graphics and physics
4212	0	a	So why is this still $59.99 USD? Stop being money hungry Bohemia Interactive please..
206	0	a	This game had a whole lot of potential based on the early screenshots, but then Bohemia squandered it when they completely changed everything about it. You can find screenshots jam packed with weapons, attachments, camos, characters, and factions that just do not exist in the game solely because Bohemia wanted to go another course halfway through development.  That might have been an accpetable option, except Bohemia didn't fully commit. Because of this, a lot of the game is just copy-pasted nonsesne. Almost all vehicles use the same HMGs, GMGs, and auto-cannons with the only difference being the hull of the vehicle. All static weapons such as the mortar, GPMG, and anti-tank/anti-air missile launcher are the same in different camos for the different factions. There's maybe a total of 15 unique weapons in the game, all of which are divided into classes and inside these classes there is no variety. An example of this is the MX and Katiba. These each have their respective variants in the CQB, regular, grenadier, and DMR roles, but each one of them is the exact same. They have the same ballistics, same damage, same recoil, same magazine capacity (even though the MX has a much longer, thicker mag than the Katiba,) and hell, even the same round!  Take a look back at ArmA II, you'll notice that each faction has their own ups and downs as far as weapons and vehicles go, but in ArmA III everything feels the exact same and in MANY cases it IS the exact same. They couldn't add a different auto-cannon for each faction, but they sure could add six different fedoras and civilian outfits for you to wear!  Another moronic decision on the part of the devs was to place the game in the future WITHOUT actually adding any futuristic content. Any and all futuristic content was scrapped early on in the development process and then they started adding things that 'look futuristic.' The Merkava replaces the M1A2 Abrams tank in the least sensible move since Jimmy Carter running for a second term, the Bradley is replaced by the Namer, another Israeli tank, and come to think of it, this entire game is a showcase for Israel. This doesn't make any sense at all in the current iteration of the game where it's spread out amongst all factions, but it made a lot of sense in the original story when Israel was annexed by CSAT and CSAT started using Israeli made weapons and vehicles to supplement their Soviet-made equipment from yester-year. This is a great example why they should've committed to the original story rather than stray away from the original path and create this jumbled mess of a game.  When you get down to the core of it all, all that matters is the gameplay. Unfortunately, that is horrendous, too. The game feels like they watched Rambo on repeat for six weeks straight because instead of combat being fast paced and short lived like it was in in ArmA II, combat is now based on who is a bigger bullet sponge. Players can routinely take six or seven shots before dying, even two shots to the head sometimes does not kill! Full auto is now glorified and not using it is almost a sin because if you don't you're going to be the one in a body-bag. Seriously, they took a simulator game and turned it into Call of Duty.   The encumberance system is another horrible mess. Seriously, your character is not fit for military shape because he can't sprint for more than 20 seconds in full combat load without needing a five minute break, and good luck hitting anything once the enemy has fired a shot in the opposite direction, because your guy is apparently in his first firefight and is already reaching for his entrenching tool to dig all the way to China and is shaking harder than Michael J. Fox with a cold.  Another noticable feature of this game is how poorly optimized it is. Seriously, even with a good gaming rig your online experience will be riddled with framerate drops and, at times, outright freeze-framing.  All in all, I would not recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the ArmA series, because what you will find is far and away from the usual experience.
4557	1	a	Man, max this game out graphically and you are in for quite the treat! This game is incredible in the short time I have played it. Did most of the tutorials and simulators and started Campaign mode. I absolutely love the realistic way of the shooter (if you can even call it that). They did plenty of research and work for this simulator and it shows.   I would recommend this over any other title in the genre any day. Looking to take a break from the run and gun? Arma is your answer.
857	1	a	It is what battlefield 3/4 should of bin.   Great game anyone who loved Bf2 should get this game
2836	1	a	great game, great single player and mp, great community and great mods.
4134	1	a	Realy awesome game you should realy buy it!
753	1	a	Love This Game
4835	1	a	Amazing military sim! Endless expansion posibilities, and already plentiful mods!
5190	0	a	This review is part of the non-owned Apex expansion. Please purchase it to read this review
3	0	a	This is a truly horrible game. I tried to play it for a couple of days then uninstalled it.
359	1	a	I have played it a while and to now i think it's a good game. It was funny in the beggining with Altis life, and now to A3L. To rate it i would give it a 8/10. ps. dont compare this with gta 5 at all. Good stuff: - Nice guns - Good graphics - Good sniping experience - Good planes - Military Tactics - Tactical Movement  Down Sides: - Can be laggy for a bad computer - 3rd Person can be abused and it's annoying - Stairs kill you - Glitching into objects and then explode :P - Bushes is filled with spike strips and explosives  Other than that its not more down sides about it. If you are thinking about buying it its a good buy.
540	1	a	If you even manage to get one kill, you will feel like the greatest soldier on the planet. That is, until the rest of the enemy army finds you and kills you from a mile away.
209	0	a	They keep releasing 15 dollar DLC while many bugs exist from Arma 2 plus more. I cannot reccomend a game that the developers don't want to optimize or bugfix.The developers need to focus on the many optimization issues in multiplayer servers(vanilla multiplayer servers have issues). The game is basically, it runs at 30 FPS on GTX 970 with and I7 processor in basically any vanilla multiplayer server. You phase through walls and your character gets stuck on EVERYTHING. I have 980 hours on ArmA 2 (was a moderator on a server). The game does some improvements over Arma 2, one being the weapon mechanics have been improved a bit. I would only recomend this game on a large sale.
2632	1	a	What a fantastic game!   The gameplay is fantastic and the variety of things to do is amazing. The graphics are stunning however it is more difficult to run at a higher FPS than other games (because there are lots of things going on at the same time). The maps are huge, especially Atlis, and there are many ways to get around.  However, the 'lagginess' depends a lot on the server you are in and your latency so it sometimes takes a while to find a good server, it is best to find one in the same country as you are.  I would totally recommend this game! 9/10
4488	1	a	Ran for barely a minute, couldn't run anymore. 10/10
2149	1	a	Best military simulation!
5404	1	a	the gud guds
2270	1	a	An amazing step up from ArmA 2 with better graphics and smoother gameplay while still retaining the core principles that make ArmA what it is. Now with the first part of the campaign released, it finally feels like the complete package with a gripping and interesting story. If you in any way enjoyed ArmA 2 then buy this because you won't be dissapointed.
2846	1	a	I absolutely LOVE arma. I am particularly a patron of Exile and TLS. It's an amazing game with something like 2 cents per hour of entertainment. Definitely recommend if you like milsim or roleplay. :D
5330	0	a	i loved the game even tho i suck at it but its not optimized i see fish swimming on land water physics floating on land and the fact i payed 250$ CAD on my headset (7.1 suround sound) and i still cant tell where ppl are shooting from or where footsteps are coming from. AND the fact i have a grphix card thats in the recrierment(cant spell) i cant these damn memory log crashes where my momory cant read the info. i think i got a good modded computer where i can play Fallout 4 in ultra setting minus motion blur but still be able to tell where a bandit is shooting from, other than that my settings are MAXED (solid 45fps) and no memory issues at all this game needs more updating i keep crashing cuz of these memory dumps that couldnt be read by my computer. it doesnt stop there it crashes in single player mode and online and the crash reports basiclly told me to update/downgrade my GPU...... OR go to another server. base line if ppl want my opinion if you got mid-line GPU its not worth the price tag these guy need to work on bug fixes big time.
2861	1	a	it is a realistic simulation game cross from military combat to roleplay enviroment interesting and you won't find another game out there like this one
3923	1	a	A very good fps/thirdperson shooter game. Perfect for RP and much more. 10/10 best you could get:D
5219	0	a	Optimize your â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game Bohemia Interactive, there is no reason I can play BF4 completely maxed at an average 80 FPS yet have issues running this game smoothly at all.
353	1	a	Been playing since the beginning of the Alpha, and this game has stayed so unique. This game is a genre on it's own, nothing else out there like it. The community surrounding this game makes it all that much better, and the modding community is so big. This game is heavily moddable, which gives the community the tools they need to create anything, there is no limits. This is also one of the more hardcore FPS games out there, it's easy to get used to, but hard to get good at, and you can't do anything without a good team. All this game requires is patience, and the ability to work with other people. In order for me to fully explain how awesome this game is, I'd be sitting here all day typing this review out.   10/10, will never quit playing.  
3149	1	a	Great Game, But I want to get it so i need it to be cheaper 
3613	1	a	So I got the Exile Mod installed and ran about 1 hour around Esseker looking for supplies. I see a guy around a hospital and he looks unarmed, just like me. I ran to him and we started talking. Soon after I was handcuffed and naked in the open. He sayed he'd comeback with something to free me. 'Well, this is all I've got' - he says. Gets executed.  11/10 would socialize in a harsh apocaliptic wasteland again
4383	1	a	Arma 3....  .....Where to start.... I dont know.... .....So i wont....
5072	1	a	this game rocket blow boom and flying or land vajhicle go EXPLODESION! fli helicopaaater and land is gud too. but but no good that muich game. fun with friend but alone is okay.
4820	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ awesome game. Get it when it goes on sale. Play it for the mods. I mainly play it for Battle Royale, an extreme survival mode.
2524	1	a	This is a great game for anyone looking to have a hardcore realistic feel. Its customization is the best I've ever seen including everything you can think about However my only complaint is it requires a lot of power to run. My laptop met all the minimum and recommended settings except for the reccommended graphics card and I thought I would be fine. But I was very wrong because when I first launched I multiplayer I got a very unplayable 5-8 fps. Now things are a little better if I join a low populated server. I usually play KOTH and nowadays I am lucky to get anywhere near 20 fps without joining a server with less than 30 people and having the settings the lowest possible. So if you have a powerful machine I would go for it. However, if you don't have that fastest PC on the block then I wouldn't be too hasty to get this without doing some research. My final rating is 8 out of 10, but in the future maybe with some optimizaton tweeks that will change.
454	1	a	This game offers the experience of realism in combat of modern war. There are several different types of game play you can do. Like all miltiplayers, this game escalates in fun with more people you cooperate with. The community overall is very friendly and willing to help you out if you are lost or stuck in a situation. The graphics can look really great if your machine can run it. It is both a first person and a third person shooter, helis, jets, to all sorts of ground vehicles are available for use. Each vehicle comes with their own challenges on operating them. I would recommend this game to those who are seeking a real time, realistic simulation of what it would be like to fight in the battlefied in modern times. Many variety of guns are available for use and the maps are gigantic so repetition of landscape is not an issue.  Personally I'm not the biggest arma 3 fan but this game is a solid 8/10 in my book.
804	1	a	i like the game and will play it more often ,., also if u hav friends that play the game its even better
4230	1	a	great game
23	1	a	Thumbs Up For Workshop!!
740	1	a	This is definitely one of the hardest games i have played, i mean, i tried the first mission +30 times on easy and never survived the first encounter with the enemy. I had to find a cheat just to get past the the first battle, but the next was just as hard. I don't think Dark Souls is this hard, and it gets worse as you progress.  One annoying thing is when your character gets fatigued from running he starts to pant harder than a vintage German porn flick, i guess NATO must have lowered the standards in 2035. He'll start panting after ~30 meter and it gets worse if you continue to run, even walking makes him sound like he a heavy smoker with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.   But don't let the single player main campaign scare you from buying the game, you can have much more fun with the editor. It takes some time to figure it out, but you can make really good missions with it.   The graphics is good, but you need a very powerful PC to play it with high settings. The FPS is showing when you do the changes so you don't have to exit the menu to test it.  A joystick is recommended for flying the planes and helicopters. The game have a good variety of weapons, equipment and vehicles.  The ballistics add a touch of realism.
3835	1	a	Arma is life
1828	1	a	Fun to play but needs RHS Escalation mods and the ARMA 2 maps along with a few other mods to really become enjoyable..   Without mods the game is decent, not as good as Arma 2.  TLDR: Worse than Arma 2 without any mods.... Better than Arma 2 with mods.
4408	1	a	sooo much fun... u have to get this. and then fact they are adding mods. OMG
2009	1	a	I suck at this game.  10/10
2068	1	a	Good game spent a lot of time playing it.
1551	1	a	Got banned from my favourite server because of accidentally using voice chat in global... &lt;3 10/10
2031	1	a	Simply the best game I ever played  
3208	1	a	Great game! Can not begin to tell you how many fun times I have had. You should get it for sure. You will get many fun memories for the price you pay.
671	1	a	So worth getting, Currently creating a mod called 'Australia Life' with the help of Tonic and Aussie.  Great game for any mode.
4345	1	a	Where to start,  Firstly, it is highly recommended you aquire a chunky PC before tempting to play this game, it has bad optimized servers and has had since release, Secondly, this game is for the quite experienced players such as myself, not boasting at all, it takes some time to get into the game and also to get use to the controls as there is ALOT of keys which are used. Finally, i highly recommed this game due to its character customization and aswell as the combat movement, its very realistic when it comes to that until you see the damaging its quite weak with the weaponary, other than that this game is very well made just needs some more tweaking to make it what it is seen to be.  Rating: 9.8/10
3952	1	a	one of the best games
1071	1	a	This game is amazing. Straight up; no ifs, ands or buts about it. It does fall short in some areas compared to previous titles, for example the vehicle selection is tiny compared to ARMA2 but this will likely change over the course of the game's life as BI is releasing new content in sections like the campaign. Then of course there are the myriad of mods to tide you over :).  If you're at all into Milsim or Hardcore FPS games you're probably going to love this. The game's biggest strength is simply that you can do almost anything you want with it. You want to drive into the target area with a sub, swim to shore and rise out of the water like a Navy S.E.A.L? You can do that. Want to fly in in an AH-6 loaded for bear? You can do that. Want to fly a jet? Drive a tank? Skydive in? Attack at night? Use a mortar? Be a sniper? Fly an attack heli? Or just go in as a rifleman? ARMA 3's got you covered. It's as advertised...the ultimate military sandbox. Probably going to be my favourite or one of my favourite games of 2013 and 2014 especially in terms of longevity.
698	1	a	Been playing this game with pirated cracked version with several people for a long time while saving money for this. My game time should be over 1000 hours since the first time I tried Arma 3. In short, this game is so amazing, even though there's bug here and there. Most of the contents are player made, so this game will be played for a long...long time I say... No regrets buying it on steam, especially on steam sale hahaha!!  TL:DR = BUY THIS GAME, SUPPORT THE DEV. ONE OF THE BEST GAME/MILITARY SIMULATION EVER...
2850	1	a	Really good game. Got over 700hrs and still not bored. Only thing is it is purely optimised and as I have a AMD processor I only get 17-20 fps
1519	1	a	This might seem incredibaly dull and difficult, but after the frst time you and group of friends get pinned down in a village while in convoy, and your friend expertly lands a Hummingbird right in the street and you all pile in while round whizz past your heads, and you soar into the air to safety, its almost indescribable (especially since the whole thing is unscripted). It can be one of the most rewarding experiences in gaming, but its what you make of it. Don't be expect to hop in and instantly enjoy yourself. The game only gives you the tools, and you make what you want with said tools.
4393	1	a	Very nice military simulator. Very realistic for people who enjoy that type of game. For fast past gamers I would no recomended this game for you as it is very a very slow.
3697	1	a	ARMA III's graphics are amazing, the community made missions are awesome, and the maps currently in the game are very pretty. There isn't much to the vanilla singleplayer, they are currently developing the campaign and have only released one 'episode' of it so far, but there are plenty of brilliant singleplayer and multiplayer missions available on the Steam Workshop. They developers have done a great job at making this as realistic and immersive as possible. Rating: 10 slithering snakes out of 10.  Update: 11/25/2016 Above and beyond what could have been expected from any developer working on a military sim like this with continued plans for future content release.
3891	1	a	Im in love with this game
528	1	a	Rate this game 20/10 i love it. i have 452 hours and it keeps going up :)   i would buy this game at any price
4592	1	a	This Game Is Very Very Awesome. 
435	1	a	it is much more fun than watching paint dry!!!
4565	1	a	Amazing army simulator that's more than just 'DayZ.' Buy this game if you want a more realistic experience than 'Call of Duty' or 'Battlefield.' 
5009	1	a	  wish i could play this game, if anyone wants to help a poor child in africa pls gift me this game
2276	1	a	Best military simulator ever. Try the survival Mod Breaking Point  www.thezombieinfection.com .
3966	1	a	Good game, played it for the free weekend. Nek minute I put my cd key in and I had to reinstall the whole game... 10/10
3432	1	a	you can shoot snakes
3274	1	a	Just buy it! No further information needed
1105	1	a	Run over a police officer for a ticket  10/10
4315	1	a	10/10
3035	1	a	-Spawn -Get in chopper -Get shot down by aimbot enemies -Repeat  10/10
2094	1	a	This game is broken in my ways , but good ways.
737	1	a	I've never tried the previous ARMA games before ARMA 3, and i've never played anything like ARMA. Its a hardcore military sim that honestly is'nt for everyone. But playing this games, there are many spectacular moments that no other game can compare. The sheer strategy and timing required in a well planned mission is intriguing. The bility to edit maps and create custom missions along with steam workshop integration makes the experience more enjoyable.
819	1	a	10 out of 10. Best of its genre. I highly recommend checking out  Gaming-Asylum.com   }&gt;&lt;{{{*&gt;
2017	1	a	Arma 3 is basically GTA 5 with a military mod.  11/10 for the GTA 5-ness.
5247	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ I still need to learn how to fly a jet :(
402	1	a	It began far away, on the battlefields of Kavala. 5 Rebal Soilders went to harness expensive and pure gold hidden for centuries. They believe their heist will ensure the crews ultimate victory, but they could of never of imagined the amount of 5 year old cops that their heist would alarm.
5248	0	a	If your looking for a Good Mil Sim game then I suggest sticking with Arma2..Arma3 has seemed to have turned into a Role Playing game much like world of warcraft...mil sim servers are few and far between altis life dayz and the other role play aspects of arma3 have destroyed what the Arma series was meant to be..but I suppose BI needs to appeal to the masses. Its a well executed game..needs some tweaking but I am sure BI will update just as they did in Arma 2..just dont expect too much in the way of mil sim for what your going to pay for arma 3. Would I recommend this game? Depends..for someone who likes to role play like dayz and life games sure..but for anyone expecting what Arma 2 was..dont bother.
4312	1	a	The best game on steam
529	1	a	The latest installment for the military simulation franchise which has been around for eons is a very nice step in the right direction in general. Arma 3 Features two new maps called Stratis (which can be compared to Utes of Arma 2) and Altis, which is a mammoth sized map that stretches roughly 27 kilometers in East to West length. The Arma series has been prone to a multitude of bugs and poor optimization, which is still evident in the latest insatllment, yet the optimization has been FAR improved in this version of Bohemia Interactive's spotlight franchise. The graphics in this game are very improved and look beautiful on Ultra settings (that is, if you can run it). This game is still prone to glitches, bugs and sudden extreme drops of framerate without warning. Some of the bugs are eveident in player movent, which has been vastly improved upon the last installment, allowing you to take on 9 tactical positions when shooting. The movement is far less clunky and works much smoother than Arma 2. Some of the movement bugs can mean that you accidentally can get stuck in a rock or wall and end up dying from being squashed. The vehicles have been greatly improved offering far more realistic physics (however the physics are not on the par of games like Forza 5) with realistic vehicle speeds. The vehicles on the other hand are painstakingly delicate and fragile than before making vehicle operating quite frustrating at times. The weapon mechanics have been totally overhauled since the previous Arma game with new damage mechanics and far more realistic recoil effects. Arma 3 also has added a new dimension to its already diverse playability, adding a more in depth (no pun intended) maritime experience. This allows you to dive to the depths of th eocean and use submarises as well. Some of the things I want to see in Arma 3 are missing such as the ability to take cover behind doors of a vehicle whilst riding in it to avoid being shot easlliy (for example, if you are driving or in the passenger seat of a car you can hold a button to allow you character to switch into 1st person view and duck behind the dashboard and door of the car). Another missing feature is the ability to shoot in vehicles with you character's weapons allowing for military simmulation dirve-bys. My final verdict of Arma 3 is a very solid 8.5 out of 10. Arma 3 offers a very vast and expansive game that has a nearly infinite replayability, yet some of its bugs and optimization hold back Bohemia Interactive's flagship series back once more. If these glitches were to be fixed Arma 3 could be a very famous game that could be a serious threat to games like the Call of Duty franchise or Battlefield franchise as well. Buying this game is a choice you will not regret and with a little time and patience, you can have a blast on this game.
971	1	a	This game goes like......  Group Leader NPC: '2 FORM ON ME' 'ENEMY UNKNOWN MAN FAR' 'HOLD FIRE' 'FIRE' 'HOLD FIRE' Me: 'MAKE UP YOUR â¥â¥â¥â¥ING MIND!' NPC LEADER: Unknown Chopper Far Me:  HOW THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ IS A CHOPPER UNKNOWN DAMNIT My Mind:  Hey im smart lets take pot shots at enemys yay *Gets out of cover for one second and gets blown away* *Starts yelling insults at the game* *Friend on Skype tells you to calm the â¥â¥â¥â¥ down* 11/10 would get shot in the face by sniper again!

4830	1	a	Eat, Breathe and â¥â¥â¥â¥ Military life. Fantastic.
3940	1	a	got spawn killed by a man with a handgun, then he hunt me down just to take my clothes and dignity.  10/10 would play again
578	1	a	If you liked to play soldier in the woods when you were a child with no friends and still has a sick perversion for it this might be a game for you, BUT WAIT IT GETS BETTER... with no enemy contact in 4 hours and when you think you have found some enemies on that one hill you see all the time, you get so â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ excited you step on a mine and then die a horrible death and you realise 'Those werent enemies on that hill it was just â¥â¥â¥â¥ing posts standing there for no reason!' , Now to the ratings!  If 'LIK OMG U CNT EVEN DO FUKN NOSCOPE 360 FROM 5 KILOMETERS? WHAT FGGOT GEJM IS TIS?' is a 10  and 'This game is a very realistic game, with realistic weapons and tanks' is a 0   I would give this game a: go â¥â¥â¥â¥ yourself im no reviewer  Would recommend to my worst enemy!
5221	0	a	It's fun when you start playing for the first 10 to 15 hours but then it gets repetitive and if you don't play with friends it gets incredibly boring and its even worst if you dont fully know what you are doing.
5392	1	a	i dont own it
4906	1	a	Great to play with friends. Awesome support from the community with mods and players alike.
2767	1	a	this game is gr8 m8 because i r8 is 8/8. King of the Hill is best tho
4714	1	a	Awsome game pritty nice grapics ran on full blast fps around 30 but will need a beafy computer to run it on full grapic but i really wish they could combine all arma 2 oa weapons and vehicles into this game and THEN it would be the best arma to me.
4893	1	a	10/10. Would walk 6km and get one-shotted again.
2932	1	a	Ugh I love ARMA 3. I can't binge any game like I can ARMA 3.
3536	1	a	Its fun so far.
2839	1	a	A really good game for people that like War mods and other things vehicles Helicopters and tanks   My Personal Favorite Mod: Overpoch  http://customcombatgaming.com/forums/index.php?/page/index.html   U can build bases on it theres lots of different guns a lot of war 10/10 mod
1856	1	a	Me: 'I have a very bad feeling about this place!'  Friend: 'It's okay just keep going straight.'  Me: 'Well you said you spotted an enemy helicopter.'  Friend: 'No it's fine just keep going!'  Me: 'Ok then!'  *Enemy soldier blasts us in our vehicle with an RPG*  Just Arma 3 problems! 10/10
763	1	a	Drove an Atv while laying down, only super elite combat units can do this. 10/10 its like skyrim but with guns. - ign
1977	1	a	By far, the best first person shooter I've played.
1731	1	a	Very fun to play with friends!
4357	1	a	Grate game for teamwork!!
978	1	a	In Zeus mode you can spawn hundreds of goats and blow them all up with artillery....  GOTY right here boys!
1229	1	a	I really like this game, it's really fun has alot of cool and fun mods you can play alone or with friend, I would recommend this game.  
2998	1	a	I bought this game the beginning of the year. And i can not put it down. this game amazes me in so many ways i can not explain. From many diffrent modes of the game to the mods. i paid the full price 59.99 and it was worth every penny!
4954	1	a	'Dude, get in the car' 'Hang on. What is that weird sound'................... 'IT'S A â¥â¥â¥â¥ING BATTLE TANK!!!! â¥â¥â¥â¥ING RUN!!!!'
5293	1	a	10/10 would shoot a police officer again
855	1	a	AI suck's but good game
896	1	a	Very enjoyable war simulator. The story is a little weak but who cares when it looks this good. The multiplayer is what it's all about really with a variety of servers and game modes. 7.5/10
4551	1	a	Good Game But Too many Glitch,Die For No Reason (5.1/10)
3773	1	a	Played a couple of hours... It was alright, I guess.
2217	1	a	The bestest shoot your friends simulator ever.
2864	1	a	Great military simulator, I'd recommend after you're used to controls to join a community. For me, the best fun you can get is playing co-op/PvP missions with friends. If you're feeling hardcore join a milsim unit, or if you want something a bit more casual join a casual community/unit. You'll meet a bunch of new people and hopefully have fun.
264	1	a	Early into the game, I noticed a few problems. The graphics are a little dated, but hold up overall. The big problem I see, is with the constant fadeout to FMV. This seems to occur so frequently throughout the Prologue, I began wondering what the point of the game actually was. I get it, that this was a tutorial phase; However, I could do with less fadeaway's and more actual gameplay. With the Con's out of the way, I like the realistic feel to the game, from the weaponry and equipment, to the military jargon, it has an air of authenticity, which makes these types of games appealing to many. Arma 3, may have it's flaws, but overall it isn't a bad game. If I were in charge, I would have modernized the graphics a bit, and put a greater emphasis on the smaller details such as battlefield damage to structures and the environment, the movement of the weeds, grass and tree's in the wind, and other little things to enhance the immersion experience. Still a recommendable game for those interested in Army Warfare Sims.
2653	1	a	It's like Arma 2 but the 3'rd one
2188	1	a	I really like the Arma 3 Game, lots of Excitement and Enjoyment.
622	1	a	did i mention its a must-buy?
334	1	a	If your computer can play it on at least normal settings with 30+ fps, must buy! 11/10.
2242	1	a	Just Epic, all i need to say. 10/10
4050	1	a	Great game, Worth every $$$  
5339	1	a	69/10
2251	1	a	If you like realistic war games, this has to be yours!!
3235	1	a	Epic Game:  -Pick heroin in heroin fields  -Get gear  -Blow up someone with a rocket launcher  -Get murdered by an attack chopper  10/10 would play again 
3554	1	a	*has $100,000,000,000,* computer* - finally, a solid 25 frames per minute.
3601	1	a	Altough it does have some frame issues at times, it's a solid title with a unique multiplayer experience. Worth a buy imo!
97	1	a	Playing a military simulation Tank flies away  10/10
2726	1	a	Really realistic War Simulator game, lots of action and no russians, Kappa. Nice graphics and gameplay.
781	1	a	Although not impressed with the 'Futuristic' setting (equipmemt wise) ARMA3 is the best choice for those who seek 'the something else'. Mainstream/arcade-ish game-modes from other games are already there for those who wany 'Something easy' while you can also achieve maximum complexity in custom missions with custom community addons. Almost ANY situation/equipment CAN BE created/recreated in ARMA verse -especially with the updated engine/functions.  Of course..it's not a secret IT IS a VERY demanding game on your hardware-but performance optimizations will be more visible by the time. Bohemia Interactive have never let their ARMA fans without support/optimizations/free content in the past. I don't have reasons to believe something will change in the wrong way in the immediate future :)
5241	0	a	You need all the DLCs or at least APEX DLC to be able to actually play arma 3 because the servers require the last DLC. You basically have to pay much more to be able to play. Hardly you'll find servers that dont require you to have APEX DLC. So instead of 35 Euros for the game, you gotta pay 60Euros. Enjoy.  by the way, they didnt fix their fps drops problems yet and they probably wont.
4668	1	a	For my opinion this is the best shooter on steam brilliant game.
4	0	a	Why did I buy this?
1739	1	a	good realistic game
509	1	a	This is a really great game, I've enjoyed the arma series and with more optimizations this game runs better and looks nice. The physics are very good and not as glitchy as arma 2 but it still needs work. They are also still adding more features to the game and adding frequent updates.
814	1	a	Arma 3- As real as it gets.
2882	1	a	  There is so much to do in this game. I highly recommend it; however, if you are new then watch tutorials on the internet or the first weeks of owning this would be frustrating.
2693	1	a	It's only in Alpha and it still walks, fly's, drive's and dive's all over all the tunnel shooters!  A real improvement over Arma 2 which i loved for all it's faults. Get it, try it now!
3150	1	a	Best military simulator you can find! 9.5 out of 10!
2751	1	a	Arma 3 is by far one of my favorite games in my libary, with 1000+hrs I have yet to get bored with the game it's self. This game provides endless mods and fun! So, what are you still reading this for. Go buy it!
4375	1	a	This game is just amazing, so much content for the price. Definitely worth the buy :P
3402	1	a	Great game overall, but very CPU intensive...
3114	1	a	Best tactical/realistic warfare game of our time. I absolutely enjoy Altis Life.
85	1	a	Kids play Call Of Duty Boys play Battlefield Men play Arma
3836	1	a	Sure, there are better plane simulators, car simulators, and other kinds of simulators, but Arma 3 is the only game that can bring all of these simulators together, and make it a full, complete, military simulator. with tons of vehicles, from civilian cars and helicopters to military tanks and jets, where even the mirrors work while you're inside of them. There are also lots of gamemodes to choose from and mods to download and play.
3789	1	a	it's a very extensive game with amazing gameplay and teamplay, however i would like to see a more AAA type game within it, like a cinematic campaign with the first mision being a stealth escape froma camp MGS style, and then as you go you unlock more equipment, guns, vests and uniforms anything really. this would be an awesome feature within this amazing original game.
1888	1	a	Great game worth every penny HIGHLY RECOMMEND
5101	0	a	ARMA III is one of those games that is really cool in it's own unique way. Unfortunately, ARMA can't stay out of it's own way long enough to remain cool. Before I start, I should mention that this review is based only on my experiences of single player and the editors with the deal-breaking focus on the editors themselves. That said, I'm expecting the dislikes to rain.  This is a difficult one to review. As of writing I've played about 40 hours of almost exclusively single player/editor use. In some ways I really enjoy this game. The biggest draw for me was the editor(s) in this game. The ability to create my own skirmishes anywhere on this giant island and watch them unfold is awesome. You can basically make up any scenario you can imagine and play it out. This alone has kept me entertained for at least 30 hours by itself. I got past the extremely unintuitive user interface and AI quirks and genuinely had a good time hiking around and blowing stuff up.  But, if ARMA is anything, it's a shining example of why documentation is so important in software development. The documentation for ARMA's editors, both 2D and 3D, is bad. And when it's not bad, it's non-existent. What does the Game Logic object actually do in the editor when it seemingly has no inputs or outputs? Why do some modules need to be synced to each other when others don't? How are you supposed to figure out what to sync to what and when?   Usually, there is no answer. Or the answer is outdated or inconsistent between the different editors. Or you'll find other people asking the same questions with the responses basically shrugging. The answers I did find always came down to a 'copy paste this script' or 'follow these exact steps' with no further explanation as to why I was doing these things. That's great for getting something working instantly, not so great for learning how to use the systems and building the intuition needed to take things further.   I don't think this is about the complexity of the editor, I think this is about bad design decisions and lack of consistent, clear documentation. I've worked with Garry's Mod coding for at least a thousand hours and have developed software for many different languages from Python to assembly. The only reason I was able to accomplish these things was from the comprehensive documentation on how things worked and _why_ they worked. And even if they didn't have those things, they at least gave a brief snippit on what is required for the function/module to actually work. Something that the ARMA amazingly doesn't have for the vast majority of it's objects. Just looking at the MP editor modules on ARMA's own wiki page, only about 3% of the listed modules have documentation. The game TIS-100 is more approachable than the depths of these editors.   So, I've had fun with ARMA for the most part. But this well is running dry for me quickly. I wish it wasn't because this feels like the kind of game I would enjoy if ARMA didn't tie its own hands behind its back. For the reasons that I bought this game, I wouldn't recommend it. If you play it for multiplayer, your experience will probably be completely different. So, take this for what it's worth.
2592	1	a	Great game to play, Strongly suggested to play with a clan for best experience
977	1	a	I have mixed opinions about AMRMA III.  The good:  Beautiful game Great squad command module Lots of weapons and vehicles The bad: GAMEPLAY So, the game is really great, but I just don't find it fun to play. It's really realistis, almost too realistic, and if the player can't succeed, what's the point? Otherwise, it's a great game
2343	1	a	This is the train simulator for all people wanting to invaid greece. It has many civilians ready for you to dominate with such force as gun, tank, plane, boat. You can steal van and drive like Niko in GTA. The bad guys in 300 deffinatly should of played this game before they tried to get sparta. The best part is the plane. So speed, such sound, wow.
2650	1	a	Arma 3... a briliant simulator! A finely made game and detail is top notch. The game is amazing to play with friends and just members of the community, good communities are rare to come across but Arma has always delivered a fun experience balancing realism with fun aswell.
873	1	a	Great shooter based in realism and skill. Extremely variable multiplayer makes this game enjoyable and exciting every time you start with new challenges and experiences to boot.  Basically it's Arma.
2429	1	a	Great game! I always loved the Arma Series it begon with OFP First Arma and the graphic's of this game are stunning! but i don't like the future vehicles ect but its awsome with mods :D
1026	1	a	Awesome and with so much content it is an amazing military simulator/ straighty game that will be forever epxanding and modding
2123	1	a	Great game especially when you find a good server with a good community, plus the mods are awesome!
4148	1	a	This game is DEFINITELY worth $50. I mean, who doesn't want to be a drug lord in Altis Life?
1032	1	a	It's good, but the AI needs working on thr AI needs to be more human
5001	1	a	One hell of a good time!
3436	1	a	Mixed emotions about this one... Bought it when it was 40 bucks, kinda wish I didn't. Only real good parts about this are customizing levels of your own. Custom KOTH servers are good too. Other than that, I didn't really enjoy this. I was hoping a lot more from Arma 3. Arma 2 still has unlimited gameplay in it. RP servers, and normal servers. If you want a good war sim, this is pretty good. If you want a semigood war sim with basically unlimited gameplay, Arma 2. I don't exactly RECOMMEND this game, but it's pretty okay.  6.4/10
946	1	a	This game needs a good pc but its worth getting one for it. Being a sandbox moddable game its less of a game and more a engine for tons of games. Once you mod it has every option to play from super realistic (as much as a game could offer) to Halo type games.
2238	1	a	Arma is how my hubby convinced me to join the PC gaming community. Couldn't say enough good about it! Can't wait to see how it evolves over the next few years. :)
4487	1	a	If you get bored of all those CoD/BF clones out there, try something 'new' and more real. In Arma 3 one bullet can be your end, at 'full health'. How it should be. It has far better emersion than any CoD, BF or CS game ever had.
3916	1	a	It's okay.  Also gave me PTSD.
4185	0	a	Well am an Arma 2 Veteran i was skeptical on getting the 3rd game of the series and man am I sad to say this game is a blow to the series while there are many new things that do look and feel rather amazing most of the content was cut out by the DEVS due to unknown reasons,lack of weapons,vehicles,maps and general content makes the game feel rushed and unfinished.  I have been there since alpha and yet not much honestly has changed I think the creators let this game slip with intention since little information is given about new content from the community managers and DEVS themselfs making this just another generic OCD/ADD combat shooter.  It may best to say wait 5 years until most of the content will be added by the fanbase and community modders . . .
2143	1	a	It is hard to make a review of this game. Realistically, every single person is going to have a unique experience and it will vary. The one thing that I can say is that performance and physics wise it is much better than any of the previous armas; however, I think that it lacks the content arma 2 had. If you have time and patience you can mod the hell out of this game to make it into what arma 2 used to be. If not, well, youre gonna be stuck with futuristic looking vehicles, guns, and awkward looking CSAT uniforms. If you dont mind the futuristic style content than it should be fine. I personally loved arma for the cold war - modern era equipment and the asthetic realism of it all which this game failed to deliver until modded. Regardless of that I still absolutely love this game and going to continue playing it for as long (at least) as it takes Gaben to release HL3
194	1	a	i dont own ARMA 3, and iv never played ARMA 3. but yet it lets me review it  trusting game
2711	1	a	This game has over a dozen different ways to crouch and lie down.
758	1	a	Buy it, learn it, enjoy it! Be sure to play WITH others as this game is not meant to be played 'solo'. Although ArmA3's single player campaign (the first two chapters) is amazing, thrilling and just plain crazy the game itself is meant to be played with others!
4671	1	a	Ooh you got DLC:s coming nice! Ooh I have to pay for those :( What OVER 10EUROS FOR â¥â¥â¥â¥ING CONTENT THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING GAME FROM THE START? Aah you got expansion coming nice... How much do we have to pay for that? Let me guess... If you own arma2 and arrowhead you will get some % off? NO CAUSE â¥â¥â¥â¥ YOU! WE DON'T GIVE A FLYING â¥â¥â¥â¥ IF YOU PLAYED ARMA2 and pre ordered ARMA3! WE ARE HERE TO MAKE MONEY AND â¥â¥â¥â¥ THE CUSTOMERS!  Still recommend this game if you like Arma at all.  Good Work Bohemia! You have become full BS â¥â¥â¥â¥ YOU   http://i.ytimg.com/vi/9jpk0_oDRhA/hqdefault.jpg 
5174	0	a	constantly crashes and lags but that may be the type of laptop I have got I do not reccomend this game!
5067	1	a	cooler than vape
1995	1	a	I'm not going to make this review long as hell like other ones. Just the aspects, the good and the bad...  The game is very realistic in the year and what they think 2037 would look like in combat. AAF are against the army, I don't know the full story but I know some of it to say what has been going on *no spoilers* Realistic in running, aiming, shooting, cover, stealth. Overall a very good game for realistic players like me and none of that COD â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t.   The bad So there are not that many bad things I gotta say. First off they need to add melee in ARMA 4 because its a pain in the â¥â¥â¥. secondly there are some minor bugs I've noticed but none to make the game unplayable. It's still very good overall. So lastly Nobody plays the game that much and if they are, it's usually ARMA 3 APEX edition, but I'm not going to spend 40$ on something that should be 20$. Multiplayer can be a hassle when getting places around the huge map.   I would suggest you buy it at the recommended sale price for 20$ or lower because I got it for that much. It is a great game overall though and I can't wait for the next one!
1751	1	a	Very Nice Map and Good new vehicle When milkman say its good its Awsome
1705	1	a	its a good fun game
3558	1	a	Great game !
2896	1	a	This is a great game to play with friends
566	1	a	Do you hate COD, are you sick of Battlefield? seeking the next level!? Arma 3 is it. I am a veteran of this game series and i can safely say that Arma 3 is the the best war game ever.   10/10  TRooper.
4690	1	a	Best from BIS 10/10, now just wait for ACE2  10/10
4532	1	a	Great Game Very Realistic And amazing
1467	1	a	Best War Simulator ever! Fans of ArmA 2, if you are fan of modern, not futuristic combat, you can still enjoy this game! With the arsenal of mods coming to it at the moment, it will soon go back from 2035 to 2014. Still, the Vanilla game is great too. The first 2 campaign episodes are great but the third one lacks of depth. I strongly recommend it to experienced ArmA fans. (Please kids, don't buy this and infect our gameplay! This game is made for mature war sim fans.)
1192	1	a	Spent way to long on this game, love it.
4257	1	a	I love this game. I transport drugs and sell this for money to buy more drugs :D
2529	1	a	Arma 3 is the best game i have purchased from steam. There is such a wide varity of things to do weather its playing through the the campaign shooting at others on King of the Hill or my personal favourite Roleplaying on AltisLife. This game may have some bugs etc but still that dosnt pit of the many laughs and great memories i have had during my gameplay. During my time on Altis life i have met a great community of people who welcome all. Arma 3 is a great game and if you are negotiating weather to buy it or not i would defonitly say Purchase this game 10/10
1827	1	a	I found a gun on the ground like my second PvE game, I picked it up and I've been using it ever since. I salute the fallen soldier who bestowed upon me this gift.
1046	1	a	Arma 3 is PC's best military simulator FPS today. There are more than enough weapons, vehicles, and equipment to keep you busy for atleast 100 hours (not including the community workshop). The community is what makes this game so great. The community workshop offers players a whole new look at Arma 3 (weapons, vehicles, equipment, maps, scenarios). There is no doubt that Arma 3 is going to be around for a long time. If you love military simulators, this game is for you. 500 hours well spent.
5362	0	a	n3xt g3n, load into a server nek m1nn1t crash
3735	1	a	Honestly, the only problems with this game is that the game is horribly optimized and has very little content in the base game, don't get me wrong, there's lots of stuff to do and this game is the definition of replayability but there's simply not that many vehicles and you'll find yourself using the same guns over and over again. However you can always mod the game but for someone who don't wan't to do that, well then, you're out of luck, there's just not much to play with in the base. I personaly mod the game so I don't have this problem but I didn't before and to honest, the base version is very 'meh'. But all in all, this game is as solid as any and for a cheaper price than COD or BF you are going to have a lot more fun, even without mods.
1648	1	a	The best god damn military simulator out there. There is nothing like it.
2612	1	a	Its â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dope, if you have a community like me to play with!
4564	1	a	It's pretty good â¥â¥â¥â¥ when you have mods.
3212	1	a	It's a great game with friends in wasteland Altis life and king of the hill
265	0	a	&gt;Be me &gt;Get banned on Day Z Standalone for no reason &gt;Arma 3 bans me without even loading up the game &gt;tells me b/c I got banned on Day Z, I now get banned on Arma 3 &gt;Curled up in fetal position and cried &gt;I want my 60 bucks back &gt;Cries
884	1	a	Forget CoD, forget BF or any other pseudo military FPS. This is game is the real deal. I can not express how much fun and how into this game I can get. Every aspect of it is amazing; on ground, flying a jet or operating a tank. This is as close as you can get to the real thing. Graphically (and audio) beautiful and divine, realistic in every aspect. What more could you want? You can't, because this game is it. The thing I love about Arma (and always have) is that, it's the game you make it and want it to be. You want a non-broken DayZ? Breakingpoint. You want sector control? King of the hill. You want a death match? Wasteland. Team co-op? Invade and Annex. I could go on. If you enjoy games where you actually have to work, think, become involved and immersed then Arma3 should already be on your steam list.
2216	1	a	yknow, good devs, good community (find yourself a milsim one), infite replayability.
3486	1	a	One of the greatest games I have ever played. Visuals are stunning, realism is incredible, comuunity is mature and respectful, lots of different firearms and vehicles to drive and shoot. Wasteland is probably the most addictive and likeable game mode I have ever played. This game is sole reason why I bought my PC in the first place. Get this game if you dont have it yet you wont be disapointed
14	1	a	Still better than  Age of Empires 2 .  Strike one for imperialism.  Looks nice, sounds nice, cannons are a great feature, has a working online service, trading cards, steam hours counting, *breathes*, all the DLC you might have missed in the old days, great 3-tiered base campaign which follows a families lineage.   Takes place in the times of exploration, which is a nice departure from ancient times.  The simplification of some game features were hit or miss, some were niceties, others just are too simple. An example of one that was a miss was the removal of individual farm squares, and collection buildings, although it can be assumed that it is automated, it still seems too simple.  Has a nice variety of units, although, the crossbowmen seem kind of weaksauce when I got Janissaries with guns and cannons so big they can be used for artillery. Its let hack and slash, blow for blow of some other strategy games, and more so the style of 'you mess up, you just might die'.  Price is a little on the high side however, and if you can get it cheaper than $40, I would whole heartidly recommend it.
713	1	a	Gr8 game. Don't actually own the game but I can review it.
3517	1	a	It's good, but not for it's 50 bucjk price tag
1627	1	a	One of the best games I have ever played. The realism is outstanding.
2746	1	a	10/10
4899	1	a	Oh Arma....what do I say about you? You have given me some of the most satisfying video gaming of my life. Theres nothing quite like being dropped into a hot AO with tracers lighting up the sky as you dive out of the chopper and run like your â¥â¥â¥ is on fire to the first available cover. After ten minutes of trading fire with an enemy squad 700 meters away, you run up on some poor  CSAT ba$tard ten feet away and you both frantically try to switch from semi- to full auto fire and take each other down. After 30-40 minutes of tense, frantic combat with your squadmates who actually want to win and survive and not just be â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, the enemy town is clear, and you pop some cool colored smoke and have a dance party while waiting for the exfil chopper. Halfway to the next area of operations, an enemy jet screams by and blows out your helicopter's main drive rotor. As you and ten other of your fellow soldiers plummet towards the ground in a flaming mess, the pilot screams out over voice chat: 'I'M SORRY BOYS, I LOVE ALL OF YOUUUUUU!'  Boom.  Dead.  I love this game. It has a steep-a$$ learning curve but you will feel like a hard, tough, deadly warrior when you figure it out.  10/10  EDIT: 64bit is a game changer
1857	1	a	&gt;Got into a gang on an Altis Life server &gt;Had war against bigger gang &gt;Won war against bigger gang &gt;Got banned because an Admin hated me  10/10
3454	1	a	Really amazing :P
3542	1	a	Do you want to blast peoples skulls off from 2000 meters out?  Arma's got you covered.   Do you want to fall from the sky after the helicopter you were being towed by was hit by an air to air missile?  Arma's got you covered.  Have you ever dreampt about creating your own terrorist cell?  Arma's got you covered.  You will not get bored playing this game. You name it, there is workshop content that will cover your needs. Not to mention the thousands of mods that can be installed to customize your experience.   10/10 would jihad again  
3246	1	a	Buy this game! Download sandbox map! Play with friends! Accidentally kill everyone!
3297	1	a	So I have played many hours and 'I like it a lot': So have you: Ever wanted to run around while looking at your feet making it look like your sucking your own â¥â¥â¥â¥? Brake dance? Shoot a guy in the knee and laugh at him because he can't run anymore? Run in to battle in your undies? (Note: thereâs a bug that doesn't allow you to go naked) Do a back flip in a chopper? Get into a tank LAV and go down the highway at 100km/h then hit a rock and go flying. And a lot more! Who said this was a war simulator you can play this game your whole life and not need to shoot one bullet? Remember Men Play ARMA! BTW: Lots of people won't like this game because they don't know what to play on it. find what modes you like or make your own!
5074	1	a	Arma 3 is amazing! It has so many things for so many different people, its not just a milsim game its a role-playing game or a strategy game it is anything you wan't it to be. There is Altis Life or Life mod servers which are just RP and there is Milsim untis which are for the people who enjoy the military side of the game. It isnt just a shooter, its whatever you wan't it to be.
324	1	a	Some Epic mods on this game. Breaking Point, Wasteland and King of The Hill being my favourites. Worth buying for any of those mods on thier own!
3790	1	a	est game ever I recomend geting while its on sale :D
1457	1	a	very chill war simulation
4960	1	a	if you seek a big community this game is not for you. 6000+ Servers with about 500 players online a day, scattered around. Give or take 50 to 100 people. So you have 5000+ Dead servers up with 0 players. Game probably use to be active, now the community is dead.  I would not recommend this game if you seek company. If you like playing by yourself, i recommend this game.
3289	1	a	Awesome cooperative game!
21	1	a	Age of Empires III is criticized for being not a good follow-up to AoE II. I don't fully understand the criticism. I prefer the colonial-era setting of AoE III much more than the medieval one of II. The skirmish mode of AoE III results in roughly 45-75 minute games, which is great for short bursts of gaming. It's a great way to unwind and is an engaging game that has stood the test of time.
2735	1	a	One of the BEST shooting games there is on the market!
3798	1	a	If it's military realism you're looking for, look no further. With a modding scene that adds everything from Star Wars and Mechs, to the entire US Army vehicle and weapons sets, ARMA 3 is an absolute playground for those wanting to experience everything and anything to do with weapons, military vehicles and more.  If you can imagine it, there's a strong chance you can do it in ARMA 3. Constant updates increase the value and rich experience of the game, and new DLC bring further incredible assets to play around with. Highly recommended!
1154	1	a	A really nice game. If you want to play a realistic tactic shooter, Arma 3 is the way to go. The best thing about Arma 3 is creating your mission and almost create any sore of gamemode to be played by yourself or with someone else of maybe even a server. One of the best gamemodes everyone shuold try if you get the game is Atlis Life which is a roleplay gamemode. I played over 1000 hours plus of it and that show how much i love this game, most of the time i would be playing with my mates or people i meet in game. I would recommend to play this game with at least one friend!
3424	1	a	If you ever want to know what war is, this game and the people in it will do it for you. Foxtrot Alpha/10
4816	1	a	1. Play Arma 2. Pick a gamemode 3. SHOOT THEM â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ES! 10/10 IGN would rate again
3129	1	a	Looks great for an alpha build. Lots of community content in the workshop. And the first Dlc/mission due soon. Great graphics etc (if your pc can handle it). 9/10
1069	1	a	Arma III is a gorgeous, detailed military simulation that in it's own way makes you feel like a warrior.  8/10
4932	1	a	good game but my pc is â¥â¥â¥â¥ :/
274	1	a	Fantastic game that still required a little rounding around the edges. One of, if not the best gaming communities who I hope will remain healthy and keep providing solid material.
62	1	a	Recommending this game is a no-brainer. If you are even marginally into shooters with a nag for realism Arma 3 is inevitable. The game won't let you in easily; it has a steep learning curve, and starting out can be quite frustrating. Also, you are less likely to find good public servers; it hardly is hop-on and play like CoD or Battlefield.   The best way to experience it is in a clan or community group. Groups range from run-and-gun type gameplay up to strictly milsim stuff, so there should be something for everybody.  Bottom line, go get it. It's unique, in every aspect.
694	1	a	27fps nvidia gtx970 would buy if i wasnt poor
2274	1	a	A good soldier is fast, accurate and effective in dealing with his weapons - all weapons in Arma 3 have realistic ballistics and handling. Adjust your weapon to compensate for the bullet drop, go into a squat or on the floor to reduce the recoil, and fire at short intervals in order to reduce scattering of ammunition. If you do not observe these points, your opponent has easier time to gain the upper hand.  With 270 km Â², the island Altis is the real star in Arma 3 From large-scale cities over rolling hills to wind and solar farms - regardless of whether the layers flattened rolls with your tank in the south or cause an asymmetric war of the hills in the north, the landscape of Altis offers extremely detailed locations with numerous combat options.  One of the best military simulators at the time, along with the stunning new engine, and the variety of mods a good game.  79/100
3764	1	a	A great millitary sim. It really demands the use of team work and strategy
1515	1	a	Best game I ever bought 10/10 love it :)
2134	1	a	Its alright
3858	1	a	THIS GAME IS FUN , BUT MOSTLEY FOR THE MODS AND OTHER MULTIPLAYER
2237	1	a	One of the best game sive played this year, would definetly recommend if you dont mind the occasional bugged death.
4561	1	a	TL;DR Score: 9.0/10  Quick Review: Just from playing a few game modes (it has many), the games are endless. good with friends, good anticheat, i personly play Altis Life gamemode alot, since its basicy a better gmod in terms of graphics. Controls are still a bit like you want to scream at your guy, however it does still get tweaked here and there, with updates still rolling last i saw. Tons of replayability.  Pros: Â» Tons of diversifying gamemodes. Â» Ok-ish graphics Â» Good anti-cheat Â» Some major communities you can get involved in.  Cons: Â» Feels like my character is unable to follow simple 'turn the â¥â¥â¥â¥ around' orders sometimes. Â» not much major difference compared to Arma 2 in graphics, but i might be wrong (been a while)  Main Review: Again, as with Arma 2 review, iv not played much besides king of the hill and Altis Life (which i love), but the game has improved alot, has a â¥â¥â¥â¥ton of gamemodes all varying from each other alot, and a massive amount of items in the game. (weapons, gear, armour, clothing, etc), hell iv not even scratched the surface of what to expierience in the game yet, nor have i done the basic operations on single player. xD  Any Updated Review:
2936	1	a	I like this game, and it's ragdoll physics are A1, 10/10 would buy again.
1094	1	a	I Got arma 3 on sale with the dlcs and crap, loaded up the game and selected Koth (king of the hill) i played for a while and really enjoyed myself a bit later in the game i got a sniper, a ghille i was set for some sniping! went to a very popular sniper location on tanou where this log, i came to figure out could glitch you into the ground if you put your bipod on it.  I abused this alot -(sorry)  i got killed by some guy named Dan who sneaked up behind me, and watched him pick up my rifle so i knew he was going to snipe aswell so, i went back to the log and did the bipod glitch and fired 2 shots into the air so Dan, will comeback. He ended up coming back! and he brought is freind who which, i went into direct communitation and started to make wierd sounds ie -(snorting, yelling, schreeching) and he and his freind 1)shot the ground 2)threw grenades at me 3) told me to get out. i didnt, and while they where trying to kill me 2 other snipers came along and found these guys shooting at the ground, to which they murderd both Dan and his freind right about now i had fallen over laughing and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ myself, while the two snipers tea-baged Dan's dead body (rip Dan) so after there tea-baging they wanted to snipe now, these snipers didnt know about this 'glitch' and had layed to the left and right of me so, i started to make wierd noises again scaring the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of them, and while they layed there they started to try to use the bipod and got the same glitch i was in, and they soon realized that i was lying beside them so, they started to shoot the ground throw grenades and blah blah blah well, other snipers from MY team found them, and killed one of them, and the other sniper 360 noscoped one of them (no lie it was amazing) and while they where distracted i poped up out of the ground and shot 7 rounds of 9mm into his chest to which he shot me in the face with a .307. i then fellback and started to laugh very loudly and started to cry from laughing so hard and my window was open so the whole neighborhood heard me, snorting, yelling , laughing and schreehing at 1am. Arma3 best game 10/10
348	1	a	They Spelt Army wrong. Thats ok though.
3176	1	a	Mods and more mods. THis game is just fantasic.
2555	1	a	Its hard on noobs. It was for me. But as soon as i found out the basics i had so much fun!
149	1	a	Great game let me get to some negatives... -Expensive DLC (Buy on specials) -Game doesn't come with lots of content(Arma 2 came with a lot of content) -Expect a lot of downloading(mainly mods and mission files) Positive -LOTS OF MODS TOO DOWNLOAD -again LOTS OF MODs to download
1880	1	a	*Loaded into RolePlay server*  -Me &amp; friend decide to get a car and kidnap someone -Tell someone to get in while we lock it -Drive him out of the city -He calls the cops - Cops stop us  -The guy who we kidnapped jacks out car  10/10 would get car stolen again :)  *But for real, this game is great and i recommend it for anyone , Sadly it requires a decent pc to run on low graphics *                                         . Why you here? Scroll down
792	1	a	:)
1456	1	a	This is by far my favorite game. Once you get out of the altis life and dayz player bases you will find alot of communities dedicated to playing tacticaly. Then there are the mods. You have addons that add maps, weapons, vehicles, and even full conversion mods like AGM and ACE3 that change the whole game and add affects like wind, and advanced medical systems. In short if you are looking to play a realistic military shooter with people who are serious about playing Tacticaly then arma 3 is the game for you.
1721	1	a	If I had to chose only one game to play and get rid of the rest. I'd pick Arma 3.
554	1	a	Endless fun with a huge variety of community made maps.. when and if you get sick of the content provided.
2730	1	a	The Most Realistic Military Simulator EVER. Nice Optimisation (much better than Arma 2). Also good graphics and gameplay. The Flying Experience goes from a 4/10 to a 8.5/10, IF you map a joystick to the contols. Though the Game might be a bit pricey, but for 50% off is definitely WORTH IT.  
2191	1	a	Nominated for the test of time award. Great game honestly.
218	0	a	I just cannot grasp how this game is so popular. I think I am likely missing the aspect of having a large and dedicated team to play it with? I have read that makes it more fun but I am just not much of a pvp person, I have always enjoyed co-op pve and this game does not seem to have enough of that. I was excited when I read about the new Zeus mode and this is what I exclusively tested with my family but it was very limited. Perhaps someday a game like this will enrich us few who enjoy co-op pve play.
2142	1	a	In all honesty, Arma is extremely fun with a group of people even if it's just with one person.  The franchise is a heavy military simulation, so if you're coming off from Counter Strike or Call of Duty, STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME.  Teamwork and communication is key to this game. It's got a great community of people, an abundance of groups you can join and play with, and an abundance of player made missions. The Vanilla game is pretty dull, but it's got a TON of mods you can download to enhance your experience. Mods that make the game more immersive and realistic than most games of this genre. Either play with a group of friends or find yourself a community to play with. My personal favorites are BROMA and Murshun. If you're looking to purchase this, I extremely recommend waiting for a sale. If you can get the Apex and the Base game for a good price, DO IT! 
4640	1	a	 I can't tell you how good this game is. Insanely good. And then times that by the biggest number you can imagine. There, I  can  tell you how good this game is.   Lets lay down the basics:  Kids Play CoD, 'hard lads' play Battlefield Real men play ARMA 3.   The mods are extremely extensive. Heard of DayZ? There are no longer DayZ mods due to obvious reasons, but Epoch and Overpoch are pretty much the same as it. Like the Hunger Games series? try Battle Royale. Like massive open-world money-based (ingame of course) team deathmatches? A3Wasteland is your mod. And then there are the singleplayer mods. Iron Front, the WW2 squad based one (which I believe is multiplayer too), Dynamic Universal War Simulator, a massive war of which you are pretty much a field generalblowing up those damn OPFOR kiddos. These are only a few examples of what are to come if you just buy this game.  And could I forget the voice commands? GlovePIE or VAC, whatever your thing is you can just shout into your mic THREE, SUPPRESSING FIRE or TEAM RED, GET IN THAT TANK and they will and you will feel good about yourself.   That's just the mods, nevermind the in depth campaign, which is very extensive or the multiplayer vanilla gamemodes, the DLCs, such as Kart mode and many more that you can just find out for yourself.
452	1	a	It's Arma 10/10
4044	1	a	I've played it every once in a while. Would recommend
5064	1	a	Amazing game Love it so much :3
1567	1	a	Arma 3 is a well developed, well made game. It has great graphics with ultra realistic mechanics but this game can be extremely difficult to get used to. If you put a lot of time into improving your abillity at the game it will pay off. Although it has its flaws. This is a good realistic combat game.
1015	1	a	Arma 3: Graphics are Better then Arma 2 graphics and look very nice, Sounds are Great and Music is Nice when their is music. I do &amp; don't recommend the game, It's Fun to run around in a cool open world game. But the AI on a lot of Server's are way to Hard to Injoy the game most of the time. The game is great if you have some friend's to hang and chill with you so the game can be a little bit more easyer as long as they are with you. Now down to business Arma 3 is a 7 out of 10
1621	1	a	1000+ Hours and i'm still playing Altis Life/ King of the Hill mods.  Do you like roleplay? Buy it.  Do you like TDM? Buy it.  Do you like tactical games? Buy it.  Well Buy it.
2776	1	a	Can anyone tell me how to sort this out please it everytime i go to play a game i have 16gb of ram and a 2tb hardrive it says 'The instruction at 0x01630984 referenced memory at 0x00000088. the memory could not be writen i cant play the game at al its a great game just dont understand why it does this only started last week :(
4672	1	a	The Best Mil Sim I ever played. I just finished campaign, it's amazing, immersive and not too long or too short. There are also a lot of good mods and the multiplayer is amazing.  10/10 :D

3139	1	a	Great game, fun to play with friends, campaign is alright, many great game modes to play on and many great mods to choose from. Rate: 8/10
4948	1	a	You don't have it already? Just get it. It's the best thing on Steam, hands down.
48	1	a	Pros : This is absolutely a fun strategy time-sink. Many hours haven't even been logged on Steam for my current account due to owning two accounts with AoE3 on it. Since good RTS seem limited to Starcraft and Warcraft, I like more realism and history than a fantasy universe. The art and graphics (if that is your main focus) are beautiful. Units work create formations which I have always enjoyed in a RTS. Gathering materials is pretty basic, wood, gold, food, and balancing everything is not too stressful which is great for any strategy game. I also enjoy the way the different difficulties are set. Easy being easy enough to learn and still win and Normal seeming challenging. There is a sandbox mode which is great for people learning the game as well and dont wish to focus on combat.  For single player, Age of Empires 3 has a genius combination of history, customization, and RTS. I make myself sick of this game and even if I stop for a few months I WILL be back.  Cons (without bias) : Let me start with the warning alert. Over and over you will hear this as long as you are being attacked and not watching that area. It causes me to mute my game when there are multiple battles. Not fun. It seem frusturating laggy during combat and this is because of units being in formation. Getting used to a combination of different unit speeds makes you break up your selection. Being that realistic is not fun to a lot of people. Single player doesn't hold your hand during the 'tutorial' portion. They expect you to know a bit about RTS already. The ships are terrible in huge groups which they make up for in speed. This is for both you and the enemy so it may seem that they pop up on you very quickly.
3853	1	a	ARMA. The most respected Mil-Sim series to date. Serious play, that's the objective.  'Fun' isn't a word I would use. It's not casual, you simply can't hop in, play 15 minutes, and then hop out. The enjoyment comes from finding a server and getting to know people. Playing with them when you take on hour long missions, that's the enjoyment.  First thing I have to say really, which I almost forgot about, IT'S REAL SCALE. The 'maps' really should be called environments. You can't drive from one side of the island to another in minutes. The battlefield is really a battlefield. While most modern games focus on a small segment of a city, town or something, ARMA is about the openess making you sniper bait. You have to look hard for hostiles, they could be shooting at you from a hill across the valley.  Performance. Was it terrible the first few days after release. Even still, AI seem to cause a drop in FPS even though they are far away. This isn't latency, this is pure frame for frame output. Never really understood how something unoptimized got pushed out. That being said, they follow Valve's ideas and push out updates for free.  I play with a GTX 560Ti and Core i7 870. CPU matters, GPU matters. i3 wasn't up for the task, even with a 4GHz clock. You need an i7 or 8-core AMD heat monster to play with details. If you can push your rig, you get to see things that many don't get to see.  N00bs will have a large hill to climb in regards to learning the game.  7/10
107	1	a	  This was my Christmas gift from my best friend on steam, And we had both hell of alot of fun at it. Made new friends while playing it, and learned alot more about Military tactics and procedures.   Pros: Full real sized open world map of a real greek island. Ultra Realistic combat Always something for every Military junkie like myself. Challenging yet well laid out singleplayer campaign. Use of any kind of vehicle available rangung from Quads to Jets. Use of any role that fits you.  Fun multiplayer modes, Co-Op or PvP  Active modding community.   Cons:  You need a beast â¥â¥â¥ PC to get the full expierience and a stable internet connection.  Hard to see the enemy, but the same goes for real life.  YOU WILL DIE If you are not carefull and use tactics against your enemy, If they have the upperhand on you, you won't live to tell the tale.    Overall despite that you need a beast pc to play, And some friends to get the real fun out of it. It's totally still a must have for any tactical military milsim players!  10/10 - 'Would play again' 
3530	1	a	11/10
4986	1	a	A very good game. Admittedly I haven't played it very much since Counter Strike took me and didn't let go. However, if you are looking for a good military simulator game with a intresting campaign and fantastic multiplayer, this is it. Play PlayerUnknowns battle royale, it is a classic and where I have spent ~75% of my play time.
2567	1	a	Best damn game out there. Just get it. Now.
516	1	a	this game gives you a dnokey boner when you attack dose dam greeks
2671	1	a	This is the most realistic Modern military game to date. the game is abit expencive at the moment, but what ever right? Arma 3 has Awesome graphic, kinda buggy at times, but it's constantly being updated. There are alot of diffrent types of servers, RPlife types, Realistic military, inde. type of military operations, wastland i.e survival w/ a group of friends or a team of random, and it's all %100 free roam. The singleplayer isnt perfect, but it's OK, although, it keeps reseting my progress, so I didnt try to complete it, But it's one of the best games I've ever played, it if you think it's boring, play with some friends, it is WAY better with friends.    P.S dont buy the DLC, not worth the money, just play on modded servers, or get mods
1239	1	a	As the 3rd installment to the Arma series the quality that this game brings to the table is unpresidented in any other Arma game. With the RV4 it adds in DirectX 11 to bring stunning new visuals never seen before in the franchise. The clunky mechanics from Arma 2 have been reworked and are now fluid as ever in Arma 3. Although the game was rough at launch with performance the series of patches have vastly improved performance and by far is the smoothest Arma to date! Multiplayer is better than ever with the new vehicles new guns! Overall i'd recommend this product to anyone who likes realistic shooters!
1305	1	a	Excellent game - with many, many options.
1073	1	a	Must BUY this game.
4181	0	a	Sorry but this game doesen't seem to be too friendly to new players. I just can't seem to get in to it. And i've tried it all including the milsim servers. I just don't understand the appeal. Most servers are very boring, OR way too intense, for a new player to feel comfortable. The mechanics are wonderful. But Arma seems like a very closed community. And that's ok. More power to ya, I know where I'm not welcome. I'll go play something else. Just wish I could get my $15 back. But hey, I tried. It's a beautiful game by the way, some of the best graphics I've ever seen.
4891	0	a	dlc that should be free or 1/5 the price, I used to love this game but the price of dlc and the size of what you get, back to the drawing board you ruin this game by taking to long to release new content and over charge for it, I'll buy another 4 pack of terraria at least their content updates are free and don't get kicked from every second match because you refuse to pay for over priced extra content
2705	1	a	*WARNING* Before even considering this game, ensure you have a powerful pc. I can barely run 40 fps on medium with an i7 4770, 16gb ram and an oc HD7950.   Simple review:  Pros: -Environment is amazing -Gameplay is extremely realistic (expect one shot kills from an AR)  -Srategy must be utilised to gain results -The addition of the workshop is what really makes it shine (mods, scenarios, weapon addons and much more!)  -Interesting missions, gamemodes and campaign is decent -The difficulty of the game makes it highly rewarding (subjective)  -Mechanics is great, from the physics to the UI -A ton of vehicles to learn to use, if you run out just go to the workshop -DEFINITELY NOT a fast pace game like COD or BF (subjective)  -I can be here all day listing out the pros as there are so many features   Cons: -Takes a while to get into, especially if you haven't played previous Arma games -Frustration and rage is common (especially on hard missions) (subjective)  -UI can be a bit complicated at first and takes getting used to -Large game, especially with addons (shouldn't be much of a problem)  -Gameplay takes a long time to adapt to and learning to fly planes and helis well takes ages  Proper review: This game is probably one of the best military game I have ever played. It is far different to your average fps and aims for realism. This means it is not suitable for everyone, especially those who love fast paced gameplay and do not want to patiently learn how to play.   It surpasses its predecessor, Arma 2, in almost every way. There are significantly LESS BUGS and mechanics, UI, AIs, movement and vehicle control is improved. The misfortunes of getting killed in doors from arma 2 are gone and so are many other issues.  The gameplay is extremely slow and maps are simply massive. The one thing that I find annoying is dying to a sniper after running 2km on foot in a mission. I guess it adds to the realism and when playing singleplayer there is a 4x time lapse button.  Strategising is key and it makes this game even better when playing with friends. You must learn the best ways to clear out buildings, find the best angles of attack and you must learn to work as a unit. If your ever going to use those high school geography skills, its going to be when you are using the map is this game when finding grid positions, finding hills and valleys using contour lines and using the compass.   Weapons and their mechanics are well done. Running makes your gun unstable and requires time for you to steady it when you rest. Guns have extremely high recoil which renders automatic fire almost useless, unless you in extreme CQB. Also, weapons are loud and the loudness depends on the weapon and if it has a silencer or not. Loudness translates to detection which the game implements perfectly, gunshot loudness will disappate the further away you are from the shot which makes it realistic. AIs also detect you at different rates which depends partially on how far you fire your gun from them.   Vehicles are a major aspect of the game and each type of vehicles needs to be learnt how to be used effectively. Land vehicles are quite simple and there should be no trouble for anyone there, but air vehicles is where it gets more ticky. They take time to master and must patiently be done. Vehicles range dynamically, from suvs with 50cal mounted MGs and tanks to civilian hatch backs and trucks.   Lastly, the implementation of the workshop was genius, as it made modding extremely easy with a launcher that is simple when disabling and enabling mods without deleting/unsubscribing to them. There are mods which surpass all expectations such as the OPTRE halo mod which adds a ton of content and a weapon pack (I forgot the name) which adds like fifty weapons. The user made scenario missions are very fun to play with friends and difficulty ranges along with the themes of these missions. The mods are essentially unofficial DLCs because of the quality and quantity of thr content they add.  Verdict: All in all, I recommend this game to someone who wants to try something new/different and wants to learn how to utilise new mechanics and play with friends. Arma 3 offers many things that are not present in many games.  9/10 definitely worth the price tag

Gun sway is obnoxious, optical glare is like looking through an instagram beer glass and although in real life soldiers can carry up to 40kg in a firefight, the characters lose stamina and said gun sway worsens to musket-levels of pinpoint accuracy. Not to mention there is actually no stamina bar or notification, you simply hear him moan incessently.   The game is expensive and some of the vehicles and equipment in the game is classed as separate DLC's which you need to buy to pilot or use. Despite the hefty price of Arma 3, you can expect the ratio price of the DLC's to be roughly 20 percent of Arma 3's original cost. The helicopter DLC, for instance, contains only two helicopters and a 'realism' mode which worsens your ability to fly for your viewing pleasure. They, the creators of a military simulator, also randomly brought in a DLC that lets you race around in a go-kart. No, I don't know why either.   You can indeed exchange attachments on weapons except bipods and front-grips - no one really knows why they discriminated. Not to mention said bipods serve absolutely no purpose and without a mod you cannot deploy your weapon on any environment be it bipod, edge of a window or bonnet of a car.  The body armour does indeed seem to affect your lethality but again there is no indication anywhere what is more armoured and what is less armoured., what weighs more, what weighs less.  Many of the 'futuristic' weapons on Arma 3 are actually cancelled weapons systems deemed inferior in real life (AH-99 Blackfoot) or don't actually exist (such as T-100 Varsuk) making the game incredibly peculiar.  It's also extremely difficult to host a server for your friends to play and will require third-party software such as a server host plus hamachi or equivelant software. The experience is stunningly frustrating and can easily consume three hours of your time learning the game's scripting language simply to run the game or create a respawn point. Queue irritating slurring youtube tutorials by semi-conscious d1ckh3ads who can't get to the fuc king point.  Buildings are only superficially destructible, they won't crumble but they will undergo scripted morphing turning magically into ruins.Tanks can also be defeated by a farmer's three foot stonewall. Yes. And collisions cause the game physics to dart you away hundreds of metres even in a tank sometimes.  Overrall I would rate this game as being lower than the temperature of outer space. Arma 2 including its DLC'S have major flaws but the replayability is immense and covers actual modern weapons. And whilst Arma 3 experienced the longest most buggy alpha-staging in Earth's entire gaming history, Bohemia's employees were arrested for espionage because they thought it would be smart to send two work employees on tourist visas for a little bromance 'coincidently' where they were basing Altis on and started taking pictures of actual military bases there. What the fu ck were they thinking?  Ridiculous, ludicrous. Don't buy this game. The Iranian soldiers also look like bugmen or bumble-bees.
5122	0	a	WHERE ARE THE JETS. I BOUGHT THIS SOLEY FOR THE JETS
2365	1	a	I would highly recommend this game. It's fun and i've already put some hours on the board in a short period of time.
2028	1	a	-Joins Dayz server -Spawn -Dies -Respawns -Finds Axe -Dies Again -Leaves to find new Dayz server -Finds new server -Spawns -Finds a gun on every â¥â¥â¥â¥ing doorstep -Kills other player -Gets shot at once more -Runs into the forest -Dies of hunger in the forest  10/10
2122	1	a	Bought this game last year for $60. I have played for arround 750hours. 60 divided by 750 = 0.08 $0.08 per hour of gameplay... BEST MONEY I HAVE EVER SPENT!
1969	1	a	Fun game, You can play for hours and the thrill remains, Besure to have good CPU, RAM, and Gpu
1008	1	a	What can I say other than this game is amazing and one of the best games I've ever had the privilege to play. There are like 20+ different game modes you can play ranging from straight up Round based PVP combat to survival modes and even Role-Play modes. Not only that but there are tons of mods available for the game as well that will add on dozens of hours of playability. I recommend downloading some of the DayZ mods and Battle Royal to start they are amazing!  10/10 Very realistic military simulator with lots of replayability.
4413	1	a	Was driving around with a friend in a car. Drove off a small hill, and proceded to stop moving. Asked why we had stopped moving. Friend answered: 'We appear to have lost a tire'  Walked 5km to the next objective.  10/10 would lose tire and walk to objective again.
1176	1	a	Absolutely fookin fantastic 10/10 like lads
4108	1	a	Yet another great game by Bohemia Interactive Studios. Keep up the good work!
2375	1	a	was alright, played very smoothly and looked amazing but when it came to flying/ learning to operate drones it was very confusing and not very well though out, also the online servers didn't work that well was ether glitchy or wouldn't work, or just won't load. if your looking for a multiplayer this would be good if it worked right for single player if you like cod you might like this.
1628	1	a	Overall a well rounded, well put together game with a vast community. Whether its role-play, Co-op, PvP, or PVE the community has made and played them all. The game is constantly evolving and constantlly being tweaked and fixed. The progression on the game from alpha to the latest version is by far some of the best work and dedication I have ever seen out of any dev teams, even that of some triple-A titles. If you're looking for a serious gamestyle there are many different realizm groups around to show you the ropes. If your more of a relaxed weekend warrior, the winners of the Make Arma Not War competion for multiplayer missions, Kink Of The Hill has what your blood thirsty hands are looking for. From survival to out right blowing â¥â¥â¥â¥ up this is what your looking for!
3948	1	a	The Bad Default campaign   The Good Pretty much everything else  If you aren't going to play multiplayer then don't bother with this game.
697	1	a	It's alright
4261	1	a	promise not doing this for achievement.
4990	0	a	I've gotten this game out of spite from many youtube videos and mods. I've paid money so you can save yours. This is why ArmA 3, Armed Assault 3/Armed Assault III isn't so great.  BattlEye: *shiver* don't even get me started on this false positive piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ lol.  Optimization: Warframe = Max settings, runtime tesselation on my AMD Athlon II X3 455 and Radeon HD 7770 Factory OC 60 - 75 fps ArmA 3 = Lowest settings possible same specs as above 13-*20-30* depending on map, level and the server  * mostly Also, graphics don't affect â¥â¥â¥â¥ if you don't have a 'perfect build'  Gameplay: Could fix a few things like standing up when crawling over rocks. Overall, not too shabby.  Mods: Prepare your HDD/SSD space gentlemen. Half the 'realism' or 'USA/RU' content is 500 - 3000 MB Oh yeah, remember optimization? You'll love it with mod optimization too.  Community: Everyone plays Altis Life or Island Life or basically RP those who don't play it play insurgency/ctf stuff but there's a small percent who play 'realism' squads. I've attempted this, good guys, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ experience. CHATLOG: Kawurftha: mfw playing realism with this group I recently joined Kawurftha: &gt;i die Kawurftha: &gt;they don't let me respawn Kawurftha: &gt;i've been waiting for 1 1/2 hours Kawurftha: &gt;they are finally almost done Holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥ 'Because you don't respawn in real life' Oh â¥â¥â¥â¥ I'm sorry I didn't realize banding all your wounds no matter what and injecting morphine instantly cures everything in real life? *cringe*  Graphics: Could be improved, pretty good overall but see optimization.  Overall: 4.5/10 Now I hear you ArmA people saying 'WOAH WOAH WOAH SUM1'S ANGRY THE CAN'T RUN ARMA!!! SO THEY GIVE BAD REVIEW!!!!' No, Your just too â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ to realize that BIS isn't gonna fix optimization Not just that, but 66.49 CAD? FOR A FULL GAME IN 2015? THIS ISN'T THE 1950s. Warframe is free and it runs better than this â¥â¥â¥â¥ and I can max it. 'b00t teh warframe is missions not open wurld' I mean Warframe has a pretty big â¥â¥â¥â¥ing view distance (I so think) Warframe would probably still run better than ArmA if it was open world.      I'm still gonna play this game every now and then though.
2761	1	a	Very nice game i like it! 
105	1	a	Still haven't beaten the campaign.
2033	1	a	Awesome graphics and gameplay while in multiplayer, but the learning curve is off the hook.
2658	1	a	Great game with a good story. Big community support means there are a lot of mods out there to use and get even more hours out of the game 10/10
1939	1	a	The game is a lot of fun, it improves on a lot of aspects of Arma 2 while adding more features. The only downsides I've found, are the anticheat system (same crappy one that Arma 2 had), FPS drops are awful (even with a fairly beefy PC), physics are a bit odd from time to time, and the setting being a near future one, which I'm not a huge fan of. Mods, however, could be a great solution to the last 2 negative points.
4045	1	a	Arma 3 is a game, with simulation elements. It's not a simulator.   It is also a game for a specific type of gamer that prefers large scale warfare, instead of playing casual fast-paced shooters like COD or BF. If you enjoy the experience from briefing and planning , and executing a plan , no matter how it plays out, the game adapts to any playing style that fits your style. Run &amp; gun still works, but you need to have some uber micro skills..   If your mission fails, Arma allows you to retreat and get out alive, or gives you the oppertunity to get it done in another way. That's a nice touch compared to games that usually let the game end right after a fail. (SP)  A bullet in the head will kill you, a bullet in your ballistic helmet might save your life, get shot in your legs and you're have to crawl your way out of there..   Things you have to consider in real life come close to the decisions you have to make in this game.   Playing multiplayer with a group of people make the experience even better, but this game isn't really 'finished'. While the tags say it's a full release, Bohemia keeps working for years on these games to improve and add more content. They've done the same thing to their previous titles.   If you really care about Multiplayer, I suggest Arma 2 :CO.    Pro/cons :  + Mission Editor Large scale warfare Mods (Armaholic &amp; Bis forums) Steam workshop - User Generated 'Mission' Content (Mods in future?) All kinds of vehicles (Air, Cars, Armor, Support, and so on) +270 km2 map to explore  - Multiplayer performance still crap. AIR vehicle (MH-/AH-) lost turnspeed, please add a slider to have us configurate our own speed on pedals. Setting sensitivity to high, still have slow pedal movement &gt;_&lt; Those small choppers are able to quickly rotate , but now it's a slow , long and horrible turn. No co-op in Campaign?. (Co-op game plox!) AI moves unnatural (They behave like androids)
132	1	a	ArmA 3 is certainly a great military-sandbox game. It's a hard and true-to-life experience, unless you just want to â¥â¥â¥â¥ around in the sandbox area with either AI or human players. It still feels like a beta product, though.   PROS
4319	1	a	I had Arma 3 for ages before i got into it and discovered a gamemode i liked and i could have easily wrote a really bad review about it because i just found it confusing and didn`t know what to actually do. One day I decided to research the game a bit and once you find some gamemodes and servers you enjoy this game is amazing. The trick is deciding what to do with it because Arma has no pre defined style, it has so many gamemodes. Once you find something you enjoy it is one of the best games out there. Graphically it is a masterpiece and it runs like a dream on a half decent build but it is probably too intesive for lower end systems. I strongly suggest you do your research to ensure you can run Arma before you buy it. There is a huge and active community on this game and there so many different ways to have fun. You can even basically turn it into a flight simulator if you want to. My favorite gamemodes have been TDM and Altis Life but i know there are hundreds of other gamemodes to try and you are basically buying loads of games if you buy Arma. The maps are detailed and varied and most imporantly for certain gamemodes, large! Just to top it off there are even more downloadable ones. The game is well optimised and i originally came here from DayZ as Bohemia have never disappointed me yet. I 100% recommend this game to anyone looking for an amazing shooter that fills the hole left by shooters like CoD and Battlefield that have sadly gone south in my opinion. This game is fun to play alone but even better with friends. Well worth the money and definitely deserves a place in your steam library!
2781	1	a	8/10 for being a one of a kind game. It is a massive scale, realistic military game with a developer that generally listens to its community and embraces mods. Also, Tanoa is flippin awesome.  -1 for the action menu not being replaced  -1 for no ability to play as female player model in vanilla game. It's 2035 Bohemia!
3739	1	a	Do you like dying a lot?   Arma 3!   Do you like military stuff?   Arma 3!   Do you like to slaughter rabbits?   Arma 3!  Do you like to pilot planes?   Arma 3!   Do you like to watch the sunset?   Arma 3!   You don't like doing any of this? Buy Arma 3 anyway cause it's one of the best sandbox game out there!

1987	1	a	I threw a cabbage at a cat and it ate me. -30/carrots
4591	1	a	It's one of the best FPS/Simulation games out there to enjoy non realisticly or realisticly however you want to play it. Really fun without friends to easily meet and make friends online but if you play this game with friends mod-wise or vanilla, you will have a blast I can guarantee.  The most fun I had was the cooperation servers on Linux server betas where we all worked together to destroy the enemy and unlike any other game the AI is pretty smart to notice you're not a friendly. So it is challenging to fight against them and its fun new experiences all the time, that's just the vanilla out of one gamemode. There is plenty to try and I really do suggest this game if you love working in a clan or solo against the enemy.
2582	1	a	Good game Nice to kill all the time
5235	0	a	Its a simulation, but the AI is trash, so that leaves you playing with other players. Unfortunately, people as a group are absurdly uncoordinated, the only exception to this is when they have leadership. My generation, the one after me, and apparently the one before me (if voice-chat is any indicator) are the COD generations, This means they do not respond to authority or leadership well. For the groups of friends who join a server, squad up and play like a team, I truly commend you. To the brainless swarms who waste days upon days of time accruing fake money on wasteland servers venturing out into competetive servers only to hop into and immediately crash the helicopter... **** you. If youre lucky enough to have a group of 20 or so friends to play a game of ZEUS with, the game can really shine, failing that.... Just download a wasteland mod and pretend to be a lone wolf internet badass, because thats the future of this game.
306	1	a	A game that has so much variety and so much fun packed into it, if you like some medium/slow realistic firefights with vehicles and choppers flying around this is the game for you. make shure you have the pc that can handle it before you buy it, takes a pritty good cpu
3184	1	a	Big fan of arma! buy the apex version, its cheaper and everyone uses DLC so might as well
498	1	a	Stay low, Move fast. Kill first, Die last. One shot, One kill. No luck, ALL SKILL.
1344	1	a	Fantastic game 9/10.  Visuals are amazing on any setting above medium. Style of gameplay is completely up to you. Replayability is infinite. Audio is brilliant. The only downfall is the AI (If you have no mods on), the settings for their skill levels needs a bit of refining. It's either they're as dumb as a stump or so smart that they drop you before you can even get ready.  Definitely recommend.
236	1	a	How to play: -Spawn in on altis life -buy a prius -drive 50 miles north to cocaine fields -get cocaine -drive to process cocaine -sell cocaine -get cash -drive 100 miles rebel outpost -buy megaguns and ammo -go to airstrip -GET EARRAPED BY 4 WARTHOGS -get a helicopter -go to Kavala -try to bandit -get â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ by the local police -die -disconnect -quit -open up gta5  9/10   
125	1	a	This game ruined my life...   It started out as just a fun little casual relationship, y'know, just 'oh i'll go on a multiplayer server and go play for a bit' sort of typical gamer-game relationship.   I saw there were no women wondering around... I wanted to fix it, y'know, quick fix, something to do, some options for people...   That was three years ago. now I can't even go to the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing shop without wondering how I would bloody model it and put it into this godforsaken game! it has latched onto my life like a zombie baby and is sucking all of the energy clean out of me, I can't sit and have a good play session without noticing a bug in something and trying to fix it. I now instintively open max and model when I turn the PC on, and everything I model makes its way into the game somehow, I'm in a group of modders and I swear they are a cult worshipping the Arma franchise, I can't stop myself, it's literally an addiction... I need help.   Okay on the more serious side... this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ING AWESOME... if, IF you are that strange masochistic type of person who loves near simulation levels of combat realism and marching across huge maps.   I'm talking PURELY from the standpoint of an Arma 'purist' if you will, not a DayZ convert, not a lifer.  Okay so the biggest pro of this game by far is the modding capability and the community, as a member of the modding community I can say just how much you can customize this game and make it your own breed of wicked software.  every major aspect of the game can be changed and it's one of the biggest and best points of this game I can truly sing the praises of.  You can add new islands, new characters and character assets, new weapons, new vehicles, new missions, new game modes, new interface aspects, you can add true to life elements such as radio comms, and ballistics. All through addon content, trust me, if you're like me and you are a sucker for variety the storage space taken up by the mods is about 4 times as much as the actual game does.  The support Bohemia Interactive have for the modding community is fantastic, by far one of the most supportive developers of modders I know, providing a variety of tools and support to help you make addons, in fact in this most recent instalment they even take direct inspiration for extensions of the game from modders themselves, from interface elements like stamina indicators and Virtual Arsenal to actual designs of assets, such as the new ENVG in the APEX expansion.  The Arma modding community is bustling with friendly helpful people ready to help you get a leg up if you're struggling. and that's hosted by Bohemia interactive themselves, not a third party.  The DLC BI makes is very much an extra platform for mod makers as much as it is extra content for players, and they've made it so that these core engine features in the game are available to everyone, not just owners of the DLC, making it a much more fair and universal system.  Other pros:  The freedom you have within the game, it's not on rails and in corridors, it's a vast open environment, open world if you wanna call it that. if you wanna go halfway across the HUGE map to hit a target at the perfect angle you are free to do so.  If you wanna kill one guy with a helicopter, and there's a helicopter available, then hot damn you can do that.  if you wanna nuke the damn place, download a nuke mod/script and live out your sadistic fantasies of pressing that red button.  â¥â¥â¥â¥ i've found myself, before today, just putting a truck down in the editor and going for a drive around the island to kill some time rather than people, you can do that too, y'know, be a pacifist for the day.  You wanna roll in first person? done you wanna roll in third person? done  you wanna look around with your head and not your entire body? done. you wanna play as a guy with pink face paint? mod it, and done! wanna attach a machine gun to a rabbit? with some jigging in the editor, consider it done!   Zeus lets you rationalise your god complex: and that is exactly why I love zeus game mode. someone in the server is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ me off and i'm zeus they can see to it that they'll have a nice lightning bolt of 'shut the â¥â¥â¥â¥ up'  you can place down cars, planes, entire hordes of enemy troops for four guys to fight, and laugh meniacally as you watch them squeal.   With recent updates, the visuals are now so much nicer, and things run a little smoother overall.   APEX itself is a pro, like seriously, just for Tanoa, just buy it already.     Cons:   Multiplayer sometimes isn't fantastic, since the advent of DayZ and Arma Life, 9 year olds have found another game to disgrace the presence of, not fun, not saying i dislike those platforms, just the kids who ruin the good experience for the rest of us, especially when our hard work in the modding community is used and abused without permission.  The game's performance isn't fantastic, BUT, BUT hear me out here, you can do A LOT about that the sheer number of options available to you ensure that in some degree you can get a good framerate. The sheer complexity of the engine means it needs quite a lot of CPU power, so bear that in mind. I've put my PC specs down at the bottom and I get fairly okay framerates on ultra high settings, you by no means need a Â£1000 PC for this game.   It has a few quirky bugs like the AI with Xray vision and dying if you're lying prone on a rock, i find the latter happens rarely these days.   It loads like a dead snail, it's my biggest gripe with the game, is how long it takes to load I HIGHLY recommend you install it to an SSD, it's much faster.   You will LITERALLY not see the light of day if you get into modding this thing, it takes away your life.    When you love this game like I do, you put its faults aside and just damn play it.   my PC specs: AMD FX 8320E @3.2Ghz AMD Radeon R9 380 Sapphire Nitro 4gb 16GB RAM   For the record: modding this game gave me my first ever step into the games industry, so if you're serious about your â¥â¥â¥â¥, come to the dark side...    TL;DR   Buy this game if you want a tactical sandbox shooter that gives you so much freedom to do whatever the â¥â¥â¥â¥ you want its unreal, and you have a half decent system and don't mind a few quirks here and there.  Mod this game if you are serious about getting mad skills and a possible first step into the games industry if you refine it enough.   Also mod this you want to literally go insane  help me...
3767	1	a	You like being a soldier?  You enjoy playing in a clan? You want almost full Realism?  50 - 200m are close quarters for you? Get this Masterpiece!  (Except if youre an Altis Life, Wasteland, Exile etc. â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, go suck a keyboard)
707	1	a	'rifleman 600 meters'      where?
4057	1	a	i would like to test arma 3 out can you make it free for like 3 days please?
1562	1	a	First time playing Arma 3. Launch and join an RP server. Meet a cop who's very helpful since I'm still working out the controls. Buy a car and don't know how to unlock it. When finally get in the car, get rammed into and kidnapped by two strangers. Strangers hold me at gunpoint then shoot me in the head.  10/10 would be a hostage again.
2598	1	a	Its alright yeah.
4038	1	a	Verry fun many bugs
4635	1	a	Great gameplay,graphics and content, but can be daunting when first starting out. The tutorials are a must and also watching video tutorials helped a lot. Definitely worth sticking with.
3768	1	a	A game where you can do anything except having more than 30 FPS... AND jumping.
2157	1	a	Best military simulation ever.. Can't beat this game
5418	1	a	My most played game on steam ever.
2353	1	a	GREAT GAME 100% awesome you can do so many things
1033	1	a	This game is so beautiful it puts a video game to real life. If you're looking for a Military Simulator this is the one beautifully done, great structurely built multiplayer and singleplayer.
830	1	a	Great game to play on spare time i highly recomend Arma3
3253	1	a	Hopped onto a role playing server and died by flying 30 ft into the air while getting out of a truck. 10/10
2047	1	a	I still don't know how to use the gps 10/10
1942	1	a	On the first day of Christmas Arma gave to me this annoying d*ck piece of sh*t laaaaaaaag I mean seriously, optimise it pls because sometimes in areas with lots of buildings you get a drop from 60 to 15 fps and in general it is very CPU-dependant game. And for all the addons you have to pay loads of money, but i guess the quality kinda compensates it but still. Apart from that I think this is the most realistic and fun to play at the same time war simulator and I totally recommend it. P.S. Also the community is very nice and friendly on most servers, so it's so much fun to play with them + loads of different gamemodes and workshop stuff make the game so much better and gives you so many different things that you get to experience (I put this separately because I don't think it links to the development of the game itself, but more of community stuff, but I find it important information for the people who want to buy this game).
3169	1	a	Never played it and I honestly don't know why I was able to write this review but it looks fun
148	1	a	This is my favorite game of all time.  Pros: +Extremely realistic (AI acts intelligently, weapon handling depends on fatigue, distance, etc) +Great community (for the most part) +Thousands of great mods (try Exile, King of the Hill 1944, Breaking Point, Battle Royale, Epoch, etc., all available for free from Steam Workshop. Other mods can be downloaded from  Armaholic.com)  +Ability to make your own scenarios/mods +No running and gunning- tactics and planning are the only way to win +Huge learning curve keeps kids away (this is a very good thing) +Looks great, even if the framerate is on the low side. I get 30 FPS playing KOTH on an i5-2500k with 12GB RAM and a GTX 560. Not a beast of a computer, but it has no problem running this game. +Ability to play in third-person or first-person views.  Cons: -Can't drag a fallen team member to safety before reviving (this is a big difference from Arma 2) -Updates can mess with mods -The vanilla game doesn't have a huge selection of uniforms/guns (this can be easily fixed though with mods, so it's no big deal; however, some servers don't support mods which makes the selection useless) -Still expensive. You need the DLC, as many servers require it.  In summary, buy this game if you want a mature shooter that values tactics and punishes a lack of teamwork. This isn't a twitch shooter like Call of Duty or Battlefield; it is a game that tries to be as realistic as possible and entirely succeeds, in my opinion (note: I have nothing against COD or BF).   It is worth the money.  100/100
2419	1	a	This game is so much fun and each time i play it i cannot stop playing it.. If you play with friends it makes it that much better but without friends i have the same amount of fun.
2727	1	a	If you dont mind a slower experience, this game can provide a massively varied experience.
4117	1	a	Best Mil Sim I have ever played been playing it since Alpha and I have no complaints. GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!
4491	1	a	If you like DayZ style mods, this is the game for you.   A true survival sim, yes you still have to use your imagination and yes there's a steep learning curve but it's worth it if you think you have what it takes to be a survivor.  -Breaking Point (DayZ with factions) -Epoch/Overpoch (DayZ with base building and more guns) -Exile (Haven't tried yet but it looks like to be the best 'DayZ' out there atm  Keep Calm And Respawn
3743	1	a	Played a bunch of Arma 2 when it came out, finally got the money for this and i love it
4369	0	a	Despite the great eye for detail, the animated character and the beautiful landscape, this game definately does not earn a 'thumbs up'. The main reason for this is because the game is full of crashes. This evening is as one of the many others where I wanted to join arma but I couldn't, all I did was just scavenge the weirdest websites in order to find ways to get around the crashes that I stumble upon while joining servers. I am at the point of thinking Bohemia doesn't even care about how well arma 3 runs anymore: even on high-end game pc's fps never reaches higher than 50 in cities, it keeps on crashing and there is a lot of other weird stuff such as sudden deaths due to rocks in-game or hostile stairs while walking over them.  I love to play the game, but the game just won't let me. -1
3055	1	a	The Most Realistic Army Simulator! The Graphics Are Incredible And The Added Features Make It A Good Game.
3659	1	a	Nothing out today touches this game. NOTHING. Been going hard since 144kbps DOOM 4-way, Quake1-Netquake, Quakeworld. Etc.. You get the point. This is the one and only that stands far out from the rest. Nothing comes even close. I am still awaiting for years the game that can come close. Nothing yet. Huge learning curve thats the only downside so dont be a lazy fk. Those who cant mustard it up have to hack the PBO's are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥es so watchout for them hackers, they are few and far between due to guys who run and operate Breaking Point they are strict.
666	1	a	10/10 would get confused with contorls and stop playing for months.
3912	1	a	I loved this game when my computer was good after about 6 months or so the game started crashing and getting low frames but before my computer turned into poo I loved this game but soon my time with the game was over ans wasnt able to play anymore if you want to take the risk take it. If you think this game is cool the review aren't stopping you buy it! 
1184	1	a	ItÂ´s Arma, so I canÂ´t recommend it, if you ever played arma withhout beeing a fanboy you know the flaws and bugs it has cause theyÂ´re still the same as in arma 2 and thatÂ´s how easy it is!
802	1	a	I've been playing 'Arma' since it was called 'Operation Flashpoint'. I have bought every version, and every addon. In all those years, the only thing that really changed is the graphics. This is both a good thing, and a bad thing.  Arma in its various iterations is first and foremost an infantry combat simulator, the vehicles and aircraft are mostly window dressing. It is not Call of Duty. It is the closest thing to real world infantry combat you can come to without enlisting. The AI, for infantry, is generally very competent in most conditions. Occasionally, their odd, out of character behavior seems very lifelike, even human. I won't go on at length, but at times, they'll behave very realistically.  Unfortunately, the AI is also the game's biggest shortcoming. Vehicle AI have always had the driving competency of a near sighted fifteen year-old Asian girl. They run into and over things/people with alarming regularity especially if they get near buildings.  They will occasionally wig out and glitch in place, or enter a Customer Service Feedback Vindaloop that never ends. I have lost count of the number of times I have executed my own team, which is at least quite therapeutic when the frustration becomes too intense.  It is in many ways a fantastic game, and when it's working right, it is absolutely glorious. When it's not working you'll need to take frequent breaks or risk chucking your PC off your balcony.  It is also still a 32-bit engine, which is horrifying because it is EXACTLY the kind of game that would benefit massively from the additional resources 64-bit would provide. I hope they get around to doing that eventually.    Despite it's flaws, for anyone who is a keyboard commando, a mouse marine, a wannabe soldier, or a real soldier looking to relive his glory days, this is pretty much a must have, and Arma 3 is the best and most beautiful itteration yet. Just make sure you have a bottle of aspirin handy.
4575	1	a	such freedom, very tactics, much stress wow
3161	1	a	Great game. A must buy for anyone looking for a great simulation first and or third person shooter. Overall great game you will not be disappointed. 
1723	1	a	Everything you could ever want and more! even better with mods :D
2432	1	a	Awesome game if you like arma 2 you will love arma 3 despite the amazing graphics it plays pretty well and there is a ton to do. I'd say buy this game but at a risk of you may not be able to run it considering its such a cpu intensive game I hope you enjoy It like I have though Have Fun!
1450	1	a	Amazing game with much to do and many mods... ARMA, naver fails to Amuse me :)
4850	1	a	I will rate this game very 5 ways VERY SPECIFICLLY:  1. 5 points for physics/ballistics (very life like) 2. 5 points for gameplay/style (if your looking for that real gritty down to earth COMBAT experiance this is your game) 3. 4 points for diversity ( from weps, vehicle, guns, its not too much and not too little. just right although perhaps a few more rifles) 4. 4 points for tactical (in order to be succesful you must work as a team in this game, i didnt give it 5 because of the lack of communication quality between squads) 5. 1 point for optimization( HORRIBLE HORRIBLE optimization. Good or bad pc we all basically get the same level of performance wth higher end pc's pbvoiusly getting a LITTLE TINY bit better performance)   this is the major flaw which can kill this game for some. FORTUNATLY for ME i have a pretty powerful rig so i can opt out 31-37 fps in cities with 75+ people online. which in all honesty is RIDICULOUS but boehemia is what it is.   MY HONEST OPINION:  If you sick of disney-like run and gun war games liek BF4 or COD and want a more real play experience \, i'd reccomend this game HIGHLY.   +=+WARNING+=+ If you think you are going to get amazing graphics AND above 40 FPS (LOL) you are either nuts or rich. You WILL need the TOP OF THE LINE n i mean at least $2500 rig to run this game MAX at 60fps. but you can still run it at Mediumhighish and hope to get 30fps.   well good luck and make the best descision.
5214	1	a	Good game fixed most of the arma 2 bugs, has its own bugs but ehh :l something this big of a scale is going to be bound to have its bugs, Lags on lower end users and gives advantage to users with better graphical settings. my opinion the game deserves a 7/10.
1908	1	a	Amazing game exactly what your looking for if you like fun simulators
1766	1	a	I have PTSD from this game.
3687	1	a	Best game ever! Amazing for roleplay
2804	1	a	Most amazing game out in my opinion. I purchased a gaming pc for this game.... ð I'm sure alot of people did ð
3744	1	a	wish i could play. every time i try to load the game it gets stuck on loading profile options it's annoying
1836	1	a	THE reason to buy a PC instead of a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ con*ugh ugh*...
4137	1	a	This game is addictive. Yet it has tons of bugs, it's fun. If you are concerned that you won't like it, try watching some Altis Life videos on youtube, and buy the game when it is on Summer or Christmas sale on steam. Now, lets get to what really matters. There are two sides to this game. There are the RP servers, and then there are the MilSims. The RP (RolePlay) servers are easy to get, it deals with Altis and turns your gaming experience into a life, which then you have to develop your character and become friends (Or enemies) with others. You can mug, kidnap, and â¥â¥â¥â¥ (If you're experienced) other people. This gamemode is for if you want to have some laughs, and a â¥â¥â¥â¥ ton of fun. If you are wanting the military simulator part of this gamemode, then go check the Millitary Simulation Servers. There are fewer of them, but they can be still be fun. This gamemode provides a damn good simulation of War on Altis. Ranging from hardcore strategies to commanding your troops, this gamemode emits a real life enviroment for you to practice your gaming skills in. That's all, hope it helped! (By the way, I reccomend this game a lot, mostly for the people without large â¥â¥â¥â¥ing anger issues.)
245	1	a	Buy this If you like Military action that is more realistic than the run of the mill shooter. ARMA has almost everything you want in a game. Action, suspense, easy to learn hard to master and Explosions.  CONs: Clunky UI Bad performance on low end system Slow actions in game such as drawing your weapon or putting a wounded soldier you are carrying down.) Enough Button keybinds to make you go Blind  PROs: The modding community The Multiplayer The Communaty in general. So many Cars, Tanks, Jets and Choppers all of them are driveable. Want to lead a squad of players on a mission to retake a City? - ARMA has you covered Want to fly other guys to and from the fight or provide close air support? - ARMA has you covered Want to setup challenges create missions or even run a game of your friends live provideing obstacles and enemy encounters on the fly? - ARMA has you covered  This game is awesome, and the multiplayer is what makes this game so good. A Few Examples of mods that I play ALOT: King Of The Hill by Sa-Matra - Three Player Factions Fight for a City using every tool at their disposal. DOMINATION: A Commander directs troops, and guides Squads of players on missions against AI, that pop up accross the map. EXILE: Every man for himself - Make money on mission or hunting players and get better gear.  I Love this game PS. There is a go cart addon where you drive gocarts. I dont know why, but there is :-D
2258	1	a	Love it, engine isnt great...still? but none the less a brill experience
686	1	a	This Game is just bout the most amazing thing I've ever played, and the Zeus DLC adds on tens of thousands of hours of gameplay onto the already huge playability factor... Some glitches, lots are pretty funny to witness in a subtle way... And the Modding community is crazily active. I would buy this again if I had to, steep price, but it is entirely worth what you pay. This game coming from people who have had contracts with different governments to make accurate virtual battle enviroments for training.  ---GET IT---
1449	1	a	played it abit, its ok
3398	1	a	Very fun game with all the mods and fetures avalible; fun with friends or ALONE!  10/10 would buy again
3785	1	a	The best words to describe this game are incredible. I've played Arma 3 for quite a while now, a total of about 1410 hours now, and it is definetly one of the best games that I've ever played, if not the best.  Like shooters? Arma 3  Like Roleplay? Arma 3  Like Strategy? Arma 3  Like MilSims? Arma 3  This game offers it all!!
2575	1	a	this game is the best
4096	1	a	Arma 3, the game of the century. One of my all time favorites. Hell, it is my all time favorite. I have been gaming for most of my life, and have yet to find another game that I play or played as much as this one. I have been PC gaming since 2013 and started off with Arma 2 and Operation Arrowhead. I didn't get Arma 3 until about May of 2014. Then did I realize the immense amount the game has to offer. From racing go karts to fighting in Vietnam Arma 3 has brought everything to the table. Bohemia has done a great job but not recently when they haven't been able to find out a few problems such as the texture bug. I still do enjoy the game and all it has to offer and I really want to give it up to the creators of the mods and everything because it really pulls everything together in the world of Arma. That is just my two cents though.
2740	1	a	Besides having to pay to get most of the game's content, this game has so many possibilities and gamemodes to play. It is lots of fun and keeps me coming back.
4867	1	a	arma 3 is for scrubs. joe is a â¥â¥â¥ 10/10 wouldn buy this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ again
75	1	a	It's not a good 'game' for newbies. No, it's not...  I use to sit at a place and watch the sunset. I had no idea how to actually shoot, drive and complete missions.  It's like my personal sunset simulator. And it's damn beautiful.  10/10
3615	1	a	LOVE IT.
4633	1	a	Did two drug runs. Bought a gun, took two people hostage. Made them phone the police. Killed two police officers. I was then tazed and arrested, then put in jail. Someguy flew in with a helicopet and broke me out. 11/10.
4787	1	a	I mean seriously? It may be a laggy piece of absolute cow â¥â¥â¥â¥. But it's Arma â¥â¥â¥â¥in 3. 420/10 Would Blaze.
982	1	a	Why is this not on your games list? Get it. Now.
5226	0	a	its good
4800	1	a	prob one of the most underrated military shooters ever
3511	1	a	Arma 3 is an A-MA-ZING game! It offers a lot of gamemodes and that makes this game incredibly fun to play. Over the past two weeks i have become addicted to ARMA (in a good way) :-). So, where are you waiting for? Buy it already!
3513	1	a	a wonderfully flexible, detailed and immersive milsim.  great modding support and a community that doesnt dissapoint.  a worthy addition to your gaming collection
5228	0	a	There's a famous World War I quote that says warfare is 'Months of boredom punctuated by moments of extreme terror.' Replace 'terror' with 'frustration' and this game does, indeed, give you the True Combat experience written on the tin.  From the description and tutorial missions, I was expecting a military simulation with experiences like 'The commander ordered my squad over the radio to go to grid point 134-190 and hold the bridge, so we mounted up in an APC and fought out way there to hold the line against the enemy advance.' Basically, I expected a much deeper and more realistic version of Battlefield -- like the Falcon 3.0 and Gunship 2000 military sims I played when I was a teenager but with infantry and tanks and tactics and whatnot.  What I got is... nothing like that.  The single-player is more like what I would call a 'walking forward simulator.' Seriously, my left middle finger started going numb from holding down W while following the squad leader character across a field for 15 minutes while only encountering two enemies. Of course, when I DID encounter enemies I tended to get shot in the head pretty quickly because the AI can see right through the oh-so-realistic scrub brush that covers the landscape whereas all I could see was the tangle of bushes in front of my face with a big red 'TARGET' box floating in the middle of them. Then the squad leader guy stepped on a landmine (the only one in the world apparently -- of all the luck!) and I started following some other guys across another field for even longer, only this time with an ambush of several lethal bushes a few minutes out from the save point.  After snoozing my way all across the field and then getting killed in the same spot about a dozen times I thought 'Okay, maybe the real draw here is the realistic chain-of-command combined arms multiplayer scenarios, let me try that.' So, I popped into multiplayer... and didn't see any of that either.   There were scads of 'RPG' servers where I could play as a random villager, AKA playing Walking Foward Simulator toward the corn field at the edge of town and trying to earn a bit of money to buy food at the market and not starve. True combat gameplay, right?  There were 'Wasteland' servers where you spawn in the middle of the continent somewhere with nobody around and only a vague suggestion of what you'r supposed to be doing ('fortify a base, gather supplies and hoard them') and of course a half-hour walk to the nearest point of interest. I wandered around the airport for 10 minutes looking for supplies or a vehicle, found nothing, shrugged and disconnected.  There were also 'King of the Hill' servers which at least featured combat. Well, actually they mostly featured waiting for helicopters to respawn. The objective was to go from my team's base to occupy a town about 1.5 kilometers away, which equated to a half-hour walk, a ten-minute drive (assuming you didn't run over a bush, which would pop your tire and then it's back to the half-hour walk) or a one-minute helicopter ride. So, helicopter was the obvious choice, but those only spawn every few minutes. Half the time some jerk would crash his truck into the helicopter and destroy it so we'd have to wait again. On the occasions I actually got to the airspace over the town, I would jump out of the helicopter, open my parachute, and generally be shot to death while dangling in the air. The one time I parachuted out early and walked for a minute to get to the town, I survived for a good while sneaking into the town but didn't run into any enemies to fight... eventually I got bored of that and ran to a tower to see if I could snipe people from the top, but as soon as I peeked out over the railing I got shot in the head.  So, was it realistic? You bet. Months of boredom punctuated by moments of extreme frustration. Was it fun? Not really. I had a lot more fun playing LUFTRAUSERS while waiting for it to download. Overall a colossal disappointment. I'm so glad it was a 'free trial weekend' -- I would have cried tears of rage if I had actually paid for this thing.
3186	1	a	My favorite game of all time is also a flawed mess. Let me explain.  Similar Games: Insurgency, Operation Flashpoint, Battlefield (in some respects)  Pros -Unforgiving hardcore tactical gameplay. -Realistic damage model. -Intense, Cinematic firefights that will have you at the edge of your seat and get your adrenaline pumping. -Co-op and PvP is amazing in this game if you play with the right people. -Has one of the most dedicated modding communities I have ever seen. -Easy to mod. -Many official and fan made gamemodes that are a blast to play. (Favorites: King of the Hill, CTI, Liberation, Insurgency) -Detailed open world enviroments. -Destructible buildings. -Overall a fairly welcoming community. -Dynamic gameplay, hardly anything is scripted. -Combined Arms gameplay. -Variety of roles to fill within a squad. (Ex: Medic, Sniper, Grenadier, etc.) Vehicular combat is also a thing. (Tanks, planes and helos are all included.) -Large scale battles among varied enviroments. (some modes simulate an enemy army moving along the map.) -Easily the best co-op game of all time. -The game is in constant development, with updates on nearly a monthly basis fixing issues and adding improved mechanics. The dev team seems to listen to requests of the community as well.  Cons -VERY steep learning curve. (You will get destroyed a lot when you begin.) -Bugs. Many Bugs, mainly collision issues which can be problematic, especially during PvP modes. Getting stuck on objects is common in this game. -Performance varries and is hardly based on your PC specs. (Most of the performance issues in the game are due to slow server speed and the amount of AI/Players that are accounted for at any given time during a game. The faster the server is the higher the FPS.) -Single player can be really dry. You will get hardly anything out of the game if you only play single player. -Clunky UI that takes some getting used to. This has been improving. -AI varries in intelligence and reaction time. This has been improved in the recent updates, but it is still pretty bad. -Only for a certain audience. -Some of the animations look rediculous.   Overall  I have had a fantastic time with this game. It is a clunky mess, but at the same time there is no game on the market that provides the same amount of freedom as well as tense, heart pounding gunfights that Arma does. However, the barrier to entry is so high, I think the only way to enjoy this game is to know someone or even better, a group of people, who play it regularly to show you the ropes. If you try to get into this game in any other way, you will have an absolutely miserable time. As I may have said earlier, a huge aspect of this game is the Co-op and if you play with people you don't like your opinions on the game will follow suit. Another thing to consider, is how niche the game is. Research and/or try before you buy.  10 out of 10 -As contradictory as this verdict might be considering all the problems this game has I cannot deny the amount of enjoyment I have gotten out of this game so far and the several hundred hours more to come out of it in the near future.  This game is for: Players seeking a tense, challenging, stress indusing, tactical shooter to play in cooperation with other like minded people.
651	1	a	this game has many modified servers making it worth every penny, and even though it has a full inventory of vehicles it is incredibly difficult to stop playing even if you change server it has details you will not find in most games of its kind.  on different servers and on singleplayer mode it is not a walkover, and you are challenged with the full feel and suppression war brings with good graphics quality and huge map enviroments citys and towns to explore.  i feel as this game should win more awards just for the playability alone and incredibly varied choice of things to do in game its quite simply never ending , the maps are very very big. 20km what game makes you travel that distance and your still not quite where you want to be . there is always a little more to see with all the mods that are being done in multiplayer Â£20 this cost me on a pre release alpha .   the best money i have ever spent so much so i bought 4 friends a copy of this game ...... . and ive never done that in 30 years of gaming.  update .... the amount of hours i have put into arma 3 is over 4000 now mainly on one multiplayer server . but having tried many i feel happy with the life servers . ALTIS LIFE at ts @  sealteamsloth.com  the life servers replicate working robberies, bank heists and many both legal and illegal activities . an all round well blanced community helps . but hard to keep trhat way at times with new people just not reading the rules ,copying their watched videos and trolling to no end . hysterical at times   the wasteland is an obvious military style game type with an arsenal of weapons to be found by scavenging around the island then by team blue or red you take the fight to the enemy . or you go solo in greenfor killing anyone in sight . so a more single minded tactical strategy is needed to  survive . one can get weapons by buying them at often with enemy watching gunstores . so an all round awareness is needed to get in and get out alive as its often a sniper haven area .   the sights on your weapon are vital to success at distances exceeding 200 metres or more . and can be found around the islands and gunstores .  the ability to get your soldier to settle before shooting in distance fire is needed to aim accurately. i cannot stress this enough at long range shooting distances.  often a soldier on the slow move is the best at distance and close up contact .   but it is terrain dependant also . the best way to find out your weakness is to play on a public game server .with the weapons of your choice .  one has to just get in the game to get better at it .   map, navigation and compass are vital tools to easily find your destination and objectives .  strategy is needed on most game modes and servers with many choices and decisions to make a quick game experience of different game servers will help you improve your skills . the ARMAÂ£editor, is a a 3d enviroment now with many tactical options and decisions to be made . with arma 3 you can play for a year and still not be anywhere near completion of the game . it is the best money i have personally ever spent on a game .  there are always new mods and options to try new servers with arma 3 . one just has to get into the role and read the rules set by the server where applicable or needed.  many servers have admins watching / playing which helps out a lot with issues and glitches we find as arma 3 progresses to a better experience for us all.    failures . glitchy actions sometimes the occasional lying down to stand glitch can happen . but overall a great experience when using teamspeak which is free to download as a communication aid between you and your team .   there is other in game communications and chat one can use . task force radio being one also.  my first server i ever played on was an american server an experience i cant forget . the bravado and communication skills are needed to communicate in a effective manner so a microphone is needed for quicker communication in your team or group,  even groups can communicate individually and between each other with channel commander and task force radio options .  sound . well you will need to adjust your sound options turning down the music and renaming your soldier in your profile to suit your batallion or group you play with . optional. in profile . some servers have built in ear supression by pressing a few keys together so only chat can be heard. and other sounds reduced . in game view distances are a helpful aid also to aid in viewing enemys so adjust accordingly between playability and safety.  graphical quality ... arma 3 will use whatever you throw at it and you can still not get full view distances unless you use the top graphics cards out there and often in sli or dual configurations . but anything from an NVIDIA 750ti or higher should help more .the Nvidia 970 is best for price today so dual cards will beat a 980 but not on GDDR5 memory as it cancels to 4 gig on the 970. so be warned get a good system with intel 4th generation or above i5 or i7 series cpu, to get the best from arma3 . yes 6th genertion cpu,s will beast this game the 6700k is probably the best option. today .but not needed should you not have it you will still gain by using a high core cpu even on AMD systems one can have a great experience for less money as many gamers do . quad core 4ghz is a fair balance as arma 3 is cpu intensive. on 1 core , but one can change the pc options to perform better should one need to.  a good sound program is vital if you need to survive long on arma 3 , but not absolutely vital to play the game . 5.1 0r 7.1 headsets are a bonus and work just on lesser priced pc,s through the usb or front jack options. razer are an effective way to quickly gain surround sound in game and the higher priced turtle beaches are an option also but if im fussy i would use the Astro A40 or astro A50 to get some real sound quality to the game .  so the learning curve is high when coming from battlefied 3 or 4 or counter strike games . but the footstep function can save you or your team if you have it in close town battles .  a well coordinated team policy is just part of the excellence that arma can provide when engagements are in your sights .  the game updates are just an important part of playing arma so do it often or when they are shown. see you on the game if you have the right stuff. you probably do ,and if you do not .you soon will.
3216	1	a	Awesome game having a lot of potential definitley worth playing despite poor campaign which never been though strenght of bohemia interactive games
4060	1	a	The Arma series has become an amazing masterpiece throughout its past 15 years of development. With backing from previous games and mods such as Arma 2 and the DayZ mod the developers have made it into a work of art. Arma 3 really finalizes the series for me, with more DLCs on the way and improved bullet ballistics and combat realism this truly is the mil-sim to rule them all. Along with the addition of the Apex expansion came more weapons and vehicles which drastically improved gun variety and the number of combat situations. Overall amazing game and I would definitely reccomend it if you like 'Serious Fun' (in Shack Tac terms) then you need to get this game.
457	1	a	Realistic drug dealing experience. It's all about the hustlin. Can't never escape the Stratis ghetto. Packn' gats. Rollin past da police at 110.

4416	1	a	Best game, played it a lot.
1201	1	a	Still early days for me yet as I am still learning, but what I have seen from this game so far is nothing but awesomeness...   VAST LANDSCAPE - the map is absolutely huge... some players end up having a full time job air lifting people to the hotzone and then back to base and pick up the next lot of soldiers...  The GRAPHICS - are absolutely spectacular  THE SOUND - is amazing, really is an immersive experience  REALISM - The most realistic military game I have ever played... if you are a Call of Duty fan... forget it, get out of this page and do not buy this game... You cannot go in guns blazing, you cannot even run from cover to cover without getting puffed out in which causes you to lose accuracy... Battlefield players that feel that Battlefield just doesn't have enough realism, you may appreciate this game as I am an ex-battlefielder and I love this game...  THE BAD - Extremely hard... and there are soooo many buttons to remember, but practice makes perfect...  9/10 - it loses a point because you cant just pick it up and play, it requires lots of time, practice, patience and discipline.
3275	1	a	I got the game while it was free for two days and it was awsome, I loved everything about the game, but it was a little to graphic for my windows 7. But trust me this is worth 59.99. But make sure your PC can take the graphics.
2537	1	a	Great Game - Love it
4421	1	a	&gt; Buy Arma3 after playing 2 &gt; Seems alright &gt; Spend 800 hours in milsim &gt; Play on milsim server as per usual one night &gt; Next morning go to school &gt; Kid drops book on ground and makes the classic *SNAP* noise &gt; Had to stop myself from dropping to the floor behind a desk and yell: 'Where is it coming from?!?!' &gt; 10/10 would PTSD again
2265	1	a	Really an amazing game will all the different mods that one can play.  Eg. best mods for me is WASTELAND, ALTIS LIFE AND BREAKING POINT. 
1538	1	a	This is one of the best games i have ever played!!!
2154	1	a	-I have to go to base tomorrow, but wait, game night's not over yet. One more game...  So far it's pretty much the best milsim out there, bar none. I do wish for a mod to include realistic reloading animations and a mechanic that recognizes bullets in the chamber.  Negatives are the extreme amount of Wasteland servers out there, and complete lack of proper pvp servers that are friendly for playing without friends.  For better or worse, unless you, for some inexplicable reason, actually LIKE the Wasteland mod, you're better off playing the co-op servers where it's you, 20 or so other folks, customizable loadout ammo crates, and places on the map to clear of enemy AI. Game looks good, and it's a real treat for such a milsim to look good, and have alot of potential draw distance.
5405	1	a	It's THE BEST.
182	0	a	Arma III is a good game with a good concept of what it is trying to do. They have started to roll out the campaign, finally after a few months after realese. What helped Arma II was the modding scene and even just the mission files for multiplayer which will further improve the life of this game, as this seems to be the direction that Arma III is going and that for one thing is excellent. This could spur some very interesting gameplay and I am hoping it would catch on with groups such as ShacTac or LSG just like in Arma II. Graphicly the game has improved alot from its predecessor, implimenting modern lighting and just looking far superior which may not matter for most people but it is a nice addition for the game.   Now for the downfall. Not everyone has this but many people do. The game has severe problems with performance and not knowing how to utilise CPU and GPU properly.  (http://i.imgur.com/pkwvj34h.jpg   http://i.imgur.com/RQog0QF.jpg)  These two screenshots show the utilisation of the game and it is quite clearly awful. Playing the game at 10-25 FPS is not possible. You are at hinderance when playing with this sort of preformance. The BiS developers seem like they are trying to avoid this problem, moving threads to less noticable places is one of the ways basically just outright trying to get rid of the people complaining. This feels like bad practice for the company acting this way towards their paying customers.  When it comes to problems such as this they seem to respond very badly. A similar problem a while ago caused them to reply and they said it is 'too hard and we are not willing'  (SOURCE:http://steamcommunity.com/app/107410/discussions/0/864961722019263834/  ). Really I do not think they should be developing games if things are going to be to hard for them. They are letting down customers and it is a real big shame because this game is really promising.  Finally PROS: Excellent Multi-Roll Military Sim Beautiful Graphics IMO Way Smoother than Arma II ex. shooting,aiming Altis and Stratis being very versitile and can make for interesting gameplay Improved physics with bullets and vehicles The ragdolls!  CONS: Severe performance issues and utilisation The sound assets could be better (That is nothing mods cannot sort) Game feels incomplete having only a select few vehicles/weapons The campaign only just being rolled out again feeling incomplete  Thanks for reading!    **Edit 
2131	1	a	It is a game for 3 year olds and up
4674	1	a	AWESOME SAUCE FOR $32!
770	1	a	I love this game its very fun and alot like a simulation.It does take some time getting used too the controls but after you can have a blast playing it.
2854	1	a	10/10 Game been playing this for awhile and can't stop playing it.
2005	1	a	I was in a heli , on my way to the sky i saw a squad of 4 people was flying almost over them shout in direct communication ALLAHU ACKBAR and crash the heli into them.   heli/4 would allahu ackbar again.
4435	1	a	roleplay to the point of it being depressing and stop playing it for weeks
2783	1	a	This is a fun and clever military experience, that does a great job at making you feel like you're on the battlefield. It is hard to get use to a first, but in time, you will learn the basics of Arma 3
4190	0	a	Never played an ARMA game, but I really liked BF2 Project reality and Early Tom Clancy FPS games. The pre-order was half of the future retail price and included Alpha and Beta access--so I thought I would give this a try. What I found was a half baked game that was overly reliant on expected croud sourcing assets. The game was bare bones with almost no missions, the engine was sub-par, controls not thought through, and gameplay generally uninspired.   If I'd bought a physical copy, I would be selling it right now.  Huge dissapointment. If you aren't already a fan of the franchise, you may want to pass or at least wait until it goes on sale for &lt;$10.
2331	1	a	Really fun with friends atlis life for the win or king of hill
1487	1	a	a very nice game 99 out of 100 for me a nice game its very easy to learn the basic controls but to learn all of them you have to invest alot of time in it i play it till the alpha and the fun is remain the only thimg are some bugs and hackers who dont get banned and hacking the servers for example they destroy all the vehicles on the map or something like this this sucks a little bit but at all its fun to play it
1647	1	a	A lot of mods and a lot of fun.
845	1	a	Arma 3 has to be the best game I have ever played. It has one of the best communities possible and the amount of addons for the game is unreal. A must have!
818	1	a	1.Purchase Arma 3  2.Install Breaking Poind Mod 3.Never ever play Dayz Standalone/ Epoch/ Overpoch 4.Uninstall ALL Survival Games  5.Play Breaking Point 6. Enjoy my whole 1,700 hours of breaking point
4499	1	a	some one plz buy for me
3559	1	a	Literally using my friend's dead body as cover in desperation.       One of my best Memories.
678	1	a	I played it a little. It was okay.
4448	1	a	The vast amount of game modes will keep me entertained for hundreds of hours and I've only played two of them! Altis Life is fun and wasteland mode is some of the most intense FPS action I've ever played.
5349	0	a	How could this still be this bad.. still playing arma2 witch is much better
3709	1	a	You can almost do everything! But the most inportat is... YOU CAN KILL RABBITS!!!  Just get this game. its awesome!    10/10 
3904	1	a	Arma 3 is an AWESOME rpg just buy it
304	1	a	Much better than the others  Feels like you are the soldier rather than just controlling some robot  Pros - Great gunplay - Awesome graphics - AI will â¥â¥â¥â¥ you up - PvP is a blast when it is only players and no AI  Cons - Bad singleplayer - No good PvP servers - Playing online will drop your frames (Horriable for PvE) - Some guns feel lacking  P.S There is a DayZ mod for this game called breaking point which is fun and has great optimization
295	1	a	ARMA 3 is a game in a class of its own and defines the genre of tactical military simulations. One of the greatest benefits is the modability and vast amount of user created content, that can be implemented in this very open sandbox. The first part of the campaign 'Survive' showed that Bohemia Interactive made their game also interesting for singleplayer, but the true strength of ARMA 3 is for sure the multiplayer.  Don't get me wrong - this game needs a certain level of dedication to get the maximum out of it, casual players probably won't get happy. If you want a unique mod- and mission-setting you cannot just create a game and simply 'hop in'. Hosting a MP-server with mods, creating MP-missions that work flawless with mods - all of this stuff can be quite complex and hard to be learned by one person alone. But if you decide to join a group or community that suites your style of play (action-, hardcore-simulation-, roleplay-orientated or somewhere in between) then you might get a most interesting and challenging game experience.
1802	1	a	If you own a PC and don't own this game. What are you doing?
4309	1	a	arma 3 is the best game i own must bye 
420	1	a	I was planning on buying this game for an huge ammount of time, when it was in sale last week I bought it. I mostly bought it for Altis Life, but then I met the amazing modding community of Arma 3.   I bought Arma 2 for DayZ and I felt really sad when there wasn't a DayZ mod for Arma 3 (except Breaking Point). After some time playing I saw that my friend bought the game too and we played a lot together. It's really fun when you're with friends.   The game is great and it is worth it's money.
2124	1	a	As a FPS fanboy i have played FPS games for many years mainly these last years bf3 and bf4 my favourites. Compared to Battlefield, Arma 3 is insanely more realistic and is basicly the closest you can get to a miltary simulator. I have had alot of fun playing this game with friends. Then again it can get too realistic for an avrage FPS gamer like me. 7/10
3654	1	a	I primarily play Altis Life, and where some servers have more rules then others, you can definitely feel like a true cop as you tase people for doing absolutely nothing wrong whatsoever. 10/10
5124	0	a	The engine looks nice, but based on the older operation flashpoint engine still. Entering houses feels 'iffy' and like walking around on honey - god forbid going prone in one... it's like the house knows judo.
820	1	a	Very good game with a lot of different play scenarios! Love this game
2309	1	a	its the bes, has a varity of mods its awesome!!
5265	0	a	This game is a waste of money.... It's the buggiest game I ever played, sounds are late like Mexican movie... Player gets tired like he has a hangover, and the AI its on speed, its almost impossible to catch up... Man just don't buy this game I wasted 40 bucks on this terrible game....
5282	0	a	Don't be deceived by the trailers, Arma 3 gives you the impression its a more tactical Battlefield shooter. It is that by all means, but it's centered around the tactical aspect. Missions can take up to 3 hours to complete and just the training is enough to throw a seasoned shooter off. Training will have you snipping targets with an assault riffle. I get that most ex soldiers in the US today enjoy this game because it's very similar to real life hostile engagements, but I honestly felt like I was having to camp like I see bad players doing in Call of Duty. More power to you if that's what you like to do, but I for one enjoy Halo, Gears of War, Rainbow Six, and Ghost Recon. So I didn't get that close ranged tactical cover to cover neck snapping stealth urge I needed satisfied. I don't recommend this game quite simply because the type of game it is, not so much it being bad, because it's surely not a bad game. I play Warframe way too much so I wanted something a bit slower and more tactical. This game seems to be nothing but that. Too much so for me. Just download and try it. The first 40 minutes should give you enough to decide rather or not its for you.
1077	1	a	The only game that I'm willing to play on 30 fps with constant drops.
1912	1	a	Arma is love, Arma is life.
5115	0	a	This game crashes constantly. I have yet to play a full multiplayer match because it freezes within 10 minutes of playing every time. I have a high spec computer and play other games on highest settings. When I try to play Arma 3 on lowest settings, it crashes. This game is what we call a complete failure. Save your money for a game that actually works.
3314	1	a	Can your PC handle the awesomeness of arma 3? If so, put this awesome game in your library! (Get a steam key for 30 bucks on green man  gaming.com) 
746	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ING AMAZING! Everybody should own this xD
81	1	a	Want to survive a hostile island full of haters?  You can do that.  Want a to survive a zombie apocalypse?  You can do that.  Want to scavenge for weapons and battle each other and be the best?  You can do that.  Want to run a small guerrilla army and take over Altis?  You can do that.  Like to role play island life?  You can do that.  Want to create lots cool scenarios?  You can do that.  Want to snipe your enemies or fight a conventional war?  You can do that.  Want to fart rainbows and ride a unicorn with a laser cannon horn?  Maybe one day we'll have that.
835	1	a	Despite it's flaws, the infantry combat is two steps up above ArmA 2, adding much needed fluidity to once an extremely clunky interface. That coupled with the inclusion of Play withSix granting users an easy way to access the hundreds of user-generated content (a requirement), makes ArmA 3 worth getting at full price.
4549	1	a	Amazing game! Two thumbs up.
3578	1	a	But only with mods:P
2838	1	a	SUPA HOT FIYA, I SPIT THAT.
4452	1	a	Amazing Game would recommend to 100% Everyone
1901	1	a	a fun game to play solo or with friends with better modding system than arma 2 10/10
444	1	a	ARMA 3 a Mans shooter.  Arma 3 is a greater shooter, its got a steep learning curve and lots of complex mechanics but once you get used to the game it can be great fun with an interesting enough campaign but mainly a huge amount of multiplayer mods that really make the game what it is, from life to battle royale there is something for everyone. Just note the game requires a good PC for a steady frame rate.
2504	1	a	Love it!
1208	1	a	I think this game is a great military sim.It combines teamwork with tactics and mixes it up with mods and good bots that will give you a run for your money.Now ive only played this for the free weekend so I cant give you a super good reveiw but I will say that from what me and my brother played that this game is vary fun and challenging game and we will definetly buy it in the upcomeing days
2603	1	a	Everything I expected over the years of not having a PC strong enough to handle this has now come to light and it is everything that I expected. Nothing more..
10	1	a	A fine installation in the Age of Empires series that has a greater emphasis on combat as well as teaching you about things other than human resource management and medieval history lessons. Instead, you will gain a deep knowledge of zoology and learn how to beat up people and steal their stuff.  General: &gt;Zoology Lessons â Some things you will learn: Capybaras and tapirs live in Central and South America, Ibex, Saigas, and Marco Polo sheeps live in central Asia, Serows live in Japan and the rest of Asia. &gt;Japanese Daimyos can materialize samurai out of thin air. &gt;Shogun Tokugawa is a wizard that can open portals to other worlds and summon the likes of monks with clubs, shinobi that shoot grenades using their bows, and entire artillery companies. &gt;The original American Continental Marines were an army of Japanese Ronin Samurai mercenaries. &gt;If you throw a lot of torches into a building, it will not burn. However, it will break apart and then finally explode. &gt;Native American fire pit dances generate magic that they put to use in battle, putting Warcraft spellcasters to shame. &gt;Medicine men, surgeons, and priests all perform the same healing magic. &gt;Even standing near an idle monster truck could be lethal. &gt;Even before the creation of the United States, George Washington always knew heâd end up on both the quarter and the dollar bill. &gt;As an Asian power, you can ally with your enemy through the consulateâ¦ and still wage war with their forces with soldiers from their own home country. &gt;Chinese flamethrowers never burn anything, they just kill it and blow it up. &gt;The British employed the use of longbowmen well into the 1800s. &gt;Cuauhtemoc of the Aztecs is a cool guy; he has a blood fetish and refers to himself in third person. &gt;Queen Isabella so desperate, sheâll sleep with Cuauhtemoc &gt;Akbar of the Indians is worse than a fervent Jehovahâs Mormon as he constantly attempts to convert you to his religion (Hinduism) while beating him up. On the bright side, he canât nuke you like Gandhi. &gt;Russian strelets are a gift from the Aztec blood gods. &gt;Russian strelets are equipped with large foam axes and airsoft muskets. &gt;Created an Iroquois home city called Toronto, named the warchief Rob Ford. He smoked crack, befriended blowgunners and blew up his own city. &gt;As another reviewer simply noted, you can beat up monkeys and steal their money. &gt;The Haitians hoped that their new ironclad warships would be their knights in shining armor. They turned out to be their morons in aluminum foil. &gt;The story of the original Thanksgiving is full of lies, propagated by the capitalist pigs in Washington. The true story goes as follows. In 1603, Shogun Tokugawa wanted to construct a new shogunate palace. He sent a group of Japanese pilgrims across the ocean. A few years later, they landed on Plymouth in New England, an excellent place for a new shogunate palace. There, they befriended a native scout and his pet intrepid scout turkey. Shortly thereafter, a group of allied Chinese pilgrims came ashore and set up shop alongside them. The Japanese and Chinese came together for a great turkey dinner. HOWEVERâ¦ The French and the Ottomans landed around the same time and did not take kindly to what they saw as encroachment upon their lands. A great war ensued in which the Chinese and Japanese ultimately prevailed. In the end, a great Thanksgiving feast was held in the new shogunate palace with Tokugawa as the host.  &gt;SPECIAL EDIT: Indestructable outposts  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZbC69DS_D0   Civilizations: &gt;You can beat up the British and steal their tea. &gt;You can beat up the French and steal their military victories. &gt;You can beat up the Dutch and steal their tulips. &gt;You can beat up the Portuguese and steal their secret liquor. &gt;You can beat up the Spanish and steal their dogs. &gt;You can beat up the Germans and steal their beer. &gt;You can beat up the Ottoman Turks and steal their turkey. &gt;You can beat up the Russians and steal their vodka. &gt;You can beat up the Iroquois and steal Hiawathaâs poetry. &gt;You can beat up the Sioux and steal Gallâs gallbladder.  &gt;You can beat up the Aztecs and steal their bottled blood. &gt;You can play as the Japanese and steal your alliesâ food. &gt;You can beat up the Chinese and steal their many inventions and claim them as your own. &gt;You can beat up the Indians and steal their elephants and then beat up their sacred cows.  Campaigns: The campaigns of the base game and The Warchiefs expansion provide an interesting story that follows the Blacks, a family of mostly brutal dark magic thieves. They can create entire armies and civilizations that a can appear and disappear within an hour. However, they end up being known and portrayed as heroes as they more often than not beat up bad guys and steal their stuff. The Asian Dynasties have similar stories but are completely unrelated to the Black Family.  Blood â As Morgan Black, &gt;Beat up the Ottomans and steal their cannons. &gt;Beat up pirates and steal their maps. &gt;Beat up the Spanish and steal their money. &gt;Beat up the Knightâs Templar and steal their water.  Ice â As John Black, &gt;Mock your uncle Stuartâs lack of masculinity despite the fact that he packs the most powerful right hook punch in the entire New World. &gt;Beat up the Cherokee and steal their cannons. &gt;Beat up the rogue British and steal back your damsel-in-distress girlfriend Nonahkee. &gt;Pursue a rogue British general across North America with a fleet of monster trucks. &gt;Finally, blow yourself up and prevent the Knightâs Templar from leading a Russian invasion of America.  Fire â As Nathaniel Black, &gt;Beat up the British and steal their colonies. &gt;Beat up the Hessians and steal back your damsel-in-distress mother Nonahkee. &gt;Win the Revolutionary War with giant stone busts of George Washington that crush and trample entire armies.  &gt;Level the British forts at Yorktown with these colonial titans while they proclaim, âCheck in your wallet. Thatâs me on the dollar bill.â  Steel â As Amelia Black, &gt;Beat up rival companies and steal their railroads. &gt;Beat up the Sioux and steal their land. &gt;Beat up the Knightâs Templar and steal their money.  Shadow â As Chayton Black, &gt;Beat up the Sioux again and steal their land. &gt;Beat up a Civil War veteran and steal his money. &gt;Beat up General George Armstrong Custer and steal his mullet.  (Asian Dynasties) Japan â As General Kinchiro (Batman), &gt;Beat up Japanese daimyos and steal their land. &gt;Note: The Japanese can run mid-19th century steam trains in the early-17th century.  China â As Captain Huang,  &gt;Beat up pirates, Indians, and Aztecs with your shirtless partner Lao Chen, and then completely cover up your presence.  India â As a sepoy named Nabir, &gt;Beat up your own countrymen and steal everything they have. &gt;Shoot your commanding officerâs bodyguard and just walk away. &gt;Beat up the British and steal their saltpeter. &gt;Beat up the British and steal back your elephants.  11/10. If you donât have the money to buy this game, beat up someone and steal their money.
2821	1	a	In my opinion, Arma 3 is the best military sandbox currently available on PC.   The game has a bit of a learning curve and the base game can leave something to be desired but, the sheer amount of mods/custom missions available add countless hours of gameplay, which is almost as staggering as it's expectional predecessor (Arma 2).  10/10 Army Men for Adults.
3742	1	a	Best Military Third/Fps game ever,,,, Ground breaking graphics makes war even real ,, tactics and planning every step you take is awesome ,,, Great war atmosphere ,, Unlike Cod/Battlefield You have to be aware in Every step you take Cuz You can be shot 400 miter away . Best Simulation Game Ever. XD
871	1	a	Truly game that can call its self a simulator.  I have tons of fun with it and i always get amazed at how good the graphics look. There is a ton of things to do. you can play around the missions of the single player displaying all kinds of combat situations. You could create your own made scenario and share it with others. You can also live edit the combat events with the new Zeus patch while playing multiplayer.   The game also features an realistic ballistic system including bullet drop, shooting through walls (also decreases damage), and bullet speed. and these are effected by the type of weapon you use and what kind of ammunition.  Also the game has a lot of vehicles you can mess around with. Boats, cars, tanks. Helicopters, planes, drones and even submersibles. And if that isnât enough for you than you could visited the stream workshop for many more vehicles. Weapons, and combat scenarioâs.  I defiantly approve of this game! 
4693	1	a	WTF....... 260 ping and getting kick curse you Battle eye..... and all password server......
1100	1	a	A game crafted with love and care - A good game!  I really love to play this game, Â´cause you have so many opportunities to play this game - Its f*cking awsome!  You need to get that game!  Totally worth it! 
385	1	a	Its ok i guess
4426	1	a	Great game..
771	1	a	THIS IS A GOOD WAR SIM
2307	1	a	I have played over 500 hours on this game now (OMG!!),  Since the first time i played this game, every minute on it has been worth while. The amound of different game modes on this game is endless. Altis Life, Battle Royal, King Of The Hill and much more!!.  Personally i enjoy Altis Life the best as i have found an amazing communtity to play with  (sawclan.net) . This game is so fun and is worth every single penny.   The graphics on this game is amazing especially when you find yourself in the middle of no-where, the views are out of this world.  Overall i reccomend this game as it can fill everybody's needs, apart from some of the hakers that decide to ruin this game (but every game has this), this is one of the best games out there!!
4703	1	a	This game is very fun and open and alot of things to do. The singleplayer is very amazing with the stunning graphics and visuals. The audio is somewhat clear, but I can understand people clearly in chat and I can hear gunshots and explosions from a long distances and it is very cool. The multiplayer side is amazing and playing from the combat simulation with others to the Altis Life RPG addon and to the epic zombie survival mod of DayZ to surviving and fighting in the world of Wasteland. Last but not least, the editor for Arma 3 is very good, but very advanced to understand right away, just get used to the basic things of editing until you can create large scale battles with the editor. This game is not for the regular FPS players, this game is way more intense in my opinion than Call of Duty or Battlefield. You actually have to plan and use tactics to get the job done and the maps are very large and you can't run forever. So at first it might be irritating for new players, but you will get used to it. Very fun military simulator and it is very addicting. This game is a thumbs up! :D   12/10
159	1	a	Arma 3 is a tactical military shooter, it has an unique spot in having the biggest maps with most players combined. Imagine yourself 120+ players in 2 or 3 teams fighting it out incl vehicle warfare... Tanks planes helis even boats included in that list, described at the shop description arma really sends you to war. The bad side is that this comes at a cost of at least a good pc to even being able to play it to full potential. And even then you limited by what the servers can pull off, eventually you will enjoy the game a lot more in smaller groups.  But arma 3 is not all about war, with steam work shop full of content or not to say the least about 'armaholic'... Arma 3 has so many possibilities that you won't run out of content to play quickly. With arma life which pretends to be a GTA with real players as cops medics and military. Included with gangs and your own choice to be the bad or the good guy and fight it out in the wild wild west. Or mods based on the older arma 2 mod DAYZ still to this day better than the standalone... But also with more known game styles like KOTH which is more a team death match with a level and money systeem.  What the best side and also directly the worst side of arma 3 is that everyone can hire a server. Games can never really die in this way, look at how many still play arma 2 daily... When a game dies mostly seen in EA games shutting down their servers, arma on the other hand will never really close down. Aslong everyone can hire a server whenever they feel like it... Great community can grown upon this but also people can abuse it, with scripts with saved slots as example. Pay the server owner â¬10.- a month and you can always play (join the server because only vips(donator) can join the last 20/30 slots). While every server has to pay hes server rent, servers with scripts like this or those that show xx amount of players always on the server is a big issue. (mostly combined to too double the effect ofc...) It is funny because i've been admins on several servers, have seen how it has been run from several different points of view. And none of these server owners have ever used or felt forced to use any of these scandals so yes i'm surprised... While most just hire the server as a kind of donation to the game or those who get real donations from community members help the game thrive.  Arma 3 also has a great single player game the voice overs are sometimes weak to say the least but it goes... I won't really call it a story, although a story is being told, just see it like a training course for the multiplayer. ;) Arma 3 also gives you a very strong but still simple 3D game editor whereby making missions is as ease that everyone can do it. Or also known zeus which makes you being able to play as a game master, you can make missions or sent waves while you friends are playing. It gives you an eagles eye of view of the battlefield and gives you the tools to spawn and do almost anything you can Imagine. Arma 3 is one of those uncut gems and well worth every penny you put into it.
2984	1	a	This game is okay, said no one ever. This game is boring, said no one ever. This game is too much like call of duty, said no one ever. The mods in this game are awful, said no one ever. This game is awesome, said everyone ever.
1346	1	a	I would definitely recommend this game, if you are in to tactical â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and great graphics. 10/10 stars
4936	1	a	People realize this game is a MILSIM and developed for it! Exile and Altis Life are modifications and don't blame BI that they â¥â¥â¥â¥ed your server isn't their fault. BI creating a game for military simulations not a dayz or altis life there is other games to play if you want exile buy DayZ if you want Altis life go play smth else but this game is for military simulation and don't cry!
5186	0	a	nice graphics, good mechanics, fun setting, powerful real-time editor, wide variety of things to do, large modding community, workshop support.  can't jump 1/10
1050	1	a	Best mil-sim shooter out in the market. Honest review of ARMA 3 in the video  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fh3webkCo4Y 
19	1	a	we want Age of Empires 4!!!
4535	1	a	One of the best FPS games ive played by far recommend to anyone
5203	0	a	do not buy it if you want to keep your sanity
2875	1	a	This is an amazing game it's swallowed up a lot of my life with a lot of different servers to check out and explore, ranging from Roleplay servers to hardcore Military simulation.  The ArmA 3 community on the whole is great, however if you are looking for 'Community spirit' when playing a Roleplay server such as the 'Life' series, I'd go ahead and not even bother purchasing the game.  Otherwise, this is a very good game and I would reccomend this to anyone who has the spare time that it will consume.
1135	1	a	this game is the best game ever
4586	1	a	This is a very Fun game and worht the money if u like it sure some parts could be a little berter but over all it is a really good game I can get 30 FPS on a muitiplayer server with a 500$ labtop
1932	1	a	its fun for a couple of hours
4528	1	a	Good game, Its fun and it's cheap for a big game so get it :)
5216	0	a	'Oh DLC, meh, not a big deal, I can probably take the weapons off dead bodies or maybe use them for a while as a trial.'  *Gets in game*  'Sweet, killed a guy, better snatch his sniper rif-.'  *PURCHASE DLC NOW TO USE THIS WEAPON!*  *Uninstalls game*  This is what I get for supporting these guys for years. Way to go...
5414	1	a	good game, can flip cars with go-karts
183	1	a	Much better than the running simulator.
4533	1	a	  20 fps is more like 60 fps in this game :P
1962	1	a	Very fun game! Though dont play if you don't know â¥â¥â¥â¥ about teamwork!
4843	1	a	nothing to say,and Great Game. (i'm Speechless)
2983	1	a	its da bomb....is good
3228	1	a	This is, hands down, the best military simulator available. There is a steep learning curve and it's not very 'plug and play,' but A3 can deliver an incredibly rewarding experience if authenticity and realism are up your alley.   The Arma series has proven to be both a fun combined arms shooter as well as an invaluable training tool.
2949	1	a	We destroyed a helicopter so hard, it crashed the server  10/10
164	0	a	Sad, What was once a great simulation has turned into a big middle finger to loyal followers. DLCs that should have been released with the original game because let's face it, Even on release, it was still a beta. I have followed Bohemia since operation flashpoint and I loved their games and their attention to realism.....Arma 3 could have been so much but releasing half dlcs instead of the old good hardy dlcs you use to get with Arma 2 and still not fixing glitches, I can no longer support this game. Heck, even all the arma clans that switched to arma 3 is suffering membership loss due to the unplayability of this game on multiplayer and that's where this game really shined at one point. It's a sad day.
680	1	a	You can Play dead in this game
1768	1	a	Arma 3 is truly a great game, when it comes to arma, there is no boredom. Just when you think theres nothing else to do, check the workshop, make your own mission, join a new gamemode... Theres always more!
5179	0	a	Its a simulator alright..... just not a war simulator. Its more of a walking around/ driving around simulator with occasional shooting. I am going to attack this game.... it won't be pretty.... so if you are faint of heart or have fan boyingitis you might want to not read. Ugh.... but where the â¥â¥â¥â¥ do I start? From the moment you start playing this game it will hit you with 1000s of extremely bizarre design decisions that defy all logic and reason. Like for instance, there is THREE buttons for standing, crouching, and going prone( I may be thinking of dayz, so forgive me if I am wrong because they both just kinda melded into a big â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ pile in my mind). I mean most games manage to only have one button for this WHY THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ WAS THAT SO HARD TO FIGURE OUT THAT THEY ENDED UP WITH THREE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING BUTTONS?!?!?! Just the excessive amount of buttons on your keyboard this game uses is unbearable and requires frequent control checks to even do basic things like â¥â¥â¥â¥ING CROUCHING. Then the game has a third person 'option', but anyone who is anyone knows that if there is an option for third person in a fps that you use it. It lets you â¥â¥â¥â¥ing see around corners, so congratz on giving us that option..... Then there for some reason is TWO versions of zooming in, one makes your person scope in PURELY WITH HIS OWN EYES LIKE HE IS SOME KIND OF SUPER HERO and the other uses your weapons scope. Then we got the insane fall damage. Do you remember playing on the jungle gym at school and jumping off that â¥â¥â¥â¥ like a boss without even a scratch? Well in arma if you jump from that height as a grown â¥â¥â¥ army man you die. Yeah idk wtf............Its shameful..... truelly and I am only scratching the surface, trust me its alot worse then I can put into print.  Alright so lets talk about game modes, Its probably got more then I can imagine, but lets talk about the three I experienced. First team death match, sounds good right? WRONG! Actually it may have been king of the hill, but â¥â¥â¥â¥ if I care it still sucked. Well your objective was to go into an area and control it which is perfectly fine, untill you take into acount that you spawn LITERALLY 2 MILES away from the area EVERY â¥â¥â¥â¥ING TIME YOU DIE. This isn't like the bf version of spawning far away, in there you always have a way to get to the battle faster like spawning on your team, here you always spawn in the same stupid field with a couple transports. *Sigh* Ok so you get in the vehicle and start on your way to the hill....... thing... where the team death match happens and everything is going ok(slow and boring, but ok). THEN SUDDENLY AN ATOMIC â¥â¥â¥â¥ING BOMB SHOOTS OUT FROM HELL WHEN YOUR ALMOST THERE AND INCINERATES YOUR WHOLE CREW! Then you respawn back in the field(more like purgatory) and wait for the transport to respawn, so you can begin the EPIC ride back to the...place?   WAIT A MINUTES IS THAT A â¥â¥â¥â¥ING CHOPPER? OMG IT IS! You quickly run over to it and get in! AW YEAH THIS GAME IS GOING TO FINALLY GET FUN! NOPE! You couldn't have known, but the chopper controls in this game UIBUASDHGIUADBGD!!!!!111! Sorry, they are bad.....they touched me in my no no place and they were coded into the game by cthulu him self for ONLY HE FROM THE DEPTHS could possibly comprehend this madness! Even 'good pilots'(their words not mine) only manage to make it 10 ft before critcal engine failure occurs. Then the real PRO MLG ARMA pilots that actually can fly them by some miracle don't even try to land the damn things. They tell you to just jump out and parachute because they know damn well it will explode if they even barely tap the ground. The first time I ever even got to the holy hill was from parachuting and it worked suprisingly well, so I guess they managed to do something good. I died almost immediately from someone camping in a window, but I at least gazed for a brief moment on the promised land.  Then we got this strange free roam game type with factions. I don't have any clue what it was called because I imagine my brain deeply repressed it into my subconcious to be forgotten. It was the best by far of the arma game types I played, which puts it at about free flash game levels of quality, but at least it was tolerable. Kinda, I guess..... Well anyways you spawn on an island and you fight with your other faction members for control of the map. Its got stores and stuff to buy vehicles and guns, but mostly you will be getting SNOIPED by people hiding in houses like rabid neck beards. I can't imagine these people having any fun sitting In houses, hills, or trees all â¥â¥â¥â¥ing day for that ONE KILL, but for some reason in every game that uses this â¥â¥â¥â¥ arma engine(such as dayz) these people are all over the place. WTF is it about these games that draw in these campers? Is it because they get kicked out of or mocked for being noobs in every other decent fps? Yeah, probably.... Lets go with that.  Then the final game type I played, if you can even call it that. RP or atlas life or something, who cares. Yeah I tried out a roleplay server because I figured it would be maybe like gmod dark rp, where fun is always the most important part. ROFL you bet it wasn't fun! You start out as just a civilian, but you can mine and make money! It is literally even more boring and more work then real mining, so I promptly gave up on rp. At that point I would just get a real job mining because at least then I would make real money for my hard work. Yeah I wouldn't suggest you ever play this game, even if your real life is more boring then working. I would personally reccommend you stare at a concrete wall and try to see shapes before I would tell anyone to play this game.
4595	1	a	Great Game! worth every cent!  
4813	1	a	awsome game! :)  but can get very boring if playing alone on altis!
4768	1	a	This game is really pretty.
783	1	a	The only game I look forward to playing at the end of my day!
2622	1	a	Well, having clocked nearly 1300hrs on this game, I have a great idea of what this game can and cannot provide to what a player would expect to find inside. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for a team based game, if you run solo, you will most likely end up dead very soon. This is nothing like the Battlefield series or CoD. Arma 3 is it's own type of game. It takes hours to march from one end of the larger map, Altis, to the other. The vanilla Arma 3 is good as it is, but the sheer volume of mods and community created content will ensure you almost never get bored of it. Arma can provide everything from small 2-5 man squad insurgency operations, to 100+ player all out war, to post-apocalyptic survival in the Breaking Point mod. This game is, however, not without its bugs; take for example when I tried flipping an MRAP with a tank, only to have my tank launch in the air 300m and kill me when it landed. But good and bad combined, this is by far the best game I've played in a VERY long while. 10/10 would recommend.
1177	1	a	Installed the game. Started tutorial. Went on the field. Started shooting - was disappointed. I shot a rabbit for fun, didn't die.......... after 5 seconds the rabbit slammed on the ground. 10/10 best game ever
632	1	a	This is a very fun game with stunning graphics and amazing amount of detail. This game looks breathtaking and have so much multiplayer cappabilty. However the content included with the game at this stage (July 2015) is very limiting when comparing to previos ArmA games such as ArmA 2 and ArmA Opeation Arrowhead. However what orginal content this game lacks is made up for in the extensive amount of mods this game holds. There is everything to suit your needs to zombies, base building (if you liked Dayz Epoch) and then relism mods and there there are RP mods. This game is great and keeps getting getter. I would recomend the DLC espically if you intend on playing mods as they will give you a great advantage.
5364	0	a	I will never ever buy another mistake (Bohemia Interactive game). I trusted this company and purchased this game in Alpha. Not only did they deliver a buggy failure. They have the nerve of releasing expensive DLCs that are meant to be included in the game. And announcing new games when they haven't even finished whats on their plate. This developer should be renamed as EA v2.1  Never again BI, never again.
813	1	a	Super fun and realistic (in terms of actual warefare and game/vehicle/weapon mechanics) game with a great community, and great community made missions.  That's about all there is to say about the game.
337	1	a	Best game you can ever have!
2931	1	a	I LIKE THIS GAME
925	1	a	Great game, flawless graphics and minimal online bugs.  Great work
2744	1	a	Lots of Fun with a group!
1138	1	a	ArmA 3 feels like, ArmA. Good,fun and kept the ArmA 2 feeling very well. No more need to be said. 
3727	1	a	As much as I wish that BI would add more modern weapons, I know they added the AR-15 platform to the game with the Apex DLC and there are mods but this game is pretty damn good, even without them.
2717	1	a	most realistic game i have ever played it has the best physics and to say the game is still being developed is such a good sign of things to come in the future keep up the good work  i would definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys realistic combat simulators and has the time to spend on this game
2275	1	a	.
2072	1	a	Most realistic Military sim out there! The physics engine is crazy as hell and realistic as possible, although it does â¥â¥â¥â¥ me off when u fall 5 feet off a rock and u die.... Bohemia u gotta fix that crap! Overall its amazing and has so many gamemodes and ways to have fun! Did i mention the editor! you can make ur own games or just mess around and place enemys and any vehicle u like to have fun with! great game 10/10
3644	1	a	If you like the smell of VDM and couple of baldies this is the game for you. :standingchicken:
826	1	a	This is one of the best games around on pc. There is so much to do from killing zombies to being a realistic tatical war game. It has brought me and my friends countless memories and is still doing so from running away from cops with 50 pounds of weed in my car to haveing intense shootouts on a wasteland server.  Pros Great game Super fun Open world Huge map lots of people to play with LOTS of gamemodes  Cons NOT OPTIMIZED (gtx 980 with i7 4770k on ultra gets 20-40 fps on multiplayer servers) All rifes sounds the same dlc's like helicopter and marksmen should have already been in the game   Conclusion Its an awesome game with alot of fun things to do but not optimized at all  
932	1	a	10 out of 10 would bang
2649	1	a	sunk way to many hours in to this and still yet to get board
809	1	a	So much game for the money. It's more than just another shooter game, there are loads of mods available which increase playability of this game hugely.  From dayz style zombie survival mods to flappy birds style atv flying. Race around Altis in go-karts or try and complete the sky track in a 4x4. Get serious with a sniper mission, or get scared on a horror map trying to find the mothman. Have a second life, rob people, sell drugs and buy a house on Altis life or survive and build your own base on Overpoch. Team up with friends and take over a village from terrorists or become superman and take on an army yourself.  Some of my favourite mods include Overpoch, Altis Life, Wasteland and Battle Royale.  I highly recommend Arma3. You all should get it! Lots of hours worth of gaming here. Entirely worth full price, even better value if you get it in a sale.
1378	1	a	Good game, much wow. 10/10 would do it again.
3288	1	a	Best shooter I have ever played, all you need is a descent pc.
736	1	a	Best milsim actually.
388	0	a	The dissapointment is strong with this one... The game has some 'cool' features but is more frustrating than having explosive â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥how at your dates broken toilet. You get to use then new stances with ONLY the basics guns. Trying to do a half-kneel with an RPG or binocular to minimize detection, forget about it. Great uniforms (like in ARMA 2), combat gear (not much to choose between), and guns (worst sounds of the year award goes to...) The sight are also great, i especially love the extremely dirty reddots, that makes it seem like this 'soldier' has never heard of cleaning his bloody equipment. Trying to be sneaky? FORGET IT! EVERY footstep sound like a rhino trying to dance, he SMASHES his heels in the ground every damn time.  The engine and pshysics in this game are TERRIBLE! Basically, they took features we loved about ARMA 2, and replaced it with some very buggy, unrealistic, not working, pieces of of bad jokes!  Their marketing campaing is ALOT like EA! You have to buy things that is pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥ing crucial for the gameplay - that cost ALOT of money, and still does not make the game work either!   Having the courage to admit that your game is SO unfinished that EA would not even realease it, and releasing the final things neede for it to be an actual 'Military realism shooter' for free, could make up for the buggy game. But instead you crave money for everything, even though the game is pretty expensive to start off with.  ARMA 2 -&gt; great game, but with awful pshysics and engine. ARMA 3 -&gt; Like a car without wheels and windshield. PLUS you are still stuck with the awful physics and engine!   So, if you end up buying this game you will end up needing to buy ALL the DLC's! Because they wil CONSTANTLY remind you that you '... ARE MISSING THE FOLLOWING DLCS'  
964	1	a	Great Game With Altis Life Mod
4003	1	a	This game is one of my favoutites and you just dont run out of things to do, there is all these custom missions, and lots Of different gamemodes only con is this game needs pretty good computer to run with max graphics
4031	1	a	Awesome game recommend it to everyone !!
3545	1	a	Best friggin game ever. Been playing Arma 2 for years now. Will play Arma 3 for years to come. If there is an aspect about this game you don't like, then theres probably a mod for that! Seriously, check out mods like Arma 3 life, epoch or breaking point. Arma 3 is not just a fun game by itself, but the mods make this any gaming experience you want it to be.   If you like FPS, this is really the only game you need!  
1536	1	a	Arma 3 Is the modern combat simulation of 2013-2014. Actually that was a lie. Arma 3 is anything you want it to be. A First Person Shooter. A Role Playing game... Arma 3 fits all genres. If you want something and have the means to make it. You can. All because of the new Arma 3 Engine. Personaly I think Arma 3 knocks Battlefield &amp; Call Of Duty off the board. Even if most people think the faces on Arma 3 look like total crap compared to other shooters on the market. Graphics don't matter, it's the content of the game that's most important. Plus Arma 3 is open world. No scripts, no dumb game barriers, no seeing through walls crazy AI's. Everyone's game expirence is different depending on their actions. I mean Arma 3's Maps like Altis and Stratis are just plain MASSIVE! I 100% reccomend buying this game regardless of the type of computer you have. Well obviously you need to meet minimal requirements to even play the game. Also people who have Intel HD Graphic's Mobile. You may face some difficulties. Get Ready To See Real Warfare.
3209	1	a	This game is honestly one of the best game you'll ever play, i can barely run it (15-30fps) yet i had so much fun, you have a high end intel processor, you'll have a great time.
326	1	a	Overall, the game is pretty good. I myself can say that I am somewhat pleased with it, the Map is HUGE and very fun to explore it's just with a 200 square kilometer map you would have more then just 14 air vehicles, maybe more planes and helicopter. They did mention they will be releasing new DLC for the game thank god I bought this when it was in Alpha. Otherwise I wouldn't be buying all that DLC. Bohemia in my opinion needs to step up their game and realise there is more to please then just the general European public. :)
3310	1	a	Arma 3 is a very realistic game, It has many different posabilities.  The pros are the graphics and style of gameplay. However the downfall is the dlcs which must be purchased to unlock all the game content. I would have preferredfor it to be in 2 different games like arma 2 and arma 2 OA.
189	1	a	This game has a very steep learning curve and difficult controls, but once you figure it all out the possibilites are endless, there are so many different games and mods and opportunities with this game that its crazy. Like doing military roleplay and stuff? Join a squad and do unit gameplay. Wanna do TDM style of a game? King of the Hill. Wanna do co-op missions? It has it. Wanna play a survival game? Millions of different types. Wanna play GTA Online without the hackers? Altis Life.   The list goes on and on. This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing amazing I cannot stress this enough but you have to put the hours in to learn the controls and how the game operates
1624	1	a	Not the easiest game to play but overall it looks great &amp; runs good &amp; isnt too bad of a game really
1679	1	a	If you like realistic battlefield and have good specs, you definitaly should play this game!
0	1	a	this is a must have for any WW2 navy geeks..ultra realistic, tough missions, great graphics, detailed modelling. I recommentd the Pt BOAT gold pack as both original and expansion are worth the price at $14.99
3420	1	a	shot a tank with a javelin, 5 guys popped out and exploded.
2994	1	a	Teleport to random places everytime while being in a passengerseat.epilepsy guaranteed   10/10
2777	1	a	1000 hours in and still learning â¥â¥â¥â¥ about this game daily   Love it
5220	1	a	An excellent soldier sim, made for the grown ups, no CoD kiddies here! The game is massive, the multiplayer is extremely good, has a great mod community thanks to the stellar Steam Workshop and the visuals are fantastic! Definately worth a buy!!
4009	1	a	tbh â¥â¥â¥â¥ vanilla game. Awesome modded game  8.7/10
2677	1	a	i played this game when it was free and it was great
594	0	a	Went in to the game based on the reviews, the only good part of it is the team capture mode which makes the game sort of like a real life war. Everything else is a waste of your time/life, game is infested with little boys who haven't even hit puberty and will bad mouth you all day, half the servers are terribly laggy and the game is still very buggy. i.e. moving next to a wall and getting ported through, walking through a glass window and getting stuck, etc. etc. Personally I feel the game was a complete waste of my money as there are many other games in this genre that do it much better and are much more worth your time, since more then half the game you will legit spend driving to nowhere land just to get a gun/money only to come back and get hit once and die. I do not recommend this game to anyone as it should be free, because that is all it is worth.
5212	1	a	Pretty good. Graphics do cause a few glitches. Sadly I keep dying in the campaign as Kerry. But besides that, its not bad. 10/10 would bang.
3201	1	a	To get dayz all you need to do is pull down your pants and bend over, if a pistol comes out of your butt you will receive your own copy of dayz :D awesome game btw
4308	1	a	The millatary experince gives intence awsomeness
4642	1	a	10/10 I have probably spent too much time in this game! The game has so many areas to it so there is always more to do. For example, there is RP mods, DayZ like mods and even servers like CTF. It is so much fun and it is a total must have!
5407	0	a	do you like wandering around in the middle of no where for 2hrs just to get killed one min into combat? do you love admin abuse? well boy do i have a game for you! its called arma 3 , if you like a whole lot of walking around and doing nothing , your gonna love this â¥â¥â¥â¥ 
3272	1	a	Do you find yourself angry at the COD or Battlefield for being horrible unrealistic? If you this is the game for you, guns, tanks, planes, boats. What more is there to say?
1308	1	a	Great military sim, far better than Arma 2 although there arn't as many vehicles as i liked. Runs better than Arma 2 beacuase of the new engine which allows alot of people to have fun and run smoother. I will be spending alot of time in this game and i recomend it for anyone that actully values a good military battle instead of something like Call Of Duty.
3666	1	a	This game is frustrating, it's dowright infuriating at times.  And I absolutely love it.  Oh, it has a steep learning curve. It's a big hill to climb before you learn all the controls, then get used to the somewhat bizarre controls (especially if you're coming at it from other FPS's). And the pace is very different from your CoDs and Battlefields and whatnot.  But this isn't trying to be those games. It is not a shooter, it's a simulation. And it's the best one there is.  - It's a true sandbox game. From the campaign to the multiplayer. And there's nothing like it out there.   - The standard map, Altis, is a replica of the real-world island of Lemnos. And me and my mates love it so much, we're saving up to go there on holiday.  - You can do whatever you please. The scouting missions in singleplayer let you explore the map and do missions, the multiplayer opens up the entire map and lets you do whatever.  - Bohemia are absolute darlings and are doing a fantastic job. Have been for years. The community is beautiful, from the players to the modders.   Oh, and one of the devs got arrested for 'espionage' while visiting the island for research. That's how committed these people are.   TL;DR:  Joined a squad as a medic. Saved about 12 people, then got shot... a squadmate carried me on his back a full kilometre to get revived by another medic.  11/10, would get shot again.
2290	1	a	One word can describe this game: Awesome. Arma 3 is a realistic military sim. Even with that in mind, for those who don't enjoy the realism, this game is one of the best FPS ever created and offers something for everyone. Map sizes are ridiculous, think of an average GTA IV map, times that by ten. Vehicle mechanics are greatly improved over Arma II, which makes them fun to drive, and gives you another sense of immersion. When your driving an armored vehicle, you actually feel empowered. As for weapons, the quality of the models, and the sound bytes are amazing. It's not like your average FPS....With headphones, every weapon sounds exactly like it would in real life, not some PEW PEW sound.   I would definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for a boredom cure, with community made mods and game types, there is something in it for everyone.
2619	1	a	Do you like milsim? Do you like steep learning curve? Then this is the game for you. pew pew
1618	1	a	Game is playable on my 3 year old laptop.  10/10.
68	1	a	I played Altis Life and a cop arrested me because I said I was black. 10/10 so realistic.
3154	1	a	Arma 3 is one of my favorite games of all time. My bro and I were looking for a coop military game with customization and this is it. If you've ever dreamed of making your own military scenerios that you can play with a friend, then this game is a godsend. Arma 3 is the reason I game on PC.
723	1	a	Very good game with endless possibilities as well as mods but lacks good optimization. You'll need a very good CPU as well as GPU to run this game on ultra with a stable 60 fps. Extended support for the next year for this game as well.
4965	1	a	IF YOU WERE KILLED TOMORROW, I WOULDN'T GO TO YOUR FUNERAL CUZ I'D BE IN JAIL FOR KILLING THE MOTHER â¥â¥â¥â¥ER THAT KILLED YOU!   ..._.....____________________, , ....../ `---___________----_____] = = = = = D ...../_==o;;;;;;;;_______.:/ .....), ---.(_(__) / ....// (..) ), ----' ...//___// ..//___// .//___//  WE ARE TRUE HOMIE'S...

4944	1	a	OMG THIS GAME!!!!  BUY IT IMMEDIATELY because with this game you gona play a lot! A well done game focused on pure realism and made for the players in mind!  It has a great game engine you never seen before, everything in the game is simulated. the guns, the bullets, the choppers, tanks,trucks,soldiers etc.  It is a tripla A title based on multiple real life islands the biggest is 270km2 wide with astonishing deatils!  And if you get bored with the original game, theres tons of mods you can play.And dont get me started on the multiplayer part wohooo, its really where the game shines!Tons of players online everyday, and top tier servers available for you without paying any addinational fees.  If every game could be this well made, we wouldnt have enough time to live our lifes....

4196	0	a	Terrible 1st impressions FPS is huge on almost every server if theres ppl its impossible to play because of the fps if the fps is low theres like 3 ppl on the server. Impossible to find a normal sever I get handcuffed for doing nothing and a lot of other boring â¥â¥â¥â¥... I WOULD ABSOLUTELY NOT RECOMMEND BUYING OR EVEN WASTING YOUR TIME ON THIS GAME
1408	1	a	I recommend this game if its on sale, but if it isn't, its not really worth 49.99 euro. But it's still fun andreally great looking.
1226	1	a	The best military sim ever!!!
1028	1	a	Arma III is definitely, without a doubt, a great game. I have played Arma III mostly with mods such as: Wasteland, Altis Life, and Breaking Point (my favorite). I have also played the Campaign which is also good. There are no other games on Steam that are similar to Arma III (except for the other Arma games ofcourse). Arma III's multiplayer experience is exceptional. The best aspect of Arma III multiplayer , for me, would be the PVP. And that's why I play muliplayer most of the time. My favorite mod for Arma III would be Breaking Point. Breaking Point is very similar to Arma II's DayZ Mod which I have played quite a lot before. If you ever get around to playing Arma III, you should definitely try Breaking Point. Another great multiplayer mode would also be Wasteland. Wasteland doesn't require you to download any seperate files from the internet so it's quick and easy to start playing on. Arma III is full of action, excitement, and adrenaline rushing moments. Do I recommend this game? Hell yeah!!
937	1	a	Played this game for over 1000 hours now and have come to realise something. The community (as a whole) is terrible.There is only ever a handful of helpful people on any of the forums, and the game is slowly losing its multiplayer enjoyability due to the saturation of Altis/Stratis Life and Wasteland servers, and it's choking the game of it's more diverse gametypes. If ever somebody tries releasing a new mod/mission it get's pushed to the side by all of the older gametypes. Personally I feel that Life servers are on their last legs, but until they aren't popular anymore every other innovative, fun, dynamic and diverse mission is cast in shadow.Take a look at the Multiplayer server list. All you can see is Wasteland, Life and the odd Invade &amp; Annex server. Quite frankly it's annoying the hell out of me. It seems that these days to get some really diverse gameplay you need to either create a private server to play with some friends, but then you're lacking the player base, join a community but even then the majority are Life-based or join a Mil-Sim unit, which many have age restrictions and timezone issues with schedules that you must abide by or you're out! Another issue is the amount of little kids playing the game. I'm 16, so I'm by no means an adult, but when I'm playing a MILITARY SIMULATOR I don't wanna see or hear 12 year olds running around like it's CoD. If somebody with a high pitched voice starts talking to me in such a way that I know they are taking the game seriously then I appreciate that. However, I've only ever come across that 3 times. If they want to have fun, by all means, but not in a way that is detrimental to the success of the mission / aim of the game, like shooting teammates just because it's a feature they haven't seen in CoD and they think it's funny to annoy somebody by always playing as a sniper and picking off targets of no importance coz they wanna see how far of a shot they can hit. These are flaws in the community though, not the game. I must admit, the game itself has some issues... *cough* rocks *cough* ...but as a whole it is a great game! I wouldn't have spent as long as I have on it if I didn't enjoy it. The graphics are stunning, they level to detail blows my mind and you get a genuine adrenaline kick during the kick-a$$ firefights that this game offers. Definately worth buying this game, so long as you aren't afraid to wade through the bull$hit for the good bits, that is...
2248	1	a	i love this game#robin
4366	1	a	Really fun. Much better with friends. 9/10
1161	1	a	Extremely Fun and has a diverse amount of different game modes 
1934	1	a	It has Turtles. 10/10
4126	1	a	This game is the best peice of junk ever. It has so many glitches and its so broken but no one gives a â¥â¥â¥â¥ because its so damn good.
1916	1	a	Really fun until a ten year old yells at you for not being tactical enough.
1636	1	a	its nice....
4626	1	a	2700hours and still playing.
1964	1	a	3,000+ Hours,  Still can't shoot for â¥â¥â¥â¥.
2789	1	a	Arma 3 is incredible. If you are looking for a game that gets as real as possible this is it, its not even a game its a war simulator. Missions are satisfying and even when they go bad its an unforgetable time.  Dont play arma without mods, you are missing the point of it.
1296	1	a	Great game, you should really consider getting it. :)
1842	1	a	A very fun gamw while playing with friends! :D
165	1	a	Honistly i dont know how the game is i finshed half the story and played a lil altis life But i just sit in editor playing with the ai all day )_)
2038	1	a	This game is the best realistic 1st person shooter,  Pros -Photo realistic graphics -Countless hours of playbility -Fun with mods Cons -Lag 10/10 would play with friends
2497	1	a	Very big step up from Arma 2, well optimised and fun to play!
2021	1	a	Good game , but in that game , it's some bugs , what will create you some nervers :) With that update is a lot gooder that last. Happy play :D
607	1	a	I started the game up and when I got onto the main menu, I crashed. 10/10 GOTY
1	0	a	The game could be really cool - and honestly isn't that bad when you get it to work. Do direct x 9 and you may get it to work for a while but it hard locked my computer after playing for a few minutes.
2531	0	a	it dosent let me play i when i get on it says no entry? 
4110	1	a	I bought this game last year and wasn't expecting to get enough game time to get my monies worth. I have definitely done that and more. This game has so much potential and the amount of mods and different types of servers to play multiplayer on is numerous. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone that I know that doesn't already have the game. Yes it's expensive but you will get your money back just in the amount of enjoyment and time you spend in this game.
2121	1	a	I don't know how to close this game Â°_Â°
1935	1	a	Downloaded it with a group of my friends, loaded into a DayZ mod server and got kitted. Eight of us walking through a valley happily kitted. One loan gunner on a hill in what i'm convinced was a different map took us all down. 10/10 would get PTSD again
1388	1	a	What kind of â¥â¥â¥â¥ is this? I downloaded the game and now i have to purchase it?
1656	1	a	Best adventure and multiplayer game,,, awesome High gaphics
1182	1	a	Finally completed my whole collection of ARMA and this ARMA is one of the best out there. The reason I am so in love with the arma series is because I will join the British Army and ARMA does help if you want that realistic military feeling.  PROS: - Amazing graphics - Great animations - Sh*t ton of mods/addons - Many players on multiplayer - Realistic army simulation - Unlimited things to do - Fun MilSim  Cons: - Not well optimized (Obviously) however I got a stable 40+frames, very high settings+MSAA with my GTX 760. - Voice acting is not the best - F*cking long intro loading screen (There is a loading screen when exiting multiplayer lobby which should not be there at all just takes time. Also for no f*cking reason one eden editor it loads for some time when double clicking a unit then causes the game to crash. Note I do have a fast HDD. - Sometimes the launcher will freeze and won't load anything so I was forced to use a mod launcher - So many errors even if you updated the errors but doesn't happen all the time  To conclude there ain't no other military sim out there that can beat this. Arma 3 is more detailed than the previous arma. If the developers ever release Arma 4 I will be looking forward to it and hopefully it will have a much better optimization so many fans of the Arma series can enjoy.
1694	1	a	LOVE ITTTTT
4576	1	a	Arma 3 is a military simulator. It's not supposed to be played like Call of Duty or Battlefield where you run and gun, but you most certainly can. It helps to play this game with other people, because the AI isn;t very helpful. There is also the problem with bugs that come with any Arma game. You will break your legs from running around, you will get trapped in the world, and you will get stuck doing simple actions; you will also love every minute of it. When you learn how to deal with these issues, the game is an absolute blast.The draw of the game isn't the base game, it is the mods. Just like Arma 2, this game will have a long lifespan because of mods like Arma LIfe, Epoch, Battle Royale, Breaking Point... just to name a few. Just be sure before to watch some videos or read the instructions on various websites before you mod the game so that you don't have to reinstall your game or spend hours trying to figure out what you did wrong.  9/10 Would fly a helicopter into a tank again, bring a friend, but please fix the annoying bugs.
975	1	a	Good game. Can do almost anything thanks to the modding support. I strongly recommend Altis Life, A3Wasteland, and possibly Arma 3 Epoch when it gets out of alpha.
336	1	a	not bugged at all
2615	1	a	Get this game if you don't have nor want a life.  :'-)
1060	1	a	A great game if you like sandbox milsims. I'd recommend it if you're looking for a new game. It is being constantly updated, and it's totally worth a try.
3556	1	a	Rated one of the best Simulator of this year, it needs some work, but mods help make it feel better made with the stock Arma 3 isn't good. Sure, it is the newest it still in development, i hope in the future they will add more vehicles and weapons
145	1	a	Step 1: Join realism server. Step 2: Get yelled at for being noob. Step 3: Join Exile server. Step 4: Get yelled at for being hacker. Step 5: Make own server. Step 6: Get reported for abuse. Step 7: ???? Step 8: Profit (?)
1167	1	a	Why do I play this so much, 10/10 would play again
2921	1	a	I truly enjoy this game. It is very fun. It would be better if the ai werent so strong. I swear it takes 10 shot in the head to kill one. But other than that it is great!
1242	1	a	Arma 3, contrary to popular belief, is a very good game. It really just depends on who you are, or who you play with. If you spend your entire time playing Arma 3 hoping to have an experience similar to Dayz, you won't have much fun. What you really need to do is join servers that are running gamemodes such as Domination, and coordinate with your entire team. Keep in mind that Arma 3 is nothing like Battlefield or Call of Duty because you have to pay attention to the global picture of the entire map rather than just what you are currently aiming at. You have to talk to your squad, even if it is people you don't even know very well, because everyone contributes to the well being of the squad. All in all, Arma 3 is an extremely fun game as long as you play it correctly.
4486	1	a	I have to say, this game blew me away the first I tried it. Here's what I think of the game:  Pros: -Realistic, if you get shot twice your dead, no regenerative health. -Editor allowing you to create your own missions. -Hard combat makes you think on how to complete said missions. -You don't always have to be the commander, or even fight.  -Multiplayer gameplay can be intense and make you think even more than against the AI. -Makes you work with your team to actually get stuff done. -Actual terminal ballistics. -Booming mod community.  Cons: -Hard to learn controls (If new to series) -Some minor bugs (This will go away hopefully after beta, so I'm not taking a point away for it)  I can't think of any more. So, overall, I give this game a 10/10.  EDIT: Just thought of 1 problem that affects a lot of people:  Optimization issues. New score: 8.5/10.
948	1	a	Plays Battlefield for years on console thinks it's amazing... Build's a new PC from scratch... Buy's Arma 3... Has Org@sm... That is all.
1681	1	a	love this game
1985	1	a	The best(and hardest) first/third person war simulator out there. Period.
2848	1	a	  Bought Arma 3. Got â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Sold cocaine. Killed friends and foes. 10/10
4103	1	a	This was so much like irl I got PTSD  10/10 Would LIVE this game again
5309	1	a	Military 'Simulator', tons of community content, flexible modding. Still some bugs that needs fixing though. 8.5/10 - highly recommended.
5003	1	a	I may not have even played 10 hours of this game at the time I am writing this review but  THIS GAME IS SPLENDID.
778	1	a	Great fun game!
5210	1	a	arma isn't like cod,bf its more like gta but more realistic, i mean you don't rly steel ppls cars you need a key/lockpick to the car and its not that easy to get money either. To get money u have to like pick apples or sell weed. It was boring when i started to play this game but it did become funnier and funnier every time. To play this game u need a lot of time i say.
4773	1	a	At first, I realized that my gaming PC could not run Armo 3. I spent years becoming a doctorate graduate in theoretical physics to have access to a supercomputer. The supercomputer was able to achieve an astonoshing -1 fps, something I didn't think was possible. As a result, it divided by zero and the universe collapsed.  6.9/10, would play again.
3596	1	a	A good Military Simulation game that allows the player to experience different senarios. The game includes Multiplayer and Singleplayer, differenciating the types of experiences that you can face in the game. DIfferent gamemodes and custom servers also makes Arma 3 a fun game to play.
215	0	a	Like every Bohemia Interactive's game, it is badly optimized, you need a quantum computer to make it run smoothly at high graphics.  Players, don't be stupid , stop playing the Bohemia Interactive's '30 fps games', so they will start optimizing them a bit more....Jeez...
355	1	a	The best slide show that I have ever played.
1139	1	a	Super fun to play with friends. Would definately recommend.
3901	1	a	I haven't played Arma 3 for that long but it's ok I guess....
1352	1	a	Bohemia please code better thx &lt;3
3968	1	a	If you are looking for something to do.  If you are bored. If you like some resistance. If you really like teamwork. If you don't like teamwork but can be around people. THIS IS THE ULTIMATE GAME!!!   You will always have something new to learn, fix, repair or just curse with this game! In game, you can create what the duck you what.  Trying to install mods, it takes time and is super complicated and rarely every functions properly, but in the end it's worth it.  I have yet to see a more complicated but fun game to play with people. Even if you are a lone wolf and just wants to sit on a hill and shoot people while your friends are running Rambo in a town.  Just saying... 2000+ hours in A2, 1000+ hours in A3, and I never feel like giving up on arma. I would marry this game. Because I would have the same complicated arguments with a wife as with this game.  12/11.9 points!
4461	1	a	You won't regret this! Unless you're FoshoTM
1083	1	a	Arma 3 is probebly the most realistic and tacticle fps on the market. (exept for the ground vehicle physics lol)
3532	1	a	Found a guy wearing a Turban. Shot the guy, stole the turban, got decimated by an IED.  11/10 would jihad again
3874	1	a	Huge game. Many scenarios and Mods to get lost in. Low frame rates on many servers for me. Decent fps when i play Solo. Amazingly large maps. Great Visuals and Sound. Realistic. Definately not a run and gun game.
2511	1	a	great game, if you likfe military sim type games this is for you!
1991	1	a	The modifications are the best part of this game.  Had a good time on the  Reallife RPG  server and don't regret spending almost a week of my life there.
513	1	a	Probably the most realistic combat simulator for better or worse. A vast open island where you're all alone and an ambush could happen at any moment. Not a fast paced shooter at all and not meant to be.
3265	1	a	Currently my favourite game. Anyone looking for a realistic shooter needs to play this game. Also the modability makes it a game with unlimited options! Definitely check out all the mods that are out there. Worthy successor to the original Operation Flashpoint.
5125	0	a	This isn't a bad game, but it's not worth the price, and it's mostly a template for mods, and set in the future. If you want a true military experience, i would strongly reccomend arma 2 co, its worth the price, not this template.
5279	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game unreal how you always die and there is nothing to do
3954	1	a	One of the best games out there with countless mods to play and try and so many servers with different modes such as Altis life, Wasteland, Arma 3 Life, Exile, Epoch, etc. this game has it all if you are into Military Sims or just FPS's in general, you don't have to have the worlds best PC to run it but you do need at least an alright one, Ive played this game ever sense i got my PC and i can't say that there was a ever a dole moment with this game it just has so much things to do its a must buy.
2572	1	a	Arma 3, Where do i start?  Overall, A great game! Allthough the optimization is not too great, the mod support on this game is amazing, The campaign somehow makes sense and comes together, The new Go-Kart DLC is also great aswell!  
5168	0	a	After putting around 60 hours into this game i can not recommend it in its current form. The multiplayer performace is horrible at best. (~17fps at 8320 and a gtx970). The game still crashes randomly which resultet in complete profile losses. (So if you game crashes and you play a multiplayer mod with progression like altis or koth everything will be gone)   Overall i would say do not buy into this game unless you are willing to deal with an incredile amoutn of bugs/glitches and a performance which is on the same level as the slaughtering grounds.   DO NOT BUY IT
4179	0	a	Made me appreciate that DayZ isnt actually that bad
5159	0	a	horrible, trying to get a refund... waste of money
1355	1	a	battle royal is the best
1814	1	a	10/10 best arma 2 clone ever!
232	1	a	I like it, wish it was more popular
606	1	a	This a very fun and never boring game!
3135	1	a	It's a running simulator where AI can see through smoke, insta kill you when they are in a vehicle but when on foot they don't know how to hold a gun. And don't try to remember all the keybinds you just can't...
2707	1	a	Very adicting, realistic teambase military simulation, highly recommended! &lt;3
4058	1	a	by far the best game i have ever played yet keep up the good work
1359	1	a	Amazing Game, Lots Of money opertunitys if you get good at scripting&gt;.... Tons of server host looking for mission modders!
2855	1	a	This game is a must buy. I normally play wasteland and it the most fun ive had on the game. If you want to have a crazy experience play with the new apex update in the tanoa map.
900	1	a	I have almost 120 hours in this game and i still dont know half what it got to offer. it is simply the best game of 2013. if you is wondering wether or not to buy the game so buy it. the editor is the best way to experinece all the vehicles. play it as the game is ment to be played and you will enjoy it. if you are an battlefield or COD player dont buy this it is slow phased and you dont get you healt back after 5 seconds so buy it if you like slow phased and realistic games. this is the best way i can describe it. I have to go and play the game
309	1	a	ArmA III... Another timeless source of entertainment from Bohemia Interactive. Although it improves upon its predecessor - ArmA II / Operation Arrowehad - in many ways, there is definately room for improvement. While the game is more intensive on your hardware, especially CPU and GPU, for obvious reasons, the game does appear to be lacking a bit of optimisation. Saying that, it's not bad at all, and is perfectly playable. Players on a lower end PC may experience serious lag issues when playing large missions, especially during multiplayer.  ArmA 3 is a tactical shooter. Call of Duty or Battlefield fanboys go home. It is one of the most authentic combat simulators available to the public. It is not perfect, however. For what ArmA 3 lacks in realism and authenticity, it makes up for with a better physics engine, improved bullet ballistics, better graphics, ragdoll physics and an even bigger map. ArmA 3, like most of its Bohemia Interactive siblings, and many other games on the market, is a dish best served multiplayer. It's a very squad-based, team-work orientated warfare experience. You CAN go lone wolf rambo; there is nothing stopping you. However, you should be prepared to die very quickly and you may negatively impact both you and your teammates with your actions. In multiplayer, make sure you have all sectors covered and that you've got your teammates backs. Every squadmember is a vital asset, and if you screw up your whole team will pay the price. It's not about the points, it's about the mission. You cease to be a player; from the moment you join a server your mentality should be that you are a cog in the war machine. Be the best you can be; weigh your options, play tactically and, if you're lucky, you might 'Survive', 'Adapt' and 'Win'.  The AI is somewhat disappointing, can be extremely inconsistent. Sometimes you can run right past them and they will not notice you. Other times, they will detect and headshot you from 500m away, first shot, in the middle of the night and fog all around. This seems to have improved since the Alpha release of the game, however. The AI is often fairly consistent in its behaviour. They are not to be treated as the weak AI you might storm through in other games. While they often are incapable of matching the abilities of a skillful player, the AI an often deadly foe. Respect the AI, and try to put yourself in their shoes. While you may cry 'bull****!' when an AI kills you, were you the AI shooting at the player that is yourself, I am sure it not seem so ridiculous and their shots so impossibly accurate anymore. Stick to cover, stay calm and don't do anything stupid. Use your teammates to help you (or try... public servers can get messy). If you want to enjoy ArmA 3 to the fullest, I would definately suggest seeking out and joining a 'Realism Unit'. Realism units are player groups which emulate the battlefields of today (and even some which are chronologically seperate from today). There, you will hopefully find organised, structured, tactical and authentic gameplay. If, like most people, that is what brought you to the ArmA series, a Realism Unit is where you belong.  One thing ArmA has always had is a vast modding community, and fans are constantly producing and releasing more content. A modification I am particularly looking forward to is the Advanced Combat Environment (more commonly known as ACE2, the sequal to ACE for the original ArmA: Armed Assault game) mod for ArmA 3. In ArmA 2, which utilised a more realistic feeling, simulator-ish, yet more restrictive engine, I had a lot of fun with ACE. It adds lots of functionality and added realism, and helps to expand the world of Arma. The 'Authentic Gameplay Modification' (AGM) and Comabt Space Enhancement (CSE) were two realism mods which expanded the gameplay significantly, which have since been discontinued. Their teams have merged, along with some of the developers from ACE2, to develop the recently announced ACE3. As of your reading this, ACE3 is probably already released and one of the most widely used mods in the ArmA III modding scene.  Perhaps one of the most appealing aspects of the ArmA series, and one that gives it such longevity and popularity, would be the powerful mission editor tools. On the Steam Workshop, and several other online websites, you can find both Singleplayer and Multiplayer community-made missions with varying difficulties and talent. The ALiVE mod for ArmA 3 allows mission makers to easily build large-scale, dynamic, evolving missions utilising procedural generation, helping to flesh out the ArmA experience.  I am excited to see what ArmA IV will bring to the table, if Bohemia Interactive decide to create a fourth installment in the series. They probably will, and I do think the first thing they will need to work on if they want to have a snowball's chance in hell of selling an ArmA 4, would be the AI. It isn't bad, but it is far from good and needs some massive improvement.
1771	1	a	Great :)
2661	1	a	Arma III is a combat simulator like no other simulator I've played. I like the deep mental involvement. Very immersive game.
1455	1	a	Best and most realistic Military Simulator. I died so many times so i quit. But its fun and i am a newbie
2980	1	a	-Buys awesome Nazi camo chinook. -Press Ctrl+Left shift+P To purchase the DLC to use this. â¥â¥â¥â¥ that.  -Buys a sweet Marksman Rifle to kill everyone. -Press Ctrl+Left shift+P To purchase the DLC to use this.  -Sees a gokart. -Press Ctrl+Left shift+P To purchase the DLC to use this.  Kills self.
252	1	a	One of the best simulation Game great ambient so immersive &amp; the other Mod just special i recomanded Battle Royal , you need absolutly try this mod incredible experiences..
5103	0	a	I had really high hopes for this game when I was told about it. But I can officially warn you that this game is piece of sh*t. The only functional part of the game is the uninstall option. The physics are none existent and the animations are about as smooth as a man in a wheelchair trying to climb a spiral staircase. Not only that, but the people who play the game are tight f*cks who couldn't make it in the army so they play Arma 3.  There is one positive aspect to this game however, and that is joining high pop servers and team killing all of unbelievably sweaty players who all seem to be consecutively on their periods. It makes DayZ look amazing. D*ckhead simulator 2015
5376	1	a	Very nice game i played arma 2 and arma 2 operation arrowhead and they have step it up really nicely the multiplayer server engines could be a bit better but apart from that it's a masterpiece of Fps games.
2809	1	a	Well Arma.. is it good or not? I think the Arma(s) are great because of the community. Arma III is here with us since 2013 and it has changed a lot. When it first saw the Sun light it was buggy and badly optimized. I know. I was there at the begining (not with this acc.). After a time it started changing in a good way. Many new things have come: updates, fps improvment, bipods!, mods. Mods changed my way of thinking about Arma III. I used to be pessimistic and I didn't play a lot with it. But as these things came I started beleiving Arma III is good, it's getting better. I started using many mods, tons of maps and so on. Arma III is a great game so as Arma II. The main issue with this game is the people who can't see that this is not a COD or a BF. There are people out there crying about the realism of the game. I think this is the main reason why many people play it: the realism. It's great playing for hours in a milsim or in a CTI game. I can only recommend this game for people who loves these kind of games. It's not that expensive as it used to be, but I highly recommend firstly download this game from a website, try out if it's working and after that buying it. +thing: the camera mode. It's a great fun for people who are take shots with there camera in real life.
727	1	a	It's like skyrim, with horrible controls!
225	1	a	After playing many hours on  ArmA III , from a realistic perspective and a fun one; it is a great experience for anyone who loves  military simulators  [en.wikipedia.org] . The game is divded into several categories if you will: Infantry, Airborne, Waterborne, Artillery, Armoured, Mechanized and HQ - it covers all of the basics (plus advanced) on the battlefield allowing for a varied approach to the game itself. Personally, I prefer being behind a console managing UAVs/UGVs! The successor of ArmA II has certainly taken on the role of 'NEXTGEN' and demolished competition such as America's Army and DCS World.  The  RV4 Engine  [arma3.com]  is used for DayZ Standalone and ArmA 3 thus far. Though DayZ developers have recently announced the change of their [heavily] modified engine, it really brings the ambience and full graphical effect of ArmA III to life. The detail of graphical texturing is one thing that appealed to me the most. In the majority of games I have experienced during my past, graphical texturing has always been a problem in games such as Call of Duty, (some) Battlefield games and even ArmA II. The level of immersion when experiencing the fidelity of ArmA III is insanely good.  Pros: Â» Detailed, well researched factions which integrate with some fictional factors: CSAT, NATO, FIA, Guerillas and even civilians. Â» Realistic sound effects for particular weapons, majority of them being rifles and pistols. Â» Ability to perform one of many roles: armour, infantry, etcetera. Â» Well established storyline for the campaign: even split into acts for more development time. Â» Realistic factors such as the attention to detail on the IFV-6c Panther - when moving over rough terrain, there are flaps on the side of the tracks that raise as it would interact with the physics in the world. Excellent detail! Â» Generally great game to play. Â» ...Many, many more.  Cons: Â» Ladders are extremely buggy. Climbing thin air is a thing once at the top of the ladder. Â» Artificial Intelligence needs a rework. Their reactions are not quick enough and are heavily delayed when reacting. Earlier today I told my men to hold fire yet they continued, even when disengaged. Â» No built-in immersive radios. External mods required: Task Force Arrowhead Radio, ACRE, etcetera. Â» Although one of the factions are based on NATO, it is all American equipment and characters - voice acting is American for example. Â» Editing a custom mission is impossible unless you have external modifications. Â» Animations in general could do with a bit of a rework.  Overall, I would rate the game about 8/10 simply based on my hours within ArmA III. I played the alpha and the beta and it has come a long way since. It was great to be a part of that development process and I am glad I bought the game early. Really excellent game! I love it!
847	1	a	I'm not going to say, BUY THIS GAME!! because it's not for everyone, if you like ARMA 2 or military, FPS shooters (not COD, thats more like an arcade game) then yeah this game is awesome and is a leader in that market. If you think this game is full on, arcade style action packs bullets,bombs and metal flying all over the place, it's not, but it's just as fun as one of those games.
3583	1	a	I have played over 100+ hours and this is my favourite game off all time.  Like when i play Altis:  1) Go up to an ATM take out all your money 2) Go buy a car 3) Drive to the Gun Store (takes million year to drive) 4) Buy license and gun 5) Drive down to kaval again  6) get robbed 7) cops drive pass  8) loss you gun  10/10  Get this game
4002	1	a	I have played this game for a long time and have also played arma 2. I would call this game one of the best games out there. There is so many things that you can do that it just does not end.    If you are looking for a new game to buy I would say Arma 3 is a great chose.
4531	1	a	If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if you're looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.  Ingredients: 1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie   Directions: 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.
5397	0	a	I thought this game was AMAZIING at first, since I has seen videos on Youtube, but then when I got into the game, I realized that it was a rip off for SIXTY DOLLARS! The game is very realistic, but maybe a bit TOO realistic. You get tired like every five seconds in the game so you cant sprint for a very long time, which makes the game boring, because it takes forever to get anywhere. The game is also very hard to understand at first, and the turorial is very confusing when you start. If you are buying this game for graphics or/and realism, then its a yes, but if you are buying this game for fun and lots of action, you should pass on this one.
3718	1	a	Good game with friends, very moddable, if you like a game with variying pace this is for you.
2770	1	a	That how Arma gose . in the first 24 hours you dont know what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ you doing i\or how to move and try to jump. aftar the 24 hrs you releas you cant jump but you can use  with all the cars hllicopter and more i have 1300Hrs on the game and i am still learning . good luck ,  10/10
683	1	a	i want to â¥â¥â¥â¥ karel moricky he has a very sexy voice dlc sucks though
4747	1	a	This is a realistic shooter, with teamwork and everything. At some points you can be so immersed into this game that you think you are a real soldier that is fighting in a war. I also think this is a game that people would say 'Buy this game for me' to their friends or family for the holidays.
3268	1	a	This game is unvelievebly fun! I have spent nearly 1,500 hours playing ArmA 3, thousands of servers are available for a range of user-made game modes.  BI has done a great job with the development tools available for ArmA 3 as well as the fully-accessable wiki which provides all of the commands for scripters and developers, they've given the user thousands of ways of developing their own gamemodes, mods, maps, anything.  I would highly reccomend this game to anyone into FPS and 3rd Person Shooters, the userability in this game is outstanding.  (p.s - if you join a server and its laggy, its not ArmA 3, its most commonly your graphics settings (this game is CPU heavy) or its caused by bad optimization of the mission which has most probably been user-made)  
5017	1	a	its cool
5018	1	a	There is just so much to do in the ARMA series that if you're a fan of first person shooters, there really is no reason not to have this simulation in your library. I may be a little bias since I've loved the ARMA series since the very early days of ARMA 2, but there is also very little not to love in any ARMA simulation. If the base game just isn't enough for you, there's also a few hundred mods you can install to make the experience funner and more immersive. I would recommend ARMA 3 to everyone, there is so many different roles to play offline and online it'd be hard for you to not be able to enjoy the sim and have some fun.
1014	1	a	This game/simulator is amazing. You can see all the hardwork that went into creating it. I have been an ARMA Fan since the beginning and enjoy seeing how far it has come.
5367	0	a	They should really fix this game performace wise, performs like one of the first AAA games that were demanding on PC. Cant say i can recommend it due to all the performance issues, and i run 2x 970 STRIX in SLI and got a high end Intel CPU, and even with those startup commands it doesnt fix much.
4161	1	a	Played Altis Life. Started a gang known as the Notorious Paint Men. We terrorised the streets of Atlis Striking fear into those who sell paint by robbing them. We soon got investgated by the police and in order to save my friends and I, I proceeded to seduce the officer using Marvin Gaye's Let Get it On. It went well as he then restrained me and then strip searched me. Due to my guilt I was forced to tell the officer that I was the leader of the Paint Men. Fortunately I was able to escape his clutches. The crew then jumped out of the bushes and sprayed him down with there machine guns. In our escape i ran into a rock then got launched 500 meters into the air and fell to my death. 10/10 good â¥â¥â¥â¥.
2621	1	a	I just think this game is the defenition of best gunplay in arma. It has a mixture of realistic gun actions and (if you like to ruin the game) you can flay it like a twitch shooter.
787	1	a	Very interesting choice, I love it, this is my favorite multiplayer game. I play in a Milsim unit and have led them before too. It is best with a group of people; seeing as it is a military simulator this would make sense. I enjoy it very much and my favorite role is to be a pilot. If you are a casual then you can play on vannilla and there are plenty of those. If you are into a little more of a challenge than you may want to go in to Tactical realism or MilSim. It is very fun but can be demanding on your computer, also it has a few glitches and may seem expensive. The choice is up to you. Odds are that you PROBABLY would have already gotten the idea of what the game is like from the preview. This is one of those games where if you are interested you will probably like it, but don't pass it down if you are curious.   -Message me if you are wanting to join a Milsim Unit.   Have fun! Worth the price!
2811	1	a	Check out my Friend's review who is the best Arma player I have ever seen or known, I cant explain it better than him. Steam name: Divercsip
1045	1	a	One of the best games you could possibly play with a good pc. Almost infinite possibilities.
3081	1	a	Bought Arma 3 a few days ago,and now this 50% off while I bought full price RIP.
4769	1	a	Better than ninja Gaidon on hardmode
1559	0	a	This game serves as a textbook example of why graphics are not more important than mechanics. Any game that has to be modded to achieve a basic level of playability is a failed project by any measure. If you just was a mission editor or multiplayer, that's fine. But to not buy this for the campaign. You will spend nealry half of your playtime loading from a save after dying because of something completely out of your control. For example, I spent the past hour doing just that after my team would not follow a simple 'move' command and an enemy MRAP nearly a kilometer out spotted us, and killed all of us with two salvos from it's HMG. Spend your $60 on something better if you're looking for a single-player experience.
2448	1	a	This game is a whole new meaning of Awesome. The succesor of the very fun Arma 2, Arma 3 is beautiful and lively yet at the same time can become a giant battlefield of fun and thats why i love this game. If this hasn't convinced you to get this amazing game, well you're missing out.
5246	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS ABISMAL ATTEMPT AT A GAME! It is by far the buggiest, crappiest attempt at a game ive ever come across, theres pre-release software on steam that works better, you have been warned!
4354	1	a	Travis Scott's newest album really dosn't stay true to his original style and has more of a Hip-Pop feel than Hip-Hop
867	1	a	I played the alpha sadly. there was too many bugs. so I disliked it and kept staying at arma 2. after arma 2's shutdown and all the stuff arma 2 oa and arma 2 got I've got my hands on arma 3 a bit. I liked the game. I would like to buy it too
3604	1	a	So I got the Exile Mod installed and ran about 1 hour around Esseker looking for supplies. I see a guy around a hospital and he looks unarmed, just like me. I ran to him and we started talking. Soon after I was handcuffed and naked in the open. He sayed he'd comeback with something to free me. 'Well, this is all I've got' - he says. Gets executed.  11/10 would socialize in a harsh apocaliptic wasteland again
2978	1	a	This game is great, however you should get it with friends or join a clan right away.
4572	1	a	Only game I really play on steam now. Highly recommend getting it if you like realism in games
3365	1	a	Arma 3 is an awesome, intense and realistic shooter ( besides the fact that you run for 10 seconds and then your character starts to waddle around)  8/10
757	1	a	+ wide military realism gameplay experience + great graphics + moddable contets and huge community  - currently issues with slow servers(some lagging = low FPS just like in A2) - big HW requirements
40	1	a	Long time AOE fan. This is my favorite of the series, because they took out so much of the tedious micro managing out of the game. The cards 'shipments' is a fun aspect too. Awesome multiplayer. My fav. strategy game ever.
4605	1	a	u shuut guns and fly helicopters wich is fun bt hard i giv this gaim 10/10
1774	1	a	Played Tutorial- Realized game was very realistic  Played Beginning of Campaign- Had lots of fun  Joined A Co-Op Server 'Terrorist Hunt'- Got team-Killed two times at spawn.  10/10 Experience Very Realistic
5047	0	a	Awesome graphics and plot but game's playability is very low. Controls are very hard to use. You can not change them in the way you choose. It is the worst game I ever played for 4-5 years. Really annoying just because of controls. There are universal keys like 'T' for chat or 'Y' for team chat, they are totally different. And another problem is that Bohemia uses the same strategy for their other products like DayZ. Another not recommended game for me.
5048	0	a	I realize the Army's unofficial slogan is hurry up and wait. I didn't think developers would create a game completely embodying that statement.  I have never been so bored trying to play a game before. Keyword, trying, as once you actually get to the combat area (15-20 minutes after loading up this un-optimized mess) you get shot and have to redo the same process again.  0/10   Would not wait in a Humvee again.
822	1	a	The Best Millitary Game Now-Days !!
803	1	a	This game... Well, the story is: if you hope for a campaign, it's here, but it is one of the worst i've played - after 5 hours of a 'meh' 1st campaign, comes the second one, where a greek insurgent has a terrible accent... polish, to be exact (no racism against poles, i am one, and our accent does sound awful). But the multiplayer - as addictive as it can get. Good balance when it comes to co-op - it always is a challenge to beat the ai. Though it does obviously have some bugs, sometimes. Pros: - Fresh and new compared to BF and CoD... and in my opinion somehow better than both. - Quite good graphics - A nice choice of weapons in MP... though there could be more - A LOT of creativity from the devs - Finally, a truly team-based FPS - A lot of customisability for your character - though it's not Rainbow Six Vegas 2 level of it. Cons: - The campaign is crap - enemies hitting you from impossible angles, a pretty bad story... though better than CoD:G - Even if you have a beastly PC, there will be a frame rate drop when driving in vehicles if you have you view distance too high (as infantry, i use 8000 m, i have to use 1200 in vehicles) - Bugs bugs bugs... Though the devs patched a lot of them already. Overally, the game is a 9/10. It would be a 10/10 if the campaign was a tad better, and if not for bugs which actually hurt the gameplay (sinking into a pier when trying to climb it) it would be definitely the best FPS on the market. It is the best when it comes to team play and realism though. Definitly recommend.
950	1	a	I have 1.3k hr's in game all I can say this game is epic. Find a group of friend's and jump in the combat of this game is the best I have ever been in. My fave game mode's are Wasteland and Altis life (Join the servers some time as well come hang with us and have fun on arma if you have no one else. Fractured Wasteland, Darkside Altis Life) Enjoy have fun and shoot loads of people. :P
3667	1	a	For Â£44. I've expected more, But the workshop items make up for it.
3593	1	a	Best Military Simulator with plenty of mods and a huge RP community.
4656	1	a	10 Kart DLC advertisements out of 10.
3287	1	a	Desync is real, get swallowed by metal fence's and brick walls and rocks resulting in death .......
4534	1	a	it is a lote of fun i hilly recomend this game
2581	1	a	This is the most realistic game I have ever played. Controls are hard to adjust to but if you like military simulators you will love this game 10.5/10
4204	0	a	High price low fps, overall bad game
923	1	a	It's good â¥â¥â¥â¥ buy it
4382	1	a	Russian tested, Putin approved. Needs more Russian mods though.
1812	1	a	Awesome game and awesome graphics and if u got a normal pc you can still play it on realtime fps! i got a pretty bad pc and i got 25-30 fps on normal graphics!!! if you like military games this is recommended!
4884	1	a	This game is one that is either love it or hate it in regards to the original, unmodded game and it's concept. It's realistic and while people call it a 'running simulator' in real gameplay modes unlike Wasteland where you start with a good set of military assets, you only have to run for long distances unless you wrecked 4 vehicles and don't have friends in a squad to pick you up or to respawn on.   Here is the easiest way to explain the concpet of this game, look at a game where you fight in a plane, stuff like Star Fox and Crimson ties are arcadey, gamey takes on this, then there are combat flight sims that are in-depth, thoughtful, and inforgiving as well as realsitic as hell. This game is basically the flight simualtor approach to the concept of a Battlefield game, where military infantry, land, sea, and air units fight in a very large environment with a lot of units at once in a game session. Except this has very in-depth coop and singleplayer unlike Battlefield.   It's not for everyone, but for those who always wanted there sooter game's guns and vehicles to feel more realsitic, who wanted strategy, tactics, and thoughtful choice of action to be more important than in arcadey military shooters, and who wanted a military experience over a hollywood, michael bay interpretatino of a military experience like in CoD and BF. This is the game for you.   Developer support is great, new DLC and patches that actually help are regular occurences.  Mod support is arguably the best in all of gaming, offering anything from new experiences like zombie survival to post apocalyptic warfare to doubling and greatly expanding the amount of guns, vehicles, units, and gameplay mechanics available all for free through playermade content heavily supported by the developer, a modding contest with a large pool of prize money is even comnfirmed by the dev.   9/10  Some tips for potential buyers:  -If you are new to Arma, play the 'bootcamp' campaign first, that gives you a tutorial to teach it's unique and pretty complex mechanics and controls, this will make it much easier and less frustrating to learn.  -Never use Vsync in the in-game menu, it causes frame drops and sluggishness, adaptive Vsync via gpu driver software may be a better option  -Never put view distance over 2500 meters, most mp servers lock it too 1600 meters maximum anyway (and override your settings) and anything longer distance than 2500 is not optimized and is meant to be enjoyed by future machines who easily overpower the game.  -For specs, 8+ gb of DDR3 RAM and a modern CPU with a high clock speed is most important, you only need a mid grade video card to run things on high and medium with a distance below 2500 and vsync off, and having more than 4 cores in a CPU matters very little, but clock speed does, I'd say at least 3.5 Ghz for over 30fps.  -Don't expect to fully understand or master the game anytime soon and expect to be challenged a lot, if you do so, you'll get a rewarding experience that others wanting instant gratification (which is fine, but just not what Arma is good at) may find frustrating.  Hope this helps, as an Arma maniac I want to steer peopel who won't like this game away from buying it as much as I want people who would like it to put their money down.
4173	1	a	You can shoot rabbits. 12341234/10
1646	1	a	Probably one of the best milsim game ever. The mod community makes it even better. I recommed this to anyone who thinks call of duty is a game for kids and wants a real challenge.
2470	1	a	I give this game a 10/10 I have 400 Hours on this game 350 of those hours I've played. Other 50 hours went to AFKing. It's well worth the money becasue you can use mods on it and run different missions the re-playableity is endless. Now I only played wasteland, but there is more things like Life and stuff. Now I have played Arma: 2 Free so I know how to play the game. Only thing I don't like about it is the lack of firearms, cars, Helis, and Planes. If you look past that though it's a great game over all. It's quite social.
648	1	a	Amazing Game, then I found Breaking Point and was blown away even more... worth the buy!
1604	1	a	Definitely worth the cash. It may have its problems, but the pros heavily outweight the cons. I love the realistic gameplay, and I have had a blast playing this game. Enjoy FPS games? Looking for realism? You can't go wrong with purchasing this game.  10/10
5238	0	a	Good Game. Game Good. Price-Not good. Dont buy it yet.
2295	1	a	This game is 10/10, I love it. Definatly a big step from ArmA II 
1722	1	a	10.0  Pros: -An insane amount of high quality, super fun, multiplayer mods -Simulation style in all aspects -Pretty graphics -Super customizable from head to toe -Once you grasp it, it's â¥â¥â¥â¥ing awesome -Breaking Point (mod) -Altis Life RPG (mod)  Cons: -LOTS of controls to work with -Not your average shooter; steep learning curve
2377	1	a	Arma 3 is a very fun, open world game. It has an extremely large modding community, and is widely played by those throughout the world. It contains a scenario editor in which you can create your own missions for you and/or others to play together. It has a unique scripting lanuage, which is difficult to learn at the beginning, but is very flexible once you learn it. The community has much variation, from player age, experience, heritage, etc. and is a great game for those who really like Combat/Strategy.
882	1	a	Very Good gameplay and great mechanics, a tad poorly optimised but runs okay and highly playable. I Dont have a bad rig (HD 7990, FX 8350, Sabertooth 990FX R2.0 and 16 GB ram) but cant run any better than high with just 4xMSAA. be nice to run on ultra with 8 on this card as it is definately capable
3976	1	a	Ok so the bottom line is, this is not just a shooter, its not just a multiplayer shooter similar to the likes of Black ops 2, AW or anything like that, it is as close to a military simulator. I love KOTH(King of the Hill) great game &amp; can be played as alone wolf or with friends. I have to give this 11/10
4904	1	a	Now, with almost 700 hours on Arma i would say that this game has so much replay value to it. Arma 3 is a Army Shooter Simulation. The campaign is excellent, including all addons and mods on the steam workshop are FREE and Arma releases their OWN addons. Overall, its a great game all around where you can use teamwork, play against each other competitivly, or join a unit to get the full experience of a Military Suimultion out of Arma. At it's current stage i recommend this 100% Great Buy :D
3042	1	a	It isn't a war unless there is a road march.
824	1	a	Arma 3 is definatly easily my favorite game of all time, it produced an unforgetable experience, it showed stunning visual gamplay along with a brilliant engine that works very well with the game, It has a massive selection of weapons and vehicles. The community of Arma 3 is amazingly massive, there are tons of gamemodes and servers just waiting to be played on. It comes with a campaign that is entertaining and well developed. It also has a gigantic workshop community with new weapon skins, vehicles and all sorts being added each day. This game is simply fantastic and well worth every penny.   10/10
507	1	a	Best game for coop.
519	1	a	I guess it's kinda good
3653	1	a	Although performance, gameplay and graphics are still not the best, Arma 3 is one of the best strategic and realistic shooter on the market.  Its mod support and community offer a decent amount of game modes, scenarios and other cool stuff, giving you the oportunity to play not just a shooter, but also an amazing role play game, a depressing post apocalypse survival game, the most realistic military simulation so far and many other cool things brought to you by the community or Bohemia itself!  If you like strategic or realistic shooter Arma 3 is a must have! Just go sure and check the system requirements before buying... ;)
2743	1	a	Rocks still screw up your life 10/10 would run at 10fps again Get it Rocks won't dissipoint you 
4621	1	a	Like it's predecessor, Arma 3 really raises the bar in the gaming industry. Graphics, Beautiful... Physics, Fluid... Gameplay... Enagaging... You won't find a shooter like it! The number of mods is growing rapidly, and that's what really makes the Arma series what they are today. As with Arma 2, you are purchasing a game, with many separate games embedded for mulitplayer, or singleplayer.  Due to the fact that this game is full release, there are no major issues, and it's only recently been available! However I would recommend waiting for a sale or buying this game elsewhere, as I do think Â£40 is a little steep, atleast for me.
4712	1	a	it is realy fun i recommend buying it there are mods like wasteland and altis life those are really fun
1691	1	a	10/10 would play again. MLG many mods.
3783	1	a	idk what im doing 13/10
3567	1	a	Great game that offers many different game modes for all the hardcore and softcore gamers. It is much more fun to play with a group of friends since you will be up against majority of the time groups.
2610	1	a	this is a great game
981	1	a	An incredible creation for those with right tools, I strongly suggest the use of a mid-high end CPU as well as at least 8GB of RAM at a half decent speed/latancy (This game is heavily CPU intensive but does not really take advantage of high end GPUs) Without the right hardware my friend, you are in for a hard time when it comes to smooth gameplay with higher textures. The thing to take away from this is make sure your system is in order to avoid disapointment.  Speaking of gameplay, ARMA 3 is a massively satisfying game to master and the enjoyment and immersion levels are second to none. The campaign (whilst not on the same levels as ARMA 2's Harvest Red) is a great experience with a relatively good story line and very tactical gameplay.  Multiplayer- The possibilities are endless, Altis Life, Wasteland, Warfare, MILSIM, Deathmatch, Exile... The list goes on and then some if you bring mods into the equation. ARMA 3's multiplayer experience is definitely centred on the community aspect, which I love dearly.  Pros: -Active modding community -Great graphics/attention to detail -Engaging and exciting storyline with memorable characters -Immensely satisfying gameplay offline or online  Cons: -Consider investing in a high end CPU -Pricey DLCs (They gotta keep the bandwagon moving somehow bare in mind) -Of course there's bugs for christ's sake, stop climbing up sheer rocks or playing on dev branch!  Overall I really do reccomend ARMA3 to the military enthusiast to the casual FPS gamer:) Enjoy.
5242	0	a	SP or anything that isnt a mod is a no go, wish i could have given my cash to a few mod devs instead! If you do have it you should definately get the Breaking Point mod, plays better than the rest of the game.  *Update as of 1/13/15* Still a better flight sim than a tactical shooter by far...
3572	1	a	My character has PTSD now     Shellshock/11
297	1	a	Great game just please keep adding more vehicles :D &lt;3 &lt;3 
1587	1	a	Extremely realistic and fun milsim mmo. Reccomend for anyone who likes, well, games!
2989	1	a	it would have been my most played game if I haden't got global banned for getting my cd stolen. I still recommend it though. Lots of fun!
3595	1	a	Very good game with horrible optimalization (may be caused by my laptop). I love this game even when I have low fps. Best part of this game begins, when you mod it!
5315	1	a	its a great game if you like tactical gameplay
1043	1	a	Arma 3 is a military simulator with 2 islands as the setting, Stratis and Altis, based off of Greek Islands in the Mediterranean. The campaign focuses on the time period of 2035 and follows Kerry, a soldier in NATO stationed in Stratis. Personally I have only gotten halfway through the 3 episode campaign (2nd episode) Arma 3 is much more beautiful and it's obvious a lot of work has been put into graphical detail, though this hindered other key things such as vehicles (Arma 2 has so much more!)   Pros: Looks truly amazing Much higher FPS than Arma 2 Great campaign Clothing choices Mods are easier to get (Steam workshop) Virtual Arsenal allows you to gear up your character for anything and saves a lot of time making your character manually. Crazy stuff is possible even though it's a simulator 3D editor will be coming in the first quarter of 2016 allowing for more scenarios to be made with little to no difficulty (maybe more work though)  Editor allows for many different scenarios such as demolition, sniping, etc DLC content is included in base game though has an annoying ad if not purchased Cons: Editor can still be confusing and scripts are easy to forget Less content than I would have expected though there are attachments for weapons which satisfies those who want high customizability Getting the original maps like Chernarus and Sahrani are in AiA and can be a more complicated process to get than for most Some things seen in game are so unrealistic, see how the hunter will take airtime  In conclusion, Arma 3 is a great game with more content coming and it's easy to get many many hours into the game. Anything is possible and it reminds me of a gmod with military focus. There's tons of potential and I recommend it for anyone who can run it 
3765	1	a	Great game
3244	1	a	Ill write a review later I'm busy playing Arma 3!
4349	1	a	Flying boats and many glitches i give it 9/11 Allahu akbar
1042	1	a	This game is really what you make of it, So far playing lots of Takistan Life and Exile I can highly reccomend this game. It really is an amazing and unique experience. Youll see thing you wont see in any other games! If you want bad â¥â¥â¥ firefights. Explosions, Car Chases, Or just amazingly cool moments overall then buy this game!
3690	1	a	Best game for realism shooters! Not even compared to Battlefield. I loved playing the campaign and I love playing multiplayer! Just joined to a milsim unit and every week I do at least 3 drills.
1461	1	a	It's a game.
2140	1	a	is game is fun and good to do team work with the people around you I honestly think this game is very fun and very stressful to being against other players. But this game is always encouraging other players and makes everyone do teamwork. Causing the situation to be fun and more active .+1
3851	1	a	Good war simulator. Has some glitches.
4338	1	a	-Logs into Arma  -Goes on Altis Life  -Speeds and gets pulled over  -cop asks 'why were you speeding'?  -Replies 'Cuz i couldn't wait to see you' ;)   10/10 would speed again
1333	1	a	Absolutely amazing! Now, you will ned a beefy computer to play with graphics that are decent and a framerate that is above 30 FPS, but even on a laptop running it at 20 FPS with the lowest graphics possible, its still HELLA fun to play. One of the best military simulators out on the market.

1307	1	a	This game is awesome love altis life the most :)
1185	1	a	Get this game! It's amazing!
4301	1	a	Good Game, Hours of fun and hilarious times in multiplayer
260	1	a	This game offers a lot. And I mean A LOT. You can download endless missions made from the community workshop and play with strategy with your friends or run around half naked and dance around. Or you could roleplay and buy an ATM from all the drug money you earned in Altis Life. Or have races with friends in Karts. This game is an Army Simulator, but it's great for modding which let's you do more things.  Now, this game isn't something like COD or Battlefield, it takes strategy and tactics and patience. If you come from these games it will be harder to get into fast. Although if you play through the campaign it will help you get used to the game. Please don't think the warfare in this game is just pew pew pew, die, respawn, repeat. It takes skill.  Altis is a very big map, you can drive around for what seems like forever in this beautiful map. There is forestry, a lot of ocean, desert, grassland, etc. There is also Stratis, a smaller, more wastelandish and deserty than Altis.   You need a good PC to run this game. I usually get around 45 fps on online servers, around 60 on single player or games with small amounts of people in it.  Overall, this game has a ton of things to do and you can't get bored of it. I give it a 9.5/10
100	1	a	our great openworld moddable tactical sim-a-like military game ...  and we want to make it even better and more awesome ;)
1772	1	a	If you are into mil sims you should definitely check this out!
1108	1	a	one of the best games ever.  u need time to learn how to play and more to master.  the best mods are wasteland and altis life and its keep updating by community.  there's more mods like breaking point and epoch wich is like dayz.   9/10
4700	1	a	The best tactic game i ever known and such good grahpics and such smooth gameplay i rate 10/10 also no lag at all
1819	1	a	Totally worth the 60 bucks, got it over the summer and I already have 505h logged, #nolife, extremlly fun though and the community is awesome!  You don't need the DLC's to enjoy the game, but if you really think you'll need them buy them when they are on sale.  
3726	1	a	Very cool game. Lots of MODs.
190	1	a	Made an enemy outpost as Zeus when my friends were riding along the road. They did not suspect a thing. God bless America.
1876	1	a	This game is incredible and what makes it so good, is the variety of ways you can play it alongside the amazing levels of customization   Want to play a  Mil-Sim ? Arma 3 has your back, with Land, Sea, and Air combat options. Stay frosty. Want to play an  Open World Zombie Survival ? Arma 3 Breaking Point has you wondering who to trust, and who to kill over a can of beans. Want to play a  City/Island Life RolePlay  as a Police Officer, Drug Dealer, or various other occupations? Arma 3's gotchu  This only scratches the surface of this games vast communities, but you get the point. The game's players are dedicated and very productive when it comes to making mods, and that's because Bohemia Interactive ALLOWS FULL ACCESS for players to do so, knowing that the players know what they want, and know how to create and tailor it best, while they improve the core game's functionality. This full access has also led to many scripts and 'hax' being made, but their Anti-Cheat has evolved to counter most, if not all, in the recent years. Even if it doesn't catch one, it's incredibly likely that an Admin in your selected community will handle the problem himself.  Having dumped hundreds of hours into both ARMA 2 and ARMA 3, and taking party in many of the mods made by the community, I can confidently say that these are my favorite games and  I would absolutley recommend this game to any friend or fellow gamer.  The games go on sale very often so if you want to save a few moneybucks, you can wait for those, otherwise I encourage any and all to become part of this game and join one of the many communities within it.

4763	1	a	I wish this would go on sale already so I can murder my friends like I've always wanted to
571	1	a	Good    -Realistic (compared to cod or bf) -Fun with friends  -Tons of gamemodes  -Good graphics -Plenty of mods    Bad  -Overpriced DLC -Low fps (aka the game is not optimised) -Probably too difficult for new players to understand how to play
3421	1	a	whats the diffrence between buying normal arma 3 and buying arma 3 digital deluxe edition because it seems you pay for 5 euro's more for absolutly nothing.........
1231	1	a	(TL;DR IS AT THE BOTTOM)  ahh who remembers good old Operation Flashpoint. Not that crap modern sheit, but BI's Operation Flashpoint. There are some that don't know that Arma is it's direct ancestor btw. Anyways when I was young (too young for the game ill bet oooo edgy) i sank a good few thousand hours into OFP Cold War Crisis and its expansions. Eventually i played Arma 2. i wasn't really very impressed due to the crashes and the actual graphical look of the game was horrible. Some sorta film grain gone wrong  Then the recent free weekend rolled around for Arma 3. I was so impressed that i had to buy myself a Â£95 headset - and that was the cheapest price for it. I'd probably have a few more 10s of hours in the game, but its the studying time of the year. But this game. Sure it has a weird looking stealth-inspired vehicles, but its Arma. It's moddable, and BI encourage you to mod, unlike almost every other company. That means you get things like Iron Front (an Arma 2 mod turned into a full game turned into an Arma 3 mod, confusing i know) that features WWII campaigns with maps and units to play with in the editor. It means you get JSRS, a sound mod that changes so many sounds in the game - the one i notice the most is the jets. the jets sound real, and when you wear a surround sound headset or have surround speakers, it sounds real. makes me feel like i'm in the Lake District for some reason. (the RAF does training there).  and then theres the multiplayer. i'm not even going to go further than saying the best servers are the 77th JSOC co-op EU1 and EU2. unless youre murican. if youre murican, you lag. go away. if youre a kid, dont even touch my favourite servers. if youre looking for a group that actually plays together as a team, go no further than the 77th. the rest of the co-op servers cant actually work co-op if they got paid to do it. idk even know why im writing a review i just wanted to tell you about the best server on arma. and that altislife sheeit is for kids who shouldnt even be playing the game. you want to roleplay go play â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ gmod  anyway everyone tells a funny story so this one time on 77th its late night irl, its dark ingame too. barely anyone is online. so im leading a squad, and we are driving from the airport to the AO south east of pygros in a HEMTT transport. it takes so long the squad in the back starts shooting rabbits from the back and talking about stuff soldiers talk about, idk. half an hour later, literally, we are nearly there. i cant see the AO, but its just over a hill in front of us. then theres a sound... and then another sound, like a rocket. so yeah a jet comes out of nowhere. entire squad leaves and im left on my own in base.  10/10 tl;dr  OFP CWC is Arma, Arma 2 had a bad film grain effect, Arma 3 free weekend, got headphones, mods like Iron Front and JSRS, RAF does training in the Lake District, 77th JSOC owns the best 2 servers in the game - americans and squeekers stay out, altislife is for kids that should go back to gmod, and finally i drive a HEMTT transport full of soldiers to their death by jet.  Arma 3, 10/10 not IGN (has enough water)
3781	1	a	you know, i was originally on the fence about how i felt about games like arma i never really cared for them outside of using them to play dayz holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥ what a waste of time it was to use them for that and that only only recently have i begun playing more arma and less dayz  then i wanted arma 3, almost bought it for full price, got it for 40 bucks the next day AND got the rest of the expansions for arma 2 these are actually really fun games 
441	1	a	Dear Players,  This game is absolute monster among other ones. It's superb for everyone who loves coop and open world and, moreover, it's the only game where I've found so vast and proactive modding community, I'm really amazed.  I've played Altis Life(mostly) and on private server with guys from national coop communities, I met so many fantastic people and I can't say a bad word about this game, that's for sure.  Go, give it a shot!
2114	1	a	I don't own this game, but it's letting me write a review so I've researched the game and here's what I think:  You want realism? Play this game. There are a lot of poses you can get into, accurate star maps, accurate shooting physics, and way more. Overall a great game if you like realism.
3963	1	a	This game is worth every cent. It is extremely realistic and has provided hours of fun for me and my friends.
5383	1	a	Great game :D
4781	1	a	10/10 player once liked it
94	1	a	I rarely rate a game this high, but this one is a perfect 10/10 for the genre it represents vs. any competitive products out there.  Bar none, the BEST military simulation on the PC that is available to the public and priced under $10000  Yes there are flight sims that do flight more realistic, there are tank sims that do tanks more realistic, etc, etc, etc. However, there are no other games that combine ALL the aspects of a military simulation in one full package like the Arma series does.  Arma III is the continuation of the Arma series, which started out as 'Operation Flashpoint 1985'. OPF1985 was considered the best of it's time when it was released and the Arma series has continued that tradition with many of the same developers that created OPF1985.  With a simple quick mission builder, a full blown complex high-end mission editor, mods, mods, and even more mods to make Arma III something really special to those of us who enjoy these type of games.  If you want the same feature set, but more realistic you would have to actually be in the military and have a security clearance and thousands of dollars. But you can get close to the same thing that real militaries around the world actually train with for less than $60 and you don't need to sign-up for service.  If you want to enjoy this, but can't afford it at full price or have an older or slower PC, then Arma II almost as chock full of features and mods so if you can't get this, get Arma II.
4484	1	a	To start off, this game is AMAZING. There is so much you can do in this game. I would call it basicly Garry's Mod with its own engine, amazing graphics, and a even better gameplay experience. There is multiple ways you can play this game. One, being its singleplay (Its 'okay' not the best, very good to learn the basics). Two, mission gamemodes, these can range from being 'Wasteland' to 'Altis Life' which are all fun and you can put tons of hours into them. And lastely, Mods, the PC community is known to make mods for popular games, you can play mods like 'Epoch' or 'Breaking Point' which are mods that are made to be like DayZ. Then there is the popular mod, 'A3L' which has brought a lot of attention to mods and arma 3 it self. Sometimes at night, with the light setting on Ultra it was the best looking lights that I have ever seen in video games EVER. On a scale of 1-10 I would rate this game 9/10.
3332	1	a	Outrageous war simulator !  10/10 
4159	1	a	Bananas are really nice.
4709	1	a	'Recommended Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560 or AMD Radeon HD 7750 with 1 GB VRAM or better'    hahahahahahaha, no. this is a very graphically intensive game and you need a gtx 970 if you want your game to look like the screenshots on the store page, and play at 60fps.
1493	1	a	The best war simulation game out there. You can do pretty much anything. The numerous mods and user created contect only make the game even better.
2527	1	a	nice game, love it, the mods again make it much and much better
4209	0	a	After playing this for a very long time I have come to the conclusion that the community has completely ruined this game.  This game is great and it has had a lot of attention put to it but the community is unbelievably stupid when it comes to gamemodes. There are only four gamemodes available in multiplayer and they're all flawed up the â¥â¥â¥. ================================================= Gamemode 1: Survival (Zombies and Wasteland)  Zombie modes are boring and Wasteland is extremely boring. ================================================= Gamemode 2: King of the Hill  This is the closest thing you'll get to proper PVP action but the leveling system is beyond awful! Newer players are utterly crushed by higher level players who are all wearing ghillie suits, holding high powered sniper rifles and flying around in jets with unlimited missles.  New players are given a starter weapon which is totally useless and you don't get anything good until you reach level 13 which wouldn't be a problem if the leveling didn't take FOREVER! Then you have the massive problem with team stacking because players are given a big XP reward if they win the game, so they all stack on one team making it impossible for other teams to win.  Overall King of the Hills leveling and cash system is awful and the best way to beat it, is to camp in the cap zone until you reach level 13 but that will take you a good ten hours. ================================================= Gamemode 3: Roleplay  Its just like DarkRP in Garry's Mod except its super laggy to the point where its unplayable and the servers are all ran by teenagers with serious issues because they setup these convoluted Police recruitment systems, then they have there police force act like the KGB.  Overall Atlis Roleplay is a waste of time because of lag and an endless stream of trolls who do everything in there power to make the game unplayable. ================================================= Gamemode 4: Battle Royale  I hope you like waiting in spectate or waiting for the server to unlock. ================================================= OVERALL  Community: The community ruined this game with flawed and boring gamemodes. If you're looking for the real Arma experince you have to join a clan but clans are really strict, only play at set times and don't like people who are new to the Arma series.   Game: I could go on for hours about the awful bugs, UI, DLC and price of the DLC but instead I'm going to talk about serious connection problems and the System Requirements.  Connection Problems: Even if you find a server thats in your country and you have a ping of 20 you'll still lag like crazy making the already broken hitboxes even harder to hit.  System Requirements: Thankfully I have a super computer and I can run this game on Ultra settings but this game will go to war with your CPU and Graphics card!  I miss Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead because people used to play cooperative gamemodes like Insurgency...I miss Insurgency....It almost brings a tear to my eye.  EDIT: After searching for countless hours I finally found a co-op Arma mission people play called Annex, its pretty good but this game is still NOT worth your money!
4669	1	a	I walked and walked for days. Found one guy. He killed me. Had to start walking all over again. 10/10 Would Recommend.
2578	1	a	Great game I have had many hours of fun. One of the best military (if not the best) i have played.
1746	1	a	Great game, good graphics.
1103	1	a	Got in a submarine, found Crush. Still finding Nemo.
1895	1	a	Has lots of fun game modes and doesn't really get boring! Totally pick this one up!
234	1	a	Over 200 hours for me. Thumbs up.
4273	1	a	Very nice and cool game!
2298	1	a	of cos
486	1	a	This an amazing military simulator with so many things to do! You can make your own battles on the editor, play the story line, or get mods and other missions that the ArmA III Community made! I wasn't sure about buying at first but now I'm glad I bought it!
1994	1	a	8/8 m8 i have too many hours on this game. It's just arma 2 with better graphics and better everything else.
1309	1	a	One of the best simulator games i played!
4098	1	a	10/10
3995	1	a	you have a friend? play this game  you dont have friend? play this game  you dont have this game? buy the game you dont have money? get a job you dont have job? die â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ dieee !
4073	1	a	very good dont know what else i would play
3306	1	a	ARMA 3 is my go to game... always new mod coming out and this make for free amazing content
2148	1	a	If you're looking for a military simulator then Arma 3 is your best bet. Realistic gameplay. Great graphics and sound effects. Lots of gameplay modes available. Would definitely recommend!
5262	1	a	I tried to go down a slide.  Biggest mistake I ever made. Thankfully there was a kind doctor nearby who saved my life from the evil creature that was the slide. Notify the government, slides are lethal. And to think we let children play on them. Science has gone too far I say!  10/10 for kind doctors who understand the dangers of slides.
564	1	a	Fantastic game. The single player content, showcases and training are good. The real meat of the game is in its multiplayer though. Admittedly, it can be a bit confusing at first if you're a new player, as some servers require you to download mods before you can join the server. There doesn't tend to be a whole lot of 'vanilla' servers out there. However, the mods are fantastic and worth the effort, especially if you play them with a group of people.  My favorite experience thus far was when we were playing the 'Insurgency' mod (military vs terrorists). There's a mod called Task Force Radio, which in a nut shell provides much more realistic radios to use. Each faction has their own encrypted radio, various channels you can switch to and various ranges of radio (long range and short range). As the military, we were attempting to locate intel that was known to exist in a village. A squad was unfortunately KIA, and for the next two hours, the military was getting picked off constantly. I even deployed with a buddy deep into a mountain with full camo, let my team know that where I was and I had good sights on the village, and not 2 minutes later I got sniped even though I was hardly exposed and never took a shot. Later, it turns out they stole a radio off a dead squadmate and were listening to our radio chatter and our positions for 2 hours and we all had a good laugh as the terrorists won.  10/10
3182	1	a	Really good game
4645	1	a	  Hellmann's and Best Foods are brand names that are used for the same line of mayonnaise and other food products. The Hellmann's brand is sold in the United States east of the Rocky Mountains, and also in Latin America, Europe, Middle East and Canada. The Best Foods brand is sold in the United States west of the Rocky Mountains, and also in Asia, Australia, and New Zealand.  Hellmann's and Best Foods are marketed in a similar way. Their logos and web sites resemble one another, and they have the same English slogan: 'Bring out the best'.  Both brands were previously sold by the U.S.-based Bestfoods Corporation, which also sold several other food products in addition to Hellmann's and Best Foods mayonnaise. Bestfoods, known as CPC international before 1997, was acquired by Unilever in 2000.ï»¿
1928	1	a	Overall great game. Although I don't see the point in making a 'mil sim' revolve around technology that isin't invented and probably never will be. The fun in a sim is seeing real life guns, tanks, fighters and heli's. We all know Fairchild Aircraft wont be making a next gen warthog and that no carribean country will ever have a military worth fearing. It tries so hard to be realistic and far fetched at the same time. Although one could argue that arma 2's 'current time' military equipment can just be ported over, it'll never be in 'muh glorious high poly models' as arma 3's.   7/10
4750	1	a	Simply the best team, team orientated, tactical sim there is.
4269	1	a	Wasted 200 hrs of my life  10/10  
4620	1	a	absolutly amazing game!
5023	1	a	Very Tactical, Strategy, I've enjoyed this game way too much, I recommend it. You'll have way too much fun if you bring friends.
4177	0	a	the campaign in this game is by far one of the absolute worst games i have ever played in my life, if not it is THE absolute worst game ever, horrible hit detection, cheap deaths, and terrible weapon sway make the campaign virtualy unplayable. I am a soldier in real life, not a reservist, a full time reg force soldier and with my experience in the army i can seriously tell you that this game is faaaaaaaaar from being realistic, i hate this game i cant beleive i spent 70 bucks on it it worth about 2 dollars in my opinion. dont buy this game you WILL be dissapointed.  LMFAO ive played every mode of this game now and its sooooooo broken its hilariouse i cant beleive this game sells and that people actually play it WORST GAME EVER!!!!!!!
1818	1	a	9/10 Would rate more if it didnÂ´t cost this little.
3919	1	a	Ok first off HOLY CRAP this game is sweet. If you cant pay the normal 60 bucks wait till it goes for les( I got mine for 30 i think) I would call it a military simulation with a shooter twist. A great game thats lots of fun. You can be seriouse and treat it like its real life or just â¥â¥â¥â¥ around like i do most of the time and blow stuff up. If you liked Dayz in arma 2 there is breaking point wich i play and that is pretty good but can get a little frustrating. But over all 10/10 would buy again. Seriously if your PC can handle it get it.
1557	1	a	There we were, a band of brothers, enlisted in the US Army. It was me, the quiet but serious medic the RPG guy who loved his rocket launcher more than his wife and spoke highly of it in area chat the wise joke cracking rifleman who couldn't resist a good pun the russian with broken english who sniped so much you could of thought he was vasily zaytsev the kind hearted squad leader who left no man behind and treated everyone as an equal and the slow learning new machine gunner with a laugh that touch the soul
1672	1	a	good graphics . the control is harder but its a good game
1789	1	a	'We need Evac!'  'Where's that evac!?'  'â¥â¥â¥â¥ no evac!'  Dead
4658	1	a	ArmA 3 is a great game, there are some down sides like the optimization, and the hackers, but they have cleared mainly all the hackers out, but the FPS is still kinda bad. Lots of ways to 'Fix' it, but overall the game is amazing it has so many different game modes to play like Wasteland, Altis Life, King of the Hill, and many more. I really would say if you are looking for a game to have hours and hours of fun, never run out of things to do, get ArmA 3. So many different things you can do.   I rate the game 8/10 because it looks amazing, so many things to do, but the optimization kinda sucks.
3788	1	a	As always, this still is the best military simulator in the world! ArmA keeps affascinating me for its realism. I really suggest you to buy the game if you're a 'fan of war', real war. The maps are really detailed and the AI is really â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥! Actually, too much but there are mods that can help you resolve that problem. Anyway, if you buy this game, PLAY IT WITH A CLAN. Arma 3 really makes you cooperate with other people in order to survive and complete your mission. if you're a CoD fan, you rather change side or forget about ArmA. They are completely different, and ArmA itself is usually not liked by 'shoot and run' fan boys. However, ArmA's editor allows you to create your own missions in every detail. Actually, it's not too simple making them, but with some commands and other stuff you can start making some nice missions and enjoy the game with your friends. Furthermore, there are tons of forums and people that can help you improve your editing skills providing you with commands, suggestions, and scripts. ENJOY.
2150	1	a	This is my Go to, This Game is amazing alone but combine with ACE, TFR and Friends nothing can go wrong... Not. In the end i would recommend this game to anyone looking for a serious MilSim enviroment, tons of fun awaits anyone in this game.
35	1	a	I think this is the best game in the series and the exapansions are very good, still plays and feels amazing in 2015, and i love the online play.
1565	1	a	great game, mainly play it with mods, exile ect
3823	1	a	Best war simulator ever made specially in infantry , there are lots of war simulator games like squads , operation flashpoint series and many others but arma 3 is something else ... !   If you want to learn and get some real war experience buy this game ,  But if you are looking for a simple shooting game that you carry a gun and keep shooting enemies just like battlefield , call of duty , cs go and ... , I suggest you to do not buy this game otherwise this game going to be a boring game for you .   Great graphic quality , nice game control , AI's have great artificial intelligence witch you can set Difficulty for them and co-op is awesome , also PVP is great and campaign is good for learning .
4734	1	a	Arma 3, a game that blurs the lines between being a military sim and being absolutely rediculous. The engine is powerful enough to allow for small countries to be mapped, have thousands of ai's, and also have over a hundred players. Mods offer near endless content. This game can be litterally whatever you want it to. Zombie survival, milsim, roleplay, or whatever. The limits are your imagination and not if Bohemia will add functionality to allow your mod to work correctly, but when.
2716	1	a	The gameplay is great ! But stability :/ with a gtx980TI and i7 4790k I get alot of frames drop ...
2400	1	a	Over 1000 hours across all my accounts of fun. Every PC gamer should play this game. 10/10
5080	1	a	You can sell drugs.  11/10  Hello NSA
3280	1	a	Great military simulator. Even better with mods that improve immersion.
4014	1	a	This game is one of the most realistic war simulators ever, I have got over 2300 hours right now and it is one of the most addicting games I have played in a long time. There are so many game modes from TDM to survival and roll playing, it is well worth the money. If you have friends that play it then it makes it so much better. 100% recomend it to every one who wants to get! 
83	1	a	Was about to log out before I watched a man named 'john' play 'In the arms of an angel' while planes were falling around him before eventually killing him.  11/10 for feels, please get this game, for me, for john.
3861	1	a	A much better improvement in the way that Arma plays and looks, I recommend this game to all Arma 2 fans and incourage people whom have never played Arma to try it.
626	1	a	Love the ARMA franchise and will continue to support it, very good multiplayer games for all those who enjoy team work.
1067	1	a	really good game, needs a beafy pc though if you want it to look nice 
5036	1	a	very good game its very good for misim and if you don't like that there are a lot more game modes to try
210	0	a	Thank you Bohemia Interactive for confirming my beliefs that you have lost it.  I am not paying $15 for helicopters. Get â¥â¥â¥â¥ed.
2229	1	a	Really good game physics are preatty sick too major upgrade from arma 2 . Needs a few more weapons and vehicles maybe a bluefor transport APC. Need to fix the constant lag spikes when people are using custom weapons drove me insane in arma 2 and this one aswell but over all, good game.
4776	1	a	guys i got this game on the free weekend and now it says update queued and purchase game and it doesnt let me update it haaaaalpppppppp
460	1	a	I had to add some more things to this review, as I started to appreciate it even more after some time spent in the game, both playing and creating content.   I tend to get rambly, so this is going to be a TL;DR version for you if you don't like reading textwalls: It's just awesome. Very immersive and deep, rewarding, satisfying, milsim experience.  1st episode of campaign took me 4 hours of gameplay on its own. Both multiplayer and singleplayer are great, along with the community-made content available via workshop. Looks beautiful on graphics cranked up to ultra ;) I was even able to set my sampling to 150% without any performance loss after the recent updates and I have to say - the graphics are phenomenal.  Second and third episodes of campaign were good as well, added up towards a complete story which gave me some backup on game's plot and situation on Altis in 2035. Zeus is very exciting, but it takes some practice and experience to provide players with fun time. Fatigue &amp; weapon inertia updates added a lot of depth to shooting. Now there is rotorLib to come along with shooting from vehicles, and that's going to change helo flying entirely.  See what I'm doing here? I'm proving you the devs constantly make this game better, it evolves within your eyes, and every day you play it you find something new about it, for example - recently I found out the angular size of the moon is actually correct, the night sky mapping is accurate and you can navigate using the northern star, and measure the distance using your compass and mils on it, like in real life.  Enough of this rambling. I have to say it's breathtakingly good. The possibilities it offers, the dev team which continues to add deepness to it... Some people don't like the recent updates, but for me these updates just build up more realism and add to overall greatness. And the team takes feedback into account, having really good policies both on DLCs and on new content put into the game.   Things you can do modding it are pretty crazy. I'll give you an example for better understanding: - The game itself, in vanilla version, features pretty complex ballistic mechanics. It also features exhaust pipe particle effect of hot air. What has one to do with another you might ask?  Well, a mod author took the first one, added much more deepness to create accurate ballistic simulation, and even used the particle effect I've mentioned earlier to simulate bullet trace effect in high-power optics...  Yup, you can do anything you want with this game.
316	1	a	Loveing it with 800+ hours on it mre content PLEASE
2918	1	a	Great Game! Nuff said!
4063	1	a	You'll spend more time â¥â¥â¥â¥ing around in the editor than playing the actual game at all! 11/10
1157	1	a	Bohemia really knows how to create a war simulation game, I have no idea how did they get a game to run smoothly on a bad computer. Good job, BEST OF 2013!
1268	1	a	Arma 3 is another hard core shooter. It's hard to get into when you have never palyed Arma II. The graphics are amazing. There are multiple different scenarios to play if you dont feel like playing multiplayer. But I would say multiplayer is where the game is at its best. It may take some time to get into the action which is where the Arma 3 fails at, but once you are in the heat of battle the gameplay is unmatched by anyhting else. Communicating with squad mates, tactically moving about to achieve the objective, and the feeling of being in huge squad is just something no other game in my opinion has achieved. If you are interested in Arma 3 then I recommend you buy it. Although I don't have much time in Arma 3, and I have played many other FPS, I can clearly say that this is one of the better FPS out there. The first time I got into battle was what changed my view of Arma 3.
2241	1	a	This game is pretty well done, I would say this is in the top 20 games on steam it isnt fun as Arma 2 but it definitely improves the way the game runs, and the voice acting. There are also tons of missions to download of the workshop. I would have so say sniping in this game is my favorite. I would rate this game a 7/10 on the game scale.
3439	1	a	I'm going to make this review extremely short. This game is a very extreme sandbox/warfare simulator, I HIGHLY recommend this game for anybody able to run it. This game is extremely fun with Zeus-- the multiplayer sandbox/warfare simulator. You will not be dissapointed.
3085	1	a	Be me  Sees TM get shot runs to him drags him out off fire carries him 5 km After that  Flys in osprey osprey got shot down im on ground some chinese girl helps me and my teammates i see teammate on the ground drag him to humwe this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ING GREAT BUY IT  
2224	1	a	This game has me feeling mixed emotions. You jump in to the singleplayer and find the game to be very tactical and have a lot, and I mean A LOT, of controls. Then you get into combat and see that it's not as forgiving as other games. The challenge does make for some entertainment though. After you may want to check out multiplayer. You'll find that there is TONS of servers. Most of them playing mods like Altis life and Wasteland. These are indeed fun. As soon as you jump in you'll see tons of problems. None of which I've seen in singleplayer. The cars will be flying, animations crap up, and horrific frame rate drops. After all of this, I had a lot of fun. I did have friends to play this though. I would recommend this game, BUT it may not be as enjoyable without friends as with them. 8/10. All criticisms aside, it's still a game that is worth your money.
4495	1	a	Fantastic game with a lot of mods. The best military simulator i have played, you should get it if you have the money. The arma 3 Life Mod actually reminds me of GTA V but a lot of more role play in it. I recommend this game 10/10.
4632	1	a	My tank hit a bunny and exploded. Anti tank bunnies- great game fully recommended.  1500/10
4804	0	a	I found solitaire more fun  1. scopes dont zoom propely 2. multiplayer games are boring and have no point to them.. If you enjoy running around empty land gettin randomly shot by nothing and getting kicked out for no reason its great 3. No way to communicate with others in multiplayer and single player would be better if controls worked  Jus glad i did the free weekend and not wasted 30 bucks like i was going to
2351	1	a	love the vids but i wish it was cheaper 
3060	1	a	Better than counter-stroke.
875	1	a	Extremely Tactical, incredibly fun to play with friends. For people looking for a real military spec ops feel this is the game to get. The giant maps and the ability to edit and create your own missions allows for infinite possibilities of gameplay.
4494	1	a	Buy it as â¥â¥â¥â¥!!! you never try you never know!!!
879	1	a	Slow-paced and heavily strategic/tactical. It's a game that may not be 'fun', but it can be very immersive and tries to give you a breathtaking experience. If you're one of those guys that likes hardcore realistic simulation, then this game is definitely the best out there. Also it's more than just a game, it's a platform that has plenty of mods to keep you busy when the original theme of the game is not quite what you're looking for.
3507	1	a	This is one the best combat simulators ive ever played. The sand box on here is a blast and the steam work shop is awesome for user created content. The only down fall for me is that i dont have anyone to play this with.
605	1	a	Arma 3 = Awesomeness
5028	1	a	Arma 3's campaign is a big, powerful, deeply engrossing thing, but there is one disappointment: its lack of vehicular missions. Since the story focuses on one not particularly interesting character who is ultimately a grunt, there are no tank missions, no helicopter missions and no jet missions. I can understand why, to a point: Arma's vehicles, especially its airborne offering, take time and effort to learn to control. Moreover, in these kinds of games infantry combat tends to be more enjoyable anyway. On the other hand, Flashpoint offered plenty of vehicle engagements during its campaign without any issue, and it's frustrating that, 13 years on, Arma's campaigns still lag behind it in terms of breadth of experience. If you want to get familiar with Arma's military machinery, you'll need to look to the showcase missions, download one of the many community-built scenarios out there, or jump into the enormous multiplayer. There are a vast range of multiplayer game modes to take your fancy. King of the Hill challenges three teams of 16 players to wrest control of a particular objective using small arms, tanks, helicopters, the works. If you're of a more co-operative bent, there are a range of developer missions that require teamwork to beat the odds, including the enormous Escape From Altis mission, which tasks your plucky group with safely reaching the coastline while avoiding the sights of a vastly superior enemy force.  Yet the most interesting of Arma's multiplayer modes stem from the community. Wasteland is a survival mode in a similar vein to DayZ, but without the zombies and with considerably more military equipment. Altis Life, meanwhile, eschews the focus on soldiers in favour of a cops-and-robbers scenario, where players tired of making money through picking fruit or mining ore club together to perform elaborate bank heists and player-police hunt them down. A lengthy paid alpha followed by six months of staggered campaign releases has given Arma 3's multiplayer an extraordinary range.  This is largely thanks to the fantastic foundation that is the island of Altis, which makes every mission, every multiplayer match, every combat engagement feel unique. There's something about Bohemia's world-building that inspires people. Importantly though, Arma 3's vanilla content now stands on equal footing with those third-party inspirations. It's still a little rough around the edges, but it's a darned impressive package nonetheless.
1564	1	a	Having almost 700 hours played in this game, I would reccomend it to anyone trying to get away from the average FPS and get into something that actually gets your heart pumping. Tactics and wetting yourself as you hear a bullet crack by your ear or running face to face with an enemy nothing compares!

5381	0	a	Everything about this game improves on Arma II except for one key point. The game simply does not run. Not on high end machines, not on anything, it is so poorly optimised and coded that no system can run it smoothly (60 fps). Online games lag all the way down to 10-15 fps in cities just because the server code is poorly written and results in server side lag that effects frame rate as well as hit detection. If this game was actually able to run at a decent frame rate that stayed decent online it would be a wonderful game. Until that time i cannot recommend this game.
5025	0	a	Game was great until BattlEye launcher patch. Now I have a fucntional game that won't let me join any multiplayer servers because BattlEye won't work.   Deleted game and contents x2 with no fix.
1080	1	a	The amount of hours I have invested in this game should say it all. 10/10
2246	1	a	One of the best FPS games I have ever played!
2516	1	a	after a few hours played I think I like this game specially because of the mods and communities.
4132	1	a	  It's ARMA, what more do you expect?    Arma 3, the long awaited sequel to the outstanding Mil-Sim franchise by Bohemia Interactive.  This game is fantastc, theres no real other way to describe it. I have been a relative late comer to the Arma franchise starting with Arma 2 and Operation Arrowhead, though this third instalment certainly seems to fill the spaces with features that i had been longing for since playing its predecessor. Both modernised and revamped in both style, looks and gameplay; this game certainly plays smooth and looks amazing - i honestly struggle to find games as 'Open World' as this that look so beautiful at times.  The main draw of Arma 3 is certainly the online gameplay, new gamemodes such as Sector Control offer new light to the often dimming possibilities of such a 'complex' Mil-Sim game. Along with a consistant stream of community content flooding by much like Arma 2. Even the singleplayer campaign developed by Bohemia is absolutley brilliant if not at times frustrating.  However, it does indeed have it's draw backs. Having extensivley played its sequel you cannot help but feel like Arma 3 has 'something' missing. A little something that really does take away from the enjoyment of the game. The collection of weaponry feels at times limited and the distinct lack of certain features (Such as Bi-pods) have been completely overlooked and not implimented.  Despite this, Arma 3 is none the less a fantastic game well worth the purchase, and with the constant updates introducing new features - i'm sure it wont be long before all these little issues i have with the game are ironed out.    Recommended?:   Absolutley yes   Score:   8/10
1409	1	a	a must have game
3051	1	a	I think this game is the best game. If u guyz getting bored in single player u should try altislife mode in multiplayer. If u guyz find the price expensive u should wait for discounts but I think this game is worth that price u should check it out   10/10   Have Fun Bros :)
2212	1	a	If you have a good computer and friends get this game........do it...........now!
4144	1	a	Hey all you people, Hey all you people, Hey all you people, won't you listen to me? I just had a sandwich, No ordinary sandwich, A sandwich filled with jellyfish jelly... Hey, man! You've got to try this sandwich! It's no ordinary sandwich! It's the tastiest sandwich in the sea... Skee ba-da bob-a doob-a dob-a dab-a dee dow, Yeah!
1507	1	a	this game would be advisable to play with friends as gives you a more realistic feel to the game.
1302	1	a	this game rock 
4135	1	a	Verry good game and had great fun on king of the hill really recommend it if your into fighting and action games
3828	1	a	Get it. Buy it. Play it.  You can literally do anything you want. Use your imagination folks! Best game for an FPS, by far.
3068	1	a	This game is good and a lot of fun with friends money is a bit hard to get some times.But if you play this enjoy it.
2880	1	a	It's ok I guess.
3493	1	a	3/10 looks nice but basicaly nothing works everything's buggy as hell cant even walk down stairs without being killed by the map
3048	1	a	Seriously, just buy it. Best game.
3658	1	a	Love this series since  Operation Flashpoint  (original not the other monster). Bohemia created something that I followed for years and it's longest franchise I'm attached to. Free and open, great action, harcore tactics, hard and yet I scream for more many emotions come to my mind. A3 is evolution of greatest A2 (which born Dayz mod) which I treasue most for so many great memories.  pros * open world * can be modded, greatest strenght of this game * provides tons of good fun which increase with mods * one of or not if greatest platform for network based playing (up to 64 players) * mods (hmmm, did I say this already?) * decent storylines (pretty short though) * war climax, not too many games relate to civilian aspects of conflicts * audio (specially after tweak) * graphics on cool PC's and servers  cons * scripted body animation * no jumping (after all these years they did not figure ot out!?) * AI in long run fails or is OP * not a fun of vehicle driving here
1306	1	a	Ahh Arma 3... God what a fantastice game Now this game, I would rate it a 7/10. Why you may ask? Here's the reason This game is open world, amazing, physics can be a little wonky, but it gives you such a realistic feeling it's amazing. Want to play with zombies? Go for it, in development but hey, it still counts. Want to roleplay with your friends? Tons of servers waiting for you. While this game isn't exactly optimized for PC in the best way, FPS drops, random crashes, high ping, it is still one hell of a game, go buy it, NOW
3640	1	a	Best game and best update APEX
2652	1	a	After many months of waiting we all have finally a good product in line with others arma serie sims....i can say without hairs on toungue...yes...it's a game to purchase absolutely because it's the only simulation that give to all players who want some in more about realism and gameplay.Can be a bit frustrating at start cause it's a sim and not a game but anyway you can also set it as a game ....more easy as you want .It is a sim settable really as you desire in all aspects...so...now there is nomore excuses for to say i wait a bit for to have it Finally the second island of the game called Altis it's a capolavour of design ...go to check there all the hundreds of things into Altis map and you ll see the delicious attention for the more fine details.The AI is improved as sound 3D and in general all you did like into arma serie is here in more detailed graphic and sound with a new engine.
2350	1	a	Nvidia GTX 780 = $800 ASUS 24' 1080p Monitor = $300 Playing on all lows and still getting 10fps = ArmA 3
1509	1	a	It's the most accurate, realistic(apart from wildlife in the game) and versatile military simulator I've ever let my eyes on. I will even go that far to say it's the best military simulator that man has ever made...
1667	1	a	Though unlike Arma II and Arma II OA, Arma III was less involved in a realistic soldier game and more of the FPS Call of Duty style. Although new technology has been added, it has very few new things. Notice in Arma OA the large amount of vehicles and weapons? The game makers did not get lazy, but really could have added more. The game is really stable and does not have unexpected crashes, or none that I have had.  Arma III gameplay is enough to make me want to take meth however. I understand most missions are player created but really they are all the same 'kill all the Muslims' I understand thats the art of war but most missions are the same. I recommend playing Zues because its more developing now.  Overall I recommend Arma III, but just barely. I am not that picky about my games but I felt it needed to be critical with the Arma serious as they do build up a lot of hipe before a game release. I would rank the the game 6/10 , just because of the lack of realism and lack of a dynamic gameplay. In short imagine 20 9/11s, thats arma 3
2559	1	a	Honestly I dont know why you are reading reviews. Buy the game. There is soooooo much you can do with this. Everything from wasteland servers to Epoch to Altis life. It can be a zombie game. Or it can be a Mil sim. It can be a non broken form of GTA. Or it could be a racing game.  Only con is you have to pay for DLC. The content in the DLC should have already been included -_-
5086	0	a	Yes, this is the fanciest milsim(actually it's mostly a walking/driving/looking for only-god-and-thermal-scopes-know-where-they-are enemies simulator) you can find out there, but -  AI can't get more stupid, vanilla weapons can't get uglier, dlcs can't get more expensive, the new running animation can't get more awful. 'please exit arma 3 to manage your mods'. yeah, can't even check out what mods i have loaded - i have to either exit the game or use the clunky mod list at main menu. Recently, the game starts getting random crashes and black screens. But to be fair, it could be caused by mods. Annnd... BI probably found it was a good idea to charge a few extra bucks for some more ugly guns and the bipods which should be implemented years ago. Some mods already had functional bipods/weapon resting way before the official bipod update. Not to mention there are plenty of weapon mods holding a higher quality standard than vanilla and dlc weapons.  So this game only have got worse after all these years? Good job, duh.
3385	1	a	Stole a police car then drowned in the water while a child cop told me im stupid  12/10 would recommend
553	1	a	THIS GAME MAKES ME SO â¥â¥â¥â¥ING MOIST  YIFF/YIFF WOULD RECCOMEND
2341	1	a	Must play game !!!
3932	1	a	Very fun game. Playable for hours on hours. Great community, and lots of addons. Totally recommended.
89	1	a	Decide to play Arma 3. Log into Exile Server Start Driving with American Friends, with one Brit in the car Sun starts coming up Tell Driver to pull over All the Americans step out We line up outside of the Ifrit Every American salutes the sun rise Give 21 gun salute Brit sits awkwardly in car  20/10 Would be Patriotic as â¥â¥â¥â¥ again
4343	1	a	The ten step guide to play Arma 3 Step 1: Start up game Step 2: Pick Loadout Step 3: Find vehicle Step 4: Take twenty minutes to drive to objective. Step 5: Arrive at objective. Step 6: Get killed a minute later. Step 7: Repeat step 3 - 6 Step 8: Repeat Step 7 another six or so times Step 9: Repeat steps 3-5 before you realise that the objective has been completed. Step 10: Repeat Steps 3 - 9 and soon enough you might actually achieve something in this game.
2115	1	a	Positives -  Good Semi-Realistic Military Shooter Good varity on weapons/Vehicles Semi Decent Campaign Awsome Editor Good Visauls Good Sounds Negitives -  AI that keep be coded by a 4 year old And wonky animations here and there
2388	1	a	This game is fantastic if you enjoy games that require you to work as a team to complete objectives. Grab some friends jump on a server and let the team building begin. Prefer to go solo? Well the Campaign is absolutley spectacular. Still not interested? You can always play with the mods that are always coming out and being updated. In short there is something for everyone.
5121	1	a	this game is so hard, i can't even get in the car
1397	1	a	dont walk across Altis when playing this game...you'll have 30 hours by the time you hit the other side...
3392	1	a	I stepped through a 8 foot wall and took out the enemy patrol 420/69 would wall magic again
1860	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ me this is amazing.
2415	1	a	I camped in a Gunstore for 5 days and it took 3 tries with a tank and MG crew to dislodge me. 11/10
2866	1	a	Any other FPS, is just a toy.
5052	1	a	This is as real as it gets for war games. If your looking for a good realistic game this is for you 10/10.
2175	1	a	Fantastic game, if you love games like battlefield4 and fallout4 this is your dream game come true. I play mostly the Exile mod and its a great time with mates hunting down other people.
2514	1	a	My opinion about arma3:Its a very cool first person game in wich you can do a lot of stuff on multiplayer.On singeplayer tho i havent played it yet so i have no clue :D.Just buy this game if u like cars,airplanes,boats and strategics cause this game needs a lot of strategy.
4914	1	a	Not much i can say one of the best games i have played
4109	1	a	If you're looking for serious fun, you've come to the right place.
2520	1	a	If you've ever played and liked military shooters BUY THIS GAME NOW
3205	1	a	Have you ever played a modern/futuristic (Arma 3 is in the middle, it's in 2035, not that futuristic after all) FPS war game with a full-scale war? If you haven't then please play this game, 3D art is done fantastically well, the game lets you control almost everything, there is a wide variety of vehicles and weapons you can drive and shoot, however it was one of the most difficult campaigns i have ever played, it took me 47 hours to complete with skipping ~6 missions if i remember precisely because they were too difficult, if you are coming from cod or bf you will have a hard time transitioning into arma, but it is totally worth the time, at sometimes the AI was acting a bit stupid but not as much as arma 2. Unfortunately those AI moments where the soldiers used cover were scripted, but hell, the atmosphere, I've never experienced something as cool as this. The game takes place on 2 beautifull greek islands, Agios Efstratios (mentioned as stratis in-game) and Lemnos(mentioned as altis in-game). The storyline was also good, instead of being the typical world savior you are a normal soldier who takes part on a war, nothing more or less, you'll love it though.   I have to mention a funny incident that happened during gameplay: I am a greek citizen and i have to point out that cicadas show up during the summer, and you don't usually build a fire in the summer during day time... something that some soldiers were doing in the game. Looking forward to arma 4 being released, im sure it will be as good as arma 3 and maybe even better (maybe better optimised than arma 3 since it does not sympathize amd cpus). That's it, amazing game overall.
1480	1	a	Awesome game. Worth the money if you like strategic shooters.
1187	1	a	its like skyrim, with military grade weapons
151	1	a	Its OK.............. :) 3560 hours later. THiS GAME I AWSOME!!!!!!!! (and still getting better by the day)
2829	1	a	Stunning Game, i guess the one thing i've always loved about the ArmA series is the  MASSIVE   range of community mods.   So many new gamemodes are developed every few months you can never get bored.      9/10 (DLC's bit stingy)        Stay Spooky   
2713	1	a	great game overall, needs some optimizition though
547	1	a	  Brief Review    Arma 3 from Bohemia Interactive is the latest in its military simulation series of games, which began with the original Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis.   While shipping with a small amount of actual content, that is not what Arma 3 or the Arma franchise is all about. The huge influx of Steam Workshop content, multiplayer and editor make this a full package for the most serious of combat simulator nuts    Pros and Cons     Pros   New vehicle physics are great Butterfly shadows Massive world to explore with lots of potential for long-range engagements (270 kmÂ²) Extremely detailed, lush visual presentation Hyper-realistic combat will satisfy even the most die-hard sim enthusiasts Huge variety in terms of gameplay scenarios    Cons   Controls feel clunky Very steep learning curve You will need a new PC (Most likely)    An Ending    Arma as a franchise is class leading at what it does - Military simulation refined and mastered
1124	1	a	In this game, you're not the hero anymore. Instead, you are the one getting shot by the hero.
464	1	a	I love the epic in-game stuff, you can't go all Call of Duty on it or Battlefield, this is the real â¥â¥â¥â¥. 
341	1	a	Best Military Simulation Game Ever!
665	1	a	Games a blast. You will get way more than your moneys worth with this. The DLC's added have all been really well done, excellent content added also. New Stamina system is a HUGE pain in the â¥â¥â¥ as it feels like you are an obese land whale who can't handle a 5m sprint. Mods are what makes this game that much better, well the community content in general. Lots of people out there make great missions and host fantastic servers all of which can drastically change anyones experience. I personally don't like the near futuristic setting but I like that they tried something new. (10 tonne of mods to change it to how you want it anyway).   Pros:  Community  Mods  Good Devs  Heaps of content  Lots of fun  Visuals are great  3D editor   Cons:  Sometimes ridiculous AI  Can take a bit of fiddling to get it to how you would like it 
3898	1	a	Fun game, If you get bored playing one game mode there are hundreds others to choose from, never ending fun!
3636	1	a	Best war simulator ever. Ran with my tank over a very tiny rock, did double backflip and exploded. Physics work on 110%. I can only recommend.
5171	0	a	It's not very friendly to beginners. The steep learning curve takes away a lot of the fun. Especially because it's a multi player focused game and there are very few game types active at any given time, and the ones that are active require paid DLC. So, I paid 40 bucks and it's not very fun to play, if you can even get into a game.
706	1	a	I don't even have this game, why can I write a review for it?
1894	1	a	this game is art
5144	0	a	Game is pretty cool and detailed ... but its aparently going down the pay for any extra content road Im a cheapskate ... paying for extra model just make me sick ....  if they would come out with actual add-on Ie wait a year or two finish singling out every issue  with your engine then come out with a dlc adding a bit of everythng + some mission i m on thats fine by me i'd buy  But here the game does not feel finished to me maybe they need to come out with more DLC's .... Just my opinion
3189	0	a	Ok where too start, the game is fun and if you have a group of friends even better, now with that said the game is laggy and when i say laggy i mean very laggy. I'm running a 290x with an 8320 asrock mobo and it still can't run this game you want too know why, they don't give a â¥â¥â¥â¥ you got it now your stuck with it, they don't fix anything just save your money and get something else maybe if you have an intel it may run better but my brother have intel and you know what he can't run it either so don't get it i'm telling you right now you will be sorry. And what's sad is i love the game when i can play it, it's a good game but oh man does it suck
2160	1	a	This Is The Best Milsim game you will find it has a wonderfull comunity And everysingle gamemode  you dream off wil be there you have everything from Roleplay To fighting zombie's Came for The war XP Then why not join An Milsim unit , This Game is an Must have
1175	1	a	I've started playing Altis Life , bought some stuff and a car , and after some time I got killed by a desync.(Altis players will know what I mean) 10/10 but avoid other people
3434	1	a	Good game, good graphics, flying cars, broken physics  11/10 would fly again
530	1	a	I have a love hate for this game. Dont get me wrong this by far best mil sim out here other than 'Project Reality 1.0' when it comes to PVP. With mods that offered in  ArmAholic.com  and many missons that offered in workshop this game can quite addicting i mean you can spend hours among hours on ArmA 3. i almost was late for work cause i was having so much enjoyment with this game. One thing i don't understand why they will charge so much for this game i got it for 20 bucks on  {LINK REMOVED}  â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.net .  my only cons are:  - The Braindead (dont care about it own life nor teammates) AI i spend hours on hours looking online for Ai Mods for this game to better my play exp. -Not many Jets  -Not many weapons right out the box (go to  armaholic.com  for weapons packs)  -Server Broswer it just hell of a mess -Still a bit unoptimized -This Game is more CPU focused then GPU so have a good CPU and your good to go  -Needs a better VOIP system -Needs to teamup with Punkbuster  -The Island just dont seems right for the current confilct offered in the game  -Wish there was a life walking around 'women' and men etc walking around  -Wish not every town look the same    But be smart dont throw 60 bucks at this look around for deals like i got   {LINK REMOVED}  â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.net   Cheapdigitaldownload.com  100% legit
2081	1	a	Found the game had a lack of gameplay. Struggled to find things to do.
574	1	a	They fixed fatigue and a worth while DLC is on the way. Who died and took over? ----------------------------------- [Fatigue Update] This has ruined the game. I'm not even exagerating. Unless you only use vehicles 24/7 this update will have ruined the game for you, making you aim like a drunkard after jogging about all of 10m and forcing you to walk at a snails pace after a whole 20m. That's some â¥â¥â¥â¥ing wonderful realism, isn't it guys. ----------------------------------- If I had to compare Arma 3 to another game, I'd say its the grandchild of Battlefield and Skyrim. With massive-scale combat, maps that dwarf any other shooter without question, and a variety of user-made game modes along with the vanilla series of Zeus game modes there is no shortage of content. In the recently added Zeus modes you can even turn this first-person shooter into an RTS game.  The game mechanics are mostly solid however some minor things such as falling damage, parachute mechanics, and cars/trucks turning to useless wrecks after a realtively minor bump into anything leave plenty of room for improvement. Bugs are also still a signifigant issue, even to the point of causing some destroyed buildings to randomly shoot someone into the air and have them fall to their death. And in general, the engine feels stiff.  Much like Skyrimâissues asside, if you find the right game mode for you, almost anyone should be able to find some enjoyment out of Arma 3. Whether you're some hardcore-roleplaying type, want to fight for survival all over an island, or simply want to vie for control over a city; there is plenty to do.
1840	1	a	-=Recommended=-  Definetly one of the best tactical shooters out there and worth buying because of...   -beautiful (and realistic looking) graphics   -good and very tactical game- and especially gunplay  -complex and realistic (physics-) engine  -nice community  -good mod-support
718	1	a	Really amazing game i play it almost everyday the campaign is amazing also plus the fact that you can get mods to is another amazing thing like Arma 3 Life is what i play really its just a amazing. fun, gane that everyone chould get ive played for a LONG time and i still love this give 10/10
4862	1	a	Very good game just need to fix bugs i recommend it to all
851	1	a	a wonderfully satisfying pc game,many game-modes, huge maps, plenty vehicles, awesone weapons, ect. definetly worth the $59.99
2360	1	a	Cats R furry!
2413	1	a	this game is amazing :D 10/10 btw u need a good pc to run this
4445	0	a	3.5/10   If you are a passive and slow in playing game this is the right game for you. It is too slow and has SOO MANY GLITCHES YOU HAVE NO IDEA!! I will give it credit becase it is like skyrim, free roaming type but the controls are too much and in general, it sucks, i would recomend no getting thi sgame and not wasting your 60 bucks, keeps it for something better. Please, don't buy this game.
2756	1	a	Overall great game, nothing else like it. Bohemia Interactive have made one of the best game series ever made and is a revolutionary game company, think about this Bohemia interactive update their game for free I'd say about every month or so with MASSIVE amounts of new features bug fixes new things to do and new ideas. When Bohemia wants to make a DLC they only put things that are not going to divide their multiplayer community (some people not being able to use important things because they do not have the DLC) in their DLC's, along with coming out with new features for the community as a whole; such as shooting from vehicles, advanced flight model, and bipods. Take a look at any other triple A game company and Bohemia Interactive is on a completely different level than said company. There is always something new to do in ArmA, especially since the new Eden Editor came out which allows for the community to make missions in a 3d environment with scripting, timing, individual attributes, the Eden Editor provides the community with a way to make their own content allowing for ArmA to keep getting refreshed; just look at the workshop. In the end   ArmA III is the best game Bohemia Interactive has made so far, and will continue to provide me and my friends hours of fun in times to come.     TL;DR: 10/10 IGN buy this game because its the most functional piece of art on the planet.
4026	1	a	Now, this is a story all about how My life got flipped-turned upside down And I'd like to take a minute Just sit right there I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air  In west Philadelphia born and raised On the playground was where I spent most of my days Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school When a couple of guys who were up to no good Started making trouble in my neighborhood I got in one little fight and my mom got scared She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'  I begged and pleaded with her day after day But she packed my suit case and sent me on my way She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket. I put my Walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'.  First class, yo this is bad Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass. Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like? Hmmmmm this might be alright.  But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat? I don't think so I'll see when I get there I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air  Well, the plane landed and when I came out There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out I ain't trying to get arrested yet I just got here I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared  I whistled for a cab and when it came near The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror If anything I could say that this cab was rare But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, homes to Bel Air'  I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8 And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo homes smell ya later' I looked at my kingdom I was finally there To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air

852	1	a	After god-knows how many hours on this game, I finally decided to review it.  The gameplay is absolutely amazing, mind you bloody difficult to learn at first. The servers range from things as simple as a king of the hill match, to full out no restrictions war zones full of snipers, infantrymen, armour and airborne demons. I definetly would reccommend this to anywho want an immersive, hyper-realistic military simulator with near endless modding opportunities.  Home to the new, updated Epoch which was popular on Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead.                                              If you doubt how good it is, check out gameplay videos or screenshots. Do eit.
4731	1	a	Great Mil-Sim. I love the graphics, gameplay, and the amount of content it has. It's endless fun, really. Do you like realistic shooters? This is for you. Do you like military simulators? This is for you. It's been 2 years but this game is still hella fun.
3033	1	a	ARMA SHOULD NOT HAVE DLC.
1891	1	a	GOOD GAME I RECOOMEEND TO EVEIBODIE
2454	1	a	Fun and open world game with really good gamemodes and lots of fun, Make sure your Pc can Handle the game before you get it though.
1417	1	a	Its a real war!!!!!
1147	1	a	I am very recommend this game , super realistic with the new update 10/10 - Gameplay 
2327	1	a	sick AF CCCC
4848	1	a	its bloody crap fam
1162	1	a	Ok time for me to get around to this.   At first, Coming from ARMA 2 vet, it was quite confusing to play seeing how control are tad bit different. However I quickly learned it was for good. You no longer need to scroll and select action menu. For simple item, you can just enter boxes, open door, pick up item just one click away. For complicated stuff, action menu is there for you. But remmeber, do use mousewheel select or you'll shoot instead. Haha. Also Gears are now Inventory. So thats I not G because G will drop a nade and kill you.   Now for the game. I personally disliked the future theme it had going on. However, Thankful for Armaholic and super easy new mod system. I was able to mod the game back to current year. Not 2035. I recommend getting a faction addon such as Canadian Force or Us Infantry with NATO - Spetsnaz Weapon Pack. They will make the game MORE better. Now I am making scenario like madman and playing it. Love how you can customize weapon, love how you can select gears and helmet to use. (Grass Helmet for the win)   Vanilla 4/10   with Mods 20/10   Also you dont need to wear pant or condom to play this.
1820	1	a	If you really want to â¥â¥â¥â¥ off some nerds, buy this and tell them it sucks and you are going to play COD on your XBOX.
1483	1	a	It has a play style for everyone, except for call of duty players. I definently recommend buying this when its on sale as there is no other game in the market like this!!!!
748	1	a	Great game, Highly recommend
1113	1	a	Simulation isn't the defining aspect of Arma. It's scale.  The enormity of the map is the foundation for the experiences that distinguish Bohemia Interactive's flagship franchise. It's what makes radios, topographical maps, binoculars, and compasses practical equipment in an FPS. It's what allows for kilometer-long headshots and coordinated convoy raids. It's what makes using your eyes to spot hints of enemies--muzzle flashes, tracers, gunsmoke--as valuable as being a crack shot.  The scale of Arma 3 dwarfs everything in the genre, including Arma 2 . Altis , a keyhole portion of which is seen in these screenshots, is a Mediterranean island-nation assembled from ruins, airports, coastal villages, solar power plants, military outposts, salt flats, and tank-friendly scrubland. It's a variegated backyard for you to play war in, but what's more significant is that Arma's landscape finally has the technology it deserves.   Arma 3 represents an aesthetic overhaul of the series. Unbelievable dynamic lighting, a volumetric cloud system, genuine vehicle physics, 3D weapon optics, ragdoll, noticeably improved weapon audio, and other grainy, eye-level details await scrutiny inside Arma 3's macro elegance. The best improvement is the merciful cutting of Arma 2's rigid, Tin-Man-without-oil combat animations, which makes infantry combat more responsive in your hands.  A half-year in paid pre-release has given Arma 3 time to gestate, but the final build is far from being a comprehensive reinvention of the series, and some long-standing blemishes that arise from its nature as a gargantuan simulation linger. Even on high-end hardware, my framerate dips under the spectacle of some multiplayer missions. Friendly AI units, though marginally better-behaved, still depend on the player to be their brains, an issue that's circumvented by playing Arma the way God intended it: cooperatively.   With voice-connected friends and a good user-created mission, Arma 3 is an unparalleled war story generator. On Operation Fault Line with a gang of Steam pals, I had to drive a clumsy, eight-wheeled transport called a HEMTT across the map. To protect this elephantine truck we had a IFV-6c Panther, an APC with a mounted grenade launcher and 12.7mm MG. Minutes after leaving base, our tanky bodyguard eats a land mine, ruining its left track. As we get out to survey the damage, rockets streak across the valley. Everyone's okay, but the Panther is immobilized.  Dumping the APC is the only option. We clump into the fragile HEMTT, burning diesel to get off the exposed ridge. Green tracers track the truck, eventually pricking some of my tires. The wheels don't deflate enough to go flat, but the suspension slumps to the left. For the rest of the mission I have to drive lopsided, constantly counter-steering just to keep the truck on the gravel road. But everyone works together to keep our war bus on track--my teammates give turn instructions, read the map, and scan the road for more mines.  When we're free of immediate danger, we send someone back to base to retrieve an ATV so that we have a forward scouting element. At one point we position two machinegunners with nightvision scopes at the lip of a valley to provide cover as we drive the HEMTT down an exposed valley, then taxi them back to us on the ATV. The sequence of events, the chatter, the wounds and kills we rack up, all developed because we happened to run over a mine and our tires got shot up.   Getting flexible  Arma's capacity for stimulating camaraderie, atmosphere, and problem-solving, in other words, is fully intact. The feeling of ownership that arises over these moments between you and your squadmates sticks in your brain. Central to this fun is how malleable Arma continues to be for its community, which before launch day had published almost 1,500 missions to Steam Workshop . Assuming you have an internet connection, this well of content compensates for the absence of an official campaign at launch, which will integrate in three free monthly installments beginning in October.  On the ground, a new stance adjustments system is the best thing that's ever happened to infantry combat in Arma. Holding the Ctrl key as a modifier while tapping W or S cycles between nine vertical stances, and you can also take a horizontal step in addition to using Q or E to lean. You feel articulate--making small body adjustments while behind cover initially feels like finger gymnastics, but the system makes more types of cover viable and more types of weapons viable in that cover. Coupled with the general smoothing of movement and the near elimination of Arma 2's uninterruptible, sluggish animations, running and gunning should finally feel comfortable to average FPS players.  On the opposite end of your gun, though, AI remains a shortcoming. Arma 3's enemies share plenty of their ancestors' DNA, which means that they oscillate between being eagle-eyed snipers at one moment and static, dumb, 3D silhouettes evocative of a light gun arcade game another. Their greatest flaw is that they lack personality, which mostly resigns them to being targets rather than soldiers.   A few sparks of intelligence did impress me--after we killed the rest of his squadmates, I watched a rifleman flee for the first time in Arma, setting up a tense shot where I had a narrow few seconds to snipe him in the back before he disappeared behind trees. This is the sort of human behavior I'd love to see more of, stuff like blind-firing, limping, throwing smoke grenades for cover, claiming abandoned vehicles, or looting bodies for supplies--anything that would lessen the predictability.  Friendly AI is even worse, unfortunately, because they're typically your responsibility. It's absurd that my squad's medic won't patch me up when I'm bleeding right next to him unless I order him to. Pathfinding isn't reliable, either: I spent five minutes repeating the âMove toâ¦â and âGet in vehicleâ commands, trying to convince a freed hostage and my squadmate to cross the map so we could finish the mission. They wouldn't budge. The crux of the issue is Arma's mile-long command menu, which scatters dozens of commands across all 10 numerical keys. Like the enemy AI, though, there are glimpses of authentic behavior. I felt like a proud parent when my AI fireteam, unprompted, broke formation and spread themselves behind cover during a raid on a cluttered factory.   Breaking formation  Bohemia's graphical improvements are substantial enough to make Arma 3 one of the most visually impressive games on any platform. Altis (and its little-brother island Stratis) are rendered with incredible clarity, illuminated by lighting that produces pink sunsets, blinding solar glare, and golden afternoons. I love the way the earth feels textured as you jog and crawl through it--gravel, sand, and grass all emit different sounds under your boots.  I'm mostly happy with the graphical performance I've been getting on the three configurations I've been playing Arma 3 on. The caveat being that my framerate varies based on where I am on the map, the number of objects and enemies, and if I'm playing online. On a Core-i7 X990 at 3.47 GHz and two AMD Radeon 5970s on Very High settings, I've gotten 17-25 FPS on one single-player mission and 40-50 on another. Multiplayer is where I found the least-consistent performance. On a Core-i7 870 and GTX 780, I can get 55 FPS in a tight, six-player scenario on Very High, but 20 in a large-format mission like Wasteland .  Tinkering with Arma 3's 25 configurable video settings allowed me to improve these numbers a little, but even dialing down the quality to standard or low on my rigs barely helped while playing large multiplayer missions. The scripting or complexity of some scenarios simply seems to bottleneck performance regardless of your settings. Some specific actions also consistently produced framerate dips for me, (Sorry ran out of words)
2106	1	a	I dont even have the game, but i can write a review.   10/10
3696	1	a	great game, what more. Just need a decebt pc
5215	1	a	Arma 3 isn't a game about Shootin. It's About The Life Of Your Character It's about How Long you Can strive And Live It's About Flyig It's about Driveing It's About Liveing! Forget About Shooting let Your Vehicles Do It For You....This Is what THIS GAME IS ABOUT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN!

5112	0	a	 âââââ
2682	1	a	Brilliant game when you can find the right server with level headed people.
5208	1	a	Arma 3 is the definite game in the military simulation series from Bohemia Interactive. From massive and highly-detailed environments to expansive collections of weapons and vehicles, Arma 3 is a modern military sandbox for both players and modders. Arma 3's most exciting aspects are the built-in editor, Steam Workshop support, and near endless possibilities of community-created scenarios. Arma 3 refines and masters the military simulation genre.
3733	1	a	Awesome game, only requires a good pc.
4856	1	a	Played Altis Life, Smoked Weed, Got Arrested, 10/10
1351	1	a	An improvement from ArmA 2 in every way.
2760	1	a	buy this game
478	1	a	Just finished the loading screen.  11/10 would load again.
5078	1	a	Guns, tanks, choppers, bombs, â¥â¥â¥â¥ if you really look hard  what more do you want  
4941	1	a	This game is extreamly addicting, fun, and diverse... And the maps are HUGE!!!
5000	1	a	Not much i can say one of the best games i have played
1034	1	a	My potato has 2 anuses. 10/10
3531	1	a	It is such a good game all though it run's like a b*tch
1539	1	a	Don't bother playing in Multipayer if you have bad Internet connection ,
1713	1	a	This is a fun game.
1390	1	a	This is like a drug. Murder simulation, the sound is probably the best thing about this game. The first time you fire a simple 6.5mm round you realize this game is on a completely different level from anything else. Some games can be more fun, but none are more real. Sometimes you'll have memories of killing people on certain maps and you'll wake up in the morning and remember it, that place you went to and that person you killed. Genuinely a feeling of disconnection will grow when you play other games because you don't feel like they properly exteriorize a sense of realism compared to ARMA 3. The sunlight is like video game wizardry i'll never understand. Closing this review i'll say you should have confidence in yourself, play the multiplayer from the start, switch your rate of fire, run and kill kill kill.
500	1	a	worth Â£40 not much else to say.
5379	0	a	I HATE THIS! every time I attempt to accses a server or game im always transfared back to the main title server screen due to 'unknown errors'/ error code : 0x0000DEAD- why to I have to deal with this every time I try to connect to a server... Â£14.99 wasted, thanks....!!!!
3560	1	a	Not as good as ArmA 2.
1522	1	a	Have you ever felt like running 4km with 40kg of gear only to get shot from 1km away? Have you ever felt like balancing 24 different factors before firing a single shot in an FPS? Have you ever felt like knifing noobs just doesn't cut it anymore? (pun intended) If you answered yes to any of these questions, you may need treatment in the form of Arma 3, an open-world, simulation FPS. Arma 3 (short for Arma 3) is the crux of over a decade of refinement by one of the most dedicated development teams out there - and it shows. Visually, it is stunning (of course depending on specs), aurally it is surreal, and when it comes to RPing and simulation, there is no better option (except maybe VBS made by the same people; but that costs $$$$$ and is used by actual armies so yeah maybe not...). Need more incentive? As well as a dev team that updates news for the fan base weekly and is STILL improving the game (and plans to continue doing so), there is also the modding commmunity for Arma - which is second to none. Arma 3 can literally be anything you want it to be - even a taco. 11/10 would die 12,008 times again.
4579	1	a	Best army game 10/10
3351	1	a	4 reasons to buy ArmA III.  1. I looked at the horizon and saw a Hemmt going to space, I had to double-check if I wasn't playing any space related games.  2. A guy hitted the brakes and got thrown out of his car.  3. A medic was driving on the mainroad, I heard his sirenes when suddenly BOOM, an offroad flew through the sky a moment later.  4. Freaking people using Go-Karts as rocket proppelant.  100/10 Altis Space Program
4648	1	a	Great game with a lot of potential to be something more than it is, unfortunately the game engine sucks. After more than 2000 hours on arma 2 and 3, its still the number one complaint. Maybe they'll get right one day?  If you like Mil sims, get this. This isn't like COD, you won't be doing any 360 no scopes. You may be running to get into position for over and hour to get to your objective and for that one chance of a shot. Tactics is a must, there is no god mode. Do anything stupid and you will be punished severely.  7/10. (would be 10/10 if they had a better engine)
2747	1	a	Its a very good game! Specialy the Altis life mode on some server! Great Game!!!!!
4316	1	a	'One. Engage that man. Half a klick.' 'Oh no. One is down. Fall back.' Has some fish A.I, too. 
2486	1	a	Alot of strategy involved in this game. I bought this game because I knew it would have great mods, and I was right. King of the hill is such a basic mod but it sure is really addictive.
4929	1	a	lITTLE BUGGY, BUT GREAT FUN.
4323	1	a	Easily the most fun game I have ever played. Hands down. There is literally nothing you can't do with this game. Wanna play stock? OK. Like Zombies? Theres a MOD for that. Wanna make your own missions? There a MOD for that. More weapons? MOD. Like other people? Multiplayer. Hate other people? Solo. Wanna RP? There are servers for that.   Damn, this game just has everything!
424	1	a	It's a very good game. It's had manny issues with performance, requieres a processor with a really good single core performance, but it's a damn good title.  It recently had a performance update, FPS went from unacceptable low with an i7 4790k and a gtx 970 to more than playable within one single patch. It's a shame the patch wasn't released earlier, as I've had a negative review for almost two years. Finaly the game runs at least somewhat decent.  It's a slower paced shooter, with a steep learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, it's a damn good game. The community is generally friendly, helpful towards newer players and more mature than in other games, but you will still meet idiots and jerks every now and then.  I've played it for almost 1000 hours and I still havn't grown sick of it, ther'es just so much content and mods available. It's a game well worth buying, as long as you know what you buy you won't be dissapointed.
487	1	a	Very tactical team based game!
1020	1	a	this is a game that feels like you're playing something special, up until something actually happens, and then in true bohemia fashion you clip through a building while vaulting or something and die; at which point you close the game because â¥â¥â¥â¥
1711	1	a	this game was fun and stuff. it also smelled good.
439	1	a	I have always been a fan of military simulation. The base game which offers co-op mode is already challenging as the AI sometimes can be very skilful. The amount of times you die is insane; in a chopper on the way to mission, fire fight with the AI and stepping on landmines etc.  ARMA 3 community is generally helpful and what keeps us playing is the game's ability to install add-ons and mods. They really can bring your alter-ego to life.
1588	1	a	Helicopter DLC overpriced
95	1	a	Hard not to be overly fanboiÂ´ish or hateful on this iteration of the game.   My best advice: DonÂ´t believe the pictures. Read up on the game first. And itÂ´s not a casual shooter.
66	1	a	You can go through one whole hour of combat, with bullets blazing, without managing to spot a single enemy nor shoot a single shot. Hands down the best combat simulator there is.
1245	1	a	Yeah it's not half bad.
2065	1	a	If you can think it arma has it
4609	1	a	First time playing arma was unexpected to say the least. Classic king of the hill match. Im apart of a team of SIX guys in a ghost hawk with some stanger that came along. We enter the AO in the heli. We begin taking fire from both sides. One shot takes out the back roter. All you hear is JUMP NOW! Only 3 of my group jump out and the rest blow up in the air. I land in a tree and my two other group members are no where to be found. We meet up only to be BLOWN UP by a nade.   12/10 Nades
5111	0	a	I really want to love Arma, but I just cant bring myself to. It's the most realistic game ever, and it has probably a lifetimes worth of content. Beautiful graphics and the complexity of the gameplay isn't actually all that daunting once you get used to it. But thats not the problem. The problem is the dog-dirt AI. Its seriously the worst AI I have ever seen in a video game, EVER. I actually cannot describe how awful it is.   Should you attempt to use AI to help you drive a vehicle, God have mercy on your soul. Try and be the gunner? The driver is going to do his best to run into walls and flip the tank in a ditch. See an enemy? Well then he is going to turn the tank around, expose the weak rear armor, and stop in an open field. Tell him to move? Nope, suddenly they forgot how to obey commands and do a weird back and forth jerking roll thing. Try and be the driver? The gunner in a tank with thermal optics will somehow miss a tank sitting 3 feet in front of him. Your infantry teammates will engage the enemy by breaking cover, running into the middle of the street, and spraying on full auto. Vehicles constantly get stuck on rocks, lampposts, trees, ditches, ect. Sometimes they won't spot an enemy in the open while they are being used as target practice, and other times they pull of aimbot level first-shot headshots from 500m while standing upright. Helicopters and planes are more effective as kamikaze weapons, and single enemies with rifles can easily take out a wing of attack helos.   I really really want to love this game, but its virtually impossible to enjoy with AI teammates. I have every AI enhancement mod I can find, nothing helps. Every time I come back to it I get so mad. Whether its my M1 driver stopping in an open field and then un-learning how to drive so we can be RPG fodder or my gunner in an apache refusing to engage enemy infantry in the open leading to an early demise, the AI in this game is insanely poor. It makes the AI out of battlefield 2 look like rocket science. AI able to take the initiative and get in a technicals .50 without being specifically ordered to approach the vehicle, and then you having to get in and switch spots for 10 minutes to finagle them out of a passenger seat into the obviously useful position is a pipe dream in this game. Its super enjoyable to walk around and play in Zeus mode, but unless you have great internet you are going to get very, very, very upset.
47	1	a	Do I recommend this game? I do. I really do.  It's like masterpiece of music or artwork. You can make beautiful colonies, great armies and great battles. It's not about accuracy, but about tactic, strategy. You need to get resources as fast as possible, get units and destroy your enemy. Simple, but hard, since different nation has different bonuses. So far I loved France and Portugal. France for unique settlers, which are strong and gather faster than usual settlers. Voltigeurs and Gandarmes are strong together. Advanced formation for Gandarmes recommended. (able to turn on in gameplay options)  Portugal is... just beautiful. I love the language and voices they have. Cassadores are powerful long-range units with cute voice. Organ guns are ideal against infantry. Jinetes (dragoons) are hardcore enemies for cavarly, so use 'em to keep your artillery safe from enemy's horses. There maybe hard choice for pikemen or halbardies, but imo pikemen are way more useful, even if weaker. I work with 45 Cassadores and 5 Heavy Cannons (also +1 for voice) which are powerful formation, but also weak. So I used to work with weaker (low hp) units, but faster and more powerful. Rathauses (or how do you call it) are a bit annoying, since if you want to build beautiful looking colony, 3 rathauses are enough imo.  Even tho price may not be very convincing, spend money on this (or wait for sale, it's always an option) and have fun. Company is fun either.
3964	1	a	Love it! Though I wish I had a better graphics card (gt 750m).
570	1	a	Spending enough time in this game to fully appreciate the good and the bad, I have decided to put some words down. I love this game more than any other game that comes to mind.  Where do I start? I'll start with the hard stuff.  You will stuggle with this game. You will have moments where you hate the way it's coded. You will die to stupid things, like stairs or rocks. You will hate the fatigue system and the weapon sway. You will get annoyed at the reskins for outfits.  Eventually, you will mod it.  This is not a simple run and gun game. You will not find yourself 'no scoping' after sprinting for 2 kliks. Arma 3 is a simulator first and a game second. The groundwork is solid for the most part. The modding community is devoted. The game modes are varied. There is something that almost everyone will find appealing inside this package.  Halo jumping dressed like the UK Special Forces? Check. Thank a modder. Driving a hatchback that's colored like the American flag? Check. Thank a modder. Want to build a mission around the Tet Offensive? Check. Thank a modder.  Am I biased? Yes. Do I have a huge amount of respect for modders? Yes.  Arma 3 is a cpu intensive game. You will have to tweek the hell out of it to make it just right. You aren't going to get 60 fps on poorly coded MP servers. Please don't think it's your hardware, it's not. Well, probably not. But this game really shines in the graphic department once she's setup just right. I'm constantly trying to squeeze as much performance as possible, but I'm not going to go over everything I've done, it would take too long. If you google it, you will find it.  Playing the game by yourself is hindering your fun to an extent I can't even explain. Ok, since you asked so nicely, I'll try.  Playing to campaign alone left me yearning for more. I really disliked the interface when assigning targets, or handing out orders to the AI squadmates I had been shackled with. It doesn't feel very fluid, nor does it give me the feeling of teamwork. The AI, at times, can go 'full â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥' and just stand there while being mowed down by the enemy forces. You may order them to get into the truck you're sitting in, only to find one of them has the great idea to run right into the AO and alert everyone to your presence. Ok, I guess stealth is off the table. At least I have superior numbers? Ha, they won't get out of the truck and that rpg is headed this way. I'll just reload my save then.  Now, replay that with real people that communicate and know how to play. Completely different outcome. I'm not typing that hypothetical situation out again, just trust me.  Now, onto the really fun part. That part that makes my genitals tingle.   The Mods.  OMG Becky, look at those mods. They're so big! No, they aren't all large downloads. Even some of the smallest mods can change the game to a large extent.  Take AGM for example. It has different frag throwing options. A medical system that includes epi's, blood bags, adrenaline and the ability to drag people to safety. No longer can you see how many rounds are left in your mag, you can only 'see' the weight. It has weapon resting, fast roping, cook offs, vehicle repair options and a bunch of other things I can't think off.  What about vehicles? I really like the hummvees from Arma 2. There are a few different options for mods for that. Do you hate that you stop moving when you switch weapons? There's a mod for that. Tactical glasses have no use in the game? There's a mod that gives you a hud when wearing the glasses in first person. I hate the stock sounds. JSRS3 baby! Want a Canadian mohawk? Reskin mod. Tired of playing Altis or Stratis? Bornholm, Tilos, Chernobyl, Chernarus, Utes, Panthera. Just to name a few of the many user made maps available with a few clicks.  Be warned. Mods don't always work 'right out of the boxâ¢'. If you don't have patience, you're just going to have a bad time. Sometimes mods don't work well with each other, or give you graphical errors, or aren't compatible with user made missons. In short, when they work, oh baby do they. When they don't, you deal with it or stop using them.  Look, I'm biased. I really am. I love the milsim aspect of this game. I love the squad play. I love the vehicles and the guns. I love the guys I play with.  They say that the best things in life are the things you have to work for. That's what Arma 3 is.  You have to work for it. But it really shines in the long run.
3914	1	a	Good game but there is no shotguns :(
3010	1	a	I'm going to play this on my intel HD 4400! Said no one... ever...
3260	1	a	Probably the world's most realistic Military FPS. So many tactics can be used at any given moment, along with an endless arsenal of weapons and vehicles. Create your own story with the scenario editor, play with friends in Online, retake Stratis in the Campaign, or play a custom scenario game. If you like realistic modern shooters that have a squad/platoon system and would rather take orders from players instead of a pushy AI. Then this masterpiece is for you!
4696	1	a	well can i get my friend this game for free cause he really wants it he has to walk 1k to his friends house so yeah  
1834	1	a	10 out of 10 would Arma III forever.
4578	1	a	This game is the â¥â¥â¥â¥. If you haven't played it, then you should probably save your money instead of buying cases in CS:GO. Only problem I have is that the game is only optimized for Intel Processors, so basically anyone who bought a AMD processor is screwed. With a team as big as they have, you would think they would work on it. Especially for all the people who spent money on this game, but never got to experience it as they should have.
2860	1	a	Life? what life. My life is gone. One of the best games to date. Watch yaself a youtube vid then make your self a mission or jump onto a server with 100 other people and die from lag. But you will stall keep coming back for more.  
2128	1	a	Good game would buy again.... 10/10 ign                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I like chicken butts
3185	1	a	Hey, that's pretty good.  *Edit* RIP life
5113	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ developers who add DLC into the game which you cant use untill you buy them. Such a foul move to get players to have to buy their dlcs..   Back in my days, dlc were for free. :(
4477	1	a	Can't recommend it more, try it out!
2938	1	a	If you want a tactical game it's a game for you
4122	1	a	Children play Call of Duty Boys play Battlefield  Men play ARMA
4963	1	a	I've been running for an hour in this game

5058	0	a	Bohemia engine.... enough said.
2461	1	a	Best military sandbox out there. This is not just a game. It is a playground where you can wage war in any shape or form (with great graphics btw):  -Use land, water and air vehicles.  -Control a team.  -Use UAV's and stationary weapons.  -Play through immense maps from arma 3, arma 2 and others (like the new Bornholm). -Use gameplay mods that change drastically the way the game is played (Wasteland, Epoch, Life, Hunger games...) -The Zeus mode will let you create and edit any part of the game on the fly (be a god). -The list goes on and on.  The only thing that is not as polished as in other AAA war games is the cinematics, this is more a simlulator kind of game. But then, it's like comparing a toy car and a toy car made out of lego. Take it apart, put it together and you'll have a completely different toy.  Just to finish: DayZ came out of this concept (in arma 2). What else do you need to know?
750	1	a	Arma 3 is hands down one of the best war simulator/games that I have ever played!!! If you just want to run and gun then this game is not for you, maybe COD or Battlefield is something more suited for you, but if you are looking for a full immersion into what war is really like, then Arma 3 is the game that you want.. or the game that you need!! Arma 3 has hundreds upon hundreds of different mods and scenarios that you can play so that you are never bored. With mods like Battle Royale, Breaking Point(DayZ) and King of The Hill you will find yourself playing for hours upon hours!!
2361	1	a	An undeniably accurate military simulator, no other game like it (yes, COD boys and BF fans, this is very different indeed). Developed by actual military personel, this game is designed to be as realistic to military combat, tactics, and realismas humanly possible. I've played ArmA II for years and never did I imagine a game, designed for the sole purpose of military simulations, take on the challenge of becomeing a modern day platform of ArmA III.
2273	1	a	Good Sim where all mistakes are punished by death.
32	1	a	Good points of Age of Empires III:  Good unit diversity: Each civ has a core of units semi-unique to them, making each one feel different enough that playing the Germans doesn't feel like a playing a reskin of the British, or vice versa. For the 'European Civs' (I put that in quotes because while the Ottoman Turks are not from Europe at all, they play like one of the other European civs), that diversity is actually rather subtle, with each civ having one or two units totally unique to them, as well as a couple semi-universal units that are their 'Best Units', which get special high-tier upgrades. For example, while the Spanish get Hussars, like the British, the British can upgrade them to 'Kingsguard' Hussars, while the Spanish just get regular 'Guard' Hussars. The distinction is rather intuitive; basically, if a unit gets a special name once it hits its second upgrade, it'll be better in some way than a unit that doesn't. In this way, the European civs harken back, somewhat, to Age of Empires II, which had each civ only have one or two unique units. On the other hand, each of the Native American and Asian civs are completely different, with entirely different units and even different mechanics, and which units each civ is best with is fairly obvious a few minutes into playing them. The diversity is further enhanced with mercenary units available from the home city and native american units from trading posts.  Good story campaigns: I can't quite make this point without clarification. The first three campaigns were not that great. Those were the pre-expansion ones, and frankly, the series had really stopped working out those storytelling muscles it had in Age of Empires II. The action often felt disjointed and rushed, with the endings of each of the three campaigns being the only bits that seemed to matter or have any impact. However, all of that said, the latter five campaigns were actually quite good, especially if you could disengage them from the taint of their predecessors in terms of tropes and pacing. In addition, the characters personal struggles in the latter five campaigns were more apparent, their inner struggles seemed to mean so much more. Really, if you want a great story, the latter five campaigns are pretty damn good.  Good* Mechanics: This game has some rather... mixed mechanics. I'll get to the bad later, but for now, the good news! The home city is the big thing that was touted on release, and frankly, I like the concept a lot. It allows a player to gain advantages specific to their strategy, whether it be resource gathering, naval dominance, or raw military power. Essentially, the way the Home City works is that the player assigns cards to a deck, each card representing a batch of units or an upgrade or some resources. When a home city shipment is available in game, the player selects one of the cards they've assigned, and after a brief waiting period (Hey, it takes time to get a Declaration to Claim the New World overseas. Cut them some slack.), the units, tech, etc. arrives. In addition to this as one of the primary mechanics, you've got your normal suite of resource gathering (done with villager-type units) and military unit production. An interesting nuance of the unit production here is that when you've got a military building selected, let's say, the Barracks, and let's say you want to train a sqaud of Musketeers. You can shift-click the unit portrait to train five at once. While this may not seem novel by itself; a few games already allow this sort of thing, the novel thing is that doing it this way makes the waiting period for your units slightly longer, but you get all five units at once. The Russians and Chinese have this as their primary mechanic, with the Russians training 'blocks' of infantry, and the Chinese creating 'Banner Armies' which are groups of various unit combinations. Overall, the mechanics are decent in most respects. In addition, the game very cleverly and subtley hampers rushing, which was a brutal, and often severely effective tactic in Age of Empires II, by making it so that the player cannot send units from the home city, or even train them, until the second technological era. I hardly ever notice that my efforts at building an army are being hampered by this restriction, but when I do notice it, I am appreciative of the clever design choice.  Bad points of Age of Empires III:  Bad* Mechanics: As I said, this game has some mixed mechanics. Now we come to the bad. The primary problem we have here is that while the home city, is in concept, a nice idea with some potential for strategic use, it seems best used as a rush enabler. Earlier, I mentioned that the game restricts rushing by limiting military units to the second age and following. But the home city can easily be stocked with military unit shipments so that come second era, you can get an entire army, virtually free of charge. Here's a hot tip for those cheese players out there: Get the best second-era military unit shipments you can. Then, in game, save up your shipments. Once you get to age II, build a Church. Then research Mercantilism, which gets you around 3 shipments for 1,000 Coin. Then, in essence, spawn a horde of troops. Admittedly, this really only works for the European civs, but the overwhelming potential for early-midgame rush is still somewhat staggering, and it means that some of the more interesting home city shipments may not ever see play. In addition, many games, it seems, are decided well before the final technological era. The reasons for this are two-fold: A) Reaching that final era and researching all the upgrades is simply prohibitively expensive, and B) It just makes more sense to strike your enemy before then, fatally, if possible. This makes the late-game content feel a little unnecessary, as you're probably already winning if you can research that final era, and if you're not winning, spending 4,000 food and coin isn't going to make things that much better. The game does mitigate this somewhat, by having a 'Revolution' feature, an alternative to the final age-up, which turns all your villager-type units into militia-type units, and also gives you a plethora of new military options for your civ. However, if you're far ahead enough that you can forgo economy entirely, than you probably don't need the feature anyway. Also, it's only available to European civs, so the final age cost problem is still relevant to Asian and Native American civs. Also, unit counters and stats can be difficult to wrap one's head around, as the developers saw fit to give the player the literal math used to determine unit stats. For example, I believe the movement speed for the average footsoldier was 7.25. Not 7, not 8, but a fraction, 7.25. While this may not seem like a major issue, throwing numbers like that at a player makes the game feel less than polished, and also degrades the meaning of the numbers themselves. 7.25 what? And what does it mean when my Musketeer deals 8 damage, but the Hussar it's attacking has 0.20 armor? Does it deflect 0.20 damage? Or 20% damage? The game doesn't tell you, meaning you'll have to examine the numbers closely to determine exact impact of your units against your opponents.  Anachronism: While I will be the first to admit that anachronism in a strategy game isn't that huge an issue, and is in fact, almost to be expected in these kinds of games, the situation here is rather glaring. Granted, the problem is bigger in the first three story campaigns, and I wouldn't mind it quite so much if it were restricted to the game itself only. But c'mon. Having Revolutionary War era musketeers accompany Amelia Black, a railroad owner? And having them in full garb in cutscene? That's the sort of thing that stretches disbelief to the breaking point, and was one of the reasons that those campaigns did not match the quality of the latter five.  Overall Review: It's pretty good. Steam's char. limits are â¥â¥â¥.
2032	1	a	Better than I expected, Conflicts are pretty good. You won't get bored while you are experiencing Arma 3. However, It's different then any other Action game since it includes a lot of details in it in general. It's pretty worth it.
1287	1	a	Sometimes me and my friend would make little prison camps for civies and crash jets into it to slowly kill them off. I know we are tAIRable people.  Oh yeah and the games good too.
4521	1	a	This is the best Army-Stratgy-War game you will ever find trust me. you NEED to GET THIS
4388	1	a	Apex make Arma great again!
5116	0	a	Some background: I first started playing Bohemia Interactive games in 2001, when I played the demo for Operation Flashpoint from a Computer Gaming World disk. I owned all of the Operation Flashpoint expansions, as well as ARMA II, and now ARMA III.  This game sucks sh*t. All of them have, and all of them have depended on the addons to make the game playable. BI Has never made a decent game, only a platform with promise that modders/mission makers polish up.  -I don't know why BI continues to make storylines, they've always been awful at them. -AI sucks. I just fired up a mission and was told to plant explosives on some mobile artillery. The Platoon Leader said 'and everyone else take cover'.. apparently a couple AI thought it best to run towards the mobile artillery, so I accidently killed them ---leading to a mission failure, and them shooting at me.  -Before that two soldiers got killed running off on their own (funny, never saw that in the Ranger Handbook) -Most multiplayer servers with a decent ping are either RPG or DM... I should not have to explain why this is stupid.  +Voice acting gets slightly less terrible each game. +Graphics are decent  I don't recommend getting this unless it's like 75% off and you understand what you're getting. 
551	1	a	Great game, amazing gameplay and visually fantastic. One thing to know about this game before you buy it. It is not COD. If you're looking for a game like that, dont buy this... 
1271	0	a	cant join any server, i can get easily to lobby, but when i try to connect and it loads up ll the missiondata, it just puts me back to main menu when its finished loading... tried so many things, reinstalled serveral times, deleted eerything and reinstalled but nothing worked for me and it seems that im currently the only one who has this problem..
18	1	a	Though many people say AOE2 is the best in the franchise, I actually think AOE3, with the abundance of exotic civs from 2 expansions and unofficial mods, has surpassed that timeless classic.  Graphics: AOE3 looks great at distance, even up to today's standards. That's mainly due to the excellent using of lighting effects (shades and HDR), the textures and animation on a closer look however, are on the same level as Age of Mythology (kinda obvious they used the same engine), which is a little bit dated. But it doesn't hurt at all, for some of the best RTS games like SupCom and COH aren't beautiful up close either.  Sound: Soundtracks are awesome, definitely the best in the franchise and probably one of the best in the whole genre. I especially love the track of revolution event, it pumps me up so much that I want to punch a freaking baby in the face. Sound effects are even more impressive, more so the sound of canons. God how I love the sound of canon fire in this game, every shot is like the mixture of bass solo and Morgan Freeman monologue coming out of a subwoofer. Pure heaven.  Gameplay: Quite different from the previous games. The tempo has been speeded up a bit. Range attack becomes the mainstream and melee the sidekick. Resources are down to 3, which I think is acceptable. Civs feel very distinct from each other especially those from different continents. Balance is marginally okay, with 3 pretty OP civs and same amount of trench tier ones. Many new features like homecity and card deck building are actually great fun and add a lot to the strategic depth. Online games are quite stable and smooth, and usually end in stomping.  Mods: I love the mod Napoleonic Era to death. This along with another mod called The War of the Triple Alliance make me rate this game among top 3 RTS on my list. Holy crap the additional civs and features are mindblowing. I really wish for 2 things, that we will one day get Steam Workshop for AOE3 and one day the devs of these two mods be contracted by Microsoft to combine the mods into an official expansion, just like The Forgotten to AOE2.   Community: Friendly, steady, small in size but alive. That's all I can say.  Conclusion: Don't let nostalgia get the best of you. AOE3 is different from AOE2, but in a good way.
3941	1	a	Excelent game if u like making plays
2853	1	a	i played it, as a steam trial, so it was pretty good
4619	1	a	I highly recommend Arma 3 if you're into Army games with a (high) sense of realism. You can make this game as awesome as you want yourself. Depending on which (modded) gamemodes you play or with who you're playing. I'm part of one of the largest Arma 3 clans out there (Joint Task Force 2) and it really adds to the experience, having a Tactical Realism based clan. Think of stuff like Basic Training, military rank structure, working with a chain of command, teamplay based on military tactics and manoeuvers etc.  check us out over at  www.jointtaskforce2.com

865	1	a	Really well built game! They certainly did not disapoint with this one!!
1968	1	a	This game is awesome, picked it up in steam summer sale, started playing a week later. 100 hours in, bought DLC, killed lots of zombies, sniped lots of people and had lots of laughs. Pull the trigger on it commander, its really good. RIP LYF? Roger that.
384	0	a	Oh ArmA. ArmA, ArmA, ArmA. The abusive relationship we have shared over the past 4 games has become more abusive, and less fun, and all it took was one title. One title full of empty promises, and most likely just a tech demo to fix the engine up for DayZ 2. Let me elaborate on my disdain for what used to be one of my favorite game series, and the company that I used to respect above every other.  The quick and dirty, would I recommend ArmA 3? Not by a mile. Sub-30 price tag, sure, you'll get your monies worth. But even for all the modders trying to save it, this is not a complete game. You should not have to pay 60 dollars to go and download a number of COMMUNITY created additions to feel like you actually have a full fledged product. If some of that money went to those modders, then I'd say support THEM, not BI. But it doesn't. Imagine buying a car, but having to go out and purchase the doors and steering wheel separately. Sure the car runs, but just how useable is it?  A quick glance at my steam page would reveal that I highly praised BI's adventurous approach to ArmA 2, and OA. I loved ArmA with a blazing passion, even though it's considered the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ of the series. OFP shared a warm place in my heart as the birth of one of my favorite mil-sims. Sure, since OFP, the series has had its caveats and nuances, but you quickly learned to take them with the massive amount of fun the games provided. So where did ArmA 3 go wrong? What could one title do to tear my respect for 3 other games (+ 2 Expansions &amp; DLC)? Well, lets start with the company and work our way up. You see, riding on the heels of the massive success that DayZ was thanks to word of mouth and LPs, BI somewhere seems to have got it in their head that the same business practices most AAA companies do (Incomplete Games for Full Price, DLC strategies), could be done to their small communities. And you know what? They were right. We all bought into it. BI slowly came to realize that they could do less work, and still make more money, because their communities could turn nowhere else. What amazes me most about DayZ, besides the fact that it is still in Alpha after almost 2 years, and that it's lead creator left, is that all it really did was show what ArmA 2 was already capable of. Massive, persistent worlds with Mil-Sim themes. Just, with zombies.  But, this is not a review of DayZ, this a review of ArmA 3. Any ArmA community member worth his or her grain of salt will remember all the broken promises that now lay at ArmA 3's feet. Disguising as the enemy? Gone. The Railgun tank, one of the coolest features at E3, and the only one making the future worth giving a damn about? Poof. All the underwater showcases, hinting at perhaps real naval gameplay? Nope. Planes? We got 3. Funny thing is, all you Deluxe Edition owners should open up that Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures manual it comes with sometime, and view all the planes we should have had. The reskinned C-130 and F-35? Fugetta about it. That's right, we couldn't even get recycled content.  Now, let me be fair, ArmA 3's engine is a massive improvement over previous series entries. And OFP/ArmA has always been one of those games where the community really takes it the final step with endless content. But Vanilla, the games were usually very playable, and very enjoyable. This is where ArmA 3 comes up the shortest. While the engine is great, and getting better with each patch, not only are we still denied even a basic amount of content, but the underlying issues since OFP are still there. 2013/2014, we still have an action menu. BI, please. Not to mention that AI has somehow found a way to get worse with all these improvements, rather than better.  You know, some people actually say ArmA 2 people were spoiled because we had OFP and ArmA 1's content all rolled into one. I find it hard to give sympathy to the people whose job it is to create content and games. Who get paid for it. In closing I will say this. ArmA 3, as a game, is complete and total BS. ArmA 3, as a platform, for people to show their skills in modeling, texturing, and coding, fantastic. If you want ArmA 3, do it to support people who make great content. Just don't expect a full fledged game, for the full fledged price.
3645	1	a	10/10 would spend hundreds of hours on game again
2898	1	a	An extremely large amount of stuff to do in many extremely large environments. Campaign, multiplayer, roleplaying, co-op, side-ops, helicopters, tanks, lots of other vehicles including go-karts, bullet-dropping, weather, wind, wildlife, etc. I had not played the campaign yet, so I cannot say it is good or not, but the game itself and all the content is worth what ever it is priced now.
5198	1	a	The Single Player is alright, but multiplayer is the â¥â¥â¥â¥ in this game.   Life Mods/Battle Royale/Wasteland/King of the Hill are all incredibly fun.    Main issues: VERY high system requirements, low frames in altis multiplayer on even the best PCs  6/10 Single Player 9/10 Multiplayer
39	1	a	Already better than no mans sky.
5119	0	a	Trailer explain this is game actually is still under devellopment. They are basically looking for players to play this game to actually test the game and server stability and more. Buy game? Not yet.
3313	1	a	this game is awesome buy it. you won't regret
3882	1	a	This game is THE GAME.
2485	1	a	one of the best games ive played
2015	1	a	Still dont know how to fly a plane  10/10
3389	1	a	Totally worth it both for SP and for MP. Especially for MP.
661	1	a	Drove a car over chicken wire. Car broke. 10/10 would drive over chicken wire again
3324	1	a	This game is really good.
4092	1	a	time to put on your big boy pants
2550	1	a	I am a huge shooter fan. You name it and I have played it....from CS 1.6 to HALO to Advanced Warfare. The ARMA series has always been one of my favorite. There truely is nothing else like it. Played with the right group of people in a co-op server and next thing you know 4 hours have gone by. I love this game.
4788	1	a	I couldn't reccommend this game anymore if i tried. It is very fun, very replayable, and intense at times. The Zeus addition to the real time editing of scenarios has made this so much better tahn arma 2 its practically silly. The modding community is as good as it has always been maybe even better. There is plenty of servers and people to play with etc... Go buy it!! nowwwww!!! :p
1363	1	a	Probably the greatest FPS game ever created. Completely unlike all other FPS (COD, BF etc) though. Awesome graphics, awesome gameplay and awesome realism.
1596	1	a	A aerfectly simulated warfare sandbox which you can discover on foot, in vehicles, in the air and under sea. Whatever is your thing - cooperative teamplay, PVP madness or simply doing missions on your own. ARMA 3 offers you all this and thanks to a superb modding community and constant iterations by the developer, you will never run out of things to do or try out. Forget about CoD, forget about Battlefield, this is not a shooter, this is war.
230	1	a	Take Arma 2, fix the bugs, give it some of the best graphics in gaming, and you get Arma 3, once more modders get stuck into this game it will be a must have for sure.
5319	0	a	waste of freaking money. the game runs like crap, the aiming freaking sucks and theres freaking invisible enemies that can kill you even though yoju cant see them. worst game ever i regret buying this piece of crap!
1712	1	a	Great game, hours of fun.   limitless play time with innumerous mods
1263	1	a	One of the best military sim out there. I have over 1000 hrs on this game and still counting. This game has a variety of gamemodes and community made gamemodes like King Of The Hill, Wasteland etc. This game even features realistic bullet ballistics and full moding suppert. And speaking of mods. There are TONS AND TONS of mods outthere that enchanes sound and game mechanics and AI improvent. Though there is some small optimation problems with the game its a 10/10 GET THIS GAME
4182	0	a	so i want to play online however most need apex so im like ok lets see how much it is but i come to find out it cost a little less than the game its self.If you are looking to play online only get this if you are willing to buy both apex and the games its self and not to mention alot of the severs also need some of the other ones.
2576	1	a	Great servers to play on, but it is not optimized very well.
3884	1	a	its... something
3270	1	a	10/10 would get blown up a good few times again. But in all seriousness, this game has a couple of flaws (the performance in online servers is a tad weird at times) this game is one of the best things I've played in a LONG time. You see, this game has so much depth it's unbelievable. There are so many weapons and realistic vehicles that are so realistic you feel like you're really on the frontlines of a battlefield. To be honest, it's more of a simulator than anything else. It's worth the Â£20 just for the entertainment value and the laughs you get on some of the online modes. That's not mentioning this is probably the best map in video game history. Don't expect this game to be easy either - elements of tactfullness and patience are very much needed much like a real world frontline scenario! Hands down the best FPS on the market right now; hands down beats any C.O.D. or Battlefield game! PLEASE buy it if you don't have it!
3210	1	a	Amazing game with many biggest mods!!
2336	1	a	It's ok, kinda laggy, hopefully they optomize for mid-end computers in the future.
137	1	a	Love this game! This is one of the best games in the OFP/Arma series, I've already built a WarMod for it for the IFA3 mod, and 2 more WarMods i will be building for it soon. The Eden editor which is the 3d editor imo is the highlight of the game, yes theres a ton of missions, campaigns, MODS, other functions, &amp; features, scripts, codes, textures, sounds, tools, ............................ the list goes on and on, theres so many genre's of mods in this game I wonder why anyone buys other games.  The greatest thing is the community is massive, the forums are always busy the Developers are always updating fixing and adding new features, functions as well as new content sometimes, I cant recall how many times this game has been updated since its Alpha release but I think theres no other game out there that has been patched and updated like Arma3 has. Sure people will have their issues and dislikes about the game, i think every game has that. Arma3 has a high learnign curve it depends but its not limited to what is listed or what it gives you, its a very diverse, in depth, open ended, sandbox, theres so much content you can play with, so many things you can do, and create that you will get more for  your money then any other game imo. I would highly suggest that you run it with a quad core, and a decent GPU, plenty of ram, for example I have a duel core, 8gb of ram, Nvidia GTx 750ti, 850watt PSU, i average 30-35fps in what i play, CPU is the biggest thing if you can afford an upgrade upgrade the cpu above all things.  I been in the OFP/Arma series since it started and compared to the editor in the previous games, the editor in A3 is the best, it has so many features and functions and isnt that hard to learn how to create a simple mission, like in the previous games you can play your mission in the editor.  For maps which are what you play your missions on, Arma3 comes with 2 maps, they are.....MASSIVE and has tons of details, amazing work, for more maps I highly reccomend a mod called CUP Terrains CUP stands for Community Upgrade project it adds all the maps from the arma2/OA games as well as new ones in arma3! Among other things like all the infantry weapons, tanks, vehicles, and other stuff. Also there are several major popular mods for zombies for those of you who are into zombies, survival, looting like in DayZ ect,. its all there theres something for everyone in this game.  You want to play     serious military realism     Post-Apoctylyptic Zombies, lands, scenerio, and horror survival     be the Russians and kill ISIS     as the Bundswehr army     with Aliens, Dinosaurs, monsters, space, Halo     SP, MP, COOP     Realism units, clans, groups     WW2 - Iron front in Arma3, Pacific Theater, Western Front, British Germans, Russians, Italians     Code, script, textures, models, create new factions, mods, missions, campaigns, weapons, cars, tanks, jets, planes     fly in fighter jets, propelled planes, commercial jets, tourist planes     at night, underwater as a scuba diver, Halo parachute, hang gliding just explore     RTS, be a commander, a lone soldier, squad leader, give orders, be a medic, engineer, driver, pilot, machine gunner     kill terrorists, be a terrorist, be an assassin, a lone sniper, sharpshooter, a police officer, marine, army, airborne,navy     special forces, silenced, blow up stuff -things, vehicles, buildings, people, anywhere!     like an arcade, military simulation, rpg, rts, modern, WW2, Vietnam, Sci Fi, zombies, survival,racing     make a lot of friends and meet alot of interesting intelligent people!     you can do all that! Idk what else to say buy it its worth every dime, even better on sale ;) If you ever need help with the game or resources, need help getting started, want to know about mods, how to install stuff where to find stuff, either catch me on BIS forums or send me a friend invite. Cheers! :)
4193	0	a	The Singleplayer CAN be fun. The graphics Options are pretty good, if you have a bad PC you can edit it very well. But Multiplayer is Very bad, i got the game for Multiplayer and its a Disaster, i cant even connect and when i join it says: Mission failed... I might be a noob. But i dont recommend the game.
241	1	a	Even if its not on sale, probably one of the best games on the market. Infinite replay value. Must have.
4653	1	a	+
2210	1	a	Military Simulation. Great game and mod-able to ensure its long lasting life. Best series i've ever played.  *update*  Joined on EU server. Spawned as Recon Paramedic. Got some objective to take a town. Bought some explosive because recon. Secondary objective is to blow up a radio tower surrounded with mines. Engineer goes first. Got some mines deactivated, planted a c4 and a satchel charge. Engineer got shot. A machine gunner tries to get the engineer out of the mine field. Detonated a mine. A rifle man tries the same thing. History repeats. 18 other tries. *no joke* History repeats. I, as a medic, heroically patched up 2 guys in the middle of the mine field while getting shot at #idiot. Planted the explosive on the tower. Tries to patch the engineer back up which he's on the other side of the tower. Some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ following me stepped on a mine. Goes down. Some random epic man runs across the minefield detonating half of the mine. Dieded. Whole server laugh. Got patched up. Cant detonate the satchel i was planted. Whole team of 15 people including a helicopter and a tank fired at and thrown grenades including smoke grenade for some reason to the radio tower. Radio tower dont give a â¥â¥â¥â¥. Some guy said it was a beginning of a bad joke. Unexpected CAS at radio tower. *because some dude thrown red smoke* 5 people got killed. The pilot laugh. 23 lives were lost to a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ mine field and 5 to a friendly CAS. The admins laugh their â¥â¥â¥ off and one of them said 'i am done, i am gonna play mahjong while crying instead of this' - actual quote and proceed to log off.  gg minefield simulator. most effective minefield in the history of arma. 11/10 would make a whole server laugh again.  Bohemia Interactive finally, FINALLY adds in support for 64 bit processing. AWW YISS
4053	1	a	Fell 50 meters out of a chopper in multiplayer, didn't open my chute and lived. 10/10
2063	1	a	Bought this game a week ago for $39.99 Now its on special for $19.99  10/10 would waste money again.
4011	1	a	Great game, but fps is â¥â¥â¥â¥ most of the time and the paywall stopping you from using dlc content is really annoying.
3806	1	a	Get this if you are looking for the biggest bang for your buck!
155	1	a	ARMA 3 is a great game if you don't like having fun, like me.  You're going to be fed bitter morsels of fun only after suffering like Sisyphus. But unlike Sisyphus, you will eventually succeed and the fleeting moment of victory will be much better as a result of your misery. It's even better when the suffering is compounded by playing with friends. After multiple restarts because a BDRM annihilated you with pinpoint accuracy from 3 miles away, you'll have a great time.  The main problem with this game is that it's set in 2035 and you're fighting Post-Human Space Iranians in a tank from the 70s. Thankfully, this game is supported by an excellent modding community and you can use mods to take the game back to the greatest era of human history; The Cold War. You might not get the chance to die on the atomic battlefields of the North German plains, but you can get pretty close to it thanks to this game and the dedication of the modding community.   Eventually, you will reach the mod singularity where you will simply have too many mods. You will spend hours in virtual arsenal making the perfect loadout. You will think 'Finally I create a decent depiction of an Iraqi republican guardsman circa 1991!' but you will feel nothing.  Thanks to this game I have had to confront the existential horror of consciousness, and I would recommend it to anyone.
3766	1	a	You like being a soldier?  You enjoy playing in a clan? You want almost full Realism?  50 - 200m are close quarters for you? Get this Masterpiece!  (Except if youre an Altis Life, Wasteland, Exile etc. â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, go suck a keyboard)
5126	0	a	Worst FPS ever if you have AMD. 15-22fps in most of the online modes. (AMD FX 6300, 8GB RAM, Radeon R9 270, etc.)
3684	1	a	I play this game a lot and after all this time I still do. I will also probably never stop
1837	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
431	1	a	Amazing Game Love playing it on Altis Life!! Wanna play on a good server? Altis Life of Steve is super good! 
4101	1	a	This game is awesome! I love &lt;3 Militarty games!
1270	1	a	Seems to be pretty good so far.
4697	1	a	This is one of my favorite games to play!
1430	1	a	Large scale multiplayer warfare. Best war simulation ever.
2355	1	a	i own my own prizza oven, you can add as many toppings as you want and it doesn't cost you extra
878	1	a	offline-60+ fps constant @ ultra settings online-25 fps @ lowest settings  apart from the terrible servers this game is amazing, in my opinion its the best military sim to date, at max settings the game pulls just over 2gb of gpu memory in a heavy area (i.e towns with heavy foliage and lots of buildings) it runs smoothly on a wide range of hardware ( as i'v tested) and is easy to achieve solid 60 fps on all hardware at good settings   
2043	1	a	I have to say everything you see in the trailer, will happen in your arma 3 experience becuz this is a great game for working in squads and teams to take down who ever ur fighting.  arma 3 rating mods 10/10 gameplay1000000000/14 having squekers yelling in the mic 0.1 % u will encounter them  combat10000000000000000000000/10 all in all this is the best realistic shooter i will ever play and i HIGHLY RECOMMEND U GET IT. IS IT WORTH 40$ YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS IT IS
1946	1	a	A really good game and defynetly the most realistic FPS out there. It requires strategy and teamplay. Its really hard and has a SUPER steep lerning couve (like 89Â°). The only issiue i have with it is that you have to buy all the DLCÂ´sto be able to play on multiplayer Servers. I personally really enjoyed Altis life. If you are planning to buy it, i definatly recommend it (with all DLC)!
1824	1	a	Great game fun to play I also really like the role playing servers on multiplayer
1328	1	a	This game is many different ways to play it. This game isnt like COD or Battlefield where the are only very few different ways to play it. COD or battlefield that it just eventually gets old. Arma 3 has a great campaign and it allows you to take matters into your own hands. Arma 3 also has a great multiplayer category to pick from. Arma 3 has a great survival gamemode thats just like DayZ but without zombies. Arma 3 also has gamemodes like capture the flag and deathmatch and a few others but one of the best multiplayer game modes is coop which is really good to play with friends. The greatest thing about arma 3 is that it really allows you to get the feel of what real combat is like and the realism of the game is unbelievably great. If your looking for a game that is really realistic then Arma 3 is probabaly the game you could be looking for.
192	1	a	This is a review and story about my time in Altas Life, one of the many gamemodes that Arma 3 has to offer. For anyone who doesn't know Altis Life is a real life simulation mode in Arma 3 with civilians, cops, rebels, gangs, and more. Now let's begin. &gt;Be me &gt;Playing Terraria because of the new update. &gt;Get skype called by my friends, asking me to help them join them in mining and selling uranium illegaly. &gt;Sounds fun as â¥â¥â¥â¥. &gt;Close Terraria and open Arma 3 &gt;Join the Altis Life server we usualy play on &gt;Spawn in Zaros &gt;I have full rebel gear from the last time that I was on &gt;Had to sneak around to avoid cops but it was night time so it was pretty easy &gt;Go to a car dealership and buy a offroad and speed off to the uranium mine  &gt;When I get there, my two friends are there storing uranium into what appears to be a semi and a van. &gt;The also loaded my truck up as well. &gt;We stock up on repair kits and drive off to the uranium refinery. &gt;Refine all the uranium and then head off to where we need to sell it. &gt;We finally get there &gt;My friend is in the building selling all the uranium. &gt;We ended up with a total of 1.5million dollars that we needed to take to an ATM asap. &gt;The at the topleft corner of my screen i see a message saying 'YOU ARE SURROUNDED, DROP YOUR WEAPONS AND GET DOWN ON THE GROUND OR WE WILL SHOOT' &gt;Battlemode engaged &gt;Look to see who we were dealing with &gt;It's the largest gang in the server with 11 players on with full military grade gear and two military helicopter &gt;All we have at the time was 3 people with bulletproof gear but â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ civilian weapons. &gt;A firefight ensues and we end up taken out four of their guys but we all end up dying. &gt;mfw that whole thing start from finish took about 2 hours of time &gt;mfw we lost a potential of 1.5 million dollars. &gt;mfw It was all worth it because Arma 3 is fun as â¥â¥â¥â¥. Seriously, if you want to have a great time with friends(Arma 3 is a game that I would recommend to have atleast 3 people with.) Buy Arma 3 when it goes on sale. But make sure to buy the DLC because most servers use it and you can't join unless you have it. 10/10 seriously one of the best games I have every played (if you're poor you can just get arma 2 and operation arrowhead and get a taste of the arma series before you spend $30 during a sale for a game you may not end up liking.)
1134	1	a	10/10
463	1	a	I own/DL&amp;crack/play tons of games. My rig = 2x GTX970s + i4970 + 16GB DDR3.  This is by far the best online shooter I've ever played. The emotional experience of playing online is on par with that of the HL2 single player campaign (although the games are nothing alike.) Everything in the game is rewarding if you stick around to figure it all out. Every day I play this game I love it a little more and I've had it for about a year. Hard to get bored in MP because there are so many different roles to perform (fighter pilot vs. tank crew vs. combat medic vs. sniper vs. drone operator..etc). I get bored of games easily and this one has managed to keep my interest.  The setting and gameplay is similar to the Battlefield games, HOWEVER--  The Battlefield games are arcades. This is a MILITARY SIMULATOR. You can simulate the tedious monotony of being a plane or heli pilot, ground-pounder, medic, tank crew, +others. I prefer the helis because they are very realistic in both physics and detail, including working gauges.  I recommend this game to anyone looking for an in-depth military simulator that is more rewarding the more you play.  I rate Arma 3 (MP) 89/100 For reference: I rate HL2 (SP) 91/100 I rate BF4 80/100 (on a good day.)
3612	1	a	Very nice game if u play coop
1140	1	a	I rate this game 2 raisons
1095	1	a	A mostly incomplete yet incredibly addictive and detailed sandbox that takes 'playing army' to an entirely new level.
1594	1	a	First thing Bohemia has done correctly. 10/10.
364	0	a	nah, I'm not buying the DLC to get in some vehicle when I paid full price for this game.
3446	1	a	This game is excellent!  If you are looking for a realistic military shooter, you got it. But becareful and check your specs, cause its hell on the machine.
308	1	a	I will destroy ISIS.
524	1	a	Robbed a guy for $1. 10/10
4025	1	a	Such a good game. Don't get it if you have a bad pc!
3498	1	a	This is one of the best games on pc for pvp a must need game if you need some
3527	1	a	it's realy a cool game while playing with friends
373	0	a	It's ARMA with a facelift. Honestly, I wish there was more to the game. I know it's alpha and more will be added -- but it's the stuff I've already seen which are bothersome. Physics engine still totally broken, still using that god-awful proprietary SQF scripting language which makes me want to kill myself (I know there's supposed to be some Java integration in the future, but that's not exactly a step up, and it most likely won't replace the SQF but will rather become an addition to it). There is some really cool stuff though. The helicopters are really fun to operate and you have a ton of (new) stances you can use to your advantage to find a sweet spot while taking fire. It's worth buying for the price for sure, but I'm a little sad they haven't improved the core more, nor does it look like they will in the beta or final release.
3474	1	a	Scares the crap out of me when im being shot at
3309	1	a	Good game, really funny if u can figure out how to play it. Worthwell to try it !
3140	1	a	If you are into millitary simulators, this is the game for you. I would pay 10x what this game cost just to play it!
1976	1	a	First you play this game and your like oh okay this is cool. Then you get mods and never leave your computer again.. 10/10 Would lose Social Life Again.
1278	1	a	If ARMA 4 does not come out, I will slit your mother.
915	1	a	This game is a a lot of fun for the right players. Looking for non-stop spawn and die? Then it's prolly not for you. Looking for some slower paced tactical action mixed with some intense battles? It's in there.
4292	1	a	Brilliant game 10/10
807	1	a	Excellent game, tactical gameplay. I have been playing ARMA since 2004, each version getting better and better
4186	1	a	War is hell.
3078	1	a	Awesome game here it has so much more potential than games such as cod or battlefield which are mainluy liniar games on arma theres no straight line thinking its like a giant sandbox with huge maps and vast mods and gamemodes to suit everyone. I would suggest this to anyone thats on the fence about the game or prefers a break away from Cod and battlefield a solid 10/10 from me
3902	1	a	THE BEST GAME EVER!
2990	1	a	This game looks pretty good. Played Arma 2, and was not disappointed. Looks like its time to check this game out
4074	1	a	I love this game have a lot of mods and roleplay servers is the best, singleplayer campaing is good but not perfect i give the game 9/10
1389	1	a	I absolutely love this game. And it just keeps getting better so I can only love it more. At first it may seem daunting to dive into and get familiar with. But after a while of playing, getting used to the controls and then learning some of the more advance controls, you can wage an entire war by yourself by commanding squads or with friends by playing cooperatively. With the Steam Workshop you can also find hundreds, if not, thousands of user created missions that are a lot of fun. I personally suggest Dynamic Universal War System for a fun but brutal gamemode that is really good for Co-Op or solo play.
2473	1	a	This is the best game I've every play for 20 years.  ARMA 3 10/10  ;)
1599	1	a	I do love Arma, but Arma 3 sets a different standard. The graphics are great! But you need a really nice pc to run it on high over 60 FPS. The gunfights are a bit iffy because of glitchy player modles and bullet penetration.
2421	1	a	It looks sweet, runs good but the controller layout is all over the place and you cant change it :/
3680	1	a	*Playing Zombie Mission with the squad*  Vito: 'Look guys a chopper! Cover me while I start the engine and fly us out of here!'  *Whole squad creates a perimeter around the chopper, shooting at hordes of undead while Vito frantically prepares the chopper for lift-off.*  Vito: 'We are ready to take off, everybody get in!'  *Everyone boards the chopper except one indivdual*  Alphamike: 'Drager get the â¥â¥â¥â¥ in the chopper!'  *Zombies begin circling around the chopper, closing in quickly.*  Vito: 'I will leave you behind I swear to god!'

4020	1	a	This game is the BEST army simulator anyone will ever play. I like how you can pick about anything for your character to use or wear. Every thing is realistic in this game and i highly recomend this game!
962	1	a	85/100
991	1	a	I like this game because it promotes same sex relationships.  In a firefight I was told to engage a man.
3417	1	a	Played altis life with my friends, we went for a cocaine run. We got big trucks and put offroad trucks in the back of our big trucks (yo dawg i heard you like trucks) We made it through the border to the cocaine field fine All of a sudden a another truck pulls up besides us, what must be a 10 year old child armed to the teeth jumps out, 'Bonjour!' &gt;Canada Not knowing a word of french my canadian friends exchange words as we gather raw cocaine for processing. We fill our trucks and the kid follows us in a 5 truck convoy We make it through the border fine, we stop because squeaky broke the wheels on his truck somehow. All of a sudden we hear a helicopter, its getting closer and closer, everyones looking. At this point hes right above us, hovering We all panic and take off flooring it at like 90km/h down the highway, Eventually we get pretty close to the cocaine lab, the helo broke away from us, we thought we were in the clear &gt;police APC joins the chase &gt;ITS NOT POLICE IN THE APC We all panic and split, my one friend is pursued by the APC, while the other two make it to the cocaine lab fine (for now) I am trying to break away from my friend because hes banking towards me in his truck with the rogue APC in pursuit I eventually make it far away, the helo returned and was chasing me now â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ getting heavy, im away from my friends all by myself getting chased by a helicopter, the guy is yelling at me in french and trying to stop me and steal my truck out of my big truck thats full of raw cocaine. I keep heading towards Altis capital Kavala, the chopper breaks away from me and goes towards it probably expecting me to sell my cocaine there. The pilots a dumbass and I manage to escape far away as my friends are shot dead at the lab. I make it to another city in 10 minutes, safe from the chase now. I was the only survivor of that chase.  Screenshot of the chase below  http://gyazo.com/b39c718d58262619a302babd0eba2071     (Eventually my friends got a moderator in the servers TS because we thought they freekilled us, but it turns out they could shoot us if there was an obvious pursuit and we werent stopping, and that they could take 50% of our inventory from our trucks, but they couldnt take our trucks and chop them, praise peaceful canadian servers. After a long discussion in french which i couldnt understand they said it was all RP and we all enjoyed it for the most part.)  10/10 best RP experience I have had in a video game.  The campaign to this game is really hard, but enjoyable.
4380	0	a	Don't buy this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥.   The campaign is still bugged, years after the game got out. Too many bugs and just annoying little things to be bothered playing it through. There is still a bug in place that prevents you from entering a boat and thus advancing with the campaign. The NPCs are often slow and hinder your progress. I found myself waiting for 15 minutes just for the idiots to catch up with me. I've restarted missions at least 5 times because some events just wouldn't trigger, making me stuck.  The optimization is a joke. It's laggy as â¥â¥â¥â¥. Especially in multiplayer, where changing your settings doesn't mean jack â¥â¥â¥â¥ because the server bottlenecks the fps (??!!).  You're basically forced to buy the DLCs. Most of the servers have DLC guns which you can't use unless you buy the said DLC, which makes the game kinda pay to win. Being forced to buy DLCs when you've already paid the full price is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing disgrace. â¥â¥â¥â¥ you Bohemia
3276	1	a	A virtual battlefield and simulation experience like no other since 2001 (Op. Flashpoint). And series, as Arma, continues to evolve with this great, yet not perfect, title. Enough said.
2786	1	a	its the perfect mil-sim game ever .... i just joined and i lost my mind .... really good game worth it ....
494	1	a	Picture yourself standing in the middle of â¥â¥â¥â¥ing nowhere then having to run 60 miles to get home, you picturing that? Well the game should really be called Arma 3 the real jogging simulator or dream smasher because let me tell ya you run for that long and get some cool gear, you're probably gonna get killed
3370	1	a	Skip to the bottom for a quick overview of this review.  Gameplay: When this game works it truly shines. Overall the game feels just a lot more tight than the previous ArmA games. The camera does not have that weird movement feeling anymore and is replaced by a normal first person camera. The gunplay feels pretty similar, though sometimes the hitboxes of enemies feels way off. It is a little more user friendly and less clunky than the other games. Scuba diving looks gorgeous and is a welcome addition. This is still a really complicated game and will take many hours to master. All the customization options are still here, and the raw number of weapons, vehicles, and attachments is stunning. The inventory is ever so slightly streamlined which makes it a lot easier to navigate it without losing any functionality. Beware though, the âGâ key is now grenade not gear! The modding community is very active and tons of content is being produced all the time. The base campaign is semi nonlinear and is so far tons of fun, and a hell of a lot less buggy than ArmA 2âs. This game as an absolutely mind boggling amount of content. 8/10  Sound: Much better than ArmA 2âs. The radio chatter almost sounds normal finally. The gunfire sounds pretty average, actually most of the sound effects are pretty average. However sound effects in the distance sound neat. Hearing the gunfire from a battle far away is always cool, as well as far away explosions. 6/10   Graphics: This is a beautiful game. As always the draw distances are jawdropping. The characters look a lot better, and most of the objects look equally good. Trees and other vegetation look freaking awesome. For me though, the lighting has been the biggest improvement. Seeing the sun poke through branches in trees has never looked so good. I wish this game ran just a little faster, and that it utilized a little more of my system resources. I am above the recommended specs for this game and still only get about 40 FPS with most settings turned to high. (Not ultra) 9/10  Story: For this kind of game a story is really not necessary, and yet we are treated to a halfway decent one! It is there and worth playing though, and is much improved over ArmA 2âs. The missions are a lot shorter, and thus generally have less scripting errors. 7/10  Editor: From what I can tell not a ton is improved over the previous editors. It is still super powerful and surprising not impossible to learn how to use. Lots of different kinds of missions could be made. Zeus, which is basically a 3D editor, is absolutely amazing except for one big drawback; it doesnât give you the option to save anything after you used it. I know it was intended for multiplayer but it would have been nice to finally have a 3D editor. 7/10  Multiplayer: I do not generally play the multiplayer aspects of games very much. However most of my experience with it was confusing and chaotic. To truly get the most out of it you would need to join a clan.   Summary: This is a very fun game with a ton of content that will only appeal to a small percentage of people. I personally loved it, and enjoyed the many tweaks it made to how ArmA 2 felt. Although not perfect, almost everything is improved and once again proved that ArmA is the leading military simulator. If you are interested in playing a game like that, this is the best the market has to offer.   Recommended to hardcore fans of FPSâs, people interested in military simulators, and to people who have played ArmA games in the past.  Recommended Purchase Price: 30 bucks if slightly interested  Full Price if you know you like this kind of game   Final Personal Score: 8.5/10
2310	1	a	Arma2 with some new weapon stances, granade shortcut keys and zeus live mission mode.  Definately worth getting with discount - would not recommend paying full price if u got Arma II already.
1170	1	a	Great game for anyone looking for a realistic war game. Probably the closest thing you'll actually get to shooting people. 10 potatoes/10 mushrooms.
12	1	a	-Play as Chinese. -Shaolin Master has a unique ability to convert enemy units defeated by him into disciples. -Hunt some treasures. -Treasure is guraded by an alligator. -Shaolin Master defeats the alligator with his bare fists. -Alligator instantly turns into a Disciple Monk.  10/10 Would convert alligators into disciples.

45	1	a	I highly recommend buying this game. The community for this game is great and has quite many players for a 9 year old game. I'm the leader of the clan TLDT and if you want to join just whisper me on eso. TLDT has over 100 members, a clan website and regular clan events.
2817	1	a	Amazing Game, honestly. Its a very fun game to play with friends or alone.   10/10
3669	1	a	Trust Bohemia they are engineer.
2196	1	a	Some kind of a middle-ground between Microsoft Flight Sim and Call of Duty, Arma 3 aims for realistic military strategy and deployment. Unlike a standard first-person shooter this doesn't manifest as a 'gritty' and 'hard boiled' experience, more rather it can bring to your attention just how hum-drum and by-the-numbers modern warfare can be waged.   Arma goes for such a hands-on touch that means in order to be effective in practically any deployment you must first familiarize yourself with the standards of calibrating your weapons for the specific range of the enemy you are engaging, and many encounters can be as simple as spotting an enemy combatant and relaying their bearing and distance from your position to an artilleryman.  To many this can be boring, but there is a rare value in such authenticity. That being said the scope of the base game is best left behind in favor of a modded gametype, and indeed the vast majority of working servers do require many mods to play. It can take a fair amount of time to properly set-up and play a modded game of Arma, but it should be known that Arma is workshop compatible and contains incredibly easy-to-use modding tools in it's own launcher.  Between finding players, setting up mods and generally familiarizing yourself with the game, it can take very long to get started, but thankfully the result is fantastic and completely unique, if a little buggy.
5253	0	a	A multiplayer game where the more established players bully and and abuse new players even if in the same team. Maps are epic as well as the hacking is epic. Game with great potential ruined by community.
1068	1	a	Arma 3 makes big steps forward with a huge world and more vehicles and weapons. This time around its trump card is Steam workshop integration though making downloading mods effortless. A smart move by Bohemia Interactive because it are those mods that will give Arma 3 its long lifespan. Unfortunately Arma 3 is quite inaccessible and doesn't seem to grow along with modern game design on certain fronts. Space time and perseverance are your best friends here, until Bohemia's support starts paying off.
1653	1	a	Want to get efficiently killed by a lot by AI ? Then this is YOUR GAME !
2930	1	a	THis is a rly good game, it has a lot of bugs but the overall game compensates for it! THe music is back chilling and insane :D really enjoy the mods!

4702	1	a	Amazing game. If you're a fan of the other Arma games, you need this.
4066	1	a	If you like military shooters and realism, this is your game.  Only complaint is the MP as its not overly optimized at the moment.
4885	0	a	this game needs work on some of its finer functions such as difficulty aiming and lag time as well as sensitivity.
3217	1	a	in 2 hours we bougth a car a boat managed to die 50 times drive my car into the sea then turn into a knagroo (somehow i managed to fly away with my char jumping like a kangoroo!   That's what my friend told me after we played this game (altis mode)
4724	1	a	Nice game !
3058	1	a	10/10 became is fish
3808	1	a	a huge game in itself with like 200 other games inside of it and the scariest and most realistic sounds / gameplay  
3881	1	a	Arma 3 is an amazing realistic military simulation game. The campaign/singleplayer itself is amazing, and the multiplayer just gets better. There are many servers and modifications you can make to the game to make it an even better experience.  I sold a knife in CS:GO for this game; It was worth it.
794	1	a	Arma 3  I would have to say after playing al least 70 hours, that this is an amazing game. If you see this on 30 dollars buy it now. Just be ready for the hard learning curve of gameplay and mods problems. 9/10
2370	1	a	Arma 3 is that type of game where its not just a Bloodshed battle but it has tactics and strategys that makes it realistic and fun
850	1	a	I don't play Arma 3 seriously enough to make a in depth review but most of the time when I get on with friends we have a blast
5325	0	a	If you wanna play life RPG's this is the game. There are rarely servers for TDM, LMS, CTF, or control. Its not even war. All of the servers are life RPG's. I was expecting way more out of this game. A WASTE OF $40..... Money back would be much appreciated... If this company has any heart..
3854	1	a	It was the only game i played till i had 140hrs on it. O.o
2813	1	a	+One of the best war simulator games ever! +Very easy to install mods +Nice world interactive (about 80% of the buildings can be destroyed) +Nice maps +Cool Graphics  -Some bugs -Hard to control by newbies  8/10
4615	1	a	This is war
3195	1	a	Well I purchased this game because of the exile mod thinking it would make a nice change of scenery, I was correct it is a very addicting game although the little bugs like driving a atv into a bush will kill you, dying in a house due to a millimeter gap between the wall and floor are annoying if you can look past it i'm sure you will very much enjoy it as a bonus there is a stupid amount of mods/maps/server to play, so you can always get something that you are looking for.
1227	1	a	I dont own this game but it says i do.  10/10 would play again. 
2051	1	a	This may be a long review, but I promise it's worth the read if you're thinking about buying Arma 3.  I play this game all the time. And honestly I can say that Arma 3 is probably the most flexible and least repetitive game out there. There are so many different game modes, modded game modes, mods and communities based around this game that you can never get bored of it. There are PvP game modes like King of the Hill, or Gun Game (if you can actually find a Gun Game server RIP). Survival game modes like Overpoch and Exile (Those 2 are mods). Roleplay game modes like Altis life (which is the main reason why most people buy Arma 3).  Installing Mods is easy and fun, if you have modding experience from other games it applies here. Get the files in your game folder and select them in the launcher. Or subscribe to them on the Workshop and they will automatically update. If you don't like that, there are Launchers that you can download to get specific mods, like A3Launcher or A3Sync. Modding opens up whole new ways to play, as there are so many mods that you can combine to create a really fun experience.  You can make your own missions, which is semi-easy with the new Editor. There is something called the 'Virtual Arsenal', where you get an arsenal (Basically where you can get anything in the game. Gun, Uniform, Launcher, Vehicle etc etc) and try out different things. Tutorials can also help you to learn the basics of movement, commanding, different caliber weaponry and flying. Flying is one of the more daunting things for new players, but you get the hang of it pretty early on.  Back to communities, Milsim is quite a big one on Arma 3, as well as Tactical realism groups too. I will try to explain the difference between the two to the best of my knowledge. Milsim is usually stricter, you will have to behave yourself a lot more and stick to specific equipment because you are probably simulating a Unit of any military from real life. Tactical realism however isn't the same as Milsim. In Tactical Realism, you could use any bit of kit you wanted, and different tactics, and it would still be realistic to some extent. So in all, Milsim is better if you want strict, military-like gameplay, and Tactical realism is better if you still want the tactical side, with more flexibility and at a more 'relaxed' pace.  You can play Arma 3 in many different ways depending on your playstyle too, if you like to get close with a full-auto weapon, you could do that. If you like to sit at a distance with a Marksman Rifle, you could do that. And this applies in any game mode, it's even better in a team because each person can have different roles that open up new ways to operate in different situations.  My review probably wasn't as good as some others, but there's too much to talk about. Buy this game, and have the dedication to push past the first few hours, and you won't regret it. I promise.
1019	1	a	Amazing Game, intense graphics and outstanding action packed stratigic gameplay
2330	1	a	Best FPS by a longshot. That simple.
3022	1	a	great game but needs more optimization and the modding community makes it better.
538	1	a	I never expected i would get into these kind of games, im really the last one who is playing millitary simulations but with some guys the kind of the hill mode is really fun. If you never tried the game you should try it BUT a big but  the game is horribly optimized, it crashes often, low fps, laggy.
972	1	a	People tend to play this for the military simulator, well I don't... There is this Arma 3 altis life mode. A mode made by community where I get all my hours and fun from where you can earn money with fishing drug smuggling, mining, selling stolen cars... Well now I am a little bit more experienced and joined the cops so fun to play on the Grandtheftarma server! Just check out a video on youtube Arma 3 altis life  10/10 game just like counter-strike
3171	1	a	Hard, challenging, frustrating, annoying, impossible, infuriating, still my favorite game
3533	1	a	After playing Altis life for the first time, I accomplished holding a guy up at a peach tree field outside Kola, or however it's spelled, I didn't know how to pick the peaches so i made the guy pick em for me at gunpoint, I then made him take off his cloths, why I did this? I don't know, but it was very amusing. He picked a couple hundred peaches, handed them to me, after doing so he booked it to my truck, which i stupidly left unlocked, he got in my truck, pulled a u-turn and hit me, I some how survived this, with very low health, like, very god damn low. He had to get rid of the evidence, including me. He pulled me off the road and behind one of the houses, he waited for me to bleed out. I told him he didn't have to do it, that he was a good person, he just sat there and waited. After a few moments, the light faded, It was game over, I goofed. Best first time playing Arma III ever. 10/10
4594	0	a	its gay you idiot why make a game which is gay 
660	1	a	Awesome war simulator, if You are tired of unrealistic FPS where You magically appear next to your squad. Arma 3 is for You. Patience is key in this game. The learning curve is somewhat steep. But once You get into a great team it's worth it. Solo content reminds of Operation Flashpoint and is allright. Multiplayer has a lot of MODs so the diversity of the game is pretty vast. Zeus is a gamemaster vs the players and great fun. Coop teamplay tactical is the most challenging to Your patience but also the biggest reward. AI in this game is getting better but not at its full potential, but definately better than many many other titles. The big sandbox is amazing but by default not 100% optimized, be prepared to read forums for tips and tweaks. The '-malloc=system' launch parameter should be default setting. I do recommend this game if You are into teamplay, solo not so much but then again I havn't tried survival servers. PvP has not been my thing in Arma 3 so can't tell if it is good or not.
3199	1	a	By far the best game I have ever played. Perfect for anyone who loves milsim and playing with serious people.
3930	1	a	play dis gam cause realistic  http://i.imgur.com/UJGbDoc.gifv    10/10
1886	1	a	This game is so amazing. You can do basically anything in this amazing game with all the community made maps, weapons, missions and so much more.WARNING I litterally spent $60 on this game then $1500 for a new pc and then $40 for a mic. Dammm.

4115	1	a	This game suck â¥â¥â¥â¥!!!!!! 0/10 IGN
2373	1	a	Amazing military sandbox game that lets you create anything you can imagine!
2692	1	a	This game makes me and my cpu feel useless.  11/10
376	0	a	Could be awesome, but the Devs lack the ability to polish the game to a enjoyable state.  We hosted some Coop Events but the AI even with Zeus support is too horrible. Buggy and after a while ingame they dont react to orders, even custom scripts cant fix it. They move like complete Morons, and once u figured out that they stop firing at a certain distance and just look at u, they become target pratice at best.  Wouldnt bother me if PvP works. Deathmatch modes without Mods do, the Rest starts lagging horribly after u go above 40 players(i5-4690k). Pepole warp around, cant enter vehicles unless they reconnect, random disconnects. Gunplay is awful, in cbq u both die due to the bad netcode.  Animations are from the 2000s, when u hit someone they start waving their weapon around , close to statics ur Soldier randomly goes from prone to standing up. Everything is clunky and unfinished, giving u an uneasy feel while playing.  The Scripting Wiki is outdated and some Commands dont work as described, or only sometimes, changing weather and stuff just stops working until u restart the server.  Waste of Money and Time.
4138	1	a	It's ok -IGN
2328	1	a	It's alright.
1967	1	a	Great game but needs better optimization. Even my Intel i5-4690 and a GTX 1070 cannot run this
693	1	a	So me and my friend were in a server messing about with heli's and my friend landed next to an enemy squeaker, i snioped the little sh*t and then we healed him and made him drop everything.... as soon as we had all his stuff we took him to a field and made him lay down until we had taken off in the heli, so we went into the heli and was going to fly past telling him he can go now thats when i decided to blow him up with the heli guns. we got half way across the map and felt bad so we said we will meet him back at the airport and pick him up... he was waiting there in a tank and blew us out of the sky.  10/10 would be an â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ to a sqeuaker again
436	1	a	i love the game, awsome map, great textures the hard thing is get used to the control
1128	1	a	I Â´m going to be honest, It isnÂ´t such good as arma 2. Despite better optimization,graphic and Zeus ( zeus is really good but its hard to use unofficial addons to run zeus correctly) is more drawbacks what i have to say. It wasn't fell like arma anymore, but like CoD or BF, unreal weapons(ammo, units, vehicles), body armor system ( the biggest problem at all in my opinion , it was probably mented like good think, but if you shoot soldier twice in chest, he cannot be able to return fire, ok, he MAY survive but that should be all). Positive think is FREE bootcamp ( but it doesn't fully support addons) what is sad... virtual arsenal loadouts re not able ti share in zeus. (when I said is positive, it was because its free, what is not common in nowadays). But you can as normal add addons and mods in arma, what makes it playable again. In result : Arma 3 is worth to buy for common player only because Zeus, nothing more have any value. If you re arma enthusiast (like me) and you are going to play arma 3 with mods and addons its good improvement after arma 2 (more support, more mod and addon makers, bigger maps). 
597	0	a	Amazing game but terrible at the same time i played a good 210hrs of the game just to get on the next day and see i was banned i tried contacting them and they did nothing but i researched it and i dont have it the worst people have played for 5hrs and been banned for nothing dont recommend this game at all.
433	1	a	I go to sleep comfortably every night, because I know my tovarisch loves me  10/10
1197	1	a	ArmA 3 will consume you and your Social life!  Thought I would play Exile DayZ with a few friends, we spawned sky diving over Altis, we try and find each other whilst looting houses and fighting the undead, moments later we are all together at last.  As we walked for ages we thought that we should rest up so I find out we have xm8 Mobile tablets, I use it and spawn a push bike, the other's do the same.  As we was all riding into the town, one of us could not stop in time and crashes into a wall, he died on impact, so I park up and get off to say my goodbye's, another friend runs me over with my bike whilst I said good bye, he stands there next to our body's to protect our loot, we both return to our bodies. Collected all our gear and realised our friend had taken ammo from each of us. We confront him in a building. He says he never took it, he gets shot in head.  As we loot his corpse he had taken our ammo. So the simple conclusion behind this story is..... You cant trust anyone, Not even friends!
4305	1	a	One of the best games in my library, do I have to explain myself, it's Arma!
3598	1	a	Very nice game if u play coop
2768	1	a	If you have a good enough computer to run it then its definitley worth it.
4024	1	a	Well i had it then Steam took it away from me. :(
3679	1	a	How to play ARMA:  .Skip Tutorial .Go Multiplayer .Dies alot .Go Campaign  .Die .Go scenario .Die .Go tutorial  .Go multiplayer .Repeat 
4644	1	a	Hands down the best military type game there is. Cod and battlefield can't hold a candle to Arma.
2390	1	a	Fantastic game, As an Arma II player, seeing the new advances in ArmaIII is quite outstanding and provies for a more enjoyable expierence.
1357	1	a	Good game for the $$.
298	1	a	Its like skyrim with cops 10/ign
79	1	a	A brilliant simulator beyond words.  Drop your CoD console controllers and get in here.   Nobody will call you a 'â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥' or a 'â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥' or threaten to â¥â¥â¥â¥ your mother.  In here - we are all in it together, equally worthless and equally ambitious ;)  \m/
3841	1	a	great game but not as good as arma 2
383	0	a	To be on point: Before purchasing Arma 3 I read about it on forums and on Steam reviews. Indeed, many said that at the moment Arma 3 is just not finished and it is not worth buying and playing as it is. I really liked the game idea and thought that it can't be that bad, so I purchased it. Boy I was in for a big surprise. And I am not talking only about the poor optimization of the game. The whole game feels weird, laggy and just plain wrong. The controls are a mess. For example, to fly with a joystick you have to set all the actions manually. At least in my case. Graphics wise, I might get older but the whole image seems to be blurry and out of sync. Maybe the biggest grief is with super human AI enemies. Somehow they can see you even in the darkest and deepest forest, while there is NO way you can see them, yet alone shoot them. I am sory to say, I regret the purchase and would not advise anyone to try the game in the current state. I would say in a year or so maybe, but not now. In case you want to help out the developer and support the game, by all means, purchase the game now. Play it later :) Do not get me wrong, the idea is super, the complexity is there, visual apeal is there, but it needs a lot of polish to be playable. I would like to state, for the record, that I couldn't get myself to play it for more than one hour. Maybe if I would have spent more time (I guess a lot more) in the game, I would have liked it more.  Just for reference: I7 2600k @ 4.4 ghz nVidia GTX 580 1.5 GB RAM 16 GB RAM @ 1600 Mhz CAS 8 Samsung Evo SSD = 40-50 FPS in SP  This is just my personal opinion and experience of the game. Take it with a grain of salt.  Over and out.
1301	1	a	One of the Best games this year!!
4717	0	a	Not worth $60, constantly bombarded me with DLC notifications, modifying is extremely unorganized. A super fun and well made game besides my complaints. I recommend only buying if you like multiplayer, and if it was cheaper than $60.
2004	1	a	This is my absolute most favorite game that I have ever played. I don't say that often. When I first started to play Arma back in Arma 2, I had the hardest time learning the controls. But it didn't take long to learn the controls and get the character movement down, even though this is the one game that was the most difficult for me to learn all the controls with. Now that I have played it and tried all the game modes played on many different servers, I am now having the most fun playing a video game than ever before. Also, I LOVE flying helicopters. I can now pull off some crazy stunts that most pilots don't even want to try. My favorite 'mode' or 'mod' to play now is Arma 3 Overpoch. Brings together all the old guns and vehicles that I used back in Arma 2, and the new weapons and vehicles that Arma 3 has to offer. Hands down best game I have ever had the pleasure of having in my steam library. I give this game a solid 10/10.
1909	1	a	blew up a town full of hobos 10/10
4449	1	a	Call of Duty's more educated and respectable older cousin. An FPS for the thinking man who appreciates the real life brutal realities of combat. This game doesn't grab your hand and guide you to its breast, this game makes you work for your entertainment. Treat this game right, take the time to understand its nuances, and never underestimate it's bite, and you'll have a much more rewarding experience than you can achieve with most FPS games. When a mission is carried out via your own strategic wit and whim, and hours are spent infiltrating and avoiding enemy patrols so that you can make it to that perfect firing position for your sniper, it really makes that one shot a lot more heart pounding than any round fired in any other military shooter. If you have ADHD, watch wrestling, appeared on Jerry Springer, think Call of Duty is a good game, and/or are the offspring of two genetically similar parents, you will NOT enjoy this game.
2969	1	a	Walking Simulator! and a god damn good one! alot to do. go on and explore the amazing world of Arma3
2793	1	a	It is was a really nice game and all the stuff you could do. man i cant put it in words just buy it.

I would have no bugs they said... I would not get pushed off the road by some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ in a gokart they said...  They lied...  11/10  Would get run over by russian guy again.
212	1	a	One of the few pc games that isnt a port, but still feels like one. 10/10
4367	1	a	By far one of the best games i think i have played :D would recommend!
1049	1	a	This game will test your computer's CPU. But feels like a good game, until I get off it, then I notice...I haven't done anything in the game. lol
1172	1	a	This a great game if you liked Arma 2 you will. Love this game
4566	1	a	This game is fricking amazing its got HD textures and the driving and shooting is well thought out and that just makes this a whole lot better. There is nothing I dislike in the game
1379	1	a	My favorite game of all time its amazing and i certainly recomend everyone to play it. Tell your friends! The only downside about this game is that you need quite a good internet connection for the online multiplayer servers but my connection is great!
8	1	a	Age of Empires III. How can one possibly begin to review a game of such magnitude and prevalence that this game holds on the gaming world? A game that, even though it has been out for over 10 years, has a large active online community? It isnât possible, but I shall nevertheless try.  This game has a rich story, which is full of interesting historical points. Even though it is fictional, it pleasantly covers the conquests of the new world. In the vanilla version and âThe War Chiefsâ expansion, the player can endeavour to fight against various European civilisations in order to achieve glory and fame throughout the Americas. In âThe Asian Dynastiesâ expansion, it spans centuries of Asian colonialization by the British as well as the Japanese and the Chinese Dynasties.   The gameplay is a perfect reflection of the RTS genre. You slowly build your settlement to include markets, barracks and a host of other buildings, increasing your population and army before getting ready to attack your enemy or defend your settlement. Getting the fine balance between your food, wood and coin collection can be challenging but rewarding when you get it right. Will you build a good army to begin with, or a good economy, praying that your enemy wonât attack before youâve had chance to convert your good economy into a powerful army? Each of the units has a strength and a weakness. For example, skirmishers counter musketeers, cavalry counters skirmishers, and musketeers counter cavalry. So itâs important to get the balance right when creating your army. The new eso-community patch has nicely levelled out the civilisations, making the OP civilisations slightly less powerful and the UP civilisations slightly more powerful.  Graphically, the game is simply gorgeous. Even though itâs definitely not a new game, it doesnât feel outdated in this respect and looks magnificent from a distance (youâll want to play fully zoomed out to maximise what you can see on the screen at all times). From buildings setting on fire and slowly crumbling as they take damage, to the glorious water reflections, to the breathtaking bloom effects, youâll be wondering whether it was actually made in 2005, or 2015.  The music is purely divine. Iâm listening to it as I type this as itâs one of my favourite game original soundtracks of all time. As your colony grows into a mighty empire the soundtrack seamlessly transitions from slow, peaceful renaissance/discovery era, to the powerful and more rhythmic late game, mimicking the chugging of steam engines and factories as you journey into the industrial age.  Overall, a stunning game. If you havenât ever played it, buy it and experience it for yourself. You will not be disappointed.
1233	1	a	Must buy if you like military tactical shooters
1500	1	a	It's pretty neat stuff. I find it to be a pretty big improvement from Arma 2
3073	1	a	Great game, if your a fan of Bohemia it's a must have!
4479	1	a	This game is too hard for me.
1468	1	a	I met my first boyfriend through a match. We met after and had hot, tasteful anal. My â¥â¥â¥â¥ creamed with the force of a thousand Ron Pauls as he pulled his thick, greasy â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of my â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Oh, the game is fun also.
583	1	a	I have this game for so long and I really discovered it in these recent weeks .... The mods are so amazing. Especially zombies mods, my favorite. I have a lot of funny moments with my mate. Super game, infinite pleasure! I definitely recommend this game!
3829	1	a	Graphically stunning  Community content either PVE or PVP extremely diverse and many mods offer extremely rewarding experiences.  90% of any good multiplayer experience in ARMA is found through good communication either relaying enemy positions or chatting and making friends with other players.   Have a Mic and know how to use it responsibly. Be mature in the way you communicate and you will make friends and have a good time.  game is regulalry on sale for 50% however is worth every $ of its regular price.
2766	1	a	i absolutely love this game, its got a great campaign and also you can have open world to look around for resources to help you on your next mission. i really love this game and recomend it to anyone who is a military fan-boy
1851	1	a	So much fun, so many scenarios endless possibilities, lots of mods, lots of gamemodes and lots of hours well spent that ill never regret. rating out of 10? 100% a 10. i love the game, i dont know what i would do without it xD
4606	1	a	Just purchased Arma3 on the 50% of sale. I have to say I am a huge Arma2 fan, but I was blown sky high when I started playing Arma3. The reviews somehow just did not do it justice for a big Arma2 fan. I actually did not know if it was that much different form Arma2. I was so wrong. Arma3 is better in every way so far. Weapons, graphics, sound, player interaction, UI menus, etc. etc. I have only had it for one day now, and it is by far my best PC purchase in a long time. Also, I have bought into all of the survival games on EA to which even though I am happy to support the games i chose to support, none of them have become fun to play for me. I like DayZ Mod and let me tell you Breaking Point for Arma3 is the answer! You get a zombie game plus all those vehicles and weapons! The Epoch servers are also so much fun in Arma3, vehicles everywhere on some of them, planes, helis, tanks...etc. So much fun. Good Job Bohemia Interactive and Good Job to all the modders out there!
4762	1	a	Got the game Played for 2 months Have â¥â¥â¥â¥ tons of fun Played Altis Life Found a man with no pants running around Ask the man for drugs Smoked crack   10/10 Would ask the man for drugs again.
2048	1	a	Awesome game love it
1501	1	a	Battle simulator like no other. It is as realistic as possible. Massive modding options, which gives many different game options. Want real warfare simulation? You have it. Want faster more like BF gaming style? Go with King of the hill game mode. Want to fly, shot people with tanks, coordinate strategy? You can choose all that and more.
4608	1	a	If you like open word shooters this game is EPIC! best to get with friends
4618	1	a	Phenomenal military simulation
4217	0	a	Are you kidding me? I spend so much time trying to keep up with the AI's that I'm always so fatigued when we come into contact that I cant shoot? Half the time I cant even see them. Its either that or never get into a fire fight and spend the whole time running around a forest listening to panting sounds! Its utterly ridiculous. There's some great features and I would really like to play the game but at this point I'm so frustrated that I'm over it.
3138	1	a	i've pondered purchasing this game many times over the last year. i've never played an arma title. i REGRET not purchasing it the first time it crossed my mind.
1527	1	a	10/10
2662	1	a	Do drugs, not Arma. You can thank me later.
3605	1	a	Pass the  weed  PTSD
602	1	a	this game is fun i have had loads of fun theres plenty of game modes and mods so engoy your self 10/10 would play it again
3617	1	a	this my first game in steam
3495	1	a	one of my fav games
5021	1	a	just a sphere moving around the screen.  More entertainment playing Pong.   10/10 spicy memes again
1458	1	a	i love arma 3 its the best game ever
3689	1	a	A great open world, military simulator that allows players to go and create their own content, game modes, and missions. It is good, possibly even better that is has been the day it came out. With the APEX DLC released, it was made Arma 3 almost a whole new game, with a new map, vehicles, weapons, and characters.
5196	1	a	top game
1022	1	a	Arma 3 has come on leaps and bounds since i bought my copy 2 years ago, it just gets better especially with the new apex edition dlc as you get to go to Tanoa and also get to use more vehicles including vtol aircraft. I have 1800 hrs approx in game and 1650 of those hours have been since last july time when i discovered the Exile mod. 10/10 bohemia interactive and keep up the good work
2701	1	a	Best military sim on the market, and it's not even close.
4129	1	a	My squad went into battle without pants but in full combat gear.
170	1	a	My honest to Gaben review. Base Game: -Open Arma 3. -Find highly populated server. -Spawn. -Realize everyone is chillin' in the military base talking about things completely irrelevent to the game. -Select weapon. -Walk 3km to enemy outpost. -Realize you could have taken a vehicle. -Try to take on over 10 AI. -Get 360 noscope-one-tapped by an AI. -Stare at computer and take a moment to realize what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ had just happened. -Close Arma 3.  Epoch: -Find high pop. server. -Find a gun. -Freak out and think gun is rare. -Find 6 more guns. -Go to trader. -Sell guns. -Buy car. -Lost car to bandits &lt;10m away from safezone. -Complain to admins. -Attempt to steal car back. -Get banned for stealing car. -Shake head. -Close Arma 3.  Exile: -Spawn. -Run 10km and find a 5.56 magazine with 1 round. -Throw your hands into the air in disgust. -Close Arma 3.  Altis Life: -Spawn. -Run to drug farm. -Crash ATV into a rock. -Call taxi. -Taxi repairs ATV. -Collect drugs. -Drive ATV back to main city. -Killed by 'Freedom fighters'. -Respawn. -Xxx_ThugL1feM4ster_xxX approaches you. -Xxx_ThugL1feM4ster_xxX roasts you. -Fellow civilian gets in man's face, 'What u talkin bout boi. Wut u doin to tis guy her.' -Man freaks out and sings Drake. -Civilian: 'Shoot me ri-now. Do it. I dare you. You ain't go the b-' -Civilian dies to gangster. -Run. -Get mowed down by the random civilians with military-grade weapons. -Respawn. -Go to ATM. -ATM glitches and resets money. -Bash keyboard. -Close Arma 3.  10/10 would stick â¥â¥â¥â¥ in blender again.
1978	1	a	Very challenging and very fun. A experience unlike any other.
4947	1	a	Excellant game, great graphics and physics
4331	1	a	10/10 would 9/11 again!
2192	1	a	Arma 3 is The perfect game if you're looking for a military simulation.  -Good Points: There is a lot of multiplayer server. Some server can host until 200 people. The Eden Editor allows you to create your own misssion and to publish it in the Steam Workshop. You have a lot of military and civilian vehicle/weapon/stuff. The graphics are pretty good. There is tons of mods and content.  -Bad Points: Not very optimised. The AI could be better. Sadly you can find bug/glitches.
988	1	a	Amazing game. All i can say. Arma 3 or any Arma game isnt like cod. This is a strategy game. Not a game where you can camp in a corner with an Lmg. I highly recommend this game for everyone. accept squekers. 
5250	0	a	I have a great computer, the FPS is a huge problem for this game. Your lucky to get it around 30-40. This game is a game you play with friends or not at all. This is just not for me.
4197	1	a	It's Alright
142	1	a	If you want to play the best military simulator experience, Arma 3 is your best bet. It has the combat, vehicles, weapons, it has it all. I have played Arma 3 for around 300 hours and it is still fun. There are a variety of different game modes that you can play: such as Wasteland, which is less serious than others; Life servers are for the ones who probably played a lot of DarkRP in Garry's Mod; Insurgency and Domination, they are also good tactically played gamemodes which are sometimes taken a lot seriously.  Lovely game, 10/10.
4362	1	a	If like simulation military ganes this one is for you you can fly a jet thru a wall and not die you can also get shot by a rocket dierectly in the chest and not die BEST SIM GAME EVER 
427	1	a	This game is so realistic, I love it. This is the game you're looking for if you search for mature players
4232	1	a	A fantastic game which hold countless hours of gameplay and stories and funtimes :DDDD
1826	1	a	Super steep learning curve, just learning the basic controls is difficult, and it's probably one of the only games where something simple can get you killed by the enemy. Because of this it's incredibly realistic, the online community is very helpful, and there's no twelve year olds telling you they banged your mom on this game. It's also a great game if you enjoy sandbox games, the editor is great and has it's own sort of learning curve if you want to make anything complex. Zeus is probably my favorite game mode from any video game, since you're either controlling everything on the spot or you're playing a mission that's being made for you on the spot. Despite all this the RV engine sucks â¥â¥â¥ so 8/10
2369	1	a	My one word reveiw 'Amazing'
4574	1	a	Arma 3 is a semi-new game that was released in 2013, and it is thriving with players! From game modes of Team Death Match, King of the Hill, Zombies, and Roleplay, Arma 3 has tons of game modes for you to play! My absolute favorite game mode is King of the Hill, where three teams pit themselves off against capturing and holding a point, there are vehicles, a leveling system, and different weaponry and perks all included with a cash system.   Arma 3 is open for modders in the Steam Workshop, and this increases great chances for the game to survive upon the universe of gaming in general. Modding is perfect for games, because players can do the work, they can create what they feel is needed, what they want to see in a server, and what they know is perfect for the community.   Good things:   -Great combat  -Tactical combat, and meant for strategy, not run &amp; gun  -Has Steam Workshop support and availability, great for modders who want to help the Arma 3 community out!  -Plenty of gamemodes, ensuring to keep you endlessly drooling for what may happen next  -Plenty of vehicles   -Large, full scale maps with the ability to go inside almost every building  -Destructible enviroments (limited to some different entities)  -Amazing campaign, and tutorial (the tutorial kept me entertained for a good while)   Bad things:   -The game has a semi-steep learning curve to it  -Some minor bugs like playermodel glitching, etc  -Things arn't fully destructable like in the Battlefield 4 engine (but good enough)  -Graphics may seem outdated on some models  -It's abit hard to get into the game as a new player, but you'll grind into the game eventually   Neutralities:   -The game requires teamwork, and a mic if you want to be involved in so, although there are many lonewolfs out there  -Your average PC might be able to handle it, it all depends  -Cats enjoy watching you play it (atleast mine does)  -You may have tons of fun in this game if you know how to play it in your own special ways, wether it is transporting toops via aircraft, or by infantry squads/ground missions, to full-fledged combat in the many suburban towns of the maps in Arma 3  Overall, I  do  recommend this game to anyone and everyone that is around 14+ of age, whom can understand how to work things, and avoid the sharp learning curve, along with that I really do hope that for any of you that have quit the game because of the learning curve, to give the game a few more tries, as I did this before, and I came back loving the game.  If you'd like, you can add me and play with me on Arma 3, Garry's Mod, TF2, CS:GO, Battlefield 4, and many other games that all of you should commonly know if you're an average gamer, anyways, take care.  
4404	1	a	Best game ever!!! Cannot wait for Arma 4.
4923	1	a	best milsim of all times. period
614	1	a	Get it noobs! Also - SuMatra Wastelands - US # 2 . Come get owned.
1970	1	a	Man my dreams came true of becoming a soldier thanks arma 3 ð
4604	1	a	TactiCOOL
5160	0	a	do u want to get blown up by screaming arabics? no? DONT DOWNLOAD. do u want to get run over by some â¥â¥â¥ wipe? no DONT DOWNLOAD. ARMA 3 is not a fun game. DONT DOWNLOAD
1817	1	a	Bought it for breaking point, didnt disappoint me. The mod is better than Dayz Standalone itself    there is no dsync, no fps drops,   and you can bury people    yes, you can bury people  
834	1	a	I havent really played Arma 2 much but i have to dare say that i think Arma 3 is one of the BEST games i have ever played!!! Zeus mode alone is worth it when you have friends to play with. Foget Call of Duty and yes even forget Battlefield, this is the ultimate FPS shooter on pc available.  Although Arma 3 might be a little taxing on lower end machines its worth the buy if you want a solid campaign, insane multiplayer and all round good laughs with your friends!  
4097	1	a	this is the best game for PC there is no need to do a review,.......I'd like to have one of these vehicles when I'm on the street, because in Italy the people drive like dogs.
618	1	a	Just... Amazing. I see a lot of fun ahead. Still a noob and it is just great. AMAZING community. Found a great guy on a server and he spent over an hour just showing me how to play.   Why are you even reading this, just buy it.
4456	1	a	If you are into Stat Padding then this is not for you. Yes the Arma range has been problematic but Arma 3 has solved most of that. This is a game of patience, team work and skill. If you are a 1 man platoon then yes you can play but you wont get the full experience this game offers. This game has so much to offer and such a large community adding content that you should give it a tryâ¦.
3224	1	a	Possibly best game ever played, very immersive. 11/10 'it was okay' -IGN
761	1	a	This game has to be the best immersive game you can ever get makes you feel like its real life.
4603	1	a	not bad needs a few improvements
1762	1	a	Amazing overall its great for really imersing yourself in the experience of a real life army sim.
2061	1	a	  this is what i need.............. &lt;3 10/10
2534	1	a	It's OK I guess......
3775	1	a	it crashes more often than Paul Walker but except from that its okay  see you again/10
258	0	a	Gonna start off by saying the game itself is great. The series is moving in the right direction. Or so i thought.  Developers, not just BIS, are only out for money these days. I started to love ARMA 3 then i see the ridiculous dlc attached to this game. Who in the â¥â¥â¥â¥ thought it would be a good idea to create a couple of helicopters and some sniper rifles and â¥â¥â¥â¥ing pawn them off to the community.   Are we gonna get to a point where games companies create a shell of a game and â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sell the sky as dlc? or each individual vehicle THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE GAME FROM THE START!!!  Are we already there?
1697	1	a	Best shooter on the market
4454	1	a	Game has amazing graphics. That is all I need to say.
2799	1	a	Great game, love it!
3326	1	a	Wow... So much fun. So tacky So buggy, So laggy :3
281	1	a	Such an amazing game. Definitely without a doubt the premier modern era FPS. Some amazing clans/communities as well.
2646	1	a	Damn is this a fun game. I love ARMA 3. While it still has a few iffy features from ARMA 2 like the all terrible context menu, this game is a gift that keeps on giving. If you like mission making, this game has one of the best mission makers I have ever seen. If you like tactical shooters, this is one of the best. Get together with some friends or randoms and do military like operations. Or maybe you like a more casual shooter, this has that too. With modes like King of the Hill or just plain deathmatch, you can play it just like a shooter, albeit way more fun. With modes like Zeus you can make missions easily on the fly with friends and have great fun. I really recommend this game as it has given me many hours of entertainment.
523	1	a	really awesome game 10/10 way better than arma 2
2869	1	a	This game is absolutley amazing in just about every way. The game itself is pretty good and has a brutal campaign that will last you a long time. But the true ARMA experience is the multiplayer which delivers time and time again with players even making their own regiments,companies, and divisions. And if the game gets boring like it did for me there is always the steam workshop with a never ending amount of mods to keep you interested like new nations, weapons, vehicles, maps, functions, characters, scenarios, re skins, and much more.
3128	1	a	Pretty damn good, make for sure you have a good gaming PC before buying.
5056	0	a	Game is still broken after all these years... The guys are Bohemia Interactive are bunchve â¥â¥â¥â¥ing cokeheads selling a few helo dlc's to get more coke.
2204	1	a	I love this game. I have spent more time playing this game than I can imagine and I think it will be the reason I upgrade my PC - to make use of the great graphics available.  The ability to mod the game is awesome and I've enjoyed using the editor as much as the game itself. Great stuff.  The aApex DLC appears good, but i am not overwhelmed by it.
1947	1	a	This game isn't battlefield bad game nor does it have a big map like planetside. This game isn't the best game ever. It's just better than most and IT'S it's own game.
1289	0	a	this glitchy game can suck it! pay to win, and terrible online and every time they have a patch it screws something else up and its been like this for like 3 years! wtf! I have been trying to play this online for an hour now and no luck. not worth it.  120$ for an unfinished game with DLC that favors money spenders. By all means teach them a lesson and do not give them your business until they shape up, we dont need another call of duty clone   almost 600hrs wasted thanks bohemian.
1801	1	a	Although this is a supremely hard game to run, although this game is sometimes supremely boring, although this game can sometimes give you intermittent explosive disorder, it is still one of my absolute favourite games because of the intensive situations, range of excellent weapons, and intresting gameplay. The great range of vehicles and weapons gives the game a immersive feeling. The visually stunning graphics made my eyes bleed for everytime i played it. The social and friendly (ish) community is great. I without hesitation definatly recommend this game to you. I guarantee this will be great - just make sure you play it for a bit as it may seem to be boring at first.
4593	1	a	  If you like to use a compass, cordinates, and other things to calculate range, and place of the enemy, and don't understand like every person who plays the game, this game is for you         +The Realistic graphics Mil. Simulator. KoTh, Altis Life, Battle royal, And zombie MODES, wasteland and many other modes. and LOTS of running, if u don't have a car, like in wasteland.....Or exile/Epoch..........Or Altis Life................OR KoTH............OR almost every mode. 
1526	1	a	ArmA III is an amazing game by itself, but when you start trying out some of the community mods that is when you really see it's potential. Mods like Altis Life, King of the Hill, Epoch, Overpoch and so many more turn this one game into an entire game bundle w/ plenty of different game styles. I have been in the ArmA community for years and have contributed whenever I can. I love the game, love the community &amp; love the new CQ Mod for Arma 3 set to release very soon! My opinion on the CQ Mod may be a bit biast considering i'm on the dev team, but i still know a good mod when i see one. Check it out for yourself; CQ Mod Gameplay video  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wEUajuUqDY   CQ Mod Armory Selection System  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mU1KSAjHaIM  
2348	1	a	got shot in the head and died instantly, 10/10
2080	1	a	Kids play Cod Teens play BF Russians play CSGO Everyone play Arma 3(except normal people)
2314	1	a	Amazing game! Alot of different community made gamemodes available.
3843	1	a	Arma 3 is a fun and complex military simulator that is not only as an awesome game on it's own, but serves as a platform for many awesome game modifications - my favorite being Exhile mod. While it has a strange and less-than-functional physics and animations systems, a moderate range of bugs (in multiplayer); and performance issues on AMD processors... - it still is great game well worth the price of entry.  Also, 64-bit executable coming soon!
4253	1	a	I have been looking for a game like ArmA 3 since I started with shooters. I always thought Call Of Duty, or Battlefield 3/4 was the most simulated you could get without really going to war. This game is war. This simulator requires players to really try, it is not a run and gun game, you do that, you die. You need to be tactical, aware of your surrondings, and be prepared for anything, from a fireteam of men, to a sniper team, to tanks sitting on the hilll line. Everything about this game is amazing. Grapihc are awesome, if you can run them on normal or higher, the AI, and ragdolling could use some work. One con of this game is the AI, sometimes there smart, sometimes there dumb. They can get hit with a grenade at point blank range, break there legs, lay down and bandage, then get up and run away.    Over all, 20/10, would recommend to anyone who wants a good shooting simulator.
1204	1	a	Shooting dudes is all that keeps me sane.
2083	1	a	I throughly enjoy this game. I use all the DLC except APEX. In my opinon, this is a fantastic game to play with your 'hardcore' rpg game friends. You can be as tactical as you wish, or be careless and fool around in heli's all day. The controls take a bit to get the hand of (because there is so many) but once you do, you feel as if you are not limited at all as to what your player can do in-game. Most of the time the physics are pretty good, but somtimes they are just hilarious. I would give this game a 8/10 rating, and highly recomend it to any adventureous and thrill seeking gamers.
1748	1	a	EA and DICE, you should be ashamed of yourselves, letting another game take Battlefields spot. This is the next big thing in FPS teamwork and sandbox gaming.   Too bad guys, you spent too much time pandering to hardware that is more concerned with TV and BlueRay than games, making your games smaller so they run on outdated hardware with poor control systems and pooping on the people who bought you your Ferraris. Bohemia Interactive has taken the reins and taken the lead. You should have seen this coming with Arma2, especialy after DayZ. Bohemia Interactive already has my money and where is BF4... Not in my games library.   Arma3 is the AAA title you should buy. Don't waste your money on Battlefield X or Call of Duty X, this is what you want right here. Once you buy this you will dig in and not look up at all the crap that is being pooped out, packaged and sold at a premium price. Arma3 is priced at $59.99 or $64.99 for the Digital Deluxe Edition (or if you want my recomendation, go straight to the Bohemia Interactive website and support them directly by buying the Supporter Edition) you can't go wrong. Drop some cash on this and you wont need or want to spend your money on anything FPS until the next Arma3 content release.   See you on the islands.   Edited for price changes as it was written during Beta.
2411	1	a	A very underated game definitely deserves 85+/100 just take some getting use to and adjustments!
4352	1	a	Got kidnapped he told me to lick his balls i did he gabe me a gun out of trust he killed me in a gun fight 10/10
2321	1	a	i endorse this product and/or service

1662	1	a	Welp, I've clocked over 1k hours on this game, lots to do.
2873	1	a	Well since Ive logged over 1500 hours in this game, I figured I cook up a review and maybe these types of reviews with people who have more than 500+ hours can be trsuted more than the common, 2hr junky and already talking â¥â¥â¥â¥ about the game.  Anyway, as a military veteran, this game has never fell short to living up to the expectations that I had been hyped for when I first purchased it. Mods, mods and many more mods, that can sum up what I do mostly on this game and if you have the pastience for mods and and server hopping every now and then, then this game will suit you well. I have no complaints for this game because it is always being updated almost 1 a month and mods just keep rolling in all the time. Community is as cancer as any game community, half of them are trying to be trols and the others just dream to big to be like the big youtubers.   
4826	1	a	Awesome military sim
510	1	a	I rate this game I-S, for Insense and Stressful.  &gt;be playing Epoch mod with a friend &gt;find this nice Taru helicopter &gt;find a truck &gt;go to tow said truck &gt;lifting off with the truck hanging under us &gt;lower rotor breaks and goes into the red for absolutely no reason &gt;Taru starts spinning out of control &gt;freaking out as friend tries to safely navigate what is essentially a spinning rock from the air to the ground without murdering us &gt;five minutes of cardiac arrest-inducing stress later and we safely land &gt;get out to assess damage &gt;get shot dead &gt;10/10 would play again
4422	1	a	Beautifull game  But my PC is piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥. and there for everything must run on Standard During Online gameplay.
2342	1	a	For all those people out there who think CoD and Battlefield are noch tactical enough Arma 3 is the game of choice. Awesome Multiplayer action for example in King of the Hill and the great modifications (Breaking Point, Altis Life) make this game my #1 at the moment.
533	1	a	Good single player, great coop multiplayer...when it works. The servers are rather sketchy, they don't run very well and there are hackers waiting to ruin your experience. Just this past week one of the servers was hacked 3 times! But, it is fun and when you get on a server that is good it is worth all the trouble. But, the most annoying thing to me is this has only been out for a year or so and the coop servers are already kinda dead and this is dissapointing. Most people only play Altis Life, the role playing section of the game, which I'd rather just play GTA online. If this is on sale, buy it. Wouldn't shell out the full $60 on it though. If you love tactical games such as Ghost Recon and Rainbow Six, this is your game. All in all 8/10.
2471	1	a	The pre-eminent military simulator. Multi-player and the mod community are where this game shine. Incredibly deep and sometimes frustratingly buggy, persevering lends a rich experience.
3915	1	a	its like Jesus had a baby and it took over the world. Yes its that good.
2198	1	a	Awesome game! just awesome is all i have to say about this game
213	1	a	Successfully vaulted my way up a big rock. Shortly after I slid down the rock and fell to my death.  10/10 realistic rock physics.
2812	1	a	Probably my favorite game. i give it a 8/8, its great m8.
2278	1	a	Less hollywood, more tactics.   Features and Pros: - 3 Campaigns. - Edit your own SP/MP missions. - Over 100 player online games (including co-op). - Huge map (I'm not kidding). - Drivable vehicles including jets and submarines. - Massive mod community. - Impressive visuals. - Night and day cycle. - Encourages tactical executions (get it wrong and you're all dead).  Cons: - Steep learing curve. - Although the effects are good, fire fights may not satisfy those who want a BF4 type experience. - AI can be frustratingly dumb at times, but are not bad most of the time. - Automatic spotting (as far as I'm aware, you can't manually spot an enemy).  Note: - Tanks and helicopters may seem over powered. This is because in real life they are. It forces weaker forces to adjust their engagement methods to succeed; Hit and run could be one of them.
2425	1	a	The most dangerous things in Arma 3 are as follows. -Stairs -AI -Rocks -Teammates -The car you are driving -The Enemy
2958	1	a	Love this game! just need more firends to play it!
3347	1	a	best Military simulation game ever!!  10/10!   
4306	1	a	Great game and a must buy for in the summer sale!!
4888	1	a	This game. this game is ballayoloswag420
2842	1	a	Arma 3 is amazing. While the story is a bit bland in some parts, jump on any combat servers and you'll have a blast.   Pros -Amazing weapon/vehicle system -Destruction (Nothing like BF4, but its good) -Doesn't run like a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ (Like Arma 2 or Dayz) -Amazing game engine, more pretty than Arma 2 and optomized better. -Lots of gamemodes, including Altis Life and Wasteland  Cons -World's Most Original Story  -On servers, the fps is determined by server fps. -Hard to spot Ai (Maybe thats just me) -Killed pretty easily (Again, maybe thats just me)  Overall, it's a pretty good game. Pick it up on a sale if you can or want.  8/10
1495	1	a	This game is well worth the money, I can out countless hours of my time playing this. So far a good choice as I love playing Atlis life all the time.. and King Of The Hill.. Hopefully you can enjoy the game as much as I do.
3609	1	a	I think I need to spend much more hours in it.
3095	1	a	10/10
3959	1	a	Glitchy as hell but addictive
9	1	a	10/10 Another way to ruin your social life if it already wasn't ruined to begin with.
833	1	a	Ok, lets face the facts, this game is quite a bit of money, but it is totaly worth it.
1658	1	a	Now let me say this once, if you have any AMD processor please stay away, any Rp server, King Of The Hill, or wasteland server, you will get 15-30 FPS no higher, BUT. Anyways besides the optimization, this game is probably the most detailed military simmulators I have played. There is so much content everywhere and so much to do and explore. To Roleplay servers, to headshoting someone 1k with a LRR, there is just so much to offer, for 60 bucks its like your buying 10 different games, with the possibilty to MOD. Games like Breaking Point,exile, all availible with one game, this game is truly amazing. Every pro player would most likely have 1.5k hours on this game because its amazing. Its easy to get lost in the community because there is so many people apart of it. I have 1700 Hours and every hour was well spent with friends and the community. It takes some time to get used to but it is truly an amazing experience, this game defines the reason I still play PC games today! So if you have a Intel processor, i5 or above, even some i3's get this game and play the living hell out of it. Find some friends, because it becomes amazing expereince.
1902	1	a	Arma 3 - Where the minimum requirements are made up and your PC specs don't matter.  10/10 would average 30 FPS again.
552	1	a	best tactical game ever
243	1	a	Um so to get this start.  â¢ Massive Desync  â¢ More Desync  â¢ Lets throw in some lag  â¢ Your friends offroad just decided to fly  â¢ FPS drop  â¢ Shotty Hitboxes  â¢ They â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up the sounds so now every gun sounds like a BB gun and you can't tell which direction the incoming fire is.  â¢ Third looking over a wall to find your target in a military realism simulator  â¢ Apparently the entire maps of Altis and Statis are quarries cause thats the only reason I can think of why there is a minefield of â¥â¥â¥â¥ing large rocks scattered every 50m.  â¢ Please don't make us pay 16$ for every new scatterbug dlc idea you guys come up with.  â¢ Why the â¥â¥â¥â¥ does 5 feet fall kill me and why havn't the developers fixed this issue that has plagued the past 2 games?  â¢ Why do I phase into rocks when I try to walk on them and why do I have to vault to get past a tree?  â¢ Your car is made out of carboard.  â¢ 3=============&gt;~~~~~~~~  â¢ One last thing... More desync  10/10 Welcome to FPS HELL
3090	1	a	There's something about Bohemia's world-building that inspires people. Importantly though, Arma 3's vanilla content now stands on equal footing with those third-party inspirations. It's still a little rough around the edges, but it's a darned impressive package nonetheless.
1996	1	a	Alright I think its time I do my part and write a review on Arma 3, I've been playing the Arma series since the DayZ mod was released, it's in all honesty why I even got into PC gaming, now with Arma 3 being released a couple years later with way better graphics, physics, VON, mods, ect. I could not stop playing. I still play Arma 3 till this day, and sorry for the short review, gotta go play.
394	1	a	This game is fun to play any time, army simulator not just a fps but more
3993	1	a	not enough content wtf?
1217	1	a	Awesome game. Already played it for 1700+ hours, and it doesnt get boring ;). The Apex DLC is really good aswell.
4729	1	a	Arma III is a very complex game and requires a little bit of a powerful computer to run the game but with all that said there is many more positive things about this game such as its wonderful community, the mechanics of this game, the strategy and close quarters and long range fun fights that are very intsense and the ammount of mods there are that are a availible with this game.  Some of my favourite mods and gamemodes for this game include: -Arma III Life mod -Wasteland -Dayz (epoch and overwatch) -Sector Control (aslo known as King of the Hill)  Pros: -Graphics are beautiful with extreme detail. -Variety of guns and open world exploration. -Realistic Combat.  Cons: -Controlls feel a little bit clunky at first but you will get used to it over time. -Some technical issues. -Takes a good computer to run this game and get 60fps.
2252	1	a	Id â¥â¥â¥â¥ the â¥â¥â¥â¥ on this game any day of the week m8. almost onpar with victoria bitter so that's â¥â¥â¥â¥in' sayin something m8.  m8 play it and if you don't like it you are a â¥â¥â¥â¥in gypsy.
3663	1	a	This game can be cancerous at times, but its really fun when you run from cops on a go cart.
391	1	a	The sandals are fabulous!
966	1	a	Arma 3 is an expansive military simulator that excels beyond any game I can think of off the top of my head in both realism and graphics. As a PC gamer it is practically a requirement to get this game (assuming you like FPS).  It is really fun and is potentially a mix of an FPS, RPG and Military simulator (with sandbox!)  The Steam Workshop adds tons more content as well such as missions, racing mods, and pretty much anything you can think of...
4240	1	a	Got together with some friends, decided that our lives were limited to picking cocaine. Nothing else in life was working. Girlfriends dumped us, failed out of school, in debt to the government. Now I am living the life, got ourselves some vehicles, a warehouse, started a gang and are now ruling the streets with a force. Enough so that now instead of just blasing 'â¥â¥â¥â¥ Da Police,' we are literally â¥â¥â¥â¥ING them. 11/10
4796	1	a	Fun army simulator game, although I play it for the RPG city life element. It's also less buggy in comparison to it's predecessor, ArmA 2.
1593	1	a	Decent game, most addicting one I have played so far. Super fun gamemodes, definately would recommend for anyone who likes military style games, and survival type games.
2340	1	a	
1961	1	a	awsome game
5178	0	a	Lost of bugs. Crashes a lot and if you cant get it going soon (its a bit complicated and will take you a minute to figure it out) you end up playing 'past your refund time played'. I spent hours trying to research maps i can actually play. Thanks steam.
4726	1	a	i still dont know how to play this game
4237	1	a	great game to play with your friends
877	1	a	Gameplay and sound effects are great, this is a good military simulator, campaign has a great story but no replay value except for the last mission of Ep 3: Win. Editor is very smooth and easy to use.
2311	1	a	I've been waiting for a game like this my whole life without even knowning it. Quite possibly the best shooting game ever made.
2688	1	a	It's an amazing game. The campaign wasnot boring at all and some Co-ops are challaning and fun. But it needs massive PVP official mods/games , more complex maps(or objects) and official co-ops which is as good as the campaign.
2362	1	a	It's great.
4522	1	a	Best game ever you can play as a rabbit. 100/10 masterpice!
3677	1	a	Awesome game! The best you can get in Mil-Sim! Recommend high powered CP though. Takes a good graphics card.
1396	1	a	I bought the game for Altis Life and I have never looked back.
3191	1	a	i was on the fence about this game thinking it was gonna be like another call of duty. So i held out, watched twitch and read reviews. Finnaly the game went on sale and i decided to buy it. I almost regret not getting it sooner. This game is addicting
5045	1	a	My first Experience with Atlas Life Multiplayer-  1. Logged On 2. Cop pulls me over, asks if i am a criminal, then leaves 3. Second cop pulls me over and in the deepest voice imaginable says: YA KNOOW WERE TO BUY SOME DRUGGGGSS? Then leaves when he sees the other cop coming back. 4. A Cop pulls over a car near me, the guy gets out and shoots the cop without taking, then drives away 5. I steal the cop car 6. I get arrested 7. 2 mins later i am set free 8. Guy that killed the cop makes me join his gang 9. He buys me guns 10. He reveals he is the owner 11. We raid the police station 12. I die 13. I leave, stunned that all this happend it under 10 minutes.  10/10 Would become a Flabbergasted noob again.
1879	1	a	This game took thousands of hours out of my life... jk rofl #freeweekend in 2014. Im basically a pro now, buy my mix tape
3425	1	a	There is the type of gamer who loves realistic games, then theres those players who want to be a bulldog style being, and â¥â¥â¥â¥ a tank with a baby 'lil 'nade
3695	1	a	Great game, but heavy for many PC!
1063	1	a	already running it better than arma 2.
3710	1	a	  This game is fun to play but it has steep learning curve. And some may say dlc are must and that's somewhat the case but personally I don't regret buying any of them.
4206	0	a	Shot the floor only to have the bullet bounce from the ground and hit my friend in the head This feature is heavily overlooked But beacuse of this we arent friends anymore thanks Arma 3
2066	1	a	Bought Game Join Random Altis Life Server Find Admin Named Zac Zac Gives Me 25k+ Worth Of Gear Knocked Out By Zac's Friend He Steals My Kidney We Find Spainards He Steals THEIR Kidneys We Drive To The Black Market I Get Out To Only Get Knocked Out Again He Steals My Other Kidney I Get Up like Its Nothing Take HIs Kidney And Run Away To Zac Spainards Have Guns He Kills The Spainards  Zac Yells At Him He Walks To Me Knocks Me Out Steals Another Kidney From Me   11/10 - Would Loose 3 Kidneys Again!
3123	1	a	Arma 3 is a great game that deserves more attention. The only downside, is that you need a Jet Engine to run this game.  10/10
5088	0	a	Year 2060: Intel I7 85326k 64 Cores - 512 GHZ nVidia GTX 3840 ti 128GB DDR12  Battlefield 30 - 150-200 FPS COD 50 - 150-200 FPS GTA 10 - 150-175 FPS Arma 3 - 20-59 FPS
5182	1	a	7/10  Single player is fine. Mods can make SP a fun experience. But once you try MP, that's a solid no unless you play wasteland or on a private server. The FPS on any server running a custom game mode is terrible. It is higly unlikely you will get above 30 FPS on a public server. I can't speak for private servers but if you want to play MP, play wasteland or find a group that has their own not-bad private server.  Only recommended because of SP
4568	1	a	+â¥â¥â¥â¥ ton of content, community content of course. -not allowed to pick up â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ DLC GUNS IF YOU KILLS SOMEONE
930	1	a	This MilSim blows CoD, BF, and CS:GO out of the water with PCMLs, A-10s, UAVs, T-100s, and rocks.  Ladies and gentlemen, War in the 21st Century  *BATTLEFIELD BUZZ PFFFFF PFFFF PFFFFFFF*
1297	1	a	Yes with over 20 guns and 12 vehicles I r8 8/8
1198	1	a	  It is totally amazing game
1904	1	a	Breaking Point mod is better than the vanilla gameplay 10/10
2647	1	a	Probably the most realistic game out there, Well most of the time... great for hours of fun. I have played Arma since Arma 2 free.
305	0	a	It's fun but for the time it's been out it should be a lot less buggy than it is. I don't think the devs care about this game anymore. I'd recommend SQUAD instead of this anyday
4841	1	a	Best real life combat simulator hands down there is no better foot, land, air and sea Arma series does it like no other game I have played.  Player made addons and missions making this game stand like the leaning tower of pisa it may not be perfect but it does look and feel great.
3396	1	a	Really good game to play with your friends. Although I was playing on a server and it seemed to have max players on it (There was 2 servers) and my browser seemed to stop working after a while.... so i had to restart the whole game then refresh a couple of times then it would stop again. Thats really the only probelem, the co-op is amazing - It almost reminds me of Planetside 2 when you have a squad and there are mortar strikes and everything works out... Anyway, I would recomend this game to alot of my friends :-)
26	1	a	A game from back when RTS games were still riding high, when 'base building' wasn't a dirty word and factions were meant to be colourful and fun. It shows its age now, but the core mechanics are still solid.  An unusual characteristic of an RTS was persistency; or how your play affected you in the next game. AOE III had experience gain over time that would unlock 'cards', which then could be called into play in a future match. This also came with nice cosmetic upgrades for a 'capital' city, which let players really feel that they were leading an army into battle. Sadly these cosmetic upgrades were not in place for Asian or American civilizations in the expansions, although the persistant card unlocks are still present.  The factions are nicely done. The European factions all largely play the same, with some emphasis on artillery, cavalry, or infantry between them. Asian civilizations are also fairly similar, just implementing 'wonders' as well as other minor changes. I do like the emphasis on the Americans, who end up playing much more differently as they lack the hard defenses that others do. Overall these different factions make for a high level of replayability.  An old game, but worth the money. Especially since newer quality RTSs are infrequent.
705	1	a	Good game, lots of mods.  35Â£ for 3,1k hours of fun, sounds fair to me.
4317	1	a	briefcase flung me in air n kill me 11/10 wud buy again
1453	1	a	Same ole Arma, if you enjoy the series, its worth a buy. Active multiplayer community
3408	1	a	The only game where the bots have aimbot.
3794	1	a	This game is a dream come true for me! This is probably the most realistic combat simulator I have ever played! Being able to play on real, photo accurate locations is really fun, and awesome, especially when you take the vast size of the maps into consideration! My favorite part of this game are the 2D and 3D editor tools that are provided with the game, it allows you to create just about any scenario you can think of! Have you ever wanted to experience a stealth night operation as a scuba diver, and wipe out patrols? Or have you ever wanted to experience a full on war with combined operations, such as hundreds of ground units, armored vehicles, and aircraft? OR have you ever wanted to design a fortress that you and your AI team has to defend from hundreds of invading enemies? Well, all of this and much MUCH more is possible with the easy to use editor tools!  Also, I have come to the conclusion that Arma 3's AI is the most advanced, versitile, and smartest AI than any other game has to offer, I was extremely surprised when I hand-placed a bunch of jets in an airbase, to see the AI know how to actually taxi the jets to the runway strip, and take off in an orderly fashion without running into each other or other obstacles during the whole process!! Also, I didn't even place any waypoints or create any scripts for them, it was all the AI!!! The AI can adapt to pretty much any situation, and will follow orders from you if you are the leader of the group. Plus, it is really fun to watch independent AI squads battle it out without your interactions, the AI squad leaders will actually command their units (even you if you are part of their squad!) in any situation!  The multiplayer is very fun, you can play in a variety of servers that could involve capturing territories, fighting AI, role playing, combined operations with over a hundreds of players, or all of the above combined!!  Lastly, this is more of a thank you towards Bohemia Interactive: As someone who strongly supports the United States Military, and has 3 brothers in the Army, I thank you for your bold, brave, and admirable move, to not include female soldiers in this game, I understand that society is trying to move in that 'accepting', 'politically correct', and 'equality' direction, but this whole movement is proving to be VERY troublesome and problematic for the United States Military. Ask any American male soldier who has actually fought in combat overseas, what they think of allowing female soldiers fight by their sides, they will ALL say that it is not good, and that they rather keep females off the battlefields. Unfortunately, American society doesn't understand the fact that females naturally do not have the capability of controlling their emotions under stressful and dangerous situations as well as males can. There have been MANY recorded events that involve female soldiers putting their battle partners in grave danger during combat situations due to letting their emotions control them. I understand that this is just a video game, but it still does matter A LOT what developers do with their games, because you would be really surprised how many young men and women go to enlist for the military just because of movies or video games, honestly, it is really quite sad.  So thank you Bohemia Interactive, for making such a good game, you guys are making excellent bold moves, which I believe sets a great example of how other developers should operate, and not fall into the common traps set by society. Thank you!  James Glenn
4746	1	a	GREAT GAME !!! I LOVE IT EVEYTHING ABOUT IT IS REALLY AWSOME!!
2691	1	a	My name is Dry, and i approve of this game. :P
3965	1	a	Arma 3 brings so much different game types to the table. From Altis Life which is a crazy GTA Online style clone that is better, to full on war simulator with ari, land, troops. There is so much to do in this game. If you can't find something to do in this game then you need to get to a Doctor quick... cause you might be dead. :) Enjoy.
4255	1	a	make even less friends than in arma 2 since more people play it and they don't want you on the helecopters even if you promise you'll be nice
2611	1	a	Real Life Cartel 10/10 Would scream Allau Akhbar again
2166	1	a	I developed PTSD
496	1	a	Drove really fast in a tank and flipped it 10 outta 10 for best tanks.
3250	1	a	This game took my virginity! i rate this 9 out of 11 because yolo.
2934	1	a	Arma 3 is a game I like for the vehicles and all the awesome MP games and mods, particularly Altis Life. You need a pretty beefy computer to play it well, and if you can manage that, it's a very rewarding and fun game.
4019	1	a	it ok till u hit fence then gota walk 20k
1999	1	a	Good Milism game. Not the most realistic, but it's very hardcore and fun. Definetly made for multiplayer and mods. If you buy this, make sure to try out these game modes, King of the Hill, Wasteland, Exile, and Variations of these with different maps and mods.
876	1	a	I have played this game for over a year now and I can honestly say it is fantastic. There are so many mods that improve the game and add amazing new content. An example of this would be the DayZ mod called Exile. But there are plenty of fun things you can do in this game like playing life servers that don't require mods. The new DLC called apex is set to come out in a week or two and it adds a crazy new map and I can't wait for it. There is so much to do on multiplayer and there are so many populated servers that have really fun modes that you can play alone or with friends. Additionally, the vehicles, both land and air, are really well designed, easy to drive and fun to use. Plus the upcoming DLC is adding VTOLs that look amazing! I would honestly recommend this game.
4919	1	a	Buy it now :)
3590	1	a	10/10 would waste 1000 hours again :D
5399	1	a	my favrate game recomended at six stars
1348	1	a	this is one of the most badass games i've played in the last 3 years
1853	1	a	You'll definately lose your girlfriend.
2089	1	a	awesome game. make sure to get breaking point for it
2585	1	a	Really awesome game, i give it a 10/10 for gameplay. There are still many issues with this game though. You constantly fall through stairs and break your legs randomly. You just have to be really careful with stairs.
220	1	a	Buy this game and download Breaking point mod. So fu*king epic!! Just love it!
2481	1	a	Great game
4695	1	a	Worth every penny. Fantastic military simulator.
2933	1	a	It's very cool game, with alot of action, there is also mod's where you can play, Real Life - Altis Life, Dayz Overpoch, Breaking point, and alot of other mods :)
1703	1	a	I like every thing about arma 3, all the mods you can download and everything you can add to your map and its just an all round beautiful game
4774	0	a	I purchased the Delux Edition expecting the DLC to be included.. Well its NOT inluded, OK, fine its 2 helicopters and the carts suck, i can live without them..  BUT !!!!! WHY THE HELL do i have to see adds for the DLC while I am in game...????????? The ADD's are big massive translucent helmets tilled across my game screen with a large popup window in the centre of my screen that appear every 5 odd min, and you cant get rid of em unless you select L/â¥â¥â¥â¥+P..    
3157	1	a	Great for Individual play and for large group play. Great DLC's and many gamemodes.
4988	1	a	shot my friends helicopter and it leaked all its fuel  10/10
3316	1	a	Massive Improvement since the last game which I've been playing for about 4 years.
2710	1	a	10/10
423	1	a	By far one of the best , or even THE best FPS game i've played in a long, long time.
4772	1	a	Arma 3 is my favorite simulation game I have played on Steam. It's fun to play and you won't get tired of it. The workshop is amazing for Arma there are always lots of missions to play. The helicopters and jets are fun to fly around in. I don't like that there are limited amounts of weapons (so if you want more guns you need to download a mod.), there is also no melee attacks. over all Arma 3 is a really fun game and I highly recommend this game.
1652	1	a	A 125mm tank shell's explosive work can be fixed by a bandage 10/10 - IGN I wasn't paid for those ratings
3473	1	a	Arma 3 &amp; Dayz r not just a normall games to play , it's a life to live .
1581	1	a	The Arma physics are hilarious.
4350	1	a	Arma 3 is like anal, Hard and painful, but you'll get used to it.
417	1	a	Arma 3 beautifully continues the legacy of the Arma franchise. At no point in this game did I not stop to take in where I was. Altis and Stratis, the two maps, are stunning. The main map, Altis is very large and just that perspective alone is astounding.   If you are playing Arma for the first time, I HIGHLY recommend playing around with the editor and single player before delving in online. This is not a pick up and play type of game. There are aspects that take some time to get accustomed to and you will not get it your first time playing.   I cannot wait to see what modders have to offer in the coming months and years to make this game even better.   
398	1	a	The most amazing military simulator game out there! Also a great game un-modded as well as modded. This game has brought many players together through communities and clans! 10/10 No Doubt. Well done Bohemia!
1514	1	a	Arma has always been in my mind after i bought arma 2 and arma 2 operation arrowhead. theres a lot of features u cant get in other games than arma 3 so 9/10 would put my money in to this!
327	1	a	Must Play with a clan. Totally worth the money if played like that.
4921	1	a	supeer funny and super realistic
735	1	a	The amount of Community mods available really makes this a worthwile purchase.  There are so many different game mods and modes, it's like purchasing 10 different games.

2247	1	a	recommended, awnsome game!!!
3728	1	a	Amazing game, but its not for everyone.  :)
2431	1	a	This Game is a fun open world game if you have money and you like military play this GAME
1391	1	a	My initial review said that ArmA 3 would be a great game by late 2014 when more mods and content were released. I am glad to say that this became true several months before I expected.  Between the incredible Zeus game mode (an on-the-fly mission creator) and excellent mods like Advanced Gameplay Mod, Task Force Radio and ALiVE this is one of the best co-op games available. You will need at least 4-5 people to really have fun in multiplayer, but there's really no other game that offers what ArmA does.
4361	1	a	This game is the worst game i have ever played, i had the game and it uninstalled itself and then took 4 months to download ( totally not my wifi) and it is very annoyinh having to download all of the â¥â¥â¥â¥ING mods, so over all 10/10, great game, must buy.
3688	1	a	With proper mods and good community, this is the only war game you need.
4611	1	a	Unlike Arma 2 , Arma 3 can give much more. Not that Arma 2 is bad its just that Arma 3 is like gmod. If you want to play DarkRP you join a server other than downloading the addons and only picking from a small ammount of servers sometimes. Along with the ease of access to the numerous amounts of gamemodes it also has a certian play style to it.
3943	1	a	This game takes practice and boy once you become fairly skilled this game really begins to kick off, the game does well to teach you things using a fun story mode and extra tutorials. This game has an alright community and i love the DLC!
3215	1	a	Without mods pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥  With mods best game ever 9/11
4544	1	a	I knew what to expect going into Arma III from previous experience with Bohemia Interactive games, yet I was still overwhelmed by the amount of features I had to wrap my head around before I could play it with even moderate proficiency. Itâs a first-person shooter alright, but itâs not another âleft trigger to aim down the sights, right trigger to shootâ kind of game. Youâre going to have to use almost every key on your keyboard, memorize specific key combinations and what each does depending on whether youâre on foot, in a tank, a helicopter, etc.  I felt comically inept fumbling through my first few hours. With so many different firing modes, stances, movement speeds, and other options, I had difficulty just walking, drawing my weapon and firing, to say nothing of using my equipment, making sense of the map, and working with my squad. I had to wonder what my AI squadmates thought of me, the clueless rookie, stumbling into the bushes before I accidently pulverized myself with a satchel charge I didnât even mean to deploy.  To make matters even more difficult, in its current state Arma III doesnât offer a real tutorial. Its Showcases (playable scenarios showing off its many features) follow a logical progression that introduce you to increasingly complicated mechanics. However, they each do a poor job of explaining how to use them or how they may be useful later on. The only real instruction comes in the form of on-screen hints that tell you which keys do what. Itâs an inefficient method to teach you how to fly a helicopter, and practically useless when it comes to explaining the tactical value of more esoteric equipment and features.  In one of the more interesting Showcases you are given access to a non-lethal aerial drone and an armed ground vehicle drone which you can use to eliminate targets in a nearby town. After much experimentation, I devised a tactic of sending my aerial drone ahead to scout and tag targets, which then allowed me to coordinate mortar fire and corner enemies in the town. It was satisfying because it allowed me come up with a strategy which felt entirely my own, and one which nearly no other shooter could accommodate. On the other hand, there was a needless amount of frustration along the way that could have been avoided with clearer UI and better instruction.  As you can imagine, Arma IIIâs potentially much more enjoyable when youâre playing online with real people â especially those who already know how to play and can teach us its secrets. It doesnât have a capped player limit, so in theory a server where 100 players are facing another 100 players in a gigantic sandbox where almost everything is possible is one of the best shooters Iâve ever played. But without investing long-term in a clan or other group that will ensure a reliable team of significant size, those are hard to come by. In practice, new players are presented with a list of servers half-full of random people who arenât communicating, and where everything that can go wrong is going wrong. Since Arma III doesnât offer obvious incentives for players to cooperate or even funnel them to the same areas of its enormous maps, multiplayerâs mostly uncurated chaos. Itâs amusing in its own way, but something I would rather watch in a YouTube video than it play myself.  Counterintuitively, smaller matches are more fun for a new player trying to find his way in this world. In one pick up co-op game, six fellow players and I (and a group of AI bots) were tasked with a simple mission: find a way off the island. We spawned at a random spot along the coast and were given two locations, miles away, where we could find a boat or a helicopter for extraction. We ended up not even making it halfway to either destination, but I enjoyed our journey quite a lot. We heard a gunship in the distance and dashed across a field to take cover in a forest. We stumbled upon and successfully seized an enemy outpost, where we commandeered a truck. We arrogantly tried repeating the same strategy with a larger town on our way to an airfield... and were caught in the open by snipers. This is what developers mean when they talk about emergent gameplay, and itâs where Arma III shines.  Altis and Stratis, the two islands that serve as its massive military sandboxes (270 kmÂ² and 20 kmÂ² respectively), are truly impressive and the foundations that make everything else about ARMA 3 possible. Whether youâre scuba diving to disable mines or sniping from a church atop a high hill, everything looks crisp and sufficiently believable... as long as you donât look too close. Thereâs an obvious amount of recycled assets used to fill all this space, and many empty buildings. With its overall clinical style, Arma III can seem sparse, even boring when you stop to smell the roses.  Its sound design, however, is disappointing at any distance. It suffers from laughably cheesy electronic music and sound effects that make some actions feel insignificant, vehicle movement and firing in particular. For all I know thatâs what tanks and helicopters really sound like, but it makes them feel like toys.  But like I said, this is a game where we have to make our own fun, and at least Arma III makes that much relatively easy with a built-in mission editor and Steam Workshop integration. Itâs inherited the modding community that brought us such hits as DayZ, and as its marketing materials insist, Arma III really is a âplatformâ more than a stand-alone game, and what it may evolve into in the months and years after release adds immeasurable replay value to its $60 asking price.  Arma IIIâs complexity is a double-edged sword. It takes a long time to comprehend, but once youâre comfortable enough with its mechanics to take advantage of them under pressure, youâre able to engage in a kind of large-scale tactical combat thatâs simply not offered elsewhere. Weak sound and a sparsely decorated map are forgivable, making Arma IIIâs nearly endless content definitely worth experiencing as long as you know thereâs a long, dark tunnel to get through before you can see the light.
5300	1	a	So let me tell you a story. There's little old me Just wondering through the amazing countryside as you do. The colours were amazing the lighting and sounds were great, I just met up with my friend and we were having a great time.

382	0	a	Got the game recently (having never played an Arma game) and although i had heard that the controls were difficult i was willing to spend the time learning them, what got me is that as soon as you enter the multiplayer, you hit walls upon walls of text that the game doesn't tell you anything about.I understand most of it is user-created content but that doesn't stop it from being incredibly confusing joining a server and being told little to nothing about what is going on, you just know its either 'Altis Life' or 'King Of The Hill' etc. It kinda makes you think they could've done with a few tutorial servers with different game modes so new players aren't extremely confused from the off.  Well the first time i went in to a multiplayer game (in a server about 2/3rds full) the chat channels were completely dead, all i heard was what presumably was a fellow noob constantly saying 'Hello' (There was someone else talking occasionally but the sound quality was so grainy i couldnt make out anything he was saying) . I figure everyone is on the teamspeak server as from what I'd heard 'everyone uses ts on Arma' but nowhere in game did it say where the name/address of the ts server and when i asked in the sidechat the other lobby members told me to stop using sidechat. Similar experiences occurred on the few other servers i tried going on as well. The game shows a complete lack of effort to help anyone who has never played an ARMA game before, how to play the online, and the people playing it seem antisocial and uninterested in helping either.  Judging from some of the reviews. the campaign isn't very good either but at least its playable, I'll probably end up on that for a bit in the hope that one day, if i ever manage to get my head around the multiplayer, i won't get constantly mowed down and showed up for the complete noob i am at this game! Overall probably a good game for those new to the Arma series if you have a spare 20 odd hours you are willing to put in to figure out the what is going on in the online game modes, what addons and mods you will need for the game, what ts servers you need to be in, what the controls are, then you will probably reach a stage where you can enjoy the game. But if you don't have that amount of spare time to search the internet for help guides, tutorials, and server info, then you will probably find the game very frustrating. Not at all noob friendly.
2920	1	a	Realistic as â¥â¥â¥â¥.. get this game.. its a really good game, it has jets, helicopters, submarines, tanks and stuff.. its really good fun :D
3264	1	a	its a good game the only problem is arma 3 life dosent work unless you have tons of mods 
3142	1	a	Although ARMA 3 offers a diverse amount of game types and a wide selection of mods, if you are looking for fast paced 'shoot-em-up' play style this game is not for you. A typical night in ARMA can involve long periods of boredom interspersed with some of the most intense firefights possible in a video game. I highly recommend this game to anyone that is interested in a more realistic military shooter or someone that is looking to enjoy one of the many alternate gametypes/mods that ARMA offers.
546	1	a	very loud indoor sounds with army men with big loud guns who shoot and kill you without even seeing you and why do i need to press every key on my keyboard in a certain order just to reload nothing makes any sense also war dads who take this game very seriously and will get mad if you call their squad lame and say yours is better and cooler
968	1	a	This is a really good game if you like war sims and just fooling around on a big map with lots of weps and cars.  BOTTOM LINE its just fun
829	1	a	love the graphics in this game and how real life it is
4397	1	a	Another rip-off of all of the popular good games, such as FNaF, Minecraft, Garry's Mod and Pokemon Go.  In Arma, you play as a man or a woman, which is strike one of this game since there are NO OTHER GENDERS TO PLAY!!!!! What you do in this game is shoot and survive, as well and try to eventually get to the end of the campaign, which is the same thing you do in Minecraft. There is even crafting if you get mods! This game wants to be like Minecraft!  Five Nights at Freddy's comes in at night time. You walk around trying to avoid other harmful cisgenders, or sit in your base (like in FNaF) and try not to die. This is a carbon copy of FNaF at night time, yet it costs twice if not thrice as much.  Then there's Garry's Mod RP when you play a mode called Altis Life. IT'S THE SAME THING! THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THE GRAPHICS, AND IT'S WORSE THAN DARKRP! You have to grind for hours just to get a gun license, and when you get the gun you are shot down by police for being black and have to start all over again.  And finally, it also copies pokemon go. In a mode called Wasteland, you walk around on your map trying to collect different vehicles to harm other cis-gender scum, but there are WasteStops, or as they call it in game, 'shops', for you to get the appropriate gear as to set out to find the vehicles. or you can just purchase them, which I think is a Pay2Win aspect and that's why Pokemon Go is better.  In conclusion, this game tries to be what it shouldn't in order to make money.  10/10 game is good
4145	1	a	Great game for any military entusiast.
152	1	a	A really nice game. If you want to play a realistic tactic shooter, Arma 3 is the way to go. Do missions or just have fun in some modes. I would recommend to play this game with at least one friend !
4707	1	a	Arma3 is a great game for anyone wa ting to burn hours From a developer standpoint the game is easy to code so if any devs are reading this and is thinking about being in the Arma 3 community it's good don't worry I'm a dev for Arma 3 and I wouldn't change nothing about it
4033	1	a	Probably the best game out there if you have friends to play it! Endless scenarios and campaigns being added in the workshop. Not recommended for too casual players, quite a learning curve to really understand the game.
527	1	a	first downloaded it, then i thought after 1500 hours with friends LAN and in the editor: this is a great game i should buy it. BEST DECISION EVER!
1542	1	a	This game is great. Unlike most modern shooters, Arma 3's engine and combat mechanics are complete poop. This leaves the most strategic player the victor instead of the player with the best twitch reflex. Rewarding strategy over reflex in a FPS is refreshing.
2965	1	a	Being a big fan of Operation Flashpoint from way back when, this game is a great replacement for it.  If you are tired for the arcade style, casual, fast paced and no skill requirment of modern games. (IE: COD and BF) and want something that requires, skill, timing, know how and realism. Then this is the game for you.  Must like OP:Flashpoint, it isn't for the faint of heart at start. Lots of keys, lots of actions you need to know. But with like anything else, put the time into it and you can do it.  Huge Steam Workshop community, lots of add ons which means more FREE content. Don't like something? Make it yourself.  This game is great fun, though it may not be for all, it's great for most. Think of it as the Eve Online for shooters.  Nothing beats playing MP and being a good transport pilot to get your troops to and from battle or respawns. You can actually make a difference.
579	0	a	I would have done a refund, if it wasn't for Steam's two week limit. If you want to play this game, your face will frequently be attacked by huge popups, shouting 'You can't touch this, it's a DLC'.
784	1	a	The 400 Hours Says it all, a game good even without the fantastic modding community who constantly add too and evolve the game.
3526	1	a	So I joined a terrorist group. After training, I went on our biggest job, where I killed a bunch of enemies with a single jet and they were all in a massive building. Those steel beams didn't hold out. Then I went home and got this game. Pretty good.  9/11 would allahu akbar again
242	1	a	Launch goats to space with huge amounts of Explosives. 10/10.
2542	1	a	10/10
3692	1	a	ONE OF THE FUNNIEST GAMES YOUR EVER PLAY no lie you wont regret this purchase hmu if you wanna play sometimes
3503	1	a	Best MilSim out there yet. Truly recommend it! Great game for those interested in teamwork play and so on :D
3107	1	a	a game really worth getting if your to mod it or just chill in the wasteland servers or just go on king of the hill
4908	1	a	10/10. Would walk 6km and get one-shotted again.
3504	1	a	Played Altis Life.  Cop chased me, I turn corner, stop. He turns corner, pops tires on a bush. I hoon it. Got away 10/10
4882	0	a	I want to like this, but I just can't. The controls aren't nearly intuitive enough, especially switching through the aiming modes, which seem to only work half the time with no explanation? The campain starts by putting red squares around the enemy, then without explanation completely drops this behavior, leaving you to have to visually locate and identify the enemy that are camo'ed and prone all around you, all while they can spot you from miles away and snipe you to death without you even knowing where they were. I gave up after the guy I was following was blown up and have no desire to return to this mess of a game. Maybe the mods/multiplayer are better, but the campain start is such utter crap I can't even bring myself to keep this installed.
874	1	a	Do you want Realism? Well let me tell you in simple details how fuc**** awesome this game is!!! Sure, a few glitches and errors but when you get it, You'll say its all worth the investment. This simulator beats all of the other Armed Assualt series.... by Graphics... meaning; texture,terrain, and others. The sound is.... GREAT, just needs a little tweak. Customization for soldiers... wicked!!! I would recommend this game by my fullest ability. No game can beat the realism of this game. 'It's just simply Astonishing &amp; Jaw-Dropping'
3225	1	a	11/10. One of the best military sims out there (In my opinion.) Plus the controls are better compared to ArmA 2. :P
5388	1	a	fantastic shooter/milatary sim butstill need to fix mini bugs but they dont really matter :D
4180	0	a	the campaign in this game is by far one of the absolute worst games i have ever played in my life, if not it is THE absolute worst game ever, horrible hit detection, cheap deaths, and terrible weapon sway make the campaign virtualy unplayable. I am a soldier in real life, not a reservist, a full time reg force soldier and with my experience in the army i can seriously tell you that this game is faaaaaaaaar from being realistic, i hate this game i cant beleive i spent 70 bucks on it it worth about 2 dollars in my opinion. dont buy this game you WILL be dissapointed.  LMFAO ive played every mode of this game now and its sooooooo broken its hilariouse i cant beleive this game sells and that people actually play it WORST GAME EVER!!!!!!!
1661	1	a	It's a great game.
4540	1	a	Good game to play with friends but if you don't have friends you can find a lot of friends in the server 10/10 would buy again
561	1	a	Awesome game I hope they improve on it more though
955	1	a	Its the best game ever, appart from Halk-Life 1
2323	1	a	think its a good game but you need a good pc to play this game but apart from that its a good decent game
1910	1	a	best war game because there's no run &amp; gun but you have to be water and turn into cup
1432	1	a	best teamplay game i ever seen :)  15/10  +Graphic +Singleplayer +Multiplay &lt;3
4890	1	a	its so good add a f15 f16 and c17s
4297	1	a	Do you like fast playing games? Do you like simple games? Do you like games where you can kill everyone you see?  If you answered yes, than this is not the game for you!  This is a game for someone that wants to feel like he is in a real war. Here you don't shoot if you don't have to, you don't have action around every connor and you have to think through every your action.  BEST GAME EVER!!! (Just a little laggy for me so I don't play it anymore.... :(.... )
1945	1	a	10/10
426	1	a	great game 10/10 points
1102	1	a	Good game! The vanilla game on its own is quite nice but with the rapidly growing modding and mission making community it makes this game so much better! Definitely recommend!
3433	1	a	i want to play it so bad 
1321	1	a	great graphics,sound, solid gameplay for the most part. that aside most def. recommend to get this game.....the game itself is awesome........the mods just add to the experience!
3807	1	a	had a cheat on dayz 3 years ago didnt realise i was on this account while buying arma 3 3/3 would buy agian
1616	1	a	Okay, so I have significantly less hours clocked into this game than most review writing players, but I think it's fair to give my first impression. I used to play Arma 2 a little, and it always sort of disappointed me. It was a great idea. A large map, lots of possibilities as to what you can do, and incredible realism and attention to detail. The issue was, the game was really, really, REALLY clunky. Didn't even feel like it was finished, in my opinion. But the idea of it was astounding. I mean, we got DayZ from Arma 2. Then along came Arma 3. It took the great idea that was Arma 2 and made it playable. Fluid animations and improved com chatter alone instantly made a difference. If you haven't played any Arma before, here's a quick rundown, from my experience. It's a game where you can walk two kilometers with no clue as to what your objective is, finally reach your supposed destination, get in a small firefight, and die in the first few seconds. Bullet to the head. Boom, down. No red stuff on your screen, no suppression effects, you're just down before you can even soil your pants. And it's actually incredibly fun. Name another game where travelling itself is enjoyable enough that the firefights are secondary? Maybe you can. I can't. As an example: I'd bought the game a few hours prior and I decided to play off a mod called Hetman: War Stories (Get it if you buy this game, btw). So I boot it up, set the time to midnight, and anxiously await as it loads a random scenario for me. It starts with a panning shot over the wonderfully large island of Altis. It's all lit up in green, like I'm watching from some sort of neato-night-vision-helicopter-thing. Then it types out a small scenario, something about a village and enemy forces and whatever, and I watch in awe as plummet towards the surface and into the eyes of a soldier on the ground. Everything's dark. I switch on my nifty little goggles and everything's lit up: the night sky, the trees around me, the rolling hills in the distance. I see some markers indicating my squad members, and my leader commands me to regroup. I'd love to admire the scenery, but instead I take off down the hill, gawking as I go, and regroup with my AI comrades and head off in the direction the squad leader points. For about thirty minutes or so, we don't see any foot soldiers. Occasionally, a helicopter will whiz overhead, and my buddies would eat the dirt to try and hide from it, so I'd dive down on my belly and hope I don't get shot, squatting in the bamboo-looking reeds and keeping my eyes to the sky. This went on for a while, and the pure tension in conjunction with the scenery immersed me completely. Then we finally get to a village. My trigger finger's getting itchy, and I go sneaking up the side of the hill all gung-ho like while the others are firing up from below. I find a perch in a building's second story and take out a few guys while the others find their way up the hill after me. Then we get in a firefight, with enemies literally on all sides. Everyone's calling out where enemies are, but even with the goggles it's still kinda dark and I can't see, and sure enough I get wounded, clipped in the leg or something. I go down, try to heal myself, and as I do so I see the guy looking down at me, his gun raised. This isn't like a normal video game, where I know my character's going to die so I panic or begrudgingly accept my fate. My stomach dropped. Seriously, like I'd swallowed a brick, and I tried to wriggle away but he managed to land one more lucky shot and end it. Everyone in m squad died except for one, who I switched to and ran to the hills until I could find another group, constantly hearing bullets crack around me the whole way. Okay, that story was long. But the point is, I didn't even last more than, what, 5 minutes in a firefight? And this instantly became one of the best experiences I've ever had in a video game, from the moment I dropped in to the moment my main character, a character with MY NAME, got shot down in a little Mediterranean town in the hills of God-knows-where. Just buy it. The price is high, yes, but if you're going to spend $60 on any game, let it be this one. On a less sentimental note, the modding community's fantastic, and you'll never run out of things to do. Graphics are great as well, and gameplay flows nice with enough functions to feel like you have real control over your character, your squad, your vehicles, everything. Oh, and if you buy it, try to get friends to buy it as well. I know I personally can't lead a squad to save my life yet (honestly, they all die under my command) so having someone to give you pointers and play squad leader in co-op missions would be ideal for sure.  10/10 purely because I can't go any higher.

5384	1	a	Best Military Game 10/10.
406	1	a	Great game. Love Battle Royale and King of th Hill...Recomend Hostile takeover servers for king of the hill.
3030	1	a	10/10 Would pay 60 for the game then turn around and be asked to pay another 60 for the dlc, thought I was playing battle field for a little bit. Tighten up bohemia, i can offord 120+ dollars for this game. The dlc weapons are amazing and without buying the dlc I can use them, and they are a lot better than the vanilla guns for sure. The dlc Ghillie is actually a ghillie cool enough, unlike the vanilla ghillie.
559	1	a	great game takes a lot of power so if you dont have a powerful computer or laptop i would not recommend because it takes alot of power to truly experience
4385	1	a	This game has everything.
4389	0	a	Have that Steam Error 81 and something with Q:00000... I can launch the game but not when I click on play. It pops up a error. Help? anyone? Maby refund next?
4464	1	a	The engine man! get it now!
603	1	a	Really good game, but a little buggy at times.
5183	0	a	Poor Optimization...for the graphics card...  I have a i7-6700k, with a closed loop liquid cooler, HyperX 8GB Ram, and an AMD R9 380. Yet I can't play this game with decent fps on medium settings...going lower makes it about 15fps...which is still unplayable.  Please Bohemia Interactive you need to optimize this game somehow... :'(
4758	1	a	I hit a tree in a tank...The tank didn't survive. 11/10-Ricky's Coffey
619	1	a	I hate the DLC system. You buy a game and can only enjoy a part of the content. I pay money for a complete game not for parts of a game.  Almost wish that pirating will be popular again, so game developers need to deliver great stuff to get the buyers back.  With that said, it's still a good game, but it could have been great!
808	1	a	best multiplayer experience i ever had. the only problem is the fps.
5304	1	a	Arma 3 is the most expensive game on steam. Only people who work at NASA can afford it, this is because you require a degree in quantum physics to be able to remember the controls and move.
3736	1	a	some how i have this game?
1107	1	a	Best game in the world for me ATM.
2779	1	a	Well, look at my game hours.   This game played in vanilla isn't very realistic, i suggest getting a couple mods installed and search for a clan.  Well, in all of my game hours I played in many clans, many gamemods and a lot of ranking up in certain clans.  Have a good game if you'll buy it :)
3064	1	a	Yes it is
4473	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Love playing this game. need to be worked on some more but great game and modding community.
3876	1	a	Best military simulator out there
3227	1	a	This is war and it is amazing. Arma 3 improves on every past Arma game has done and puts it to the max. Aside from the price and sometimes awkward controls Arma 3 is truly astonishing. The campaign is ok but makes up for it with great gameplay and graphical beauty. The multiplayer is great and after you've gotten bored of the base game there's masses of workshop content to entertain you! Overall I'll give Arma 3 a 8.5/10. See you on the frontline!
5306	1	a	TL;DR its a great tactical simulator very well pollished  This is a Mitlitary Silulator Not another C.O.D.   the level of detail is amazing the visuals are stunning.  FPS can be a problem as it is very CPU heavy ( 60fps is achievable but dont expect to be on ultra )  audio is stunning local voip is actually based on player location and rifle sounds effects are great  the workshop is a great aid for mods and extra content very easy to use
1437	1	a	were do I start. this is the best military game I have ever played. most of the gameplay is about the infantry but there are tanks and jets. and if you like call of duty or battlefeld its not really like them missions last hours not 10 minutes over all a pretty good game
637	1	a	Totally worth the 45 euros. Its an incredible game with or without friends..You can have so much fun and never get bored...You could choose any mod and altis life is AMAZING. The bad thing is the performance from the servers...They are really bad. You cant play with 60 fps...Doesnt matter what setup you have. Anyways, i think its still pretty good...Buy it!
128	1	a	 ARMA 3 is one of my favorite video games to date. It's a massive military sandbox with tons of factions, weapons, and vehicles. What's not to like?
4356	1	a	Arma 3, an exelent military simulator, i recommend to anybody who likes the military.
1009	1	a	I know a lot of you are probably looking into this game because it's on sale and you have heard a lot about it. The realism, the tactical team based situations, and the wide variety of wepons are amazing! HOWEVER..... I, the mighty Edgar Allan Bro, have a realistic review for this realistic shooter.  In all honesty, Arma 3 is much more a strategy game than it is an FPS. You have to use your team, depending on the gametype, and you have to plan out your offense. For instance, I was in a Sector Control match on Stratis. My squad was given the order to move through a village and take an enemy heald building. So, we all chose a class type. I picked up an LMG, a buddy of mine took a DMR, and the others had assault rifles and SMGs. I was to give covering fire while my men moved up through the building and cleared it out. We were doing great until an LAV rolled up and shot all of our men out of the building. What we failed to do was make sure one of us had an anti tank/infantry launcher.   You MUST make these decisions in this game. I can't stress this enough. The fanbase is INSANE. If you do something wrong, they will call you out on it. I was shot by a team mate, because I didn't clarify my orders once. The game is a great time to play if you have thick skin and you have a group of friends to play with.   The controls can also be VERY overwealimg. every button on your keyboard and mouse has at least two functions.  The game has an â¥â¥â¥ load of mods and an â¥â¥â¥ load of RPG games. It is really a sandbox game when it comes to games revolving around RPG elements.   Now you may think I'm bashing the game, but I did say I recommend it! I do! It's a great game! SC is a lot of fun and it's very very intense. If you don't want this amount of realism, maybe try playing battlefield on origin, or even DOOM if you want an arena based shooter.  I give this game an 8.5/10  The only problems are the straight up noobs â¥â¥â¥â¥ing up the flow of the combat and the trolls â¥â¥â¥â¥ing up the flow of the combat. I recommend playing some scenario missions to get the controls and the feel down before jumping into multiplayer. People take this game pretty seriously...  -Edgar Allan Bro
2639	1	a	When I got this game I thought it wasnt going to be that great and figured it would be one of those games that I play if I can not think of anything else to play. But now, I am 700 hours in and I still play it almost every day. That being said, I highly recommend this game. There is a lot of different things you can do in it like, wasteland, roleplay stuff and many other game modes. There is also a lot of mods out there that make the game completley different and make it even more enjoyable. The game is very CPU intensive though so make sure you have a good cpu and a decent graphics card and the game will run fine, most of the time anyways.
3144	1	a	Love it. 10/10. Uses tons of cpu, wish it would use gpu more instead.
3846	1	a	i got this game on sale but i would of happly paid full price for it, amazing game so many different servers to play on. if your looking for a call of duty type of game this isnt it
1899	1	a	It was just a normal day in Invasion and Annex (A coop gamemode entirely community made that teams up the whole playerbase against AI, usually 50 as the player cap), I had taken Explosive Specialist and I was waiting at base to get teamed up with a squad. And holyâ¥â¥â¥â¥ I couldnt of gotten a better one.  First delpoyment was a cakewalk, so we decided to just get dropped off near the objective without ressuplying at base. 'We will take an airdrop' they said. So we half-resupplyed along the way. The next thing we know, we have been pinned down and holding our ground by literally all of the enemy forces in the point since the other squad wasnt doing a good enough job. Our medic got killed by a granade launcher, we ran out of first aid kits. So we threw some smoke and dragged the wounded away while me and our machinegunner covered, it was chaos. We held for about 20 minutes until â¥â¥â¥â¥ing base finally decided to send in medical evac. But not even that, instead of a chopper to get us out of that â¥â¥â¥â¥ing place, they sent another medic. At that point, I had ran out of ammo and was borrowing HE granades from the squad leader to use as mortars for targets that were 500 meters away.  Somehow we managed to push into the village, kill everything, and evac. I dont think a game has made me consistently feel knees deep in â¥â¥â¥â¥ for 2 hours or so. If you like to get shot down from the sky by AA guns and having really â¥â¥â¥â¥ing cool scenarios, get this game right now.   TL;DR enjoy being pinned down by troops for hours while you have no supplies and your allies back at base are circle jerking. Buy it. 
1219	1	a	Went onto a life community -&gt; Bought a car -&gt; Got arested for being black -&gt; Got out of prison -&gt; Died becouse of a 12 year old that couldnt drive   10/10 so realistic
4120	1	a	One of the most epic games ever made. If you want a true simulator of a soldier - ARMA III is the way to go! I recommend it to every hardcore player there!
2634	1	a	Best game ever.. hands down the most realistic first and third person shooter ive ever played, just get it.
1685	1	a	great game though i wish it felt more like arma 2 other than that its amazing may struggle on some setups
912	1	a	There is something simply exciting about Arma 3, and for me it is primarily driven by the moddibility of the game. From Vanilla to 20+ mods, every aspect is quite enteraining. Even after nearly 1000 hours of gameplay I continue to enjoy Arma with my friends in the Tac-Ops Gamming Community. Arma 3 is worth its prce serveral times over.
4720	1	a	Best Military Simulator Ever. 12/10
1750	1	a	Get the game, huge replay value multiple modes, and of course workshop items. It's basically infinitley replayable. The sandbox is really good, some mulitplaye servers are good. And some parts of the standard campagin are really intresting. But don't get it if you hate crashing alot, or unecissary loading screens. Or just the game turning your wifi into a potato in a toaster.
569	0	a	im sorry but this game is a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥, its terribly optimized and barely â¥â¥â¥â¥ing works. i played this on my travel rig (GTX 680 with a i7 4770k) and it could hardly get 30 fps on low in a city. This game feels unfinished and extremely unpolished.
849	1	a	[/h1]'One of the best Simulators in the world. By far the best Military Sim I have ever seen.'[/h1]  [/u][PROS]:[/u]  -You can run this on low settings preety well if you have a low-end system like me.  -If you have a beast system there are some mods to improve graphics (ENB's, Textures, etc.)  -The game is very lively. Lots of mods to fill in if you are bored.  -Eden editor will be coming soon so be hyped for that. (Not saying the normal editor is bad :P)  -The workshop has some awesome scenarios with a lot of detail (custom voices, custom guns &amp; vehicles, etc.)  -Campaign mod is decent, some missions may be hard and frustrating but all worth it in the end.  -Extensive amount of vanilla weaponry and vehicles.  -Oh how could I forget EXILE!! One of the funnest mods for ARMA 3!  [/u][CONS]:[/u]  -Price of $60.00 USD.   -Pray to god you have friends that play ARMA 3 because from what I know you won't make many friends.  -If you live in far away from Europe or America (such as Australia), A3Laucher will take a long time to download mods like AIA Terrain Pack, and other maps, forcing you to torrent or pray someone uploaded to MEGA or MediaFire.  -DLCs are too expensive and should be given out for free or for (I'll be nice) $5 each being it lacks content and does not stand for the 20$ each price tag.  Overall this game is freaking awesome, if you are bored, GET THIS GAME. You will not regret it!  -Shurik     Thanks for reading you sexy person! &lt;3      
2843	1	a	I liked the game but the fact that i payed for it a week ago and it when up for sale the next week is anoying
1382	1	a	cool 
1330	1	a	Sometimes It Wont UpDate My Game??
5150	1	a	It has very poor optimization and since the release of Apex a big chunk of the community has been placed behind a paywall. Despite this the campaign is very enjoyable and does a great job immersing you in the game. The multiplayer can be fun depending on the servers you join and having the Steam workshop available allows you to join any server with mods easily as long it is on the workshop.
593	0	a	This is perhaps the most overrated unoptimised peice of â¥â¥â¥â¥ game i have ever played it doesnt matter how good of a system you have you wont have a stable or good framerat
2182	1	a	Amazing game, You all need to pick this up if you like beautiful graphics and realistic combat. Harsh for any new player to master but when you get the the feel of the game and master the controls it's great fun, gets your heart pumping and adrenaline kickin.
1173	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ these rocks. Step on rock and died 66/6
4068	1	a	There's not much to say about Arma, so many crazy stories come out of it.  Once me and Two other friends were scouting around in some woods near some buildings, we were loaded up with weapons and some good backpacks. We spot a building we wanted to check for loot, except theres already about 3 or 4 guys in there from where we could see in the hills.  So my friends decide its not a good idea to go down there, I had a grenade on me, I took off my backpack and left my sniper in one place (So my friends could take it for me if I died), Took a grenade and a Pistol. I launched the grenade high into the air where it exploded confusing the enemy, I went Rambo into the building with a pistol and took all the guys out.  So Yeah.....10/10. GET THIS GAME!
3016	1	a	epic  realistic  and the altis and stratis is on greece  9/10
1431	1	a	I have owned this game for a long period of time (since alpha) but never played it that much seeming as I never played with anyone however this February 2014, I have had a blast playing with a few friends; demonofsparks and theavengedkoala. Wasteland is a fantastic game mode and I could not believe the time I was spending playing this. We all started playing at 10am and before we know it, it was 7pm. The time flew, especially when we are building/protecting our base, sneaking to the gun shop, stealing weapon caches, flying heli's and aircraft aswell as crashing into little stones on the road and your car completely blowing up. This truly is a very fun game - even if the price is steep. So buy this game and I will see you in the wasteland!
2957	1	a	I like the ability of custom gamemodes and mods.
2977	1	a	Bit Fkn Pricey M8
3499	1	a	Although I dislike Arma 3 as a game due to it's attitudes towards DLC as well as the futuristic setting, I can appreciate its capacity for milsim. The modding community makes up for it's shortcomings and results in a fantastic experience.
1921	1	a	Really,Really Good. I would highly recomend it to a new player or old player for PC! Definatley a game you need to buy!
412	1	a	Do you like running 5 km's only to be killed by some kid with a rocket launcher? I would suggest the game mode 'Wasteland.   Do you like being killed by your own team-mates decision to land in a open field? If so than go play ''king of the hill''.  Do you want to grind peaches for hours only to be killed by some random guy for no aparent reason ? Than you would probably enjoy the mode ''Life''.  Overall , this game yanks your â¥â¥â¥â¥ . Not to much as to where you get a friction burn ; but just enough to get you off (1-2 mins).  
2945	1	a	Arma 3 Is one of the best games I have ever played. No matter what you want to do on this game you can do it, and if someone hasn't created what you want to do you can make it yourself in this game. With the Eden Editior and the countless mods in the workshop the possibilities in this game are endless.  10/10
3548	1	a	it omg the bessssssssssssssssst game ever i love it i have met so meany nice peps on here 10/10
4149	1	a	 Tested the game during the free week-end on 2014.26.10   I have played Arma 2 and I am a fanatic of realistic military/tactical simulations, like the first Ghost Recons, Rainbox Six, America's Army, Insurgency, etc.  Note that right now I am at the  Tipping Point  mission, and I only played single player.  BTW I cannot finish the mission since I cannot for the life of me get into the speeboat. I can drown under it though. I also completed the entire tutorial which was very well made. +1 for this.  However the first impression of this game ain't good:  The 'simulation' part is very lacking .   Simulation? Nah... for real?
4496	1	a	Amazzzing game â¥â¥â¥â¥ing mate love this â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥ game great grafik and much more â¥â¥â¥â¥ LOVE IT
1497	1	a	I get to play it for three minutes before it crashes    10/10 IGN
4296	1	a	Arma 3 is fun if you have friends to play it with. plus thiers a wide vairity of mods such Breaking Point that can enhance your arma experiance. Buy it on sale and Have fun!
4142	1	a	If you want a really good war game and don't want autistic five year old yelling 'HARD SCOPER' or the game telling you 'You are leaving the Battlefield'
995	1	a	It's an awesome game! Lacks a few features though. So many mods which make the game more interesting. I recommend playing a COOP mission with your friends since this game does the job of making it as real as possible perfectly.
1152	1	a	Lots of missions, mods, and content. Much more, its Arma :P just beware your typical arma glitches but my favorite games to play. Too much for me to say why its good.
5065	1	a	You will never know a real game till you play this and learn to play it . 8/10 on game play 9/10 on gfx. love the game check it out.
2006	1	a	every single day i play this game and every single time a play it i get a boner and when i go to bed i sneak it in my room and play it but i get caught by my grandma and she says to me 'Listen you little â¥â¥â¥â¥ i told you to go to bed and â¥â¥â¥â¥ off' i cry evri teim and i wish i can fly away and play this every day and i watch gameplay and i masturbate
645	1	a	Great game for some tactical gaming.
3043	1	a	What can I say, Its one of the best games I've ever played!
71	1	a	I got PTSD from this game.         In the most immersive way possible.
5230	0	a	Good Game. Game Good. Price-Not good. Dont buy it yet.
2913	1	a	Best Milsim out there!   The only thing is optimization, this game needs it bad! its been out 2 years and its still not good. 8/10 I shouldnt be only getting 45-55 FPS on servers with a Gigabyte 980 Ti G1. I should be getting 70-90FPS if they fix that i would give it a 10/10. If they change the optimization they game would be amazing!
5152	0	a	Can't, just Can't  What can i say. Is it realistic?-yes! But with the laggy connections, question graphics, and did i mention the laggy connection??? gun fights at close range arent about anything other than whos got the better connection to the server.  Ive shot a guy 3 times at close range with a sniper rifle (point blank in chest). He killed me, I asked him how he was still standing, his responce? You shot me? ......   This is what you deal with, you can shoot people but do to horrible server connections the game simply becomes who can get a bigger gun.... Not what i paid for.
4249	1	a	Great game for hardcore gamers cant wait for what more is to come in this game
2392	1	a	Honestly this game touches me in places a woman never could.
703	1	a	Very Ploxy And MLG en mi opinion.
293	0	a	ArmA2 has much more content and is far more realistic (only medic can heal and it takes a while, weapons acting as real life counterparts, in ArmA3 everything is 'balanced' and you can self-heal in 3 seconds by clicking a proper button). ArmA2 has also more vehicles, more weapons, more everything... really, there is nothing to go for ArmA3 except a bit better graphic, but this is hardly anything important, especially because ArmA2 looks not much worse.   Moreover it's been over three months since the release date and the game still has unfinished campaign and terrible AI bugs. You don't have to take my word for it, watch a video:  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=178199064 
3463	1	a	Open world modable realistic fps/tps? who could say no?
914	1	a	Best Military sim out there. You can do anything and the community is great. Alot of addons to download, missions and people even make awsome gamemodes.
1623	1	a	Best Game EVER!!!  So many posibilitys (dont know how to write it) with moddet servers and the Editior. Only thing is that the campaign is bugged as hell and desyncs suck...
4889	1	a	As someone who plays Wasteland a lot. You either live long enough to be the person to kill fresh spawns, or you die quick enough to become the fresh spawn a lot.
4810	1	a	This is Petty much BF4 but more realistic.. Better Vehical machanics, Better Graphics, and Alot more recoil. I give this a solid 8/10
4374	1	a	Perfect game 5/7
311	1	a	*After two hours of benchmarking and testing my FPS i finally played it smoothly, so i decided to join a Co-op server.) :/ *I chose to be an auto-rifleman and grabbed an LMG, Big backpack and ammo, a few grenades too.* :D *I took a helicopter to a drop-point, to come under fire by the enemy!* :O *I quickly laid down and just began shooting, and after killing about two, i laughed evily over Direct Communications.* &gt;:3 *My friends died and i tried accessing their inventory, so i pressed G like in arma 2. I threw a grenade and died.* D: *I respawned and did the same mistake, just to get banned from the server.* :'c  10/10 would benchmark again.
3305	1	a	Arma 3 aims to be a realistic military/combat simulator, a goal that is well achieved, with very few drawbacks. I would definitely reccommend this game to anyone looking for a truly realistic First/Third Person Shooter or Military Simulation. If you're expecting this to be like Battlefield, you're wrong. If you expect this to be like Rainbow Six: Siege, you're wrong. If you ecpect this to be like CoD, why are you even here? I'd probably most closely compare this game to Squad, but with 2 maps that are much larger than any of those in Squad, and it's more complicated. There are several interesting game types in Arma 3, however most are simply overshadowed by the sheer mass of servers running Invade and Annex and Arma Life. Some things I would reccommend to newcomers are that you have a mic, and when joining a server online, you find out their Teamspeak or other 3rd party chat program server, because people will yell at (or kick) you for using global voice chat on most servers. I would also reccommend checking out some guides on youtube, as there is a very minimal tutorial system that could really use some work.  I would definitely give this game an 8/10  It successfully achieves its goals of an accurate military simulation, however the lack of a good tutorial and the fact that many excellent gamemodes are overshadowed by larger servers that only focus on 2 or 3 game types definitely takes away from the score.
3960	1	a	ArmA is one of the best games I have ever played, but be warned it is nothing like your mainstream shooter like Battlefield or Call of Duty. ArmA presents you with quite a challenge, because the AI is hard and unforgiving (sometimes even unfair) and weapons, vehicles and damage all feel quite realistic.  I recommend getting the DLC Pack with it and (as soon as it releases) getting the expansion. The DLCs bring cool new content to the game and it is a great way to additionally support the Developers  ArmA can also be greaty improved with mods, to anyone new to the game: Check out mods like TFAR, ACE3, ASR AI and RHS:Escalation
1638	1	a	Great game!
1310	1	a	Before playing this game you should ask yourself - what military operation would you like to play? Do you want to be a sniper? Do you want to be a part in a big combined arms operations? Do you want to ride a tank? Helicopter? Kart? Do you want to be a civilian and simply role-play your wild dreams? Do you want to play as a god? Really, there is not much to be said about ARMA that has not been said - yes, there are bugs, yes it is still a bit laggy, but it gets better. And it will get better because developers still update game and listen to fans feedback. You can have hundreds of mods, do whatever you want to do or simply follow missions. It is all up to you. This is main difference between other military shooters - it is a sandbox concept, which means you are buying lot of games in one.
3162	1	a	10/10 Beautiful game. I could get lost for hours.
4039	1	a	Best military simulator ever... Want to experience some hardcore â¥â¥â¥â¥ not COD â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t? try it, buy it, enjoy it.
2924	1	a	This game is really fun with alta life and wasteland plus breaking point makes it worth it alone.. plus i got it when it was on sale for $35 ^_^
4276	1	a	Best game NA why you no buy you scrubarino? :D
2178	1	a	I've Played this game since December 2013, and if i look back and see how the game was at that time and how it's now i feel like the game has improved so much! But it's still some things that needs fixing. If you are into Military Simulation, PVP, Roleplay etc. this game is for you! But Arma III is a game where you can make everything possible! For Example Aftermath Rush - Battlefield in Arma III, And as i've said i have played this from December 2013 and i DO NOT regret buying arma at all! I've gotten so much out of this game and YES this game is worth the price and MORE!
98	1	a	i havent played this game alot but i can tell you that this game is  10% skill 40% walking 15% fps (get it) 15% dying 29.99999% wondering what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ is shooting at you .00001% putting a 9 year old in front of a firing squad  10/10 would firing squad a 9 year old again
5270	1	a	i dont even own this game.
3466	1	a	Really fun fps. Enjoy it much more than Arma 2. The DayZ mod here isnt that great, but you gotta make do with what you got.
2117	1	a	If you like randomly exploding vehicles this is a game for you
37	1	a	I'm pretty sure I have played more then 2000+ on the disc version so trust me, its definitly worth the price ^^
3749	1	a	It's ok i guess.
1717	1	a	Pff where should I start. Let's start out with the fact that I'm only three hours away from having 600 hours in this game. Umm.. yeah, I can really recommend this game to everyone who is looking for a realistic (no, let's not say realistic, instead simulating reamlisme) This game is trying really hard to simulate realisme, which to be fair it does pretty decent aswell.. Of course you can never really make a game that is totally realistic, but this does the job for me at least. I'd say the campaign is decent, way better than the games before it though. I play mainly altis life, where I meet lots of friends and people who stole my kidney. There is not that many TDM servers though, mostly german ones. But plenty of CooP servers (I recommend '=7Cav=' Coop server) Umm yeah, the inventory-UI is wastly improved and is a lot more easy to use. Also there is a ton of new 'combat stances' which can come in handy if the fence you are hiding behind is to low to prone or too tall to crouch behind. The AI... is um really like it's always been stupid and careless but once they spot you from like over 1000m they are able to hit you like it was nothing, that can be a bit a pain in the â¥â¥â¥ sometimes, but hey.. Don't get this game for singleplayer experience go buy this game, go to multiplayer and search for some 'Altis life' 'Wasteland' servers. Hey did you know 'Altis' is an actually Greek island called 'Limnos/Lemnos'
3942	1	a	Game = Mods  Great game! Constant hours played on 'Altis Life' and 'A3L'. The fact is this game is pretty boring without the mods added into it, most will agree with me! I think the highlight of what made Arma 3 a popular game was the Altis Life Mod which made a fun environment where communities could form and do RP within the game, that mod is recommened. However despite having nearly 150hours just on Altis Life, a new mod 'A3L' i has sparked up and taken over in opinion. The mod is a other RP mod like Altis Life however more shops, a new map [Lakeside] and is taken more serious but is more fun to be fair. From robbing banks to being in a high speed chase as a cop, you can do it all for yourself here. Arma 3 is the game for you to get into the modded games community for sure, you may even make your own community out of it [own a server]. Note this game also has improved graphics from arma 2 and really is smooth when playing [NO MORE DESYNC].  Ratings below:  Arma 3 [No Mods]: 5/10 Arma 3 [Mods]: 10/10  Thanks
2211	1	a	It's cool beans
237	1	a	Very good game won't regret buying it. So many good mods, currently most time played on this game out of all my steam games.
2587	1	a	Highly suggest getting this game. I found it highly addictive, and love making new missions. Also if you dont have a decent PC dont bother, Arma 3 is best at its full quality and i couldn't stand playing it when my old computer couldn't handle it.
2118	1	a	Honestly hands down the best realistic FPS ever. The authenticity just by itself is worth the price. But the multiplayer is phenomenal and very tactical and fun. Highly recommend this game, but there is one thing. THIS GAME NEEDS TO BE OPTIMIZED! I have GTX titan and I still get from anywhere 20~65 fps which is unacceptable, like really 20 f**king fps? But other than that super fun.
1151	1	a	very nice game lots of weapons maps based in greek islands but if you dont have a friend to play with dont buy it and also very nice edditor mode where you can make yor own missions

1950	1	a	Arma 3 is the true sequel to the beloved Operation Flashpoint (Or as itâs known on steam as Arma: Cold War Assault.)   I say that, because as an old school flashpoint âget of my lawnâ guy, Arma 3 is the first truly unique version of the Flashpoint formula that just feels right. OFP is one the best games of all time, nobody forgets being abandoned on Everon, with nothing but your M16 and hundreds of Soviets between you and the evac ship. Or as Victor Troska leading the Resistance and throwing that T55 between buildings just so that Hind canât snipe you with a rocket. And all of the mods, all of them. (Hereâs looking at you FFUR, ECP, FDF, BW) But, alas back to the task at hand. Eventually the first Arma came out.    Arma was fun mostly because it was like OFP with new graphics which was nice for a while, but something about it just wasnât that enthralling, it felt like the game was shooting for the extra point and missed. Not very far off, but enough to just feel a little to hollow. I also have fond memories of the campaign breaking on multiple occasions, the gigantic lag spikes in MP, and the absolutely hilarious voiceovers. â2 FALL BACK INTO FOORMATIOOOON.â Oh and that disappointing AI pathfinding, I remember screaming 'Just go into the damn house!' When I was using the editor, but Sergai felt like he should just hang outside of the doorway then awkwardly crane his neck at the oncoming enemy. Then to rub salt on the wound, do the classic snail sidestep turn slightly right until he got drilled in the head by an M4 round. It was like OFP 1 1/3.    Arma 2 came along as the unoptimized buggy mess it was, and I couldnât really get into it. The fact that when you loaded the coop campaign and you couldnât even get out the ship doors to start it, was not the best first impression. But it did have the funniest\saddest line Iâve ever heard uttered from a voice actor. âSTAND DOWN SOLDIER, STAND THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ DOWN.â And letâs not forget âSPREAD WIDER THEN A THAI HOOKERS THIGHS, HOORAA.â In that high pitch squeaky voice. So thank you Arma 2 for that. There were some parts of it though, that were getting better. And, I believe the mod support was what saved it. And there was Sergai again, back for round two. All I wanted him to do was to go in that damn house, just once to go into the house. 'YOU CAN DO IT SERGAI!' I exclaimed as the M4 round sailed into his head again while he was doing the crane head sidestep dance. It was like OFP 1 2/3rdsâ¦    Finally, as they say, 3rd times a charm - Arma 3 came along and I fell in love all over again, a game better than the sum of its parts, a game with actual voice acting, the fact that it actually takes itself seriously, decent writing, a completely revamped physics engine, a game that is polished and clean, just like the original. The units and story are cool and inventive. I love the campaign and all the new mission editor tools, like virtual arsenal. The flashpoint formula finally stepped into the next century with this game. I recommend it whole heartedly, even as the bitter old war veteran who was playing FDF coop campaign with friends in Europe back in 2005. Not to mention the community and mod support tools are amazing, and in full swing. Not only that, but the game is updated all the time and now, for the first time ever we even have a 3D Editor! How neat is that? Sergai will now not only go into the house, but he can patrol it, check around cover, AND HE DOESN'T SIDESTEP SNAIL TURN ANYMORE, this time he can finally get the drop on that enemy, the world is your's Sergai. Thank you Bohemia for bringing flashpoint back.
4459	1	a	I play ArmA 3 since Alpha, it has changed alot since first builds all in plus. Its currently best game to buy if you think about Tactical FPS game, and also it isnt just that you buy ArmA and its all you get. ArmA 3 like ArmA 2 is a platform that allows modders to create completly different game modes that developers originally designed, also the game has a lot of devs attention. DLC-s like ZEUS make this game even more interesting and avilible even for non scripting gamer society. Only thing i wish to see in future ArmA 3 development is more DLC (no matter if free or not if it bring lots of new stuff) and Directx12 witch will help to improve performance.
503	1	a	Best military simulator ever.  After 2 years: Bugs, bugs, bugs.
5180	0	a	Terrible game Purchased the game on my new comp loggen in said i was Global Ban or something tried contacting steam and bhio'ARMA 3'
1701	1	a	Only game where the lag kills you 10/10.
371	1	a	Simply put, no other game compares to Arma 3. The best combat simulator on the market, nothing comes close to delivering what Arma does. TL;DR PROS/CONS at the bottom!  Literally, no other game is as much of a sandbox as Arma 3. With oodles of content already baked into the game, there's thousands of hours literally to explore just of the vanilla content! Then, pile on the massive and hugely supportive mod community.. And you have the recipe for a game that keeps on giving.   Once you find an appropriate multiplayer circle that suits you and you feel at home, and are experiencing content YOU want to see in your gaming experience, you will get lost in the hours spent. The community of Arma is one of the most diverse and enduring in all of gaming, and is a special spot in PC gaming as a whole.   There's loads of singleplayer content in there too, the campaign is fully voice acted and is a great showcase of what the engine can do.  All the awesome to be spoken of, it does have it's few shortcomings, like most titles. The first one would be the tremendous real world PC requirements, yes you will need a higher end machine to have a truly enjoyable time in this title, to get any decent FPS. This game is a CPU hog, expect your CPU to turn into your room heater during long sessions. It is prone to many very annoying (and sometimes gamebreaking) bugs, that will break your experience if you let it get to you. Finding your community niche can be hard if you don't know what to search for.  All the cons being said though... They all have ways you can get around them as a personal player.   The problems relating to your computer, have an intel i5 or equivelent and a 2GB GPU, and you're in a pretty good start zone for getting acceptable FPS for an okay experience.  Think exponentially for a better experience in the CPU, Arma 3 MAY benefit from more VRAM in the future, but for now is limited to 2GB VRAM, hard-coded into the engine. The game is still 32-bit, so does not use more then 3GB of RAM anywho, though faster RAM will always result in better load times.  As for the bugs and glitches you (can) encounter with this game... Very rarely does it crash, only under the most intense conditions should you ever see this come close to happening, the worst case scenario I have personally experienced was just extremely poor FPS under insane conditions, that equated to my game essentially locking up. But... That's not really the issues you'll be concerned about. There are several nuances to several systems within the game that like to just bug. The network is very easy to desync, and this causes all kinds of zany bugs. As an experienced player, I learn to troubleshoot these issues quickly as a part of the experience, and to be sure to always laugh at it. Remember, it's a game. Again, these issues are not specifically game breaking, but can be experience breaking.  I really do love this game. I look forward to the DirectX12 update coming with the new Tanoa terrain map. Hopefully we get a smoother ride with DirectX12, but for now this is an endearing experience if you are willing to engage yourself as a player. The gaming experiences you have in this sandbox are unrivaled, no other gaming experience will compare. If you have a love for true gaming, this game belongs in your library in my opinion. This is Game Of The Century for me, despite it's shortcomings, the experience is unlike any other.   TL;DR PROS/CONS LIST: Basically.. It's like a girlfriend. You're going to love it, you're going to hate it at times, but you know there's a reason you put up with the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t... Because there's nothing else like it that compares.  PROS: -Amazing endless sandbox experience that is customizable to your liking. -Beautiful graphics and entertaining physics really brings together an immersive experience. -Best combat simulator on the market hands down, experience unlike any other. -Endearing and loving community really makes the game feel complete.  CONS: -Experience breaking and sometimes game breaking bugs can be annoying if you don't know how to deal with it. -Requires a higher end PC to run acceptably, I really can't reccomend this game for low end PC users. -Sometimes some of the community can be little nutsacks.
1925	1	a	I don't even know where to start. This is the #1 military simulator in the world. I loved BF and AA but omg this is something that no game can compete with. The reality factor is unbelievable (yes yes some things still need work, like tire explosions and some vehicle control but it's the best it gets so far). All the aspects they need to improve aren't a big deal because they have a huge and amazing developer's team which keeps releasing amazing updates and HUGE DLC's and bunch of extra content.   Honestly, you don't need to read any review unless you're looking for very specific detail. Watch their promo video heree and go on their forums to learn the most. You don't need to read a lengthy review to know this is one of the best games ever made. GET IT GET IT GET IT. Do NOT wait for it to drop in price (it does here and there) Just get the Digital Deluxe Edition and all of the DLC's. You spend 50-60 bucks on games which you beat in under 100 hours or even under 20 hours. You'll spend $100-$200 on ArmA3 but expect HUNDREDS and THOUSANDS of game time. There is ALWAYS something new to do. TONS of game types and OMG if you play with a friend or let alone a LAN party, that's the best it gets, it's so much fun. An amazing community consisted of military enthusiasts and active soldiers and veterans as well as Emergency Response personnel like Fire Fighters, Police Officers and Paramedics. Why does it matter? Becaause these men and women know how to takeand give orders. How to make a simulator like ArmA feel as if you're actually in there. Just do yourselves a favor. Stop saving for whatever you're saving, stop reading this and go buy the game. Then start saving again :)   My Rating: 9.5/10 I know it's tough to make everything perfect but things like vehicle and aircraft control need to feel a bit more real (most of them do but some are just so frustrating) also little things like when your tire blows up, it shouldn't just disappear lol... That's why you didn't get a full 10/10. Those small things, really do matter. Some people will hate on me for saying that but I am sorry, many would agree with me. I couldn't give it less than 9.5/10 because even though they still need some work on some objects in the game, it's the best I have ever seen, ever. Nothing get's this real and collaborative. The team play in this game is unbelievably crucial for success. Most of the time it's plain suicide to go solo. This is as real as it gets (behind a computer monitor). Have fun. Make ArmA, Not War.     Bottom Line: Kids play Battlefield, Boys play America's Army, Men play ArmA.   
786	1	a	good game fun to play whit friends
1104	1	a	dis gam is vri gr8 i r8 9/10 ign not as good as a2 HAIL MASTER GOAT
2054	1	a	Kids play COD. Boys play Battlefield. Men play Arma
888	1	a	I love this game so mutch why? you can play on a open sandbox map, there are like tons of mods out for Arma 3, Co-op missions, Deathmatches, RolePlay-Life mods, it has everything for everyone, actually too mutch to mention i just love it!! 
2301	1	a	HELL FREAKIN YEA! Buy this, this just shows the power of the PCMASTERRACE! Best exclusive ever, i reccomend this series more than any other game, everyone needs the chance to play this game. I reccomend it more than any other game ive ever played, most amazing thing that ever happend to me. BUY IT!
160	1	a	The game it's self is awesome, especially since I've upgraded my machine.  You really need a good CPU it'll make the difference!  A couple of bad points to it thought.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCKGWReDeQ8  Admin abuse.... Honestly this was my first experience of 'Online' play.  Also you'll notice the water marks. I was spawned in with gear that I shouldn't of been able to wear. So I'm punished by being spammed with Water marks of icons that fit the mod in order to buy that DLC.   I wouldn't of cared if it didn't effect the entire game.   Edit:  Admin being a prick.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZTjb56MLgU  Admin cheating  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaO3-R2a9sk 
3638	1	a	love this game so much
2907	1	a	Well Built Game Worth The Buy. Hours Of Fun
5217	1	a	Awesome Game! You should Buy this game if your pc can run it otherwise you will get 20- Fps and thats not playable.
4140	1	a	This game got me pregnant
1303	1	a	Its a good game.
754	1	a	Good â¥â¥â¥â¥, better than Arma 2, but not enough weapons or vehicles.
3218	1	a	Completely realistic and fun. Needs more weapons but the realism is unbelievable. Worth the money, really laggy (if you have a bad computer) but once you 'tweak' the game, it will make the game less laggy. Another thing is that the buildings are so high quality that when you go near them, you lag. Even when you are near hangars!
3248	1	a	Arma 3 is a great improvement over Arma 2 and OA this doesnt have M4A1's or M16's but does have the FNX45, Masada, and others the vehicles are more futuristic so no ABRAMS or Blackhawks but all of this is fine because you can download mods or get All in Arma to get ported content from the previous Arma games. Over all I think you should get this game and as it says it brings you to WAR!
3232	1	a	Not anyting like the FPS your use to. Its much better! If you are looking for a fast paste fps this is not for you! Requires a bit of your pc, but some commands can help run it a bit better!
2908	1	a	I love to allah akbar in t4 with my mohawk on KoTH
4371	1	a	Let's see where I can go with this review.  My overall rating: 8.0  Individual ratings:  Gameplay: 7.0 Graphics: 9.5 Single player: 7.0 Multiplayer: 8.5  Okay, so let's start with gameplay.  The gameplay of this game is great. Although the game could use more vehicles, the game itself feels modern, realistic and immersive. You can have a handful of scenarios to test your skills in, or you can jump into user made missions. Both which do the job well. Although the former is limited, the latter is not and there can be a large number of missions available on the workshop for you to enjoy.  The weapons and vehicles feel great to handle when using peripherals such as wheels or flight sticks, and the HUD is easy on the eyes. It looks very neat, so information is organized nicely. You can adjust this to your liking too. No HUD? No problem.  'So, why did you rate this 7.0 if you liked it so much?'  One thing spoils this game - frame rate issues. No matter how I play the game, the frame rate drops frequently and can be very annoying. I've tried everything to get it to work, but nothing changes. Once this is fixed, this will jump up to 8.5. Only other suggestions are minor improvements such as a larger variety of controls for vehicles and fixing the free camera.  Graphics are next and when I maxed out the settings, the game looked beautiful. The models were smooth, the textures were sharp. There wasn't many graphics glitches and you could control the graphics in a variety of ways. I like this a lot. I think the planes should have a larger variety of camouflages, but that's about it. I already mentioned how the HUD looks clean, so I won't mention that again. The environmental effects look nice too, such as rain and night. This is my favourite part about Arma games; although the gameplay is nice, the graphics draw me in more. It's a cool touch.  Single player: A lot of workshop mods as well as a good variety of base missions. Nothing to dislike. However, campaigns shouldn't be dependant on DLC. I don't know about you, but I think the Apex DLC is overpriced. That's my opinion though. VR, or Virtual Reality (a mode in Arma where you can test out weapons and vehicles) is cool too, good for comparing weapons.  Multiplayer: if you don't find yourself in a game full of trolls and team killers, the game can be very co operative. Domination servers are my favourite because it's good to have to adapt to different scenarios. For example, taking out AA, CAS comes in, enemy reinforcements come in so you need to hit a radio tower to stop reinforcements. Things like that. Great with friends too. However, I've had some bad experiences with some ARMA admins (I got banned permanently because I was apparently cheating, all I did was run from a truck to the BLUFOR base) but this shouldn't put you off the other servers where admins are decent.
1657	1	a	Epic game only just started playing but feel like it will just get better
5008	1	a	Feddback: +lots of mods +great maps +nice sp (never thought) -the egine makes problems  9/10 SP 10/10 MP    
4992	0	a	Not worth 60$
4327	1	a	Seems good so far.  jk, best game ever. Defenetly worth buying. 11/10!
1188	1	a	All the hours speak for itself.
4310	1	a	This game is sick
430	1	a	Best game ever, enough said.
2593	1	a	Its a great game, buy it
2205	1	a	Really fun and cool so buy it with all $90 that its worth
2401	1	a	This game is the most amazing game I have ever played! I do not usually post reviews, and if I do they are usually for negative feedback but arma deserves any and all posative feed back.
4589	1	a	Best of its kind ot their. However you need to be a patient learner as their is a steep learning curve and i would recomend finding a group or friends to teach you
983	1	a	I recommend this game , the graphics are amazing , it has easy to learn controls and the maps are huge
2891	1	a	Its a great game and im always excited to start up an operation, especially with the Milsim unit im in. We typically use mods and non base game maps and items to further add to the experience, although we have a base arma public server its always funt o play either, communities can be great in this game and although it isnt the best optimized it isnt too much of a problem to everyone. IFf your interested in our Milsim, its call Task Force Spartan. We have a TS and a website, the links:  http://taskforcespartanrealism.shivtr.com/  If your interested join the website make an Application and we will definetly explain anything you want to know after. In any case id recommend this game and many communities to anyone who enjoys some good teamwork and a bit of milsim in their lives.
1740	1	a	A great game, It's realistic and expansive, with a wide range of thins to play, from Altis life to MilSim to Exile, Arma 3 has a gamemode for any Fps fan.  Side note- I play Arma 3 on a laptop so you don't need a beastly PC to run it.
3221	1	a	i dont even have this game lol
2678	1	a	8.66666666/10, cause my well trained sniper can't hold his breath.
4087	1	a	Ive spent way too long playing this game, but i can say its the best game ive played. Playing this game has made 95% of my steam friends and that may be from mil-sim servers to life servers and survival servers. This game always has something for you to do. I 100% recomend it and also the DLC's as they just make the game even more fun! so see you in game!
3005	1	a	Although I like Chernarus much more than Altis and Stratis, the game itself is highly improved over ARMA 2, physics being the first thing, but not limited to it..  Movement is much more natural, and so are voices..  Would I recommend it? yes..  But it lacks the love I used to feel for Chernarus itself, the landscapes and environment in general
979	1	a	I really like the game. It is really fun and almost all the way realistic. Just sometimes when you fall like 5-10 feet you die. Which is ridiculous iand stupid. I would rate this game a 8/10.
4207	0	a	Part of the appeal of this game is the realism (i.e. ballistics, stamina, environment), which positive reviewers rave about. The realism makes this the most exciting and action-packed pc game I've ever played. The majority of the game is sprinting for five seconds to a badly rendered bush or maybe a tree with three sides, then having to pause for 30 seconds so that your aim will calm itself. How did the game know I have Parkinson's? You'll unload three clips trying to shoot one contact 100 yards away in an open field, and feel ecstatic after staring and shooting at one another for a good minute. It's almost like playing tag with good friends, except for the part where someone gets tagged. I did enjoy the sounds of bullets whizzing by, and I'm sure the AI experienced the same bliss since we did nothing but lie on the ground and fire seemingly randomly at one another. Ironically, when well- hidden behind a tree or rock (or other random cover) and peek around the corner, the AI suddenly becomes an expert marksman and kills you with one shot. That'll teach me for trying to be tactical.  Save points are set within the game, and waypoints are even more predictable, leading to non-frustrating replays and non-existent monotony. There's no real way to be stealthy or use environmental advantages because the AI has Xray and auto-aim, so that's a relief. Your squad will most likely make all the kills, and leave you in the dust since stamina does not affect them the way it affects you. Also, certain characters have infinite health so there's no real urgency in helping with firefights. Time to kick back and let everyone else have fun.  Then there's the weird controls, which will have you rolling on the floor (literally) out of cover right into incoming fire. That's the last thing the enemy expects! You'll try to scavenge weapons and ammo from fallen soldiers, only to be shot dead while trying to navigate the extremely simple and intuitive equipment interface. I guess that's my fault for not being able to perform 400 actions per minute. As a plus, you can steal clothing and make yourself wear glasses or bandanas which have no real tactical advantage besides trolling a fallen soldier.   I forgot to mention that you'll bleed out and die if you don't bandage your arm with a first aid kit after being shot anywhere on your body. That's actually pretty realistic, since it's a medical fact that your arm is the hub of all your blood circulation and health. As you're wounded, aim and mobility decrease to the point that's so real you won't be able to contribute in any positive way, except to be cannon fodder for the enemy. It's ok though, when you die you'll get to respawn with full health. But then when you restart the checkpoint, you can't fire your gun because there's apparently a glitch in programming (or is it?) which doesn't allow reloading. This is great, since the game already saved your progress and you're stuck with one bullet you can't fire anyways. The realism is scary.   I would not recommend this game for $60, or even on sale for $30. I would wait till the price increases to at least $99.99, so that way you'll maximize your regret for spending so much money on a game that's so realistic, you could go outside with an airsoft gun and have the exact same experience. Just make sure you're terrible at everything and the illusion will be complete. Sorry, not illusion; simulation.
2668	1	a	I love Arma 3. Not only the game but the vast communities for this game. modded or not the game is fun and challenging.
1919	1	a	Die for falling 3M 10/10 would play agian IGN
1205	1	a	i think i need a few more hours to write a good review for this game
2003	1	a	realistic army simulator, with modern weapons, wehicles and terrains, which are the size of a small contries. The game has a huge learning curve for an FPS shooter, has Map editor to make a war scenarios on your own for MP as SP, and huge mod support for all sort of content, where game shines the most
3045	1	a	Sure you need a budget the size of the US military's anual spending for your pc to be able to play this game, but boy is it worth it.
468	1	a	A game that has no equal, there really is nothing quite like arma.
175	0	a	Dear Bohemia,  Instead of releasing more islands and single player garbage no one cares about, how about you guys do something about the game's atrociously bad framerate?   This game is very heavily CPU dependent (doesn't really tax your graphics card at all) and yet I still get lousy framerates with an overclocked i7.
5252	0	a	'failed to start' (no license)  really??? I have 10 hours left to play this game for a test run, and cant play it?!?!?
817	1	a	Arma 3 is a great game with a large map and tons of things to do. There are many vehicles and weapons to chose from to destroy your enemy, or random helpless rabbits. There are plenty of mods to keep you satisfied. You can also create your own battles. I would recommend this game to anyone who does not need constant action to have fun.  8/10  Positives +Vehicles +Weapons +Large map +Customization +Mod Support +Freedom  Negatives -A little rough on the FPS -The controls are hard to get used to
2643	1	a	This game is amazing, now im kinda late to the reveiw cause I have almost 2k hours but the game is really good and the modder community makes it even better
3850	1	a	Amazing but not a good variety of vehicles. It will deserve the wait though. Love the soundtrack.
880	1	a	A big open wonderful military sandbox that is made even better by its active and passionate modding community.
4760	1	a	Let me tell ya sth bout this gaem... 1) ITS 10/10 for noscoping noobs that think that bcz they are good at BF and COD they are good at any game. 2) 15fps on LOW in a City still worth, not playable but WORTH 3) graphics, meh...id go for full high no matter whats your PC your so or so not gonna have good fps even on low so why watch sh*t when you can watch the 10/10 graphics 4) engine, meh you cant jump... still 10/10  10/10 would play again if it wasnt for desync and my sh*t net
4536	1	a	It has to be one of the best games i've played, and i have played almost every single console and pc game out there. just literally everything about the game is incredible. the realism, the gameplay, just its a truly amazing game i paid $59.99, im fine with that price for future expansion of the game... constantly updating the game. i currently play Arma 3 Epoch, and i really enjoy the mod, most of my hours are from the mod and i havent even tried the other mods yet. highly recommend the game to anyone unless your a call of duty fan boy or your a young kid. As soon as the marksman dlc comes out, of course i will be getting that. so if your on the fence with this game DONT even think about NOT getting it. The one and only one con to this game is gonna have to be the opimization. If you DONT have a intel chipset its gonna be very hard to run this game, i currently am using a AMD 8350 and i only get 30-low 40 fps in multiplayer server Standard settings with a GTX 960, so with me loving this game soo much i am currently saving a little money to purchase a Intel I5 4690k so i can run this game at ease with my card. So if you have a intel chipset and a decent graphics card, you should be fine with this game, and I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend gettng it, if you dont like the vanilla game, the mods make it 200% better. Men Do Real Life Young Men Play Arma Boys Play Battlefield Kids Play Call Of Duty
2885	1	a	its real good, buy now

4342	1	a	Great game.
4625	1	a	Do you like to spend 30 minutes waiting to get deployed, only to have your helicopter shot down by an enemy jet? How about spending 20 minutes to get the the AO only to realize that your team has already captured it? Do you want to know the feeling of waiting for hours to get into combar, just like real life? If you want real military simulation (including the time it takes to get into combat) then this game is for you.
2656	1	a	Ä°t's a good RPG game.
4390	0	a	runs as well as a dead kid in a wheelchair
2810	1	a	most realistic shooter out there. will take a bit of getting used to, but its worth it!
2685	1	a	good â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥tttt
4195	0	a	I have only played this a half hour, but that half hour it has been horrible. It's nothing like a good shooter, in my opinion. I expected this to be like ... better.  This game really had alot of potential to me, and i do not recommend it at all. I simply hate this game.  Pros : - Good Graphics - Refunding  Cons : - You can get kicked for no reason - Bad AI - Nearly every server is Epoch (dayz) - Every other server is some weird mods as well  Please do not hate me, i just saw so much potential in this game. I'm sad they made this game like it is.
399	1	a	Bean Bag Buccaneers is a two player children's game, the object of which is to pick up your treasure chest on the central island and sail back safely.  Each player has a giant sailing ship as their main game piece. Each ship has a removable sail, two trigger-action side panels, and a huge spring-driven cannon. Players take turns moving forward along a prescribed track and shooting bean bags at their opponent's ship. A hit on one of the side panels will force it to pop off and give the player a free shot at the other side; a hit forcing the sail off becalms the ship for a turn.  To add to the pirate flavor, each player also has an eye patch. Wearing these will slightly affect depth perception and add a marginal bit of sport to the shooting.  This game retailed for the somewhat impressive sum of $16 back in 1962. With its huge plastic ships (close to a foot long), giant vinyl play mat, and the eye patches, it may well stand as one of the more overproduced games of the early 1960s. Bean Bag Buccaneers.  10/10 goty
5042	1	a	I pretty much only got this game to play Altis Life, which is a server mod for Arma III Multiplayer.  I tried out the single player mode, and as an ex-army man myself, I found the gameplay to be too over-realistic and died too many times. I'm sure if I had my peripheral vision and my best mates beside me, like I did in real life, then I'd survive a lot further in single player mode.  Altis Life on the other hand... I was a mad gansta motherf*cker!
2156	1	a	1131 Hours in a Video Game!? Seriously!? Where's me Official Urban City Map!?  Well...until then...guess another 1131 Hours to go!
4141	1	a	This game has no good servers do not buy this game unless you want to wait for the one good server to open.
1166	1	a	If you're looking for true military combat, with realism in every detail, then this game is for you. Arma 3 at its core is a true military simulation sandbox game. It is the Minecraft of military shooters. Arma allows you to engage in combat at all levels, from ground infantry, to dogfights, to vehicle combat, heck, you can even fight underwater.   If it's possible in real life, it's most likely possible in Arma. If not, there are plenty of mods made by the healthy, active community which can help make your dreams come true. Arma has been known for its modability. DayZ? Yea that was an Arma 2 mod before it was a standalone game. For some, Arma, as a great game alone, is simply a baseplate for you to make whatever you want. There are no limits.   The vast land of Altis (~270 square km) is all playable. There is no 'backdrop' like Call of Duty or Battlefield. There is no one stopping you from playing on top of that awesome looking hill or in that large town. Too big for you? Stratis is only 20 square km. Still too big? Well there's never an issue with going smaller with the great map tools like the editor and Zeus.   The options are limitless. No levels, no unlocks, no pay to win, no stupid DLC so you can have forests or Close Quarters Combat specific maps. Arma 3 is here so you can experience war the way YOU want to. No matter what your interest is, there's sure to be a server or group out there for you. There is no feeling similar to accomplishing a mission that was made and played by real people. No AI, no scripted events, all people. It feels like you just came out of a badass movie battle, because that's pretty much what it just was. That's what this game is about. You want to do it? Go right on ahead. As the saying goes,  make Arma, not war.   Now this review didn't cover everything, and by no means is this game flawless, but it is a game that has kept me interested for quite some time. As such, I will try my best to make a cons vs pros list (cons first because there aren't as much).    CONS
2315	1	a	Very good game, I would highly recommend this to anyone that likes a semi-realistic war sim. This game struggles heavly from optimization issues. I have an i5 3570K at 4.4 GHz and a GTX 760. At best this game will use 60% of my CPU and or GFX card and only getting 25-40 FPS at 1920x1080 in a busy server. In single player I can get up to 80-90 FPS. Changing my GFX settings really wont change my FPS more than about 10%. 9/10
1491	1	a	One of the best Mil-Sim games out there! You like shooting, flying, driving, blowing stuff up or just taking in the scenery; this game is sure to suprise. Plus there are several great mods and missions to explore.
296	1	a	Arma 3 Is a  Amazing Game . Its makes you really think when you are in gunfight, but sadly it has a huge learning curve. This game isn't for someone who doesn't want to feel their heart beating quicker than they have ever felt it, but it is for the adrenaline junkie. Mods/Workshop items for this game greatly improve it, and without a shadow of a doubt, i would reccomend this game to ANYBODY who loves tactical/realistic shooters.
729	1	a	This ain't CoD
3895	1	a	amazing graphics, though not compared to Crysis 2 or 3, but still very good considering what you get. this is not your average FPS game, this has a ton of features, meaning no matter what happens, this will likely remain a pc exclusive, as a controller simply don't have enough buttons for all the functions. it has a good single player campaign, and a very active online scene. it is a rather demanding game for any system, but i suspect this is due to the engine, and the fact it has to do so much at once.
2409	1	a	awesome sim. many servers are still under development but it feels very real to play the game.
3754	1	a	Played a little, has some replayability.
3618	1	a	Default (vanilla) ARMA 3 - 8/10, very solid game.  ARMA 3 with mods - 100500/10. Absolute must have.
3322	1	a	Love The Game It's The Ultimate Tactical Shooter.I Reccomend to buy deluxe
2064	1	a	very low settings : 15 fps ultra settings : 14 fps  100/10 would fps again
5041	1	a	When i die i feel like rubbing sand paper in and out my â¥â¥â¥.....10/10 for the pain
895	1	a	This game is a simulator not just a traditional shooter,The full experience of the game Lies in its multiplayer that although does have many game types and modes to choose from,nothing beats 'Tactical Realism' based modes . Thats where the game shines, where team work is required every step of the way to complete a common goal. There are clans that host Organized combat events, where you get the full deal with ranks and comanders feeding down orders through the chain of command, I've played with a few of these realism clans like the 7Cav, 77Jaysowk and i've even played in one of the public events of the 'SOF' Clan and plenty more i cant seem to remember off the top of my head, the arma 3 Community in general is a very warm and welcoming one as i saw during my participation with the people in these clan communites.   No doubt this game isnt for the Average joe, its not about score and killstreaks and action around every corner,  its a simulator and its all about Tactics,Patience,skill and above all Teamwork  P.S. if you're new to this game you'll probably need a program called 'TeamSpeak 3' for multiplayer, its like a virtual radio and we use it for the majority of multiplayer communication
3714	1	a	Arma 3 is a love hate relationship. Once you figure out the basic controls for each type of system its a blast. The most recent DLC APEX is amazing and just feels really refined. If you dont like twitch shooters and you like to think about your move before you make it. This is the game for you!
2899	1	a	i don't even have this game but i still can review it uhhhhhh
2500	1	a	Probs the best game i have played, i really recomend trying all game modes they are soo differnt and all soo fun!
3251	1	a	This Game is SO realistic it took me 54 hours to get my first sniper kill
2903	1	a	This game is simply amazing, let me tell you why. If you buy this game for it's default gamemode just don't do it well, if you want to you can but it's really boring, i bought this game mainly for Battle Royale and Roleplay (Arma Life, Altis Life). I suggest this game to be played with friends so it won't become boring. Roleplay is love, Roleplay is life.
5236	0	a	There's a famous World War I quote that says warfare is 'Months of boredom punctuated by moments of extreme terror.' Replace 'terror' with 'frustration' and this game does, indeed, give you the True Combat experience written on the tin.  From the description and tutorial missions, I was expecting a military simulation with experiences like 'The commander ordered my squad over the radio to go to grid point 134-190 and hold the bridge, so we mounted up in an APC and fought out way there to hold the line against the enemy advance.' Basically, I expected a much deeper and more realistic version of Battlefield -- like the Falcon 3.0 and Gunship 2000 military sims I played when I was a teenager but with infantry and tanks and tactics and whatnot.  What I got is... nothing like that.  The single-player is more like what I would call a 'walking forward simulator.' Seriously, my left middle finger started going numb from holding down W while following the squad leader character across a field for 15 minutes while only encountering two enemies. Of course, when I DID encounter enemies I tended to get shot in the head pretty quickly because the AI can see right through the oh-so-realistic scrub brush that covers the landscape whereas all I could see was the tangle of bushes in front of my face with a big red 'TARGET' box floating in the middle of them. Then the squad leader guy stepped on a landmine (the only one in the world apparently -- of all the luck!) and I started following some other guys across another field for even longer, only this time with an ambush of several lethal bushes a few minutes out from the save point.  After snoozing my way all across the field and then getting killed in the same spot about a dozen times I thought 'Okay, maybe the real draw here is the realistic chain-of-command combined arms multiplayer scenarios, let me try that.' So, I popped into multiplayer... and didn't see any of that either.   There were scads of 'RPG' servers where I could play as a random villager, AKA playing Walking Foward Simulator toward the corn field at the edge of town and trying to earn a bit of money to buy food at the market and not starve. True combat gameplay, right?  There were 'Wasteland' servers where you spawn in the middle of the continent somewhere with nobody around and only a vague suggestion of what you'r supposed to be doing ('fortify a base, gather supplies and hoard them') and of course a half-hour walk to the nearest point of interest. I wandered around the airport for 10 minutes looking for supplies or a vehicle, found nothing, shrugged and disconnected.  There were also 'King of the Hill' servers which at least featured combat. Well, actually they mostly featured waiting for helicopters to respawn. The objective was to go from my team's base to occupy a town about 1.5 kilometers away, which equated to a half-hour walk, a ten-minute drive (assuming you didn't run over a bush, which would pop your tire and then it's back to the half-hour walk) or a one-minute helicopter ride. So, helicopter was the obvious choice, but those only spawn every few minutes. Half the time some jerk would crash his truck into the helicopter and destroy it so we'd have to wait again. On the occasions I actually got to the airspace over the town, I would jump out of the helicopter, open my parachute, and generally be shot to death while dangling in the air. The one time I parachuted out early and walked for a minute to get to the town, I survived for a good while sneaking into the town but didn't run into any enemies to fight... eventually I got bored of that and ran to a tower to see if I could snipe people from the top, but as soon as I peeked out over the railing I got shot in the head.  So, was it realistic? You bet. Months of boredom punctuated by moments of extreme frustration. Was it fun? Not really. I had a lot more fun playing LUFTRAUSERS while waiting for it to download. Overall a colossal disappointment. I'm so glad it was a 'free trial weekend' -- I would have cried tears of rage if I had actually paid for this thing.
4573	1	a	This price is outragous, i cant speand this kind of cash. sure this game is great but still, i want it but for like 20$ pliz.  
2733	1	a	this is 11/10 died and waited 5 minutues only to drown 9 times in the corner of the map. Would Reccomend this game to those with Aquaphobia. 11/10 would drown again
5195	0	a	This game is a really clunky, boring, running simulator with a lot of pretentious, self-important kids who wish they could've joined the army but had to settle for ordering people around in a video game for no reason. The controls are awful, the graphics are mediocre, and the gameplay is boring because there isn't any. It's mostly just a running sim.
4506	1	a	This is an ever developing MilSim. awesome realism and with the community mods out there, what more can you ask for?!  Get it you will so enjoy it.
805	1	a	This is ARMA. This is no joke. The war is no joke.  Sometimes it's broken, sometimes it breaks you legs when you hope over fence, sometimes it lags. But it's still the best damn military game out there.  Either play it SP or MP, it looks wonderful, it sounds wonderful and feels wonderful.  There's nothing like hiding in the bush for 30 minutes to kill someone without them knowing where it came from.  Also gamemodes like altislife, invade the island or wasteland are worth a try. Tons of fun and I mean TONS.    
3462	1	a	My mother would probably scorn me by saying this about any media related to war, but...  This game is magnificent, beautiful, epic and brilliant. the sound-track is not too bad either! I absolutely love the way the game controls, especially compared to the stiff nature of its predecessor, Arma 2. This is particularly noticable when focusing on vehicles. In other words the vehicles handle like a dream due to the improved physics model (PhysX). apart from the third party physics engine implementation, the engine seems to have seen new additions and reconfigurations, such as the improved AI (still not perfect, especially when driving). The textures are decent, considering the scale of the game, but definatly an improvement over Arma 2. Animations are miles better. The details of objects such as weapons, vehicles and various common geometry scattered around the large expanse of the two vanilla maps (Stratis and Altis), are great!   I find great delight in oogling at such a realistic landscape, which in the case of the vanilla maps, apparently are modelled from real locations, Agios Efstratios (Stratis) and Lemnos (Altis)! There is a lot of content on offer with Arma 3, notably the ZEUS gamemode which is really exciting to play. Its when a player takes control of sort of an RTS perspective, defending, attacking and messing around with spawning objects and AI while other players run around as normal soldiers, adapting to the unpredictability of ZEUS's actions. It's quite a fun game mode and no two sessions are the same. There are a load of other standard game modes along with the ability to play scenarios either made with the editor, workshop or built in ones such as 'Escape from Altis', which is one of my favourite scenarios provided by BIS, its great to play with some friends. In fact, with a clan or a load of friends this game is a lot more fun. Don't get me wrong the Single player content which is similar, is also really really good.   Speaking of the single player experience, one of the most notable additions to this iteration of the series is the decent campaign. missions are good and diverse, making use of the space it has to play with. As well as the good voice acting, which seems to immerse me into the war torn greek islands of Stratis and Altis.  Despite all the good things in the game, of course it has problems. One that sticks out like a sore thumb to me is the performace relative to the hardware. Also the fact that the game does not seem to spread the workload across all four of the cores my CPU has to offer; The AI only take one thread, causing servere framerate loss when trying to play with lots of troops running around. Which is what I enjoy doing in sandbox games like this, most of the time. Servers seem to have problems, too. As connecting to a friends, has failed on multiple occasions, seeming to be randomly stubborn towards other players joining your server, despite inviting them.  This is no casual shooter. This is a military simulation. This is ARMA.....3.................puts glasses on, gets up, walks off into the distance.  &lt;obligatory 10/10 ign mlg 420 reference&gt;
866	1	a	Definitely YES! one of the best games I ever played and the biggest in content by far. You will never find yourself out of content here!
4870	1	a	Definetly a very fun game. The recent DLC that they released, Apex, I think is slightly over priced, and you should wait for the price to go down or for it to go on sale, but it's also worth it. A lot of work went into this game and is a lot of fun with friends. There are a lot of awsome mods for this game that really add to this game's worth, as well as a lot of fun life servers. But it can get kind of lonely without friends to play with, so defnetly consider that. I would give it a 9/10.
1981	1	a	IMO Game is ok, not for the faint of heart or easily upset.  
4398	1	a	Smoke heroin, sniff weed, inject cocaine and worship Satan.. Oh, and Arma is awesome despite the low fps... just don't come with a ''BF or CoD mentality'' here, this is the real â¥â¥â¥â¥...
1911	1	a	You get to play with real life military people and 12 years old kids...  i didn't play much there are countless things you can do ....10/10  
5229	0	a	The DLC policy of todays game developers is the worst possible thing that might ever come.   Arma 3 has limited content, but guess what? If you pay extra, you get extra content. Why sell full game once, when you can divide it into pieces and sell in parts?  I do not recommend.
3631	1	a	Best military simulation game out there. Great sandbox with incredible modability and community support. You will find no other game with the same amout of teamplay and immerssion. It suffers from bad performance, occassional bugs, silly physics and semi-acceptable DLC policy.  Strives when played with an organized group. With support of many advanced modifications it shows its full potential.
2408	1	a	best military simulation ever
2177	1	a	This game made me realize that I can play something at 15 fps and love it.  EDIT: Upgraded PC, now I get a smooth 60 fps and love it even more
3707	1	a	One of the best games i ever played,so many mods,missions..every pearson can find somethink in arma that can enjoy
5378	1	a	If you enjoyed Codemasters âOperation Flashpointâ in 2001, then you will absolutely love ARMA III. ARMA III takes place on two different islands: Altis &amp; Stratis. Stratis is 19 square kilometers (7.3 sq. km), with few roads and rugged forested terrian. Altis, on the other hand, is huge at 270 square kilometers (104.2 sq. mi.), with lots of roads and terrian of mostly rolling hills. However, only ~5% of the roads on Altis are paved.  There is a lot of detail put in this game, including some indigenous fauna, such as snakes, rabbits, goats, dogs, insects, and a wide variety of fish and other sea critters. They do not do anything but move around, but it adds to the realism. Did I mention snakes? There are a huge number of snakes on Altis.  Movement is not restricted. Meaning, you can move anywhere you like. Including using a re-breather to dive off the coast of either island to investigate ship wrecks, just for kicks. There are lots of vehicles to choose from, both civilian and military. Weapons, ammunition, and equipment can be taken from the dead. However, only take what you can carry during the missions. If you put anything in vehicles they will disappear once you return from your required mission or scouting mission. You will only be allowed to keep the items you are actually carrying.  The game includes a single-player campaign broken into three episodes:  Survive = 8 required missions, plus 6 optional scouting missions Adapt = 9 required missions, plus 8 optional scouting missions. Win = 6 required missions, no optional scouting missions.  When you complete the first required mission for each episode, return to base, and told to report in â don't. If you report in, then you will be assigned the next required mission. Instead, go to where a group of your fellow soldiers are standing/sitting, and listen to what they have to say. This is how you get optional missions. Then go off on a scouting patrol to complete the mission, if you so desire. When you have completed your scouting mission(s), then return to base and report in for your next required mission.  All the missions, except for the last one, are linear and static. Meaning, nothing you do will change the course of events. Except for the last mission. In the last mission you have to make a decision, and that decision will determine the outcome of the mission.  There is a steep learning curve, and that can get a little frustrating at the beginning. If you are new to ARMA III, then I recommend enabling the âSave Gamesâ in the Game Options settings and save often to help alleviate that frustration. The Survive missions are all solo, so you have time to adapt and learn the controls. The Adapt and Win missions team you up with a fireteam at your command. By the time you complete the campaign (~30 hours) you should be familiar with giving your fireteam commands, both individually and as a group.  ARMA III is more than just a âFirst-Person-Shooter,â it is a first-person combat simulator. The weight of your equipment is taken into consideration and will effect your movement and endurance. The three different stances (prone, crouching, and standing) will effect how much your weapon recoils, which will effect how quickly you can target an enemy. Standing while trying to hit a moving target at 1,000 meters is not recommended.  ARMA III allows user-developed mods, and also includes DLCs. Once you have completed the campaign, and want more single-player or multiplayer campaigns, then I recommend subscribing to the âDynamic Universal War Systemâ in the Steam Workshop. The DUWS mod will randomly create new campaigns, with as many missions as you desire. The goal of the campaign is always the same â control of the island.  There are still some minor bugs that need to be worked out, but it is very playable as is. I definitely recommend ARMA III.
3422	1	a	Killed a guy over 1100 meters with the gm6 lynx. I had the best â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.  10/10
4516	0	a	I bough this game and was thinking how cool it was gonna be by watching videos. Sadly, the game nees to have a a buffy computer to have great experience and you need to download/pay for a ton of stuff to be able to play on most servers because it seems like vanilla servers are dead. I don't konw.. On the search system I tried to find TDM DM CPTF but couldn't find any and if I browsed for one I would need to pay for the apex dlc :/ Honestly this might be just me who doesn't quite have enough experience to know how this game works and stuff you can do :P I'll update this if I feel like this might be a good game after all. I have to say that if you like realistic military games then this is the perfect one, it has almost everything that you would have in the army! Hopefully for my future playings I might be able to enjoy it as my wish was to since the start.
150	1	a	This game features a lot more than it may seem. It's got lots of gamemodes and different experiences even if you do play the same gamemode over and over. Everytime you play will be a different experience, may it be your role, the difficulty, or the ai. It's all different every time. You can find a lot of funny moments where the game will glitch out on you a bit but it's not really game-breaking, it's just a moment you can laugh about. Plus the amount of customization in the game is unbelievable, There's so much different changes you can do to the game, from changing your character's voice or face, up to making a whole addon and even more. Im not gonna say the game's completely perfect though. The main problem may be the community, but from time to time you'll not meet with that problem; some people will be nice to you and help you if you're a newbie to the game, and some will just go hard on you and troll you but those guys are rare, as people dont appreciate them on the servers. The gameplay; Now that is one hard question to answer. The gameplay mostly matters about you, and the gamemode, how you want to play, will still be valid, but you are restricted to thinking a lot about your actions or you'll get shot by some guy from 800 meters while he's only using a simple rifle with no scope. As you would guess, another problem is the AI, sometimes it may act rediculous and sometimes it's just the best AI you can find in a game. now, im not gonna go over the gamemodes here as it's better to find out yourselves, but i'll just say that King Of The Hill, Wasteland(mostly fun with friends), and Zeus(you'll be most likely to spend days on this one) are the ones i recommend. The community: The community has an endless array of addons you could use to change your game and/or experience. I'm not gonna say much about it except this but there's alot you can say about the community. The Engine: this game requires a beefy pc(currently at its state) but the engine is brilliant, It can run alot of data without having to give you frame drops or hard CPU usage. The engine is mostly dependant rather more on the RAM than the CPU, i recommend atleast 6-12 RAM for this game if you're gonna play it alot.  Overall: The game's worth a shot for people who like to plan their moves and think about what they do it before they do it, altough you will find mostly funny moments and non-serious moments in multiplayer but less than serious moments that are mostly enjoyable. Certain people refer to this as a 'Walking Simulator' but the point is that ArmA III is mainly focused on infantry and combined arms, you WILL find yourself walking and running alot to objectives, but that's how it is in real life too. The game is focused on reality and will be a hard challenge for people who arent used to this type of gaming. You can find alot to do in this like commanding AI and/or players, which is always hard at the start, and participating in large assaults on towns such as Kavala. In my opinion, ArmA III is worth a shot.  -Lankercool, Commander and Soldier, also regular Zeus player in the ArmA III Community.

5	1	a	 This review is a little lengthy, so if you just want to know why I recommend this game skip the  Results  and read from there.   Age of Empires III not only lives up, but pushes forward the great series that is Age of Empires. Most people compare it as being weaker than its predecessor Age of Empires II, but I find that these people tend to not see the greatness in this game. It seems in this Age of Empires the game became more realistic, in that the Colonial Era was a point in time when no longer were kingdoms limited in wealth by the amount of gold they could mine. Instead it brings in new Cash Crops, which allow each nation to produce Gold outside of traditional methods.    Campaign:  This is a great game with an in-depth campaign that goes through the stories of a Scottish Explorer and his sons/daughters. The campaign is interesting and introduces different styles of gameplay from macro-managing to micro-managing with scavenging and hording. Definitely worth the play through, for Age of Empires III and Age of Empires III: War Chiefs. Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties is fun, but the campaign has nothing to do with either of the other two expansions.    Gameplay:  Age of Empires III offers a brilliant combat system that no longer requires precise delegation of finite resources, but allows for macro-scale battle. Allowing some players to turtle and others to expand, depending on your gameplay you can grow or stay at home. Mining gold and gathering food will always garnish better results than farming gold and food. Not only can you focus different resource harvesting strategies, but you can also use different strategies in your combat choices. You can buy mercenaries which cost only gold, or even capture native towns and create tribal units. This can allow you to vary your tactics based on your environment as well as your team.    Teams:  This game introduces new challenges with Teams that are complex and highly differentiated, unlike in the predecessors where each team essentially was the same as the last minus a few shifts in upgrade options and one special unit (plus two special upgrades). Age of Empires III and its two expansions offer a variety of teams which include peoples of Europe, Americas, and Asia. Age of Empires III includes the Spanish, British, French, Portuguese, Dutch, Germans, Russians, and Ottomans. Age of Empires III: War Chiefs then offer three more teams including The Aztecs, Sioux, and Iroquois. Finally Age of Empires III: Asian Dynasties adds an additional three teams the Indians, Chinese, and Japanese.    Hints:  If you actually want to enjoy this game make sure you edit your cities in order to get all the cards, as earning all the cards takes more than one lifetime. I have owned all three of these games before they were on steam and I put over +300 hours into it still to not have one civilization at maximum level.    Results:  If you enjoy real time strategy games, enjoy managing an economy, epic large battles, and don't like excessive micromanaging then this is the game for you. It offers brilliant combat with amazing scenery. The unit mapping is rather brilliant and the variety of maps keeps you constantly wanting to play more.   Pros: +Fun campaign with a rather interesting story (for a strategy game). +High level of variability in teams +Allowing for turtle or rushing player types +Good difficulty curve in AI (allowing boosting resource harvest rates to find the best balance of difficulty) +Each civilization is like a whole new game +On map bonuses to give reasons for exploring and moving quick across the map. +Brilliant strategy diversification with special tribal towns on each map type, and special mercenary units for each map.  +Many different types of gameplay which keep the skirmishes from seeming repetitive.  +Loads of cards to choose from allowing you to choose if you want to Turtle, Rush, or Support.   Cons: -Leveling civilizations is rather dull (just edit the text file) -You cannot select your AI team membersâ cards, which means they will just use resource cards, villagers, and soldiers (not team cards). -Some civilizations seem unbalanced. (figure it out for yourself as we all have our views on this). -Rather than producing names for the map choices they are named after states (which can be really hard to guess what type of map you will get if you're not familiar with US Geography). -You can only have two teams in skirmish mode, which is really annoying if you used to like playing 2v2v2v2.  -You cannot have repeat civilizations; this means there is only one England per map.
312	1	a	I highly recommend getting this game, it has so much content and I have so far met so many friends by playing it! The Atlis Life game mode is my favorite and it takes you on a real life experience of surviving on an island with cops, rebels and civilians. You will have to do many things such as drug runs to get money, rob people, raid cities, etc. the new apex dlc just adds to how fun this game is, please get it to see if you like it and if not just return it :)
953	1	a	It is one of the most amazing games I played over the course of this year!
1004	1	a	over all this game rocks excellent graphics and gameplay and if u got arma 3 launcher lots of mods to play,but now at 73.00 dollars not worth it as it was made in 2013 and you gota buy premiun stuff,gear and guns what a joke greedy developers ,maybe wait for steam sale to buy, i got it for 36 dollars and its worth every dollar but wouldnt pay anymore than that.
1027	1	a	My time playing Arma 3    Started game Went on to a Altis life server  Spawned wearing a Hello kitty t-shirt  Dun. 100000/10
1332	1	a	The best simulation of the military forces,with so many mods who is so fun.
52	1	a	Probably played over 2000 hours on this combined with my disc copy. When's AOE4, yeah?
2433	1	a	From riding in a go-kart attached to a helicopter to stealing peoples organs for money(not that i do that :P). One of the best games ive ever played!
5385	1	a	game isnt realistic tbqh if i was really a solider i wouldbe owning n000bs and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ womyn like are they mad?
2604	1	a	Fun milsim with great comunity servers and gamemodes
2357	1	a	YES I LOVE THIS GAME! I ALWAYS GET KIDNAPPED! ITS ALWAYS A FUN WAY TO LEARN WHY PEOPLE KIDNAP YOU FOR COCAINE...
897	1	a	This is one of the best games I've played so far - its so many gamemodes and maps you can download from the workshop that is very nicely built. Every games has it's ups and downs, but theres nothing in Arma that really makes you think that this is a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. 9/10 due to some weird physics.
933	1	a	When i started playing this game I noticed it was lagging so I changed the settings to get it running right then i joined a server i killed a guy and his arms started flailing after that my game crashed...  My pc said logic.exe has stopped working Windows is checking for a solution to the problem  10/10 would crash logic.exe again
347	1	a	10/10 like Skyrim with guns  Also I can't see â¥â¥â¥â¥.
2539	1	a	Amazing title with amzing graphics. The difference between this and Arma 2 whilch i also owned is unbeleivable. New features include the option to attack from water with scuba divers, 230km open world with most buildings enterable a definate must buy for any FPS fan.
646	1	a	I have almost 1,400 hours as of this writing. I started from day one of alpha. This is the closest thing to a true sandbox with features of a proper FPS and a 'lite' flight sim. It's a war in a box.
798	1	a	Very fun if you like RPG and Hunger games. ( Atlis Life RPG, Battle Royale hungergames)
3969	1	a	This game is a sandbox, and what you get out of it is what your imagination or the community behind you puts into it.
1924	1	a	real combat - walk around  back hurts tired bored finally get some action call in  wait for approval to engage shoot like 3 rounds  artillery â¥â¥â¥â¥s â¥â¥â¥â¥ up keep walking get CIB  yey
5292	1	a	Wish I didn't get rid of this game
157	1	a	Arma 3 isn't game... its a way of life.  I know this now because I am one with this game. I am this game. This game is me.  After 1564.2 hours invested in this game... I have come to the conclusion that Arma 3 isn't a video game but a government research project into alternate reality simulations. This isn't a game... it is their first draft of the Matrix.  I... I have done things in this alternate reality that I never thought I'd do... I learned how to fly helicopters at terrifying speeds just inches from the ground and I've dropped scores and scores of fine young soldiers into battle. I have used a supply crate as a helicopter-borne wrecking ball. I have learned how to operate rocket launchers with extreme prejudice and impunity.  In one instance, I became a heroin running gang-leader that got into an epic shoot out with the police that ended up with me flying away in a stolen helicopter high on adrenaline (and a little cocaine)... then shortly after that I was in a high-speed police chase that ended the lives of several good police officers in fiery explosive deaths as their cars tumbled and rolled around corners as I zipped away at 300km+ in the worlds fastest Prius. I have sung Kumbaya over a barrel fire at a meth lab with my mortal enemies.  I once crashed a jet straight into a single enemy soldier because God Bless America, god dangit!  Most importantly - I've learned from this game. This game has taught me a lot of stuff... like that stairs can straight up kill you. I moved to a single story house because of this and I am happy to report that no stairs have tried to kill me since! I have also stopped climbing on and around rocks because they can swallow you and you'll never get out of the rock... I have put up posters all around my neighborhood advising parents to keep their children away from stairs and rocks, lest they end up dead or swallowed whole!  If I had to look back on it, I'd say my feelings are like Lois Griffin in this clip -  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlHTPDDguF4  - WHAT DID I DO??!?! WHAT DID I DOOOO!?!?!? *Wretches* - I mean that in the best way possible... what a delightful waste of time... way too much time!
2354	1	a	This is war..
1869	1	a	This game is a lot like sex, you play around for a few hours and pass out at 4am.
4399	1	a	10/10 would have a terrorist attack in the general store again.
3599	1	a	So I got the Exile Mod installed and ran about 1 hour around Esseker looking for supplies. I see a guy around a hospital and he looks unarmed, just like me. I ran to him and we started talking. Soon after I was handcuffed and naked in the open. He sayed he'd comeback with something to free me. 'Well, this is all I've got' - he says. Gets executed.  11/10 would socialize in a harsh apocaliptic wasteland again
1093	1	a	words can't describe how much i love this game  ARMA IS LOVE ARMA IS LIFE
2745	1	a	1000+ Hours of awesomeness
3183	1	a	what more can be said about arma? well not much. the base game is good, i went more into the modded games and to be honest its a shame the way things have gone in the modding community. the only one i can say i enjoy at this point is the exile mod. those guys are doing some great things and hopefully will continue too. so manny of the modders all have got a attitude 'this is my mod, you cant use it' its actually sad. Then you got the game creator that hasnt helped the situation at all. at this point there are other games out now that i would recomend over this but it does still have some good points.
2234	1	a	GET IT!
5129	0	a	Worst game ever i seen. You are just running. The game is about running. Don't buy !
3325	1	a	Wonderful game. heavily moddable by the community. Would reccomend this for the simluator aspect. its full on immersive gameplay and fire fights.
1478	1	a	Sooo good! Much play, much enjoyment!
3014	1	a	When Operation Flashpoint came out in 2002, I was pleasantly surprized that the Bohemia Interactive Studio creators of the game managed to finally make a military simulation that surpassed all other competitors. I still play it, but its successors, ARMA, ARMA2, and now ARMA 3 take this sim to new heights. As a US Army combat Veteran, I can state from my military experience that ARMA 3 tops the list of all FPS sims to date. ARMA 3 involves teamwork, self-discipline, and developing strategy to defeat the enemy. This sim is not for 'run and gun' players. 
50	1	a	Its different from the AOE 1 &amp; 2 style , with more choices , rpg like , enhanced better graphics etc.  -Story is awesome if you will choose to play campaign , 3 stories , each one is better than another. -The difficulty with this one is reasonable , i mean unlike AOE 1 &amp; 2 campaigns , you have to be so pro to finish them without cheats , this one will let you finish the campaign with no cheats. -The purchasing unit in this game is intersting , saves alot of time than previous AOE's , for example you could build 5 units in 1 queue instead of 1 by 1 , theres also town supplies that you can get them every 4 mins ~ ( you get to choose ur cargo and set up before starting game ). -This type of games aint about graphics i know , but this game's graphics are fairly nice and pleaseing to see. -When you're done with the main story , you could still play customized battles , as you will gain experince that will allow you to level up ur own town , with way more more cards/choices/upgrades than you had in story mode.   Either you're going to play it alone or with friends , its so much fun. i'd recommend buying this game in full/sale prices , worth it anyway. 9.5/10.
1769	1	a	This game rocks!!!
3649	1	a	great game.
5239	0	a	GTX 970 OC + i7 4790K OC get no more than 40FPS on reccommended settings  this is enjoy
4634	1	a	this is a good game!
1088	1	a	I've ran more miles in this game than I have in real life.
828	1	a	Awesome Game! Like the customizations that you can do to make this game more realistic. Fun to play with freinds! a Must have!
3977	1	a	It's ight 9.99/10
4680	1	a	yeah i reccomend it as i crash all the time but im hoping to fix that soon and the times ive been able to play it was a fun time killing ai 
1829	1	a	this game is perfect to play with friends and even better with the various mods you can install and play, can be buggy at times but is overall a great experience and super fun game! 9/10
3510	1	a	Great game 
2496	1	a	I was pretty good at arma 2, so I thought the arma 3 campaign was going to be fun and really easy.   Iv'e only raged quit to one game in my life That game is arma 3, I struggled through the tutorial and quit on the prologue.  Now I'm a lot better and the game is super fun!
4550	1	a	Really great game. Put in so many hours. Different types of game play and many mods. I fully recommend this game.
4321	1	a	This game has taken away hours of my life. I hate my life so this game is great. 10/10
283	1	a	Fantastic game already! Everything I wanted improved from ARMA and ARMA2 is improved in ARMA3 Alpha. The controls, animations and movement is sooo much better now, not clunky and meh like previous games in the series.  Yet it still keeps that great realism that we love the series for. It is in great shape so far for an alpha version. Cannot wait to see what the full version offers! How did they get it to run better and look better than ARMA2? Pretty impressive!  Get it now, maybe see ya online!  **Years later, End of Feb, 2016 and the game is vastly improved in many ways. One of the best shooters of all time imo, so much to do in this game and so many options, from online games like Altis Life, Breaking Point and Battle Royale. I have over 200 hours on this game now and I am sure many more in the future**
3088	1	a	this game is very good u should get it 
741	1	a	Arma 3 enhances on the Arma 2 experience by running better and expanding on features to make it a lot more of a smooth experience. With Arma 2 movement was clunky and sometimes that could have gotten you killed in a firefight because you couldn't get in cover because of the really bad control scheme, however with Arma 3 that is fixed with the stances system. The vehicles of Arma 3 are a lot better than Arma 2, it works. I can't wait until mods like ACE are released on Arma 3 expanding on the experience even more. It's well worth the price.   Although the content is slightly lacking, the game expands on Arma 2 loads and I'm sure an expansion pack like Operation Arrowhead will appear for Arma 3 aswell.  Buy it, well worth it.
1537	1	a	This game is cool
4336	0	a	Banned from battleye for no reason DONT BUY THIS GAME U GONNA WASTE YOUR MONEY
4430	1	a	Its not COD 0/10 -ign
3355	1	a	Great game but the people are very hostile, watch a few gameplays before playing you will more than likely get rekt otherwise
1881	1	a	This is one of the best PC games I have ever played, I love how you can play so many different gamemodes. The realism servers are great and this game has just so much to offer. Looking at it as a military simulation game, It certainly simulates it better than any other military game I have EVER played. I would highly recommend this game to anyone :D
216	1	a	Amazing Game, you all need to pick this up if you like realistic combat. Harsh for any new player to master but when you get the the feel of the game and master the controls it's great fun!
4417	1	a	10/10 -Im Hillary Clinton and I approve of this message.
2754	1	a	Arma 3 is obviously a better Arma 2, in many ways. Many positives to the game. One of which is the addition of the Steam Workshop. To download missions for Co-Op and Singleplayer. There's no hastle of going to  www.armaholic.com  and downloading missions. Arma 3 is overpriced though...
342	1	a	Graphics 8.9/10 Pretty game  Gameplay 4/10 too many bugs it feels very unstable at stages  Singleplayer 4/10 HARD But fun at stages  Multiplayer 8/10 Only Lives Up To ItÂ´s Potential With Friends  Controls 5/10 You use many of you buttons and many in the wrong place  Great Multiplayer With Friends But A Bit Too Many Bugs
3431	1	a	One of the best games i ever played! I love the game in general but the mods like Atlatis life, Breaking point are so fun..  I really think everyone shoud try this game out!
3581	1	a	Very good game with horrible optimalization (may be caused by my laptop). I love this game even when I have low fps. Best part of this game begins, when you mod it!
5352	0	a	If you like never being able to leave spawn, 12 year olds screaming in your ears and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ hitler level admins banning you because you called them out for their own rules then buy this game other than that â¥â¥â¥â¥ this and â¥â¥â¥â¥ you arma i tried to love this game but nawh im done same â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t day in day out peace out and ill be back when you can make this an enjoyable game again.
3356	1	a	Hello Community,  Arma 3 is in my opinion one of the best games I ever played. You have so many options how you can play this game. You want.. Survival.. RP.. PvP.. PvE.. Arma 3 give it all to you. So if you ask me you should buy this f*cking game and play the shiit out of it.   Greetings Zadary!
672	1	a	i can craw around on the dirt and pretend to be a worm greatest game i've ever played
1086	1	a	A huge step up from previous ARMA titles, graphically and mechanics wise. A3 has addressed nearly all the features I wanted added to increase immersion and to make the game a bit more fluid.  Although set in the 2030's, A3 retains its grounding in realism and all the military equipment in this game exists or could exist in 2013 .  Pick it up early to save yourself about $20 before the games full release.
2878	1	a	It's an awesome game
1767	1	a	played 1 hour, got banned  gg would get banned again 10/10
2120	1	a	Love this game. So many different things you are able to choose from. if you havent tried it, you are sadly missing out!
202	1	a	Great game. Hour-long sessions of:  'Yes, I can hear the gunshots.' 'Yes, I know they're almost hitting us.' 'No, I don't know where they're coming from.'
4866	1	a	It's a very good game and lots of fun, especially with some of the mods you can download.
2151	1	a	I'll go ahead and say that I've played this since the Alpha stage of the game and I have to say that ArmA III has come a long way since then.  ArmA III is a great way for you to explore a more detailed tactical shooter. This is more than shooter with pretty maps and sights. This is more than just a 'Shoot 'em up and knock 'em down' kind of game. This IS a simulation, a simulation of what armed combat can look like in reality, unlike the movies and shows. YOU are down there, boots on the ground, standing shoulder to shoulder with your squadmates and fighting to either seize a town or fighting for your life when you're the only one left. The sounds are down right amazing and the detail on the rifles are wonderful.  When you are with friends and fighting alongside others, communication is KEY to succeeding and achieving victory! Communicate with the people driving the tanks or any armored vehicle and combine arms to tackle enemy armor and air units, as well as communicating with the ones flying attack helos and jets. Combine all of those elements and you've got yourself an unforgetable experience of awesomeness. And all of this gets better if you find yourself a Mil-Sim unit!  You can specailize yourself in any MOS (Military Ocupational Specialty). From Rifleman to AT Specialist, helicopter and/or fighter pilot, you can learn all of this in this game!  Of course threre are mods which alters the realism of this game to a more hardcore level which I highly recommend you doing.  Ladies and gentlemen, if you are looking for a detailed Mil-Sim tactical shooter, then ArmA III is for you, remember, communication is the KEY to success!  Good luck, fellow virtual soldier!
480	1	a	Arma 3 is a military simulation game. Let me tell you about it.  First of all, some history.  All of these titles lasted a few years, with continuing updates. Operation Flashpoint came out in 2001, and was a very good game for it's time. ARMA: Armed Assault was released in 2006, and was also a very good game. ARMA 2 was released in 2009, and was probably the best WW2 shooter out there, if not the best shooter, and is still being played today. Arma 3 was released in 2013. Now, this little game is seriously the next gen stuff. With amazing graphics and sounds, a new story-rich campaign, a futuristic setting and beautiful, lush terrain on huge maps is what made it stand out at the time.  The game is set in the republic of Altis and Stratis, which are both small Greek islands, although they're MASSIVE for a game's map. There are three teams fighting for these islands, first of all are the locals, the AAF or Independents. They are the Altan Army Forces, and, because pressured by their local guerilla crisis, have made some European and American allies, NATO, or BLUFOR. Although, towards the end of the first episode of the campaign, there are 'entanglements' and the AAF decide to turn on NATO, and then CSAT, a a combination of Asian forces, teams with the AAF. Also, NATO is having a financial crisis. Oh, what fun.  It has a few original gamemodes, which were released with the game originally, but so many more have come from the vast modding community.  Altis Life, Wasteland, Invade and Annex and Breaking Point are just a few examples. I'll tell you a little bit about each.  First of all, Altis Life. It's a very exadurated take on real life. With cops, medics and civilians. As a civilian, you can make your money in legal ways, like apple picking and mining with a liscence, although you can make it in illegal ways like drugs and turtle poaching. You can also go to a rebel town and buy some illegal gear and do more illegal things.  As a cop, you'll have to stop all this illegal behaviour. Doing searches and inforcing the law, rebels will have to look out for these guys.  And medics, if you're injured, can come and revive you. May sound simple, but it's actually a very dangerous job. Here's a very good Altis Life server:  http://reignofterrorclan.enjin.com/   With Wasteland, you have your three teams, BLUFOR, OPFOR and Independent.  As BLUFOR or OPFOR, you have to work together with your team to kill the other team and the Independents, while getting money from missions or killing players to buy new things, like guns and veichles.  As an independent, you're in a massive free for all against the other teams and all the other independents, unless you group up with some others. Here's a very good Wasteland server:  https://www.gametracker.com/server_info/play.ultimatewasteland.com:2302/   With Breaking Point, it's a zombie game, so basically DayZ. DayZ started as an Arma 2 mod, which eventually became a standalone game. Now, however, it's also an Arma 3 mod. Scavenge for supplies, kill or befriend other players while watching out for zombies. Sign up to play here:  http://www.thezombieinfection.com/   Also, Invade and Annex is more of a slow paced military simulation. With classes, you can pick your role and fight against enemy AI for the islands. Using all of the game's original content and a little bit more, this gamemode is seriously some good fun if you're more of a strategic fighter.  It is overall an ultra realistic game, with tons of veichles, models and weapons, even very realistic weather and day - night cycles, and there's a lot more stuff from the modding community. It has a really steep price at $60, but I picked it up on special, and even if I did buy it for the original price, it's worth it. Trust me, it's worth it.  If my horrible explanation didn't help you, check out the Arma 3 Youtube channel. If it did help you, check it out anyway.  https://www.youtube.com/user/Arma3official   Thanks for reading my review and, if you decide to get the game, I hope to see you!  Frank
485	1	a	Brilliant army simulator, it offers so much more than just the base game. WIth custom missions workshop. and fully mod-able. its deffo a good buy. amazing for co op, multiplayer and single player. a massive improvement on arma 2.
1963	1	a	A small child was micspamming the entire audio from Monsters Inc. and then he died from falling from a plane.  It's pretty good.
5035	1	a	Who needs more than one video game when ARMA 3 has mods?
2219	1	a	Arma 3 is not a bad game. its fun in groups but also not to bad alone. It can be pretty heavy on payers with weak internet connection. you will die a million times and not know where the hell the shot came from but once you get into the swing of the game and how it runs. it becomes very enjoyable. PS watch out for jets they just seem to destory everyone
3535	1	a	Most action pack game yet, amazing two way to finish off the campaign. I really recommend this game if your into a lot of strategy and firefights.
725	1	a	Arma3 is where its at! I've been playing Arma since 2009 and I love it!
3143	1	a	It has it's flaws, but, Arma 3 for me is still possibly the finest war game out there.  This game is one for the gamers though, casual players be warned. Arma has always and hopefully always will have a tough learning curve. Enemies are accurate and deadly on even the easiest settings and the control system is complicated enough to make your head explode. From the numerous controls for simply running around, leaning around corners, commanding troops and changing optical sights, to the things like zeroing your sights and ranging up targets, Arma will have you confused for awhile.  Stick with it though and learn the game and you will realize you have to act like a soldier to survive.  Unlike many fps's, you simply cannot get away with blitzing around, guns blazing. Shots need to be accurate, cover is your only life saver and good use of tactics and planning will win out over Rambo-ing your way through. This makes for a wonderful game, very different to the majority of other games out there and a stand alone in terms of war simulation.  Is it war? No. Is it far closer than anything like Battlefield / CoD / Heroes and Generals etc....Yes, by a long long way.  Online is much the same thing, although, people tend to be a little worse than Ai's so you can get away with a little more. Some of the mod's of this game alone have gone on to warrant their own games (DayZ), which for me shows how different this game is compared to the rest of the market. A mod of this game is different enough to anything else out there, it got it's own stand alone game, not many other titles can say that.  Playing online isn't always easy. Skill is generally going to win out and that can be tough sometimes if you play online and are new to the game. The mod's (such as epoch), that start you with no gear can more be about finding the right server sometimes. I'm currently playing on two different servers, one is very full and packed full of people just wanting to kill you on sight, no warning, no nothing. The other is a generally quiet server, very friendly and much more survivor feeling. Both other great game play experiences, but of a very different nature. One has you avoiding anywhere built up and laying low a lot until you manage to get a weapon, then you start looking for oppurtunities to pinch gear and hold people up. The other has you heading into built up areas hoping to find vital equipment such as building materials, food, drink and weapons. You look to help others out and often find yourself leaving your safety to help those in need.    Now, the game isn't perfect. Time to talk flaws.  Bugs. There are a decent handful of bugs. I had one mission in the main game that all the cars spawned into the floor and I couldn't complete the mission (as part of the mission was to drive one of the said cars to a location).  Another had my artillery support stop working....leaving me to try and take out 4 tanks and about 2 dozen people with what amounted to sticks and stones.  Restarting these levels from scratch fixed both, but, can be tough to swallow if you found it a struggle getting that far the first time.  Online has bugs too. Climbing over stuff or falling a foot or two from something can sometimes result in injury. Doors will sometimes decide they will no longer work and will either not close or not unlock. A restart of the server (most restart every 4 hours) usually solves that problem though. Vehicles can simply despawn and lose you a lot of gear. The servers tend not to remember a lot of what goes on in the last 3-4 mins before a restart.  With most of the bugs in this game though, they are patched fairly quickly and although frustrating, aren't deal breakers for me. You're not required to own the DLC either to play on servers that have that DLC running (or so I was told) which is good value for money if you're thinking of being more an online player.    Overall, I'd give Arma 3 a 9/10 ........ Bugs removed, a larger single player set of campaigns and perhaps some slightly better optimising (which isn't bad) would push it to a 10.
2193	1	a	Very good war simulator. Excelent graphics 60fps w/ 3GB graphic card (high to medium settings). Great multiplayer.
4511	1	a	So realistic it'll give you PTSD.
4845	1	a	I have not played it, but looks cool. 10/10
3011	1	a	Walked for twenty minutes to car. Got hit by a rpg 100m away.  I still love this game.
2609	1	a	I love this game so much. The only downside that I have about it is when I join up on an Altis Life server, a lot of the police will just shoot you on site without you doing anything illegal. There are other servers though that the police are actually amazing and will role play well with you as long as you are not rude to them. Overall it's an amazing game and I love it so much.
1626	1	a	By far, the best single and multiplayer experiance ever.
2111	1	a	Ruined my life during finals week  10/10 would destroy GPA again
4660	1	a	After playing the entire ArmA series I have been very impressed with this game. It brings together many aspects that make it a game worth every penny. While some of the bohemia content is not as desirable as ArmA 2 the modding community has much more than made up for this. The biggest thing however is the fact is ArmA is meant to be played in large groups not as individuals but as cohesive groups which is why I highly advocate joining a realism/ milism unit. All in all I have been very impressed over the 1k hours ive put into this game and will contiue for many more hours to come.
314	1	a	Epic. comparing this to battlfield and cod is like comparing a private jet to ryanair to a bike
2397	1	a	The graphical beauty of this game is incredible and the game is among the most realistic combat games out there. However don't be mistaken this is by no means in the same catagory as other gun games out there. This does not play like an FPS at all, which in many cases I like. My only complaint with the series is how rough the game is with almost everything you do. Not going to rant on about it, but anyone who plays this can't deny that nothing you do flows very well, getting in a vehicle or doing something like hopping over a fence isn't quick and smooth. It almost feels like it stops the gameplay or combat... gets in the vehicle ...then it resumes. (hard to explain this given that makes it just sound like every other game but trust me when I say it isn't the same)   NOW TO MAKE UP FOR THAT COMPLAINT, the game is fantastic, you really do feel like a soldier, and the range of gamemodes you'll find on servers etc. is endless! Finally to wrap it up they give you two massive maps that allow for very fun fights.
4727	1	a	Good tactical, action, multiplayer game :) 10/10 A lot of weapons i like it !! :D
719	1	a	Shot a guy from 600m with a Katiba with a RCO scope 10/10 IGN for fun.
4794	1	a	This game has brought me hours of fun and i'm sure it will bring me many more. If you have the cash, pick it up ASAP!
1125	1	a	So far it's alright, but I still need a bit more time before deciding on how good it actually is.
2771	1	a	Breaking Point Mod!
2479	1	a	A beautiful looking game, with realism at it's finest. Great Gunplay, and well polished campaign. Multiplayer is incredible. Tons of Mod Support through Steam Workshop, and countless support for Third Party mods like Battle Royale. It's worth the money if it's on sale, and I couldn't recommend it enough.
2553	1	a	A great shooter and combat game. Unlike Call of Duty and Battlefield, they do not need to release a new one every year.
4512	1	a	its great
1371	1	a	Best game ever !!! The best OFP you can find.
495	1	a	OVERVIEW  Arma3 is the flagship of realistic modern day combat FPS. This game beats me up left right and center with it's mind blowing realism, and I just keep playing regardless of the pain! I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes realism and is ready for a seriously fun challenge.  ------------------------------------ MULTIPLAYER  First off, online play is awesome, even breathtaking if played right! There are many server hosters, mostly active during holiday seasons, who host massive scale role playing games. Even real life off-duty soldiers like to play this game, and quite often. In these scenarios, things are co-ordinated like real life operations by real life people, in real time. And these missions are 100% flexible, you can carry it out as you see fit! Or as your commanding officer sees fit.  HQ making the big decisions and laying down orders. Fireteams taking the orders down on the ground. Mechanised rolling armoured support. CAS providing support from the air. Recon taking the long shots. Diving teams, etc.  And every contributing player is a real person! No AI on your side. (For the Roleplaying Player vs AI missions)  There are also many other game modes to choose from. Deathmatch, King of the hill, even racing! And if not even that satisfies you, then you could just browse the workshop for other types of game modes. If you are a fan of DayZ then head over and download the Exile mod. Its very similar.  ------------------------------------ SINGLEPLAYER  There is a Singleplayer playmode called The Eastern Winds, where NATO fights for control of Altis after they lose control of it to CSAT forces. With the help of native populus you work your way up fighting with FIA till you are able to rejoin your NATO comrades.  The story mode is really great, and very long. Its flexibility could also leave space to play missions in a different way if you would like to.  ------------------------------------ STEAM WORKSHOP  The mods for this game are endless! Anything from extra weapons to a mod that makes helicopter flight even more realistic. Mods that give you new vehicles or clothes, to mods that add missions or overhaul game systems.  All mods are easily accessed from the game launcher so its not hard to turn them on and off at your own leisure. Some mods are not accepted on some servers.  ------------------------------------ PROS &amp; CONS  Pretty much everything above is a Pro, so I would use this space to talk about the cons. Pretty much the biggest problems in this game are cosmetic glitches. This includes things like falling into walls and through 2 story houses. Though most of your time is spent in the field, you should be careful moving between buildings.  Another thing is that the AI can be very dumb, like driving over teammates. And the AI is capable of spotting you through a keyhole over a 800m distance. It seems like it's getting better over time so I have faith in that! For me, it's just more of a challenge. Just don't engage at range with a pistol against the AI, you will have a hard time.  ------------------------------------ MAKE ARMA NOT WAR &lt;3
5054	0	a	Yeah 10/10 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing stupid, pay 40 dollars for the game no problem, goes to join a server = needs dlcs okay? Tried every server there is all need dlcs look there's an extra 50 bucks all up thanks Arma you â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t system
4630	1	a	This game is very realistic and i like it a lot. It has every thing guns, vehicles,editors, good AI, Its better than eny call of duty game
2285	1	a	It's â¥â¥â¥â¥ing amazing! Really fun to play, but has a bit of a learning curve. Can be hard tp play at time for people new to the Arma series. This game is a must buy for anyone who likes FPS games.
2545	1	a	I love this game :)
168	1	a	This is the best Golf simulator out there. You really can feel the swing in ur whole upper body as you go on killing people with your towed zamak beneath ur transport bird on wasteland sa-matra. And the crowd (victims) goes wild in the global chat 1/2 times you manage to score. This keeps you going for hours and hours. The occasional aa missile hitting you in the side makes for an even more interesting golf course as you will need to 'get out of the rough' and repair/re fuel the heli to get back on the fairway  12/10 will golf again
1847	1	a	Great game! Just finished the tutorial
4072	1	a	I play this game everyday. Its amazing!
5328	1	a	Great game if youre in a team with friends that played before
5353	1	a	Its a good game, but they need to stop being such stingy jews and lower the damn price.
3179	1	a	10/10
3515	1	a	Arma 3 is an excellent game but you have to know when to stop.
4982	1	a	great game,It's a must buy.
3083	1	a	It's not bad.
3877	1	a	-Driving along with highly valuable stuff in vehicle.  -See's other vehicle coming my way thinking nothing of it.  -Desync.  -Crashes into each other.  -Both vehicles explode.  10/10 WILL loose everything too desync again.
4953	0	a	The most boring game ever!
112	1	a	Does CoD allow you to be pinned down for 6 straight hours in a house while you cry hearing screaming and dieing?       Men Play Arma 
331	1	a	Man, doe be like comin out of the trees and â¥â¥â¥â¥, and you be all like 'Oh mayne, who hims that? You that' and your team all like 'nah, it ain't me, but it do' and you like 'Yah, it do' and then you both shoot him and â¥â¥â¥â¥, people droppin all around, man with helichopter come in all shootin missiles and â¥â¥â¥â¥, blowing up children and you like 'Yah, but there is the cav' and everyone else dying, but you not. Nah, you not.  
2359	1	a	My hours on record should speak for the game itself, its only in beta and already is such a fun game, sure the AI are a little buggy but wasteland, coop, hell even just playing helicopter tag is fun. Its a sandbox game so you can spawn in stuff in the editor and create a mission and then play it however you want to. One of the greats of our generation going beyond anything call of duty, battle field, halo have done or probably will do I highly recommend this game.
2764	1	a	It's very pretty and does it's job as my benchmark tool for computer hardware.
3860	1	a	Arma 3 is a good game [It may have bugs but often they are the funny bugs with twisted necks and stretching soldiers] Many mods are made for the game often mods create a lot of extra playtime in my case I bought this because of Arma 2 and how I enjoyed it. I would recommend others who are thinking about buying this to go ahead there is so much you can do. With that said the Dev team are always releasing patch fixes to add more shine to the game.
3720	1	a	it's a pretty good game if you enjoy playing with pizza faced nerds and danny devito. i, on the otherhand, prefer to play the more tactical 'Simcity 2000'. it's a real game for real gamers like me and not a casual like you.
1273	0	a	needs optimizations
11	1	a	Worthy of any RTS fans collection! Good classic strategic combat, well balanced against your building and resource management.  Although older game now it has held up well and also retains an active community.  Good multiplayer and extensive campaigns to play.    If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow  True Blue Reviews  for more recommendations! 
1484	1	a	I wanted to rewrite my review, since my prior review didn't give this game justice, and honestly makes made me look 8 when I wrote it. First off this game is amazing in the right mind set, you need to enjoy running 3 km, and then dying to someone 1km away, its can be a pain, but its fun if you now how to play. I love the aspect that you can create and play your own missions, and I think this really can bring a community together. One of the biggest aspects that make this game as big as it is modding, Dayz was the biggest breakthrough in modding for Arma 2 and it created a whole new chapter in Arma, and what it would become. There is so many mods you can play such as A3L, Dayz, Wasteland, Dom, Battle Royale, And those are just a few mods that the community could create  My Pros and Cons:  Pros:  Great Community Modding SinglePlayer  COOP Missions Weekly Updates Good DLC  Cons:  Terrible FPS Anti Cheat is flawed Servers tend to not show up Joining on friends is a pain  Things I'd like to see.  I'd like to see a COOP aspect added to singleplayer, playing alone is kinda boring at times.  Ability to turn off fatigue in single player, The AI's tend to get ahead since fatigue can really mess your player up.  Fixing Fps, This has been a recurring issue in Arma games, the fps is terrible (You can check my specs, its not my computer) I hope this gets fixed soon, but I don't have much hope.
1261	1	a	Arma 3 is an improvement and significant step forward over the previous in its franchise, securing its top spot as the go to for military simulation. Arma 3 makes big steps forward with huge worlds and more varied vehicles and weapons. With the clever integration of the Steam workshop, player-made content has never been easier to install and manage. A smart move by Bohemia Interactive because it's these fan based mods that are the backbone of Arma and will give Arma 3 endless hours of replayability. With the effortless downloading and installation of a huge library of player created mods, from team driven tactical scenarios to the the chaotic survival mods, it's a must have for any shooter enthusiast. 
339	1	a	Nothing gets real but this.
2674	1	a	I really like it. Htere are a ton of diffrent mods and things to do.
3105	1	a	Ok so to start things off, this game is by far the best millitary shooter I have ever played (and I have player ALOT). From the stunning realistic graphics, to the most realistic comat you can in a game, makes for this game to be a really fun, exiting and realistic combat.  This game takes millitary combat to a whole new level, it's massive open world landscpae provides for some hectic battles, from classic dogfights, to jets droping bombs on you, to sniping down your foes, to even just doing the classic gunsblazings tactic you'll never get board of.  So do I think this is a good game, ABSOLUTLY, and I 100% reccomand checking this out if you like a good old millitary shooter, and yet there is so much more I haven't talked about yet, and I'll leave that part up to you.  11/10: MUST GET NOW, JUST LEGIT GET IT, NOW, RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Have a great time out there on the field, soldiers... DISMISSED!!!
3295	1	a	One of the best games (if the the best) I've ever played. Was expecting the singleplayer campaign to be a bit longer with a few more missions but it still took me about a 100h to complete! I definitely recommend this game to any fps lover that can put in the time and effort to master the shooting mechanics.
2964	1	a	Its great Buy it now.
5149	1	a	It's trash but it's really good.
3031	1	a	Actually played a little of it, it was cool however you need god's gaming computer to run this.
2416	1	a	Kind of glitchy but a load of fun and an insane amount of depth.   If you are a fan of games with a good amount of tacticality, this is a must buy even at it's pricepoint.
3568	1	a	Nothing is more fun than blowing up Persians with homodachis.
1988	1	a	I SAY Play it its a great game :D
91	1	a	'Get off side chat' 10/10
1885	1	a	Obviously, i like the game.
3241	1	a	Great game so far! Loving all of the customization and community add ins. Check forums they help a ton
4663	1	a	I don't have lots of hours but its a ok game.
1492	1	a	This is the best game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  i did everthing that you can possiably imagine in Arma 3
1316	1	a	Playing Arma 3 in a tactical manner alongside random people you don't know, assigned to different squadrons fulfilling different roles on the battlefield is among the most rewarding multiplayer experiences I've had in gaming in a very long time.  Highly recommended combat sim, immersive and lots of features, combat stances, etc. 9/10
1615	1	a	The best installment of the Arma series so far. Laggy gameplay seems to have been fixed to the great extent, interesting and intensive, dramatic Single Player campaign reminds the original Operation Flashpoint times. Recommended for all tactical warfare simulation fans.
3656	1	a	ALthough it falls short in many ways its still a blast to play
4457	1	a	One of the best military sims out there. If you like immersion/sandbox, then you will love this.
451	1	a	High quality vegetation simulator with plenty of things to do
15	1	a	you can beat monkeys to death and steal their money
3041	1	a	very good ya
4470	1	a	oh soso good :3   This is one of the best games of forever :D  10/10 IGN 'kinda good i guess'
2292	1	a	If you like DayZ kinda action, and you are willing to RPG. Altis life Mod for Arma 3 is verry Cool, look up a good community and get your life going. Get a job: Pick Apples, peaches, Mine for Iron, copper, Salt and even Diamonds. Become a criminal, and pick, process weed, cocain or heroin. Become a Cop, arrest ppl. Search vehicles, and hunt people that have a price on their head. You can even become a rebel. Before you get a life on a server, read the rules of a server, the rules may vary on each server, if you want to become a cop, most of the time they want you white-listed. The server i play on the most: Serverfilter: Trinity Join me.
171	1	a	Best milsim game out there, huge community
1803	1	a	'Great game'
1111	1	a	Killed 15 players with my bomb vest, now i'm surrounded by 72 virgins (30 year old wizards and not models) in heaven. 9/11 would ISIS again.
1218	1	a	What the â¥â¥â¥â¥ is this new update? Why can't a company such as bohemia interactive understand a VERY simple concept such as stamina? Like in what world does a TRAINED soldier run out of breath afer like a couple of steps?
301	1	a	This is the definitive military experience, sure it might be rough around the edges and maybe it can be a bit unforgiving at times, but no other military shooter out there comes even close to what ARMA 3 offers, unlimited replayability, thousands of campaigns and scenarios, mods, coop, vehicles, exploration, and above all a sense of total inmersion.  With the upcoming free dlc, and a huge community behind it, Bohemia interactive have again struck gold, having played their games since Operation Flashpoint, it has been an awesome surprise to see how far they have taken the genre forward, although, be advised, Call of Warfare fans will be in for a shock as nothing they have learnt there will have much use in here!  The graphics are amazing, the movement and controls are the best in the series, but be advised, you will have to take time to learn the ins and outs of the game, as it is sometimes unforgiving of even the slightest mistakes, eventually you get the hang of it and this game really shines!  Must buy! Get your gun soldier and hit the dirt!
4784	0	a	If you played BF1942, you've played this.
2334	1	a	A fantastic game for those who love the ArmA series. The Game uns very smooth and there are many things to do with the editor and even the Multiplayer. Gaphics are insanes aswell as the animantions and even the gun play seems a bit better. i would recommend this game to any friends.  - this is a cpu intensive game and would recommend you to use a higher end cpu and gpu if needed.
408	1	a	went outside and immediately started scanning the bushes for snipers
4328	1	a	great game
315	1	a	Amazing game with the possibility of making real life scenarios and improving milatary tactics. Love it 10/10 and i would recommend it to everyone who is intrested :)
5301	1	a	Arma, the only game where you can call people who don't camp noobs.
1580	1	a	I heavily recommend Arma 3 as the best first and third person shooter.  Seriously this is how I feel about the common FPS games right now  COD - Know the basics of an FPS game  Battlefield - Know the basics of teamwork and squads  Arma 3 - Learn the advance stuff like compass bearings, map marking and the advance levels of the FPS element, as well as learning how to command a full military force.
2284	1	a	Brilliant best war simulator ever!
3544	1	a	10/10
2892	1	a	This game is really good if your like war and action games this will give you so much joy in it.
2484	1	a	Arma 3 a very good Open world shooter and a exelent military simulator  Even that i have less then 50h in this game i would say this is a very fun game to play 9/10  9/10 becouse some bugs that can kill you  P.s - DONT GO IN WATER
1324	1	a	Nice if u want to play mods!
5295	1	a	This game is hard. You jump out of a building-splat-dead. You are walking aroung- bang-dead. You are in a tank-mine explodes-dead. However,once you learn all of the tricks(about 75 hours for me) it starts to get really rewarding. This game is very immersive from the fact that you can shoot enemies from over 2 klicks, you can fly helicopters, fixed wing, and drones. You can drive tons of vehicles, or you can just walk around as a rifleman. Use the mission editor to create a mission to your liking, download mods to (nearly) perfect your game. A.I. is kinda glitchy, some textures aren't perfect but overall, FANTASTIC GAME. Seriously, one of my friends NEEDS to buy this so we can play together.
4492	1	a	8/10 Excellent game, great tactical shooter with first person and third person perspective. Lots of game modes and even more coming out all the time, so many to name and not enough words for them all. Great Campaign very challenging with many challenge modes to also play. Play with friends or by yourself in land, sea and air combat. Weaponry ranging from Pistols to Rocket launchers ATV's to Tanks Hummingbirds to Jets.
235	1	a	Smashed into a sign with a military truck, broke everything  11/10 Would eat nachos with.
1098	1	a	Awesome game   Great phyics and good preformance huge multiplayer + point . Alot of awesome mods eg exile and king of the hill and armageddon i recommend this game totaly worth the money , amazing game money well spent
4358	1	a	Killed by puhed the car 10/10 The best game ever+Best texture . Buy it !!!!!
3311	1	a	Nice game! King of the Hill &lt;3 If you want to play a game with friends together and you want to play with tactics...this game is awesome for that.
2303	1	a	Arma 3 is almost like Arma 2, besides alot of gameplay has changed! The guns now have attachments you can take on and off, clotching that you swip out with a drag'n drop on. Body armor actually works in this game, and mostly everything else does aswell Great game overall, I would highly recommend it if you have a BEAST computer as the maps are HUGE and eats up your framerate! :) 
1807	1	a	I've barely learned the controls.
907	1	a	This game is amazing .. That is all I have to say about that .. IF you into games that allow no limits to what you can do with it .. Arma is the game for you. With Modding supported from the start of the game and really the core of arma. Spending 60 bucks on Arma is more then worth it. I have over 1000 hours now into the Arma series and have yet to play any of the campian that BI made. Most of my time has been into Mods like Dayz and Epoch. The Communtiy in Arma is amazing. Modders put their heart and soul into making content for this game. Arma 3 is a game you will for sure get over 5 years of content for free out of. It is a must buy for any Hardcore FPS player, Hardcore RPG player or any one into Mil Sim stuff.
2755	1	a	its good game with a â¥â¥â¥â¥ engine
222	1	a	How i played this game : 1: Learn how to pilot a helicopter gg 2: Buy a Jet for the first time 3: Do backflips and sideflips 4: Crash into a wire 5: The jet explodes and the wire is fine 6: Disconnect and join another server 7: Find a squeaker, kidnapp him and take all his gear. 8: Tell him to stay in the field and we wont hurt him 9: Get into a helicopter, shoot him down and fly off 10: Feel bad, go back to pick him up 11: Get shot down with a tank 12: Get banned for killing him because he was an admin  10/10 would get banned by a squeaker again 
4225	1	a	Very good game. If you have played the Arma series before then you will know what you are in for. Lots of Mods and Missions to play online with friends. Also runs smooth on both my PC &amp; Laptop.
4242	1	a	its best game na
2195	1	a	I rate this game a 10/10 for their being no twelve's YAY!!! Plus all the awesome things you can do in this game.
696	1	a	Sick game 10/10 would bang
2029	1	a	This is by far the best combat simulator on the PC market.
2489	1	a	Many many mods for this game, from Epoch (like DayZ) to Paintballing and Go Karting. My personal favourite mod is wasteland, which requires no additional downloads (other than the data file which automatically downloads on joining the server). If you liked Arma 2, you will love Arma 3. The one thing I dislike nowadays, especially on Wasteland, is the the new Marksman DLC which has basically made Wasteland pay to win for those servers that allow the DLC weapons to spawn randomly in vehicles, though some don't so it isn't a HUGE issue. Â£11 for a few more guns? No thanks Bohemia, I'll stick to my trusty Mk18 and Lynx 12.7mm :D
1163	1	a	Well, Arma 3, Arma 3. Personally this is my favorite War game and maybe even my favorite war game of all time. Reason being is due ot it's heartbeating intense firefights. Espicially when you get along with some freinds and mods and completely make Arma into a full on Military Simulator. I honestly think Arma 3 campaign has a great story mode to it, every special part of the campaign made me want to not quit it! Intense scripting and story line for sure! Graphics wise, i think arma 3 has AMAZING graphics for a computer game, however the bad thing is you need a really buffed up computer to do it. Need a new graphics card/video card, and maybe even a new motherboard or CPU will help! Arma 3 multiplayer is OUTSTANDING, it's one of the best multiplayer communitys out there for it's great teamwork players and amazing gamemodes like Altis Life, Wasteland, and Invade And Annex! If you love battlefield, call of duty, or any other war FPS/realism war games this is the game for you and it's worth the money!
854	1	a	This game offers an experience like no other, although the learning curve is quite steep and boring. this game offers literally everything from RPG environments to hardcore milsim groups. if you like shooter games but you want a little more diversity and some more possibilities then this is a game for you!  My personal experiences with arma games could not be better, with a mature community and helpfull forums aswell as an awesome modding community, i have spent hundreds of hours playing everything from wasteland to missions with my friends, and editing/scripting missions.  what have I gained from this game?  +  awesome experiences  +  really good keyboard controll  +  basic scripting knowledge  +  Some fat  &lt;3    +  awesome friends  +  700+ hours of amazing fun!   10/10 do recommend!  
3451	1	a	This is by a wide margin my favorite game on steam. HOWEVER, IT IS NOT FOR THOSE WHO WHINE ABOUT CLUNKINESS AND POOR OPTIMIZATION. The clunkiness is what keeps this game down to earth and realistic and part of what makes this game great but it is not for some tastes. The optimization, yeah your not gonna get 60fps very often no matter your pc, it is still very very playable sitting fround 40-50 fps constant. Thsi is a military simulation sandbox which means the user created sontent is what makes it great. Check out the workshop for the best mods. I sugest battly royale, king of the hill, a3l, and exile.   Fantastic game 10/10 
5335	1	a	Very good game! And easy to play even for begingers! I totaly recommend this game!
3258	1	a	 http://www.twitch.tv/actabunnifoofoo 
5398	1	a	Its Fun especially Altis Life :D
1788	1	a	Gripes mainly on the fact that i still can't punch people or have a combat knife
448	1	a	Arma 3 is the best game ever! If you have ever played arma 2, you know that running into rocks was the worst! Wether in a car or on foot, the fatality rate was always 100%! But Wait theres more! If you get Arma 3, you can run into all the rocks you want! But be careful, someone decided there was an imbalance and so if you drive into a small chainlink fence, unlike in arma 2, your car has a 75% chance of exploding and a 100% chance of losing its wheels! Can't wait for Arma 4!
3565	1	a	Personal Rating: 9/10 Replayability: High Budget: Affordable - The price has dropped enough.  Length: It's mostly multiplayer - the singleplayer campaign is... Very difficult.   I was a fan of Operation Flashpoint - Dragon Rising and Red River, as well as Arma II.  I have to admit, the same problems that plagued Arma II still ravage Arma III to a degree.  It's unnecessarily difficult to set your keyboard up for this game.  They've certainly improved on it, now the keyboard mapping recognizes double tapping a button and even holding it, versus just pressing it.   That said, a lot of things in this game, could be handled through smart menus rather than having buttons for it.   It becomes impossible to remember where everything is toggled for.   That said, the game is without a doubt the greatest military simulator I've ever seen, and the AI is actually fairly smart (except for the friendly AI which appears to be stupid in comparison - but I mostly think it's because the friendly AI is subject to much more scripting than the enemy AI).   The inventory system is a welcome change from Arma II that had an incredibly complicated inventory system, and the fact that you can change everything from your uniform to your weapon mods is super great!   The game is, like I said, very difficult in single player, because the enemy can spot you before you can reasonably spot the enemy - but that isn't because the game is unrealistic, it's because it's pretty difficult to spot an enemy on a 28 inch monitor in 1080p, if there is a simulated distance of 500 meters between you, and the enemy is wearing camuflage.  This game will probably be a good thing to try with occulous rift once it comes out. It doesn't help that the enemy soldiers use camuflage that is actually much better suited for the terrain you play in, during the campaign - not that it matters the other way around, because I don't think the AI is set to differentiate between camu patterns.   There is no melee combat in the game, which was a bit of a bummer for me, but I don't think you would ever get a chance to use it anyway, because as I mentioned, you will often end up spotted by an enemy long before you're even able to notice that combat has started around you.   The game lacks an easy mode, where you stop to be wounded after bandaging your wounds and being out of combat for a while - Of course, that wouldn't be realistic, but it would still make the game a little less hardcore for those that find the difficulty a bit too steep.   In operation flashpoint, when you reached a checkpoint, your squad was revived, wounds were healed and new squad members even spawned with full ammo.   In Arma III, I find myself running out of ammo very quickly, I'm only capable of carrying one rifle (an option to carry a rifle instead of a secondary weapon, such as a rocket launcher, would be welcome), and if I get hit at any point - It's going to affect the rest of the mission, and missions are very very long.   This is a bit too brutal for my liking - it wouldn't matter in a multiplayer game, but in a single player campaign where the missions are so long that I often feel like I could make a full time job out of playing the game, it's too much.   That said, you can't ask for a more realistic military infantry simulator. It very accurately represents what it feels like to be in the infantry.   The producers should have put in some optional missions that were skippable, showing some of the less exciting parts of being in the armed forces, such as building a camp, weapon and gear maintenance, dealing with a complicated and sometimes not 100% efficient chain of command and the many menial duties of being a soldier.   It'd be cool if there was a 'I'm military' mode that could be activated, which results in you being assigned to a fire team in your unit, instead of basically being a joker.   The AI in your unit does operate like a military unit, with proper 'fire and movement' maneuvers, but you're left out of this, because the producer knew the player wasn't necessarily going to be able to keep up with that, but some players have it the other way around, they sit there, confused, wondering why you're not getting advancement orders, why your team is acting like they have orders, but they didn't reach you.   That said, I think that it's GOOD that they did it like they did, because this game is supposed to be for everyone, and not just for people with military experience, but it wouldn't have taken them that much longer to incorporate a mode like that.   With the verdict that sometimes, the realism level in this game makes it TOO difficult to play through a limited interface, such as keyboard+mouse and monitor, then I can really recommend this game to anyone who likes military simulators.   It's not your average run of the mill FPS game though, so if you like high-paced and less punishing gameplay, I recommend something like battlefield instead.  
4805	1	a	Absolutely marvelous piece of art.
2870	1	a	This is a great game and well worth the money spent. However, since I've been playing from the begining of the Alpha, it's not quite as fresh as I'd like.  Good on it's own, but far better with friends, a dedicated server, and some decent co-op missions.  The DLC is not worth mentioning, unfortunately.
110	1	a	My mates and I grouped up on a Wasteland server. We gathered around each other and tried to teach our newest member how to play. He'd press a button, ask what it did, we'd explain etc. We where almost done when I heard him say 'Hey guys what does G do?'. I was aware of a clanking sound towards my feet. Then it all clicked in one hilarious moment and I shouted 'GREEEEENAAADDEEEEEEEEE!' and dove towards the ground. Everyone else dove in various direcions except for one who dove on the grenade explaiming 'I'VE GOT IT!'. The only survivor was me and the lad who threw it so I spend a good minute patching everyone up.   So when teaching your mates to play, don't all stand in a circle.
825	1	a	Play it and get addicted
2574	1	a	11/10 I once got into a fight with a cow could not defeat him 2 strong 4 mi!
3345	1	a	most bad â¥â¥â¥ game ive ever played
2398	1	a	I have been playing this game for a couple of months and this game is worth it. Arma 3 has so much to do and I reccommend it.
5371	0	a	Awful. Way too complicated and clunky to be fun.
289	1	a	One of the best military games available. Its sandbox style and modding/customizations allow it to become almost anything you want. Co-operative military simulator, role-playing game, survival horror, you name it. It offers so many possibilities it has an endless replay value. What this game is to me is a military simulator, it has a numerous amount of upgrades from the previous Arma 2/Op. Arrowhead, most importantly the infantry handling and animations that now offer much more flexibility and greater control over your character. Vehicles none the less have been upgraded, the new PhysX 4 engine gives vehicles a much more realistic feeling. Lights and scenario rendering have been not only upgraded, but made even LIGHTER for your pc to run, as opposed to the incredibly heavy Arma 2 engine that would put an incredible amount of stress even to the most high-end gaming rigs. The downside however is that as of now the game doesn't offer much sandbox content as in vehicles and weapons but the developers have already announced future free DLCs that would address this and add some other cool features.  In conclusion i think this game offers infinite possibilities to those who can take advantage of them but it still needs some time to grow and reach its full potential, what we'll have then will be a game that is going to put to shame all the other commercial FPSs.
5369	0	a	so good to install and unninstal! plz try  
4085	1	a	Arma 3 is a very nice game,well developed and supported by creators from all around the world who keep making mods,missions and all that kind of stuffs that improve the quality of the game and increase its lifetime...sadly it's a bit bugged sometimes and it lacks some key features like jumping and climbing(which can be introduced by mods),but overall it's a good game and it's worth the money, and i can't wait to see how arma 4 will look like!!
913	1	a	This game is great combines between FPS and simulation, in a realistic environments it got everything a game needs, starting with the amazing graphics, sounds, ambient effects, everything gameplay is great, &amp; steam workshop got some of the best mods you'll ever imagine, great game, a must have.
1143	1	a	With only 168.4 hours played I would have to say that Arma 3 is one of the best military shooters I have ever played in my entire life. Love playing steam games with friends and want a military shooter this is the absolute game for you. Arma 3 has an amazing community and amazing addons to go with it like Battle Royale, Epoch, Breaking point and many other addons that make the game endless fun for you and your friends.
1402	1	a	I recommend this game only if my brother, Tommy plays it. :)
4811	1	a	arma 3 is buggy but very fun with friends scenarios great every thing is beautiful couldnt reccomend it any higher
154	1	a	THE GOOD -------------------- This game is actually the 4th installment of the Arma series and I've been playing since the start. The developers of this game have taken a rare approach to updating their game. They keep the mechanics and feel of the game pretty much the same while making the graphics shine by just updating their custom Real Virtuality engine rather than replacing it, as well as adding new campaigns, missions, vehicles, weapons, and game modes.  The part where this game REALLY shines, however, is the community driven mods. The game was built for modding and the developers have done everything in their power to make it easy for the community to make ANYTHING they want out of this game. It may look like a hardcore military simulator from the store page, but I've seen games in this series turned into a civil war sims, 'grand theft auto' like games (Arma Life), hardcore zombie games (DayZ), a StarGate tribute which had working, animated stargates and all your favorite characters from the show, ww2 sims (Invasion 1944), Jurassic Park tributes, and so much more.  These mods take a lot of work to create, sure, but there are also things you can do very easily without any knowledge of 3d editing or texturing. Simply open the mission editor on the map that you like best and place a few soldiers down. Now add some waypoints for them to attack a town. Add some soldiers inside the town. That's it! If you make yourself a civilian character in the town you can watch a fantastic battle ensue between the two groups of soldiers, using proper flanking maneuvers and yelling back and forth to one another when they see an enemy. This all would take at most about 2 minutes in the editor to have a full battle going on. Want to do more? Read the plethora of information out there on advanced editing and scripting in the game and before you know it you'll have the ability to make suicide bombers, 'battle busses' (essentially a civilian bus with artillery and machine guns on top of it), nuclear bombs, and really ANYTHING you can imagine. If you have any issues, someone will be willing to help you out either on  reddit.com/r/armadev  or on the official Bohemia Interactive forums.  I hope you'll choose to join me on my favorite game and play some cool missions together that you or I just freshly made in the editor! Even if you don't like making your own content, there are fun mods already out there such as the popular Battle Royale mod where you're forced to parachute out of a crashing plane with 28 or so of your fellow players and fight to the death while scavenging for the best gear. Just look around and you'll find endless entertainment in this game!   THE BAD --------------- I mentioned that the engine is updated with each iteration instead of replaced. This does sometimes mean that glitches that were in the first couple games reappear in later games, but with the increased popularity of the series lately the devs have been doing their best to squash all those nasty bugs. Another warning I would give would-be buyers is that the game is very demanding for your PC. People who have rigs that they THINK are powerful because they can play Battlefield 4 at full settings without much frame drop are in for a nasty surprise: Arma 3 truly stresses your hardware and the devs are still working on optimizations to take full advantage of your hardware. At the moment it seems like most people are having a smooth experience but some peoples' hardware, even when pretty impressive, just doesn't get along with the game that well at the moment.
4858	1	a	THEYRE GONNA RELEASE THIS GAME WITH 64BIT EXECUTABLES HOLY â¥â¥â¥â¥
2596	1	a	just noticed i had never written a comment down here so let's write.  so i'll good points bad points.  good ones:  It's an arma game. It was made by bohemia interactive. there are guns. God damn CHOPPERS Dev care about the community The community is freaking good, well... most of the time DLC don't penalyze anyone and the features of these are free  Dev still add new things (for instance DLC marksmen tomorrow adding working bipods, resting on objects, new guns and all this kind of â¥â¥â¥â¥), they're currently working on a new map, they'll surely add many unknown things.  The freacking mods, i mean in this game if you want a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing private jet riding a horse with a sword there's probably someone who made it and if not you can do it yourself (it's a long â¥â¥â¥ work but you can).  now bad points:  Physics you make a vehicle explode by driving 3mph towards a rock but you won't explode if you make a 180 landing on a spruce tree from a god damn ac-130 which comes from a mod...  Some people in the community especially the ones who complains about DLC's that add free content..  Not enough planes, there are several choppers civilians and military but there are only fighter jets and drones as fixed-wings.  And finally hellicopter advanced physics which is some kind of weird crossing between the arma 3 style and some kind of reallistic but not too much physics, i find it pretty weird but meh..   So buy this game, this was an order ;)
3939	1	a	Very cool game, love the campaign and the mods avaialble are limitless.
3339	1	a	Almost 2 years later, still 60 dollars.   0/60 dollars left in my wallet 
1528	1	a	What's not to like about a true military tachtical First Person Shooter. ARMA 3 delivers a excellent game that does just that. This is not your typical run around killing spree like most FPS games lead people to beleive. With it's extensive maps, ARMA 3 gives gamers a vast variety of landscapes, dynamic scenery including day to night trasistions. In ARMA 3 you need to slow it down and take your time or your self dead with no chance to respawn. NO RESPAWN? that's right, realism is a real as it gets. But don't worry, respawns can and do exist. But sometimes it's better to wait for a medic, if one is available. Trust me when I tell you that ARMA 3 is as real as it can get.
477	1	a	I 10000% recomend this game.
400	1	a	After 1100 hours I think I can finally write a review on this game. Don't expect 60fps. Pros Best vanilla ballistics for a shooter Best modding community I've ever seen 12 different stances, useful for firing while in cover Supports TrackIR Variety of game modes 10,000x better community than CSGO, battlefield, or COD Bullets hurt Helicopters can still fly despite severe damage, autorotations often required  Cons Even a supercomputer wouldn't get more than 55 FPS Overly sensitive admins on some servers Need quality headset 6 of your steam friends will want this game Adding some mods may prove a challenge
4610	1	a	2014 Best Military Simulator available for the general public. make sure you try out the mod, King Of The Hill (KOTH) 
4694	0	a	Game performance is far too horrible to even play this game past the introduction. You want to look at all the benchmarks online before you decide to buy this. 
3817	1	a	30 out of 30 fps
2073	1	a	Got it for Altis life stayed for King of the Hill.
2316	1	a	i am a MASSIVE fan of all arma games and i can say after a dodgy release bohemia interactive have eventually have brought this game to close perfection and with visuals like this, i am hooked. if you are new to arma i recommend starting here, it gives you clear instructions and a smooth campaign (thats if you can run it). it has nice, mature, loyal and welcoming community (with the occasional your mum joke) that does not hesitate to mod and create user made missions, so boredom is rare. i highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a deeper fps experience.
2636	1	a	I would totally recommend this game for those who have the money :P
2037	1	a	Amazing game. Exile and battle royal and other multiplayer games are a ton of fun.
1913	1	a	Don't expect much from the campaign. But wow, if you have a good PC, the multiplayer and mods (like Arma 2 did) will quite possibly change the way you look at video games.
2096	1	a	One of the most fun games out in the steam store. There's so much variety that inlcudes mods and different gamemodes. Even though simulator games are not your type you can still find a place in Arma. You can play gamemodes ranging from all of the Life mods (Altis Life, Arma 3 Life, etc), King of the Hill, Domination (coop Players vs. AI), Wasteland, Epoch, Exile, Breaking Point, Battle Royale, and many more. Those are just multiplayers mods and gamemodes you can play, there is also a huge variety of mods and missions available in the workshop that you can download and play nonstop. All of this available in huge maps, such as Altis that is around 260 sq km.  Every day, whatever you play, you will always experience something new. Be it either encountering a Wipeout for the first time, getting Allahu Akbar'd at Kavala Square in Altis Life, robbing a bank, being the most powerful group in a Wasteland server, meeting random people and start chaos around Altis, etc. There are just so many things you can do in Arma, the possibilities might be endless. I really recommend this game for anyone who is looking to have a unique experience. One thing though, playing with other people together in a group or clan is 1000 times more recommendable to get the most out of the experience.   First Experiences in Altis Life: -Spawn in Kavala -No gear, only hello kitty clothes -Walk in the street -Spot a offroad piled with rebels shooting in the air being chased by 10 police cars -Walk into Kavala Square -Find half the server there (around 40 people) -Police don't know how to control the crowd -People jumping off buildings demanding money -Circle of guys smoking week with Bob Marley music -Sudden shout of 'ALLAHU AKBAR' -The whole Kavala Square gets leveled -Everyone dies -Spawn again -Offroad pulls up, guy says to take a gun -Grab gun from the offroad with 5 other people -Do a 10 min stealth mission around Kavala to avoid cops with the 5 guys -Plan out a robbery -PUT YOUR HANDS UP -Turns out to be an officer -Turns around, spam tazes -Restrained -Go to jail for 15 minutes -10/10 would Altis Life again
3719	1	a	This is The best Realistic military game u ever can get! it got so damn much!!! And it is so fun to play with friends, dont matter what game style u have, u can play in a clan Or u can play with friends and just bombing towns! :D
2547	1	a	Fun game and many different game modes. WARNING: BEFORE BUYING Make sure your Computer/Laptop have the right specs for running this game.
332	1	a	AHHH, i love this game :)
1411	1	a	this is an awesome game very fun to play with friends,great graphics, worth the price
367	0	a	Despite many warnings from the community, bohemia decided to do the right thing and shove their thumb up their butts and not work off of a decent engine, again. Thus resulting in 90 FPS in single player, down to 10 - 15 in multiplayer, servers can't even handle all the scripts that their idiotic owners apply to said server, resulting in massive jam to be applied on your end of the game. Instead of fixing the AI, glitches and trying to optimize the game, bohemia has decided to pump out new content that adds to the previous issues stated above. What's that? You want single player? Oh well you'll have to wait for them to finish pumping out those SP episodes, why yes they are free, as they should be, as you have just paid for a $60 dollar alpha.  Oh and the only thing people play in this 'realistic army sim' is a god damn RPG average civi game type where you role play YOUR ACTUAL BORING LIFE.
5346	0	a	This game is totaly waste of money for amd owners.  Getting too low fps with poor cpu - gpu usage.   Fps around 15-30 with high settings and it's dramaticly same with low settings too.  Not optimized for amd cpu - apu.  Totaly unplayable for amd owners.  I opened a ticket on steam cs for refund my money.
2445	1	a	Best war simulator
1123	1	a	it's good
2207	1	a	This Game keeps me playing till the end of days.
3245	1	a	Very Recommended game by youtubers and gamers
462	1	a	well guess ill never get 2015 back...
1276	0	a	ArmA III could have, and still could be, a great game. It is only set back by few things.  Pro-  Great Graphics- It looks amazing, and even makes old maps look better then they did in ArmA II Stance System- Now you no longer have to go prone if your head was sticking out a bit PhysX- You no longer get the really wonky physics that appeared in ArmA II Ragdoll- Running over people is now a LOT more fun!  Con- (spoiler, theres more than the Pro) Awful Performance- They said that any computer that could play ArmA II could play ArmA III, they never said at a playable framerate Inventory- I still dont understand it, I mean you had ArmA II weird UI, now you have a even weirder drag-and-drop UI (Just use DayZ SA inventory, its fast and makes a load of sense) Dreadful Netcode- Still running ArmA crappy netcode, now with every server at 200 ping Missing Content- The game only has planes and transport helicoptors for Indies, not Blu or OP, so it makes missions on either end really wierd with green helis (Yes, there is mods that add planes, but you shouldn't rely on the modding community to finish your game for you)  In all ArmA 3 is a sad avoid, DayZ standalone is still doing better in its alpha than ArmA 3 did in its. It could get better as the stupid 'Free DLC' thing goes on, but a spin-off team working on a zombie game did better then BI's main team. It's just kinda insaulting
4692	1	a	why is this game still $59.99
3062	1	a	This game is amazing you must get it
2378	1	a	Brandon is silly for not buying this game. It's a fun game. You can go diving, who doesnt want to go diving.
2289	1	a	it is just so awesome
3496	1	a	Arma 3 is a outstanding game with such immersive gameplay and nice controls that feel right at home. The game also has a nice VR Training mode to start learning about its mechanics and controls about the game.  Arma 3 is also the best way to get a PTSD within 5 minutes of gameplay
2133	1	a	best military game ever
4043	1	a	When I started my first mission in coop I ended up dieing in the first few seconds. Little did I know how to fly a helicopter but I wasn't going to have anyone hold me back! took down 10 guys..not sure if they were on my team. 10/10
1000	1	a	All around a good game, I would highly reccomend it to anyone who likes FPS games.
624	1	a	bought this game 1 year ago afther i build my own game pc one of the best games i have ever purchased  there are so many diffrent mods you can have fun in like the all new overpoch from arma 2 now in arma 3 :D  wasteland,battleroyale and all the hours of playing altis life and being a good civi or a cold blooded criminal  the wrokshop is a good place to find some awesome singleplayer mission or co-op missions to do with your friends  still love this game afther 1 year 10/10
4555	1	a	Military simulation at its best. If you want to try something different other than arcade COD/BF, definitely give this a try.
3188	1	a	still a bit buggy, but a lot of fun though.
3815	1	a	I have missed many life events because of this game.......not even mad
3020	1	a	the best game i have everplay for this played 2000 hours  
1246	1	a	This game is the best war simulator you can get on steam, it cost alot, but it's worth it. Spend 100 hours in this game, enjoyed every single minute.  Recommended mods for this amazing game:  Breaking point(Kinda fun) Battle Royale(Most intensive â¥â¥â¥â¥ ever) Epoch(Same as Breaking point, but with building, so it's abit better.) Arma3Life(Best roleplay, alot of new cars, guns. Well it was fun atleast, when it was closed beta now it's kinda shity.)
80	1	a	-go into mp co-op server -bunch of wild old men yelling -'delta 2 4 9er we need cas at coordinates 230914' -i dont know who delta249er is -i get scared -begin shooting -accidentally kill 8 bad guys -people say i did 'good â¥â¥â¥â¥' -get awarded medal -quit game  2/10 needs more goats
1136	1	a	one of the best gaems
584	1	a	If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.  Ingredients: 1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie   Directions: 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.  Eat.
1974	1	a	This is a very good game.
3418	1	a	Rappelled from a chinook with my mates. Last guy caused the chopper to explode.  10/10
4391	1	a	This game will make you lick your own lobster!
1844	1	a	Arma 3 is awesome.. the end :)
4136	1	a	So immersive when played in multiplayer with a proper team. Map reading is just one of the real life skills you may need to use during battle, as well as using the radio and communicating with your team. Also includes a great editor to make your own missions for multiplayer and singleplayer, and you can upload your own missions to the Steam Workshop
4175	1	a	Man This Game Is Amazing. The Physics In This Game Is Incredible If You Shoot Someone It Actually Shows Bullet Hole, If You Blow Up Building It Fall And Tumbles, On In-packed Of The Building Dust Bursts Out Like a Cloud.  Now Time To Mention Role-Play If Your a Person That Enjoys Role Playing i Recommend Joining The Role Play Servers.  Okay Time To Mention My Favourite Game mode Wastleland If Your a Person That Enjoys, Roaming Around Doing Missions Killing People Flying Jets Blowing Up Thing, Then Wasteland Is The Way To Go.  There Are Way More Game Modes Like Invade Annex, King Of The Hill And Even Exile But To Get Exile You WIll Need To Download it.  Over All This Game Is Fantastic If you Enjoy Any Of Those Things i Mentioned Above^ Then You Will Enjoy Arma 3 My Rating: 9/10
1099	1	a	Simulation isn't the defining aspect of Arma. It's scale!  Arma IIIâs complexity is a double-edged sword. It takes a long time to comprehend, but once youâre comfortable enough with its mechanics to take advantage of them under pressure, youâre able to engage in a kind of large-scale tactical combat thatâs simply not offered elsewhere. Weak sound and a sparsely decorated map are forgivable, making Arma IIIâs nearly endless content definitely worth experiencing as long as you know thereâs a long, dark tunnel to get through before you can see the light.
5024	1	a	very fun but cam be a very low fps game
3071	1	a	Great game.
4984	1	a	Very good game if you like to rolepay.
4546	1	a	It's aight
1892	1	a	LOVE IT!
4812	1	a	Huge open world sandbox. Multiplayer desyncs a lot, too many kill trades online. The content is created by users, so there is not that many good missions or multiplayer modes. Theres is about 3 Main modes that people play; King of The Hill, Wasteland and Altis Life.  This is still a great buy and many people are working on creating new missions and improving current missions.   Warning: There appears to be a high number of squeaky kids considering how kids usually are into more casual games. Must be all the Day Z fuzz arma has gotten into.

1300	1	a	Very interesting and realistic game.  9/10
4239	1	a	best war simulation game ever
4569	1	a	got one word for y'll 'epic'
1130	1	a	This Game Wasn't For me But however it seems like a good game and it's Optimized greatly.
3070	1	a	Best of it's kind! Still a bit buggy but great fun and everything is possible! :D
2452	1	a	Huge Map Awesome Graphics Only in Arma moments  Not recommended for those that want a fast paced shooter or dont have a reasonable PC  Sweet game Thumbs up :)
5185	1	a	If you plan on buying this game. Make sure you have a GPU better then an AMD Radeon 7750 1GBDDR5. Because thats what I have and I CANNOT go higher then standard settings. And on standard I'm getting 27-30 FPS. Kind of sad that this game alone cost gamers $8 Million in computer upgrades. THIS GAME ALONE.  PC SPECS  i7-2600 @3.40GHz AMD Radeon 7750 1GBDDR5 64 bit Windows 7 8GB DDR3 ram Quad Core 
4158	0	a	I wish i could both recommend and not recommend... but ultimately, i hate it.. it has such potential... if you like single player shooters, this game is pretty good. the campaign is pretty neat.. that's about it.. i got this game cause i prefer sims, over arcadey type games (CoD)... and the sim level is there... the problems start at online play. you need to be a member of a secret society, to actually get any war play going on online. and neither have the desire for that, nor the time or dedication.. this was evident almost immediately. all the online servers are really stupid GTA meets 2nd life meets the sims mod crap. its insanely stupid and boring.. unless you hunt down some online community of people who actually want to play a war game, you wont get that online from this game.. no official servers or official game modes (that i could find).. its highly annoying.. within an hour i wanted a refund, but at the time i had a baby, and he started crying and i left the game open, and it went past the 2 hour limit (5hours it claimed) i repeatedly email steam, trying to explain the situation, and all i got was the same auto response... a complete waste of money.. so i uninstalled... then with news stirring that it was going to get a dx12 update, i thought i would give another shot since i was stuck with this piece of crap anyway.. multiplayer is still absolute garbage if you don;t want to be active in a community.. so i played the campaign, it was ok till the second chapter, where the first mission is solo stealth with no guns garbage, and i lost interest again... up until that point, it was enjoyable.. about a 7 out of 10..   i dunno.. mixed emotions.. if you want to play a slower more boring versions of gta online with better physics.. this might be your game.. if you want to deal with online forums and locked private servers to get a battle in, this might be your game...if you like single player campaigns, might be your game.. if you like, single player target practice, might be your game.. it has all the potential in the world... with absolutely no delivery to anyone who just wants to hop into a battle and shoot.. (wasn't expecting a run and gun, but i was expecting to play a war game, not a run around grinding gold with stupid rules and having to have a job rpg) i would say avoid it.. i tried so hard to get a refund, but steam sucks, and i couldn't even get a real response from a human being.. now im stuck with this useless single player game.. i keep trying to force myself to find something fun to do with it, and it can't be done... on the other hand technically and graphically it;s amazing and the attention to details is great... it was just squandered on a community with terrible terrible terrible ideas on how it should be played... the addition of official servers wih official game modes, would make this game a 10 out of 10... until then, its like a 2.. unless you like pretending to be an under paid truck driver that gets harrasse by lame people who think they are digital police..  i personally wish i never spent a dime on this game...
3529	1	a	took a mortar launcher to space  10/10

4761	1	a	Its ok.
302	1	a	At first I was very skeptical about Arma III. Playing Arma II was not such a pleasant experience, and I was very happy that I haven't wasted my money on this when the Day Z mod came out, So I bought Arma III expecting something as bad as the previous Arma. But I was surprised. The graphics, movement, squad management, driving and many other features were massively improved. I`m not even talking about shooting. Recoil and gun damage is so realistic. But the inventory system probably is the most improved thing since Arma II. Now you can easily see whats on the ground, or in the vehicle, or simply add attachments for your gun ( which are awesome! ). There`s no more arrow clicking and usual inventory lag. The only things that needs fixing are glitches and AI. Glitches should be fixed in future patches, but the AI need some work done. The AI could be both very easy to take down and extremely punishing at the same time. Sometimes AI just stands there for couple of seconds and then starts shooting, or instantly spots you and shoots you down in a few shots. I think Bohemia Interactive should really focus on this problem, because its not so serious as it is irritating, All in all, if you want some new experience of shooting game that requests some planing, patience and cooperation instead of 'being your own little Rambo', you definitely should check out Arma III.
461	1	a	I am a arma veteran and by far it is the game i play most and i cant wait foe the tanoa update with new weapons and vehicles . keep the good work up bohemia
4373	1	a	Amazing game with so many different ways to play.  You can be a part of a tactical realism squad.  You can just play king of the hill for fast paced action.  There are lots of mods that you can play like battle royale and breaking point.  Only bad point is the multiplayer can run badly.
2565	1	a	Great Game. It is not a 'just shoot' shooter, no this game has some very advanced mechanisms which bring this game up to a new stage of depth. Certainly worth the money
1607	1	a	Amazing game. Try Stratis wasteland, Altis life, or domination; they're the best game types.
2732	1	a	Greatest game ever!!! The best by fare simulation game. All trhe games from Arma all the way up to Arma III are top notch and have more game play in the form of mods to last a lifetime.  This is my got to get listed game! So go get it.
4497	1	a	I dont own the game but i can write a review :3  Now I DO own the game and I can say it's amazing :)
3730	1	a	This is a great game with tons of mods to keep u going forever. Some people complain about the DLC and it being to pricy but this game is like BF,COD,GTA,H1Z1,DayZ,RTS combined and if u put those titles alone together wich will give u less play hours ull be spending allot more money on those even if u bought the entire Arma 3 collection at full price.  Totally worth the money. And if its on sale. 100% must buy.
1420	1	a	its the best game ever i want all to buy it
2035	1	a	Love this game but have to make a new steam and buy another because it said i hacked so now I cant play multiplayer
3805	1	a	This is maybe the best war simulator out there you should try it though the multiplayer requires a lot of DLC but it is worth its money when you 'can' get into a server its fun as hell and the campagin THE BEST THING EVER, anyway this is what I think arma 3 is like and I think you should get it I would recommend this too my friends and everyone.
4864	1	a	Played it a litle it wasn't bad
5096	0	a	meh.  i have a couple of issues with the game.  1. you need a fantastic cpu and decent gpu to handle this game. otherwise, you will be constantly playing at 20 fps 2. for how much processing they take up, the ai is downright stupid. they are still too slow and hardly use enough cover to blend in with players. -to make up for difficulty, the ai is incredibly accurate and good at detecting. 3. the vanilla campaigns are set so your teams are at poor odds with the ai. this is supposed to be realistic, where real world tactics are used. why is my team running into an enemy town through a valley? 4. the armor system is awful. it takes 5-6 shots to kill with the medium caliber assault rifles. i know they say its because of plate carriers. plates don't necessarily stop bullets, they take a lot of energy out of them so you don't die immediately. getting shot is still going to put you out of a fight. anything past .243 or 6.5 is going to start breaking bones; it would be amazing if you could even still move on your own let alone shoot back accurately. 5. the campaign is mediocre with missions that take too long and put too much responsiblity on the player trying to have fun. arma2 also had bad voice actors with bad lines, but this is a little better. its stilll not much of an improvement.  6.wonky user interface. this have improved on a lot over time, and there are mods to make it more intuitive. it still takes a while to do anything in your inventory though; maybe because in real life, it would take time to rummage through your pockets and ruck sack to find anything. it still sucks though 7. no tutorial. yes i know there is a 'boot camp' thing now. that hardly explains how to use anything. it still missed subjects like actual fighting, flying helicopters and jets, taking cover.  8. mission editor. how do you use it? i don't really know. ive been messing with it for years, i still dont think i know much about how it all works. 9. multiplayer. it doesnt happen. at least from what ive seen. just about all the servers are locked clan servers, or empty public matches. the server browser is cluttered and confusing with no explanation of what it all means. i mean call of duty was so successful partly because of its join a random lobby feature.  i know i mentioned all the bad stuff. there is much good to this game, and im sure other reviewers will point it out. i played this game franchise until i got sick of it. now i play insurgency because its much more fluid and refined with the same idea of critical dammage and little hud.
3523	1	a	Joined altis life, got ran over by some dude who was singing. 10/10
2119	1	a	First 5 minutes of online multiplayer I was killed by stairs. Chased by a drone on epoch and forgot about fall damage and died by jumping off a 2 story house.
1525	1	a	This game will redefine 'Easy' as 'Hard'.  But it's also â¥â¥â¥â¥ing awesome, and has some baller mods and great devs.
515	1	a	Alright now, Been seeing alot of whining about the game is not optimized and that â¥â¥â¥â¥, YOU have to consider, this is no Lightweight game, this game will run havoc on your CPU if you don't have a strong CPU, this is a Simulator game top tier of its class, you cannot expect to run on full Ultra 60 FPS with loads of mods and scripts in certain missions, This is an extremely demanding game, It's very hard to optimize this kind of games, This is not Battlefield Hardlines in a Sandbox styled gameplay, This game is running on one of the worlds most demaning CPU, GPU and RAM engine's. And a 3-4 year old AMD CPU ain't gonna get you really far in this game, There alot of point's and factors here and there. This is just simply a demanding game ashell, Well enough about that.  This game is extremely fun and good to play, You have lots of mods and tools you can use and play in this game. This game is definently an improvment since Arma 2 (And Arma 2 Is EVEN WORSE Optimized). I really can't tell and I really won't or care to tell much about the game in all aspects but I can give a short brief idea of the game. This is a Military Simulation game kinda, It is an open world driven game, this game also has a Mission Editor ready for use, you can make missions and campaigns and whatever (aslong as you know how ;D ) Game is fairly fun and there alot of servers with different tons of game modes like Altis Life, Domination, Capture The Island, King of the Hill, Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch and so on. the game includes 3 Campaign Episodes that are quite interesting to play. Bohemia Interactive does a great job supporting the game and updating it. oh by the way. there exists a Zeus Player, Well there are some missions that includes Zeus, Zeus is a entity that a player can be. the Zeus function in the sense that you can make missions in real time while everyone is playing on the server, The Zeus can choose either to help or oppose the other players, by spawning in enemies or smite them with lighting strikes and so on. You can also use the Zeus in the Editor. All in all this game is definently worth the money, IF your PC can run it properly. K thx bye!
1666	1	a	Got on a chopper  Jumped from a chopper Got shot shot before i hit the floor  10/10 Would chopper again
3376	1	a	ArmA 3 is a really great game if you have the patience for it. There are many game modes and it is a lot of fun with friends. I highly reccomend this game to anyone that hasn't played it yet.
4166	1	a	I eat â¥â¥â¥
4847	1	a	This game has one of the most powerful graphics that has been seen in any game so far in a fps and survival etc game. No screen tearing, Hardly any graphics problems on terrain or sky etc.  This game is a 9.5/10 game, and will beat the bf4 and cod series if the developers concentrate on this game for the long term run. 
4509	0	a	No tutorial and no easy way to figure out how to play this game. A case of trying to make a simulator but not realizing it still needs to be a fun game. Not fun at all.
1861	1	a	Arma is LIFE!
3557	1	a	The best MIl-Sim game on the market
5329	0	a	Extreme lag needs optimization, would not recommend to anyone that can only run minecraft on their computer like me
2704	1	a	The best game I have ever played , its just so addicting &amp; emersive , the game may run bad but for all the content you get &amp; map size its hella worth it , but for me the game runs decent as I have an Intel proccessor . The graphics today still look good , and the zues editor is the best part in my opinion as you can create random events while playing with your friends which adds a whole new feel to arma , look I can go on &amp; on about how good this game is , but here is a 10/10 arma , u deserve it :)
415	1	a	It may have it's flaws, but it is a fantastic military sim, especially when played on multiplayer.
3017	1	a	This is the most epic fps and third person shooter game i have played defently worth getting
1452	1	a	I've always been a fan of the Arma series, right the way back to Cold War Assault.  Arma 3 is a brilliant step forward, and there are some good improvements since Arma 2, which I was very happy with. I am able to play this on my laptop (HP Pavilion g6, Intel Core i3) and the graphics are very good. I would like to upgrade to be able to enjoy the higher end graphics. However this game is still incredibility realistic.  Overall, very enjoyable, very realistic, and lots of fun!
3825	1	a	It's the â¥â¥â¥â¥.
903	1	a	Worth every penny, This is a combat millitary game with gorgues massive battlefields. Every inch of this game amazing from the Sea combat to Air Combat. I, Lorddwarvin Recommend this game ! Buy this game now!
715	1	a	Fantastic game! Plenty of action and 'moments' - even better if you're playing with friends!  However, if you're a hardcore Call of Duty fan who enjoys fast paced first person shooters - highly not recommended. But if you're looking for a different challenge, then definitely worth a shot!
5280	1	a	I didn't know I even own this game
5316	1	a	pretty good, but very laggy for my pc, ill buy the full version once i buy myself a super computer
1345	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH
4938	1	a	Great game! Though, I do recommend to someone that is considering buying this game to have a 'somewhat decent' PC to play it. It's no fun playing a shooting game when you can barely even shoot accurately due to having bad performance!
1790	1	a	The game is very entertaining, and there is quite a bit of content to choose from with all of the mods available for the game. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys FPSs, although this isn't your normal FPS and you should look into the gameplay a bit before you just jump in, as it took me quite awhile to get used to the controls.  I do find it difficult to get more than 30FPS in this game with a 980TI and an i7 3930k, but I play on a 4K resolution monitor so that plays a big part, and your results may vary, just understand that your frames may vary depending on hardware, and server as well.
1096	0	a	Poorly Optimised
2742	1	a	Very good game to all military lovers
3549	1	a	arma is probably one of the best allround millsims there are to date and everyone loves it. this games puts you through highs and low, tough and easy times, sad, happy, angry and probably one of the best loving and most best game every
211	0	a	If you are an Arma fan, this game will change all that.  When you spen 60$ and your computer can't run it, It will be because your computer is crappy. When you are disappointed in the complete lack of content compared to other Arma games, you will be called spoiled. When there is nothing to do offline, no point or story it's because it's still in the works even though it's a full release. When you can't eek out better than 10FPS no matter what your specs, it's because you didn't tweak enough. When you can't find a server to play on it's because you don't know the right clan. When you do get on a server and it lags, greifs and glitches, it's because you play on crappy servers. When you don't think it's realistic, it's not a sim.  When you cant have any shoot'em up fun like BF it's because it is a sim. When all your other games run like a champ and are fun but not Arma3, it's not fair to compare. When you voice any of the above views here or the BI Forums you are a liar.  http://forums.bistudio.com/showthread.php?163875-I-am-a-player-of-BI-games-from-OFP-CWC-Heres-what-I-think 
20	1	a	My opinion on every AOE is almost the same. I absolutely love these types of games. I enjoy building and training a growing army then completely smashing everyone else (unless they are better than me huhuhuhu) but honestly AOE III is a bit graphic outdated now but itâs still an amazing game for it being released in 2005.   Recommendation: Absolutely. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys strategy games and won't mind a bit less graphics then the newer games.
1949	1	a	the game is ok.
278	1	a	One of my favorite games on steam, from Arma 1 until now, money well spent.
4080	1	a	Ive spent way too long playing this game, but i can say its the best game ive played. Playing this game has made 95% of my steam friends and that may be from mil-sim servers to life servers and survival servers. This game always has something for you to do. I 100% recomend it and also the DLC's as they just make the game even more fun! so see you in game!
2533	1	a	Its ok.
484	1	a	Awesome, just awesome, with a huge load of bugs :D  If you like military simulations you gonna have a lot of fun.
3330	1	a	It reminds me of games with guns. It is a good game with guns.
2739	1	a	itsamust have for PRO gamers!
3888	1	a	Helped me get alot of friends and has so many options on how to play thanks to mods and the editor. Virtually infinite possibilities with superb physics (sometimes) and graphics. Also has a fantastic community and great developers. The only thing that bothers me is the poor optimization on large servers. Above 50-60 people and fps takes a dive. Overall a great game and would definitely buy it again if I didn't have it.
3469	1	a	This game is intensely fun, and has some very intricate mods that allow you to get more immersed in whichever style of fps gameplay you like. From Strategic Warfare, to COD-style run and gun.
4104	1	a	I love this game, and after playing arma 2 this game was just a whole new world. This game might not have the same guns, which is a little bit of a let down but there are some new ones and many different mods to add the arma 2 guns back into the game. If you didn't like the stupid animations from arma 2 this game is alot better, like an actual reload animation, although it might be the same for about 10 guns or so nonetheless there is an animation. The DayZ universe has quite widened with the Exile and Epoch mods, new maps and other things, and honestly Arma 3 is the best arma made so far in terms of Realism. The leaning ability has also expanded, with a stance for shooting under cars, and one on your a$$ that looks like a dog scratching with worms. and many other things arma 2 could've used. Best $75 Ive ever spent, and I bought arma 2 for $6! If your fresh to the game series make sure you have a friend who can mentor your noobyness until you can become a pro arma-er, you will definetly need to especialy with Flying.
4956	1	a	For the little I played, this is definitive game for military simulation lovers.   It has some bugs, but the game is great and offers TONS of customizations and options to make it your own. A word of advice: You will never learn what is to play Arma if you are alone. So get an unit, soldier!  10/10
5194	1	a	Better than No Man's Sky
4949	1	a	if you seek a big community this game is not for you. 6000+ Servers with about 500 players online a day, scattered around. Give or take 50 to 100 people. So you have 5000+ Dead servers up with 0 players. Game probably use to be active, now the community is dead.  I would not recommend this game if you seek company. If you like playing by yourself, i recommend this game.
1092	1	a	I've ran more miles in this game than I have in real life.
197	1	a	I don't even own this game but i can review it 10/10  EDIT: Now i do own the game, and i would say it is a fun and realistic shooter, with a great modding community Still 10/10
1119	1	a	This game is horribly unoptimized, very buggy, and just plain doesn't work sometimes. Most MP servers are garbage and lag like hell, the single player campain isn't very good, and the vanilla game isn't worth anything near 60$.  Think of Arma 3 as a foundation for things to be built on top of. This game gets SO much better with mods and other addons.  This game is without a doubt the best military simulator out right now, and it gets many times better if you play with a group of people.  It has pretty much infinite replayability and more things to do than you'll ever be able to. It just has so much to offer and experience. I've found that playing with a group of people in Arma 3 is an amazing experience that no other shooter can offer.   Arma 3 really is the ultimate sandbox in which the possibilites are endless.   If you can overlook it's flaws and get over them, you'll find Arma 3 to be one of the best games you've ever played.
3121	1	a	I went online, ended up in a Go-Kart with a HMG on top, and then getting a nuke and exploding everywhere from hitting a small rock with a gokart.   10/10 GOTAY
2221	1	a	if this were a coloring book it would be an alright coloring book.
3319	1	a	I don't even own this game. lel
3797	1	a	Probably the best shooter out there. Loads of things are possible within the game. A lot of gamemodes, for example roleplay games.
323	1	a	Love it, woukd recommend anyday, so much possibility its unreal
4913	1	a	Beautiful graphics, massive scale (terrain is huge and PLENTY of weapons and vehicles to use). The game has a growing mod support, gametypes like Wastland, Battle Royale, King of the Hill and Domination gives the game a big lifespan, where boredom is a hard thing to find. The requirements are a bit demanding, but with an old phenom processor and GTX 660, I run the game fine.
1778	1	a	Arma is the sh!t! Hands down! Boo hoo if you can't run it... Go upgrade and STFU!
2888	1	a	This game is amazing I only have a few hours in it but IM IN LOVE !!!
1727	1	a	I highly recommend Arma 3 really great production for pc games I played this game 160 hours , and I still want to play it
1663	1	a	Terrific graphics for the people who have the system requirements, ((underneath the game-page)) - incredible military multiplayer experience that offers the player a variety of options to explore their time in Arma 3.
429	1	a	This game is simply... Amazing 10/10
5354	0	a	DONT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU LIKE LAG! I have a very high end PC and this piece of trash struggles to get over 40fps in signle player mode.
5143	0	a	They like to choke people down with there dlc and It's just become to much.
4279	1	a	Realy nice game... a few bad hacks and buggs still out for it but over all very good game
1523	1	a	This is a fantastic combat sim that has as much or as little depth and complexity as you would like. It's a shooter for grownups. Going back to COD et al will seem like a big step down to an arcade shooter. The learning curve is fairly steep with all sorts of key bindings and responsibilities, but boy is it satifying when you actually achieve something.   Great game.
3664	1	a	Though with my few hours I can honestly say that this game is just amazing. It took me a bit to learn how to play but once you get over the learning curve the game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing epic. There is a monumental scale of gamemodes all made by the community. I personally enjoy Wasteland a survival situation in which players are thrown onto a random location on the map and are forced to find gear to survive. Others include King of the Hill which is a major action packed gamemode where all gun fire is focused on one city. It's hectic. Though the price is a bit high you might think. The game is well worth the money for how much fun you will have.
2395	1	a	Fun and very realistic,
76	1	a	Brilliant Military Sim sandbox. Like simulators? Like Military Shooters? Like Sanbox games that encourage mods and community content?  If yes, you should already own this.
4943	1	a	Its a good game, great community. I have played it a while.... just a bit to..... test things out
776	1	a	If you're looking to implement tactics, this is the game by far. I highly reccomend this game to anyone wanting to escape the mundane FPS genre.
3708	1	a	This game is amazing especially if you like to do some rp then just buy the game.
1336	1	a	Great Game Fun To play This game gives so much online game modes to play you will never be bored :D
3028	1	a	hard to set up and get used to at first but once you get to know it you will love it!! :)
1597	1	a	This game is the best i recommed anybody who likes military first person/thired person combat
722	1	a	Worst game ever.                    Just kidding, it's actually the ULTIMATE military simulator.
3508	1	a	A Brilliant, yet realistic Military Game. As expected from the Arma Series!
1556	1	a	Umm I dont have this game but I can still review it. 10/10 would review again
5285	1	a	Gud game 2 lern armee stoof
4223	1	a	
4806	1	a	 8/10  There is so much content to enjoy in Arma 3-from cooperative missions to battle royale to wasteland. I guarantee you'll be spending hours playing through it all. The experience becomes even better if you have friends to play with. Even though the single player isn't very enjoyable, it's a huge leap from that of Arma 2. If you can catch Arma 3 on sale, I definitely recommend you buy it.
4667	1	a	The latest edition of the best military simulator series. Has a steep learning curve and requires an up-to-date machine to run, though.
3036	1	a	I love this game! I've been playing multiplayer a lot there past couple of days. If you are looking for a real military simulator this is the game for you. When you find players that will join a group with you and take the game seriously it is tons of fun. This is NOTHING like Call of Duty or even Battlefield. I would recommend this game.
4886	0	a	Don't buy this game unless you're willing to pay more money for a game you already payed for.  The game has the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥est marketing system I have ever seen, you have to pay $70 just to get it and an extra $20 to be able to use half the guns in the game, you would have thought its original hefty price tag would have been enough.  Other than that it's a good game.
2605	1	a	Finally a game thats actully realistic not like cod or battlefeild this game is fun to play the game has a variety of cars planes helis boats subs cars tanks and trucks if you like shooters but like realism i will recommed this game
22	1	a	I own two coppies of AOE3, that's just how great of a game it is. Between my retail copy and my steam copy I'd have nearly 1000 hours played. Positives: 'Card Deck Tech Tree' Allows you to select up to 35 technologies that are unlocked based on your XP in the match. The abillity to name your Explorer and Homecity. City leveling and user leveling adds noticeable multiplayer progression. Tradepost [specified spots on the map allow you to build a tradepost for extra resources, units and technologies offering a bit of a King Of The HIll feel]. Negatives: No diplomacy [unless a custom scenario], only 3 team options [FFA, 1 or 2], no capturing enemy units/technologies [in previous games you could use your priest/monk to convert enemies to your team].
1003	1	a	This game is one of the best millatary sims i have ever played it is worth its money so go buy this game. Hope you enjoy.
403	1	a	Died because of bots spamming with grenade launchers. 11 AI \ 10
1438	1	a	Amazing game a must have for all steam users and FPS lovers
1294	1	a	gr8 gme, luv gettin sick killz. careful tho, easy 2 die. be safe.
1595	1	a	I sh0t l0ts of Nazi! DEUSCHLAND!
2966	1	a	there is nothing more satisfying then having a entire squadron behind you as you charge into a town filled with brigades of semi Overpowered AIs that attack you from a valid distance. weapon selection and all movement is as real as she gets
4170	1	a	As a reddit gold user, I've waded through dirt and mud (referring to dreaded REPOSTS, haha!) before so I know what to expect from a real life army man simulator. This was not what I was expecting. I was put in to a tight spot with my team, I couldn't even move, let alone adjust my fedora to tip at the lady members of our team! (Just kidding, there were none! Get in the kitchen! Haha!) and I even died once while I was distracted, looking at the funnybanana meme WHICH YES, I DID SAVE. THANKS JOHN! It's a great game, but I don't think I'll be playing it much when I get accepted in to the r/megalounge! Haha! Get me a whiskey on the rocks, autobutler! Haha! - Peter
4156	1	a	This game is amazing. While the campaign and 'vanilla' multiplayer are extremely fun, it's not even the tip of the iceberg in terms of gameplay.  The real experience comes with the mods, scripted game modes, and editor included within the game, or downloadable through various websites. What Bohemia Interactive has done is give those with a vision the incredibly powerful engine (and therefore a means) to create the amazing gamemodes you can download anywhere and play.
3999	1	a	well I only have 100 hours on this one. But that's enaugh after I've played nearly 2000 hours of ArmA 2 OA with and without the DayZ mod.(440 or so hours wasteland, 220 hours on a single dayz server and about 150 - 200 on multiple other DayZ epoch servers via DayZ commander) The game is simply improved, it runs better than the old one does (at least on my system), looks great, is less clunky. The game is set in future (I dislike this bit) Is a time cow as alaways. To newcomers this game takes time. There are no quick 10 minute rounds. The meat of the game for me is on 120 people wasteland servers, where it takes time to get gear, takes time to travel, takes time to siege and objective and so on. An average paly session will last from 2 hours and up (If you want to acctualy acomplish something).   10/10 would recomend if you can run it.   Howerver I'd simply suggest picking up ArmA 2 when it's avalible for 5 or less euros, since the price is quite steep when not on sale and you're either going to love this (like I do) or hate it.   It's not comparable to Battlefield or Call of Duty. And even more so it's false to think that liking any of those games will make you like ArmA as well.  Also when deciding on making your purchase take a good hard look will you be able to run this game and if can play a game on 30 fps. I'm all PC master race guy with atleast full HD and 60fps as a requirment, however without the latest and greatest rig it's hard to swim around 60fps in this title. SP runs well, very well even, but when it comes to MP your expierence is close to unpredictable. On some servers you'll be running great and on some you'll have 10fps no matter what you do.   This game is uniqe. It's more like tools and materials that can be used to create a beautifull house, than the house itself. If you want to expierence the construction of your house rather than getting one already built, there is no better title than this one. 
1180	1	a	Very fun game.  If you have a group to play with it is much easier and also more funny.  I love flying helicopter and that is oneof my pros with this game.  Headset is useful allround and try the Bootcamp before you head to multiplayer.  Mods and addons is fun to have aswell, and also create own scenarios.   Co-op is my favourite gamemode.  I think I willl have a lot of good times with this game.
92	1	a	Spent 1hr crawling through woodland to get to the perfect sniping point and then accidentally threw a grenade killing me and my spotter.  10/10
3936	1	a	69/10
1160	1	a	+ Amazing Gameplay + Endless User Content and an inbuilt editor +Great community +Very nice graphics +Constant platform updates/DLC with plans for an expansion in future +Infinite replayability +Things for everyone, EG KOTH for casual users to full MilSim   -Quite graphically intensive -ArmA controls
4070	1	a	Ridiculously realistic movement, aiming &amp; shooting. Ridiculously realistic representation of Lemnos &amp; S. Stratis.  It's worth buying it just for the choosing of these two Greek islands for a battle terrain...
4925	1	a	Fun and epic game.
4639	1	a	Great for realism and simulation enthusiasts. But if your just buying this for wastelands or because you liked DayZ, you can promptly â¥â¥â¥â¥ off and not get this game.
2482	1	a	yes i recommend
2041	1	a	I've played this game more than any other I own. With the vast collection of mods available, there is an infanant numbers of ways to play. I personally enjoy playing modded COOP games with friends and implementing some of the many realism mods we have running. There is no good reason not to give this game a try.
796	1	a	Endless fun. Campaign, Editor, Multiplayer, Mods, Total Conversions. If its on sale and you dont buy it, I cant be your friend.
363	1	a	Best Game Series I have ever played (along with Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven).   Features:     Good-looking graphics.    Good AI, especially then they operate in squads.    Amazing editor and modding community, so you can literally do anything you want.    Atmospheric sound effects.    Simulation of everything, from realistic day/night cycle, to ballistics.    Immersion. Srsly, It's like you are there.    Great multiplayer, which has lots of game modes for your taste.    Zeus, so you can create and change missions on the fly for other players. You are literally God for others. Take that, Peter Molyneux!    Memorable experiences, You'll want to share with friends.    More stuff I forgot to mension.   Great game! C: 
681	1	a	Arma 3 has pretty much anything you're looking for... Tactical shooter experiences as Operation Flashpoint, Arma 1 and 2 did before it.  Fast-paced arena combat like one would find in Call of Duty or Battlefield, Arma 3 massively improved the handling of the player characters and makes faster CQC combat much more fluid. The addition of Zeus mode makes many, many styles of missions possible.  Vehicles, whilst nowhere near perfect are brilliant and can be used for whatever uses, be it combat, races or any number of minigame type missions.  This isn't even starting from the thousands of custom missions and hundreds of mods.
1257	1	a	Been so busy into the simulator for the last 3 years since release, I forgot about writing a review, notice how I said Simulator and not game, there's a reason for that you know.  First and foremost, as a military / enthusiast guy, since operation flashpoint, to arma 2, and now this, Arma 3, I can without a doubt say, it has increased my military knowledge by 50%. The other 50% is just personal knowledge / Experience.  This Military Simulator is for someone that is either in the military already, has plans to get into the military, or is just a military enthusiast that is hungry to know more about modern combat and how it works.  With the right set of mods, and the correct group of friends that match the criteria to your standards of MilSim, then I can say you are ready to conduct real time operations within a simulator and study that â¥â¥â¥â¥ for your own personal use.  The amount of knowledge you can get from this software is Unbelievable.  Now, it won't give you the balls to go battle, but it will definitly give you outstanding information in regards of how to survive a battle (in real life). Have no plans of going into battle, that's fine, but for your next hike, you can learn how to navigate through any terrain with the right map and compass.  I can go on and on on its uses and pro's, but I will leave it here, if you want to join one of the most professional military simulator Community out there that is free to join, go ahead and register at,   www.unitedoperations.net   there you'll meet me, and many other military dudes that provide courses on a regular basis (FOR FREE).  And remember, THIS IS NOT A GAME, it's a SIMULATION!
3813	1	a	The best words to describe this game are incredible. I've played Arma 3 for quite a while now, a total of about 1410 hours now, and it is definetly one of the best games that I've ever played, if not the best.  Like shooters? Arma 3  Like Roleplay? Arma 3  Like Strategy? Arma 3  Like MilSims? Arma 3  This game offers it all!!
5127	0	a	This game is probably the least fun game I've played in a long time. It tries to sell itself as a military sim, but it's as much a military sim as minecraft. Wandering an empty island for hours until you get shot by some guy six miles away is not fun. Also, 60 dollar price tag? Games like Red Orchestra 2 are so much better than this and are much cheaper. You're money is better spent elsewhere.
3413	1	a	Arma 3 is perfect !!! my only complain is about the game is not 100% optimized i still drop frames altho i have i7 4790 oc and 970 gtx oc 4 gb , i hope they will optimize it soon as we know there wont be Arma 4 soon
126	1	a	Wow I love it. Amazing game. What a joy to play. Already years beyond anything I have seen in either battlefield or cod. As a former marine. I love the hardcore nature of the game. I loged into a server and their were other people on team speak. useing real strategy. I am meeting friends. I love the fps system, I love all the ways you can customize your character. It's a dream to play. My only down side is sometimes on sandbox server the game is a little slow. I sat for over a hour just starting at trees not seeing anyone. But pvp fast action games, are a blast. The ai, is very smart, one of the best ai I have ever seen, ever. I am blown away by this game. I will easily sink a 1000 hours into this jewl of a game.
2480	1	a	best game ever i love it but dont buy the game if you dont hav a high end pc ;)
4681	1	a	This is a fantastic battlefiled simulator game which is great if you play with a community :)
2424	1	a	If you like anyting military than this is the game for you!! There are tons of fun multiplayer game modes ranging from RPGS, Sandboxes and Sector Controls. The single player is just as fun using player created missions and mods. Or you can spend hours just messing around in the simple to use misson editor. The devs are great and keep supporting and updating it, Arma 3 is more like a platform than a game.  Overall Its one of the best games ive ever played and has the most content ive ever seen. Worth every penny!!!
1791	1	a	you need a cpu and gpu that can curl at least an 60 pound dumbell in order to run this game smoothly
5005	0	a	this game is slowly dying along with its servers very hard to get into, and just not worth the price  refunded
1012	1	a	Super fun game worth every penny!
1572	1	a	set in 2030, hear the cry operation magnitude nato in europe eastern armies with their guns eastern, eastern, eastern armies with their guns   iran, you would too,  its a shooter game
249	1	a	Takes some practice to be good at this, and a lot more practice to work tactically as a team, But nothing is more rewarding than moving fluidly as a unit and getting things done without losing a single teammate. Once you get the tactics down you will then be able to fully enjoy this game. 8/10
2868	1	a	bets game evr i love this game to death i would play it everyday
3213	1	a	DONT BUY IF YOU WANT TO GO MULTIPLAYER. UNLESS YOU HAVE AT LEAST A 3.5GHZ INTEL i5   The game itself is a very nice realistc game with many weapons and attachments, many vehicles, many unique features and 2 GIGANTIC maps (about 300kmÂ²).  BUT:  -Multiplayer FPS still not optimized (was promised) -Collision-Detection still not improved (its obvious that something is wrong with a 3d game where you cant jump) -AMD Hardware optimization not even began.... (15-30 FPS in multiplayer...they couldnt care less bout AMD users) -AI is a not-so funny joke -Ground-vehicle behaiviour is far away from being realistic or enjoyable (they obvious tried both and failed) -Official Servers????? NOPE!!!!! -Matchmaking????? NOPE!!!!!  -CoOp play singleplay campaign?????? NOPE!!!!!!  RV engine 'Features':  -bad collision detection (the most essential part of a shooter) walking on rocks = falling through them and die. walking on stairs = get stuck and die. walking towards a wall = glitch through and die  -switch weapon while walking = standing still to switch weapon (finally solved in arma3)  -no free movement i.e. jumping, climbing, etc.  -massive desync between server and clients  -extremely slow server browser that you cant stop from refreshing  -extremeley clunky vehicle physiks  -undynamic sound engine (sounds cant move with their source)  -massive FPS problems on multiplayer and large scale ai missions  -non dynamic lightning (flashlights throw light through walls, etc.)  -several crashes  -non effective memory allocator  -no multi cpu/gpu support  -no 64bit support  -poor ingame voice chat quality   +realistic ballistic  +good sound effects  +nice graphics with huge viewdistance  +extremely huge maps  +nice 'stances' feature  +huge possible amount of players on 1 server    This list would be endless.   they should REALLY outsource the engine development, due NO PROGRAMMING SKILLS.  DayZ SA is the same â¥â¥â¥â¥ but even crappier (10-15 FPS in Towns while arma 3 gets around 20-30 FPS on a 50 Player Server).  They should have learned form ofp and arma1&amp;2 that they are unable to programm a stable and performant game engine. So why dont spend some of the earned money to the development process  (as promised in the EA phase) and buy a decent engine from someone, who is able to programm such an engine (UE4, Cryengine 3, Unity)????????????  they set the wrong priorities and ignore the simplest rule of programming: ______________________________ *****KEEP YOUR CODE CLEAN AND FAST***** -----------------------------------------------  they earned at least 200million$ with dayz(&gt;10mil. copies sold)  and about 30million$ with arma 3(&gt;1mil. copie sold)  what are they doing with the money?  the development team is &lt;100 persons  its not personal costs. its not sound recording. its not the mocap sessions. its not engine optimization. its not even design or modelling. its their â¥â¥â¥â¥ING OWN POCKET, where the money goes.  They are taking our money with hands WIDE OPEN (spend about 50â¬ for arma 3 and about 23â¬ for DayZ), promise to use it for the game and dont spend it in the development process as promised.  Bohemia Interactive has great artists and designers + a good know of realistic weapon behaviour, but the dev-team leaders, and programmers are even stupid as hell or only want your money for no effort....  i really hope, that they are opening their eyes and start optimizing their company, or no one will ever buy another arma or dayz. i wouldnt. i made my experiences with Early Access and Bohemia Interactive, and must tell: THEY ARE LAZY AND MERCENARY. Update Cycles from DayZ are a bad joke. take a look at H1Z1. It was released over a year later, with a MUCH smaller budget, and has updates AT LEAST EVERY 2 Weeks...
954	1	a	This game Is loads of fun, I love it
1340	1	a	Fantastic game Buy it Now !!!
676	1	a	Pretty good I guess, Alistair rates 10/8 for realism
3214	1	a	As a former soldier, with two tours of duty under the belt I can certainly say from personal experience, this is incredibly realistic. The ballistics, the sounds, the atmosphere. Took me a while to get into, as I didn't have the best setup. Still gives me sweaty palms, and makes my heart race in places. Has certainly helped reduced effects of combat stress on my mind. Unwinding, playing a few hours really helps. Highly recommended. Seriously, give up on COD/BF series if realism is your goal. Arma all the way!  Hoping that VR compatibility is the developers' list of things to do....   DT
2620	1	a	This game is very fun! Both Singleplayer and Multiplayer. However, it depends on what server you find, you may find a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ one at first and rethink the choice you made about buying this game. Or you can find an AMAZING server and absolutely fall in love with the game. If you find one of those bad servers, keep searching! You can find that one server that is fit for you! Best Army Sim you can find out there! This game is a BIG $60 but trust me, it is worth $100!
2095	1	a	I've won 64 player Battle Royale TWICE  What have you done? Loser
3079	1	a	Very good game, perfect resolutions, and nice settings, the game is fun to play, awesome, chillin' with friends, but lots of glitches that needed to be fixed.
641	1	a	I Love this game its good graphics and addicting
1535	1	a	Amazing Game! Defintitely would recomend! Expecially during summer sale!
3698	1	a	Gr8 2 play m8.  Buy dis ples
1609	1	a	Good game, read my review on Arma 2 OA for pretty much what you need to know. Game is roughly the same in my opinion
4113	1	a	Such a great game the combat is unlike any other game takes more than just pulling a trigger takes actual skill to be good The community is fantastic the amount of things to do on this game is unreal if you know where to look   However you are going to need a beefy computer to run this game    Fantastic game 10/10 would recommend
4673	1	a	Good Game for Roleplaying
4922	1	a	Remember when driving into a chicken-wire fence would blow up your car around 60% of the time?  Let's bring those days back.
395	1	a	Lots of guns, lots of explosions.  Much worth money.
5107	0	a	I keep trying to play this game but I just can't enjoy it because I get 9-20 fps with a i5 cpu and gtx 970 gpu... The game is horrible because of this... When Arma fixes their fps issues then the game will be the best fps and 3rd person shooter ever to exist. I beg them to fix their game... I as well as many others desperately want to play this with a managable framerate.
1864	1	a	This game is the best game I have ever played, it has great servers with some pretty awesome communities. 10/10
13	1	a	All the feels are comming back when i played this game 8 years ago . I loved it so much i have two copies cd and steam, you can not go wrong if you puchase this game   10/10
1809	1	a	So real, my squad and I sat out in the middle of no where telling lies about women.
4545	1	a	its okay, performace is a nightmare even if you optimise the game, but I guess thats what you get for using the since 2001  disclaimer: i dont actually know for sure if the engine was made in 2001 i heard it and im too lazy to google it please dont â¥â¥â¥â¥ing lynch me
4795	1	a	Best simulation game ever!
3552	1	a	ARMA 3 is (one of) the best game(s) I have ever played - even after 2500+ h !   gameplay: 9/10 (Very complicated controls - at least at the start, you will need to put some time in optimizing them! But the movement system you get from that is amazing!)  graphics: 10/10 (It is a very good looking game)  sound: 10/10 (sounds amazing, if you hear the bullet crack over your head you will hope to see CAS engaging the enemys...)  performance: 7/10 (You need a very good processor to run arma 3 and it is not the best optimized game out there but it is a sandbox with massive modding support so if you look from that side its great)  conclusion: Very very good game!   I recommend this game! It offers something for everyone: Military sim (coop), RPG (life servers), FPS-styled gamemodes (king of the hill, wasteland), ...   Buy it, its worth the money!
506	1	a	4000 Hours in,  This game is 'meh'
256	0	a	Terrible optimization for AMD cpus's doesnt matter what GPU you have I struggle to have a stable 30 fps without turning everything off   Rig gpu-gtx 980 cpu-fx 8350 ram-8gb
4755	1	a	one of the best sim games ever made   
200	0	a	Let me start by saying that I have had fun with this game, as you can see by my playtime. But that playtime has been plagued by bugs, glitches, low FPS, and a constant feeling of 'Why didn't they...?' in the back of my mind. I never got into ArmA 2 because of its FPS problems, netcode, clunky and unintuitive controls, and just bad game design. ArmA 3 has fixed NONE of these problems.   - First off, the performance. The Real Virtuality engine is an engine from the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing 18th century being held together with duct tape and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Server performance still affects client performance. This is a joke. If the server gets overloaded, you are going to be looking at a framerate in the low 20s. This is why performance is so inconsistent.  - The player controller is the same one from ArmA 2. This â¥â¥â¥â¥ controller cannot play more than two animations at once, on the legs and the torso. Full body animations like switching weapons require the player to stop moving because of this. Again, this is a joke. Animations are also very stiff and crappy looking.  - Same old bugs and glitches from ArmA 2 that were never fixed. You can lean into walls and see through them, much worse if you're using 3rd person. Grass pops in right in front of your eyes. Objects like rocks are incredibly glitchy and can randomly kill you. Vehicle physics are almost non-existent and you will explode from the smallest crash. VOIP is incredibly laggy and sounds like it's coming out of a 90s phone.   - Game is supposed to use DX11 when in reality it still uses mostly DX9, one example is shadows. ArmA 3 still uses â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ stencil shadows instead of soft shadows, even on max settings. Aside from that, visually the game is nothing special. It has nice sunsets and a decent draw distance but up close it's quite ugly. Low res textures are a problem.  - The game is billed as a 'military sandbox' by Bohemia and a 'military simulation' by PC Gamer but â¥â¥â¥â¥ing NOBODY plays it as one. 99% of servers are gamemodes like Wasteland, Epoch, and Altis Life; gamemodes more suited to Grand Theft Auto than a game with as much potential as ArmA 3. Worse still Bohemia has done nothing to prevent this aside from adding that useless End Game gamemode that nobody plays. I was lucky enough to find a server that plays the game as the combined arms game it's supposed to be, and I played a lot on that server, but the FPS was so bad (~25) that I eventually stopped playing.   - Stemming from the issue above, tactical PvP just isn't a thing. There is some tactical PvE which I have enjoyed playing, but if you ever wanted to shoot at another player instead of those Terminator bots that can snipe you between the eyes from 2km away with a .45, you're out of luck.   - 3rd person. Everyone uses it, or rather abuses it. It's impossible to get the drop on someone in CQC because he's looking at you from around the corner using 3rd person. 'Don't play it', you might say. That's impossible, because I have never seen a public server with it disabled. 'Don't use it', you might say. Again impossible, because that guy looking over the wall at me will shoot me when I come around the corner unless I use 3rd person to look over the wall too.   - Updates are a farce. Game's been out for 2 years and only NOW we're getting bipods, really? The DLC is another joke, 30 euro for two helicopters and a couple of guns, wow Bohemia what a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing deal.   - 'Never half-â¥â¥â¥ two things. Whole-â¥â¥â¥ one thing.' - Ron Swanson. Driving physics are completely broken if you go anywhere that isn't a flat surface. Plane mechanics are pick-up-and-play. Guns sound like crap and basic stuff like keeping a round chambered doesn't happen. The only saving grace is the combined arms aspect, but alone they're terrible to play.   I'm going to stop here because I could go on all day about how â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game is and what it could have been if the devs cared at all. I never write long reviews, but how much I love the concept of this game and how awful the execution is made me. This game is NOT worth 50 euro, maybe 20 at best. The only good things here are the insanely huge maps and moddability of the game.   The only reason this game is popular is because there is no other game like it.
1732	1	a	Best Military game i have ever laid eyes on. I can never express my graditude and thanks to the develpoers for this amazing game. I truley do love this game. The first day i bought it i had 32 hours of gametime. You have to be orginized, this isnt black ops. Its the most realistic game i have ever played and wanna play! Nothing comes close to this game.! keep up the great work! #ARMA4EVER!!!!
1870	1	a	So good you don't notice the 20 FPS.
4268	1	a	best game ever made i give this game a 11/10  gamemodes that are the best  wasteland a badass action pvp war game mode  Altis life my personal fav. i have my own server wich is going amazing   patrol ops a realism task gamemode  all life gamemodes  so buy this game if you really want to have a great time and meet new ppl from around the world
87	1	a	Why is this game still 60 bucks it came out 2 years ago.
4146	1	a	Great game, one of the best all around modern day, military sim.
4504	1	a	Don't know why but at 5 pm, every server can't support us with our internet for some reason so be careful when buying it.
1194	1	a	Bought game, played online, ran 10.3km to battlezone, 30 minutes later died to enemy behind bush.  10/10 - Will play again.
3497	1	a	I love this game But i do not like the singleplayer
3646	1	a	Arma III is the best chopper crash test, LSD dragon catch simulator out there!!!! Watch out for druken pilots and soldier, everyone on arma is drunk or has take some drugs!!! And the level beginning   'Euhm I hope weÂ´re not gonna to die again... Me too Me too ... And we crashed again... Affirmative Shi t F a c k'  Well seriously this game is awesome, there are bugs, there are many bugs BUT this are funny as hell.  So if you got so often dissappointed by EA or Activision about their next 'big' title. You should buy this game!! At first I was like I donÂ´t know Arma I wonÂ´t buy it, and then there was a Steam sales and Arma 3 was free to play, and what should I say.... I got 19Hours play time since beginning, and just bought that game. And a big + is also the multiplayer community is that what it should have been in Battlefield, almost everyone is nice and you can work as a team together to get your objectiv.
5360	0	a	controls are clunky, horribly optimized, graphics suck, AI sucks and in some missions actively tries to get you killed.   and yet i keep trying out of pure boredom.  
1804	1	a	100/10 Worth erry $$$
1285	0	a	Only purchase this game if you are willing to purchase the apex edition for 70 damn dollars. Most AAA games are 60 and unless your just going to play the campaign, you are going to need to purchase the apex edition if you don't want to be swarmed with watermark ads when you attempt to use most weapons and vehicles. This price is too high for what you get in return. Many other games have double the amount of gameplay material than what this game has, and the price for the apex edition is still higher. Yes, I understand that there is the 'base content' and the 'apex' edition is just 'extra' but if I'm going to have to pay 70 dollars for this..... and many other games have way more content...... its a little bit high of a price. Of course, the arma devs probably won't see this review and if they do, well, im just one of the few people that think the price is too high for the quality of gameplay. On the other hand, I'd say minimum at least 40% of the people who bought this game don't even have a job. Just asked mom for the credit card and called it good. But hey, what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ do i know?
4281	1	a	please give me back my time what I spend playing this excellent game :D
199	1	a	I witnessed someone driving a pickup truck, then crashing into a rock and exploding into a fiery hell. 10/10
5099	0	a	I'd rather stab myself with a rusty pair of pliers repeatedly until death than endure this buggy mess.
1903	1	a	Should you buy this games? YES Is it a MMO and Shooting? YES Do you love it? YES Is it like dayZ Standalone? DO YOU HAVE BRAIN ISSUE? Is there Roleplay Server? YES AND THERE CHICKEN ON THE ROAD Is the community Friendly? IDK IF YOU ARE A â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ WELL EXPECT THEY WONT BE FRIENDLY  This personnaly is like the best i ever play i met some awesome people and plus they all love Lord Gaben so you should buy this games because you will enjoy shooting bald head on altis server and enter in roleplay situation.  This games is a wild beat -Rock Paper Nuke  I love Chicken -IGN Noob Clan  Is there some Zombie? -Bald Head From Kavala  Can i drift in this games? -Team Drift Monkey  Is There a guy call KoolAid? -Agent Nikodim :P  Remember this is my opinion there a lot of other review by some other people !ENJOY!   -Agent Nikodim
3254	1	a	This game...  It can be seen as a good game. Or one that is terrible.   Most likely what will happen though is that some guy with 7 hours comes along and says it is garbage.  Then there will be that one guy with some 300 hours logged claiming that new players will have trouble adpating to Arma 3's engine and game mechanics.  In these reviews there are no middleground, so it could make someone feel like they need to log 300 hours to feel like the guy who wrote the review.   My review is written with 60-70 hrs of gametime. Here is My review:   The game has no real competitors, and the only things similar to it is Arma 2 and the original Arma. This is what causes that beginning time gap to learn how to play the game. If I were to go and play COD, then switch to BF4(I know that they have a good amount of differences in them) I know I can, in 2 hours, play BF4 as well as I played COD, If I had logged the same amount of hours in both of them. Here, it's different. Since Arma has huge changes between the modern FPS games like COD and BF, then those who are new to the Arma Franchise will have to adapt. For me, I didn't adapt as soon as I got the game since I had gotten the game for Altis life(Something I will go into later). It took me around 6 hrs of missions to be effective in combat. By adapting from the Fps games I had usually played, I developed better habits in Arma. These habits include slowing myself down, going prone to stabalize my gun, and to stay with my sqaud. This is what makes Arma so unique. It is a simulator, and everything you do actually matters. So heres a breakdown of teh good and the bad:  Good  2 Large maps with great terrain and underwater features  a good selection of weapons and vehicles  Great graphcs  Great Workshop ability  Great Multiplayer Servers(Makes up the other 40% of Arma Users. Stuff like Altis life, takistan life, adn etc, are something other than war)    THE BAD  The graphics could kill your computer  First person mode can get people sick due to the preset settings  First person mode presets can also lower framerate  Cars have bad controls(again can be fixed in the settings)  The 6 hr beginner time gap  The impressions the game gives to people  Overall  8.5/10  Oh.. Did I talk about mods,   9/10 :D
4817	0	a	Was a fantastic game at one point. It has been ruined hard by power creep. Bohemia made the weapons in each DLC pack more and more powerful to basically force people into buying them, and we are to the point where laser accurate AK-12 7.62x39 rifles can one hit kill people through MRAP armoured windows.  A pile of garbage at this point.   Oh, and by the way, did you enjoy being able to hide behind things like walls and smoke? Well then congratulations, you cant anymore. They changed the way the renderer works so things fade in and out when they're supposed to be drawn or when LODs change. This has had the side effect of making it so that you can see through walls. This isnt even a thing you have to exploit, just being near something else (ie the window that you are shooting out of) can glitch out the renderer and make walls no longer draw, which means you can see enemies (who do not fade in and out).  Its something you personally can avoid, but all the guys shooting you through buildings with AMRs wont.  Wonderful...
1206	1	a	Amazing game for anyone who enjoys a fun military simulation! Great gameplay, graphics, lots of interesting mods and high replay-ability.
4378	1	a	I was all like, hey â¥â¥â¥â¥ me right my PC can run this. Apparently it â¥â¥â¥â¥ing can't and i can barely squeeze out 25 fps in towns, which infact makes it way more cinematic so thats good. Hey, i mean keep being autistic on RP servers tho, thats actually all you can do in this game.
617	1	a	Arma 3 is a wonderful platform for military simulation. Where the game truly shines is with the extensive modding community. You will do yourself a disservice if you do not check out any of the multitudes of mods for this title. The game itself with out the mods is a great improvement over prvious titles like Arma 2 for example. Personally I used to be big on the Battlefield series but once I started playing Arma it was Arma or nothing for my modern day first person shooter.   The depth and scope that you can get into here with the combined arms focus is truly amazing. Everything fromt he graphics, to physics to sound effects are really good. Oh and if You don't want to use the vanilla stuff, again there's mods, even full conversions that bring all the assests from previous games into this one.   There's also a really fun multiplayer mode called Zues, which is essentially Dungeons and Dragons meets first person modern day shooter. One player acts like the 'DM' and the others play in his / her world. Allowing you to create dynamic ever changing and unique situations on the fly.   This one gets my whole hearted thumbs up. For information on how to mod your game, check out this youtube video:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK6rsWMIvyI   
1413	1	a	This game is highly recommended if you want a real Military Simulation. This is not going to be your average call of duty or battlefield fps. If you want a real military experience here it is. This game has great graphics, AI can be a little annoying but you will get use to it, and there are lots of vehicles and weapons to choose from. I hope you buy this game, you will not make a mistake.
4883	0	a	This game is a HUGE improvement over ARMA 2 in terms of the engine and its looks, graphically. The game works much better than the second installment of the series, and is much easier to use. But, the game's setting has completely ruined it for me, I really dont appreciate what bohemia did moving the setting to 2034/2035. I really loved the setting of 1990-early 2000s ARMA 2 provided, and i dont feel that ARMA 3 provides a very immersive feel (For me, anyways) I'm sure there are mods to change the game for the more cold war 'feel'. But i havnt found many that are what i want.
2313	1	a	Fantastic games with a good variety of community made missions/mods etc.  If you were an avid ArmA 2 player, you'll love Arma 3!  The only problem I could see with this game is that it's quite diffrent from other shooter games, and maybe a little hard to get into without help from friends that have already been playing this or arma 2.
5153	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ shit i just paid 60$ for this game and now its on sale. â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. steam plz refund  
4916	1	a	If you are the type of person that likes military shooters and/or Milsim, this is the game for you. Great graphics, but slow at times. Mulitplayer fps is not the best. But this game is VERY CPU dependant. I reccomend this game if you have a good pc
5039	1	a	its lit
2699	1	a	If you are into the arma series I'd say give this one a try it's much more in depth and a bit more on the graphics than the rest so you will need a computer that's roughly 2012 or later or you will lag a lot even on low graphics. Solid gameplay and it is pretty fun with friends.
1238	1	a	When you look at most of the customer reviews on typical games, you'll generally see anywhere from 2-8 hours of playtime. Looking through the reviews for Arma 3, a majority that I see are over 100 hours and quite a few over 300-400 hours.   I think that speaks for itself.
5314	0	a	multiplayer is a broken mess!
2129	1	a	its good
4313	1	a	My favourite game so far! Looking forward to Arma 4 if thats gonna be a thing.. Hope it is!  Pure Awesome! 10/10 game - Teethed Goose studios
2987	1	a	This is the best game I own on the PC, and is definetily a keeper.
3170	1	a	Im going to be completely Honest, I bought this game almost exculsively to play the battle royale game mod. As such, i have played very little of the actual campaign of vinilla experience. I can say though that if you like or enjoyed ARMA style games, you will appreciate the leve of detail and dedication to realism this series provides. The controls are responsive, and the guns handle amazingly. Every time i died, it was 99% my fault and the other the lag I blame and curse over the microphone as I mourn my body. If you apprciate more realism to your games then straight up, over the top action, I would recomend giving this series a try. I did not mind spending the money and I bought this before the summer sale. I would highly recomend looking at the modding scene as well which is normally very active with ARMA series titles (Look at the dayz mod)
290	1	a	ARMA 3 makes me feel like i'm actually a soldier, carrying out objectives and operations like a soldier too instead of this hyper-active nonsensual chaos that is Call of Duty and Battlefield.  If you're a fan of ARMA or just hardcore games in general i seriously recommend this. Bohemia once again succeeds at delivering, improved AI and voice acting, stunning graphics and whole new arsenal of semi-futuristic guns, gadgets and vehicles that are sure to impress.   Step into a world where one shot is all that is needed, where teamwork truly is important...
3756	1	a	Least kids ive seen in an online game ever.
2356	1	a	Too good....... well that was easy
3173	1	a	Great game 9.5/10 Don't give this a ten because of these reasons  Fps is iffy  The bushes are made of metal Thats legit it  Heres the Good things Great guns Great cars Great models Great animations Great Game in all :D  in the end its worth the money but if you're running a not so good pc idk if you should get it since the fps tends to drop at certain moments
2708	1	a	8.9/10  This game is really a harcore FPS. The moments you get stem from bullets whizzing by as you just entered an ambush! You hear your friends yelling over the mic, â¥â¥â¥â¥ JACK IS DEAD! Every encounter is slow and planned and if it gets big enough becomes hectic. It encompasses BF3 and 4 and even some COD aspects of action (much less COD like .05%). The adrenaline rushes when you see an enemy are astounding, and get amplified as you understand your utter mortality.  The editor is great and I see amazing potential, even full fledged campeigns from users! Albeit it is hard to grasp and understand and requires constant bug testing from the users side to make sure that every trigger etc. work properly. Its as simplified of a complex editor that you can get. Once fully mastered allows for some amazing missions!    The downside is the optiimization, when i first got the game and did multi at the lowest setting i was getting 5 or 10 FPS. Now Im getting a solid 30, the Dev team truly listens. I like that they released this fix before they went on with their campeign etc. Since they realized that the community discovered a game breaking issue (kinda discovered they already knew but did not excpect this to affect so many people).    All in all the game mught have its bugs, but its a fabulous and hardcore game, with an in game editor that's as simple and proffesional as it gets, and a dev team that offer full support to thegame and are constantly improving it!  8.9/10
2026	1	a	Great game!
4291	1	a	I would recommend this game! But do not run any cheat programs for other games while yuo have this one. I was battleye banned for running a trainer for Wargame Red dragon. I always played this game with friends! Need a good pc to run this though. I played over 1000+ hours in this game until banned.
3243	1	a	It's good
2586	1	a	Goodbye fps.
2337	1	a	Excellent game, very easy to interact with the enviroment with the many poses etc.
4198	0	a	Simple cannot recommend a game that, filles your screen with dlc adds if you happen to use something that is part of a dlc you as a user don't own.  I do NOT say that I want it for free, I rather it was disabled then having commercials that destroys my gameplay experience.   To simply annoy the consumer until they give you the money to get rid of the adds, is something I expect when trying a app on my mobile divices not when I spend 45â¬ on a high budget game.  Just because they give it for free doesn't mean they get away with it scoot free, aspecially when this wasn't part of the product when it launched.  (Sorry for any grammatical errors)
4244	1	a	My favorite Multiplayer Game, also bunch of various mods.
797	1	a	The best game.
3072	1	a	If you are into military scenarios, this game is great for you. With the new engine and actual physics aspects, it takes a big leap forward for the Arma series. For me, it has been an amazing trip from Alpha into the upcoming release, an was not in any way a dissapointment. I can't wait for jets :D
949	1	a	Amazing game good graphics 
4739	1	a	i'm just so glad this game doesn't have dayz.
2904	1	a	Hard to run on â¥â¥â¥â¥ pc == Little to no 10 year olds! Yay!
2075	1	a	ITS THE BEST GAME EVER! IT INTRODOUCED ME TO PROGRAMING AND TO THE BEST PEOPLE I COULD EVER MEET I REALLY RECOMMEND IT
780	1	a	Great game, really gets you addicted, worth the money(check out â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, for cheaper price). Still a bit buggy, and need some tweaks. But nothing major. You'll need a good computer, but with the recent multiplayer updates, im getting better fps at this then ARMA 2.
2338	1	a	pretty awesome
4683	1	a	This game is one of the best Military shooters. It requires a clear head and patience. 10/10
2831	1	a	One of the best games on steam. Countless hours of fun, so much worth.
4601	1	a	Well. This is going to be gud.  First off was playing King of the Hill.  So I was running around and a â¥â¥â¥ sitting on a hill killed me.  Then I respawned was hiding in a house and stairs killed me #fakyoustairs  Then I got in a chopper and some â¥â¥â¥ kamikazid me what a â¥â¥â¥.  Then I ran into a wall, the wall killed me.  Fell through the floor of a house. â¥â¥â¥â¥ builder #BlameTheBuilders.  Then I got a jet. May or may not of recreated 911   There is my review of Arma 3. THEY ARE NOT BUGS THEY ARE FEATURES!!!! :D
3419	1	a	Me and one of my friends are playing on a Insurgency Startis server when is heli goes down. I get sent out on a rescue mission when my chopper, which is flying over him, gets hit by Anti-Air and goes down hard. He comes over and revies me only to relise that we are right next to an enemy base with a MORA circiling it. We manged to take the zone only left with the MORA still rolling. My friend picks up a launcher with only one rocket. 'Make it count' I say. He misses. The MORA turns and sees us then we scatter. Behind the MORA was a Offroader with a machien gun mounted on the back, which we imediatly run for, relising its our only chance. We make it. I drive while my friend shoots all the while the MORA is chasing us. Bullets are flying in all directions. We finnaly lose the MORA and end up in the AO, Agios Efstratios. Im driving with my friend on the outskirts of town when we get blow up. By four IED's. I die but my friend lives. We then come under motor fire, my friend still somehow, alive. He revives me and make it across town. We've captured the AO and everyone on the servers celebrating, except or OPFOR. One of them snipes my friend in the back. while the sniper reloads, I fireman carry him over a hill under cover. I patch him up and we rain motor fire all over the city.  9/10 would swim with fishes again.
4359	1	a	Very moddable, lots of workshop content it really brings this game alive!
4957	1	a	Intel 2 Cores 2 Thread = 10 fps 2 Cores 4 Threads = 11 fps 4 Cores 4 Threads = 40 fps 4 Cores 8 Threads = 80 fps 8 Cores 16 Threads = 140 fps AMD 2 Cores 2 Modules = Doesn't Run 2 Cores 4 Modules = 12 fps 4 Cores 4 Modules = 20 fps 4 Cores 8 Modules = 22 fps  Solution to good gaming experience in arma 3. Waste $3,000 on a decent PC.
1742	1	a	The Arma series is the best by far. in my opinion no game can top it for simulation or realism. Arma 3 could do better tho. (no offence)... ... ... as it says in the description 'Experience true combat gameplay in a massive military sandbox...'. I would love to have Arma 3 go a little bit more into detail with some aspect's of the game. But becides that it is amazing. I would recommend this game to anyone who like military game's. If ur a COD or Battlefeild (Which I am but not as much as Arma 3) fan watch out because Arma 3 is the next big thing.   &gt; Profile Name &lt;,   Game On!
5211	1	a	Great successor for the ArmA series.  The game itself plus its modded game modes will never get old.
2146	1	a	Very nice graphic thruu , Play mutiplayer Server = BEST / KOTH / Altis life
590	0	a	After years of enjoying the Amra series, im sad to finally change my review to no. At this point the paywall is unreal. The mandatory nature of each ever increasing in price dlc pack makes the game something that cant just be picked up on a short term notice. The original game is nice, the communities and mods out there are great, but the fact that you are now REQUIRED to run apex to do anything other than solo campgian is horrid.  Enjoy the milsim, I'll be playing elsewhere unless the DLC takes a 80+% pricedrop permanantly, as the playerbase continues to shrink from blaoted content packs that destabalize and break the game for those with or without.
4125	1	a	Is a good game. Nice People on the game. 10/10  
827	1	a	This is PCMASTERRACE at its BEST...  ...and also at its WORST  Accept no substitutes!
1745	1	a	Oh, Arma. You treat me like dirt, yet I still want to be in you. Walking the thin line between love and hate.
4915	1	a	If you like playing games at low fps, this game is for you.        No joke lol.
3117	1	a	its ok
4443	1	a	it's ok
3734	1	a	Never actually really got to play the game :/ 2.6 hours of trying to load it xDDDDDDD
3263	1	a	Amazingly beautiful graphics, and Breaking Point is one of the best game mods I've played. I really enjoy the King Of The Hill game-play, in Arma 3, too.  The only downside is you need a very rad computer, mainly CPU, to play this without horrible lag.  I recently upgraded to a 4th gen i5 and a GTX 750ti which has greatly improved the playability of this game.
685	1	a	A completely realistic depiction of real world combat in the near future. Hurhur. As with any BI title, ArmA 3 is a slow burn game that the community will collectively fix and improve far beyond the scope of the original release. If you're at all into warfare simulation and kinda-realism, this is the apex of the genre for the foreseeable future.
116	1	a	It's the dead of night on the CSAT-occupied island of Stratis, and the peaceful darkness is about to explode into chaos. I'm leading one of two spec-ops teams on a mission to liberate the leader of a local guerrilla faction and return him to the much larger island of Altis. A British squad is in charge of the actual rescue. Our job is to cause as much trouble across the island as possible to distract the CSAT forces and give the British the opening they need.  Over the next hour, that's precisely what I do. Inserting by boat from the northwest coast, I head south and raid an ammo dump before cutting across to the eastern shore to destroy a heliport. Then my squad suppresses an enemy encampment from a hillside near the centre of the island as I swoop in from the west to flank them. Yet before we can regroup, my entire team is killed by reinforcements descending from the north, and the British still need more time to complete their mission. Alone, I rush to the southernmost tip of the island, where I blow up a fortified anti-air position before escaping by riding a quad bike back through the swarming enemy forces to the extraction point, where the boat takes me home.  Arguably the biggest complaint about Bohemia Interactive's post-Flashpoint games is that their campaigns haven't used the magnificent landscapes they create to their full potential. The first Arma's campaign was a hastily cobbled-together disappointment, while it took a certain zombie-survival mod to harness the austere and foreboding power of Arma 2's Chernarus. That Arma 3 uses half an island for just one of its twenty-odd missions is indicative of Bohemia's effort to resolve this ongoing issue. Indeed, taken as a whole, Arma 3 strives to make this deep and impenetrable military simulator series a more comprehensive, more engaging and more user-friendly experience. It isn't completely successful, but I had an awful lot of fun watching it try.  While Arma 3 was officially released back in September, the campaign has been portioned out in three substantial chunks over the last six months. Each chapter is a self-contained entity with its own story arc and theme; combined, they tell the tale of the excitingly named Corporal Ben Kerry and his role in the war over the fictional Mediterranean island archipelago of Altis and Stratis, waged between four different factions.  The first part, Survive, is geared towards introducing players to Arma. It takes place entirely on the smaller of Arma 3's two islands, Stratis, and sees Kerry banding up with a group of NATO survivors after the local Altian Armed Forces, backed by NATO's eastern equivalent CSAT, rise up against the local US garrison. For the most part, missions are small-scale skirmishes that keep you firmly in the 'follower' category while teaching you the basics of minimising your daily lead intake. Rescuing a downed helicopter crew instructs you on establishing a defensive position, while a midnight liaison with local militia explains how to flank and clear buildings.  It's hardly the campaign's most spectacular stage. Story-wise, it's let down by voice acting that ranges from passable to cringeworthy and a script that understands military radio chatter but not how human beings interact with one another. Even here, though, Bohemia's approach to maximising the assets it has built is apparent. Missions are nearly always multi-staged, with objectives being added and changed as events rarely go according to plan.  While it smoulders rather than sparks, Survive concludes strongly and the momentum is carried over into Adapt, definitely the best of the three chapters. This introduces Altis, a masterwork of environmental design. I could write another 1000 words on its remarkable sights and sounds: its misty dawns, crimson dusks and streetlight-speckled nights. But what's most important is how the detail that's gone into mapping the landscape's undulations - the lumps and bumps, hills and valleys - plays into the game's combat. A little rise in the ground might be the difference between life and death as you throw yourself down in evasion of the fiendishly accurate enemy AI. When they stop to reload, you'll rush to locate a better vantage point, order your men to 'find cover' (an extremely handy new command) and plant half a dozen bullets in your opponent's surprisingly tough body.  Tactics are vital in Arma 3, but it's terrain that really makes the difference between success and failure. It's crucial to learn this before Adapt begins, because the difficulty suddenly ramps up. The first mission sees you alone, unarmed and with a city full of enemy soldiers between you and any kind of safety. At this point, setting saves to unlimited using Arma's highly customisable difficulty levels becomes a necessity. Fittingly, after Survive, you will die many, many times. That said, it's important to note that combat is more satisfying than before thanks to improved animations, smoother weapon handling and better optics - meaning the challenge stems from your opponents rather than clumsy controls and slow-to-aim weapons.  Adapt also changes the way you play. It gives you a squad to control, which is a mixed blessing. AI units tend to be much more perceptive of enemy locations than you are and are especially useful when facing down tanks and APCs, but they also require a fair amount of babysitting to keep them alive, and the lack of changes to Arma's squad commands means this can be a chore. Especially problematic is AI ammo management; your teammates go through bullets like a swarm of locusts through a corn crop, and resupplying them in the field is a nightmare in Arma 3's clumsy interface.  Alongside its story missions, which include the brilliant raid on Stratis described above, Adapt also introduces an open-world component. From your base you can go out on 'Patrol' and complete multiple optional objectives, from clearing enemy checkpoints to smoking out a sniper hidden inside a labyrinthine industrial complex, all while collecting weapons, ammo and equipment to use during the main missions - though the clunkiness of Arma's inventory management means this is less enjoyable than it should be. If you want to bring stuff back to base, you need to find a vehicle and load it item-by-item from your own inventory, while before each mission the game defaults to a standard equipment loadout and items you previously had can be lost in this process.  After the meatiness of Adapt, the final chapter Win feels fleeting by comparison, with only six missions to its name. But they're also the most spectacular, displaying vast, combined-arms battles that cover sweeping areas of Altis. It's strongly reminiscent of the opening of Operation Flashpoint, but with you in control rather than being led by an AI squad leader. In these closing stages you can call in devastating artillery strikes and helicopter assaults, simultaneously demonstrating the sheer destructive power of modern warfare and your own insignificance in the scale of things. Story-wise, it's also the most interesting segment, making unsettling use of its near-future setting and offering a branching conclusion that is fascinating, whichever direction you take.  Arma 3's campaign is a big, powerful, deeply engrossing thing, but there is one disappointment: its lack of vehicular missions. Since the story focuses on one not particularly interesting character who is ultimately a grunt, there are no tank missions, no helicopter missions and no jet missions. I can understand why, to a point: Arma's vehicles, especially its airborne offering, take time and effort to learn to control. Moreover, in these kinds of games infantry combat tends to be more enjoyable anyway. On the other hand, Flashpoint offered plenty of vehicle engagements during its campaign without any issue, and it's frustrating that, 13 years on, Arma's campaigns still lag behind it in terms of breadth of experience.
2637	1	a	My computer is in the 99th percentile on 3Dmark and this game still lags.  10/10
3273	1	a	This is a great game for anyone with experience with first person shooters. You might not want to buy this as your first FPS game becasue of the steep learning curve and the amount if controls. but after some time it becomes a lot of fun. i have had a lot of good experiences in this game that i dont think i could get from another FPS. It has many cool features that you just cant get from other games, like for example the ability to make use of any vehichle around you and use that as an advantage in the field. or maybe get a laser deignator off an enemy body and use that to mark targets for your friends. there is even gamemodes for roleplay. like altis life, and arma 3 life which can be fun if you like to roleplay with other people. I think the possibilities in this game are endless. you can make your own missions and submit them to the workshop for other people to download and rate, etc. I have had more than 500 hrs in this game and i think every one was a lot of fun. 10/10
4849	1	a	Arma 3: is a good game but has it's bugs but over all and rilly good game
4749	1	a	i love killing people and selling drugs in this game awesome game 100,000,000,000/100,000,000,000 great game who ever the hell made this
1957	1	a	Do not buy this game if you only play conventional shooters. Buy this game if you are willing to sit down and learn a surprisingly advanced Mil Sim. (If you play Altis Life, I want you dead).
3364	1	a	The hot-doggiest game your butt will evr experience in its whole lifetime! Gun play is great and if something ain't for you, then visit the workshop!
4588	1	a	Its the greatest game i ever seen in my whole life 
4596	1	a	I started of playing ArmA 2 but came out somewhat frustrated because of the controls and interface, the game explored new concepts but was not an enjoyable or intuitive interace. ArmA 3 and a completley different expirience for me. The game still looked and felt like ArmA 2 but they have fixed my few problems that I had with the previos game, making probebly the best expirience in a game ive had in a long time, The map 'Armory 2' by Happy Comedy makes the game easier to learn alowing players to test out vehiclels, a must have map. The 60 dollar price point can turn people off but trust me, if you are looking for vehiclels, guns, boats, scuba diving, drones, tanks, cars, planes, helicopters, and a @#$% ton of amazing and cool mods, this game is definitly for you.  -Fuze
4577	1	a	To much fun
4124	1	a	the world's formost simulator in muslim killing technology you shoot sandies and blow stuff up, america style B)
4415	1	a	Arma 3 is not quite a first person shooter, it really is more of a 'war simulator' overall. It is highly detailed and looks great visually but there can be a bit of a learning curve. The games strong point, in my opinion is the way it tries to do multiplayer, where you make missions and what not. I find this single feature what makes Arma stand out the best. More shooters should have the level of control Arma 3 gives players. There were a few 'cons' to all of its 'pros' though, so I will list my biggest as follows.   1. Multiplayer Servers (if not set up properly and efficiently) can make the game squat down and take a huge dump on your FPS (frames per second)   2. I feel the multiplayer user interface could use some work. making the game more accessible to new players.   3. Better single player. Arma may be best for its multiplayer but I think overall more work could be done making the single player experience more enjoyable.   All in all I think Arma 3 does the 'shooter/ war simulation' best, it may not be as popular as games like COD or Battlefield but thats not a bad thing. Imagine if it was that popular, then we would be dealing with those 'guys'...
764	1	a	You really need to play this to realise what a skillbased shooter is all about. And it's fun to boot!
4868	1	a	this is the game i got a pc for and im so glad i did.it looks amazing and.there are a lot of buttons to get use to but u can just use basic buttons to get started and learn on the fly.the battle royal mod is worth the price alone.cant say enuff good about this game.get it 
4834	1	a	Vanilla ARMA 3 is alright, but ive found it to be better with mods from both the Workshop and Armaholic. Ive got in total about 30 monds that run everytime i play.   I do however dislike the fact that they went all futuristic with the guns (the MX series is 'based' on the ACR) Leaving it up to the modding community to devolope mods that add in better guns :)
372	1	a	DON'T BUY IT THROUGH STEAM! FOR TODAY EVERY ARMA GAME IS FOR 21 BUCKS   https://store.bistudio.com/products/arma15-bundle 
3476	1	a	brilliant graphics and amazing military experience ! MEIN FURHER STEINER.......... 
2257	1	a	A great game for military enthusiasts, those looking for a run and gun experience similar to COD or Battlefield should look elsewhere though. Its tough and unforgiving at first, but when the games mechanics click into place it becomes a tactical battle. The game is great for its multiplayer components and the modding community keep releasing some fantastic mini campaigns and scenarios. The world is huge and the selection of vehicles and weapons gives enough diversity to keep the game fresh. Theres a lot of running and moments where nothing much happens, but this gives you time to admire the impressive graphics and vistas that are on show. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a patient, realistic and tactical experience of warefare.
4493	1	a	A very great game to play 
4552	1	a	The most joy you will get from this game isn't in the playing itself, but instead the creating of your own custom content and seeing others enjoy it.
3193	1	a	This is a good buy but be warned it is not like ArmA 2 and does not have as much content. The devs have almost seem to let the modding comuunity to take over the content. Also here is a list of bad:    1) ArmA 3 is not optimized for AMD players in multiplayer. I can turn my graphics from low to high and still get 25 fps on all of them when i play multiplayer. My friends who actaully has a GTX card can only get 30-35 fps, but switch it over to the campaign or editor mode and fill it with crap I can run 40-60 on standard both maps. 2) Go mess around in ArmA 2 then go to ArmA 3 there is so little content available in ArmA 3. I mean you had ever type of weapon on a humvee from a m249lmg to a TOW laucher and so did the other light vehicles. The weapons there was at least 30 base weapons giving awesome customization. vs what 5 or 6 that really the only wirthwhile thing that can change is the sights. 3) No bipods great mill sim there (Dayz has a bipod) 4) The inentory system is a bit wonky to me but maybe that is just me. 5) Steep learning curve 6) AI will kill you with one shot from a 9mm pistol when they are on the otherside of the town. 7) AI can take 3-6 bullets from your standard issued MX rifle that shoots a 6.2mm (Battle rifle basically) 8) Vehicle warfare is boring since even the tanks can't take but one rocket before they are critically damaged (And most launchers lock onand you can not block the lock)
1475	1	a	Great graphics, but there is still alot that can be improved! I recommend this game.
4460	1	a	I love this game, it has brought me plenty of fun and I can assure you that you will like it too. If you have enough cash to buy this game (as it is expensive) I highly, highly recommend.
3577	1	a	lotta fun with the right ppl
688	1	a	Only played a couple of minutes but it seems pretty good so far
2418	1	a	This game copied off of call of duty. Run and gunners get 37 kills while the 37 campers scratch their balls and die. Then they have these a.i missions made by babies for babies. Easiest game I have ever played gonna have to give it 0/10 no quickscoping.
904	1	a	GENERAL. Arma 3 is an amazing game that simulates real military action,objectives and tactics.Once you start the game for the first time you will see that there are tonns of controls  and commands,but you'll get the hang off it eventually. We'll start off with the campaign.You play as corpral kerry in the NATO forces.Altis and Stratis the two main islands are being invaded by CSAT(bad guys).Even though there is nothing you can do about it,the NATO forces are trying to  force them back,and near the end of the campaign you have  two choices, try and find out where james(friend) is or play a part in the final stand against CSAT,depending on the choice  you choose you could win or lose.The map editor is a good addition, it alows you to create your own missions or you could just tour upand down the islands like i do.The scenery on the  islands look amazing and realistic and driving at night is even better. The realistic weather is by far the best weather you'll see in a  long time,like if the start of a mission is suny the weather will probably change drasticaly.It is also very easy to get lost in the vast open world at night but the accurate star map should help you find your way. Also look out for animals like goats,deer and rabbits on land,in the sea there are fish,turtles and sharks to make you nervous when diving. There is a dedicated community on steam workshop,they create player made missions, weapons,vehicles and mods.   There are also updates rolling in frequently to improve the game.  AIRCRAFT. The aircraft in the game look well designed from helicopters to jet fighters but you do have to be a certified aircraft pilot if you  want to play multiplayer or a lot of people will laugh at you because you crashed the 3 million dollar aircraft.  LAND VEHICLES. The land vehicles also look well designed.The selection of tanks in the game are plentiful.The civilian cars are good for exploring the huge islands and The infintry transport look and drive just  like they should.  WATER TRANSPORT. There aren't as much boats as there are land vehicles but there  doesn't need to be.There are 2 civilian boats and 2 military boats. There are also submarines as well.  Pros 1 Great simulation. 2 Big open world to explore. 3 Amazing scenery. 4 Well designed vehicles.  cons 1 Hard to learn aircraft piloting.  Over all score 8/10
5158	0	a	very bad optimization. i cant even play
2881	1	a	Most fun I've had in a game in years. Realistic bullet physics. A+
2579	1	a	Even though it's not as optimized as it could be this game is an absolute gem. I remember that scene from Black Hawk Down where they call in a chopper, throw a IR grenade on the roof and the chopper comes in to save the day. i experienced that on a normal public server and that is the thing about Arma. whether you're in to competitive pvp, survival mods, usergenerated singleplayer missions or HUGE COOP operations, this game's got it 10/10
2345	1	a	if you like butt stuff you will like arma 3. all praise the booty.
2449	1	a	most satisfying game to win at!
3632	1	a	Great Game
2277	1	a	Awesome game! I love it. Looking forward to the expansions and mods being released for this!
219	1	a	Arma 3 is everything that I have ever wanted within a simulation shooter. I purchased it in Alpha and I was completely unaware of the amount of gameplay possibilites! You can go all out and re-create a real life scenario with the simplified editor layout, you could role-play on one of many open world servers, or you could just jump on a CO-OP server and use teamwork to destroy your enemy.. I had never played an Arma game until now and I have no regrets whatsoever for purchasing Arma 3 in Alpha and watching the game progress as it has. You would be a fool to not buy this game during any type of sale!!! The reason I really love this game is because it incorporates three of my favorite games from 'years ago'. Those games being 'Choplifter', Arma 3 has an AMAZING 3D Version with so many more options and settings and you can carry actual players and fuel/damage/ammo...ah, so good. The first game I played, some guy was screaming at me to get in the chopper, and as we arrived to the LZ I heard the pilot say, 'Good Luck guys', and I was completely blown away!! I thought that it was an AI pilot! The second, 'Black Hawk Down' for pc from like 99', the PVP is so much similar but way better. Last but not least, 'Battlezone2', that was my favorite game of all time as a kid with custom base building and defending your base. I recommend finding a community as soon as you get into Arma 3, you will instantly become immersed into the game with a full community of people from all around the world. Arma 3 is a great action packed shooter with lot of simulation aspects, a ton of different gamplay styles and gametypes, and a great place to make friends that will take you to a new level in the Steam community. More friends more fun..... WIN WIN! And the Mods! End of Story..... See you in the battle soldiers! Be sure to get it before 2015 rolls around, 'Make Arma Not War' is going to add so much and I have high hopes for the future of Arma 3.
201	1	a	Hmmmm... Not entirely sure how to start this review. This the first ARMA game I have played. While the game even now is buggy and glitchy, its still an extremely solid 'soldier' exprience. I love the atmosphere generated through this game and large scale battles which ensue are always a joy. Also the amount of content under the steam workshop will keep you going for hours and hours. As far as 'realistic' shooters go, ARMA 3 is probably one of the best well if you can put the issues with the game aside.  Final Score: 85/100
4176	1	a	Great graphics, realistic gameplay and i had a great experience with this game. Much better than any other shooting games like : Battlefield and Call Of Duty.  Succesfully made me fat. ._.  Recomended 10/10 -DatFpsPlayer
4748	1	a	Other than the few glitches and bugs, this game is about the best simulator I have ever played. ITS YOUR CALL! YOU CAN PLAY IT SERIOUS such as RPG servers or even for fun such as Stratis-Altis- Life. The mods available are very fun and diverse! Top NOTCH!
401	1	a	Any other fps game is just for kids! This is the big deal, it's so realistic that when you shoot or land a helicopter you have to check the wind or you will miss.
3983	1	a	great game grhapichs amazing gameplay mods 10/10/ wouild buy again
4628	1	a	great game. 11/10 if you dont mind it murdering your system
27	1	a	PLease make another! AOE 4
4165	1	a	What? Why are you reading the reviews? Why haven't you already purchased this yet?  ARMA 3 is the epitome of virtual tactical military-based operations and simulation. In my eyes, this game is not just a simulation of military firefighting and combat; I find this game is a great practice for team-based cooperation and initiative. You need to work together to complete your goal, follow your Team Leader to succeed.  There are many game modes that simplify the standard operations so new players will be able to experience the game in a friendly and forgiving environment that allows you to improve your abilities.  ARMA 3 is a grand game and I definitely recommend it.
541	1	a	One of my favourite games in my library. Still has some glitches but is best to play with friends.
2101	1	a	I was able to write a review for this i don't even own the game 10/10
204	1	a	If you like taking screenshots, this is the game for you!
481	1	a	This is the most buggy, broken game i have ever played. Yet i can't stop playing it... You Win BiS
3113	1	a	This game is by far the best first person shooter so far. much better than some of the other games out there.   I HIGHLY recommend this game.
3452	1	a	A really great Military Simulator.  The amount of content and detail in this game is great and will give you hours of fun to have! From a great SP campaign to a diverse and intense MP along with CO OP missions with friends, there is endless content in ArmA 3!!
4977	1	a	Really fun 
3226	1	a	If you enjoy tactical shooters and playing online with friends, it's well worth a look; especially if you appreciate a high dose of military realism!
1427	1	a	Very Good game with endless amout of fun and action will the mod support
3866	1	a	10/10 Would Play Again!
4433	1	a	Its a very good game. :D
3611	1	a	Best Mil sim on the market.
5408	1	a	I rarely play online, and don't do much single player. I have no idea how i have 100 hours, it must be good.
1434	1	a	war simulator flight simulator life simulator tank simulator racing simulator? or just enjoy the view. THIS GAME PUSHES IT TO THE LIMIT GRAPHICALLY. (considering you can handle it) very worthwhile experiences.
4351	1	a	Sniped a copilot at 1000m then was lining up a shot to kill the pilot, got kicked for inactivity.  Best experience 10/10 would get kicked again.
2329	1	a	First things first. This review is more like comparing to previous Arma titles.  This game is massive. With gigantic maps, lots of venicles and weapons you will have lots of fun. Gameplay is more fluid than previous game. Graphics has been improved and look gorgeous and performes nicely. There are lots of problems with CPU optimalization which can be fixed by startup command but still should be considered. Also there are tons of bugs but considering scale of things in this title it can be understood. As previous instalments Arma 3 comes with editor and is fully modable.  There is new stance adjustment system which is pretty usefull in close combat. But glitches in PhysX, not giving highly requested features in game and so on are serious problem which however can be fixed in patches.  You will not receive lots of missions like in previous titles but on workshop you can find lots of high quality mission which should compensate this.  In whole i recomend to buy Arma 3 if you want tactical game which can be incredibly rewarding and punishing at the same time. It still fells like original Operation Flashpoint but also fells lot improved.  For new players: Game plays lot diferently than other games. You must think how to aprouch enemy and so on. Run n' gun is not going to work here. You must think in this game.  English is not my native language and therefore i apologize for all my mistakes in this review.

1386	1	a	awesome game! so addictive
4348	1	a	Played a little, was OK...
319	1	a	This game's review has had a long time coming from me honestly.  The single most played game within my Steam collection is undoubtly Arma 3. It is one of the few games I play that I continue to come back to over and over again.  I won't go into much of the stuff you can read about online through professional reviews; stuff like the mechanics, graphics, etc. What I will go over though is why exactly this game is a gym despite any short comings and why it has such a loyal community.  Arma is a game that scales with your imagination. While not necessarily easy, users can create whatever mod they want for this game. Just recently I saw a video for a T-Rex mod. T-Rex aside, many of the modders for this game take it upon themselve to implement items and equipment into the game that the developers could not (most likely for legal purposes/trademarks). Missions are made constantly so there is never a worry of running out of something to do in Arma 3.  With one of the largest maps, realistic ballistics, and a sometimes brutally hard AI, the game provides a sandbox for players to play whatever military simulation they could every desire. Games can be designed to have a small 4 man team infiltrating small enemy camps or they can be designed to have huge operations with several platoons, armored vehicles, and airsupport.  My only warning would be to take your time learning the game and the modding community. When I first purchased Arma 2, I didn't play it for a year after my initial play through because I didn't quite 'get' the game. My brother also was not a fan of Arma 3 at first. This is a game you need to Google and learn about. The rewards are definitely worth the time.
2469	1	a	I really do like this game, as it has open world maps, tons of content, mods, stuff like that. I recommend this game because of all the features it has its overall a great game. 1 problem, fix the optimization! I honestly have a pretty decent graphics card but from what ive read no matter what kind of computer you have its just not gonna work out @ 60fps. Ultra settings: NOPE! Very High: NOPE! High: NOPE! Medium: NO WTF IS THIS BS? Low: YES WTFFFFFFFF! no one really wants to play a game that utterly looks like a pile of trash, you know what i mean? Everyone says this game has poor optimization. even if you have a super computer still doesnt work? what is this B.S? all you need to need to do is update it for better fps so that no one needs a NASA computer to run this game Ultra 1080P @60fps.
2053	1	a	Is nais geim, many fun playing many hours yes.
2973	1	a	I really liked this one from the first minute I joined the game. If you like: Playing with your squad, tactics, battle, action, teamwork, etc... --&gt; THIS IS YOUR GAME! &lt;--  And I am not going to talk about the gifted community we got that are making amazing content for all of us.  What I personally recommend: KOFH (King of the hill), Arma 3 Exile, Arma 3 Overpoch.  Don't forget to buy this game with your beloved once! And if u dont have any, you will make sum! ;)
3592	1	a	Very realistic and addictive, now give me my  community badge!  Steam Awards Nomination Committee 2016 badge!
1931	1	a	You can play as a rabbit.
3671	1	a	what can i say ? this game has endless things to do i highly would suggest this game.
350	1	a	Arma 3 is one of the most versatile mil-sim games out there. The support from the developers alone puts this game at the top of any mil-sim list. The vanilla AI are pretty over-powered for what they do. They can get non-stop headshots from 600m away. But a couple AI mods and they react much more realistically. Coming from Arma2, this is game a huge improvement. The addition of PhysX adds a lot to gameplay. Overall, I'm very impressed with the game. Add the developer modding support, and this game is the top of my list.
1410	1	a	wud reccommend 10/10 wud sex this game
5034	1	a	The quintessential first person military sim for the seasoned military shooter fan or first-person shooter players looking for a bit of depth and substance in a game.  This aint arcadey casual rambo CoD or Battlefield rubbish folks. This is the real-world modelled experience every FPS player *should* be looking for. And if you haven't been... you need to take a long hard look in the mirror and tell yourself to lay off the drugs.
3223	1	a	its a good game :)
362	1	a	10/10 - Insane, real life survival  I'm not good at this game, but I really love it. It's as close to real survival as you can get. Multiplayer will get the heart pumping. It's a dog eat dog kinda place though. Other players will murder you, steal from you, tie you up and call you names. Be ready to get betrayed. BRING YOUR OWN FRIENDS!   So many mods and online servers. There is something for everyone in this game. As a bonus the Single player is really fun too!  This game is truely worth the price. $50-60. Buy it.     Accidently Reviewed
2213	1	a	This game has so many servers and mods how can anyone hate it. I bought all the DLC as well. Everyone should give this a try. If you think I am going to type out a full review... well no one man. It would be so long it would be like wrighting book. So many vechiles, so many weapons, so many pieces of gear. So much stuff! It should get the âWHOOOAAAAAAA, DUDE!â AWARD.
4347	1	a	prety col game
3377	1	a	Played a little, was fun.
2189	1	a	I love it. End. Have some hours
2976	1	a	10/10 would shoot in game again.
4314	1	a	Very good game has very good graphics and very good game play and very good shoot outs. I really recommend this game to everyone
2208	1	a	Amazing in every way
1958	1	a	10/10 look boodyful would bang. It is fun, cool, and I have fun playing it, but pretty boring by yourself I would try and get into a group of players to play with or join a gang on a good altis life server, you get the idea play with others it's even better.
3662	1	a	Fairly realistic military game, controls are hard to learn, many gamemodes to suit different people. There are servers ranging from mil-sim to DayZ type servers (Exile), to GTA style servers and King of the Hill games. The Apex expansion is very good, adding a new interesting, detailed map.  A3 Launcher can be used to easily install mods, but it does not work for some people.  It's reccommended to have a good group of friends to play with.
1718	1	a	Negative reviews: DIS GAME ISNT OPTIMIZED  *Proceeds to run game on a Mac.*  Oh yeah, this game is   Horribly   Optimized.
1496	1	a	Arma tree
5380	1	a	Bad Optimization but I can't say whole is bad.
664	1	a	i can rub my â¥â¥â¥ on the rug like my dog does 10/10 would rub again.
1048	1	a	If you were to buy this game today, with no DLC or Mods, or anything of the sort, you can easily get hudreds of hours of enjoyable playtime. That's all with just Vanilla Arma. You see, the thing is though, this game has never been about the vanilla experience. This game is about experimenting with new mods and joining a community and experiecing some of the best virtual days of your life with the person to your left and to your right. Alone, this game is amazing, but with the millions of free mods? Priceless.
2444	1	a	Its just Arma thats all
4875	1	a	Two thumbs up
3480	1	a	Amazing! Even though you will not play with our Modern Weapons(You get Future-ish) the campaign is still worthy to play and the vehicles finally has a neat suspension. 9.5/10
320	1	a	If Call of Duty is a Hollywood 'military porn' movie, and Battlefield is the docudrama on military subjects, Arma is the trip down to the local military base, spending time on the range and on the obstacle course, and learning the real deal from the real people. Its about as close as you can get without signing up.  Arma 3 is a sandbox infantry simulator with a focus on authenticity, set in a near-future ficticious scenario of 2035, wherein NATO is but a shadow of its former (aka: current-day) self, and a new enemy of Iranian origin begins a localized takeover of a small collection of islands in the Agean Sea, leading to a potential 'flashpoint' of a wider war between NATO-allied nations near the Medittereanean and the Iranian-led 'CSAT' forces, with Greek-based freedom fighters and the Greek army caught inbetween.  There is a large focus (stemming from 4 games prior, not including expansions) on realism, and not the Hollywood 'realism' that Call of Duty or Battlefield would throw at you. This game has proper modelling of terminal ballistics (range, ballistics drop, penetration, deflection, windage), proper modelling of the kilometers of distances you'll oftentimes have to travel, proper weapons, vehicles, and equipment modelling and mechanics, and proper tactics and strategy implementation.  How proper? Well the seminal game of the series, let alone this infantry simulator genre, was the penultimate 'Operation Flashpoint' of 2001 (now named Arma: Cold War Assault), which led to the development of the Virtual Battlespace 1 and 2 interactive training simulator aids that are currently being used by world militaries around the world, alongside the next games in the series (with the new name), Armed Assault (or Arma).  Whilst there is a singleplayer campaign of due note (and one that is highly recommendable to newcomers to the series as the campaign since Arma 1 has always been structured to deliver a solid singleplayer experience at the same time introduce and teach the fundamental mechanics of the game), the real focus of the game is in its sandbox nature, allowing a very fanatic and vibrant community to create missions of all kinds, oftentimes with a multiplayer bent, for the game. Many of these missions are in the Steam Workshop, a first for the series.  The multiplayer aspect of this game is extensive and ranges from straight-up 'hardcore' simulation fanatics, exercising proper military procedures, tactics, and actions, to GTA-like -Life servers, Wasteland (read: DayZ in Arma), and everything in between (Insurgency, and Domination/Invade&amp;Annex). In fact, many of the aformentioned gameplay types are all community-born, with the different communities that play Arma oftentimes having vastly different variants of each type, with many having a lot of bleed-over into each other, or being a singular experience on their own. One's multiplayer experiences are oftentimes directly tied to the quality of the people that share the same experience with you, and Arma's many communities are a notch above the expected grade, with all kinds from laid-back to straight-up, oftentimes with people who are former and even current serving military. You wont feel alone if you look around, and the people you will find are of all kinds, many for the better.  This game is highly recommended to those who feel that Battlefield is not a solid enough experience and want to get deeper into the mindset of a soldier in a more authentic worldspace, and want to see how and why military tactics of today work they way they work, from close-quarters battle (CQB) in room clearing, to urban MOUT combat and open areas, to infantry - mechanized - armor - air interplay and supports.
1017	1	a	Playing this by yourself and not working together with others this game is quite boring but if you have friends to play with all kinds of fun can be had good game not great but good
3771	1	a	The best words to describe this game are incredible. I've played Arma 3 for quite a while now, a total of about 1410 hours now, and it is definetly one of the best games that I've ever played, if not the best.  Like shooters? Arma 3  Like Roleplay? Arma 3  Like Strategy? Arma 3  Like MilSims? Arma 3  This game offers it all!!
1825	1	a	Its a really good game :)
3584	1	a	plz give me this game i love this game
5312	0	a	Such a great military simulator you can't turn your head around in a car to look around where are you supposed to go... A Z-category shooter but you still have to use controls like if it would be StarCraft. I don't play an FPS to use my whole keyboard to issue broken commands. Don't buy this game. For a strategy game there's only horribly-done strategy elements, and for an FPS there's horribly done FPS elements in it. For squads and commanders, buy Battlefield or any other non-garbage tactical shooter, this game is just bad.
3869	1	a	One day in Wasteland Sandbox, I found a car. Picked up the gun inside, and got in. Crashed into a small rock, entire car blew up. 11/10
2	1	a	Great game!...Warthunder also think it is a great game!
1620	1	a	One of the best games I have played in a long time. In the past week I have played this game ATLEAST 10 hours a day. It is hard to get used to if you are coming from a different FPS but once you get about 15 hours in the game you should be ok. The game gets even better when you have friends to play it with. this is one of the few games that I think is worth the $60 (even though I bought it for $40 with all the DLC).
902	1	a	If youÂ´re looking for a game thats both realistic and fun at the same time then this is the game for you.
1725	1	a	If you're into military simulation and/or huge moddability (and therefore hundreds of gamemodes as Altis Life, Breaking Point, etc.) this is the game for you.  I love the crap out of this game but I give it a 8/10 because there's still a LOT of room for optimization.
3845	1	a	Im-...Im actually really stuck for words. My computer isn't even a gaming laptop and I can still play Arma 3 with my mates. This game makes me feel mixed emotions of-... OF JOY! This game is so awesome and the detail put in OMG, the game is a BIG part of my life now. I actually feel as if I am part of the army, thank you for allowing this game to be made. Its. So . GOOD!
5409	1	a	Its like Arma 2, exept this one has graphics.
3091	1	a	10/10 i really like this
4453	1	a	I mistaken a rock for a car. 11/10
5333	1	a	Great Combat simulator however realistic vehicle damage and pysics is highly lacking. Oh and make sure you have a good pc otherwise expect 15 frames.
1715	1	a	booty
952	1	a	If you mess up on the campaign, you have to go waaay back to try again, so I wouldn't recommend this game if you'll buy it for the campain. Multiplayer is pretty nice, one of those games you have to wait 20 minutes to see your opponent's body, and still you won't shoot, because it will attract others. Very nice, you ought to think fast it you want to be the best. Totally recommend.
898	1	a	I could tell you all about this game after near 800hrs (790hr at the time of writing).. but I won't because I don't want any Call of Duty or Battlefield Fanboys coming in and â¥â¥â¥â¥ing up my game :) - I mean, really i should tell you to buy it because the only thing Arma shares with CoD and BF is that you shoot people..OK well CoD I haven't liked since Modern Warfare 2 and BF I grew out of as it was a good series that basically just got â¥â¥â¥â¥ all over by big companies seeking quick profits. Anyway Arma on the otherhand has been around just as long as these two but perhaps didn't spend so much on its marketing campaign and put more of its budget into making their games? I can't say for sure, but if you're into realism (not photorealism, like you call of duty spastics) and Military Simulation types whether it be Tank Sims, Combat Flight Sims or just good old fashioned FPS types of games, you're probably going to enjoy some part of ArmA.. Thats one group of people that could enjoy this, then theres the creative types.. Have you ever wanted to drop a Fishing Trawler from 20,000ft onto an Airport runway filled with fuel trucks, planes, helicopters, tanks, cars whatever you fancy, just for fun.. to test your PC's capacity or performance? you can do this. Have you ever thought of a scenario and wanted to see how it might play out with two or more opposing factions in some kind of freaky multi-national royal rumble in the middle of nowhere with armour, air and infantry forces going at each other ? I know I never did until I played with the Mission editor in Arma 2, I played around making small missions in the previous games but not really until arma 3 did i experiment with weird â¥â¥â¥â¥ like that.. it's quite fun for wasting time, and it looks great..   Anyway, you guys could keep reading or you could be downloading it as you read.. its worth whatever the price is at the moment.. I don't really care how much it is, it's worth it. I've been playing this series since 2001 in the very beginning back when it was a Codemasters game Operation Flashpoint.. â¥â¥â¥â¥ing awesome game. If you're currently in the military, plan to enlist in the future or have previously served and want realism - buy Arma.. join a tactical realism clan or milsim group depending on your preference.. they're both the same to me.. immersive groups are best.  **Warning** not so much a warning, but if you have PTSD and are triggered easily, perhaps this isn't your thing having PTSD myself I can safely say, this game will scare the absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of you occasionally, depending on how you play and what triggers you or maybe just ease into it I can't tell you not to get it, it's an awesome game.. just try to remember that it's just a game. Easier said than done in some cases like mine.. I couldn't play properly for a week but that's another story that I don't think you need to know about ha.. Best game ever - possibly not best storyline, I liked Arma 2's campaign better but everything else in Arma 3 is â¥â¥â¥â¥ING AWESOME! - Don't take my word for it though, try it out - oh did I mention upto 64 player online multiplayer coop, pvp etc and thousands of servers internationally (I'm Australian and even we have low ping servers to â¥â¥â¥â¥ around on).. ahh I think that's it.. I chose not to technically review the game because it doesn't need a review, there are plenty out there just don't go with any saying anything negative about it, there's very few things that I don't like about it.. and the list gets smaller each day with the devs constantly releasing new fixes or DLC buy this game, I bought it in it's Alpha stage and the list of bugs was relatively small back then so you can imagine what it's like now after having been out officially over a year now ;-)
1399	1	a	Arma 3 is an awesome game that I play often
3293	1	a	Amazing Game Love It, Can Be Rage Inducing at times, but in the end its all for good times, and good memories. 10/10
5011	1	a	I would recommend this game to CoD players
2971	1	a	You can basically do anything that you want.
167	0	a	This is a review for the Single Player Experience.  As I have a busy life, I donât enjoy the MP side of this game. Most of the adoration you hear about this game is solely the MP community. Most of the cool videoâs you see on YouTube are made by and for the MP guys. And they can only get those shots with real people, as the AI is utter â¥â¥â¥â¥.  PROS: Beautiful graphics. Value. Moding community. Be Careful. A lot of the mods will degrade your game to the point of it being unplayable and it will take a full uninstall/reinstall to get working right again.  CONS: BUGS/GLITCHES/CRASHES NIGHTLY!!! STILL AFTER 3 YEARS!  In the editor, never merge SP missions. They will never work.  In the Eden editor, if you click Play/SP with Briefing, and then in the briefing you click on Cancel, that mission will never, EVER work right again. You will have to start from scratch.  AI. Legendarily Horrible. I can only assume it is on purpose. There is no way this AI could be real. It has to be some perverted experiment.  Mission Planning. Doesnât exist. You will have to find a MOD. See above. You will have to learn, I canât believe I am writing this, you have to learn a script in order to make your own missions. Something they forgot to tell you on website/box/adverts/videos. JOKE!  Command and Control. Joke.  Communications. Joke.  Game Value. Low.  Simulation Value. Non-Existent.  Technology: It is supposed to be the year 2035! JOKE. The tech in this game is more like 1955.  Conclusion: The only redeeming qualities of this game are; Potential. Someday, this game might be good. And it is the only game of its kind. But they spend all of their (BIS) limited talent on areaâs we donât care about. FIX the AI. Make this game playable for SP. Basics. Do some research!   DONâT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A REALISTIC MILITARY SIMULATION! This isnât it! You will literally spend 50% of your time scripting. 45% fighting the game AI/GUI, and 5% fighting the enemy.  Good Luck!
2858	1	a	Top quality army simulator
1643	1	a	Goodbye life! Takes time to learn but is very addictive! 10/10
4258	1	a	with a 6+ years of gaming.   this is the best game i played hands down.  with a realistic gamepaly and everything.   there is some bugs here and there, but let me tell you even these bugs are fun and enjoyable.   i have over 1000 hours of playing this game and i still learn new things about it.  GET THIS GAME RIGHT NOW!!!
5207	0	a	Don't buy BI games. You will regret it.
1548	1	a	Awesome Game. Love the milsim side of it. Even if its very bare-bone, the mods are what make this game great. Also the fact that the armored vehicles for the NATO troops are Israeli makes the game way more interesting since its not the same old American armor. Only bad part is the little kids that always talk in global extra loud :|  10/10 Bohemia :D
1736	1	a	What more to say? Coming back to this from a few years away and it's great to see how its developed. Being a fan from Arma, Arma 2 and even VBS 2, you can't go wrong with checking this out. But there are conditions: you have to love the milsim side of life, you can do ANYTHING. You have to persevere also. You will die. Again and again... This game will suck you in. Big time....
926	1	a	I recommend this game. It's currently my favorite tactical shooter.
657	1	a	Many hours of fun and a plethora of gamemodes. Definately buy it if your PC can handle it.
3340	1	a	I really recommend this game because of its nice graphics, great Singleplayer/Multiplayer. I got the Arma 3 Limited Deluxe Edition for $55,47. It contains Arma 3, a map of Altis and Stratis, an awesome keycard, ARMA: Cold War Assault, a keyboard layout, a digital soundtrack, a digital tactical guide, digital maps and all DLCs. For its price it is just a bargain. Buy it and you won't regret! :)
1759	1	a	Online multiplayer:   Me: 'under fire' Friend: 'Where from!?' Me:'I dont know....Ummm (Checking compass bearing)....Oh doesnt matter im dead' Friend: 'oh ok'  Awesome game with huge diversity, play as a team for best experience, only probelm with this game is that the online servers can sometimes have really terrible fps with your pc, even if you have a good rig.
3722	1	a	Once you taste ARMA 3, there's no going back to games like Battlefield and Call of duty.   You have ascended the stairs to adulthood.
2012	1	a	Never again will I paly arma 3 campaign the gun recoil is terrible and the AI are way to over powerd it is shocking campaign  and it needs to be sorted
3896	1	a	I don't even own this game. Why is it asking me for my review?
317	1	a	Buy it. Now. Join 11th AMB, install mods. Have infinite fun.
2250	1	a	this is very amazing game! , you guys should buy it !!!
2197	1	a	Best game I have played so far.  Wanting Tactial Combat? BOOM AI missions and set-up war servers.  Wanting RP? BOOM Altis Life or Life mod. (Mod is more sophisticated RP)  Wanting straight-up PVP? BOOM Exile, Epoch, Sector control, the options are limitless.  Wanting to just mess around with friends? BOOM AI Missions.    Generally an amazing game.   Addictive though, be careful.
2475	1	a	its â¥â¥â¥â¥in â¥â¥â¥â¥ m8 wont run on my 1987 computer my friends are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ for buying a 60 dollar game thats 2 years old id rather â¥â¥â¥â¥ in my own urethra and â¥â¥â¥â¥ that â¥â¥â¥â¥ back into my own â¥â¥â¥. its not the worst tho.
5164	0	a	Just get Arma 2 Combined Operations.
2929	1	a	With many fun laughs to be had, and memories to be shared, this is a great game (so as long as you have friends to play with). While a terrible single player expierience, due to extreme boredom and blandness, it is terrific in multiplayer.
3301	1	a	You want endless fun?  GET THIS GAME
4420	1	a	The best and biggest milsim sandbox out there. If you're a fan of PC gaming, this should be in your library.
3388	1	a	So once you've figured out what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ you're doing you'll like this game, if not then go play some Call of Duty.
815	1	a	This is a great military simulator, this game is the closest thing that you get to realism
180	1	a	Get the â¥â¥â¥â¥ off Side!
2325	1	a	Outstanding military simulator like its predecessor, but be warned of its poor optimization as it will bring even the best gaming rigs to its knees.
4059	1	a	ive played it a few times. its okay
5260	0	a	  I played the free trial period for the weekend when the game was put on sale. I'm glad it was a free trial period. The first thing I, personally, didn't like was the time that this is supposed to be taking place. I'm sure that twenty years from now, the weapons systems, aircraft, gear, etc., will be more advanced than those portrayed in the game. The game's weapons systems, gear, etc., are obselete and are the currently utilitzed systems. Why not have the game take place in a more recent time?  Secondly, I wasn't too impressed with the movement, especially for vehicles. Seemed 'clunky' and a little old-school. I tried that mouse maneuvering of a vehicle which wasn't much better. I'm sure it would take practice, but my initial impressions weren't what I expected from a game that seems to receive a good rating.  Lastly, even though I palyed through the 'tutuorial,' there was still way too much guessing involved as to what keys or combination of keys were required to do whatever it was that needed to get done. Many of which could have been easily implemented into the tutorial so you could start off playing the game and know what keys do what. Very frustrating to say the least.  However, I like the idea of the game and the open environment. The graphics aren't the best but certainly acceptable. Sure, I only played this game for a few hours but my first impressions didn't live up to the expectations I thought I would see with a game rated the way it is. This, in my own opinion, is a game that should be on the $10 clearance rack at Walmart. Thank you for the free trial, but I'm going to pass on this one.
4324	1	a	This Game is probably the best game ive ever owned and yes i have low hours cuse this is my second account, I have about 700+ hours total! but i gotta say if youre pc isent good youre gonna have a predy bad time :,(
1800	1	a	Are you bored of Call Of Duty and Battlefield or CS:GO? U want to feel like real soldier? This game is for you!  Good things -Simulator -A lot of mods  -Nice community -Character costumisation kind of -Campaign, about 20 missions -Multiplayer with lots of game modes created by us, players -A lot of mods!!  Bad Things -Very good PC needed -Physics you are drunk go home -Not many Vehicles -Not many factions and weapons -New dlc costs 25 euros  8/10 in my oppinion.
4716	1	a	So epic I want it so bad
447	1	a	Comparable to minecraft in its diversity and modability while maintaining a smooth and beautiful mechanic and graphic theme. Endless options for modding but also includes a campaign and scenarios for people uninterested in mods. Once you've played Arma 3, all First Person Shooters seem to be lacking depth. I highly recommend this game.
1517	1	a	this game rocks!
4910	1	a	Rate 9/10  Hi there!Personally i believe that all Arma series games are just perfect and they deserve every single dollar you pay for them.Very nice graphics,Ultimate battle simulation,mods supported,perfect gameplay and much more.... the only minus is the poor optimazation in some PC's... that they dont have a decent cpu-gpu combination....
4623	1	a	DON'T PLAY WITH JOHN COS HES A FK-ING LYING PIKEY TW@T SRSLY
2130	1	a	Despite my few hours, I do believe I am an american soldier
82	1	a	I was talking to a guy in a courtyard and a helicopter squished him. So I stole his gear.  10/10
2784	1	a	Best War Simulator so far after Arma 2! If you love sim, or maybe you love realistic system, or maybe you just love to setup your own epic movie scene, this is the game for you! :D  SIMPLY THE BEST
4202	0	a	I ran a few different programs to give me a idea of what settings I could run it at and all of them told me ultra. Started it up and tried running it on ultra; couldn't even break 10FPS. I then worked my way down on settings, all combos and still didn't break 25-30 FPS. Tried looking up performance tweaks and still no improvement. The game itself could be great, but it can't seem to run on some high-end pcs so it was just a clossal waste of $ for me. It seems that 2yrs post-release that Bohemia would have resolved some if not all the performance issues by now....
2453	1	a	I THINK IT IS A EPIC GAME 
329	1	a	No point having a huge review, if you've not heard of ARMA by now then you're likely not the target audience.  If you have heard of it and you're on the fence - Get the game when it's cheap if you must, but you will not regret it if you take the time to learn the basics. Unlimited replayability, amazing potential. Typical lifespan for a game like this is 10yrs + (People still make mods for OFP) so you can easily get your moneys worth.  Enjoy!
1708	1	a	great game

2589	1	a	If someone is looking for a military shooter where they want:  1. To make their own Campaigns 2. Experience Realism as well as absurdity 3. Mod Support 4. Replay Value  This game is for you.
1561	1	a	This isn't optimized, So you're gonna run it in low graphics if you want fps. But â¥â¥â¥â¥ it, This is arma, one of the best games of simulation that exists. Nothing better than put a guillie suit on and hunt 'dears' They simply don't get where the shot came from. It really doesn't add up to them 'cause they think they're invulnerable, they actually aren't.... Helicopters, tanks, snipers and whatnot will hunt you, but if you're evil at your class in this case sniper, They'll not find you, They'll fear you, hate you and hunt you back...Not to mention you can add mods to it, which make it better. I'm biased to say this 'cause my favorite style of playing is sniper but... Now back to its cons, The biggest failing of this game in my opinion is not being optimized 'cause there's no excuse for that, you know there's a myriad of games with huge maps that are optimized and you can clock them easily. Hope the company that's made this game come out an update to optimize it, or at least optimize the next arma. You know if you guys really do it, the next arma should be named 'the revolution of wars' Get it? The revolution of wars(Fps) Nevermind. After all, Awesome game!!
2683	1	a	Love This Game Soo Much &lt;3
2271	1	a	Solid single player campaign so far, and the multitude of community missions means your hard pressed to run out of new missions to play. But this game really shines when it comes to large coop missions.  I also recommend Sa-Matra's version of the Wasteland mission over the others.
4090	1	a	I like this game because it feels realstic and feels like your actually in the game.
2187	1	a	First of all, This game is amazing!  The graphics; fantastic. The amount of 'stuff' to do; outstanding. The ability to run well on low end PC's; Ehh... Anyways, this is Arma 3. It is a military shooter, which captured the realism of anything from Infantry Firefights to Drone warfare, and CAS runs.   Pros:  -Looks amazing on high graphics  -Amount of 'Stuff' to do; amazing  -Modibility; 11/10 there are some amazing mods!! -Community is Fairly decent -A lot of effort put into this game as far as mechanics. -Endless fun with friends -All of the controls!!  Cons: -All of the Controls!!  -!!!MAJOR LEARNING CURVE!!!! (as far as how to drive, fly, shoot, range targets, list goes on!) -CPU and MRAM are a Major key to how well this game plays.  (Basically, the CPU, AND MRAM are what make this game playable. With a good i7, and 32 gigs of Ram, I was able to get 60 fps on Ultra settings with low terrain, and minimal post processing effects at 1080p [When I did not have GPU Yet; I now have a 980ti, and it still can be a bit buggy] But if you want good terrain, FXAA, Post processing, HDR, Bloom, All that good stuff, you must have a vary good GPU!!!!)  -Somewhat poorly optimized on multiplayer servers mainly. Singleplayer, peice of cake!  -Must have good Computer!!!! -Very Time consuming. Like...... A lot.... I have 1,000 hours, and Idk how.  -DLC Watermarks &gt;:(  Anyways, if you are even remotely considering of buying this game, DO IT!! If you do, GET THE APEX DLC!!!! It is the best DLC out of all of them, but the map it adds is difficult to run, even for me. (980ti) but looks amazing!!! Hope this helped you out a bit. This is my opinion on the game...... Its good! 
3852	1	a	ArmA 3 is a must have for any shooter fan that enjoys open-ended possibilities. With several mods now available (hence the reason I'm changing my review) there are just so many things that you can do it's not even funny. Co-op missions are fun, getting with a larger group and doing an MCC or Zeus mission is just ridiculously fun, and the campaign is still solid.  If you prefer PvP, there are a lot more modes out now than when I originally wrote the review. King of The Hill is the only one I've really played and it's not really my jam, but hey, if it is yours then go for it.   The game is fairly well optimized at this point, but really poorly optimized MP servers are extremely noticable and when bad scripting is done, it's even more noticable. This game on an SSD is a pretty intelligent decision.  With or without mods, there is just a ton that you can do with this game. If you're at all into large scale operations or even long-lasting missions on a smaller scale, you NEED this game. Point blank.
3897	1	a	Great game. IMO, more realistic than Arma 2, better graphics engine. I was able to run it in 1600x960p. Recoil is not that of a damn Barrett .50 cal when you are shooting a pistol. Cooler story and just overall an advancement from Arma 2. OP AF
4322	0	a	Didn't even launch multiplayer once, and I am banned. Battleye - The Anticheat Gold Standard
90	1	a	I thought I would put this out there during the Christmas sale.  You have no better time than now to buy this game. For the price of the Apex expansion alone, you can get Arma 3, Apex expansion, and the DLC bundle. $70 worth of content for $35. From the 3 hours I have played, it is worth it.  If you're considering Arma 3, definitely consider it NOW during the sale.  I'll write a proper review of this game once I put in a few more hours. I've only experienced single player so far.
42	1	a	Ã am Portuguese and of course I choose the Portuguese empire! I sailed to south america and I invade their lands! I killed them, I stole their resources(land, food, gold and wood)! And after been proud of the things I did, I build a new civilization called Brazil.   Review: 10/10 Very realistic!
1566	1	a	250 hours and I still haven't experienced a properly functioning game. ;) 10/10 would glitch again
1137	1	a	This is a must have for any realism, strategy, or FPS player. I strongly recommend it to everyone!
2591	1	a	Action packed game. (it Works best when you are in a comunity) Come joing  IGGHQ.com  TS:  eu.igghq.com 
612	1	a	Great game, its very fun but it would be best to play with a mic (multiplayer). They also have some great mods
2363	1	a	Much improved over Arma II. Loads of downloadable content especially for multiplayer/co-op. The AI is smart enough so that each scenario is not exactly the same every time. On the down side, development seems to be a bit slow. There are still some glitches, and patches aren't released regularlly. Some of the keystrokes take some getting used to. If you are using mouse/keyboard, do yourself a favor and practice flying the helos before attempting to use them in missions.  4/5 stars.... with potential! Loads of fun to play
4236	1	a	Arrested for cooking meth  10/10
1670	1	a	This game is a greate game if you are a fan of tacticalality. I would say it is one of the most tactical games out in the stean market. The worlds are massive and the gameplay is fun. I definately recommend this game.

4235	1	a	This is the future of war games.   All it needs now is interactive cockpits for the aircraft, tanks, and other vehicles but the modding community is superb.   There's bound to be something for you in Arma. It's not JUST war and guns and tanks and stuff...  You can go mountain climbing, scuba diving, skydiving, and even command your own battalion of... butterflies.
1283	0	a	Why is this â¥â¥â¥ game laggy as â¥â¥â¥â¥ even on a GTX 1070 and a i7 cpu
4892	0	a	this game has constant DLC in order to play, Bohemia Interactive is becoming like EA. I could play with certain mods, and now this Apex DLC came out, I cannot use certain mods without buying the DLC. Please dont support Bohemia Interactive, as they just strive for money and not customer satisfaction
7	1	a	I remember playing this game as a child. I would come home every day hoping that my brother wasnt playing so i could play. The game only got more fun. I only had the original game and no DLCs so when i saw this game on steam 8 years later, it was obvious that i had to buy it. If you havnt played this game yet, i acctually feel bad for you.  10/10 Would 'Tuck tuck tuck' again.
4757	1	a	I swam for 30 minutes and the black man ran over by boat.
5095	0	a	I was a fan of the ArmA series. I really played ArmA II totally grey.. But I had high hopes for ArmA III buying the alpha , promising us more stuff will be added later...  Yes that part is true.. ArmA III on itself is totally empty... You have to get Mods and Payable DLC content to make the game interesting... It is like they gave you the engine of the car only.. You have to pay for the wheels , chassis , doors , windows , lights yourself.  It is suppose to be MilSim , in order to have that label , it should give us also.   What made me being so disappointed about ArmA III... It is that the Helicopter DLC costs 12 euro.. Like WTF
2088	1	a	A1 10/10- a guy with 420 hours on the game B)
74	1	a	when you begin: you will get rekt. you will forget what keys to use. you will try to quickscope. you will try to kill teammates. you will create a character with outfits that make absolutely no sense but you won't even know. you will try to spot enemies. you will try to charge in on your own. you will try to change the buttons but you will most likely fail. you will get banned for no reason.  but remember, it will be worth it because you're gonna turn into a fine warrior.
673	1	a	Best shooter I've ever played.
221	1	a	Best military simulation game there is in my opinion. Specially when you playing with a unit or big group  10/10
193	1	a	This game is like Gravy flavoured Ice Cream, some like it, others love it. If you hate it, go and force feed it to yourself until you're in one of those categories. But seriously, go and try some Gravy flavoured Ice Cream.
2244	1	a	This game is amazing! If you've played Arma 2 then you know what Arma is all about. If you havent then let me enlighten you. The Arma series is a 3rd and 1st person combat simulator with unlimited game modes such as Breakingpoint, Dayz, Altis Life, and normal seize and secure objective missions. Jump in with millions of players and experience realism like never before. And for all the fans of Call of Duty and the Battlefield Franchise your in luck because this game has campain for you to enjoy with no 360 no scope â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. Strategize, Compromise, and Defeat your enemies one by one in this tactically realistic military simulator. Worth every penny!

1304	1	a	I love Arma 3 ....and the game is amazing... but isn't it time for the bugs to get fixed ? I am tired of dying when going down the stairs...getting stuck next to rocks, getting stuck inside of rocks.... not being able to sit/lay down on a big *** flat hills/boulders ....   Release Date: 12 Sep, 2013 .... its almost 2015 ...
3374	1	a	Its a very good milsim and its big jump forwards for ArmA series.
1839	1	a	Oh yes.   Arma 3, well arma 3 with out mods is like boobs with no silicon.    Vanilla arma 3 68/100   Because the guns look stupid, but you get alot of â¥â¥â¥â¥ to do, for example altis life, king of the hill and much more. But when you install the mods RHS and taskforce radio and some custom maps the game gets the real feeling. + Join a community then it's heaven     With mods i would say 88/100
1375	1	a	Very fun game, I get some fps lag in cities, but overall, its too fun to set down.
560	1	a	Great game. Lots of popular mods, great modding community, will be around for a long time.
5218	1	a	This game has a massive emphasis on realism. That means the graphics are realistic. And everyone knows realistic graphics need a good graphics card for a computer. And everyone knows they need a good computer to have a good graphics card.  
3331	1	a	Great modern warfare simulator that is completely brutal and unforgiving, make sure your PC can run the game before you buy, as it does have reasonably high requirements
2696	1	a	Played a bit, really enjoyed it.
3502	1	a	Awesome game, pick up a copy if you've haven't already, prices seem to drop quite well. Tonnes of mod support and new gamemodes coming out, its definitely worth a buy if you've played things like DarkRP, and Battlefield in my opinion. :)
4677	1	a	A true life like of experience of war is to be had in this game  Certainly the conflicts of the Middle East are encapsulated in the King of the Hill servers. Driving around in your 200 dollar rented pick up truck, not really knowing where you are going, you squint awkwardly into the horizon; then you zoom in with your scope because you realize you are dumb. Seeing little dots appearing you suddenly hear the distinct crack of gun fire. Being the smallest of the three factions you barrel out knowing the overwhelming s***t flinging powers of even just a small detachment of enemies. The gunner fires wildly as the tires blow out and the car smashes into a wall. He is now dead. The passenger attempts to fix the car whilst you take over the gun, firing randomly into the distance until the shooting stops  The car is fixed, you are still alive. You make it into town and rendezvous with your comrades. The truck stops as an rpg slams into it, exploading and killing all inside. You are dead. You respawn and do it all again.
2169	1	a	just as you think you cant blow anything else up, you suddenly realise, that there is another town to blow up as well
3747	1	a	One of the best games out there ! With the amount of missions / mods out there.. the game will never end.

133	1	a	Within 24 hours of buying this game, I have played 14.2 hours. I'm pretty sure it's good
1354	1	a	Good game to play, single or multiplayer. plenty to do in it.
3137	1	a	Just from playing this game alone, I could probably fly a helicopter better than I can drive a car.
4967	0	a	Possibly the worst game created so far, even compared to really â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ indie titles. This game was never optimized for a computer from the look of things. If you run intel anything you'll be fine, but god forbid that you run AMD you'll get 0-20 fps no matter what situation. The developers for this game are autistic â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ who have clearly never cared for gameplay in anything, sure you can argue 'It's a simulator, not a game' but it's still a 'Military Simulator'. There is no effort for gunplay whatsoever in this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥torm of a simulator. All the guns feel the same, bullets never connect where they're supposed to, you run around feeling clunky as â¥â¥â¥â¥ shooting nerf guns at nothing.   TL;DR Pros: It's a game  Cons: It's a really â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game Low/nonexistant FPS â¥â¥â¥â¥ gunplay Models are ugly Server list sucks  Just about every game out there is better than this â¥â¥â¥â¥, and that's terrible seeing as there's a full dev team that made this.  Just take your $60 and spend it elsewhere, that's all there is to it.
4162	1	a	Best war game ever, its that simple.
2731	1	a	This game is very fun to play with freinds and is worth the time and money i spent on arma 3 huge success and many opportunities to come.
2264	1	a	There is nothing quite like this game when you are in a full scale firefight, exchanging rounds, helicopters flying over head, your squadmates moving to flank the other team. You aren't alone in this battlefield though, many other firefights could be taking place anywhere on the map. You have free range to go where ever you'd like on the maps which are HUGE. Be forwarned though, you'll want to either ride or drive a vehicle if you have to run anywhere over a couple kilometers. Another warning that this game is NOT like Call of Duty, or Battlefield. It has a much more realistic feeling and is much harder, doesn't have an rpg system of leveling up, and you there isn't a scoreboard. That being said when you pull of something tactical with your squad, or do a combined strike with your team it is so rewarding and fun. There are mods for those of you that don't like just the base game. I haven't played breaking point, but I believe it is much like DayZ (a zombie survival mod with perma-death). There is also king of the hill, wasteland, and a few other things. I mostly play the game for multiplayer, but there is a mission editor to make missions, or to just spawn stuff and fight. There is also an episodic campaign that BI is releasing. Mod tools have just recently been released. The game is early in it's life and is going to hit full stride in a matter of months. If you want to see what's capable check out how ARMA 2 is now. Now on to opinions of techincal things.   The sounds in this game are amazing, and the graphics are also phenomenal for such large maps. The lighting is crazy good especially at night. The physics are a little iffy, and there are quite a few bugs. This is to be expected with such a large world though. This is the only game where I actually jump when I get shot at, and find myself instinctly ducking at my computer. There are only two maps, Altis and Stratis. The enviroments have a great mixture from grasslands and forests to villages or cities. In terms of content ARMA 2 has much more, but I believe as the game starts to get older the community and BI will start releasing A LOT more stuff. ARMA 3's urban fighting is awesome. I love it, but ARMA 2 does long engagements better I think. The game is pretty demanding I run it on high with a 7850 XFX Black Edition 2GB, 12 GB RAM, Phenom x6 Thuban 3.2GHz and get okay FPS. The community isn't awful like other FPS games. I love this game for the realistic, tactical, and strategic fighting that everyone has to do. There are mods for other things which makes me think this game has something for everyone.   I would recommend this game to someone who is looking for a more mature, serious, and hardcore community than most other first person shooters, as well as looking for a game that is more realistic and team based. If the person loved to play lone wolf, wanted anything they wanted in content right this second, or was easily angered by a bug here and there I wouldn't recommend it to them.   TL;DR - Graphics, Sounds, Lighting all amazing. Urban combat is better than ARMA 2. This game is for the person who wants a hyper-realistic first person shooter with heavy emphasis on team work that doesn't mind a bug here and there, and isn't bothered by waiting for more content for a little while.
3821	1	a	Best game I've ever had, imagine Garry's Mod and Battlefield had a baby, but the Battlefield part was actually good, framerate feels high yet its about 15-30, has more custom content than overwatch banned steam accounts, has scripts to make literal infinite amounts of custom scenarios to play with and HUGE amounts of mods that can either add small things or completely change how the game functions.  Total Hours says it all, buy the f****** thing!  1/10 did not pay for a good rating -IGN
3921	1	a	Great Game!!!
5278	0	a	Do Not Buy this game,  If you're in to getting a half finished game of which half of the items require a second purchase of DLC then this game is perfect for you, if not then you may want to avoid this game. It is inevitable that more and more of what should have been in the original game will be charged for.   Some basic visuals, such as the way roads link together are still not fixed along with some vehicles having animations which result in a poorer gameplay experience. If you backed them during the Alpha you will have been completely ripped off by this company and even if you did not you will be in some form. The game is still playable without the DLC but guns and helicopters should have definitely been included in the price especially for the people who have backed the company from the start.   You will find that unlike arma 2 servers are already starting to die down with great numbers of servers being taken down due to insufficient funding. Arma 2 servers never had this issue due to the large number of players on servers and the replayability of the game, yes I have a lot of hours on this game however it does not make up for the fact that it is meerely designed to squeeze money out of you. I refuse to pay for DLC which is not fairly priced for their supporters. Companies such as this one should re-evaluate their stance to the market before the PC Gaming community heavily turn against companies proposing to release large amounts of DLC. This has already been demonstrated by fans of the upcoming title 'Total War: Warhammer' where thousands disliked a video of a planned DLC in order to get their point across.   Companies will continue to take the P*ss until we take a stand against them.   
2018	1	a	So we're on a hill, there's an apc and 5 guys waiting to attack a base, i hear a truck drive up and assume its my teamamtes, boy was i wrong, i heard someone scream ALLAHU AKBAR, thats when i realised that wasnt my teammates and i had messed up... i died, cried, and respawned   ALLAHU/10 would get blown up again
2772	1	a	One of the best Fps games i have ever played! Really fun with friends.
2239	1	a	Great war simulation game ! I recommend it to all people who loves real action combat, but you might need a decent config for it.
4828	1	a	Definetely worth the money!
779	1	a	It was fun
4901	1	a	I love this game
1021	1	a	Keeping it real - Bohemia is one of very few developers making games for the PC platform. Besides beeing a very beautiful game, the frenchise is pushing the envelope and bringing you a community game - modable and keeping you, the player, the most important part of the game. On todays games-market, the ArmA experience is like no other. This game is one of the reasons why we still buy Personal Computers - cus' we like to play Personal Games :) Buy it!!
3192	1	a	A game for those operators who operate operationally in operations
104	1	a	Where the Battlefield series should have naturally progressed to; a huge multi-faceted, vehicle crammed blood bath with a fantastic community (for the most part). Thankfully this beat Battlefield to it so we don't have to deal with EA to play!
489	1	a	A3 is a great tactical army sim, has so much to do it is very hard to get bored. great community (in places) and great mods available via ArmAholic. Granted it has its bugs (like the rest) but they are slowly but surely fixing it.  9/10. Would recommend to anyone
2927	1	a	When i die im getting plugged into this game
3635	1	a	Played a bit, quite a learning curve.
2110	1	a	Buy game for $30. Launch game. Ask friend which gamemode is preferrable. Friend says TDM should be good for starters. Start playing. Get to a capture point. Staying prone, 3 people at the point, they pass by me. Be like wtf, these â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s blind and can't see me? Kill all 3. Get kicked for killing team-mates.  mfw.
2883	1	a	Highly recommend the game ! Awesome with various modes and really fun to play.  8/8 'Would buy again' - Bonito
1272	0	a	What in the name of all that is holy,is wrong with this game. Well I will tell you.  Aside from some new wepons,this is the exact same game as arma 2. The 'new' invantory system is just as terrible as the old one,and requires a 3 day class in order to understand how it operates. The way that cars trucks and tanks function is just as horrid and un-predictable as it was in arma 2. I can still do a loop-d-loop in most aircraft at under 100 yards altattude. the campain is luaghable with a bad story,bad vice acting, and filled with stupid bugs. In order to play the game you have to attend basic training,not on combat tactics or proper map reading mind you,no you need basic traning on how the heck to move,access invantory or piont your gun. 90% of the time I spend fighting the engine and bad mechanics that make the game hard to play. 10% i spend having fun shooting bad guys or working with a team compleate a great COMUNITY CREATED mod. And that brings Me to My last piont how the hell did arma get such a great comunity? They release an unfinished game,the cumminity buys it,and then finishes it for them. The only fun modes are the ones supplied by the comunity. This game is one of the worst repersentations of the FPS and tactical shooter genras.  The only reason this game is fun,is becuase the cammunity creates awesome mods,and fixes all the terrible bugs.   I rate this game 2/10
4231	1	a	This game is worth the buy. So many mods and looks so good. Just wait til a half off sale...
4896	1	a	This the tactical shooter you deserve. Buy this game along with Apex and all the add-ons.  Arma 3 doesn't dissapoint.
1037	1	a	Time well spent
812	1	a	Simulation isn't the defining aspect of Arma. It's scale.  The enormity of the map is the foundation for the experiences that distinguish Bohemia Interactive's flagship franchise. It's what makes radios, topographical maps, binoculars, and compasses practical equipment in an FPS. It's what allows for kilometer-long headshots and coordinated convoy raids. It's what makes using your eyes to spot hints of enemies--muzzle flashes, tracers, gunsmoke--as valuable as being a crack shot.  The scale of Arma 3 dwarfs everything in the genre, including Arma 2. Altis, a keyhole portion of which is seen in these screenshots, is a Mediterranean island-nation assembled from ruins, airports, coastal villages, solar power plants, military outposts, salt flats, and tank-friendly scrubland. It's a variegated backyard for you to play war in, but what's more significant is that Arma's landscape finally has the technology it deserves.
2950	0	a	Perpetually broken, Horribly unoptimized and at times unplayable. Arma 3 is a game for wannabe operators that are too out of shape and cowardly to actually fight. Don't worry though you can expect plenty of cashgrab DLC like Arma 3 Karts, or the Arma 3 Two Helicopters and the rest is free DLC, or the upcoming Arma 3 Seven Guns and a bipod feature that has been missing since release DLC.   You can't blame BIS though, it's not their fault the game runs poorly the real problem is the toxic community and their poorly ported mods that cause the game to â¥â¥â¥â¥ itself.   If you buy this half-game you can expect 100s of Altis Life RP servers, populated by 13 year old and 20 somethings that failed to launch. You could also try out one of the many KOTH servers for some low FPS deathmatches with people that can't fly, shoot, drive or communicate worth â¥â¥â¥â¥. Don't forget the DayZ knockoff servers too, or it's tired older brother wasteland.  If you are too hardcore an operator for that though you could join one of the many 'Realism Groups'. It's like being in a real army man! Some of them even give you assigned roles and make you adress eachother by rank. If you are lucky you will find one that makes you do a virtual obsticle course or bootcamp before you can join. It's like the authentic bootcamp experience only your drill sargeant is a socially â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ teenager on such a powertrip that you would think he actually believes what he is doing isn't completely â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and unnecessary. Once you are in you can look forward to a mission once a week that they will restart if something goes slightly wrong in their supremely tactical plan.  3/10
4562	1	a	i owned it once but for some reason i dont anymore i didn't refund it idk but it was cool while i had it, the campain was hard dough
3302	1	a	This game is by far the best game I ever bought if you like realistic shooter games this is for you.
4277	1	a	amazing game. probably my most favourite. worth every penny.
158	1	a	 Very Addictive   I would highly recommend this game to anyone looking for an in-depth military sandbox shooter. This game does a great job overall of satisfying the thirst for using tactics in combat. Before I get any farther into this review, I would like to point out that this game is nothing like COD or Battlefield. That doesn't necessarily mean it can't be fast paced, but the learning curve for this game can be kind of deep for some. I'm going to focus primarily on general gameplay, rather than go in-depth with mods.   Overall Gameplay 9/10  This game is often called a walking simulator, however this game is so much more than that. Once you play long enough, you just look at walking as another method of travel. You start weighing your options as you come into contact with objectives/other players. Do you want to risk driving to a location, only to get blown up by AT (anti-tank) or would you rather take the longer, but mostly safer method of walking. Once you get yourself in this mindset you really stop caring about how much you have to walk. That being said you can see how decisions can ultimately lead to success or failure. This is perhaps one of favorite things about this game. Want to stealthily insert from the sea SEAL style? Would you rather set up on a hill 1.5km away and pick off the enemy? Or would you rather roll with a battalion of tanks and annihilate everything in your path. The decision is ultimately yours. You may find that a lot of this isn't in the vanilla game, but thankfully the modding community has done an amazing job shaping this game into so much more.   Combat 8/10 : Combat is great, but it has its problems (some very frustrating problems at that). PvP combat is always amazing and most of the time it comes down to who has the better tactics. However... The AI is ridiculous. It has gotten better overtime, but the AI is completely unpredictable. Sometimes you can drive up to them and kill all of them without them even getting a shot off, or you can be 1km off sitting on a hill with your sniper and start picking them off, only to be obliterated by them with ridiculous aim. Don't let that ruin your experience though. Some of my favorite moments in this game have to do with the AI doing something completely hilarious (EX: taking you on a tour of a town in a small hatchback for no apparent reason).   Mechanics 9/10:    falls 2 feet to the ground, dies...  To be fair combat mechanics in Arma 3 are much better IMO than that of previous Arma titles. Bullet penetration is verrryyyy well done. It can easily give you an advantage especially if you have a weapon like the .50 cal Lynx that can kill enemies in armored vehicles. Bullet spread/drop seems realistic enough. If your one of those people like me who wanted sniper mechanics to be real you'll be mostly dissappointed, but ranging and bullet drop can be compensate a little. There are lots of options for movement and stances (they can actually benefit you greatly in combat). I HIGHLY recommend staying away from rocks. I have no idea why, but rocks can instakill/trap you if your not careful. Not all rocks are like this, mostly just large ones... stay away...    Visuals 9/10:  When first playing this game on ultra it can be breath taking. For the full experience I would highly suggest wearing some nice headphones and turn up the volume. The immersion is very enjoyable. If you can't run the game on ultra dont feel left out. It still looks great, and can often times give you an unfair advantage over players online (being able to see through foilage/fog).   There's probably a lot I could add to this review, but a lot of the enjoyment comes from mods. There are too many good ones to list.  I may sound a little biased because I love this game so much, but if the above that I described sounds remotely like something your interested in then I highly recommend it.
1312	1	a	Best game i have ever played. The Arma series is realy improving from Arma2 to Arma3. The graphics are superb, frame rate is good, overall it still needs some work on campaign and map design. I recently read a post from the mayor of Altis and he said that it 'Turend their peaceful little island into a battleground and that it showed a local buisness factory that is private and secret.' Overall i rate this game a 4 out of 5.
3168	1	a	With the amount of Community support, this game is a must buy.
4807	1	a	Fantastic Game ... Best Mil Sim game i ever palyed !! :D
5298	1	a	I can't picture my life without this game. *cries* This game does not get any better for a military simulation. So many hours never bored.  10/10
4107	1	a	Fun with friends. 
2775	1	a	great game
2670	1	a	great when playing with friends or on a server with other people but can get boring when you are just playing by yourself.
677	1	a	I think that this is absolutly the best game in the world. It offers you the best war simulation (bullets balistic, limited ammo, the inventory system...) with hundreds of weapon and vehicles. It has many game mode which can also been created by the players and even the campaign (followed by secondary missions, the 'demonstrations') is very nice and has a interesting story. Because all of these things I've reached more than 1500 hours, i definitly recommend this game to everyone!
2874	1	a	This game is totally KEK!
717	1	a	That Game is a lot of fun with a lot of game modes. My favorite is BattleRoyale. 
2985	1	a	if you like awesome army stuff then multiply by 100 = Arma3
4106	1	a	This game is actually pretty impresive. Real physics,life from a fighter, lets call it. Have you spended 60 $ on GTA V Because its fun? Try this one,it will be more greater and more funnier. Want to know why? Gta v is Rubbish. If youll buy Arma 3 you will never regret that you bought this game. And for Bohemia Interactive,Keep up the Good job that you done there. :)
2097	1	a	Perfect for me and my bushes
3555	1	a	After nearly 1000 hours in ArmA3, I feel like I have gathered enough experience to review this game.   It's good.  
1369	1	a	Nothing like pretending to screw up countries!
1529	1	a	In Arma 1-2, you can crawl, walk, run and now in Arma 3 you can swim... Yet you still can't â¥â¥â¥â¥ing jump. 8/10. Would be 10/10 if you could jump.
2952	1	a	This is truly the best game i've ever played. Buy it. You'll have a blast. I recommend that you take a little time to learn/tweak the key mapping (or if the default keys are to your liking, keep them) and do a few tutorials on weapons. There is a lot of control in this game and it can be used to your advantage. After over 300 hrs i can only think of two things that i wish were different;   MODDERS HELP US!  1- We need knives as a weapon choice. sneaking up behind a sniper while he's not watching his back... A knife would be nice....  2- I would prefer more rudder authority on the heli's or at least a sensitivity option for it. The current seems a little bit lacking in that department.(like it was set up for first time pilots to learn to fly)  All in all, I highly recommend this game and give it a BIG two thumbs up
3403	1	a	i forgot i needed a parachute
4730	1	a	What I love about this game is that it's not about the firefight, it's about the pressure leading up to the firefight.
3479	1	a	A solid update to a solid franchise.
2722	1	a	Truly immersive experience full of amazing content that will have you playing for hours, definitely worth a buy.
72	1	a	The only game where another person on the other end of the mic makes you do push ups irl.
2209	1	a	Played it multiple times and every time it is different.  This is one of the best games i ever played and will play again.
2535	1	a	A really good game that can get boring at times but over all id give it a 10/10 !!!!!!
3606	1	a	Pretty good
106	1	a	ARMA 3 Multiplayer review 10/10 So my first day on ARMA&lt;3 3. I was born. I rolled out the spawn point. Before I even got out spawn the was a hive of activity from people running around shouting profanities in ever language you can think of. From the kid running down the road after his car that been robbed by three guys who are now flipping the kid the middle finger as the kids is chasing them down the road shouting in his high pitched voice â GIVE ME MY CAR BACK YOU F&amp;%$%â. Then the is that guy all geared up looking like he just came from a game off battlefield 4 who is selling his expert military killing skills to you for a one time low price â protection to hits all under ones roof, you a fresh you should hire me I would give ya some tipsâ he shouts in a menacing voice at you. Donât forget the fresh spawns running around trolling people, lying in front of their cars stopping them from driving off, to the five guys surrounding the only cop in the place shouting at the top of their voiceâs â we are protesting against the police force you are corruptâ I could hardly take it all in when a Dutch guy walks up to me and says âhi dude how are you?â  I replied âim cool just looking to get $hit rolling, you know?â the Dutch guy say to me in a very mellow voice, very very mellow voice â yar come with me brudda I got two friends we going to make some money you wan in?â Without a thought I now found myself in a car with three guys who are all not talking even when I ask them where we going. we head down the road at speed, before long we are in a field with the guys now out the car pointing guns at me all shouting at the top of the voices âget out the F$Â£%% car now!â intermediated and curious at the same time I get out the car. To find one of them smashing me over the head with his pistol in a rocky balboa of a swing witch sends me crashing to the floor. Now the three bandits have me on the floor and are now proceeding to hit me over and over again to keep me there, they ask me for one million dollars. I laugh at them and tell them im fresh to this hold thing I have no money. They chat around to around for a minute then they tell me that I have wasted there time and im going to have to payâ¦  They then opened fire on me and I was killed.  Spawn back in where the guy with the menacing voice runs up to me and says âdonât get in cars with strangers, that one is on the houseâ as he walks off in to the long dusty road of Role Play. I ended up making a â¥â¥â¥â¥ load of friends on the sever, it was great Altis life. Joined a clan steam rolled through the clan and became warlords in our own rights. Zeus the clan ran the sever we had our fat fingers in all the pies. Not a lot â¥â¥â¥â¥ed with us but if they did we would pull such a force together with ours members and our allies, no one could escape. Robbing banks, robbing players homes, robbing players, taking hostages for ransom if no pay out shot the â¥â¥â¥â¥er and make a carpet out of him, drug dealing, drug farming, drug taking knocking off drug dealers and farmers the lot. It was like my very own Scarface.  Military Simulator Game ARAM&lt;3 Is an awesome game, brilliant combat simulation with breathtaking graphics and terrain. The standard maps are based on two real islands in the Mediterranean sea in Greece. The maps are identical to the real islands. The game developers went to that much length to map the terrain that they got arrested by the Greek authorities for spying, thatâs commitment. The Incredible scale of Altis the main island is over 270 kilometers, it has 730klm of road linking 50 towns, villages, and cities. Accurate star map for navigation.  The islands have five unique factions, NATO, CSAT, AAF, FIA and the civilians each have their own motives and vehicles. Over 15 stances, now remember your keys you donât want to get stuck in one of them. The moding is great on this the are tones of mods out there for you where its game type to gun grips and that AK47 you always wanted. The multiplayer and the moding community work well together. But I find the game modes and vanilla content good as well. Breaking point and arma life, wasteland chernus (cherno map for arma2 dayz mod) are but a couple of mods you should check out. The list goes on. The is so much i could say more about this game but that list goes on too. I give this the best marks i can.
2752	1	a	If you are looking for a really realistic game this is perfect for you. It is probably one of the best games ever made, can be a bit hard to learn due to many controls
3019	1	a	Since I started playing this, I haven't played anything else. Best game I've ever played. Great Mods like Altis Life, keep me playing for hours.
