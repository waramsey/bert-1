2681	1	a	Very fun lots to do and is a great experience
931	1	a	The best game ever.
4924	1	a	This game is hands down one of the best experiences you can get on a PC. The gameplay is amazing and the amount of great mods is breathtaking.
726	1	a	If you enjoy arcadey games like Call of Duty or Battlefield then this game might not be for you. However, if you enjoy a realistic aspect to an FPS game and want to meet other like minded people then this game is right for you. 10/10 would recommend.
4288	1	a	worst game
2956	1	a	It's vital to understand that this game is a platform. The things you can do in Arma 3 vary substantially as you explore the well made campaign, community made missions, and popular pvp game modes. Without downloading any of the amazing free mods, Arma 3 has the potential to provide some of the greatest experiences of natural vicious combat possible in gaming. When played with a microphone with or without known friends, teamwork effortlessly comes as you end up doing whatever you can to NOT DIE.   Because the game has so many options to play, you may find yourself playing boring game modes, or thrown together single player community made missions. This is why I'd like to recommend a couple ways for you to enjoy this astonishing. Creating or joining a group delving into medium to large scale COOP encounters is absolutely staggering. While some groups require entire application processes, more casual ones exist that are still incredibly fun such as Reddit's /r/ProjectAwesome. If you just wanna jump in for a a couple hours instead of scheduling events a week in advance, check out the ever present King of the Hill servers (preferably infantry only). Whatever you do, USE A MIC and DON'T BE SHY! You get from this game what you put into it so interacting with others will enhance your enjoyment tremendously.  Once you find the way you like to play here, I can promise, despite its flaws, that every facet of design will coalesce into a truly unique experience that will give you mind numbing moments you will never forget.
5365	0	a	(free weekend)   GTX 760, intelcore I5, windows 8.1 (64 bit), 8 gigs of ram, directX 11, and the game still runs like crap on the lowest setting. do not recommend.
4116	1	a	I still can't land a plane....
2720	1	a	Arma 3 is my favourite game. It offers such a platform, that allows tons of mods such as DayZ, Overwatch, Epoch, Exile, etc. While still being great on its own!  Make sure to have a few friends to play this with, as then the experience is better.   
3769	1	a	I wanted to play a game were i could snipe but realisticly, most people told me to play battlefield 4 or battlefield 1 but tbh it wasnt good enough so i went and asked a couple friends and they said arma 3 and ive only been playing it for 23.6 hours but i feel like ive played so much already like in KOTH( King of the Hill) i already have enough money to buy a sniper plus a scope, im looking forward to shooting some people in the face.     BloodThirst, out
4414	1	a	Simply Amazing.  After playing arma 1, arma 2, arma 3 is by far the best.  Guess what?, iv never tried the mulitplayer, also guess what?, iv never even attempted to try the single player...  All 350 hours iv spent on this has been on the Editor, making missions, huge battles, base attacks, its just great.  But i have to say, this game wouldn't be what it is, without the Modding community too, Mods are essential.  The only downfall i found with arma 3 is that its set in 2035 i think?, the future weapons are very tacky, nothing beats a good old AK47 show down   So because of the whole future thing, i rate it 9/10
4250	1	a	Bohemiaâs gone to immense effort to create real, immersive environments for Arma 3. Across two sprawling islands youâll find all kinds of terrain, from salt-flats to forests to stretches of rocky coastline. Even without a directed experience, just spawning into those maps is a pleasurable experience, letting you explore and discover some amazing virtual places. Arma 3 is also that rare â these days â game that will push all but the most powerful PC hardware. It looks amazing even on older systems, but if you want to crank it up at eye-bleeding resolutions youâre going to see performance loss.  
1782	1	a	One&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;best&nbsp;games&nbsp;I&nbsp;ever&nbsp;played. A&nbsp;hardcore&nbsp;milsim. The&nbsp;opposite&nbsp;of&nbsp;CoD. I&nbsp;am&nbsp;now&nbsp;addicted&nbsp;to&nbsp;flight&nbsp;C:
2501	1	a	Epoch. Should I say more?
5417	0	a	In my opinion the second game is much more fun. I don't really like the setting, and the game is just not Arma. This game is more like 'Arma: Tactical Roleplay Altis Life'.
5050	1	a	
2165	1	a	Hit a rock in a hunter, fly 5Km away.  10/10 Best Game Out There
3616	1	a	Really good Game
4102	1	a	How to play arma EPOCH. Step 1) Spawn in run around get spawn killed by campers. Step 2) Spawn in run around again, But make it out and get a gun, then get killed by falling down some stairs. Step 3) Get a team worthy team mate, Get back stabbed by this 'Team worthy Team mate' die. step 4) Rinse and repeat for 400+ hours. Step 5) Get a gun + base, Get kiled by hackers shooting through walls, step 5) Get trapped in a house and get told to sing or die,  step 6) Die      Step 1002030) Get trapped everywhere, Kill everyone, Destroy bases.    Step 1234567087) shoot a rabit from 10000m and eat it for survival, Kill all admins become king of EPOCH,   Step 999999999999) Lose your mind start talking tou your self and always be paranoid about someone watching or following you in a car.
328	1	a	This game is a rly fun and who ever wants to buy it go for it
2495	1	a	Great game with GREAT Modes, Everyone should buy it.   Huge maps with up to 100+ players online.  I recommend geting Battle royale mod which is a 1 vs all mode, last one standing wins the game.
3779	1	a	Would this work on a mac
292	1	a	*HIGHLY RECOMMENDED*  This is one of the best Strategy Action Simulators i have played since ArmA II. Looks beautiful if you have top range PC. One Downside is that it is highly intensive on your CPU and I cannot recommend this for low end computers/laptops. You never run out of things to do, due to the Steam Workshop and Level Editor where many people create great game types and areas for combat.  I give a 9/10
3945	1	a	it's alright
1741	1	a	Arma 3 hay s the gun play of call of duty and the wide vehicle selection like battlefield.
5057	0	a	Runs like â¥â¥â¥â¥ on everything.
575	0	a	This game is huge. It has endless possibilities. It COULD provide lots of fun but what happens in the end, is the absolutely poorly optimized engine which completely fails to deliver smooth experience. I own a 980GTX + i7 and 16gig of ram and no matter what settings I set up, I always get 20-30 fps, and in intense firefights it slows to a miserable 10-15. The game was launched back in 2013 and it really hurts to see Bohemia fail to deliver a smooth experience for everyone. Its a joke, really. Almost two years and we still have these problems. Shame.
3903	1	a	Kayzar thinks I play this game too much.
3972	1	a	set everything to low and still got 20 fps  10/10 Optimization
1744	1	a	2D 8bit platformer, good game. 10/10
3046	1	a	Best game of 2014 Award goes to this withought question!
2202	1	a	The actual game itself isn't over the top bad. Sure, the animations aren't exactly top notch, and there are some bugs and hiccups. But a huge open world, massive multiplayer servers with hundreds of players, tanks, planes, and explosions certainly make up for its downsides. Its something I could sit down and play for hours...    Just make sure to stay the hell away from Altis Life Roleplay. 13 year old police and constant mugging of my $2 apples killed 4,239,321 of my brain cells in 20 minutes. Please, retain your IQ points, don't play altis life roleplay.
4705	1	a	I wish I could Pull the sh*t Frankie does. Oh well, I still enjoy getting executed.
4699	1	a	Arma 3 is a really great game. I loved Arma 2, and I love this game too. It's really awsome and fun to play, the graphics just look amazing, the gameplay mechanics are better then in Arma 2 ( a lot better ). I don't like the DLC thing that they are doing, I mean Arma 3 got so much less weapons and vehicles then Arma 2 + expansions, and the idea of charging us 10-20â¬ for simple dlc like marksmen or helicopters that should be part of the main game ( beacuse there ain't much weapons in the game, atleast compared to Arma 2 ), I understand that you want to make money but atleast make the DLC 3-10â¬ MAX! It's just not worth spending 13â¬ on a simple dlc that adds few guns and a full ghillie, or few new helicopters, or if you are going to make expensive DLC's make them atleast bring much new content with them.  ~Ratings~ - Gameplay: 9/10 - Graphics: 10/10 - Story: 7/10 - Multiplayer ( best part ): 9.5/10 - Price: 6/10 ( beacuse of the expensive dlc but if i had to rate the price of the game without the annoying dlc: 8/10 )  ~~My overall rating is~~ 8.5/10... why?  - The game is worth buying, but as I said above, it has expensive DLC with not much content in it and it makes it hard to play the game without it ( mostly if you play mp you won't be able to acces the new weapons / vehicles and you are kinda in a disadvantage ).  - Sorry for my english, it's not perfect but I'm doing my best :) -
3333	1	a	kinda boring but ya know whatever  5/10 wouldnt play again l0l ecks dee
4293	1	a	Kids play Cod Boy play battlefield Men Play ARMA
2840	1	a	I want to start off saying that I absolutely love this game.. However, I've managed to log a fair amount of hours and I've noticed that with every update that bohemia puts out, this game loses playability. Fps drops, glitches, screwed up animations, and exploits. When I first started playing Arma 3, it was beautiful. I had no problems running this game at all. With the last three updates it has gotten worse each time. Bohemia needs to finish the game and test their content before the release it to ruin the gameplay experience for their hefty price tag on this title. When this game is functioning properly, it's by far one of the best games I've ever played and by far the most realistic. It has very diverse gameplay, with many mods available via  armaholic.com  and the DLC that they've released with the game.   So in summary, if I'm paying 59.99 for Arma 3 and also buying their DLC, along with all of the other paying customers. The developers of said title should have enough funds and the ability to ensure that their game works properly.
2104	1	a	great game! i remember when i was a child i will grab sticks that look like guns and grab my friends and act like we are in war and do funny call outs xD but this game really brout my childhood back to life you need to get this game! grab a couple of friends and do some wasteland or king of the hill! or just get one of those sick survival mods and try to survive with friends! its a amazing game 10/10 also there is role playing servers and there is that arma 3 life mod witch is AMAZING! please if you have the money get this game! if you like titical shooters this is the one for you!
1235	0	a	Sheitty DLC that is about the same price of the full game? Hell yeah!  Optimization? Naaahhh who needs that.
5415	1	a	Any one selling arma 3 cheap as a gift? add me i have paypal and ROK willing to trade
2816	1	a	Very realistic video game

1058	1	a	10/10
1546	1	a	Used way too much time on this game. It's so good.
5336	1	a	I'm not skilled at this game, yet, though I do find that this is definitely something that I would recommend. Here is what I find great about Arma 3:   Absolutely amazing graphics and visual effects   The most realistic military simulator out there, no doubt about it   The voice commands in the game are smooth and consistent   You want tanks? Boom, have a tank. You want helicopters? Then have a helicopter! It's all in one great game!  There are many more things about Arma 3 that make it awesome, one list simply can't do Arma 3 justice. I have no regrets for purchasing this game at full price. If I were to have but one complaint, it's that it's hard to  git gud .
1896	1	a	I broke the rules but im not a rapper
2602	1	a	If you played Arma 2 and loved it there is a solid chance you will love arma 3. They are two games that have so much in common but Arma 3 offers new and unique features all at the same time.
4079	1	a	Greatest GAME EVA!!! 
5281	1	a	Great game.
842	1	a	This game is the best fps you could play. But this new update with the new stamina adjustments messed up a lot of things. Still a great game, just needs to be fixed.
3521	1	a	The best war simulator there is. Plus its on sale now... GO BUY IT!!!
2155	1	a	A piece of unoptimized â¥â¥â¥â¥. The game that has a bunch of dlc despite it being unfinished but it is still a very fun game to play.
3958	1	a	This is one of the most interesting and expansive games out there. The current storyline and background is a bit unrealistic-The Republic of Altis and Stratis has a super-advanced military but the nation has under 50,000 people in its population. The population also is Greek, but for whatever reason all speaks english-even the armed forces. Nonetheless, the mission editing is superb compared to Arma 2, the mechanics are mostly improved (animation and AI needing a bit of a change for realism) the voice acting for British and American English as well as Farsi is superb. Iran has a huge presence in the game, however it is never mentioned and instead goes under the quite unrealistic banner of Canton-Protocol Strategic Alliance Treaty, or CSAT. I really wish that BIS would at least include the Iran flag above the CSAT insignia on the uniforms, for it looked absolutely amazing when this was the case at E3 2011. Physics in the game are great, however the fabled ragdoll physics are a bit dissapointing. All they seem to do is make units die in a more unrealistic-looking way. NATO is portrayed as completely bankrupt which really bothers me-unemployment is at freaking 50% in the US. It is interesting to see future interpretations of the US Army, which use the new multicam pattern in their uniforms. I am bothered by the lack of ANY, yes ANY authentic equipment in the game. This is perhaps my biggest problem, for it gives the developers an excuse to make fantasy content for every upcoming Arma game. Yes, it saves on lisencing, but the developers just launched a 650-thousand dollar modding contest. A fraction of the money could have been spent on making the weapons and vehicles authentic.   With a host of friends to play with, some mods, and an open mind, this title is one of the most awesome games I have ever played. The simulation of the vehicles is amazing, with support for almost every joystick, controller, or other external device you can think of. The game fails to provide an immersive atmosphere but is a fun and engaging way to play COOP with friends, strategy being completely necessary. The graphics are in my top 10 games ever, and the performance is better than with Arma 2, especially if you plan on making Youtube videos like I do. (check out my Youtube channel: FistoGames :D ) Go and buy it. With some DLC's that bring it back to where Arma 2 was in scenario, it will definitely be an amazing game.        
4286	1	a	Relly happy with Arma 3. A very good game after Bohemias previous game, Arma 2. I like that you can do so much with this game. From WasteLand and King of the hill to Altis Life, but there is also more. You can use the workshop now, wich is a huge improvement from Arma 2.  Only bad thing in my opinion are the DLC,s. I really liked the DLC,s from Aram 2 but i wasn't really so happy when i bought the DLC Bundle for Arma 3.   First DLC: Some Karts no one really cared for, maybe a little bit fun on the Role-Playing servers but didn't matter a bit in the War scenarios.   Second DLC: Added TWO Helicopters. They were ofcourse pretty good, with one Hueron (Chinook) and one Taurus. But the bad thing is that this DLC costs around 13 euros. For TWO Helis!  Third DLC: Now this DLC is the good one though. The Last 'Marksman' DLC added alot of new weapons, such as snipers and LMG,s. I really liked these weapons and they are really good.  So for me this game earnes a 8/10  
411	1	a	This game will make you love it. Then it will kick you in the nuts and you will hate it. Then you will love it again
1315	1	a	Really good game, I got addicted as soon as I started to play Altis life and Stratis Wasteland. I just cant stop playing it now!
4907	1	a	Awesome,simply the ultimate military simulation. Fantastic graphics and visual and pure realism. Incredible weapons feedback and perfect accuracy of balistic and physical.  Many awesome user missions such as: Altis life RPG, Wasteland and many more .   
2502	1	a	What needs to be said, this is Arma, the penultimate of military games. If you are looking for a military game get this one, it's based off of actual US military simulations. It can't get much better than that!
2680	1	a	A great Milsim , mod friendly shooter that has depth and plenty of gameplay variety .
3165	1	a	One of the best and must have game on PC, it doesn't matter if you like Millitary sim or not. Arma 3 with its mods has something especial just for you. I've been playing this game since alpha and still find something new to play and enjoy.
3518	1	a	It's cool if you like playing with people who take this way too seriously.  EDIT 2/14/16  ArmA 3 actually taught me how to tread water.I'm being serious here.It actually taught me how to tread water.I'm a great swimmer now and I can probably be a Marine Raider since they're more bad â¥â¥â¥ than Navy SEALs.
2630	1	a	Best Game In The World
3229	1	a	This Game... OMG Altis life is one of the best parts of the game. You and your friends doing jobs such as: Cocaine, Heroin, Weed, Diamond, Oil and Iron jobs and much more. Then going out to be a Rebel or be a Cop or just a normal Civilian.   Me and my 3 friends are enjoying this game ALOT. And you will aswell. And if you dont want to play Altis, then you can also play the Campaign and that is really fun aswell, im not a big fan of it but you might be. This game is for every guy who likes the realistic military gameplay and realistic gameplay like the real world.   You can also get the DayZ mod and the Battle Royale mod. I havent tried the DayZ Yet but the Battle Royale is REALLY good. Its a great mod and it should get into the game itself instead of being a mod that you can download.   But this game is really all the money worth.
2837	1	a	The community has a powerful effect on the game. Different game mods,maps,addons and alot more. Definitely worth it.
2569	1	a	it is a amazing game butt it has sum hikups 
2020	1	a	I never played ARMA II. I've probably spent all the time in ARMA III in the 77th JSOC server. Amazing server and an amazing community just in the base game. The game has a solid singleplayer campaign that takes place on two greek islands (without cyclopses unfortuanely) where you play as a soldier fighting for your and your field corps' survival.  Highly realistic, great SP campaign, great MP, has an active modding scene, a lot of DLC updates that doesn't split the community. It's hard to not recommend this fantastic title!
1335	1	a	Awesome game to play
4874	1	a	Fantastic game in my opinion. Definetly requires friends to play with. If you're looking for a hardcore shooter, look no further than BECTI hardcore arma 3 servers. Rolling in transport choppers with entire squads of players rappeling down with armor being lifted AND Close air support is the exciting and fun. I give a solid 9.5/10, I only give the 9.5 because of the fact that there are still some bugs that can cause crazy things to happen (Such as a tiny one foot high post blowing up my armored car)
3004	1	a	All wars should be fought on ARMA.
4035	1	a	was fun
5374	1	a	Great war simulator. Way better than all these arcade shooters. In this game, you have to think strategically and be careful, because mechanics is demanding. It has developed multiplayer and many huge mods like Breaking Point, Exile etc. Campaign is more difficult than other games' campaignes, but multiplayer has many different kinds of servers. You will be satisfied. 9/10
1117	1	a	the beast :D
4737	1	a	An amazing game despite the bugs and excessive payment for extra content, I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys realisitic shooters and a childish community.
483	1	a	Handcuffed by 3 men. Took my shirt and my pants off. They took deep breaths into the mic. All three stole a bags worth of blood from me. Hit me once with their fist each. Left me to die. Broke out. Found a crowbar. Killed one. Ran away. Crawled into a house almost dead. Had a friend come save me. I wasnt gonna be able to make it i thought. We went into another city looking for a blood bag. Upon entering the hospital we were greated by one of the men that almost killed me. The blasted my friends brains on me. I ran out as fast as the game would let me. I ran to a town. Shot after shot was fired at me. I kept yelling into the mic 'You suck at shooting!' Nearing at the town i was hit once. I crawled up to the top floor and used my only rag to stop bleeding. By this point i knew I was gone. Tears were streaming down my face as I wished it didnt have to happen like this. I could hear him running along the floor below me looking for me. He came out of the doorway from the stairs and i scream 'WAIT!'... He pointed his gone at me. I closed my eyes and braced myself. nothing happened..... I looked him in the eyes as he looked at mine. I told him the bad things i did. I told him about my family. My friend that he killed. I told him how what they did to me i had deserved it. I could see tears streaming down his face. He looked at me and told me something. He told me how he knew i killed one of his friends. He told me how the other was shot in a shoot out. His face soaked with tears he pointed the gun at me. I said 'no need. we have both lost something.' He put the gun down. 'We can end this together. No need for anymore violence. We dropped our stuff and walked to the edge. I looked to my right and he looked to his left. we both said 'Thank you..' at the exact same time. We both jumped off the edge and died right next to each other. i felt my soul leave my body.  Then i respawned
5128	0	a	Could be good but riddled with bugs and people that are elitist â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. I spent hours watching videos and reading web pages and as soon as I came across a problem that I could not find a solution for online, all you get in any chat channel is a bunch of jerks that accuse you of not looking â¥â¥â¥â¥ up. WHAT A MASSIVE WASTE OF MY MONEY!! The technology is there, the game is ok looking but all the time textures pop in and out and there is a lot of glitches and problems. I run this on a great machine that has never had a problem running anything but this game even after 3 years has a ton of visual issues. PASS!
4077	1	a	I like this game because it feels realstic and feels like your actually in the game.
4468	1	a	Excellent game, I would highly recommend.
3049	1	a	I was never a big fan of simulators let alone military simulators, but the first time I played arma 2 I fell in love. Although, I never bought arma 2 I did buy arma 3 and holy crap was it amazing. Amazing graphics, an amazing aresnal, and an amazing game. There is many glitches and long waits to do a mission, but you can see through that and notice the beauty arma 3 gives. There is many fun game modes and even mods to spruce up the adventure. So, pick up a gun a helmet AND GET OUT THERE SOLIDER.
1116	1	a	that feel when you spend $60 on arma 3 then it comes on sale and costs $20 next day
4264	1	a	Arma 2 customizability with a better engine, this game will be worth it's money through community made games alone
3834	1	a	Indeed one of the best military simulators yet. So much to do you would never get bored.  63/64 cancer pasients would survive cancer after playing Arma 3.
2723	1	a	An in depth and expansive third/first person shooter with the amazing capabilty of catering to multiple different interests and game genres at once, Arma 3 is a pretty good time as long as you have the buddiesa to explore it with. Most complain asbout game performance, and that is because this title relies heavier on your CPU than your GPU, meaning that people with the beastliest of graphics cards can still have issues. This is the only major bad thing about Arma, everything else is fun and accessible, even if there is a major learning curve at the start. If you want to explore vast open worlds, mod the hell out of something, play insane hundred player multiplayer battles, or Role Play as a lone soldier behind enemy lines, Arma 3 is probably for you.
1979	1	a	Nice game but soometimes a little bit laggy.
3285	1	a	9.5/10  A brilliant game for anyone who wants a realistic* and immersive warfare game. I've been with this game since the alpha and enjoyed every moment.  pros -Long and detailed campaign with a good story -varying multiplayer for all players -large mod base for improving or extending the game -large amount of customization for the player loadout and weapons -immersive and realistic* gameplay -stunning graphics (see cons for exceptions) -extremely large terrains for gameplay  cons -some of the audio is slightly unrealistic such as explosions (can be fixed with mods such as speed of sound pure) -particle effects are a let down for the graphics -there is not a massive amount of weapons available in the vanilla game* (there are many mods which add more weapons to the game)  *personal opinions (some people may disagree with these)
3704	1	a	An amazing game! Millitary sandbox with many game modes. Milsim, Roleplaying, TDM and Capture the Hill. This game is for everyone!
2616	1	a	I have played arma 3 for a while now and feel like I should give it a review.  Arma 3 is basically THE war SIMULATOR! If you are looking for some awesome realistic wars, you have found your game. There are A LOT of gamemodes online, each on is different. The amount of mods and user created content for the game is insane. You can create your OWN missions and play the with your friends or share them on the workshop.  There is only one HUGE drawback to this game. Due to it looking so good, you will need a GOOD pc. That's the only the biggest issue I came across.   The interface is one of the things I think could be different but I dont know how. Mabey with the use of a some sort 'action key' could make it a bit less gimmecky.  Afterall I would totally recommend this game but DONT expect it to be anywhere like cod or bf. Its totally diffrent.  Worth the price I paid with the summer sales! :D

5244	0	a	the multiplayer is awesome but laggy as hell. the Singleplayer is the worse ever...the NPC as dumb as â¥â¥â¥â¥ not helping at all and CSAT just got billions of soldiers. For me as a beginner it is just rubbish...they give you tasks and you have absolutlty NOW â¥â¥â¥â¥in idea what you have to do.

766	1	a	Great Game
1232	1	a	This is a really great game! This is not a game for people who are going for a Call Of Duty style gameplay. There are some bugs but the developers are usually good at finding and fixing them. Cool DlC's are released frequently. The physics are quite nice, no un-realistic ragdoll effects when you die, nice vehicle handling, just dont fall down the stairs or else you wil die haha, they do need to fix that. The campaign is a thrilling story of a young Corporal Kerry who you'll play as. The maps are EXTREMELY detailed everywhere, there are so many cool and breath-taking areas of the two islands of Stratis and Altis. There are tons of servers and gamemodes so you can't be bored. There is also the option to mod this game in so many cool and fantastic ways it seems endless! But be warned, the controls are not so easy, they are not your simple stand, crouch, prone. The vehicle's controlling is decent but you will likely need some practice for the jets and helicopters which I had to do. The AI's path-taking and combat skills are impressive, at times they can act stupid. This game is a must-have for the computer gamer! I give this game a solid 5 out of 5 stars for its gameplay. I would recommend this game to anyone interested in a next level military simulation game. The developer's team is bunch of people who really do know what they are doing to make this game outstanding to play. This is not a game where you might think of a bunch of kids acting like they are United States Navy Seals or British SAS, you should think this game as a serious, fun, educational game of how military might work and fight in a simulated warzone. I hope this review encourages you to buy the game AND the DLC for it! I know I will be a constant customer with the amount of great work the developers have done to Arma 3.
5249	0	a	Over-priced, Over-hyped, Lacking in content - NOT WORTH IT. The developers re-use broken code from their earlier hits like Arma 2, Arma 1, Operation Flashpoint etc from 2001. The netcode is a DISASTER! Servers can barely handle more than 50 people and even then it's super laggy, rubber-banding and warping all over the place. The developers are now beginning to start releasing over-priced DLCs - 1. because they were too lazy to release the same content WHICH THEY SHOULD HAVE ANYWAY in the game initial release 2. without fixing the basic game, typical money-grabbing tactic.
3470	1	a	Just Buy It
162	1	a	Here's a story just to tell you what kind of game this is. Lemme start by telling you this game is definitely more of a template than it is a full game solely based on its modding capability alone.   So I have a Vietnam Mod for this game, adds new maps, units, weapons, etc. Our platoon lands in the jungles at LZ Fiona, a clearing in the jungle in the hills. We spread out and head into the jungles. A shot rings out and the LT. takes one in the chest. V.C. Ambush. I hit the ground and ready my M16A1 I have no clue where the rounds are coming from but they're coming. As I'm lying in the brush three figures run by, but they don't look friendly. Startled I swerve quickly back into their direction and let loose a full auto barrage from my 20 round magazine, I see blood flying out of the figures and then they drop. I got three of them. I look back ahead of me and start letting out one-round bursts trying to suppress the enemies on the opposite hillside. Ammo's getting low and the bullets keep coming. I climb through the muck and grunge of the jungle floor to a nearby friendly, he's hit but no time to mourn now. I pilfer through his gear and find what I needed, sweet sweet ammo, ~30 bullets left. I reload, and the hell begins anew.
4262	1	a	my lav got explode by a tente 10/10
3076	1	a	10/10 would play on my toaster again.
3249	1	a	Despite many of its early faults, Bohemia Interactive - as well as the always extremely-active ArmA community of modders et al - really pulled the ArmA universe to a whole new level. The graphics are only the beginning of the immersive environment: realistic projectile ballistics (as well as surprisingly detailed terminal ballistic effects), well-done animations (especially of essential combat tasks, like reloading), and the variable stance/lean system. Unfortunately, there are a few problems that have plagued ArmA since the beginning of time, namely the AI. I say this because even after becoming intimately familiar with the game and the teammate command system, detailed commands are bulky at best. AI as a whole tends to be relatively oblivious when it comes to medium- and 'crew-served' weapons; the suppressive fire command does absolutely nothing with your machinegunners and autoriflemen, and anti-tank gunners apparently forget they have 15 pound rocket launchers strapped to their backs and decide their small arms are the most effective weapons against MBTs. The aerial platforms' damage models could be improved as well (i.e.: losing parts of the aircraft when you clip a tree or wires rather than just exploding), however, this would require a lot more work than may be worth it at this point - perhaps later in A3's lifetime. Fortunately to me, despite these (at times) fatally annoying flaws (*cough* AI *cough*) nothing in the virtual world comes close to the level of accuracy (both from the vanilla BI platform and the ArmA communities' multiple mods) that ArmA 3 delivers.
1617	1	a	One of the best Shooters i played. Seems like never ending fun and ofcourse the endless mod stream! 10/10
611	1	a	1/10 best game of the year - IGN
5313	1	a	very gewd much yes
2236	1	a	I reccomend only if you have a computer that can handle it. Also the controlls arnt easy.
1660	1	a	Very good game, plenty of addons available online to make the singleplayer experience much more enjoyable. A few improvents needed, such as a realistic physics model (you can sprint up hills that would be difficult to walk up in real life) and realistic damage modules (you die instantly from one or two low calibre rounds to the chest when wearing heavy body armour, yet a high calibre sniper round takes three shots to kill an NPC with little body armour). Also needed is improvement to the AI (the AI can engage you with pinpoint accuracy when shooting from 800 metres away with assault rifles - they obviously don't have to worry about the shaky aim that the player has, also they can detect you from over 1km away when it's dark when you, the player, can't even see them with NV or can barely see them with FLIR)   I love this game, and a few minor improvements will make me love it even more!
2560	1	a	Absolultly love this game 10/10. The moding aspect is awsome, if you want to add some real units and some different maps it makes the game just that much more realistic. would highly recommend.
2099	1	a	love this game.. so realistic
3156	1	a	Best game for team work and endless fun. Great graphics too, but you need a beasty system though to enjoy max settings. CPU hungry
1085	1	a	Arma 3 is one of THE BEST games that was released. Although it has some issues at times. its still a VERY GOOD game.   My only flaw would be that is is NOT optimized well enough, which is a shame, they could of made it so much better,   Anyway if you enjoy shooting people, Roleplay, Teamwork or having fun in general then this is the game for you!
2923	1	a	It is pretty good.
1866	1	a	I have to buy a DLC to fly a helicopter. 10/10
548	1	a	NICE SANDBOX GAME,I HOPE THE NEW DLC 'TANOA' WILL BE FREE FOR EVERY ARMA3 USER.
4548	1	a	Game of The Year! Even after the release was Published in 2013! 10/10~
4394	1	a	I absolutely love Arma 3 and would in every way recommend it to anyone with even a passing interest. There are somewhat valid criticisms of it which I will get out of the way right away, before getting into why the pros by far outweigh the cons. 1. Lack of Content - One of the more popular criticisms of this game is the lack of official content in the current build, especially compared to the amount of content in Arma 2. The two main factions currently (at the time of writing this review) have no fixed wing aircraft, armoured vehicles of different factions have the same turrets and weapons merely reskinned (artillery, anti-air and remote controlled turrets on smaller vehicles) and UAVs/UGVs are identical for all factions except for different camo patterns. 2. Performance - Another often heard criticism of Arma 3 is that it performs very poorly on some machines that it often should perform well on. Like machines with top-end graphics cards and powerful CPUs.  Addressing these points one by one, I will say that while there is content missing that even I would have expected the game to have at release, it isn't a whole lot. Arma 2 did not have all the content it does today at it's release either, and much of it is inflated by there being separate entries for guns with different attachment combinations, so that the same gun with four different sight attachments would show up in a list as four different guns. As for the performance issues, the game runs perfectly fine on my middle-of-the-road gaming rig and runs at playable rates on the old low to mid-end machine of my best friend. The performance of the game on some people's high-end machines is in no way a sure indicator of bad optimization, especially when the same game runs great on other machines with the same hardware.  Now getting to the real meat of the review. The visuals of this game are amazing, especially if you have the power to crank up the graphics settings. The lighting is great and makes the game look heavenly, especially at night. The texture quality is top notch, especially for foliage and I fully believe anyone interested in first person shooters, should experience one where you can freely roam a huge 270 square kilometer beautifully rendered island with a rendering distance of several kilometers. Other cool graphical features are the volumetric fog and clouds as well as rain that is rendered as independent particle effects for each raindrop in stead of a mere filter or overlay.  Audio-wise the game could do with some improvements that are guaranteed to happen over time, if not by Bohemia Interactive, then by community modders, however overall the sound design of this game is really quite good as it is.  The gameplay is where Arma 3 really shines over it's predecessor, as controls of your soldier have been improved to feel a lot more direct and fluid than in previous games, though the action menu still tends to limits how good the game can feel in certain situations. The inventory system has seen huge improvements from Arma 2 and is much more streamlined, without sacrificing flexibility. Vehicles are now physics simulated objects, which is a huge improvement over Arma 2's incredibly janky vehicle physics. Underwater gameplay is a really nice addition that looks amazing and gives mission makers a lot more freedom and variety to work with, when making missions and giving the players different approaches to completing them. Firing weapons in Arma 3 feel pretty damn good as most rifles have a good deal of kick to them, making them both sound AND feel powerful in stead of feeling like Call of Duty or Battlefield style bullet-hoses. Different weapon calibers penetrating diferent materials differently at different angles and distances gives both the shooters and the people being shot at a lot of things to think about and decide how to react to in every firefight, which is great in a game that is so decidedly slow paced as Arma is, compared to other first person shooters.  If you get this game and want to dive straight into some fun Arma 3 gameplay, I suggest playing though the first episode of the single-player campaign first, to get acquainted with the fairly complex controls and spotting/shooting enemies at ranges that other FPS games would never expect you to. Once you feel somewhat at home in the game, I highly recommend looking for a multiplayer server running the Wasteland mission, which is sort of like a 3-way Team Deathmatch gamemode with survival elements, base-building, resource gathering and impromptu mini-missions against AI that all of the three teams are given and can undertake at the same time, each team trying to beat the others for the promised reward, leading to some very interesting clashes.  So all in all, I can barely recommend this game enough, but to get some real enjoyment out of it, you'll want to run it on a decent mid to high-end rig.
2203	1	a	Amazing graphics, gameplay and modability 9.5/10
1619	1	a	amazing i love the game!
2010	1	a	i played it.
2568	1	a	Ah where to begin with ARMA 3....   I had just landed on a beach in a rubber boat with my four man team. We are assaulting enemy positions to capture intel and eliminate a HVT. Soon after landing, we are ambushed by an enemy assault boat that promply decimates my team. I manage to land a rocket hit on the boat and incapacitate its crew before it can annihilate me. With the boat disabled, I am now on my own. Do I continue the mission by myself, or do I abort and let my team die for nothing? I choose to continue, using a silenced weapon to help conceal my position. I call for friendly reinforcments to begin the assault on the town. A convoy with friendly troops starts coming down the road. Suddenly, rockets from a hilltop position begin to rain down on the convoy, disabling several vehicles. Everyone dismounts and begins engaging the enemy on the hilltop. I use the distraction to flank the enemy position and eliminate the fireteam. We proceed towards the town, eliminating small pockets of resistance along the way. Suddenly we are pinned down by enemy machinegun fire that kills several friendlies. I call in an airstrike that levels the houses containing the position, eliminating the threat along with the HVT. I then see a target of opportunity: an enemy cargo truck. I align my sights slightly above the target to compensate for the distance and fire. The truck erupts into flames. This came at a price, as my postion was compromised and drew heavy enemy fire towards my position. We have no choice but to engage. After several bloody minutes, four enemy fireteams lay dead on the battlefield with only light casualties on our side. I decide this is the moment to assault the position containing the intel. I successfully acquire the intel and call in an evac chopper to extract me to a safe position. We extract under fire and secure the intel, dealing a severe blow to the enemy.  10/10
5046	1	a	Love this game ! So many game modes and things to do when you get in to the game. have had alot of fun with friends on this :) Highly reccomend it :)
4436	1	a	Best War simulator you can get!!   If you looking for immersive play, where you affraid for your life. this is the game!
2941	1	a	this game is really fun on all the game modes but the best one that i have played by far is the epoch mod .
3657	1	a	Cons Needs a beast PC to run on highest settings. Slightly clunky.  Pro's It's the ultimate military sandbox. Backwards compatible with all legacy content, literally 1,000's of weapons, vehicles and other assets. A ton of beautiful and vast maps, new and legacy. Amazing editor, unlimited options in terms of gameplay. Amazing dedicated modding community, some incredible mods out there, backwards compatible with older mods. Great and varied communities, from fun 'Life' and Zombie clans to serious Milsim units. Continuously being tweaked and improved, regular and substantial official updates. Fair DLC policy, not buying DLC does not stop you from playing with those who do. Combined arms, air, land and sea. Jet pilot to scuba diver. Realistic ballistics modelling.  This is the one, if you have a PC that can run it and you're prepared to get used to the controls there is no limit to what is possible gameplay wise.   Mods include vehicles, weapons, maps, SP/MP missions, campaigns, Star Wars, WW2, 'Nam, realistic comms systems, realistic health management, enhanced avatar movement, uniforms, RTS UI etc etc...  If you like military gaming then you should consider buying Arma 3, to really appreciate how great this game can be join an active well run community, it's the best way to learn about the game and to get the most from it.  9/10 - here's a sweet showcase video that scratches the surface of what's possible in Arma 3.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HzMBOmOweiE 
5098	0	a	At first this game was a lot of fun to play. But with the time it rather got worse than good.  - The game does not go above 29 FPS for me (on i7 4770k, GTX 770, SSD) - It easily drops under 20 FPS when there is a bit of vehicle movement around the map - The AI is programmed really bad. Not finding paths. Not moving at all when told to.  The game is just as good without AI as it is with them. Maybe some dummy targets for your enemies. Which again are overly OP compared to your AI... - Since the shutdown of GameSpy it is completely unavailable for Coop missions with friends. Hosting Steam servers was not working since the games release  And last but not least the price is way too high for a game said to be 'still under development'  I regret every Cent of the 45 Euros which I payed for this game.
1799	1	a	It's pretty good.
1543	1	a	This game is pretty bad.
3328	1	a	yersh das is gud
2541	1	a	arma 3 is the best
5032	1	a	I wish DayZ would be this smooth.
3438	1	a	This game is breath-taking, whether you like fast-paced gunfights, long-range sniper duels, monster-trucking it with M1A2 Slammer tanks, playing Ace Combat with incredibly fluid movement, raiding a small outpost of hostile forces with a attack helicopter, playing a role in week long, server-wide wars, doing night raids on an enemy research facility, setting up a UAV to perform reconnissance on enemy camps, packing your scuba gear and checking out the lost treasures of Altis and Stratis, or just hopping in a plane and enjoying the wide, vast, beauty of this game! ArmA 3 really dominates the 'realistic, military, video game/simulator' genre. Combine some wicked creativity with ArmA 3's mission editor mode and you can create your own missions and scenarios. In the past people have used this to make their own additions to the game, such as new weapons, vehicles, clothing, and even entire maps! ArmA 3's customization is endless and will keep you constantly changing guns, attachments for them, and other equipment to match the situation your in. If you feel like playing solo, ArmA 3 has totally revamped its Campaign mode to keep the player's attention and actually immerse you in the ArmA universe, or forget the single-player all together and go play good cop-bad cop on Altis Life, a user created gamemode, or blowing up tanks and getting in random firefights with other players in Wasteland, also a user-created gamemode. If none of this satisfies you, then you can always just build your own mission, so that you and your own private team can go and enjoy a experience that I guarntee you is as close as you'll get to war before enlisting!
4318	1	a	Great game! Once your done with the single player there is an insane amount of mods and modes to play.   Some of the DLC is over priced or otherwise not worth buying.
1550	1	a	Great game. I bought this after playing DayZ standalone and having never played the DayZ mod or Arma 2. The most realistic combat game I ever played. A must have. 9/10
2367	1	a	Great game 8/10 but servers are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ as â¥â¥â¥â¥. Need optimization bad.
1164	1	a	Fantastic progress made by the developers, the most realistic combat style game yet
1838	1	a	its rlly rlly gud u shuld buy it m8.
3300	1	a	You know a game is good when you spend more than 50 hours on it, on Christmas week, totally ignoring friends and family. Opening presents? â¥â¥â¥â¥ that! I'm playing ARMA.
2050	1	a	This soul sucking game has claimed my life for pratically 1000 hours now so here's my 2 cents.  This game is infectious once you start modding it, you'll discover new ways to obliterate your friends, enemys, vehicles, entire towns etc.  Then you'll start looking for groups, you'll probably start with a milsim group, these are great, but can be demanding and will drain your life essence with their rules, SOP's and formalities. Then there's the casual groups who do whatever, whenever. These are pure chaos and make modern army's look totally restrained in the level of pure destruction they bring to anything and everything.  Finally, once you got settled in the group of your choice, you'll start enjoying the game even more, then you'll forget the taste of food, or the sound of water, or touch of grass, you're naked in the dark, with nothing.  And that is ARMA 3 in a nutshell, an awesome all consuming entity with the power to consume your very soul.   ENJOY :)
3608	1	a	fully hectic lad
1625	1	a	Best game ever. (really is if its your style)  would rate game again for community badge
2300	1	a	10/10, most fun I've had in any multiplayer Steam game.
2690	1	a	look at my hours tho +1
169	1	a	Fantastic game. Very slow to learn alone but with friends on a large server.. was fun. Hours of laughs, stress, goose bump urban warfare and guerrilla warfare. Very realistic and the graphics... WOW! Goodbye Call of Duty and Battlefield... Arma 3 is the real deal!
3926	1	a	This game is absolutley wonderful. I have played about 11 hours of this game and i have not gotten bored yet. There is so much you can do in this game without even touching the multiplayer portion such as ; Build your own missions (scenarios). Yes, you can build your own missions once and if you get bored of the main campaign or you finish it. (2) The campaign- Now if you have the Apex DLC, you will have 2 campaigns available. I have not played the Apex campaign but the main campaign is absolutley exciting. If you are looking for a campaign similar to COD or Battlefield, then this is not for you, the missions require strategic thinking and smart tactics, you have to actually look for the enemies instead of them popping out in front of you. There is also no respawning (which some people may not like). However, you have the ability to patch yourself up after taking a non-critical hit and the game auto saves after passing certain points throughout the level. (3) Mods- Mods are a great addition to the game. You can either get Scenario mods, Campaign mods, Vehicle and Unit mods, or Game changing mods which mean they will put you through another Era in time and you can either download scenarios or campaigns with these mods. Examples of these are : Iron Front 3 for Arma, and Unsung vietnam. You can grab IFA3 here on the steam workshop, however you will have to do some searching for Unsung, it can be found on MODDB. Last but not least is Multiplayer. Now i have not played very much of the multiplayer becasue in my opinion, to really get the most out of multiplayer you should play it with friends. Now that is not to say don't play multiplayer because you dont have anyone to play it with, but communication is key in some game modes. Hope this review helped you in deciding whether or not to get this masterpiece of a game. Enjoy.
3317	1	a	Incredible game, love every bit of it, it's worth the money!! The AI are better than what I experienced with Arma 2 and Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead for sure, the physics are incredible!!!
3363	1	a	Great gameplay. Shitiest UI out of any â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game!
3194	1	a	Top shooter of all time, and developers keep on improving it.  I can't deny there are LOTS of bugs to be fixed, but it's still the best milsim game around.
545	1	a	Accidently shot some civilians in a village so i cried because it was so realistic. Then i donated 2 euros to some charity to make it even. 10/10
1372	1	a	amazing game good for pc gamers , fun and liitle bugs here and then but overall good game .
4483	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥in â¥â¥â¥â¥ balls
5037	1	a	With over a thousand hours on this game, I can say that Arma III is truly amazing. The first time I started playing this game I knew right then and there that I am going to be getting my money's worth. I was impressed on what was being shown right before my eyes when I launched the boot camp campaign tutorial. It was very immersive from the start and was that way until the end of the campaign. I recently joined a military realism/simulation unit because I wanted to get more experience in the game and learn more about the infantry before I am going to enlist in the Army. Joining this unit got me into modding this game.. alot. I will tell you this now, the game is completely different when you add a few mods. I would place this game as a nine out of ten itself, but adding mods as simple as subscribing to content from steam to downloading files from a website just breaks the scale, unlike many games. This game is capable of being a very basic training simulator in the military. Overall this is my favorite game in my steam library and most definitely recommend you get this game. I just cant wait to see whats in store for this game's future DLC's and feature to the Arma Series. Hoaah Bohemia, and HOAAH AMERICA!
3994	1	a	If you like realism and military stuff.... Just BUY this game! This game also have a tons of mod, like epoch, exile, ace, etc.
2347	1	a	A very incredible game, super realistic. With the ability to add community made mods it just adds that much more to the scope of the game. Now with the 'Zeus' functionality which allows players to edit missions on the fly it makes mission creation that much easier. This series is a game that every harcore military gamer should have in their library. The only negative to this game is the FPS drop when too many units are in an area. But thats about the only negative that I can think of.
3471	1	a	Arma 3 is in every way better than its previous version Arma 2, its still has its bugs but nothing compared to Arma 2, the Graphics are absolutely great and as always, the Gunfights are amazing, nothing like battlefield or call of duty, good planning and tactics are just as important as been able to be a good shot, exactly what you want in a tactical, Military Simulator.   From my own Experience mods are the best way to play, And I can easily see myself Putting in triple the amount of Hours that i currently have, the only reason I would stop playing Arma 3 would be if Arma 4 got released.   Only Downside is that you will need a good PC to run it, its demanding but its worth every Penny.
2013	1	a	I have no words. Boheimia Interactive has done it again, this time on an even grander and more immersive scale than the last. Alone, this game is amazing. With friends, this game is amazing. With food, this game is amazing. Masturbating, it is amazing. Did i mention that its amazing?
3579	1	a	Ook this game is speachless ...get some friends team up and let the fun begin. ;)  If you decide to buy the game then try out some Sandbox (this happens to be my favorite type of game) and the best servers if you ask me are the ws.arma.su. One more thing to say is that this is not Call of Duty this is a game where you fight for everything you need and it will take you further then COD will ever do. PS : This game is not for kids !!!
4153	0	a	Pros:  - ....  Cons:  -Horrible. Constant crashing, -Cant play ANY mod at all when ALL I EVER WHANTED was to play Epoch , Battel Royal and Wasteland Chernarus. -60$ game + 30$ for 2 chopper ? ... -100 Gig (Arma 3 + few mod install )   Wish i have some good words to the game but i Cant get a single match to function and yes i watch youtube video and all but after 3 days i still unable to run any mod.   This game only remind me my experience on DayZ.Crash after crash and bug after bug.  I made a huge mistake buying DayZ and ARMA, I will not support Bohemia Interactive anymore.
3458	1	a	KIng of hill / Altis life / battle royale / breakking point and alot of mods in ONE GAME &lt;3
5351	1	a	One of the best mil-sims / combat-sims ever made, definatly worth the $60
2841	1	a	Great for its expansive multiplayer communities and units. Bad for its underwhelming vehicles, but of course, mods make this game truly great.
1089	1	a	I Got arma 3 on sale with the dlcs and crap, loaded up the game and selected Koth (king of the hill) i played for a while and really enjoyed myself a bit later in the game i got a sniper, a ghille i was set for some sniping! went to a very popular sniper location on tanou where this log, i came to figure out could glitch you into the ground if you put your bipod on it.  I abused this alot -(sorry)  i got killed by some guy named Dan who sneaked up behind me, and watched him pick up my rifle so i knew he was going to snipe aswell so, i went back to the log and did the bipod glitch and fired 2 shots into the air so Dan, will comeback. He ended up coming back! and he brought is freind who which, i went into direct communitation and started to make wierd sounds ie -(snorting, yelling, schreeching) and he and his freind 1)shot the ground 2)threw grenades at me 3) told me to get out. i didnt, and while they where trying to kill me 2 other snipers came along and found these guys shooting at the ground, to which they murderd both Dan and his freind right about now i had fallen over laughing and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ myself, while the two snipers tea-baged Dan's dead body (rip Dan) so after there tea-baging they wanted to snipe now, these snipers didnt know about this 'glitch' and had layed to the left and right of me so, i started to make wierd noises again scaring the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of them, and while they layed there they started to try to use the bipod and got the same glitch i was in, and they soon realized that i was lying beside them so, they started to shoot the ground throw grenades and blah blah blah well, other snipers from MY team found them, and killed one of them, and the other sniper 360 noscoped one of them (no lie it was amazing) and while they where distracted i poped up out of the ground and shot 7 rounds of 9mm into his chest to which he shot me in the face with a .307. i then fellback and started to laugh very loudly and started to cry from laughing so hard and my window was open so the whole neighborhood heard me, snorting, yelling , laughing and schreehing at 1am. Arma3 best game 10/10
4524	1	a	Must buy! Sure to provide hundreds of hours of gameplay!
2394	1	a	A great game, includes lots of mods, You can join an exhilerating battle. You can roleplay your way the the top of a city or even an island. You can even use, and help your teamates in order to achieve victory. An amazing game all around.
3528	1	a	This is one of the best games i've ever played! I recommend buying this game.
4571	0	a	This sucks balls compared to A2.
3457	1	a	Arma 3 is a Massive Multiplayer action based game with TONS of activites for you to do like Roleplaying, Scavenge and kill others or team up and take over an area or making you're OWN server with whatever you wish to do. Arma 3 also is best known ofr the ammount of mods they have and they have a lot of it! Arma is a 3rd to 1st person moduale and is a very nice game to play especially with friends. I do in-courage all of you to get this game as it is a nice game to play. Although, it does have some bugs in the game and an amount of exploiters (not that many, don't worry) but set aside from that Arma 3 was worth the money.
2414	1	a	Beast game, if you have a comp to support it. If not, you can still sit in spawn and pretend you are doing something useful 10/10
4424	1	a	Most fun military game ever so many ways to play arma 3
122	1	a	Started game Set the game to ultra settings Had a gtx 660 so I changed the settings down to medium 15-40 fps, crap Buys a gtx 970 so I changed the settings to ultra 15-60 fps, crap turns settings down to lowest 15-120 fps, crap  11/10, would spends hundreds of dollars again
4612	1	a	get this  
1612	1	a	This game is probobly one of my most favourited game, the graphics are amazing, the logic is on point. The only downside to this game is that it is very poorly optimised, but if you have a high end PC you will be fine..   Buy it!
5106	0	a	As a previous ArmA player i couldn't wait to see the new technologies that were going to be used in ArmA 3. Then i played it. From a personal point of view, this game is a complete let down to the ArmA series. Yes it is enjoyable in some aspects, but it is nothing compared to ArmA 2 / OA. If you're looking for a more arcade type military game, you've found it.
2000	1	a	  THIS game needs a GOOD PC TO RUN ON
5274	1	a	good fun game with lots to do
1530	1	a	If I got stuck with one game only in my library it is this. The possibilities it offers and the community that support it make it a winner.  That said it has it's issues. Needs a strong CPU and decent to perform very well, going against the rule of thumb in modern pc gaming. Additonally there are lots of bugs and issues that still need address. Unfortunately a lot of them have existed in previous titles too. There is positive development progress all the time though.  Arma 3 aims for and achieves something which no other game does.
5256	1	a	+ realistic + loads of mods + great soundtrack + mission making + great replay value +good community  - DLCs seem kind of dull. (except for apex) - in a lot of multiplayer games FPS will drop.   Great game, but the optimization may be a deal breaker for some.
2404	1	a	All around good fun. Civ life or Arma life.
60	1	a	I have owned this game for a number of weeks now and I have been completely hooked. Great game for the more serious war gamer, not for those who prefer the fast paced combat that you get from Call of Duty series which I consider more for the younger gamers anyway.  Arma 3 moves a lot slower and is more squad based than other war games, similar to Battlefield series only slower than that when playing online and you may find yourself on 10 minute helicopter rides just to get into the battlefield and you will be highly satisfied with each kill you make as you know a single round landed by your enemy could be fatal regardless of the weapon they are using. You will have to make good use of any cover you can find and hit the dirt as soon as you hear a bullet crack over your head and then very carefully survey the surrouding area and work out where you are taking fire from as it will usually not be obvious where the fire is coming from and you will find yourself having to hold up for 10-20 minutes in a single location (sometimes longer, I personally have gotten pinned in one location for over an hour) because you are either pinned by enemy fire or it is too dangerous to move forward.  You will need to buffer up on your mic communication skills as most players use proper phonetics etc when relaying information to each other on the battlefield such as coordinates and other reconaissance.  You can not respawn as quickly as you can in CoD if you are taken down by enemy fire so staying alive is more crucial than any other war game you have played and you wanna hope you are moving up with a squad that has a medic.  The graphics are great, the game is a little glitchy at times and the controls take a little getting used to.  I recommend buying this game to any serious war game enthusiasts who want to get as close to war as possible (unless doing paintballing or airgunning), and if you do buy the game - I recommend completing the whole VR Tutorial before actually joining a server or playing the Campaign as you will need to really learn all those different keys that may make the difference in a hairy situation in game.
4999	1	a	Real War ;3
2774	1	a	This game lead me to my breakup as i gave more time to it than my bae :D Its worth it :D
3675	1	a	This game contains so much because of the mods     it's awesome
534	1	a	I killed a man with 0 thought.... found out he was friendly then I was running away rouge with the threat of being court marshalled held over my head. Then I found this great game and now I play it.  10/10 would shoot sarge again.
3448	1	a	Arma is a great game to simulate combat. This game contains a bunch or military tactics weapons and movements you can think of.  the military tactics include basic training, staying low profile and taking care of eachother. In multiplayer, the medic class can be very useful if used correctly. BUT that goes for every class, not just the medic.  The weapons are very nicely designed. The look fantastic, they even have those hybrid scopes (The ones with a scope, and ontop a micro red dot sight or RDS). The only problem that everyone runs into - which is intentionally implemented in the game - the shortage of ammo. You can just spray and pray. No if you do that, your â¥â¥â¥â¥ed.  The movements are really realistic too. It's overlooked, but if used the right way, they can be the difference between life and death. In one situtation (this gets a bit off topic for a sec) we had a teammate who at the beginning killed our entire team. We all spawned in, he waited and deployed his bipod, and killed like 20 of us. When this was happening the enemy was getting the upper hand. We were all killing him and people turned on eathother, and somehow we picked up our â¥â¥â¥â¥ and faught the enemy, who had spawn trapped us. The advanced movements allowed me and 1 other person to roll in the grass to the left flank, got behind them and killed a pretty good amount, which allowed our team to push in and capture the base.  In conclusion, it's a great game. BUT way to difficult for me. The controls are a bit complicated to me; I'm used to Battlefield and CoD. This game is FANTASTIC but I hate to say it, but the realism is too much for me :/ I refunded it but Do NOT hesitate to buy this product. Always remember, there's always the refund button.  I did buy it again then forget to close it, now I cant refund anymore, lol its a cool game though.
3271	1	a	AwSome!!!
1823	1	a	Probably one of my favorite games of all time. There is just so much do, even without mods there is hundreds of hours worth of content! 10/10 highly recommend!
1106	1	a	This game is really beautiful on Max Settings. Even on low settngs, the game is still visually impressive.The gameplay also is very good and smooth, especially when you jump down some stairs and appear on the roof of a building!  10/10
3934	1	a	We made a convoy. I like convoys 11/8 Would convoy again
1299	1	a	Playing campaign, get killed by a random mortar shell, restart from last checkpoint, proceed to run 500 meters, get shelled to pieces, repeat.  3/3
2164	1	a	It's pretty good.  Ladders are still death traps.
2476	1	a	Amazing. Best game I ever saw! It's a must in the video games world!
4067	1	a	Top notch game,especially with Altis and Wastelands. 10/10 would recommend again.
2922	1	a	You Couldn't even run this with the matrix.
2778	1	a	has been playing this game from v1.14 pirated version so my actual hours I spent was more than 1,5k hours maybe. Bought the legit copy on 2015, worth the full price but I'm just broke lol.   The game itself is basically a sandbox with many potential scenarios and situations the only limits was your imagination and your will. Once you finished the campaign you probably trying any casual gameplay like Wasteland, Altis Life, Exile etc. Or if you like zombies you might like Breaking Point, Exile with Zombies, and many variation of them until you don't even know what do you want to play. So much things to do.  Or if you into realism or immersion of military simulation, you can join any Unit and play like actual soldier in battlefield following some protocols, radio and â¥â¥â¥â¥. It maybe sound so serious but trust me it was fun. There are many things you don't expect to be happen but turns out it was a hilarious experience with your teammates or some dumb acts someone did makes you laugh.  For regular player you might found Arma have complicated action button on the keyboard, a lot of it but you will get used to it. And Arma have REALLY BIG maps like, dude it was 20km square ! people sometimes joking about it called 'asthmatic jogging simulator' because you will mostly run one to other place very often. even running 1km take a few minutes on foot. But if you playing a scenario mission it wont be matter as long as you put some vehicle in advantage point and keep the immersive gameplay.  what its good about Arma ? its THE MODS. the community keeps growing and there is some awesome authors put their effort and times making cool mods like new maps, new weapon and etc. You may ended up having mod running 50gb on your disk.  Lets talk about downside. Some people complaining about its performance on multiplayer like having very low fps although you running a monster pc race. Well, basically arma is calculating everything ingame, your character, the environment, weather, time, bullet trajectory, ambient sound, animation, AI, etc. It's not suprised if you lagging if you put too much mod and a heavily scripted mission because the server or your pc calculating every script on air and sync it to every player, so if the server have 40 player on it its like the server have 40 time load than regular one. Its logical i think but I hope BIS would improve their coding so we have a better fps on multiplayer.  Also if you even enter the forums.bistudio, many people complaining about BIS didn't looking after problem that existed but focusing on adding new feature. Well, there is some demand from player to fix some their basic feature I hope they listen to their community.   So overall verdict from me:  Graphics : 7.5/10 (gettings better) Sound : 8.5/10 (just like real life) Gameplay : 8/10 (just what I am into) Overall : 8/10 (recommended for you if you like gameplay like arma)
4825	1	a	Fantastic and has a great community and Life mod
3990	1	a	  A3 compared to A2 had strong and weak sides: good things are: new engine. more offloading to GPU among GFX things atleast(and DX10 support, btw. DX12 promised in Tanoa). new editor. somewhat rehauled/reworked core modules, generally 'for good'. bad/disapointing things are: less content. gear, vehicles, features ingame. ugly setting in stock package, both art, islands, vehicles collection, 'alternative future' era touch with bat[cenzored]crazy opinions about that 'future' in terms of miltech state of. but thats more about personal taste. but choice about 'sunset' as editor default perhaps Good thing. AI and physics code not really scalable/multicore(thanks' to intel libraries and lack of message-passing code(developers with ada/smalltalk/haskell/erlang experience is rare asset to sieze) and one-sided profiling of binaries. even more obvious/eye-wrapping/scratching post-processing. but not uniform 'bloom' as in A2, but DoF and color-based things 'console'-style and generally DayZ-alike 'casualisation' isn't thing i welcome in Arma, frankly-speaking. no 64-binaries(and A3 dataset is HUGE. even w/o serious(and A2/A3 may look truly Beatiful with it and aircrafts playable)viewdistance and mide or small-sized islands with huge gridsstep. despite persistent modders efforts to fix most obvious gaps(like decent islands, gear, etc)generally major flaws was engine(it buit atop)itself and incomplete(or incoherent with)documentation(i Do really miss OFP:R-era Very documented engine/syntax, examples, references), tools/sdk(especially landscape editor, perhaps). so after DX12 most important things for A3 would be: putting 64-bit engine(for both client AND server)into actions, making A3 really-multithreading or better relying about Message-passing code(preferably over some ERlang code, perhaps. considering scalability advantages even against other MP-langs or MP-libs/wrappers to overcome)especially in AI code(most stress, even in ~ short battles/matches). generally i would recommend A3. but not for casual gamers. if you one of newbie in milsim or even in action games at all - you may be disapointed/frustrated at first time or even angry(if you read some reviews - you may had expressions of). its game for gamers really Knowing what they need and why. cuz most fun in A3 rolled over three things: teamplay, challenge, replayabliliy. and editability/moddabiliy.(but it worth another, separated review i guess).
630	1	a	Much good game, very fun role play servers and some good coop servers. you can drive tanks and â¥â¥â¥â¥ and even fly jets. Quite realistic.  Try to avoid any |GITS| owned servers as they are the most biased and power abusing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ on the whole of the game. Their servers are very not good.   420/10 - IGN
38	1	a	Online play is toxic, but fun. Camapaign is fine. Great for LAN parties if that's even still a thing.
1761	1	a	Great and a fun game.
2673	1	a	You can be a rabbit 10/10
2267	1	a	Amazing game if you give it a chance and tinker with it. Mods ALiVE and ACE (When released) especially has changed this game for the better don't knock it for the odd issue here or there the community are the guys who make this game really shine.   Only advice I can offer is get part of a community to really enjoy this game after all the makers gave us the sandbox but its the community who make the sandcastles out of this game!
3686	1	a	The. Best. Game. Ever.     *Drops mic*
4395	1	a	TL;DR:  Easily the most realistic military game I've played. Definitely much better than the previous games. It's best to wait for a sale, however.   Pros:  -Very strong creation engine -Notable Mods/Community -Descent Graphics -Very realistic bullet physics/aiming -Strong campaign  Cons:  -Not the most optimized game ever -Slow-paced (but that's to be expected) -Sub-par infantry animations -A few notable bugs (especially in the AI)  9/10 Overall
3335	1	a	Is very good game. Lot of ruski. â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
4152	1	a	This is a game where you shoot things and they die. Almost like real life. Except its not real life.
3693	1	a	Great game, it doesn't matter if you want to shoot a gun, fly a jet or drop troops off in a helo. You can dowhatever you want in this game. There are even mods to go fishing...imagine that!  I will update this when I have the time, I have to play some more. Gotta get up to 2000 hours to meet target set by other players.
4500	1	a	If you like sandbox games and especially military sandbox you have to play Arma 3, but if you're bad at games that require tactics or you think this is CSGO you should not buy this game. Personally I did not enjoy this game because for me it is pretty boring or maybe has no action, but you decide. However I recomend Arma 3.
138	1	a	I've always meant to write a review for this game, after spending 1,700 hours in it. God knows how many hours I've spent on Arma 2. Anyways, this is one of the best games I've ever played. While I might describe this as a game, I consider this as more of an engine. Why?   Because games often restrict you to a lore, a path, tools, programed in a way without giving you the chance to explore other possibilities; they want you to experience what they want you to experience. For this game, it's different - you can choose to be a common soldier in the Vietnam war. You can choose to be a helicopter pilot in the war in Iraq. Whatever theatre, faction, weapon, uniform you fancy, there are often mods for it.   So forget about how badly optimized this game is, because the fact is with how vast the possibilities this game opens you to, you really are pushing the boundaries of this engine. People often complain about how badly optimized this game is, and at the same time complain about the lack of free will in other games. This game has the latter, so appreciate it for what it is.   The community is one of the best out there. But because of the influx of new players, also be wary of who you might run into.
5396	1	a	everyone need to try out this game
3050	1	a	An excellent military simulator, has a large learning curve and requires patience inorder to to become skilled at. Like most multiplayer games, Arma 3 works ALOT better with friends becuase it allos for you to have more coordination, which is a very important factor in Arma 3. Its fairly system intensive , but has gone through alot of optimiztion patches, but you should still look into the system requirements before purchasing. I would highly reccomend it, especially if you have friends to play it with.
1629	1	a	Altis and Stratis life are the best part about this game in my opinion. Also the editor, spawning in jets or helis and flying them around. In Altis life, my helicopter got stolen after I tried to say 'Hello!' to some guy in a ghillie. He asked for me keys so I just gave up there...
4037	1	a	There are lots of bugs and poor design choices, that's for sure. The graphics aren't that great and the game runs like crap (sometimes 25 fps on my top end system). The game can also be really boring and frustrating (like when you get stuck on rocks and have to restart a 2 hour mission).  That said, I definitely recommend this game for someone who's tired of the same ol arcade shooters. Before I played Arma, I thought Battlefield 3 was a military simulator (lel). This game is nothing like call of duty. In arcade shooters like CoD, there's tons of action, all the time, and it gets mind numbing. In Arma, action is pretty infrequent, but when it does happen it's really intense and unforgiving. The missions are also very sandbox; you can plan out your own strategies instead of just running through ACTIONPACKED!!!!!, repetitive levels.  It's a hard game to learn. It uses almost every button on the keyboard. To this day I still don't know how to do some things, such as use laser guided bombs. If you're looking for a challenging, intense 'true pc game' you can't go wrong with Arma III.
3840	1	a	Just get it, seriously.
2186	1	a	Pretty fun game if you are looking for a pretty true to life simulator
3703	1	a	This game is best enjoyed with some mods that add extra realism on top of the game already being quite realistic. It is by far one of the best Army simulators out there and will remain so for a while.
2235	1	a	Singleplayer is an exercise in pain on high difficulty. Game overwrites autosaves and limits you to 1 save. Prepare your body for an autosave with grenade launcher rounds inbound forcing you to restart. Great roguelikelike.
2185	1	a	Nice game. If you know how to play it.
1469	1	a	Can't join any servers anymore. 10/10 wouldn't join again!
2402	1	a	this is a great game. only got it about a week ago and ever since ive been playing it nonstop... great animations. only question is how to download Takistan Life?
1600	1	a	This game â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sucks nuts
881	1	a	Arma has a love hate relationship, but overall is a fantastic game.
4387	1	a	I don't know what to write because there is so much stuff to do in this game, so I write this.
5261	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game â¥â¥â¥â¥ my life im killing myself! ps this game always freezes!  *died*
3509	1	a	Just like Human Centipede, this game is medically and scientifically accurate.  Just like Apollo 13, you will have a lot of problems.  Just like Shakespeare, it will end in tragedy. Just like NASA, you will not have enough funds to continue missions. Just like your grandma, you will end up as ashes. Just like Boy Meets World... except face first. Just like Die Hard: With a Vengeance... except no vengeance.  Just like a Japanese Kamikaze pilot... except unintentional. Just like your girlfriend's virginity... all will be lost. Just like gay marriage... you will eventually get close. Just like an adopted baby, you will long for reuniting with mother moon.  Just like a failed marriage, you wonder where it all went wrong. Just like an Islam extremist, you will scream prior to your death. Just like a cookie, you will crumble. Just like Selena Gomez, you will have one good hit, but can't replicate it no matter how hard you try. Just like a crazed sociopath Jebediah will ALWAYS smile, whether he's being thrown into the sun or on a fire-reentry back into Kerbin Orbit. - (Cobalt Lightning) Just like you have Alzheimers, you will forget your parachute - (Austin) Just like war, It never changes. - (Dr. Strangelove)  Just like Peppi you'll use the boost to get through. - (Kodiak) Just like Falco there will be something wrong with the G-diffuser Just like Slippy, 'Help me.....help me!' Just like a large burrito. It looks delicious, but always ends up a terrible mess. Just like a Stormtrooper you'll never hit your target Unlike Luke Trusting your instincts will get you killed Unlike Star Wars, the only force you need to be concerned about is Mass X Acceleration Just like a necromancer, you'll have absolutely no life - (Kodiak) Just Like North Korea, The Rocket will never launch - (Sir Panda) Just like a Space Marine, we call it Steel Rain - (Kill-Cam Celebrity) Just like Skyrim, your steed will only be able to fly for minutes at a time Just like SimCity, you'll quickly learn your building skills are â¥â¥â¥â¥ Just like a Scout, Jebediah runs fast and dies a virgin - (Kill-Cam Celebrity) Just like your mom's house, one mistake and you're out - (Kill-Cam Celebrity) Just like Russia. You can only love it or hate it. - (Selina Kyle) Just like EA, you promote it as a good thing, but it turns out to be a bad thing - (NOSCOPE) just like a Steam sale, you will use the funds that you don't have. - (Broccoli) Just Like Adventure Time, Grab your friends &amp; go to very distant lands. - (Kanjzo) Just like IPhone 6, It will bend. - (Kanjzo) Just like this review, f*cking â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, dude - (Chris Atkins) Just like a bomb ...

777	1	a	Its a very good game,has a great easy to use editor,good mod supports. the game has a bit of a learning curve but its not that big. over all its a wonderful game
1642	1	a	A very good military tactical simulator with a highly changing dynamic enviroment :D Thanks Bohemia soo much for making such a great game!
4638	1	a	Good game, the freedom of choice to play multiple game modes. Spent way to many hours playing life servers.
4809	1	a	I suggest waiting for it to come on sale, then it is definitely worth it. I will forwarn you, the game does not really seem complete at purchase. However, the modding community is amazing and their mods have not ceased in amazing me. I would strongly suggest the mods that add the old arma 2 units and maps (MARSOC and Spetznaz maybe on armaholic for units?). It is really great to go back and see these remastered maps, then playing on them with the updated engine.... WHEW BOY, thats some good stuff. Id say that finding people to play with is really important too, I dont do the altis life games, but i have friends that do and they enjoy it. Finding squads that are nice enough to allow pubbies on are generally the way to go. If you will be playing MILSIM, then for the love of all that is good.... GET TASK FORCE ARROWHEAD RADIO! It will enhance the gameplay experience tenfold. The only real con to it is that sometimes good games are few and far between, but the time you spend to find one is well worth the reward when you get to play! Make sure to star it in your server list. I am not a part of a squad, but if you really want to boost your gameplay, then i would strongly suggest it.  Overall, Im not impressed by BI's work, but moreso the modders. (AND TO ALL THE MODDERS OUT THERE... THANK YOU :D) If you wanna game thats run and gun, this isnt for you. If you wanna game that will challenge you and put your skills to the test, this is it. I will honestly say one thing that pisses me off more than anything is the AI's accuracy, but it is possible to change. Nothing like getting capped in the head by and AI with a pistol 45 yards away...  I would definitely recommend it to people who are tired of COD or BF, or are like me and never really liked those other two in the first place because I jumped into arma :P Enjoy it and have some good times, you may even make a friend along the way!
2787	1	a	Its a cool realistic game! i love it!
1404	1	a	damn this is good
2554	1	a	The long awaited sequel to ArmA 2 is finally here! It brings what made the previous titles great into a modern military shooter with more features than you could possibly mention in a short review. Worth full retail price and a must buy when on sale.

811	1	a	This game is fantastic. Infact it is the most immersive game I have ever played. I realized this when me and some random person I met found each other on a wasteland server and survived by the skin of our teeth, savenging items, raiding towms, and dying a little too many times in the varied and colorful landscape of Altis. This is only just a small part of the game that I happened upon, so believe me when I say that I can't wait to discover the rest of it.
640	1	a	Great
3925	1	a	This is one of the most complicated FPS games to play, as in there are a lot of control you need to learn to make your character move around in a organized way. Once you learn them however, the games becomes very fun, and difficult. So if you dont like a challenge this game is not for you. Some parts of the campaign I had to try (on regular) at least 20-30 times. Im a decent FPS player but is like no other I've played.   The game itself is very nice to look at, albeit not as optimized as I would like to see. It is also very heavility CPU based. My OC 4790k hovers around 20-50% usage, sometimes going into the high 60s. I play on very high at 5760x1080 and get around 55-70 fps on average with 970 SLI.   The gameplay is very different then any other game. The audio and realism is very good. Sometimes you really think you are a soldier and get scared when you are walking and suddenly hear bullet impacts near you. The gunplay is also very hard and challenging. You have to really be slow and careful on where you are how you plan to engage the enemy. Because they are very good shots and you die very easily. So you have to be strategic in everything you do. Which can be really fun.   This also is not a non-stop action game. There is a lot of walking and exploring. This is like a COD polar opposite.   Mods and custom content really add to the replayability and fun of this game. The fun never stops when you have all of the steam workshop and a few friends to play with.   Some things did bother me and broke the realism for me. One being that a nice combat simulator like this with accurate gun behaviors and recoil doesnt even have 2 different reload animations for guns, or when reloading when not empty you don't get 30+1. Also there is not very good animation in this game, reload, talking, and some player animation is not very smooth or realistic in many cases.   Overall I give it a 8/10 for what it was planning/supposed to be and how I received it.
1835	1	a	It was k
3236	1	a	Great MilSim, love it.
425	1	a	It's a beautiful game. !!
4931	1	a	This game is outstanding it has so much more things u can do in it and its only in beta right now. So i can just imagine how good it will be when it comes out fully. 
3456	1	a	AI killed me with a rocket from 1000 meters while driving at high speed on Exile 10/10 would get blown up again
4547	1	a	Honestly the best game ive ever played.
172	1	a	Downloaded Arma, and then opened it. Proceeded to do a horrible tutorial, but after that, it was just beautiful. Opened an RPG server, and ran 2 miles to get to an atm, and ran 2 miles to a shady car salesman. Bought a car, spent the next half hour trying to figure out how to actually get into it. After I finally managed to glitch into it, I underestimated it's ability to travel at light speed, which in turn caused me to crash into a wall. After that, my car was a smoking mess, with a top speed that a sloth could outdo.  10/10 would crash again
4538	1	a	Must play game!
4616	1	a	Pros - This is by far my go to PC game of all time. Are you looking for a gaming experience like no other? Then go with Arma. I've been an Arma veteran for awhile, and don't regret any minute I've put into the game. Yes you do need a somewhat powerful PC to get the best Arma experience, but the community and the people that you will meet while playing the game are what makes it amazing. Check out the video I linked below with some 'Wasteland' gameplay with friends I've met through playing the game! Hope this helped!   https://youtu.be/EZHJVrx7wX8   Cons - Controls are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, and not as optimized as it could be.
1794	1	a	Difficulty. Complex. Un-optimezed â¥â¥â¥â¥ that sucks you in.  Buy it!
4993	1	a	If you want a game where you can â¥â¥â¥â¥ around and have fun then this is it.
745	1	a	This is the definitive shooter. Forget Call of Duty, forget Battlefield, this is leagues beyond those titles. From fighting as a lone wolf to supporting a team of seventy-two other players on land, above or below seas, and in the sky, everything feels just as it should, just as it would be if it were real. For those that love beutiful visuals, sharp skill curves, and of course, Bohemia's trademark realism, this title cannot be missed.
3379	1	a	played a little bit and its just, mehh, just ok
4482	1	a	it is a good game i love it
240	1	a	Updated engine with a hell of a lot of potential. Buy it as a long term investment.
5161	0	a	Waste of money. Nobody in their right mind should purchase this game. When looking at the recommended settings to run the game, disregard them. It is all lies and cannot run. Poor game choice for those who may find it fun. Rating: .5-10
1087	1	a	I purchased Arma 3 when it was in Alpha. I have more time in Arma 3 than any other game in my library, at just under 1300 hours, aka, about 53 days. I imagine that with these stats alone, I'd have a good idea of what the game has to offer.  Arma 3 is of course the pinacle of the series so far, with new Tech, massive maps, and a solid founding based in years of experience. With the release of APEX, my love for this game has only increased. I found the Coop campaign to be fresh, if not a little short. My major concern with this game, is it's timeline. I hate futuristic crap, the guns feel fake, and the vehicles are boring.  Thankfully, Arma has enjoyed one of the best modding communities in online gaming. With teams like RHS, and the guys behind ACE, the futuristc crapshoot that was Arma, suddenly becomes a modern conflict with amazing scale. With groups like Shacktac putting out constant content, there's something for everyone.   Arma 3's greatest strength is by far it's community. From Milsim Units like 7CAV, to private servers hosting the Iron Front 1944 Mod, to King of the Hill, there is always someone online ready to throw down with you.  Fantastic Game. By Far my Favorite PC Game Ever. 10/10.
2440	1	a	This game is almost the perfect PC game (in my oppinion) however it would be great if the game ran a little bit better but apart from that you can mod the living â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of it and spend hundreds of hours playing the various life mods!  12/10 - ME :D
3894	1	a	i bought this game for $60 and the next day there was a 50% off sale. Not even mad about it.  11/10
4865	1	a	Definetly a very fun game. The recent DLC that they released, Apex, I think is slightly over priced, and you should wait for the price to go down or for it to go on sale, but it's also worth it. A lot of work went into this game and is a lot of fun with friends. There are a lot of awsome mods for this game that really add to this game's worth, as well as a lot of fun life servers. But it can get kind of lonely without friends to play with, so defnetly consider that. I would give it a 9/10.
973	1	a	GET THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥ING GAME GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY
5322	1	a	You can do stuff in this game
4272	1	a	Great game, love it.  Problems with helicopters and its blades, might have been updated but still a great game (And car hitpoints are messed, so if you ram someone in the back your tires go =/ )
279	1	a	One of the best games ever got alot of hours on it
4823	1	a	TL;DR: Pros: -Extreme realism (damage, movement, fatigue, healing, equipment, ect...) -(sink or swim) training of very valuable combat skills used in real life and useful in other games -very useful AI companions (most of the time) -everything has a counter and can be taken down with the right equipment and/or exceptional skill and/or lucky shots Cons: -Extreme difficulty (probably harder than darksouls at times, save often between engagements and stay with your team) -Characters occasionally feel emotionally stunted -obvious 'god mode' NPC sometimes (coughcoughfirstmissioncoughcough)  Too Long;Read it anyway:  One of the most realistic warfighter simulators to date. As such, it's also difficult to the point where anyone who plays a 'standard' FPS will quickly die due to lack of caution. Everything is simulated to an extreme degree from the problems associated with exaustion and fatigue resulting in slower movement and trouble aiming, to the reality of taking fire causing tunnel vision, realistic injuries, and extremely quick death.   One of the first lessons you will learn in this game is to keep your head down and look for cover. Always be looking for ways to find your enemies before they find you and never take any advantage for granted. The second someone knows where you are before you know where they are, you are at a crippling disadvantage as it is all too easy to line up a steady shot and kill someone before they even knew you where there. A good way to learn just how scary it is on the modern battlefield today for anyone involved since you'll find yourself relying on your AI and player teammates almost more than you rely on your own skills. You might find yourself actually following around the AI for cues and clues on how to fight and the level of communication between both players and the AI allies is far above what most games have ever accomplished on a practical level. Simply put, this game has NPCs that you may actually find a bit of value in compared to the inaccurate, incompetent, prescripted 'spehshul farces' NPCs you see in other games  The actual campaign is pretty good too, giving you a good look (in my opinion) of what combat arms guys would actually deal with in a desprate situation (out numbered and out gunned in a hostile foriegn country with little in the way of support) I wont tell you how things got this way, but right from the start, the entire remaining NATO forces (in that particular area of operations) are hanging on by a thread and fighting a larger, albiet less experianced, local military and it's extremely satisfying to survive each mission and see the desperate struggle continue.   Now as great as the AI is in this game, it's not without it's flaws. They are skilled, but occasionally have path finding issues in vehicles that make you wonder who gave these guys their license. In the campaign, occasionally the 'god mode' will kick in and reveal that the character is obviouslly story critical before they actually are but it's rare enough that you won't be annoyed by it long and chances are that you'll be too busy trying to stay alive to notice it.   There is also the fact that I think that maybe they could have increased the emotional factor by allowing the characters to grieve a bit more over the loss of their buddies during and after combat, as sometimes it feels a little cold that they just ignore it other than a call out that someone's down. You see it effect them every once in a while for certian characters but really it seems they either aren't really feeling it right then or are really good at not showing it which is something that legitimately happens so I find it forgivable for the devs to have not made the call outs for each death a little more emotional. There is another factor I think could play into why they can keep it to '(number) is down' but for spoiler sake, I won't say that theory here.
5302	1	a	ArmA 3 is the definitive warfare simulator.  
139	1	a	'The best sandbox war game of the year'  Arma 3 is a continuation to the Arma series by Bohemia Interactive, taken to the next level. With increased player control/movement, enhanced mechanics for vehicles, weapon systems (if you buy it), flight models (if you buy it -_-), and much more! The control in tight spaces should be worked on, this is no call of duty, the controls are clunky, but are a vast improvement over the previous installment (arma 2). Another of the top complaints of this game is the NETCODE. It is terrible under load, but again, is much better than arma 2.   This game is mostly open source, Meaning that players are able to change almost every aspect of the game from the amount of fog to adding dinosuars into the game. The things you can do are endless and that is it's selling point. Bohemia Interactive leaves the imagining to you and the community to come up with your own story or missions. This game is heavily supported by the modding community and for good reason. The scripting language for ARMA 3 is .sqf, Based off the C++ coding language, but it seems like a little of everything works. (there is alot of things you can do to make somehting work) I have based 4 years of my life modding and playing arma 2 and arma 3, making this my most played game, by a long shot.  The best way to play this game is modded and with friends. By it's self, arma is fun, but somewhat bland, but that seems like that was part of the plan... BI (Bohemia Interactive) made the game as basic as possible to allow you and it's users to change it the way they like it!   Do I recommend this game?  YES!   This game has supplied my friends and I countless hours of playtime with new and exciting missions and firefights, and with a few basic mods it has become 400% better than before.   9.2/10
3639	1	a	very good open world shooter
4469	1	a	Great game
3012	1	a	I once threw an assault boat into a town from a chinock and it landed on a tank and blew it up.  Buy the game...
2428	1	a	Arma 3 is a very diverse game with many different games modes and mods. Some of the popular gamemodes are King of the Hill, Battleroyale, and Wasteland. There are also many co-operative mission you can do with people if you choose to do so. You can instlal different mods like guns, vehicles, missions and other things. Then theres Breaking Point a mod that involves zombies (be warned it is a very big download like 20+ GB) it can be hard to survive people and most people will try to kill you so be warned. Last note is there is going to be a Arma 3 Epoch Namalsk map coming.
2644	1	a	plays wasteland server for 3 days straight and has every gun, armor piece and driveable piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ in game. goes on next day to find its all been stolen. 10/10 would buy new break hand destroying moniter again
3814	1	a	it crashes more often than Paul Walker but except from that its okay  see you again/10
146	1	a	Ruins your social life.  So many mods to play. So much gamemodes to play.  Dont buy this game if you want a social life.  Trust me... It's too late for me.  20/10 would glitch in rock again
4174	1	a	Owned the game for 2 months and have never looked back... Great game
4128	1	a	Just yes! If you loved ArmA 2 you're going to love this!
2734	1	a	Still a few bugs, bouncy servers and could need a better server browser, but Arma 3 is a very good upgraded compared to earlier releases, and one of the best 'simulators' out there. The community keeps this up and running, and their doing a good job.
2436	1	a	Don't mistake this game for an FPS, some people enter into this game expecting COD ...it's not. ARMA is a full battlefield simulator which it does well at. In ARMA you're not meant to feel invincible, if you don't take cover you'll die, if you don't communicate with your squad you'll die. It has an insane learning curve that will take most people a long time to get used to, but only makes it very satisfying once you finally figure out how to fly or use artillery or...anything. The complicated controls at first can seem annoying but once you're used to them you'll be grateful you can stick your head up just enough to see an enemy out of a window without exposing your whole body.  The games mod-ability makes it possible to play an infinite array of game modes making it difficult to get truly boring. While there is a battlefield like mod called king of the hill the size of the maps alone makes the game vastly more complex and that's saying nothing of the array of vehicles that can completely alter the game from just one player knowing how to fly or range a sniper rifle.   Unfortunately the ARMA engine is well known for how glitchy it can get, Most of this has been ironed out and the presence of hackers ruining servers has been greatly reduced since early access. At times clipping through a wall or falling through the floor of a building still happens but it's not so common that it ruins things.  At the end of the day the game requires being patient and on your toes while communicating what you see with teammates. The different mods and game modes give the game infinite potential but the glitches can create issues sometimes. ARMA 3 is a military sim not 'insert FPS here' don't get attached to scores and if you find yourself complaining over global that someone using a plane is 'cheap' or a 'noob' close the game and reevaluate who you want to be in life.
4091	1	a	Decent game wait for sales to buy... :3
3353	1	a	This review is for a badge but this is still a GREAT GAME!
3074	1	a	Game is very fun. Very realistic shooter game with many different community made game modes. I recommend getting some mods such as tactical battlefield or arma 3 life
1758	1	a	Large improvement over arma 2, still needs work tho in my humble opinion. And optimisation! rolling it on a mid range system produces less than playable results exactly when you need it to run smoothly the most: multiplayer firefights. There's something inherently wrong with the way you program your game engines guys. Probably make a better game engine, one that handles all the stuff it ha to do in a smart way, so you don't need a top of the line PC to play on medium quality! All in all, it's worth buying. Not going to improve much in the areas it suffers, because they are tied in with the game engine, but as technomogy catches up, it will be fun to play the mods people are making for this, just like dayz was... without the cheaters hehe. Props to Rocket for that one, but dayz standalone is still a total fail...
2833	1	a	This is a awesome game! It's a Army Simulation based game with no white dot on the screen to help you hip fire, you won't be seeing much of that. The vehicles are smooth with a steady internet connection. I would recommend that you practice your flying skills on single player to get the hang of it so when your in battle with 8 guys in the back you know what your doing.
3782	1	a	Fantastic game. This has come on leaps and bounds form Arma 2.   Beautiful graphics, challenging combat, and a good variety of missions in the campaign.
1429	1	a	Fun open world game. A lotof mods to choose from. Well worth the money
141	1	a	A great simulator of my home country, Alpacastan. I appreciate the correct modelling of Alpacastanians, and there wonderful law-enforced attire of blue striped shirts, hats, tan shorts, and sandals. I also love the fact that you can recreate traditional Alpacastanian picnics within this great simulator. It always brings tears to my eyes to remember the death of my grandfather, Backwards Cap Guy- he was hit by a car, and then shot by a spy during the Great Cleansing of Stan.  RIP, he will be missed.  11 frolicks out of 10.
3946	1	a	Awesome game love this game :D
1687	1	a	Best game ever can shoot coons in the dome with a tank or even a little pea shooter rate 9/11 outa good.
228	1	a	I've never encountered a better military simulation game. It goes beyond 'shooter' when played with a good realism cooperative group, with some good missions. Excellent title.
3240	1	a	  Arma III; great game, but...  Arma III checks all the boxes for a simulation. Incredible graphics, massive scope, high level of detail, everything a person would want for a simulation. The short time I played it, I was blown away by its realism. Therein, lies the problem.  Arma III continues a trend I noticed first with the Gran Turismo series of games. GT2 was an fun game to play. A little cartoonish with the graphics and not entirely accurate to real life, but it was real enough to enjoyable. Since then, the Gran Turismo games have become more realistic and I'm in awe everytime a trailer comes out. I haven't bought a game since GT3. GT3 wasn't fun to play, it was too real. The cars required a level of control that I couldn't provide using a controller and TV screen. This is the same issue I have with Arma.  The first time my character died, I think I was receiving fire from in front of me. Each time after that, I couldn't tell you where I was being shot from. After the 10th or 15th time, enough was enough. It was very realistic, and very frustrating. No feedback from my speakers, or anything on screen to indicate where the enemy was. Effectively, I was being punished for playng a computer game on a computer. WASD and a mouse werenot enough for me to play this game.  To sum up:  If you enjoy shooters like Halo or Doom, this might not be for you.  If you were frustrated by the unforgiving nature of MS Flight Simulator, this game is definitely NOT for you.  If you have a thing for playing the most realistic games available, this is the game for you!
1056	1	a	This is my first review. Arma 3 is one of the most realistic military sim you'll play in awhile. The realism beats battlefield, but is slower. At first if you're not use to it you will wonder how you died. After awhile you will realize that you were shot around 500 meters away. ARMA 3 is for the players who want more realism than battlefield.The game has many positives and some negatives that I can note.  Positives: + Amazing graphics in some places + Big maps (2 really big islands, with one about 270km squared) +A decent amount of vehicles / weapons  +Alot of uniforms for player customization (using the virtual ammo box, that is present in some servers) + A very good editor and a real time edior named zeus (now 3D) + Life like situations with other players + No annoying kids like in Call Of Duty Negatives: - The campaign does leave an impression - The AI downright has no IQ - Needs a good computer - The map ,though big, some places is really just open land (unless is apex then trees everywhere) - Hard to learn The game has it's shares of positives and negatives, but will not be like any other game you've ever played. Don't buy this game if you won't take the time to learn how to play. That is because it will overwhelm you if you perfer games like Call of Duty.
3373	1	a	TL;DR: Very good game. Get it if its not already in your library. If it is in your library get it for a friend.  This game is a very solid entry in the Arma franchise. It improves upon Arma 2 in every way besides content. But that is even made up for in mods. If youve played Arma 2 and enjoyed it, then youll love this. If you havent played any Army before, youll still love this. It is a must buy. But ill explain why that is my review.  Pros: -This game has very good graphics and well optimised -I would go as far to say this is the most 'realistic' combat game out there -There is loads of content in the Steam Workshop for many hours of fun and tons of mods and game modes -The PvP is simply the best PvP in any game Ive ever played, and Ive played a lot of games -Compared to the last Arma it improves in all areas (besides content- Ill cover that in the Cons) -There is very few squeakers and trollers, and it has a mature player base.  -New inventory system is very well done -The sound in this game is amazing.   Cons: -It will absolutely â¥â¥â¥â¥ your PC. You need a good graphics card to run this game. (It runs like a champ if you have a good card) -Lack of weapons and vehicles. (But it makes up for it by having a great attatchment system) -This is not for impatient people. Nearly every mission will have you walk at least 1km. (I dont find this a Con, but I imagine most FPS players would)  Final rating would be 9/10. Simply because it requires a very good rig to run it well.
3348	1	a	My team died. I was all alone. I had managed to kill many of the enemy. When the path to the objective seemed safe and clear, I made a run for it.  *BOOM* A grenade launcher shot blew up right next to me.  I fell out of my chair in fear and had to take off my headset to make sure I was still alive.  10/10 would cry again 
4163	1	a	If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.  Ingredients: 1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie   Directions: 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.
5123	0	a	First off i have to say i HATE Multiplayer games. they are not fun for me in the slightest. just a bunch of idiots modding to win. so i never tried the multiplayer.  I got this for the Singleplayer, and i have to say it sucks. its far too scripted. i cant do any thing my way i have to stand here.. stand there... listen to some idoit talk and curse for half a hour when he could just say it over the radio whilst i walk or drive so i am not so bored with the crappy dialogue, but no... It's BORRING.  Even when i actually got to shoot half a hour later... the gun physics are so lame i laughed and shortley after quit and uninstalled it. If you shoot a rifle at 50 metres square at a target the size of a torso, the bullet will hit it, but in this so called SIM it won't most of the time. Guns just are not that unaccrate. shotguns have spread not rifles. a rifle at 50 metres will be 1 cm each way tops not 50 cm. that alone is enough for me to quit and uninstall it and NEVER play it again.
1338	1	a	pls add swords to this game.
3124	1	a	it is the best game i have ever played and i am glad to have it.
1719	1	a	Was a sniper in a wasteland convoy with a 50. Cal   Saw a chopper get shot down and fall into a death spin then crash in my face like in the movies  Has what is possibly the most complex key mapping in any game I've played  It's aight
4475	1	a	One of the only game where i spent more time on the graphic settings for optimal 60fps and training in the tutorial than actually playing the game. Aside that the control are smoother than arma 2 and feels more optimized but the content is still lacking. It become a great game if one get invested in it, otherwise pass your way if you expect playing it like a regular FPS with WASD and left click, you'll become a machinist on your keyboard.
338	1	a	The best mil simulation so far !
4192	0	a	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! For a $60 game, this is one of the buggiest games I have ever played. I'm talking about game breaking bugs too. The recent stamina update has completely ruined this game. You walk 2 feet and you're breathing harder than you would after finishing a 5 hour fap session, its horrendously stupid. It makes it impossible to aim down sights. DO NOT BUY ARMA 3
5006	1	a	10/10 they fixed (for the most part) the optimization issues. I am now able to play at a stable FPS.
3540	1	a	Best game ive ever played tbh
1126	1	a	I played the game at free weekend and i find it very good but even more promising. The graphics are breathtaking while the gameplay, in my opinion, can imrove a bit. I loved the greek setting, it reminds me of my vacations. The bad thing is that the free weekend is over and now I can't afford to buy the full game...Anyone offering it as a gift? :)
4822	1	a	GET IT
421	1	a	Was playing some Battle Royale, Going along my way, when I met a guy with an ATV he was nice enough to give me a ride, 4 guys popped out of nowhere and chunked grenades at us! we were trying to stop sence they were in front of us... so we were pretty much going 3mph, so i hit EJECT, trying to get away because niether of us had any weapons..... I then was flung over a building and got stuck in a tree, still alive then got blown into oblivion from a Frag grenade   11/10 Would get flung into a tree again
1264	1	a	played it a bit its good.
4821	1	a	Like its predecessors, ArmA 3 succeeds at supplying a realistic, entertaining, and accurate game experience that provides great scenery, new weapons and units, a community-based scenerio workshop, and a game that can be played professionally with a developed community or leisurely on a public server.
1174	0	a	The â¥â¥â¥â¥ing DLC Is Too Damn Expensive
257	1	a	Its ok
2494	1	a	A really great and realistic game but do NOT buy this game if you are not patient because you will have to wait alot of time for a enemy to shoot or to get a chopper, car etc. sometimes.
396	1	a	I went into battle wearing underwear and wielding nothing but a pistol with 200 rounds of ammo and 9 explosive charges 10/10
2795	1	a	I have to say I don't know how play this if I haven't a team .so I think if u want a good game time you must have a team together .
5135	0	a	DO NOT BUY IF YOU PLAY ON YOUR OWN!!!  This is a fantstic game. Lots of things to try but it must be done with friends who can revive you. Otherwise you will fall victim to little boys with snipers overlooking helicopter shops, gun shops etc taking either you out or the helicoper engine immediately as it spawns.  To summarise: Game = Great. Player Base = People who were bullied at school and / or got socks for christmas
4970	1	a	this is the game i got a pc for and im so glad i did.it looks amazing and.there are a lot of buttons to get use to but u can just use basic buttons to get started and learn on the fly.the battle royal mod is worth the price alone.cant say enuff good about this game.get it 
3997	1	a	A yo dude dis is te â¥â¥â¥â¥ if yo want to shoot sum of dose cops niqqua. DAMN DIS â¥â¥â¥â¥ IS LIKE DEtroit LIKE BAGHDAD NIQQUA GOOAAD DAAYM
4930	0	a	More complicated than an instruction book from Ikea.
1941	1	a	If you like realistic shooter you have founded the right game
5192	0	a	very bad optimization not recommanded
119	1	a	the clouds look good
1571	1	a	played - battle royale, altis life, arma 3 life, KOTH, campaign, wasteland, exile, breaking point. would reccomend a lot if you think your PC can run it.  there is a couple problems that cant really be fixed easily in my opinion but i'd say but overall a pretty solid game.
892	1	a	my hours say it all lol... i spend way to much time on that game. it is awesome ..wish i was better with the gun to get the full exp. it is well worth the money :)
3750	1	a	I do recommend this game, but there is something that you need to know about this game.... This game is not the most optimized game out there, your PC might struggle like hell. You can enjoy this game if your PC specs meet the requirement, even so you might face FPS drop during gameplay (explosion, etc.). This game is CPU intensive, if you experience FPS drop, there's a chance it is caused by your CPU (unless you set the graphics all the way to high then your GPU might be the case too).  This is a military simulation game, if you like games like Call of Duty (and used to it), you might not like this game however if you want to try something new then this game is worth a shot. This game has limited HUD, there is no minimap and if somebody is shooting, you will not be given a hint and you will need to find the source yourself. You will be given a compass to help you to locate yourself, and to give other people hints about the location of the enemy. Every single bullet counts, I mean 1-3 shots can kill somebody, do not spray and pray. You will not be given a hint about your location, so you need to be observant and check your surrounding.  One big problem about this game is.... There is no melee so you can't kill other players with a knife, it can be a huge turn off for some people (I am one of those people), nevertheless it is less likely that you will use melee in the game, it is most likely a gunfight.  If you want a shooter game and want to spice things up then Arma 3 could be the game for you, if you are still unsure then you can check some YouTube videos and see it for yourself. This game is hard, the control buttons are many (I highly recommend newcomers to go to the tutorial first) before going into the campaign or multiplayer.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- My PC specs can be seen in my profile, just to let you know how well this game run at least in this setup. I can play this game in Ultra settings.
118	1	a	This game is a very great Game !  It's definitly worth the money (but don't buy it for full price)   Pros:
365	1	a	...a wonderful game, to loose yourself in it for hours. It has a kinda big learning curve, but its acctually worth going threw it.  I enjoy myself in the Multiplayer a lot and love the challange of battleing other gamers while doing Missions. Addons such as the TFR, JSRS or the Nato-Speznas weapons make it to a real nice Warfare simulation. It requires a good CPU and GPU, but all in all its a nice game to play and i am happy i purchased it ;)
2112	1	a	I got to say, I'm just the under 1k hours on this game, and i have to tell u this game is great, many many hours spent having fun, it's tough at the beginning but u get better, only downside to this game is that it is addicting
4952	0	a	This is a waste of money. You'd think it would be good, but it isn't. It has all the pieces of a good game, but lacks emotion, even for a sandbox.
3025	1	a	The best military sim on the market, bar none.
4785	1	a	Like Skyrim with guns.
1129	1	a	This game is one of the most polished bohiema interactive games  i will write this review in catgorieys i hope you agree with me  Gameplay - SinglePlayer 3 - 5   The singleplayer is ok the campaign was not as good as the others and that is why i give it a 3 out of a 5 as i would not  replay this campaign   Content - Vanilla 2 - 5   in arma 3 Vanilla the content is pritty much recycled for examples there are like 10 varients of a MX rifle and not many default vechicles and thats why i would rate Content for the Vanilla 2 out of 5  Content - Add-ons 5-5   The main thing about arma is that the DLC is made by mostly the communtiy aka Free - Addons you can get addons that add more weapons, more Vehicles, More Infentry and MUCH MORE!!!! making the addons for content a perfect 5   Vehicles - Handling and Models 4-5   The Vehicle play in arma aka handling is not really that good but the Models are amazing and have had alot of hard work put in them making this catgory a 4   Mission Editor - aka the editor that allows people to make a misson 5 - 5  The Mission editor is spectacular in arma 3 and should allway be used want to make a halo dive misson you can make it want to make a infiltration mission you can do it want to make a stealth misson you can do it making a perfect 5  Overall 9 - 10   Arma 3 is deffintly worth a buy i would recomend it if you are a hardcore fan of arma 2 the addons add huge amounts of replability i hope you get this game and enjoy it the Multiplayer gets a 5-5 since its so amazing i would reccomed this game to anyone who is a fan of Arma games
4340	1	a	One of the best games i ever played! The optimization is really bad, but still enjoyable
2446	1	a	it's good game  with friends only
3792	1	a	Do not get this game if you wish to have a normal life.  10/10 would waste life again.
2928	1	a	It's a game that opens a gateway to mods that are better than the game.

4503	1	a	This game is amazing I think everybody should have it king of the hill is my favorite game on you should also try to get modded things like Arma 3 life maybe Takistan overall it's a really good game I'd recommend it to anybody
3956	1	a	Updated review: I have been exploring more features of Arma 3 and I love it!   I have been playing a bit of the standard Arma 3 features which are fun, but the sheer number of mods and workshop missions is unreal! This game is so flexible.  My most favourite mods and missions I have been playing are:  Altis life: think along the lines of GTA, but everyone ever where is a real player, the police, military, bandits, civilians, criminals, everyone. It is a very immersive mission where you do what you want, whenever you want. Earn money through doing legal jobs, or become a criminal and traffic drugs, rob banks, rob other players, do whatever you want to survive, but beware your actions could get you on the police wanted list. Buy food, weapons, vehicles, licenses and so much more, it is a great experience when your on an active server.  Escape Altis: an online coop game which can also be played single player, your goal to escape the huge island of altis. You will encounter AI enemy`s in all kinds of locations, choose how you get through, stealthy? Or guns blazing? Do it your way! This mission is very challenging and lots of fun, best with mates!  Breaking Point: Think Dayz but on a bigger map, less glitches and now a choice of 5 factions to choose from. Each with their own perks, rules (or none depending which you choose), and appearance. Breaking point provides 5 maps, Altis, Stratis, Thirsk summer and Thirsk winter.  The thirsk maps are PvP orientated with survival thrown in for good measure.  Stratis is bigger than than Thirsk maps with a bigger focus on survival against zombies and other players. Altis is just huge!  While breaking point is still in its infancy, the dev team is working really hard at it and adding new features and maps frequently. Vehicles in this mod are fairly rare, so expect work to be done finding them, you will also have to fix them up to get them working to.  I love the Arma 3 engine, it is so flexible and allows for so many different ways to play, it just never gets dull.  I highly recommend it!
161	1	a	Arma 3 is one of those games where you feel aslthough you yourself have been transferred onto the battlefield. The gameplay, especially when paired with a friend is to die for and the extensive DlC's and community content mean that you will be able to squeeze all your moneys worth out of this game. Where it's demanding on your hardware it makes up for this with it's at times almost photorealistic graphics. One spot that could use work in my opinion is the weapon handling, clunky and hard to manage at times the gunplay dosen't always feel as realistic as other games I have played. All in all though I am absolutely in Awe of this game as I was with its predecessors. Very good game that I would definately recommend.
4909	1	a	Great game! Need a very good rig to run with decent fps online though. Servers stack memory causing FPS issues in multiplayer sometimes. But this game is another Arma classic and is absolutley gorgeous.
458	1	a	Aswesome game , best war simulation ever , it is worth every cent .
4040	1	a	Awesome game, quality, top preformance. More than 500 mods great and realistic physics, best combat simulator. Awesome game ! I recommend it 100%
4049	1	a	I think ArmA 3 one of the most dangerous game to review in whole ocean of the Steam Games. Because of its style, many people don't like this game at all and compare it with the other games like BF3, CoD series. However it is another story. First of all it is a military simulation which offers you to  realism . I have been playing ArmA series for about 100 hours now and I haven't thought leave it yet.  If you  like  slow developed action, the tactical thinking rather than just fire everywhere and have couple of friends to cooperate this game will be in your dreams when you shut it down and sleep. The mission making system, modding support and huge map is definetely make this game better than many of the First Person Games,  in my opinion . 
1489	1	a	Amazing, best shooter I have ever played.
1195	1	a	Best $60 I have spent on a game. There is just so much you can do with arma right out of the package - King of the Hill, Altis Life, Wasteland etc. Then there are many options being created by community members in the form of modifications; guns, vehicles, gamemodes. If you're on the fence i suggest you just buy it. There really is a community for just about everyone in Arma.
4853	1	a	best game ive played in a while , needs some optimization but its good
1131	1	a	a little hard to get use to and takes alot of skill, but is the game of which I have spent the most amount of time on and never get bored of due to the completely dynamic multiplayer and community made missions and mods. This game is truly a hell of an experiance and I personally recommend it especially to persons who may be either interested or are already in the millitary
739	1	a	What an awesome game !
3673	1	a	ArmA 3 is a sandbox military game, which excels in a number of ways. The way the game encourages community-play and user modification is unprecedented. I'll briefly summarize a couple pros and cons.  PROS:   Infinitely customizable. With the in-built editor and SQF scripting language, you can make any scenario you can think of.   Thriving modding community. With small mods that change minor gameplay aspects to complete overhauls like CUP and RHS, there is an incredible amount of community built content for you to enjoy.   Variety of scenarios. If you want to be a lone wolf in a zombie apocolypse, or just a standard rifleman in a huge coordinated operation, there are scenarios and groups for you.   CONS:   Almost requires DLC. You can play the game purely vanilla, but most servers and communites you find will require at least Apex, if not everything else.   Steep learning curve. Being a game with incredible movement controls, these controls all require keybinds that need to be learned, on top of potentially learning to fly planes and helicopters, this could take a while.   In summary, Arma 3 can cost a bit and take a large amount of hard drive space, but is extremely rewarding to learn and find a group of people to play with.
4872	1	a	A very good game.Thx Bohemia
5263	0	a	Really wished i could recommend this but i can't. I've been on the ArmA train since Operation Flashpoints release and while ArmA II had a few things to wish for, ArmA 3 feels like a neverending Open Beta. The AI is godawfully dumb, unable to perform the simplest tasks without messing entirely up, the map itself is about as bland and boring as it can get, the 2035 theme is new but equally useless since most weapons and the entire scenario feel randomly thrown together with a few real life references.  Long story short, awful optimization, looks awful, feels bad, leaves a LOT to wish for, and it feels like the Community that once made Flashpoint the amazing thing it was has grown tired. Modding teams vanished with noone to replace them, most missions are coop with no care for atmospheric SP missions as it was with OFP... all in all it is far more of a techdemo than an actual game.
5283	1	a	I love how there is so many other gamemodes to play my favorite to play is Atlis life its just so much fun and i cant see any problem with this game
684	1	a	Love this game. Love it how it is set and everything!
917	1	a	This game is worth every penny, a bang for your buck.  Lots of mods, a huge player base.  It does have a high learning curve, but once you master it, you will have a great war simulator.
5202	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game
2712	1	a	10/10 my favorite game ever walked down the street in rpg some guy knocked me out robbed me and then cut out my kidney then out of no where he just shot me in the head and the tdm/ctf/etc games are fun
3944	1	a	love this game i keep spending all my hours on it
998	1	a	Such graphics Much fun Many guns Can your computer run?
4205	0	a	Performance sucks, gameplay is ok if you can find it, overall it sucks. Running simulator at its best.
4987	0	a	Having spent about 1,000 hours on Arma2/OA (between D2D/Disk Version/Steam) and 70 hours in Arma 3, it's no contest in anything but graphics. Arma2/OA is much better in terms of realism. The bullet sponge AI in Arma3 (sorry body armor doesn't let you just keep trucking like it was a bee sting) just kill any immersion whatsoever along with the ridiculous fantasy Iranian units. Also simple things like the 'flying' drop down when placing units are gone in the new editor for no apparent reason.  Overall Arma 3 does look a lot better, but still runs pretty poorly regardless of high end hardware (i7 960@4.1Ghz+STRIX R9 390X/ 3930K@4.2Ghz+STRIX GTX 1060/ i7 4770K@4.3Ghz+780Ti MATRIX SLI (previously 290X MATRIX CF and 390X STRIX CF) / i7 6700@stock+GTX 1070FE / i7 5930K@4.5Ghz+STRIX 980Ti SLI (previously 780Ti MATRIX SLI).   Rather than wasting time on a dubious futuristic setting it would have been far better for the developers to focus on quashing performance issues and providing a believable simulation with realistic damage based on impact point+round+angle. Also AI is still very dumb and STILL unable to haul @$$ with a sense of urgency.   I see Arma 3 as a downhill slide for the series, being far more casual than previous iterations in terms of attempted realism compounded by unwillingness to expand the core mechanics for realism that had been laid down since OPFP. In a way it's more like the Battlefield version of the series.  Also on the campaigns; they are straight up trash. Resistance and Red Hammer have not been bested to date, although the Arma 2 campaign was pretty fun. Arma 3 is just a slog of monotony; APEX is a waste of money.
2478	1	a	Definitely worth the $60. Been playing it ever sense I bought it. 10/10 would buy again.
2135	1	a	been playing the game for a little bit, its ok
2092	1	a	Hmm, where do I begin with this review?  Well, first of all, I am a veteran to this series and I have been playing ArmA for the past 6 years. This is a game that will always keep you interested with the powerful Eden Editor, Zeus, various multiplayer gamemodes and the brilliant singleplayer campaigns.  For the beginners, this is a game that you need to keep on playing to develop your skills, you will not start off as a hero or have the ability to 'run and gun.' This is a military combat simulator sandbox and if you get shot, chances are you will die but if you don't, your abilities will be hindered and become combat ineffective. Best way to learn how to play the game is to go into the editor and make your own little scenario to practise or use one of the many scenarios made by the developers. For multiplayer, there are many different types of gamemodes and missions available across hundreds if not thousands of servers around the globe but if you want a true immersive experience, you would need to join a unit or community that plays with operations, teamwork, coordination and more, including mods to get the best experience.  Mods; man, that's a huge part of the ArmA community. There is a massive community on the BiForums and Steam Workshop dedicated to modifications to enhance your ArmA experience. Some of the big ones like Community Upgrade Project (CUP) has a variety of weapons, vehicles and terrains ported from previous games to ArmA 3. Red Hammer Studios (RHS) has United States Armed Forces (USAF) which includes a large array of US units, weapons, ground vehicles and aircraft. There are so many mods that this game has that I could write a paper to list not even half of them.  The official DLC's for this game are quality content, the Marksman DLC and the Helicopter DLC are a little on the expensive side of things for the amount of content you get but APEX is the best DLC for this game, an entirely new map, lots of new weapons, vehicles, units and more. However I would still suggest you wait until this game and its DLC's go on sale before purchasing it, better 'bang for your buck.'
3643	1	a	Arma 3 is the best game that ive ever played its a amazing experince that suits every game mode
4216	0	a	NOT an AMD friendly engine!!   I have played this game since it first showed up on early access. I also had an Intel setup most of the time (2600, 3770K, and 4770K). It ran flawless with those CPU's (average FPS of about 70-80). I had to make a downgrade a few months back, and i went to a 6800K from AMD. Using the same GFX card, the CPU has become UNUSABLE for this game. Average FPS of about 17, and even lower in bigger towns. I know im not the only one, and i do know that this engine LOVES hyper threading. But you would think by now, it would have some sort of optimization of the AMD side of things.
2940	1	a	Great game, I recommend the DLC to enhance gameplay and make it more immersive. I would prefer the DLC to be free and part of the game but sadly Bethesda needs $$$ and that's the best way to get it. I'm not mad at all about buying this game and all the DLC. The developers still work on updates to the main game to add new features for better gameplay and have done an excellent job. The new APEX DLC is a must-buy because it shows the true beauty of the Arma game engine on Tanoa. 10/10
4429	1	a	If you're into self deprevation and hating yourself, than this is the game for you. Every modd for this game looks amazing, and turns out to be completely buggy and unplayable. Cheers.
2995	1	a	This is a 1st/3rd person war simulation engine, not quite a game on its own (yet). Arma III comes with very little content on its own and it is ripe with missing features and bugs, but the guys over at Bohemia Interactive have been dilligent with patches, features, and support (There's an entire website dedicated to live bug tracking and suggestions with feedback from the developers which is incredibly rare). That being said, many users still continually suffer from lag and crashes and the game has very high requirements to run and look nicely.   Despite the missing bugs and features, the game has all the core components of a strong simulation game. The developers have done well on bullet physics and the graphics look really nice on max. On the other hand, the game is very complex and the controls will be difficult to pick up for new players. Your bullets are not lazers that hit your target immediately, you will need to range your target, adjust the sight on your gun to the appropriate distance, and lead them appropriately to have a chance of hitting them. Unless you're under 300m away, then let your inner call of duty player out.   The game's built in content consists of scenarios and the recently added campaign. The scenarios and tutorials are introductions into the various attributes of the game from flying helicopters to assault diving to artillerty strikes. The campaign feels like a bunch of scenarios strung together and adds very little to the game. All things considered, the campaign is bad and you won't want to play or remember it for long.   But you don't buy this game for the single player.  The multiplayer game modes are what put this game head and shoulders above other similar multiplayer games. Players can join a wide variety of different game modes that are downloaded and installed automatically for the player before joining the server. There are only two maps: A large map that bogs down servers with its sheer size and a smaller map that doesn't bog down the servers as much. Just like in Arma 2, there are many guides, tools, and tutorials provided and created by the community in order to produce new and diverse game modes and content. The popular DayZ mod will likely not exist in Arma 3 because of the upcoming standalone installment, but the Wasteland mode offers the same scavenging/survival mechanics sans zombies. There are also deathmatches, missions, and rpg modes to cater to every type of player.   The Call of Duty crowd would probably get bored by the slow pace of the game. The Battlefield 4 crowd will have much more common ground, but might dislike the lack of polish in the game. The Arma 2 crowd will enjoy the game.  My tips for starting to play: In any game mode, in any lobby, in any situation where you're unsure, in any situation where you have no clue what's going on, ask questions. The community is incredibly responsive and helpful. They will know the game better than you and their help will mean the difference between all your shots going right over the enemy's head or right into the enemy's head (Adjust your scope's range with PgUp and PgDown).  You should probably stay out of global voice chat (Use . and , to change your chat channel, stick to the blue team channel if you're not sure where you should be talking).
3691	1	a	This game made me â¥â¥â¥ 5 times in 5 MINUTES!   No Sign Up No â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t No Download   Download NOW for FREE HD PORN Game!  *terribly animated porno GIF here*
3864	1	a	3 years later after release, still feels like it's in beta.
1298	1	a	This game is a lot of fun, with a great set of multiplayer game modes.
4766	1	a	This ame sucks I can't stop playing it
1435	1	a	really nice game
63	1	a	The only game i'll happily play at 5 fps.
1937	1	a	Amazing game, would totally reccomend who have been fans of the Arma series
1632	1	a	+ big variety of mods + new vehicle physics are great + butterfly shadows + massive world to explore with potential for long range engagements + detailed visual presentation + a lot of fun (mods: altis life, a3L, koth, exile, breaking point, wasteland...) + solo/coop missions in workshop (Doomsday,...)  - controls feel clunky - steep learning curve - technical issues - CPU heavy game (low FPS)  Ps: The Fps depends also on the server you are playing on in Multiplayer.
5382	0	a	This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ compared to ARMA2. Gear loadout saving process is â¥â¥â¥â¥ and not working, optimization is â¥â¥â¥â¥, AI is â¥â¥â¥â¥. In other words, it's a downgrade. Keep playing ARMA2 until this game is patched/fixed
3856	1	a	Damn good game. So many mods, so little time.
4661	1	a	Holy, What can I say? Bohemia you did it again, there is never a dull moment with this game, one moment I was walking through a forest with my men, being stealthy (I took my pants off to be super sneaky) and one guy set off a mine, killed 2 of my men, we had to fight a whole squad of the enemys my heart was racing.   Think you have had enough of this game? Your wrong, there is TONS of modders out there creating mods for our entertainment, from zombie killing to diving contests, there is a mod for you.  Don't feel like playing a mod? Go to the steam workshop and find a mission that others made, for you to play!!! All in all 12/10
3717	1	a	Another case of 'download mods for several days then play for several hours, repeat'
522	1	a	power of arma is in modding and community, it is improved a lot since previous titles and BIS will support its development further.   (good side) nice graphics improvement from arma 2, the game has an editor that let you do what you want on a huge map and multiplayer is fun.   (bad side) The campaign is ok, fps drop in towns and the game is hard for beginners and bad vechiles physics.    conclusion   Best military simulation I have ever played, and possible one of the best games.
5296	1	a	Exile mod is the only good thing this game. And also wasteland mod! Don't bother with single player or the official servers.
4662	1	a	Great game for immersion, and Infantry simulator... IF... You can find a good server. Many servers will claim 'realism,' but are just a bunch of 'Call of Duty' players who run and gun. That's not what this game is about. If you can find that server sweet spot however, then you have a very eventful and structured experience. Real squad tactics are welcomed.
4089	1	a	Pretty cool game, definately an upgrade from Arma 2, a lot more content and it is more optimized.
1247	1	a	Whilst still not as refined as it's predecessor Arma 3 offers a host of improvements in it's engine and graphics. The community is growing and you can expect to find a vast array of experiences from the many game-modes on offer:  CTI (Capture the Island) KOTH (King of the Hill) Life Roleplaying Battle Royale Team Deathmatch Zeus COOP Patrol Ops COOP Invade and Annex COOP  To really appreciate this game find a good group of people to play with and it'll probably become the best gaming investment you ever made!
4972	1	a	  wish i could play this game, if anyone wants to help a poor child in africa pls gift me this game
3634	1	a	You know why! Just get it...
3371	1	a	Be advised:  +Extreme realism +Complex squad play +Awesome engine +Mods (Altis Life, Epoch etc.)  -Extreme realism -AI Squad Leaders are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ -Little content inside. Requires third-party content to remain interesting. -Does anyone actually play the game itself?  you will never get closer to an actual war/10
609	1	a	Best ArmA so far es[ecialy physics of the vehicles, as well as its amazing graphics!
3844	1	a	I hate reviews so this is going to be extremely short, but this game deserves a good one more than anything else.  I can not reccomend this game more highly, or reccomend any other game more than it.   It provides you with the most realistic, and highest quality military elements in the video game industry and allows you to do anything you want with them.  Infinity/10
5411	1	a	When it comes to writing a review for this game, I really don't even know what to say. This series has always been a go to for me, basically since the beginning of my PC gaming days, I was playing OFP in 2001. Over the years this series has entertained me longer than any other i've ever played. There is absolutely no competition to ArmA, no game/simulator comes even close to what arma has to offer, or even comes close to the gameplay experience ArmA has. As any ArmA veteran knows, there is some humps you need to tackle to get use to the game. It's not a game a where you can just join a server and play like battlefield or red orchestra. That's not how the game is structured. It's not a game where you can play it natively, it is not designed in a structured gameplay style what-so-ever. This isn't a game where you can play by yourself( Well, you could...). It's hard to explain to the average-gamer what this game is about. It's a platform and if you're playing it without utilizing the very nature of the game is not going to result in the ideal experience you have heard about. You need to have a community of players, small or large, and 3rd party content to form the game into the GAME you want this PLATFORM to be. The average content pack is at least 10gb, but you should expect 20+gb of content. The game is designed to be modified. Arma 3 has no asset content and ArmA 2 is merely a skeleton of a game body. Explaining to the average player that they need to download a special program and install 10s of gigabytes of content is difficult, it sounds like hard work. Your average player doesn't want to 'work' to get the game into a playable state. That's understandable, but that's not what this game is about. It's so versatile for a reason, so groups of people can make the game exactly how they want it. It's really almost too much to explain, all I can say is that if you give this game a chance, and you put in the work for the first time around to set it up, it's amazing. It is absolutely unmatched. Almost every issue you are going to hear about this game comes down to user error. If people are complaining about the AI, and the futuristic content( or the lack of content), that is entirely because they are not using the game to it's potential. If you don't alter the game meant to be altered, you're going to have a bad experience. The same concept can be applied to performance. I'm sure if you've looked up ArmA, you're probably wondering if you can run it. It is true that arma is a heavy game to run, but that usually is not the source of the problem. 90% of the people complaining about lag are running the game on weak computers that just cannot run arma. The game is not considerably unoptimized, it does have some networking issues, but they are hardly the cause of any major performance problem. This is an intensive game, 5 years ago you could not even dream to see what arma is providing. In a couple years, it will be much more easy to run given the bound-to-happen advancements in hardware. It also comes down to the mission maker and the server hoster, if you don't run your servers right, you are going to give your players bad performance. This game does not babysit you, and you should not expect it to. If you know what you are doing, and you have a decent computer, you will run this game with no problem at all. I hope you take the time to try it, and don't blame everything you are uncapable to do on Bohemia. There is very few things I can say that have made an impact on my life that aren't real, maybe 1 other game out of the hundreds that i've played. ArmA is one of those, there is some great, hilarious experiences in ArmA that I think I will remember the rest of my real life. Not many games can do that.
600	0	a	Optimized as a potato.
2423	1	a	The thinking mans shooter. Also hilarious physics glitches AND one of the most active and diverse modding communities out there. If you like shooting things, but dont have the reflexes for CS anymore, get this. Its amazing!
742	1	a	its the best
1568	1	a	very nice game
598	0	a	This could have been a great game, the problem is the developers of the engine are stuck in the 1990Â´s and made an engine that dont take advantage of your GPU. With an i7 2600 and GTX 780 i have between 20-30 FPS, and i have that on absolutely maxed out settings as well as the lowest possible. There is only one reason to even consider this game, and its for the great mod community. But overall, this company does not deserve any of your money.
2152	1	a	So much stuff to do, RP/Battle Royale and what not. Excellent game and supported still by the developers at Bohemia!
504	1	a	-stole cop car -crashed cop car -died  fun game 10/10
3913	1	a	Great looking game. And the MOD's are just awesome. Don't get thoughts behind the DLC's tho..
4005	1	a	this game is only good if you remember the controls, and to remember the controls, you will need a PhD in quantum physics and engineering.
2513	1	a	Gnary &lt;3
3980	1	a	great game:)
4657	1	a	First thing I'm getting once it's 75% off (bless the family sharing and thank you Tora). Pure gem for military sim, with next-gen icing on top.
3155	1	a	oMg so realistic even the grases moves unlike cod lol buy the premium edition for your special skull camo and ac-130 killstreak (Srsly tho it is a good game get if you think your graphics card wont melt on ultra lul)
2599	1	a	An amazing game. Was able to play it free for a weekend. Had so much fun! Anyone who can afford it should get it IMMEDIATELY
3855	1	a	If you like playing games you'll like playing this game.
3369	1	a	Possibly the most realistic military game with extreme replayablility. I don't regret a single cent I spent on this game, worth everything I Yianni is a F_A_G for it and more!
2962	1	a	Not for the kinda person who enjoys intense fast paced action. the game requires skill and practice to be compitent and a strategic quick thinking mind is of utmost importance. install the game on an SSD aswell, when loading textures it laggs more than most games and a good SSD will remove that lag.
4580	0	a	This game was so fun until this new Apex DLC came out and completely ruined the game and play style and the new UI is cancer. I just wanted to play it i opened it then realized it has the Apex DLC and i slowly moved my cursor over to the X in the top right and clicked... RIP Arma 3
4478	1	a	This game is the best Arma game in the entire series it is truly an amazing game. The graphics are suprisingly good and the gameplay is very fun especially if you like realisic war games that takes teamwork and strategy to stay alive. But I would not recomend this game to the daily Call of Duty fan boy guy, this game is slow paced and takes LOTS of strategy and teamwork, unlike Call of Duty's run and gun and lone wolf type of game. If you are familiar with Arma 2 this is everything you love with better graphics and physics, for example. Arma 2, you shoot a man he stands there for a sec then falls down and dies with no blood affect. Arma 3, you shoot a man he realistically falls (some what rag doll physics) and there is a realistic blood affect. Overall I think the game is great and I give it a 10/10.
4934	1	a	I SUCK AT THIS GAME!
3093	1	a	As soon as I launched this game for the first time I fell in love with it. Arma 3 takes all of the things that Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead had, and improved on it twice over. First off, Altis is gigantic. Stratis is smaller in size, but it's still impressively large. I've played this game for over 70 hours and I've yet to see the entirety of the map. The whole arsenal meaning the clothes, backpacks, weaponry and vehicles are simply amazing. While the controls are a bit simulator-ey it doesn't take very long for you to figure out the controls, and before you know it, you'll know all the necessary controls to play efficiently.   One thing that I do not really care for is the stamina system, mostly because I feel like my character can have a rifle, a pistol and 2 mags for each and after running 200 metres he would be gasping for air on the side of the road.   The developers let you play the dlc as much as you like for free, but you get a big advertisment on your screen once in a while which has from what I've seen messed up a lot of peoples shots. I don't know if they're done with dlc yet or not, but when they are done with it, I hope to see a gold edition or something so I can buy all of the dlc for less.   If you have a pc that can run this game, buy it.
967	1	a	this is a good game it is fun to play but i think the intro with the helicopter is a bit to long for my liking  i would give this game a 4 out of 5
4447	1	a	I would not say this game is worth buying at full price, but I can tell you that it's really fun nonetheless. There are a lot of bugs and it feels more like a retextured and updated Arma 2 but there are plenty of fun scenarios and multiplayer is very good. The game requires a really beefy computer to not run on â¥â¥â¥â¥ graphics so if you have a crappy computer and you don't want to see â¥â¥â¥â¥ graphics, then don't get this game. However, if you're up for an intense milsim, then get this game.  Rate: 8/10
4911	1	a	Perfect game!
5303	1	a	Ground combat. Air combat. Underwater combat. Vehicular combat. THIS GAME HAS A LOT OF COMBATS!   And yeah.. It's not perfect but it's really fun if you find a unit.  11/10
1070	1	a	Amazing Game if you are apart of a mil-sim (160th-SOR) good campaign, great range of mods and Multiplayer servers and game modes.
3576	1	a	Best shooter out there!  KOTH FOR WIN
3873	1	a	Eat â¥â¥â¥â¥
629	1	a	This game is great, coming off from playing a lot of arma 2 this was a great change in this franchise. You can make this game whatever you would like it to be. Always wanted to be a hard-core cop killing drug dealer? You got it! It is a great well made game. r8 8/8 m8 gr8 f8s &amp; b8s
2897	1	a	in this game you know that 20 fps are playable.  10/10 would glitch in stone again.
4510	1	a	The game is pretty open ended, which is a very good thing and gives the oportunity to have a possibly endless spectrum of gameplay experience and oportunities. From the casual gaming fun moments to the hard core full on military sim career , the easy to use moding system (i say easy but needs caution and alot of research) guaranties that the possibilities are endless. personally i came for the full on mil-sim experience and i gotta say, i got all i was expecting and then some.
2410	1	a	this game is just to good
4887	0	a	The last of the 'Arma''s series...  What to say? A great 'technical' game, a really poor overall display.  Not fun: buggy AI, dull mission, difficult controlling of vehicles, not so many vehicles, not so many good (and bug free) mod...  It's Arma 2, with some improvments and better graphic...  Really disappointing.
4927	1	a	Intel 2 Cores 2 Thread = 10 fps 2 Cores 4 Threads = 11 fps 4 Cores 4 Threads = 40 fps 4 Cores 8 Threads = 80 fps 8 Cores 16 Threads = 140 fps AMD 2 Cores 2 Modules = Doesn't Run 2 Cores 4 Modules = 12 fps 4 Cores 4 Modules = 20 fps 4 Cores 8 Modules = 22 fps  Solution to good gaming experience in arma 3. Waste $3,000 on a decent PC.
4614	1	a	Drove 10 minutes to get to the objective, i hit a tree and my ATV broke. Had to run for 20 minutes to the obj. and got immediatly shot. 10/10
1440	1	a	This game isn't comparable to the simple minded Call of Duty, or Battlefield. It's much different, more complicated and dynamic, however that's what makes this game so ridiculously fun to play. The sheer diversity of this game, including mods and custom campaigns from Steam Workshop makes this game replayable for what seems an eternity.   ArmA 3 provides what ArmA 2 has, and even more, with better graphics, gameplay, controls and detail. Don't let the absurd metascore of 74/100 turn you away (Metacritic are idiots who only use 5 minutes of gameplay to rate a game, unless they're paid otherwise. Come at me Metacritic.) This game deserves much better reception than it has.  A solid game for a solid player, ArmA 3 will provide hours upon hours of entertainment for a first person shooter (or an RTS player) who are looking for a game that requires more skill and organisation to play.  Some of the best mods and game modes available for ArmA 3 are;  -Zeus (The official ArmA 3 RTS combat mode) combines an RTS experience from the eyes of a God, to the FPS experience from a player on the ground, adapting to dynamic situations created by the God.  -PLAYERUNKNOWN'S Battle Royale (Effectively the 'Hunger Games' of ArmA) Battle out over a small island, loot military camps and towns for weapons, and battle to the death as the game area gets smaller and smaller, last man standing wins!  -ArmA 3 Wasteland (Sandbox combat) Stockpile weapons, vehicles and aircraft, build your base with a team and battle between 3 factions with up to 80 players for control over airfields, bases, and objectives to win the game!  -Breaking Point (ArmA 3 DayZ) A zombie survival based off DayZ for the ArmA 3 maps - Stratis and Altis  and many others!  Do I recommend this game? Hell yeah I do.
4274	1	a	10/10 would arma 3 again
1680	1	a	Love this game thanks to this and arma 2 got me in to pc gaming 10/10
1943	1	a	To be fair, ArmA 3 is the best BI game since ArmA 2.  It has so much more to offer, both mods-wise as well as possibilities.  The mission editor is very well thought out compared to ArmA 2's.  Most, if not all of the weapons and vehicles are futuristic enough that as a player, they look and behave realisticly enough to be believable.  A few things that I also feel enhance the gameplay are the RHS unit and faction mod, as well as the ACE3 medical mod and the ACRE Radio mod.  Other than that, having played well over 1,000 hours on this, anyone purchasing this game will find it well worth your money.
1808	1	a	Its gr8 bnter
1531	1	a	Im not one for writing Reviews, but i have to admit, that Arma 3 is one of my Favourites thus far, As with any Modern Day FPS game, this has alot of differences, It has Realism, The Ai respond to your actions, Be it through Stealth or wrecklessness ((Apologies for my spelling)) You have to work as a Team on countless objectives, This game is a Must for all those FPS Simulation Nerds who long for this sort of thing, It is also best played with friends, But the one drawback to which i find annoying every now and then, Is the Frame drops in certain Areas, Much like Arma 2's Chernarus Map ((which i played 05 Superpowers with friends religiously)) Does render Gameplay a little, But overall, A definate worthwhile game to play, Reccommended Throughout.  10/10 Will Die and Die again XD
1031	1	a	This game amounts to about a half a pile.
4706	1	a	Awesome ***** Have only played a few minutes of the single player, NPC asked me to shoot the medic WTF ? But 50+ hours of Altis life (mod) has me hooked, not since the early GTA games have I experienced the wonder of an enormous game world.  Add the pvp elements from dayz and a thriving community, its the best thing going.  
5114	0	a	65/100  Pro's Very good scale, and detail in the world allows you to see things miles away.  A large selection of well modeled weapons, gear, vehicles.  Multiplayer if done right, can be epic and quite a bit of fun. These servers are extremely hard to find though.  Cons Very poor AI - I'm talking drop dead liberal half baked hippie 2nd grade education type of stupid.  NO CONTENT - took almost 2 months just to release a few single player missions No Multiplayer Support - no real official missions or servers to help keep the population high.  BUGS BUGS BUGS Performance issues Missing a lot of must have vehicles and aircraft that would really add to the simulation.  I would NOT recommend buying this game until about a year of patches and they complete the game. It is UNFINISHED as of right now.
4234	1	a	Best game in the world, beautiful graphics...
1575	1	a	Love this damn game! Too many hours, can't wait for more updates!
990	1	a	better than cod lol
2056	1	a	Loud  paul also found this gr8 7/7
163	1	a	So real I thought I was going to die irl.
1454	1	a	This game is extremly good. I recomend it to anyone that like roleplaying games.
4962	1	a	played it a bit... it's not bad
4666	1	a	Great millitary simulator game would recomend for people who like to feel like there in the action 
2993	1	a	Fantastic, the level editor is mostly what I do. But still. Mods are great, community is nice, everything is spot on. I also hooked up a flight stick and throttle and did tons of dogfights. It feels great. Specs are a little bit demanding too.
4518	1	a	Do you enjoy constant CTD? Get this. It's all it does. Get a good desktop wallpaper, because you're going to be seeing it alot.
525	1	a	10/10 would buy again
2947	1	a	Best war game out there
2698	1	a	Arma is a is an amazing game the multiplayer is filled with fun and outstanding and unlimited options. On the other hand the story is not as great as expected but still the multiplayer defently devilers. I rate this gate 5 out of 5 stars due to the comnplex and outstanding multiplayer.
1508	1	a	High quality stuffs.
3624	1	a	50 hours of crawling though a forest only to get mowed down by a well placed machine gun
114	1	a	This game.....This GAME.  Where do I start, I love the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of this game, been trying to achieve MLG at BI's series for a long time now. I've played the Arma series since I was rekkin kids on A2 from 600 on Utes with my Ruski tool, holding a base right in the middle for a few hours every day. It's a beautiful and engaging experience, that leaves you on the edge of your seat, sometimes wishing you were holding your Grandma's face to squeeze tight (till she dies)... Tactical decisions are important, using the terrain and engaging with the movement structure of your enemies is a thrilling experience, adrenaline pulses as bullets and rockets fly closeby. You will never have to remember parts of maps (minute detail), as the maps on this are so big that it allows you to use your brain, instead of arena shooters which don't challenge the psyche.   Graphics - The original Arma 3 engine includes DX11 integration and standardised PhysX interactions, due to a new update recently the game has come to include Volumetric Lighting (big +), Upgraded textures (more vibrant), Water Refraction and a host of other improvements (60+ bug fixes - glaring bugs such as the offsight RPG Alamut Optic). The graphics second Terrain to Item models, however new improvements in the recent update have subsided these issues, Gear is of a signicantly high polycount as well as Vehicles.   ISSUES: Now I'm sure most of us have had a bad experience of Arma FPS lag. And for a long time now, BI has been using the BS excuse 'It's mods.'   Although partly true, that is actually a lie. The way Arma simulates enemies, its peer to peer network structure, animation timers and no multi-threading support are the real reasons behind the terrible frames of Arma 3.  This. Needs. To. Stop.  Although too late for an A3 release, A4 must leave these issues behind.  Gameplay - Arma 3 can be a deeply tactical and engaging game. Many complex systems entwine with each other to create as much of a realistic experience as possible, for example:  - 27 Hit boxes on overall model (from head to toe) - Multiple ammo types (ballistics, AP, EPR, special purpose ((need mods for some))  - Multiple types of vests (explosive resistant, harnesses, body armour, fba) - Multiple attachments (flashlights, scopes, silencers, laserlights) - Unique damage system that many call BS but is actually indepth af for example: Armour actually takes stress under duress, which creates a deeper and more realistic feel to armour. - Your gun can deflect bullets - Bullet penetration  Different types of team play are offered in Arma 3. From 2 - 80ppl, if you wish to be in a large group, there is one out there for you. Expanded group finding features such as the Squad pages and things such as Side chat to hook up with like minded people. There are several clans of varying sizes such as mine, however there are some humungous clans for the more mil sim oriented. Now here's the real thing that makes this stand out from other shooters, I think this is a big thing: anyone can be good at this game. All it takes is knowledge and sensibility when dealing with the sort of situations Arma 3 can spawn. Such as:  - Attacking a base of 14 people by yourself, watching as a chopper crash lands into the base, explosions and debris everywhere! Bodies and people flying to and fro.. - Singing Beyonce down your mic to someone before running out and blasting their head off - Your first RPG heli kill - Your first 9.3 heli kill - Your first 7.62 heli kill - Your first 5.56 heli kil- you get the idea! - One 7.62 to get a double kill on a moving vehicle - Lagging - Dying by rocks - Lagging - Dying by terrain glitches -Lagging  Everything from Capture the Flag to Zombie mods. A favourite of mine is Sa-Matra WS, a very good mod indeed! The varying game modes and the sandbox aspect of Arma 3 really engages the community and attracts newcomers! This game can be completely different dependent on which mod you play. However many of these can easily corrupt which leaves some users unable to resolve issues.   GLARING ISSUE: Horrendous desync issues have plagued Arma 3 since its inception, these have prevented any serious types of eSports leagues. This is a detrimental experience to gameplay, and you will run into it constantly you will get killed by lag constantly and if you are okay with this buy the game, if not DO NOT BUY THIS GAME EVER. (Wait till Arma 4)   Ergonomics - UI in Arma 3 has never been a problem with Bohemia taking a down-to-earth approach to UI design, clearcut menu's, expanded Map features such as markers, topography etc.   Mod support has been vastly expanded with a server browser that is noob friendly, a launcher that highlights and patches missing files and full Steam Workshop support. This is a 10/10.   Finally let me just sum up the experience you will get from this game. If you're looking for sophisticated group play, come to Arma, you'll find a group of weary game travellers such as yourself, who know there â¥â¥â¥â¥ and can provide you with some irreplicable entertainment. Beware of lag and FPS issues, these are the two things hold this game back from a 9/10 or 10/10. It is my favourite game but it is still very imperfect.   Final Verdict: 8/10  
4808	1	a	its good. stop being a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and play arma.  since there's some whiny baby down int he contents  imagine all the things Chris Roberts' said about Star Citizen being able to be any game you want it to be  then make that the truth  that's arma 3.
4537	1	a	What can I say about ARMA.... Well I've logged well over 200+ hours on the game , mainly on CTI. But none the less the game is a masterpeice. I don't mean that it's perfect (because it is far from it). But you will find something here most FPS games will neglect or even bother to look into. REALISTIC WARFARE is the game and Dan is my name. But seriously you will not find another FPS besides BF4 that will entice you so. When you play online and you kill someone from a mile away with a very powerful sniper rifle, I DARE YOU not to feel a bit giddy about it. There is something magical about this games that appeals to me above all other FPS games. When you are in a fire fight you have that feeling of being on the edge of your seat whilst your heart pumps away at the thought of respawning or even when just playing side by side with your mates and helping each other out to defeat an enemy. I have never regretted buying this game and never will! Happy hunting -DH
2563	1	a	Got this game, installed a mod didnt work loaded the campain and got killed by a pterodactyl 9/11 IGN Like down's syndrome sheep on heroin.
3255	1	a	Great game! if you can afford it, BUY IT!!!!!!!!!
3281	1	a	Great Game.So realistic!
4111	0	a	In reality, this is a pretty bad game, rife with glitches and problems. The only saving graces that managed to make this popular were the mods and the fact that there was really no game like this. Until Squad, anyways.
2201	1	a	Beautiful. Still the best game.
2728	1	a	I am very, very conflicted while writing this review. I really loved playing Arma 3. I've had some good times and made some good memmories. And I still havn't even fully explored all the mods that are available! But like I said, I'm conflicted. And here's why.   -No Real Solo Play Online   If you plan on playing alone, prepare to not have fun. Unless you're a gaming golden god with the reaction speed of a gerbil on speed, and the skills of a pro, you're going to be â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off a lot. Especially in specific mods that pit you against other players (Wasteland etc.), you will get angry. Playing mods like this you really shouldn't be someone who gets attached to anything, and is basically entertained by anything that goes beyond finding things go 'boom' interresting. If you want to spend quality time, find a MilSim group. But you'll have to spend a good amount of time on ArmA 3 figuring things out, and also trying to actually get INTO a MilSim group.   -The Single Player Campaign   While I found it fairly entertaining, certain points get tedious and annoying. Especially since the AI have special eyes that can see you from 2KM away as if you were 2M away. But all in all; it's a decent campaign to go through once. (quite lengthy too with about 5 or 6 hours on average.)  I don't know if it can be counted as SP, but the Eden editor can be really fun to play around in! Getting actual things done, and making a working MP map is a huge challenge though. It will take many, many hours to get a MP map working and onto the steam workshop!   -The Community   Ehm, how do I put this... The community is... different. While it has the internet classics such as rage kids and memelords, it contains a more rare breed of internet personality; the elitist. Don't be fooled by people saying that the community is mature, because of it's learning curve and MilSim niche-ness. Personally, I find the elitism to be the most annoying part about Arma 3. The players who find the need to rub in their kills. The players who have the humility of a peacock. Which also brings me to the last group of people I'll talk about; the die-hards. We all know them. People who have 2000 hours logged in Arma 3 and eat, breathe and probably excrete Arma. While I don't really have anything against them (They're better then me. Oh well.) but it does get frustrating when you have people that are making their tea and at the same time headshot you from 3KM distance.    Ratings    + Delivers a MilSim game + A decent amount of equipment variety. + Loads and loads of good mods. + Group fun! ;) + The game is pretty stable in my experience. (Bug wise)  +/- Community can sometimes be frustrating. +/- The game itself can get quite frustrating. (unless like I mentioned, you're MLG pro JesusFPS.) +/- Steep learning curve to not-scrubness.  - Requires a lot of time to actually get into the more MilSim multiplayer parts.    Summary    Pretty gud gam. Buy.
1159	1	a	I've only played Breaking Point. But that mod alone is worth the price of the game.  I'm sure games before it like day z had the looting system and the loss of all items once killed. But since those games seemed broken or full of toxic players I never got into them.   You can either choose to move methodically to try and survive and keep your hours of work. Or just run and gun and enjoy your 15 minutes of life.  There's nothing like laying on a roof for 3 hours only to kill 2 people. Sorry, guys. It's you or me.  The only downside I've found in my 20 or so hours is how broken the melee system is. Also the lack of zombies. There's like 3 zombies per town.
2426	1	a	I Love this game.
4556	1	a	i dont even own this game XD
2635	1	a	great game and would recomend

1052	1	a	A very realistic military game.... The life mods are fun too...
1444	1	a	This is a game in which your each step you need to think about every moment of this game just etched in my memory.

2521	1	a	it does not have the best graphics, and its a bit clunky. BUT it is great fun. i strongly recommend the battle royale mod by playerunknown
861	1	a	I really enjoy this game. This game is different to other wargames. You can make your own missions, the graphics are epic and the maps are 200KM big! You can play alone or with friends. Either way you will enjoy this game. I suggest this game to anyone who is wanting good gameplay and epic battles.
5130	0	a	Worst controls in a game ever... Really want to like this game, but it's hard to enjoy without spending hours learning their painfully unintuitive controls
4227	1	a	I recommend this game, to all the FPS/SIM players!
1256	1	a	Diz gime is bes gam eber cuz it haz grapix and if you pres v button you dance. but lots of haxerz i prezed alt f4 and dey haxd my game annd make me quite the game!!
1852	1	a	I'm a Battlefield 4 player, so i'm noobs Download game=&gt;Open game=&gt; Finish training easily so i think this game is to damn easy  1st: Open campaign, meets two enemies, ONLY 2, i have killed 5 enemies in 1 round in battlefield 4 so i run and shoot them like a boss. suddenly, i fall down and 'You Died'!!! WTF, first time i think they shoot to my head :v 2nd: Again, one bullet from enemy kill me again. i start thinking why NPCs are so good :| 3rd: Spend 30 mins to pass first level, in lvl 2 i have to go to survivors place. i go prone very carefully(god damn it takes me 30 mins go prone), and suddenly a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing bullet from an enemy kill me again, i cant see where he is &gt;.&lt; 4th, 5th: 'you died' again and again=&gt; then I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing smash my mouse :&lt; 11/10 would smash my computer right now :v P/S: if you are newbie, i suggested that you should buy one more keyboard, just in case you mad with this game :v P/S2: Best simulator game i have played :v
3101	1	a	After being eaten by some random house walls in battle royale couple of times you realise that this game is better then Call Of Duty.  9/11
759	1	a	One of the best games ive played in a long time graphics are great if on ultra low graphics are still good and game controls and movement is fluent!
3032	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ fire yo
1589	1	a	great game
1845	1	a	Played for 20 minutes, killed 9 guys I think i might become the best ever
5154	0	a	Pros -lots of fun  -two well made maps  -good mod suport -good online play   Cons  - in the two big maps and the manny verations of it i serched and serched and could not find a TURBO MAN doll   final  although it was fun there was no turbo man dolls and for that im out
3021	1	a	Great game, was hesistant at first but have come to love it.  Come play TOP arma!
2595	1	a	Excellent and fun game that gives you a lot of fun and options for the price. However, the engine is rather poor making catching as stable framerate, or even a decent one can be difficult sometimes even with some fairly high end rigs.
1202	1	a	Shooting dudes is all that keeps me sane.
4119	1	a	ArmA.  It's a game.           Cool.
4665	1	a	Loving this game
3202	1	a	its a yes from me
2438	1	a	Very fun game and good mods !
393	1	a	A-Must-Have-Game!
4838	1	a	Great game, if you are interested in having a Dayz like experience I would recommend downloading the Breaking Point mod.
2847	1	a	one word to describe this game 'unreal'. this game is amazing it not only has an incredible story it also has a vast range of mulitplayer gamemodes like; atlis life, invade adn annex, king of the hill, gun game,wasteland,dayz(epoch and such) and many more.  This game also looks incredibly the only down side is that you need a beastly PC to run it and even then if you get 100 fps on high settings in singleplayer for soem reason multiplayer just eats FPS thats the only major problem   The game has very few glitches (of the ones i have found/coem across)  overall the game is a blast and unlike other games whic are just story based and you could only get so many hours out of it this game (like csgo) you can have unlimited amount of hours but its up to you what you send thme doing
2968	1	a	It's Arma, not Call of Duty or Battlefield or Halo or whatever... It's simulation, so no 360quickscope, no gender-related bashing, no 'noobs vs pro' to a certain degree,   Simply one of the best simulations game in existence. It's basically a military simulations, with multiplayers and good gameplay, with multitudes of community mods. With massive content created by community, you buy this game, you could play more than just 1 game. Yeah, wanna play The Sims? Arma 3 have it. Wanna play Tank Battle? Arma 3 have it. Wanna play Ace Combat? Arma 3 have it. Wanna play racing games? Arma 3 have it. Wanna play... oh come on, try them for yourself! I'm not paid to write long review, so I'm gonna leave it here.   Oh, and zombies... Hehe, what's better than playing zombie in Arma themed world? Download a zombie mod, use a script to spawn tank, and have fun! 
4046	1	a	There are no servers in Asia but the game is pretty enjoyable nonetheless.
1875	1	a	Great game
330	1	a	Great game. Nothing beats this in the Military Simulator Genre.
3878	1	a	The Best Game Ever!!!
4600	1	a	I've been playing since release and have expierenced so many great moments with this game. The potential is huge with thousands of missions on the steam workshops and many great mods. The Devs really work hard on the game and have made many great improvements since release like when they improved the gun sounds (MASSIVE improvment). This game will provide hundreds of hours of fun, no moment like the other in the 2 islands the game offers (although a third will be soon released). The only semi negative point I have is the multiplayer. I find the gamemodes that allow for regular combat simulation (not talking about 100% simulation) are pushed down by gamemodes like altis life (a gamemode I love, don't get me wrong, and others like wasteland. The game offers huge customization, vehicles, and weapons like for example static AA launchers, static MG's just as a vague example, all of which aren't used in the popular gamemode. It would be great if it was simpler to find gamemodes such as a good PVP server where you play as a soldier and no 'money' to buy weapons, just a good simulation where both steams are palyer and just fight
4036	1	a	The graphics are great, and there is a lot of stuff in the game from mortars to drones, helicopters and jets, tanks, civillian and millitary transport vehicles etc. It requires a great deal of skill to pilot/use some of these. The multiplayer is really good, and you can play Altis Life RPG, Wasteland, Co-Op, king of the hill and more. 85% of community is great and much more mature compared to other FPS games. The only thing I don't like very much is infantry movement, not sure why though, feels different. Overall it's a great experience, I recommend it.
2220	1	a	Arma 3 is a very fun game overall, and it managed to keep such a mature community of 'navy seals irl' because the mechanics are pretty complex. I got this game a LONG time ago (pre ordered) and at that time I was 14 (lmao). I had no clue what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ a 'grid' was. Now, I still dont know what a grid is. In all seriousness though, it's a very fun game with a amazing community. Hop on a exile, altis life, or king of the hill server to get the full amount, though.
682	1	a	i frickin' love this game &lt;3 if you haven't bought this game yet... shame. I RECOMMEND YOU PICK IT UP ON SALE.
3602	1	a	My favorite game it is so fun and 128h in game
5031	1	a	Arma 3, the continuation of the series by Bohemia. New players will love it, old players will love it. At the end of the day, it is still Arma, and it will still make you frustrated. But when it goes right, it's worth it. Even if it only goes right once.
1122	1	a	Its dam good game very realistic! 9/10
3786	1	a	Despite the whole 'play as a soldier' part to it, there are many servers that offer a new way to play with the use of roleplaying as a cop, a rebel, or even a paramedic and taking the game to a different level
2798	1	a	Only fun for about 20 mins.
4974	1	a	I would recommend this game to CoD players
4950	1	a	-Plays battle royal, Survives hour and a half with good loot, gets in truck, drives into bush, truck stops working, gets out, truck explodes.- 10/10 so realistic.
4480	1	a	Best game ever. No need for explanation. On of the only games created that should be worth more than $60.00
4553	1	a	I like this game when I get bored of Cs
3724	1	a	I dont know what to think about this game didnt play it much but meh i kinda like it.
2851	1	a	I've always looked at it like this...  Call of Duty is for kids. Battlefield is for teens. Squad is for adults. Arma is for veterans with PTSD.  In all seriousness this game has so much to do and play when you add up the RP games, the actual Arma gameplay, and modded gameplay. You will like playing it alone, you will love playing it with a friend, and you will hate playing it with several friends because no matter how much you vet who you're playing with you will always get a â¥â¥â¥â¥ friend who is a team killer. 
2867	1	a	After coming from DayZ Standalone, I was pretty excited to try this out. I first play a co-op mission and meet really cool guys and made a friend. Next day I played battle royale...  Let's just say I might die with my fingers on the keyboard.  Buy it.                                      Why haven't you bought it yet?                                                                                   Seriously? BUY IT.   
404	1	a	its okay i guess.            this game is life
1127	1	a	Great Game
2872	1	a	  Lots of versatility and tons to do, extremely moddable and a lot of fun to play with friends. Overall its a great game for military simulation or just messing around with friends... Maybe role playing? A ton of fun.
1938	1	a	Came for Exile.... Stayed for everything
3336	1	a	Great game in graphics and gameplay aspects. Mods are awesome too. It's a shame that the optimization drives so many players away
4405	1	a	Hard controls 100000000000000/10 real life so good for friends this game is so niceeeeeeeeeeeee ho buy this game is so good
5075	1	a	I love the editor in this game, the only limitation is your imagination. Plus this game offers a lot of mods that from the workshop or on websites. The game looks amazing and the maps are HUGE! I give this game a 9/10. If you like building your own battlefield and having vurtually unlimited customization,then this game is for you.
3082	1	a	Kinda like warcraft 3 no one buys it for the actual game its all about the mods.
1090	1	a	you can kill people without knowing anything about them and you still do it because you're a mother â¥â¥â¥â¥ing American
2914	1	a	hi my battleye dont work plz help me 
5013	0	a	unoptimized game with overpriced dlcs
924	1	a	Very cool game, it has a lot of modes,and they are fun. i recommend to play this games when you are in a group :D.
284	1	a	There is a Soviet joke from early 80s that goes like this:  Moscow, summer morning, Sheremetyevo airport.  A representative of some very successful Japanese tech corporation heads back to his homeland after an official visit to USSR during which he observed the technological feats of Soviet people. Of course, a huge delegation of Party leaders and reporters is present, just like during any other event of this sort. So, as he walks to his plane, he becomes surrounded by reporters and they ask him, 'What have you liked the most about Soviet Union?'. â You have great children, they're so playful, happy and optimistic about their future. â Awesome! - reporters reply - and have you liked anything else? â You have great children. â Yeah, we love our children too, but what about our cars and TVs and fridges and roads and other things? â You have great children - the representative replies - but everything you make with your hands is terribly bad.  So, Arma series has a really great community. An amazing one, really. I'm thoroughly convinced that no other game has a similar one. But everything made by Bohemia Interactive...  Well, it's not exactly  terribly  bad (and at times it's quite good actually) but Arma, in a way, carries the spirit of Soviet Union's industry: a single manufacturer that gets most of its revenue from excellent military products also produces various civilian goods. These goods, however, while being suitable for their purpose, have a mediocre quality, especially compared to the products of Western companies. But it's the only manufacturer in the country and the Iron Curtain is still in place so you don't really have a choice but to recommend these products to your family and friends.  You really like that Mercedes-Benz W123? Well, too bad, here's a ticket for UAZ-496, comrade.   You're #47,254,875 in the queue.  
4736	1	a	Great Game

3746	1	a	When you're not getting killed by a door or suffering from 10 FPS on your Â£3000 Ultra-Advanced Gaming PC, this game offers a lot of fun through semi-realistic combat and a wide range of game modes.   Multiplayer is what makes the game. Offline game modes are mainly used for practice as the campaign is pretty basic in story and character detail. However, it's hard to get bored of everything that multiplayer has to offer; Altis Life RPG, Wasteland, Exile, Invade &amp; Annex, you name it.   The gameplay mechanics are the worst part of the game. You really can die by opening a bloody door, albeit rare. Not to mention the driving physics. It can be very tough to drive using just W, A, S and D. Even crashing into a rock that appears as though it just 'Came outta nowhere!' at 5MPH can do severe damage to your car and health. The game's packed with glitches.   Aside from the occasional buggy annoyance, if you're looking for a war simulator that allows a range of unique experiences, ARMA 3 is probably your best bet.
3580	1	a	This game will stand the test of time.
3989	1	a	this game brout me 2 tear first time i play.... wow...!....wat a xpereance.  truly beutifull game play  12\10/7
1047	1	a	  this game its awesome with friends
187	1	a	I'm a huge fan of the series (since the good old operation flashpoint), but now i'm hugely disappointed by what public multiplayer has already become! Arma was a Military Simulator aimed for those who like the genre, 90% of public servers today are RPG. For me Altis Life is the plague of ArmA... There needs to be a forced filter to remove them from the server browser. To get that real 'Arma' experiance nowadays you need to play with friends or join a group/clan... No way to get the real Arma experience on public servers. (Sorry for my poor English)
5232	0	a	If your looking for a Good Mil Sim game then I suggest sticking with Arma2..Arma3 has seemed to have turned into a Role Playing game much like world of warcraft...mil sim servers are few and far between altis life dayz and the other role play aspects of arma3 have destroyed what the Arma series was meant to be..but I suppose BI needs to appeal to the masses. Its a well executed game..needs some tweaking but I am sure BI will update just as they did in Arma 2..just dont expect too much in the way of mil sim for what your going to pay for arma 3. Would I recommend this game? Depends..for someone who likes to role play like dayz and life games sure..but for anyone expecting what Arma 2 was..dont bother.
960	1	a	This game is not for the console kids that play COD all day. This is a difficult but fun game. If you look at the negative reviews on it the reviewers have 300 to 700+ hours in this game... thats not the amount of hours you put in this game if you dont like it.... I dont get it.. Anyways. If you choose to buy this game get VAC. It will save your life. The community behind this game is huge and there is always new player created missions and content available. Theres also breaking point mod for arma 3. Basically Dayz for Arma 3. Which I think is better than SA. The guys saying they get low fps... one saying he gets 10 frames?? Its a demanding game... play it on something besides the laptop you bought at Wal-Mart... Bohemia labels it a military sim... thats what it is. It's most def not a run and shoot.
5412	1	a	Great game, The campaign is supprisingly epic ( i don't like campaigns that much ) Battle Royale mod is just amazing to play :3
4715	1	a	So fresh, so clean!
1236	1	a	Scrubland running simulator 2014 is the most realistic scrubland running simulator on the market today. There are two whole islands to explore with varying degrees of grasslands, scrublands, deserts and even pine forests! You can even run through the scrublands as a rabbit or a chicken. Your imagination is truly the limit in this game. 10 despawn seagulls/10.
791	1	a	Having served in the military I can say that this game is great for realism and accuracy. This is NOT COD, it actually takes time effort to learn how to hit a target with an assault rifle at 300 meters.  Fatigue actually has an effect on the game, you have to stop and catch your breath if you move too fast for the weight you caring if you want to actually hit anything. The enemy AI is intelligent, they actually get into cover when being shot at, and they have great accuracy when returning fire.  You can move freely in between infantry and mechanised roles, without loading screens. The numbers of each on you team actually have a big effect on the outcome, as well as how they are used, as most vehicles require multiple players to use them effectively, e.g. A tank needs a gunner driver and a commander to be effective.  Arma 3 improves greatly on Arma 2, and with over 300 hours spent between them I can defiantly say this game is worth buying 
1784	1	a	Amazing game, can be very realistic but also fun. DLCs are over-priced though so I would only buy them on a sale. The price of the game on the other hand is reasonable and is definetley worth the Â£30 as there is so much you can do with it. I've had 709 hours on this game and I am still not bored, which is nothing compared to some players with crazy hours. The workshop offers absolutely loads of mods that you can try so if you do get bored of the vanilla then you can always switch it up. Community has been fantastic so far and I've had a lot of fun on Vanilla servers with people that are not realism lovers so you don't have to get mods to enjoy the game and its community. I have not enjoyed some of the AI aimbot like powers though, AI really bugs me as I am constantly finding myself getting rekt by AI at stupid ranges so this can make the game less fun but is still great.
5102	0	a	unoptimized, has â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game modes i can get in garrys mod, all game modes require you to suck the admins male sexual organ just to get in, and good luck if you can find your friends, because this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ doesnt even tell you, no, it's not â¥â¥â¥â¥ing unrealistic to show you where your friends are, and it doesnt make the game more realistic, it makes it annoying and stupid. Overall, im glad i didnt spend 30 or 60 bucks on this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥astraphy because this game sucks major monkey caca, 2/10 id rather play duke nukem forever
4559	1	a	You know. This game is great! If you love flying helicopters and getting hookers!You will die to play this game forever! I know when i first bought it all i did was watch my guy sit on a rock! Its like im watching a second me watching another person play this game watching a hooker inside a game inside another game! what im trying to say is... This game has hookers!!!! GET IT!
1695	1	a	Brilliant game. plenty of:    servers,     scenarios,    workshop items     content   the editor is powerfull but the heli dlc is very overpriced and the free zeus dlc is very good. needs a little optimisation and bugfixing but other than that, one of my favorite games.
2462	1	a	someone buy this for me
3801	1	a	Arma 3 owns my life, no matter how mad I get at it sometimes, I'll always love it regardless. There is a endless amount of content due to mods that make this game even more amazing. It doesn't matter if your hardcore singleplayer like me or if hardcore multiplayer, there are gamemodes and scenarios for everyone. If you survival there's a server for that, if you love zombies there's a server for that, if you love realistic combat scenarios there's a server for that, if you love roleplay there's a server for that. If you're looking for a shooter that gives you a challenge but sometimes you like a break, Arma 3 is your game, I've played it for a little over 500 hours in about 2 years and I've enjoyed every second. All the death, the heart attacks when someone nearly shoots my head, and to all the people I've shot, I love all of it. The one thing however that bothers me the most is the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing DLC, but it's such a minor thing, but when you do actually go to pick up a certain weapon and it tells you that you can't because you require a certain DLC, it will make you want to blow your brains out. But even the DLC, Arma 3 will stay my favorite shooter for a very long time
4298	1	a	Best game ive ever played.
3134	1	a	Arma 3 itself has an amazing campaign, with a flowing storyline and plenties of moments to keep you on the edge of your seat. The voice acting isn't world class, but in this sort of game there's plenty else that's going to be taking your attention and immersing you in the story. The online is this game's highlight though, with an active community and a fairly easy to use scenario maker, people have really put some time and effort into making the best gamemodes and scenarios for you and your friends to try out. I'd recommend this game to anyone looking for someone to eat into their time budget, because you'll find yourself playing this game for hours. Whether you're into immersing yourself into a mil-sim multiplayer mode, or out to cut down waves of zombies on mods like Breaking Point, this game is for you. Plenty to do, lots of fun to be had, thumbs up!
4829	1	a	i dropped the soap
390	1	a	This game is amazing. Not only can you get just about any mod you want for it- you can get Breaking Point- DayZ in Arma. You can play Altis Life- make money and act a civilian or go do illegal things. You can play King Of The Hill- Get some PVP in. This is the best Multiplayer simulator and is definitely an amazing purchase that I've made and I'll never regret.
1252	1	a	Great Game, Great Modding Platform, Great Community.  if you liked Arma 2, you will most likely like Arma 3. Modding Community is really busy, Mod Content is nearly limitless.
3519	1	a	One of the best shooters out there on PC, playing it like CoD or Battlefield will just result in death. This game requires skill to progress, getting injured effects your characters movement and hiding does not regenerate health. Play this game if you want a challenge.
1878	1	a	watch out for the pistol bangerz in kavala
616	1	a	Arma 3 is a war simulator but gets used for a lot of other reasons example, wasteland altis life etc but there are a few problems with it as it still just been released example the FPS on servers are very bad and i know its not my computer as many other people has complained about it but overall it is worth the $60
1155	1	a	The level of fun and excitement I've had playing this game has not diminished a single bit since the day I first played it back in it's alpha stage 10/10.
1872	1	a	Met someone and he agreed to become an Organ farm.  Cut out all of his organs  Sell them  He respawns  Repeat
2627	1	a	Very nice, fixed what ARMA 2 had problems with. Still has some small problems. -Physics -FPS -Lag But really? Its Arma, get over it. 
1922	1	a	Self entitlement simulator, when you call the shots in your squad and you kill other players this crazy self entitlement kicks in and you spit hektick as â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ self entitlement at your squad mates, 'yeah see I told, I knew to come this way' 'bro don't doubt the queef' 'I know this s h i t bro, thats why I got 350 hours on it' 'didn't I tell you there was weapons caches here?' 'Bro trust I know my s h i t' 'detz whi Iym de bezt because trep armz bre'
1846	1	a	Great game! very fun to play with some friends. Mod support is awsome so the gameplay can be very diverse. 11/10
414	1	a	Incredible! Hours fly by while playing this. So many things to do in multiplayer, from Invade &amp; Annex (Massive COOP) to Altis Life (RP). Especially with friends its very enjoying! Don't have friends? No problem, join an already existing clan. Very good helicopter physics and the price is fair. Make sure you get the DLC bundle for the ultimate experience! Good luck, and have fun!
4961	1	a	-Plays battle royal, Survives hour and a half with good loot, gets in truck, drives into bush, truck stops working, gets out, truck explodes.- 10/10 so realistic.
1716	1	a	This is one of my favorite games that I own. I love the varied game modes and available mods that add to the game. The graphics can be a bit demanding but definitely pretty.
3475	1	a	Jog endlessly accross vast landscapes and get killed by people you never saw. Reminds me of all the things that sucked in the real Army. The Community also emulates all the retardation that surrounds the operation of Armed Forces. If you want tedious hours of boredom, unforgiving gameplay, a friend circle of maniacs and so forth, then yes, please do purchase this game.   Great game, I love it. A must have.
831	1	a	Arma 3 launcher has stopped working
262	1	a	Enemy, man, 10 kilometers away, bearing 420.  *BANG* Gets shot in the head. NPCs are broken dev plz fix.  10/10 ign  UPDATE DECEMBER 6TH 2016: 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny ^I'm not joking that's what it actually says^ My Specs: FX 8350, gtx 1050ti SC, 16gb of ram. Don't buy this game when it's $39.99, buy it when it's on sale for $19.99. It's a great game by itself but it's more fun if you have mods like exile, breaking point, or arma 3 life as they have many more servers and are way more fun. Campaign is slow at points, but has a better storyline than most other armas. Amazing graphics. NPC are still broken. One other thing about this game is that the updates make some mods bug, and not function, and the mods are what keeps the game alive, so if you have mods that are not working, you should go into properties and revert to an older version of arma to get them working again.
271	1	a	Not much to say appart that this game Rocks! its a learning process but fun as hell all the way. GJ on that one Bohemia.  Ps srr for the Bad english.
4542	1	a	I have killed like 5 people in all my playtime.
2584	1	a	so fun, so many mods, this game is awesome.
508	1	a	This is a really great game, I've enjoyed the arma series and with more optimizations this game runs better and looks nice. The physics are very good and not as glitchy as arma 2 but it still needs work. They are also still adding more features to the game and adding frequent updates.
4863	1	a	THE BEST GAME
2001	1	a	Wait, you're scrolling through the reviews as if you need to be convinced to buy this masterpiece?  Sometimes I lose faith in humanity.
4894	1	a	Awesome,simply the ultimate military simulation. Fantastic graphics and visual and pure realism. Incredible weapons feedback and perfect accuracy of balistic and physical.  Many awesome user missions such as: Altis life RPG, Wasteland and many more .   
2465	1	a	Arma3 I must say is ummmm...  Lets start over, Arma3 is a well thought out game by far. The mods are wonderful and most of the time you can't go to sleep after logging on :).  My opinion.  I believe with a little more optpmizing on server side/ Company side this game could not be beat out by any other game on the market. Arma3 is a mix of things.  If you want fast paced. BAM - ARMA3  If you want slow paced. BAM -ARMA3  If you want great and releastic gun fights/military simulated. BAM - ARMA3  If you want a very minimum amount of hackers (as in I have encountered 0, YES 0 in 258 hours time played. Then BAM -ARMA3  If you want great AI encounters. BAM - ARMA3  Want to pick from many different mod's... Epoch, Battleroyale, Altis Life RP, Wasteland, King oh the hill, choose what you like best.  Choppers, military vehicles, awsome guns, what more can you want.. oh yea 1000000 FPS :P  A few negatives are the bugs. 1. Dying randomly from stairs, getting in vehicles, falling 5 feet, falling 2 feet, running to fast :P,  2. vehicles blowing up for no reason, blowing up in garages from spawning in diferent directinons. 3. umm nothing else i guess :)   Arma3 I would by far recommend to any and everyone my first hour of gameplay I quit, uninstalled and did not try again for 4 months. Well then I was hooked. As long as you can run it due to the optimization your good to go, Hopefully in the future the updates will get pushed faster and less bugs but that wont stop me.  Give it a try you wont regret it.
3955	1	a	The game is great, its very glitchy and needs to fix bugs but overall is one of my favorite games.
2174	1	a	Just pure awesomeness for everyone.
310	1	a	Damn, if this is only the Alpha, what can we expect in the beta and the full game?!
2960	1	a	this is really great game the graphics are sexy playing with your friends is mad banter yep what more do you want?
57	1	a	After some 1,400 hours on the game, I can say with FULL VALIDITY this game has ruined my life. If you like realistic physics, teamwork, and every form of warfare, this game is for you. 10/10
2458	1	a	:3
3204	1	a	Great game, different mods, such as wasteland / king of the hill.  Really enjoyable   Badly optimized (FPS) 
379	0	a	Full of bugs paid $80 for game then they bring out DLC's!! The dog's want me to buy plus if you don't have said DLC's you get spamed constantly If i ever meet the Devs i will kickem right in the nuts
3409	1	a	Great game so many different game mods and is a great role-play game definatly worth the price. I highly advise buying this game!!
1405	1	a	Best Game to Waste Money one period
3034	1	a	One of the best games out if you ask me. If you love military shooter games and love to actually play as team and not just play some type BF or Call of duty where you just run around shoot â¥â¥â¥â¥ you will enjoy this game. Campiagn is a decent lenght(if you play on the hardest settings it will take you weeks lol) but the MP is where the game shines. I personallly play on co-op servers that run Invade and Annex or Patrol Ops and its almost like playing a real war(I highly recommend the 7thcavalry co-op servers). You do get the MP servers that run stupid â¥â¥â¥â¥ like Wasteland(dayz rip off but worse) or Atlis life(â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Sims ripoff) but thats not what this game is about. Do you love the thrill of hearing the bullets fly past your head or want to pilot a transport helio or attack helio giving the ground forces some cover and take out the armor or maybe you want to jump in a tank to lighten up the enemies forces or a artillery vehicle and use the VIOP to have the forces closer to the fight mark or even use there laser guided scope to spot targets and light them up.  This game has finally fillled the hole in my heart for a REAL war shooter that I have been begging and praying for the last 20 years. This is the closeest game you will get to the real thing! I HIGHLY recommend getting this game.
3816	1	a	A cheaper and longer lasting GF replacement.
1171	1	a	how do i play this game???
4964	0	a	I like the hardcore nature of it but it is just inaccessable. You wait ages for something to happen and when it does you are often killed quickly and have to start alll over. Arma 3 I want to like you!!
1786	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME FOR LIFE!
1585	1	a	This game is what PC gaming is all about! Arma 3 Da Beast!
4407	1	a	1. Bought Arma 3 2. Joined Altis Server 3. Got robbed twice by the same guys when was on the way from apple fields. 4. Joined to them as a bait 5. Proven my self, got a gun. 6. Called police 7. Get them arrested 8. Profit. mlg  Would collect apples again. 11/1
3715	1	a	This is a must-have game for everyone that is interested in modern war and such.
86	1	a	I ran a marathon without leaving my chair.  11/10
1780	1	a	Eh, its ok.
111	1	a	Great military sim/shooter, tons of mods and unlimited possibilities for different types of fun.
782	1	a	So far this has been one of my favorite games.
17	1	a	Great game, but I cannot justify recommending to friends to pay $40 USD for this game when its literally over 10 years old. Get it when its on special
24	1	a	Age of Empires 3  Genre: Strategy - Real Time Strategy Rating: 10/10 Personal playing period: 5+ years Is it worth a buy: Yes. Even at full price. This is a necessity for any strategy players collection. Girl vs Game: Unless it's some super model I'd definately rather play the Game.  Personal Comment: This is an amazing game with endless amounts of game time. The hours on here isnt a fraction of my actual game time online and offline. Been playing this game since the day it was released and still play it and love it today. I even missed a couple of meals as well as toilet breaks playing this believe it or not. I have bladder and bowel control of a ninja thanks to AOE.  Online gaming: The online gaming community is still very active and people of all skill levels are on it. You will find anywhere between 500 to 2000 people online at any given time. Beware though that even though AOE is helpful and awesome the online community are sometimes a bunch of cocktonsil nimrod supremists who think they're amazing whilst never having seen or felt a girl up close unless in a magazine. But if your skin is thick and you dont give a flying **** about other people you'll be fine.  Short Summary: This is a real time strategy game that plays off in the medieval times. There are 8 standard civilizations, 3 native indian civilizations and 3 Asian civilizations. Each civ provides a different set of advantages and it takes time to learn how to utilise the various civs to their full capability. Learning each civilisation takes time and it is great fun doing that. There are countless amounts of maps that allow for the use of different strategies. The game also has a story rich single player campaign. I have not played the campaign yet but never felt the need to as the standard game modes offer more than enough fun and game time. The game also has progressive improvement meaning the more you play the more items get unlocked and the stronger your civilisation becomes. This ensures that you want to play more and more in order to improve the strength of your favourite civilisation.  Learning Curve and Gameplay: Easy to start but tough to master. The learning curve to start playing and learning the basics is very easy. Learning the various civilisations and their strengths is more challenging and may take a lot of practice and time. The gameplay is very simplistic in it being a basic RTS with click and place. Gathering of basic resources and using those resources are easy and self explanotary. A tutorial can be played to understand the basics but this game is very playable and a new player will get it after playing only for a few hours.
2975	1	a	What can I say other than this game is so amazing that it has stolen almost 3,000 hours of my life #nerdlife
639	1	a	Have had a blast playing Epoch, Breaking Point and most recently Wasteland. 1000 hrs and still going. Can't get enough of it.
3534	1	a	Negative reviews fueled by angsty console junkies â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off that they can't hipshoot and bunny hop everywhere. If you really like unreal tournament style shooters, go play something else. If you think battlefield or call of duty is too hard core, this game will hand you your â¥â¥â¥ and send you back to the forums crying.   There's a reason some military groups use it as a training simulator. It's not for punk kids.
1433	1	a	It's pretty cool
1873	1	a	This is a really fun and addicting game!!!
5151	0	a	The Game was absolutely beautiful to look at, Graphics were on target 100% but if your a first time Arma player the user friendly version is not there. Leaves you completely disoreinted almost immediately. Camera views while inside the vehicle leave you going for the number pad's 0 key a lot. Once outside the vehicle your camera's axis is only in the up down view there is no 360 view here boys/ girls. It does however have the genuine military simulation feel. For the amount of times it use the F-Bomb you'd think you were on a military boat. Hence the term make a sailor blush. All in all I'd give it a 6 out 10.
2126	1	a	Awesome shooter game
4078	1	a	The Arma series has become an amazing masterpiece throughout its past 15 years of development. With backing from previous games and mods such as Arma 2 and the DayZ mod the developers have made it into a work of art. Arma 3 really finalizes the series for me, with more DLCs on the way and improved bullet ballistics and combat realism this truly is the mil-sim to rule them all. Along with the addition of the Apex expansion came more weapons and vehicles which drastically improved gun variety and the number of combat situations. Overall amazing game and I would definitely reccomend it if you like 'Serious Fun' (in Shack Tac terms) then you need to get this game.
591	0	a	No. Just... No.  Arma 3 has a very bad community, a mate of mine said it had good community so i joined and got left by my own squad. I dislike this game also because of the price. cost me $60 USD for a game where i couldnt even play as a civilian on RP. The Graphics are extremely high and i could run them fine with my Nvidia GeForce GXT... and the graphics are beaustiful. Amazing Graphics, HUGE map. Lots of content but definitly something i would NOT recommend.   Shame that the people in Arma 3 ruinned a perfectly good game.  5/10 bad comuntty
2601	1	a	Great tactical shooter/sim . The game needs more team on team . Im not a big fan of playing AI .
1614	1	a	It's amazing game with great community around and huge modding potential. Go for it!
3437	1	a	great game with great mods. the game requires patience and alot of time to get into since 1 game might last +12h. the game doesnt have constaint action but when it does its very tense and nice since all it takes is 1-3 shots and your dead. the game has a massive map somewhere around 270 squarekilometers giving you lots of space to run around aimlessly if you dont know what to do. the game has multiple different vehicle types such as: civilian cars, ATV's, APC's, tanks, jets, helicopters, armored cars, boats and submarines. you have lots of choices in this game and the game needs thinking. you cant just run in middle of city with an machinegun holding the trigger and hoping to do something useful. the instant you get spotted running in middle of open field you will most likely die. arma is a great game series and they have tons of player made mods. arma 3 finally got dayz aswell for those who dont care about arma itself, sure theres dayz standalone but arma 3 dayz breaking point has somewhere like 500 zombies in a city who walk slowly isntead of empty cities with tom the floorzombies. in arma 3 dayz breaking point zombies are a treath and will swarm you if you stay in one place for too long. but anyways performance of the game is not the best, you will need a high end pc to run it properly. you can check if you can run it from  canyourunit.com  if you think you can run it and you have the patience to play i would recommend this game.
1534	1	a	A fantastic game, easy to get into, difficult to master. Best tactical combat game out there, bar none.
969	1	a	10/10
5257	1	a	THE BEST ARMY SIMULATOR IN THE WORLD!
821	1	a	Logged almost 3100 hours on ARMA 3.... !!! Its incredible. Taken over my life.... Absolutely the best game ever. It is worth the money and the upper-end machine you'll need to fully enjoy it.  Join a clan and enduldge yourself in the awesome multiplayer maps, especially the wastland servers. What are you waiting for? Its the closest thing to real war you'll ever experience.
1854	1	a	Experiences with helicopters:  Very first game: Get in small chopper with five guys and fly for about six minutes to meet a contact. Upon reaching him, I promptly shot him as I didn't see a nameplate.  Some time later: Get in back of dual rotor troop transport with ~6 other troops. Get near LZ, high power shot passes through the hull behind my head, whistles past me and wrecks my SL who was briefing us on the mission.  Several days later: Time to try the pilot class. What could go wrong? I task myself with evacing a small squad on the ground under heavy enemy fire. I get about a kilometer away, when enemy AA takes out my engine and some other fancy control things. With what I could control, I maneuvered around while trailing black smoke calling MAYDAY over the group chat. I hit the ground hard, somehow still intact, and grind along the terrain for at least a hundred meters, tearing my rotor off on a nearby tree and hitting a few enemy soldiers during the powerslide. I crawl out of the wreckage barely alive, and talk through the radio to reassure them that I survived. I then hear the ground team over the radio saying that their mission was now a rescue op. To them, they saw a helo closing in to land, only to crash in the most violent way possible, pretty much cutting a path to me. They made it just as I got shot up.    Bravo Squad's final stand: This happened earlier today and had my heart pounding, our ten man squad was deployed in the open completely surrounded by enemies. Within seconds of disembarking, enemy fire cut down a few of us, who we were forced to leave up on the hill. We all scrambled down in different directions to find tiny pieces of cover while we waited for our attack chopper to open fire. He did, but was promptly hit and crash landed a quarter mile away. With our remaining men, we moved down the valley toward the wreckage, finding him incapacitated next to the cockpit. On a quick head count, we found that our combat medic had been killed in the opening wave and we had no way to save him in the field. While our SL called for a medevac, I picked up the pilot and pulled him into a small house, which we quickly garrisoned. By this time, we were down to five of our original team, plus one of our own wounded and the pilot. Our requests for a medevac quickly turned into an extraction request, which was accepted by a pilot nearly 10km away.  We held for several minutes, until we started to hear the chopper getting close to our position. My SL had been shot in the face through a window, along with our marksman. The incoming pilot essentially told us that we had ten seconds after he touched down to get on board or he would have to leave. Aware of this, I picked up the heli pilot, an engineer picked up our SL, and our other autorifleman followed behind us, giving covering fire. the engineer reached the chopper. loaded our SL into the back and jumped in, giving supporting fire. I reached the chopper next, and just as I got the pilot inside, a shot hit me in the back and incapacitated me. Our rifleman turned to me, and in that moment got shot in the arm.  He just yelled at our pilot to go, the fire was too much to stay. Not even five seconds after dustoff, an enemy sniper caught him.  You could say I'm enjoying the game.
4903	1	a	  so much fun. a good friend gifted this to me and only a few hours in and its so fun! you should try it
543	1	a	The greatest game/simulation ever!  kid play COD, boy play battle field, man play arma I played arma for near 2000 hour and I decided to write a review now. As a player who saw all the development and effort of Bohemia Interactive, the online player number maintain so long that exceed my previous expectation! This can't be done without all the players' love and effort from Bohemia!
3460	1	a	Arma 3 is one of those games you hate, but you still play it because it is so good.  Arma 3 is unique in how it plays out but without doubt has some flaws. A common problem is optimization; this problem is a big one considering if you would like to play on a server with a decent amount of players, you will be ploughed down to 30 frames per second or below. It can be a horrible experience. However, with the right tweaks to the game you can easily run it at 100 fps+ (in singleplayer) with decent specs (if you would consider a 560 ti and i5 3570 as somewhere between good and bad). I suspect that the framerate problem on servers may because how the Arma server is designed, but that is for bohemia to improve.  For out this Arma 3 is a brilliant designed game in the manner that pretty much everything you'll find on the server browser is user made. To the extent where a mod or mission may completely overcome the 'Military simulator' aspect of the game. At one point I even found a mod where you played as a robot car war machine, just like that old tv show with the bots fighting in an arena.   If you are into tactics and survival, wasteland might be the place for you, with the constant feeling of being watched by someone with a very big weapon, while attempting to gear up so you can fight back. Alternatively, the great feeling of wiping a 5-man squad purely based on your skill and intelligence, by outplaying them. If you are into big battles, king of the hill is something you may like. With giant battles going on, including infantry, armoured cars, and air support. Even if these things are not for you, Altis life might be. With the biggest (or one of the biggest) player-base in Arma, the incredible Altis life is really something in its own. You start out by being a civilian with nothing, where you get to choose a path of Justice as a police officer, medic or something alike. Alternatively, if you strive after being the biggest drug lord on the server by harvesting crops and processing them into drugs to sell. On the other hand, if you simply just want to pluck apples for a little cash you can do that as well. For you Garryâs mod veterans, this is pretty much the DarkRP of Arma.  And if none of these are something that you'd spend time playing, why not grab a text editor and start scripting a mission exactly how you'd want it!  Though I recommend this game, I would like to point out that it is not that fun to play alone; you definitely need some friends to play with.
3607	1	a	Arma still is totally in lead of militarybased shooter/sim category. The best
4012	1	a	Arma 3 is really fun, but sometimes can get really boaring when not playing wiht anyone or without interacting with other players.
4520	1	a	Best shooter since, well, arma2. Make sure you try its wasteland mod, specifically sa-matras wasteland. the only legit version of it. Arguably arma2's version of wasteland is better, but arma3 is the future.   pros: realism  cons: not enough realism (sci fi elements)
2046	1	a	arma 3 is one of my favoret games it very fun and competative
3468	1	a	I have to say, This game is dam realistic :), AND PERFECT! even without that mod called DayZ
1682	1	a	It's got it's fair amount of bugs but it's a great game.  Best played with a group.
2887	1	a	Very good game when playing with friends and by far the most realistic one I have seen
643	1	a	Very Enjoyable game, with a HUGE variety of games, mods, players, and etc. None the less, the game is entertaing and itll suit about any player if they find their 'community'  Greatest Game I've Played Yet.
4427	1	a	Hmm... Where do I start... Well, imagine this scenerio. You and 5 of your best friends are told by a commander to please take out an enemy/ hostile base. You have an amazing pilot who takes you there. Its night time and you and your crew are all in the chopper getting ready to attack. Ropes come down from the chopper and you and your 4 friends land on the ground. Immedatley one of your friends gets sniped right beside you. The chopper lands and the pilot is asking what happended. You put your friend on your shoulders and start taking him to the chopper for a heal up. The pilot starts giving him CPR. You and your friends go towards the enemy base. Taking them out with advanced stategies and tactics. Finally you finish them off. One of your teammates was hit. He's losing blood. You throw smoke for a helicopter extraction. The pilot responds with an ok and heads towards your direction. You tell your friend he's gonna make it as the helicopter becomes visible. The helicopter starts descending when BAM it gets it. Its starts falling and explodes one of your guys goes down. Another rushes in to save him and catches fire and burns to death. Its just you and the guy that limping holding each others shoulders heading back to base far, far away. Your friends gets shot while going over a hill. He dies as you try to save him. You keep walking as suddenly you see a car approaching. Enemys come out as you put your hands up. One pulls the trigger, then again your getting shot constantly. You fall on your knees. Someone shoots you in the head. You fall... And its over.  This is just ONE of my hundreds of experiences with gamemodes from Battle Royale to Serious RP to Wasteland, King of the Hill and so forth. I could never recommend a game so much...
4188	0	a	This game could be so much better if they fixed the ai. Was the same in arma 2 and unfortunately nothing has changed. Stealth is dead enemies will spot you in the dark 200 meters away or from a moving helicopter while your underwater. It is so inconsistant and really kills the immersion when concealment is moot.  Instead of enemies getting smarter on higher difficulties they just get aim bots. Got to the point where even sticking my head out of cover for a split second meant death from a distant machinegun headshot. Thats not more challenging its just cheap.  Best thing about this game is the editor.
3119	1	a	Very fun game. Alot of game modes like Battle Royale. Wasteland and other stuff. Buy it NOW WHEN ITS -50%
3803	1	a	Try to be best âCause you're only a man And a man's gotta learn to take it Try to believe Though the going gets rough That you gotta hang tough to make it History repeats itself Try and you'll succeed Never doubt that you're the one And you can have your dreams!

3284	1	a	This is a good game
1926	1	a	This game is an amazing game the great graphics, although it takes quite a demanding PC to experience the game fully. I would highly recomend this game if you are in RP or realistik shooting tanks jets it goes on and on.
5108	0	a	I'm gonna get slammed for this review, but you know me:  Arma 3 was recommended to me by a mutual friend at the time, so I looked into it, as well as insisting to pay $60 'the price of a full game' for a shooter that was released over 2 years ago.   I thought I would be amazed with Arma 3... I wasn't.  First strike, I was met with poor optimization and horrendous frame rate issues, even with the terrible looking standard graphics the maximum frames I could only achieve 27. I can already hear everyone shouting 'You're PC is trash! Git gud, Stealth...Poorass.' I will have you know that this is quite the machine I have with an AMD Radeon R7 370 Graphics.  Arma 3's single player offering is a joke. It's worse than Star Wars Battlefront EA singleplayer. After the first mission I just stopped. But then I tried Arma's multiplayer, what the game is praised for. Now I do respect that Arma 3 is supposed to be one of the most realistic military shooters on the market. But perhaps its a bit... too realistic... You're going to spend more time walking with your squad from point A to point B, getting lost and checking your map and compass often alot more than actually fighting in the game.- I've only been in 1 firefight. I would take Battlefield over Arma any day.   I was going to rate Arma 3 a 5. But gets held back to a 4/10 due to it's poor optimization, terrible AI, and dull gameplay.  This was my first refund on Steam and I couldn't be happier to get my full $60 back.  That's gonna do it for Arma 3 and I will see you on the next review. Let's form up! ~Stealth 1548
3261	1	a	pretty sick m8
2455	1	a	this is an amazing game as a fps as well as enabling the player a truely immersive realism experiance the multiplayer experiance of the game is truely second to none with community members contributing maps and missions to the steam workshop as well as community modders hard at work the potential for this game is quite limitless
3372	1	a	Great game, but BI's failure to optimise their Arma engine disappoints the majority of the community. EA was able to run BF4 on a tablet, perhaps they should learn for them.
5155	0	a	game is dog â¥â¥â¥â¥ needs optimization. 2/10
2571	1	a	Comparing Arma 2 to Arma 3. Arma 2 has more content, but Arma 3 has more features. Once it has all the content it will be fantastic
2654	1	a	Arma 3 is a very good first/third person war simulator that successfully simulates what is actually like to fight in battles. And lets say you getting bored with some of the standared war scenarios then you can easily download a mod off of workshop and play that instead. Arma 3 is defintely for you if your looking for a fun game that really captures good gun play and enhanced environments.
1424	1	a	So, after 1206 hours I have to say: I hate you and I love you but I still hate you.  I played every ARMA title and the one thing that never changes is the broken gameplay. Bigger Maps? Yep. Nice graphics? You got it. New thingies and stuff? Kinda, here you go.  BUT you still hang in doorframes, start levitating on balconies and egdes, you can't enter a room smoothly, the ballistics are simply â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t at times, your character does every action soooooooo slooooow, servers with 3rd person are absolutely useless because people just sit behind walls seeing you without exposing themselfs and shoot you in the back, the weapons sway is outraging (I am a former soldier and no one except a halfspastic baboon during an epileptic episode would be THIS all over the place), the body armor is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t in its durability and it extends into uncovered areas (I always aim into the hips but it makes no difference to hitting the center of the chest where the lvl IV would sit), they FINALLY implemented bipods and weaponresting but they did a worse job than all the community-mods for this and older ARMA titles...I could go on and on. And if you play King of the Hill or something like this, your framerate will drop right trough the floor no matter what specs you have.  It's a good game, the best there is because there is no other like it. And that's probably why the devs don't really care about optimising it or getting rid of all these bugs and inconveniences that have been a trademark of ARMA since the start. I would love to have a game with half the graphics and more realistic details like proper dimension and ballistics of body armor, not poking out of every wall with parts of my body, entering a room without hanging on 50 points of the door or getting pushed into the wall by it.....the bugs are so many and they are soooooo old and stupid.  And after going into the whole DLC-pay-for-it (marksmen was absolutely not worth it by content) they now even come up with a new map that must be bought seperately. I wager the same bugs will be in there, the same old crap, but the graphics will be nice.  I like ARMA and I really try to overlook it's shortcomings but it becomes so annoying. I bought the Marksmen DLC against better knowledge and I will definately not buy any other DLC.
4365	1	a	1650+ hours and I still fall in love with Arma 3 all over again when I play a well executed mission.
459	1	a	 http://i.imgur.com/YQm3PT2.gif 
5105	0	a	I keep trying to play this game but I just can't enjoy it because I get 9-20 fps with a i5 cpu and gtx 970 gpu... The game is horrible because of this... When Arma fixes their fps issues then the game will be the best fps and 3rd person shooter ever to exist. I beg them to fix their game... I as well as many others desperately want to play this with a managable framerate.
3716	1	a	  This game is quite good should buy if u have the money and love war/military stuff
3488	1	a	This is the most adicting, most realistic war game out there. Don't come and expect COD because this is real war. It takes time to get some things done just like in real life. This is a war SIMULATOR not a fast paced shootem up FPS. Best most addicting game i have ever played. I used to be a Battlefield junkie but this takes the cake sorry to say.
4133	1	a	This game is hella good you can go from Helicopters, Jets, Boats, Submarines, Parachutes, On Foot... You can do anything that you want freely the choice is up to you. You want too explore you can but...   You always must use caution you never know if/when you will be shot at from any direction, any height, any distance and from any type of challenge wether it's Planes Boats, Tanks, Mines, Enemies aka Troops and Paratroopers you name it..  You can also create Missions for you and your friends to play, you can also do anything set on your mind.. But you must follow Server Rules, if you don't want too be Kicked/Banned.   You can also do Solo Missions, the Campaign, Training ANYTHING! This game has a ton of Mods! So what are you waiting for BUY NOW!!
5340	1	a	Really cool game, nice graphics and fun gamemodes!
2102	1	a	Great Quality game with a variety of things you can do and play, the community is very big and there are a lot of mods. Bare in mind that this is a semi simulator in my perspective, not a cod, but overall i love this game and btw dont sell cocaine in arma life ;)
4652	0	a	this game is good and all.. but its complete garbage. first of all its fun..... when it actually works... i bought the game for 40 bucks. had fun... but now i cant even â¥â¥â¥â¥ing connect to stupid piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ server without the game â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ing about how its stopped working. if it worked 10/10. but its so â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ i have to give it a 0/10
143	1	a	The most comprehensive military sim out there, setting you loose on a massive island with all of the weapons, vehicles and scenarios you could possibly wish for.  The game itself has remained almost unchanged since the original Operation Flashpoint, released over 10 years ago. However, of all the iterations, Arma 3 is the one that has improved things the most. These aren't big changes, but merely small gameplay tweaks that make it feel more polished and smooth.  Graphically, it's convincing. It isn't always beautiful but it gets the atmosphere of a real place just right and the large view distances are key to making it feel ALIVE. You can tell that the developers did their homework when researching the island that this game is based on (Yup, it is a real place).  If you don't know anything about this game, the best word to sum it up with would be 'realistic'. You are a single soldier in a large, real-time conflict. You can die from a single bullet or stray shell and alone you have limited influence over how the battle will go. Expect to be crawling through muddy fields or cowardly hiding behind cover as bullets whiz overhead. Don't expect to behave like Rambo and to survive.  I wouldn't consider this game 'complete' just yet- for months they have been rolling out updates and patches and at the time of writing, the main campaign is only 1/3 released. That being said, it's the community that really supports this game. Mods like Dayz show how flexible and open-ended the game can be. Really, Arma 3 can be seen as offering an island and great multiplayer support, letting the community come up with the best content.  Personally, I haven't spent much time in the large-scale multiplayer side of things. I prefer playing missions with a friend and those experiences have been enjoyable and memorable. Expect a single objective to take a while and for it to get rather frustrating as you die through seemingly no fault of your own. I've also spent a lot of time simply exploring the large island. Yup, on my own, with no NPCs or other players. I love the sights and sounds. I love exploring over the next mountain, or lounging about on a beach, soaking up the digital rays. I don't expect other people to find that fun and neither does the game- the fantastic mission editor simply opens up countless opportunities for you and I chose one of the most dull and mundane simply to see how much enjoyment I could extract from it.  The community is what makes this product what it is. They're serious but loyal and will likely be playing this game for years to come. You'll make good friends if you behave in a sensible and team-worthy fashion and thanks to the Steam workshop support there are thousands of mods and maps to download to boost the number of scenarios the game has to offer.  Buying this game is an investment. The developers and community have pledged their loyalty to build it into a must-have title, though it could take several years to reach that stage. Don't expect gameplay that's easy to jump in to, nor should you expect a fun standalone experience. But this game is no COD. By default it's not a mainstream game, but the possibilities it offers you are almost endless.
2389	1	a	This is the best FP(Tactical)S by far, I don't think there is any real competition out there. Unlike most other FPS's, this gem of a game has longevity. Yes you have a Campaign Mode and other SinglePlayer/Multiplayer scenarios {made by an ever growing army of fans} which you can download from the ARMA III Workshop but you also get to create your own missions in the Mission Editor/Creator, I don't think there are many(if any) other FPS's that offer that much depth in their games.
2807	1	a	This game is actually really fun. My pc was pretty dang bad when I looked at the specs so that's my bad for being stupid. I decided to get a new pc and now its fun.
4525	1	a	The very best Arma that has ever been made, great Game.
3975	0	a	dont buy this game. its not finished. there is no story, there are bugs, ai is stupid,........ bohemia doesnÂ´t give a â¥â¥â¥â¥ about releases they promised. we are still waiting for the 2nd part of the campaign that should have been released - as promised - in december. now the tell us it will be february. its a sanbox and without community developers this game would worth 0.- I highly recomment to wait a few months.
4741	1	a	So along time ago i did a review on this game. But now im older and i understand more about what i said so heres a new one.   I love this arma its not as good as cold war or Arma 2 but its still just as much fun. I play this one alot and as im writing this im playing it i do think you should get the game because its alot of fun and has alot of things you can do in it like.... King of the hill, Life, Coop and much much more   What i like to do is go in the editor and make mission for myself and my friends and we have alot of fun with that also theres so many mods if you dont like the factions in the game you can just go online and download more.
4861	1	a	Great game!
2382	1	a	I can't say enough good things about ARMA 3. This is a game for someone who wants a truly lifelike military sandbox. This is not COD or BF; for the most part, run and gun tactics will only get you shot and killed here. You will have to think quickly and thoroughly to plan your assaults, escapes, etc. You will die a lot initially until you learn how to properly strategize and utilize the assets at your disposal but you will have fun doing it.   The Bohemia content is a blast to play and replay but where this game really shines is in the wealth of community created content that offers something for everyone. The level editor makes it easy to create your own scenarios and tailor missions to your specific desires and play styles. Truth be told I would pay the $60.00USD for this game just to play the Breaking Point mod (think DayZ using Arma3 engine/maps) but either way, the game was well worth the money.
5259	1	a	Best Military game so far!
3080	1	a	Really nice game.. Beautiful aswell. Just the campaign made me rage xD 
2697	1	a	There is so much to do in this game it's insane. I would go so far as to say that it's an adult Garry's mod due to all the different possibilities with Arma. Every gametype, every mod has a community to go with it. You get so engrossed into any good server you could easily invest 50+ hours in one week when find something new. You can play at least 100-200 hours of Battle Royale easily, or maybe 50-250+ on invade and annex (depending on how hardcore you are). Maybe king of the hill is more of your thing? Go play 300 hours of that in a week. Or possibly you want a better DayZ than the standalone? Go spend 600+ hours roaming a single map looking for loot and building up your base, +more hours for every map. You like little kids screaming at you because theyre a cop and are immune to the rules? Waste your life away playing any of the life mods.  And that's just the tip of the iceberg, and I think this is the perfect example of that saying.  There is just so much to enjoy about ARMA3. It's a lot more user friendly than previous titles and is much improved from previous titles as well... didn't substanially change anything so veterans of the franchise will miss it, but rather they worked on it and added more. Nothing about this game did they mess up making the previous ones better, it's still ARMA.  It may be a little hard to learn at first, as the IGN review gives it a 7/10 because the reviewer simply did not give it enough time to learn it, but it all pays off. Once you learn to think like a member of something bigger than you, or even that youre bigger than a group, and learn how to manage everything, you'll be having a blast.   THE LEARNING CURVE IS WORTH IT!!!    When you find games with people who have thousands of hours on it (ie CSGO, SKYRIM, ARMA...) you know it's a good game, why else would anyone spend 1000+ hours of their life playing something? Because they think it's okay? NO, because they love it.      TL:DR Just â¥â¥â¥â¥ing buy it already you pleb    
5109	0	a	Great game, But if you plan on playing multiplayer. Expect to get banned by Battleye. Played this franchise since Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis back in 2001 up to the split between Codemasters and Bohemia Interactive. Onto the ARMA franchise. Never cheated and now it's completely unplayable on multiplayer. Battleye has ruined this game for me. They even ban your steam account. Can't just rebuy the game...
5287	1	a	It's ok
1329	1	a	best dance simulator in history
3929	1	a	I parachute into a hot zone. I hear the distant crackle of small arms fire. Kind of like fireworks. 4th of July... I snap out of it as the ground suddenly rushes up and meets me. I roll onto my stomach and crawl into a nearby bush. I jumped with 3 squad mates. Where are they? I glance around. One comes drifting down dead in his harness. The other is nowhere to be found. Tension builds in my belly as the chatter of nearby automatic weapons fire starts back up again. I gaze cautiously out into the outcropping of squat buildings ahead.   Is that where the fire is coming from? I can't tell. Can't be sure.  I am frozen.   There is a house across the street. The street is narrow. I could dash for it. But it might blow my cover. 50 meters never looked so far in my life. I get into a crouch. Glance around again. Suddenly I see smoke rising from a dusting of rocks to my left. I immidiately drop down and toss a grenade. It works, the enemy tango dashes from the rocks. A few swift pops and he's down. Was he alone?   There was no way to know for sure.   This is warfare. This is Arma.
2222	1	a	great game besides driving a car. jesus.
3239	1	a	This game is amazing i cant believe i havent heard of it untill recently! multiplayer is where its at because on the majority of servers i play, nothing is handed to you except a pistol. you have to fight and scavange for weapons and supplies. everything(especially helicopters) is extremely realistic. 9/10
2769	1	a	A great all round game that can be modded to do almost anything you enjoy, there are servers for RP, mass carnage, and then there is the popular Exile mod that i enjoy playing alot on as well due to the crazy amount of weapons that extra mods can bring to the game and various new ways you can hunt other players.
2900	1	a	Bought it this morning, pretty good so far 10/10
5030	1	a	Greatest slideshow ive ever seen!
4265	1	a	I Strongly recommend getting this game to anyone that has a good PC and enjoys the likes of battlefield and maybe Call of Duty and anyone that has previously owned a AmrA Game  
2245	1	a	Severely underated game. Even with it's growing popularity, it's still overlooked by many many people. Trying to get my friends to play it is a chore, probably because they're too pansy to make any effort to get through the learning curve.
1752	1	a	Massive improvement from Arma 2, but unfortunately the DLC's are very very pricey and in my opinion not really worth the money as the base game itself only costs very little more than the APEX dlc.   
2294	1	a	absolutely the best Arma by far i just cant seem to stop playing it.
2944	1	a	Audio 9/10 Graphics 9/10 Gameplay 10/10 Action 10/10  This game is very fun and it has a lot of gamemodes, for example, wastleland wich is very action packed.  I Recommend this game!!
2536	1	a	pretty cool geam wit sum hardcore military type peeple that take gaem way 2 srsly. very fun 2 like screw around in n stuff. combat is fun an u can pretend u r like a cool kid soldir fiting in a war wit utter solders. r8 laggy n â¥â¥â¥â¥ if u dun have mega awesome cumpooter lik3 me. If it is laggie den turn down (4 wat. Lol i kool kid now) ur graphics and adjust dem in da gam so it like is optimized n â¥â¥â¥â¥ 4 ur system k? Since vilence n stuff in da game is not so gewd for the yungins.
1465	1	a	If its on sale buy it, if the dlc are on sale too buy the marksmen one but dont pay full price :/
709	1	a	it's worth the $60  it's not worth the trip to the hospital after i clipped through the ground for the 86th time
4799	1	a	Great game. Would be great with more weapons and a useable bipod. Controller support is great; just a few button maps don't seem to work. Awesome game overall. 9/10 would eat.
124	1	a	This game is just bad! ;) But honestly this game took my life and made it worth living... I've made so many friends playing this game that I can't even count, as well as some rivals. &lt;3 Arma 3 gives you a way to escape reality and have fun. So many different things to do that I can't even begin to explain. Just buy the game. Best decision you will ever make if you are looking to meet people especially. Or if you are just looking to shoot people or fly helicopters or jets or coordinate attacks. You can go into the heat of battle and save lives, or go in and take lives. This game will teach you how to use a compass too city boy and how to drive offroad, just watch out for them twig bushes they are deadly.    P.S nothing gives me more pleasure than taking a helicopter full of 15 geared men and crashing it into the ground ! LOL I love this game. Just kiddin, best pilot NA Combat land veteran.. Also after 3k hours in game I still play and have fun everytime I play. This game is just simply a must buy. 10/10
370	0	a	Inferior in every way to ARMA 2: Combined Ops.  -Insanely Overpriced DLC -20 years, still no AI or Netcode improvement? -Absolutetly Tiny collection of vehicles and weapons compared to the last game -Altis and Stratis don't have the atmosphere of Chernaurus -Game essentially bullies you into buying DLC  +Animations are much smoother +Firefights do feel more alive  I can't, in good faith, recommend this game over Arma 2:CO, especially that the servers have migrated to steam. What my main gripe is the DLC - $15 for 7 guns? Another $15 for 2 helicopters? $35 for an Island that is very similiar to already community made maps? Not worth near as much as they are charging.   Also, the community is probably the most toxic I've seen - and I've played 300 hours of Rust.  EDIT: There is also a catastrophically game-breaking bug that forces the FPS down to 5, and makes everything go lowpoly and low res. To top it off, it always seems to happen in the most critical of moments.
96	1	a	You can run through the battlefield in just your underwear.   10/10
1955	1	a	arma 3 is a great game but i wish i would have known about the free weekend a bit earlier so i could injoy it a bit more. even with two days of the game i got to experince alot like all the funny mini games and the amazing campain. i would for sure buy this game if i were you.
3838	1	a	10/10
3404	1	a	Drives over guy with a Heavy Armed vehicle-dies. Tries it again-Wheel gets destroyed-vehicle explodes-dies. 10/10
3056	1	a	Just Great
3487	1	a	The little time i've had in ARMA III, really goes to show that this is a very heavy Milsim game, and is amazingly fun, highly realistic, with great and smoth controls that never get in the way. ARMA III fixed ARMA II's more clunky controls, and added different stances besides, standing, crouching and prone. This adds a new dynamic to the game, and allows for things like cover that would be useless at the standing, and still realvealing at crouching, you can 'Crouch-prone', or crouch very lowly, much lower then normal crouching, which makes combat more dynamic and much more fun. The only thing in ARMA that is a killer is stamina, because it its a milsim game, stamina will always be your number one enemy, and more of the threat in a fire fight then the guy shooting you, because you cannot steady your aim.
2071	1	a	Amazing game!  Amazing Mods!  Amazing Graphics!  rate this game 10/10!
5200	0	a	A great game from the start, and later dying. The community is filled with quiet people with little to no communication.
5134	0	a	11/10
3755	1	a	I really like Arma But Since they keep updating and the other game franchies are giving their DLC's for free. pretty much I think that they should eventually give the Apex out for people or at least make the Other DLc's such as Marksman, Karts, Helicopters free because the market on their prices on Apex is more then 20 bucks in my eyes. I think that it would be kinda awesome to see that the DLC's should come out free for owners that have had Arma 3 before there biggest update. If not then I would say that reduce the prices on the Steam Store. Sure the sales are nice, But it only goes down lower to 20 bucks, Which its way expensive for its DLC. Plus Since their Marksman, Helicopter and Karts. They should be free by now because Apex is pretty much the biggest DLC and most expensive. 30$ Bucks.
6	1	a	If you haven't heard of Age of Empires, then say hello to one of the most iconic RTS franchises. With the release of Age of Empires 2 HD Edition, there's quite a bit to go around for fans of the franchise. But enough about that, how is Age of Empire 3?  Well it really depends on what you're after. Visually, it's still pretty freaking gorgeous, and it holds up quite well, though it does show its age a bit (what do you expect for an 9 year old game). the lighting effects are great, and the smoke and particle effects, especially the destructible debris that falls of buildings is a nice visual treat, and I remember how amazing it looked back in 2005, and to me it still looks great.  In terms of gameplay, it feels more in line with Age of Mythology, Ensemble's previous entry, rather than Age of Empires. From the way you choose a leader each age (mirrors choosing minor deities in Age of Mythology) to general UI layout and control schemes, AoE3 feels much like a spiritual successor to Age of Mythology, with a focus on historics rather than mythos.   Though with this iteration of the series, there are new, much needed improvements. Gone is the need for a drop off point for your workers; like the Atlantean race in AoM:TT (Age of Mythology: The Titans), your workers only need to mine from the resource to generate that resource. This makes macromangement considerably less fiddly.   Another change is how Caravans work in AoE3; instead of building a market, creating some caravans, and sending them to a Town Centre, there are now neutral Trading Posts that need to capture, which provide a steady steam of either Wood, Gold, Food or Experience. There are other neutral buildings the map, such as native settlements, or saloons which give you access to new units.   But by far the biggest addition to the series is the Home City. The Home City has a deck of shipment cards which can be sent to you during the game, depending on how many levels you gain through experience (gained by fighting, find treasure, building or from aforementioned trade caravans). The shipments can range from dozens of cavalry soldiers, supplies of wood/gold/food, to permanent improvements to military, defense, economy and so on. It can change how you play, and it's an interesting additon to the game.  The singleplayer in the Complete Collection offers up plenty of content, with about 8 campaigns, ranging from 15th/16th Century colonials to Battle at Little Bighorn, to the Indian Revolution, and even a little bit in Japan during the Sengoku period. It has plenty of nicely realised characters, interesting stories for each campaign, and enough content for each campaign so they don't feel short. This along with the 14 civilizations you can play in singleplayer (and multiplayer, though there isnt much of a population) skirmishes means plenty of content for your money's worth.   If you're new to the Age of Empires franchise or if you enjoyed Age of Mythology, then Age of Empires 3 will be a fun ride through some events through history. If you preferred Age of Empires 2, then you might not like Age of Empires 3 quite as much. For me though, its a hearty recommendation.
4753	1	a	Not the best game in the world. And when they launched it; it didn't even feel finished. This Game is NOT worth $59.99 if you have arma 2, UNLESS you want better graphics or your a die hard Military Sim. Monkey. Now as for the sale's, which one is going on right now ( 2/24/2014 ); Its 40% off, that makes it about $35. BUY IT! This game has many diffrent mods just like arma 2, and if you dont have arma 2, DONT BUY IT! Get this; its $15 more. SO in all: Pros :  Better Graphics More In Dept For Military Sim Monkeys  Cons: Price Less Mods Higher PC Specs ( Expected ) Worst Graphics Than Arma 2 If You Run On Lowest.  Still Doesnt Feel Fully Finished.
1889	1	a	This i a great game!  first Altis life experience: -walked up to a castle -got taken hostage by a group of screaming rebels -got my kidney stolen from me -they dropped me on the street -I died  10/10
2074	1	a	It's okay i guess
3342	1	a	this game is great for those players who wants more than just running around shooting people in cod of battlefield. arma 3 is an extremely well made militairy simulator which gives you multiple choises of gamemodes and hours of intense firefights. you can go on multiplayer with you and your crew or go in a free for all deathmatch in Battle Royale.   personally arma 3 is my favorite game and definetly recommend people to try this out. the campaign has a really good story, solid multiplayer servers, a well made Editor to make your own missions.   it could use a few fixes on terrain(if you are far away from someone the map tends to glitch and show flying objects) and maybe a little improvement on animations but this game truly is one for the books.   Bohemia Interactive, Well Done :D
2103	1	a	ItÂ´s Ok!
2383	1	a	This game is better than watching an all-autistic soccer match.
1275	1	a	The most amazing, most realistic game ive seen in a war game. The community is mature and friendly its amazing. The kind of game you wont get bored of easily.  And the game that you would rage a lot for dieing but meh who gives XD. I recommend it. The kind of game that brought me back to gaming.  Keep up the good work.
3776	1	a	Great game, still trying to figure out some things about the game tho XD but great game
749	1	a	Awesome way better then arma 2 has Greatly improved should definitley pick up some time
3445	1	a	Not many games will amaze me, but this one did. I did not belive that Arma 3 would stand a chance to Arma 2/OA but it gives it a good run for its money. Only downside to Arma 3 is the lack of weapons and vehicles but mods seem to patch that right up, good job Bohimia Interactive
4558	1	a	There do not exist a better realistic tactical shooter out there. The mod support is also a bonus.
3257	1	a	Even though I could only play for a couple days it was a really good game.  9.5/10
3992	1	a	Arma 3 is not your typical first person shooter. It is a military simulation. It truely is one of, if not, the most immersive games I have ever played. The amount of tactical realism this game offers is like no other shooter out there. Arma 3 rewards the player for having good tactics, teamwork, and communication, over twitch reflexes like in other vanilla shooters. If you're a fan of anything military, or just like strategic, tactical gameplay, especially with friends, i would definately recommend this title.
325	1	a	9.5/10
1951	1	a	I spent about 30 minutes trying to figure out how to land a helo. I then ran to a bluefor FOB to group with a few allies. We proceed to move slowly around the FOB area for our objective. One of our guys, Cel, gets shot from somewhere inside a town. Proceed to call in air support to see if they can help us find the shooter. Air support cant see anything but we are sure Cel got shot form in the town.  Cel asks our squad leader if we should just arty the town. Squad leader gives the go ahead and we turn the little town into dust.  Best game ever
5308	1	a	The best realistic simulation shooter
4713	1	a	The Best
5146	0	a	Broken from the start. Horrible gunplay, often crashes, laggy â¥â¥â¥ multiplayer. The action menu alone is reason enough to not reccomend this game
2279	1	a	tl;dr: Better gameplay, controls, sound &amp; graphics then ArmA 2 however it has way less content atm.  ArmA 3 is better suited for those who want a more 'Casual' ArmA experience it's less of a simulator and more of a game this time and it shows with the greatly improved controls where it feels like you are playing a proper FPS and not a clunky simulator.  The first part of the singleplayer campaign is the only good ArmA campaign i have experienced and i did play all of the ArmA 2 campaigns so they did a good job there and i'm looking forward to the next part of the campaign.  Because of it's improved controls it's a lot more enjoyable to play it singleplayer then it was in previous games which means that you will have hundreds of hours of enjoyment just playing through all the singleplayer missions on the Steam Workshop.  Because of the modding contest there will hopefully be tons of content coming up soon and i'm looking forward to the near future of ArmA 3.  As to the multiplayer side of things there are already a ton of fun gamemodes and missions out there, however as always the best way to play ArmA is with a ArmA community playing on private servers.  Overall it's worth buying man just get it already.
5358	0	a	While I love the Arma series, this game was not was I was expecting. When you make a game, you have a couple things that need to be set up to make it a game.   1. A setting - They created the island, and it was good, very large and open with a diverse landscape  2. The Engine - Everything works well, even the physics, which Arma 2 completely failed at. Movements are fluid, you got way better animations, so there aren't any complaints....until  3. Weapons and Vehicles - This is one of the most crucial points to add variety to a game, and I am sad to say that BI failed miserably. They created virtually nothing for the game's release, for what reason I don't know, but it aggravates me to no end. You have all the things in place, the tools for people to make their own missions, but there is no variety, same guns, same ammo, and a couple of vehicles. Look at Arma 2, even without the DLC, there was TONS of content to work with, and the DLC just added onto that.   My advice? Keep up to date on the status of the game, and once the first DLC comes out, THEN buy it
191	1	a	Great game , do not listen to people with their 'pay to win' comments. This game is not made for that purpose. This game is made to be a military simulator. Not another variant of your standard bad CS/COD shooter games. Do you want military simulation ? This is what you should go for.
638	1	a	One of the best games i know!
479	1	a	Killed a cop, stole his car, got chased by 3 cars, died.  10/10 would do again
1779	1	a	Love the game, Super fun, also love Role-Playing  
502	1	a	Played a few hours. It's fun. 6969
636	1	a	0/10 mechanics  10/10 fun
4937	1	a	Uhh, what button do I click to send this review? 10/10 game, must buy
4824	1	a	arma 3 is a good game you should buy it unless you're a part of isis
3985	1	a	Ah the good ol' Arma III. Lets get started.  Arma, a mil-sim game by Bohemia, how is it played? Custom game modes. Yes, there's a campaign, yes you can do the mil-sim related tasks and wage war against other mil-sim players, but this game isn't typically played like that. Custom maps like: Altis Life, King of the Hill, Battle Royale Mod, etc are how most people end up playing and enjoying this game.  As of this writing I play this game, for the most part, once or twice a week, but as you can see I've logged hundreds of hours on this game. That should speak quite a bit in regards to the fun factor. Whether you want to Role-Play with other players (who 50/50 just shoot anyways), play a giant game of king of the hill with big guns and vehicles, or just play an hour long survival last man standing kind of game... Arma III offers it.  Downsides to this game, bugs, lots of them, expensive DLC, and one of the most poorly optimized games I've ever played. The game would greatly benefit from a way more optimized engine that doesn't tank a modern PC under 60FPS by just being in a town.   Once again, that said, you can spend hundreds of hours entertaining yourself in the world that is Arma and I do highly reccomend this game for all shooter fans.
3252	1	a	Great game, Very Good War Simulator also very fun to play with friends. 5/5
490	1	a	Recommended to anyone who canÂ´t stand CoD. Please stay away if you believe that DayZ made ARMA III possible. Anyone else - go get it!
2023	1	a	this is the most realistic game i've ever played
1295	1	a	Hard, and glitchy. Get the hand of it and you'll have fun. Remember, most Arma games aren't complete until about 2 years after release.
3455	1	a	9/10 Best Sandbox Simulation. Truly enchances the feel of FPS to send you to war. With huge amounts of mods to choose from, it makes it create a different feel no other game creates. Highly recommend this game.
733	1	a	Wow I've played 500+ hours on this game and I'm still not bored of it. The game throws you into the battlefield with no help at all, in fact it can be a little confusing at your first minutes of play. But once you dedicate yourself and learn the Art of War, you will soon be talking, what almost seems alien language, to others in your house.  From your usual mainstream happy-go-lucky Call of Duty or Battlefield, Arma 3 teaches you the realism of war by simulating... WAR. It will be frustrating, it will be dirty and it will rewarding!   You can either get into multiplayer (strategic and friendly for the best part), single player (which has a good campaign at the same time introducing you to what you will be heading into for the rest of the game) and editor (a huge sandbox where you can do anything and make anything such as missions, mods, and just mess around to get used to the gameplay and physics).  Absolutely love this game and totally recommend it for veterans and people who are interested in the whole military theme.
3668	1	a	Played most of my hours in Arma 3 Battle Royale and it has been an absolute blast. Took some time getting the fps stable enough, but that I can live with:) Tactical, adrealin pumping and realistic combat simulator!  
2557	1	a	for the ppl who are tired of cod and bf because this is 66x better than both of them if you have a good computer to run it. 10.5/10 amzinggg 
3075	1	a	So fun, and at time realistic. Mods for world war two, vietnam, RPG mods the content is unlimited! Best purchase I've made thus far!   10/10  
3362	1	a	From the perspective of a player that hasn't experienced the previous 2 ArmA's, this game is great! It's provided something that I've wanted for a long time; a sandbox, army based, mod-able, campaign! The graphics are lovely and customization is very vast. The DLC is actually worth it for once, and I cannot wait for more to come out!  Very Good game, Get it if you like combat!  - 10/10
4490	1	a	Roses are red Violets are blue I am a dog  10/10 'Would Takistan again ' -IGN  
4431	1	a	Flying tanks, aimbot AI and all rounded shenenigans and barrels of Charlie Chaplins everywhere. Get this game!  ROCKET GIVE ALPHER PLZ! à¼¼ ã¤ â_â à¼½ã¤ Give SA! Rocket Plz
2490	1	a	great game without bugs. 
577	1	a	Shot my friend in the back of the head and parachuted out of the helicopter he was flying as it crashed.  11/10
4376	0	a	The game is absolute garbage. I thought it would be fun, I guess not. Stick with Arma 2: Operation Arrow Head if you want better experience!
2302	1	a	AN EXTRAORDINARY GAMING EXPERIENCE! THE MOST 'MUST HAVE' GAME AT THE WHOLE STORE.
3962	0	a	I bought this game day 1 of steam release, it was pretty barebones stuff, a few guns, even less vehicles, 1/3 a campaign.  They said more weapons would come, (if you know arma 2, they had dozens of weapons, arma 3 however had less than 10)  well more weapons did come, in the form of paid DLC.  More vehicles, more paid DLC.  Scumbag moves
1692	1	a	Great game. Much wow. Many excite. 
2457	1	a	Really good game I give it a 10/10. After the heli dlc I havent been able to play it though it keeps crashing :( 0/10 
3461	1	a	Love it.
3147	1	a	Best simulator game. Like the combat beside the movement when you prone but the game and grapich is amazing.
2794	0	a	I pre-ordered arma 3 deluxe almost as soon as it was available, i was hyped for arma 3, and despite what my hours reflect (steam is weird with offline hours) i have played the crap out of this game; i want, no i NEED, to love this game, day 1 i convinced 3 of my friends to buy arma 3 so we could play co op together, and i'm regretting doing that.   The Game:  The game plays just how youâd expect from an arma game, some bugs, it's weird quirks like you can vault into a wall and kill yourself, despite walking 10 feet and laying idle for half an hour my trained military professional can't stop from shaking around like a heroin addict. Still, its arma and i enjoy the game, i would recommend it itâs really fun.   Unfortunately the one thing i was super excited for was under water combat, water infiltration etc, i was sooo hyped for it, and then i played the diving showcase, and i was miserably disappointed. First off, there's only 3 positions you can be in, standing straight up and down, on your back, or on your stomach, is there a guy directly above you you want to shoot? well that sucks, embrace your impending death. you can't move 360 in the water, which is just terrible, the underwater combat and movement is miserably disappointing. A massive, massive, massive let down.  Still, there's hope!!! who doesn't love helicopters in arma right? i'll just wait for it to be releasedâ¦ oh cool! just got a notification that helicopters have been released, let's just jump in a- wait what? i need a dlc? to fly a helicopter? well thatâs weird but okay, it's probably like 99 cents or 2 dollars nothing maj- 16 DOLLARS!!!!!!!!! WHAT!!!! okay, maybe it's justified, there's probably like at least 15-20 helicopters right? 2 helicopters, for 15 dollars? are you kidding me? what the hell is this, no discount for deluxe owners? so i payed all that money for a map and an easily stolen mp3 files, great.   alright, thereâs still one thing i like in arma, sniping! itâs so much fun to sniper in arma, we all know it, soon theyâll add sniper rifles and i'll be able to run around ghilling it up picking off opfor. alright! marksmen weapons added, 5 marksmen weapons added too!! sweet i was worried they would add one rifle at a time. letâs just load up a game and get sniping away, 16 DOLLARS AGAIN, ARE YOU KIDDING ME, 16 DOLLARS FOR 5 RIFLES 2 MACHINEGUNS AND A GHILLIE SUIT!!!!!!!!!!!  oh also they added a go kart dlc, which is really fun and worth the 2 dollars it costs, like all dlc for this game should but doesnât.  In conclusion, it could have been a great game, murdered by dlc preventing you from using things in the game, i canât wait for the bullet DLC to let you use Bullets. it would be different if it was something not crucial to game play, who wants to do a mission on a massive island without helicopters? who wants to stealth around or take out targets without marksmen rifles? go karts? yeah it's nice, cheap DLC, not crucial to game play. so so game mechanics, if you like arma you'll like it, disappointing diving, and be prepared to spend at least 32 dollars extra just to play the game. also thanks for charging us extra for trusting you and pre-ordering the game, if i had waited and bought the game now it would've cost me less. thanks.   oh yeah, and good luck getting more than 30 fps on your thousands of dollars in hardware, this game has about as much optimization was windows 10.
3906	1	a	Great game bro
4157	1	a	 Tested the game during the free week-end on 2014.26.10   I have played Arma 2 and I am a fanatic of realistic military/tactical simulations, like the first Ghost Recons, Rainbox Six, America's Army, Insurgency, etc.  Note that right now I am at the  Tipping Point  mission, and I only played single player.  BTW I cannot finish the mission since I cannot for the life of me get into the speeboat. I can drown under it though. I also completed the entire tutorial which was very well made. +1 for this.  However the first impression of this game ain't good:  The 'simulation' part is very lacking .   Simulation? Nah... for real?
1989	1	a	Found a guy in Breaking Point. Said he was friendly, had a helicopter. Went in a car. Hooked my car. Said quote' Where to' Then dropped me all of a sudden  Best Trolling gamer ever IGN- 50/10
1654	1	a	Great game plus mods
2214	1	a	Lots of hiding in one place as a tank circles you. 10/10 would sit in a room for 30min again 
1598	1	a	Great game you cant go wrong with this if you love millsims, and team play,
4030	1	a	I have heard many things about this game such as its poorly optimized or it's too laggy. Yes it is poorly optimized in some situations but when it comes to graphics, knowyour computer specs and dont argue when it lags because you bought the game without looking at your computer specs and noticing their bad. In my opinion this game is very fun. It is a very realistic game because crashing a car that your in will hurt you. Getting shot in the head will kill you. When sniping there is bullet drop. I love this game not only for its graphics, but mostly for the gameplay.    I will note that I reccomend having friends to play with on the game because it's not so fun alone. Well at least there are some nice people in the game, others willbe totlal douches as a teamate. I love to play gamemodes such as King of the Hill, Wasteland, and Battle Royal but not so much.    I will rate this game a 8.25/10 due to the lag even on low setting. Also if you have the settings too low for your computer, the game will lag, I can play this game at 50FPS on ultra settings.
3308	1	a	An amazing FPS, Action, Multiplayer game. With Sick Graphics!  ArmA 3, a game like no other, buy the game and experience Ground Combat, Air Combat, Artillery, and so much more! It also comes in with a group of Gamemodes, like Wasteland, Epoch Mod, Overpoch Mod, Altis Life, ArmA 3 Life, etc.  Buy this game! You won't regret it.  
3175	1	a	i Love This Game :-)
974	1	a	Great fun game that takes time to get good at but its worth the 59.99!
1442	1	a	Best military simulator I have ever played. Highly reccomend especially if your going to be playing wiht friends.
4335	1	a	If you enjoy a immersive experience you will enjoy arma 3. Whether you are traveling thew Nam hoping there is no one hiding in a bush or you are traveling threw altis hoping not to be robbed by a creeping terrorist. If its your forte you will be evading police in the city of lakeside transporting your thousands of pounds of meth back and forth from your lab to your drug dealer. There is a mod or server for every person who is apart of the PC master race.
2070	1	a	Arma 3 can and will be frustrating to start out with; rest asured it is amazing you just need to do the following:   1. Look up Dslyecxi's guides to Arma 3 - Particularly the movement and shooting guide:    https://youtu.be/G8vrbzNYEwM?list=PLQEd6zRLOafWtrQ4EAYKl6z23hvCLYgW6   This will give you an overview of how awesome movement can be in arma when you understand it.   2. Dont start in the campaign. At least dont get frustrated if you find the campaign hard to start with.   3. Instead I suggest going on a Domination server. Particularly if you find one that has infinite sprint. Most if not all will let you test out weapons and play on a team of other players against AI. You will quickly get a good feel of the teamwork in the game and you can ask players ingame if something isnt working for you. Most importantly if you are stuck far away you can respawn at a base and start again without the tediousness of walking simulator that Arma 3 can be.   4. When you get better branch out and try more hard core version of missions. There is hours and hours of fun here to find. You will eventually love walking simulator 2014 :)
244	1	a	Arma 3 is a great game but isn't as good as Arma 2 (In my opinon)  This game has lot's of bugs and glitches. Arma 3 looks good but it needs a great PC to run smoothly.  Sa-matras wasteland is amazing and I'd recommend it
1966	1	a	controls as complex as female minds
4778	0	a	poorly optimised piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ game, pretty good gameplay if you can get past the 10fps tho.
2757	1	a	This game is great and very realistic, but you definitely need to play this with friends and it has a definite learning curve.
3620	1	a	Laggy, buggy, de-sync. It has everyting that an Arma game needs. 10/10.
2262	1	a	this games cool except i cant get it f my life
2749	1	a	awesome game!!! .. even if you buy it just for the Breaking Point mod.. it is worth it!!!
1392	1	a	great game
2062	1	a	I'm warming up to it..
2935	1	a	This game reall suprised me I plan to buy it soon and get the Breaking point mod for it.
2105	1	a	Best Game ever! played it for so long! everybody should have it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2981	1	a	I haven't played it too much but I can safely say make some friends and make your friends get this. cause its hella more fun when you have a group to play with.
3721	1	a	Simply the best game ever - Only with mods. Without mods, it is still a great game.
1366	1	a	The community is trash, its a mix of team killing, autism, and milsim faglords making â¥â¥â¥â¥ overly complicated. As usual with arma games the optimization is absolute garbage and no matter what you do, you wont hit 60fps consisstantly in online. The guns feel great but have the impact of a pellet rifle, especially the 9mm sidearm NATO gets. The story doesnt make sence but its arma, you dont play it for the singleplayer (i was very disapointed however that the singleplayer was not co-op like in 2). The only way to make this game good is by A) Having a squad that fits you, whether it be autistic milsims, people who are just playing to â¥â¥â¥â¥ around, or a mixture of both, who is in your squad ultimatily deterimines your fun B) MODS MODS MODS MODS. The massive amount of weapon mods spices up the gameplay with familiar faces like the AR platform and ak platform rifles. It makes the game much more realistic ironicly. C) Having lots of patience. Good luck finding a server that is consitantly good that doesnt have faglord admins (Ive been banned for saying 'wat' isntead of 'what', asking someone to turn down their mic, and using opfor weapons while playing as blufor).  6/10, 8/10 with mods  Be advised, when you download mods, even if its something as small as a retexture, you will NOT be able to join 50% of the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing servers because arma doesnt like having us filthy modders join vanilla servers. So the servers will be split and you will be getting upset because of the lack of a filter between vanilla only and mod friendly servers.
2849	1	a	I love this game because it's the only one of its kind. I hate this game because it's the only one of its kind and I need to swallow all the terrible flaws this game has ;_; &lt;3 Thanks bohemia for making the best poorly designed master piece there is.  Pls write a new engine from scratch for the next installment with all that DZ and Arma monies you have so you'll actually know how everything in your engine works. You don't fool me, there is tons of files names .ofp or ofp2 (Operation Flashpoint, Operation Flashpoint 2 [Arma 2] )
5344	0	a	Not Fun &amp; setting up controls was almost enough stopping playing instantaneously
4381	1	a	  love the game such realism
1024	1	a	Arma 3 is a brilliant and well made game, It's the best war simulation game out there. The steam workshop mods make it even better.  Awsome game
1830	1	a	I have wasted many hours into Arma and its completely worth it Pros The fact that if you get bored of shooting you can play many mods for example arma 3 life one of the greatest possible roleplays ive seen in history  Another fact is that i never knew how much organ dealing could sell for now im a corrupt drug addict :)  Physics are fantastic but sometimes there â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ like all games Realism it is a simulation of war and its pretty close to war but to be honest you can never really get that close ever to actual war  Massive Variety of guns to choose from Cons Theres no Ak47 Rip One dlc is for a map thats barely a new game
4798	1	a	Awsome military/sim game for sandbox lovers! 
455	1	a	If realism and military, cooperative warfare is what you're looking for, look no further. ArmA 3 delievers the greatest expirience to date, and it even allows you to:  -Fight a futuristic force of ants -Single handedly fight terrorism in your underwear -Fight an overwhelming force of quickly populating bunnies -Watch a guy do a backflip from a headshot  And last but not least, customize your gun and character to take on any threat to the wonderful US nation with your squad, which may involve:  -Watching your friend get mowed down in front of you -Watching your friend get blown up from an APC -Be able to do tactical drive by's -And much, much more!
2792	1	a	This game is really fun to play with friends and yourself and a great shooter game.
4438	1	a	This is the dogs nads....
1214	1	a	Just play it.
3887	1	a	You thought Arma 2 was good?  In Arma 3 even the sound lags.  5/5FPS
4280	1	a	really good game !
3937	1	a	This game is extremely realistic, with everything bullet ballistics to in-depth squad command. And if you aren't satisfied, there's a massive community that's always creating addons, modifications, and even full-conversion modifcations. The community also has another side where you can find friends and formulate tactical squads or even battalions. I highly recommend you check this game out, though do acknowledge that this game isn't perfect and does lack a lot of desired features. However, you can probably find those features within the modding community.
4756	1	a	Played King Of the Hill Stole helicopter Everyone entered Helicopter i tried to fly helicopter  I crash helicopter into spawn Got abuse in chat  10/10 would get called â¥â¥â¥â¥ Pilot again.
127	1	a	No one said you have to fight a war with pants on. 10/10
3304	1	a	I really love this game. There is some glitches though not that much and is very fun to play with friends or teamamates. There are things like role-playing servers where you have to act just like you act in life and another is wasteland which is just trying tu survive. You need to find your stuff and survive, I really like this game and I could play it for days striaght without stopping because it's just so fun. Add me as a friend and we could play Arma 3 sometime , I am always on :)
4400	1	a	this game is the best army/war game i have Ever Played id say its better and more immersive then any other army/war game that i have seen. if you like atkeast 15hr of gameplay in a game that you can play with friends and team up with other players and fight other player this is a game for you there are rp servers and survival servers aswell and teamdeath match but i dont like that but none the less if you like spending hours in a game with friends roleplaying in games get this one because you wont regret it trust me I LOVE IT      oh yeah this is the longest review i have done
4481	1	a	The newest game in the Arma series from Bohemia Interactive offers a wide variety of new vehicles, weapons and gameplay options. If you like war-games, but want something a bit more realistic than 'CoD', Arma III is for you!
987	1	a	Arma 3 is one of the coolest free roam army shooter that I have played I have played it for 66 hours with only me and my two friend you don't need much friend for this game just one or two or three arma has lots of other game mode there is modes like Sandbox you can spawn items theres wasteland survive and found items like guns and cars so I give ArmA III a 7/10
2657	1	a	I have spent a good amount of time in this game, both singleplayer and multiplayer. And I have to say, this game can literally become any game you want. = Obviously, Arma 3 is built for epic tactical action gameplay. The base game involves around military atmosphere: tanks, attack jets, attack boats, armored cars, soldiers and helicopters; all of those can be accessed right away after you purchase the game and install it. = The game has many complicated systems and machanics, such as, commanding the AIs (it's a real pain in the butt), seats in vehicles, stances, movements, interaction menu, etc. This is why many new players feel disencouraged and quit playing the game. But if you are a tough gamer and able to deal with difficulties, then this game might be for you. = As I said earlier, you can experience this game in unlimited number of ways, with or without mods. Mods play a big role in the game, but I will say about that later. = Without mods, the player can still join several multiplayer servers, both PVP and PVE, which has different gamemodes too. But if you want to play singleplayer, this game can serves you well too. = Singleplayer in this game has 3 forms: campaign, scenarios, and editor. -Campaign is pretty much self-explainatory. You play as a soldier on the island with your fellow army teammates and go on an adventure with wide-open levels and a simple set of story. You can play the original Arma 3 base game's campaign or the ones you download from Steamworkshop (or others) which are user-created and some of them are really enjoyable to try out. -Scenarios are short Arma 3 missions that, usually, made by Arma 3 players and can be downloaded from the Steamworkshop (or other Arma 3 community websites) Some of them are really enjoyable like custom campaigns. -Editor is a very powerful tool in Arma 3. In this mode, you can create your own mission in any style you like. as long as you know how to do it. I suggest going through the Arma 3 editor guides and Arma 3 community websites to learn more about the editor. = MODS Mods are the wheels that keep this game running. There are countless of them and a lot of them can improve your overall experience in the game, some can change the game completely. For example, the mod 'Altis Life' is a multiplayer total conversion mod. It features the role-playing multiplayer experience, from normal civilians to police forces and outlaws. Therefore, even if you prefer a role-playing multiplayer game, you can play this game, just with mods. But if you are here to be a soldier on the battlefield fighting bad guys with fellow soldiers, you also have a lot of windows for modding. Weapon mods, vehicle mods, faction mods, etc. can be downloaded via Steamworkshop (and other websites) to add unlimited variety of reallistic content to the game. = MilSim MilSim stands for Military Simulation which, in the context of this game, is a style of gameplay that involves around serious and reallistic gameplay. Every player will act like a real life soldier and work together as a team. Usually, MilSim servers have mods to make the game more challenging and reallistic and admins of the servers or the head of the army will only pick players who are old enough and can play appropriately in their servers. So far, MilSim gameplay is the most accurate experience that Arma 3 is trying to offer to the players. = Thank you for reading the review. I have to manage all the mods and watch some editor tutorials.
497	1	a	It's like ARMA3 is your kid, it has it's flaws and constantly tests your patience. But you love it anyways.
5138	1	a	A fun arma game with better graphics, but it dosent have as many vehicles at the moment as arma 2
2667	1	a	In a lot of games I like the idea of teamplay and tactical combat. Usually though it's just fun and not functional. With just 18 hours played I can already tell that in this game that is not the case. Teamplay and command structures are necessary, and rewarding; I found myself giving medivac extraction, flying an A10, surviving solo in a harsh environment and so on.  The game does come with some of the problems inherent to the arma series, with some slightly off animations, and clunky controls (you get used to them). Of course if you're not a fan of hardcore shooters, this is no Call of Duty: it's not easy or forgiving, although there are a huge variety of gamemodes, with some harder than others.  Despite its problems the game is definitely worth buying, this is what I've been looking for for a long time.
1001	1	a	most realistic water ive seen
4251	1	a	Simply Best of its series so far.
5394	0	a	Wouldn't recommend, it's a broken game with lots of bugs in it.   Need to mod it up to make it look half decent.   
993	1	a	So within 5 minutes of playing the game I was approached by a player named 'Megatron' who offered me and my friend cocaine and $1,000.   While high on cocaine a masked man came up and killed my friend. Then some awesome medic in a helicopter revived him.  Shortly after someone kidnapped my friend and killed him while prenting to masterbate.  I'm hooked.
3762	1	a	it's a great game but it takes a beefy pc to run it somewhat smoothly, if I was to buy it again I would wait until the framerate issues get better than their current state.
1502	1	a	this game is the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing best so get it peeps 
1426	1	a	if you are looking for a REAL army simulator, then you're on the right place arma 3 is the best army simulator experience you ever wanted with a good story line and the freedom to choose to do everything you want, there are no straight checkpoints, you aint going to be shooting at a enemy for 2 hours one bullit could kill you depends on where you get shot.  this is straight away just the best militairy game ever made you have the freedom to do everything with the content creator.   the only question you should ask yourself is.. why did it took so long to have this game!!!   it's worth the money. especially with online multiplayer on a big map with the freedom to do anything with anyone.  see you in the battlefield!
1221	1	a	A game that mixes Graphics, Realism and a Millitary genre all into one. The game is very intense whether it be playing against bots or being taken hostage on your favourite RPG or 'Life' server.   The Editor mode is simply amazing with so much variety in it. You can make either a hostage situation or rise up against a city and take power for once and for all.  THe graphics in this game are simply amazing. Though, you must have a beasty computer to have Okay FPS. If you lower the settings it will be very harsh on your CPU but as the graphics go up the intensity on the gpu goes up. So that could really be improved on in the next Arma.  The DLC's are amazing. Helicopter, giving you a huge variety of helicopter of your choice to fly around the insanely large maps to conquer. Marksmen, be the best sniper in town and pick people off from hundreds of metres away. Karts, If you want to have a bit of fun and drive around in your mini go cars and mess around with people. Always a laugh... Tanoa, a Insane new jungle mape with improved helicopters and unmanned vehicles, oh and new kalashnikovs, what could be better. Though unfortunately the price, too high Bohemia!  The game is amazing with some aspects of the game being a let down.  Here are my ratings,  Graphics 8.5/10 Realism 9.5/10 Maps 8/10 Gameplay (Feel of the game) 8.5/10 Campaign 6/10 Editor 9/10 Guns 10/10 Sounds 10/10 Variety 8/10 Communication 10/10  Overall: 87.5 Great Game!
4006	1	a	Great Game
3482	1	a	The best military sim out there!
428	1	a	Simulator for those who have reasonable good computer, 10/10 Would still play
4339	1	a	)))
1223	1	a	Probably the best game ive ever played.....117 hours in the past 2 weeks.....nuff said.......
4263	1	a	I have now been playing ARMA3 for a few weeks or months (Time flies when you're having fun) and it is one of my favourite purchases on Steam. I had ARAM2 and AO (then modded Dayz), so i figured, Why the hell not.  For the past 5-10 years i have been more so a fan of multi-player gaming over single-player, thought i thought to myself, i will try this one single first, mainly due to the fact i wanted to know how smooth it ran. Graphics up pretty much full, played it and had an average framerate more than 30FPS, so all is good. I have a little play of single player and start to pick it up. Game looks great. Few Km of open sandbox.Can't complain.  I try joining a server. Stratis Wasteland. 70 players, smaller map then the main one. (19.3km or something i think). Spawn in and streight away i head some explosions and firing. Luckily enough on my first go online, i managed to take out the two guys firing and loot a vehicle. Nice rifle and a nightstalker scope. I just sat in a bush, my sights scimming around and taking out the odd players 1 by 1. Night time comes, Change scope to thermals. Beautiful. Hiding up a hill, sat in a bush, with a thermal scope and another 2 clips if ammo to use. I felt how sadistic i had become. Beautiful.  This was just wasteland mode. However there are many other modes. Altis RP i would say is the most populated. A role play island where a player will need to gain licenses, buy weapons, vehicles. Basically it's what GTA online would be like. I reccomend picking up some scenarios from the workshop, such as Whole lotta altis and whole lotta stratis. as we as some of the mission generators.  If you're amazing at CoD. Don't expect to be amazing at this. This is a real game and does require a lot of skill and thought. No running in expecting to kill 30 in a row.
1858	1	a	Realistic. so It's hard. But It's good.
4583	1	a	I don't even know where to begin with Arma 3.   Pro's: Realistic combat that really gets your heart pumping at time. Realistic scenarios complete with standing by to stand by while you wait for your commander. Fun that just makes you smile for hours and hours.  Con's: â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ framerates online regardless of your system. It simply doesnt matter what you run for a system. You will have poor frame rates if there are more than 20 people in your game. Desync detracts from a lot of the fun, however you can generally play through most of it.
2232	1	a	I can look around with my head.
1459	1	a	This is game for the real men!
941	1	a	Its a really amazing game, very realistic and a variety of different gametypes. I really recommend it!
2628	1	a	My hours in game alone should say enough.
1200	1	a	Military simulation at it's best, for a game. From bullet drop and distance to the vehicles and movment. Unfortutunately, not set in the cold war like arma 2 but, is definetly worth buying, espically with friends.
3256	1	a	This game for real man, not for kid
5176	0	a	I tried playing it sometime ago, not long though. Couldn't get a proper grasp on keyboard controls and found it to be difficult soley on that. Haven't put much effort into it since.
2946	1	a	The sheer scale of the maps. The roles its crazy though Villanlia is alright. Get a few mods installed and you can have alloooot of fun with it. This is the only Milsim game ik that does a milsim better, though their are alot buggs i heard at least i persoanly have only ran into cliping issues. But its pretty good at the end of the day.
84	1	a	With 70 hours, I can safely say this game is definetly worth the money. It caters to all types of players. Casual players can usually find themselves playing custom missions such as Wasteland and King of the Hill. Roleplaying players have Stratis and Altis life, and tactical players can find servers with Coop and Team vs Team missions as well as tactical groups that play the game in a very realistic manner. Besides the vanilla content there is a variety of realism and fun mods both in the workshop and from outside resources. Feel free to do your own research, check out the Zeus game mode, as well as some tactical gameplay videos that can usually be found  https://www.youtube.com/user/Dslyecxi .  tl;dr Game is awesome, very moddable, hours of gameplay.  Edit: Just to update the review, now with a lot more hours and proper tactical gaming experience behind me, I can say I rediscovered arma completely. In my first mission I didn't even fire the gun and it was more fun than most of the stuff I have played before. Now, this type of 'tactical' gameplay might not suit everyone so if you feel like it, give it a shot, if not, go back to the rest of the fun stuff.
3444	1	a	An amazing game, I recommend to only players who have patience and are skilled. This is not an easy game to play.
263	0	a	I gave this a shot over the free weekend and here's what I learned:   1. You need an incredibly modern and powerful gaming PC to run attractive graphics with this. My system is 5 years old, 570 GTX can barely run this at the lowest graphics settings possible, and that's barely getting 30 fps.   2. The amount of key mapping you need to do to make this even somewhat manageable as a 'game' is insane. Basically, you need one of those 7 or 9 button gaming Mice, because you won't have enough sensible keyboard key locations to cover all of the crap.   3. For a game where voice communication is extremely necessary, the voice comm functionality in this game is quite limited, but that's not really an issue because everyone is going to be using TS3 anyway...   4. Good luck finding a decent server to play on. Most of them are run by fascist bronys. Others are run by incompetent admins and you can count on getting spawnkilled by your own team over and over until you leave and find a different server. No, I'm not kidding.   5. The game isn't worth 60 dollars. The rest of the game (that's right, you don't actually get the whole game for 60 dollars, you need all of the DLC too because the only good weapons are locked) is going to run you even more. So it's over $100 game that isn't worth playing unless you have a $2,500 computer and a $120 mouse.   6. It seems like, if you met all of the requirements above, the game *could* be enjoyable. Just know what you are really getting yourself into...  
3633	1	a	Still the bomb.
2087	1	a	Great game, really love it highly recommend buying it 100%
4989	1	a	it is worth buying
1498	1	a	This game is 10/10 worth getting nothing will go to waste on this game. If you get board of some of the game types you get mods to play never ends.
4056	1	a	Its fun but not great, PVE vs AI you lose close combat(they shoot thru bushes ect) PVP working good if you have a good PC,you dominate the game Making your own map playing with friends for fun or adding some cool addons. 
997	1	a	I played just a bit, pretty good.
4607	1	a	a great game! if you can run it........
2859	1	a	Arma 3 is a well made next game in the Arma series with many options you can do. Now I played many different modes and mods that I should give you a decent review about this game.  Story  I do know that there are not many people that want to buy Arma 3 because of the story, but it still has one and isn\'t bad. It is a new story and does not have something to do with Arma 2 or else. The story starts with a mission for you and another soldier to help out another Camp, but on youÂ´re way there an invasion of the AFF starts over the hole Island and you and youÂ´re superior that is with you at that time try to get to a safe place to reform their allies. This getÂ´s harder than though because the AFF troops are anywhere but helpfully there were some units from the UK that helps out and you can regroup with them and so the story starts where you try to get connected to another safe Island and do many different tasks.  Gameplay   You can control land sea and air craft vehicles or go by you\'re own foot on the maps Stratis or Altis and many modded maps. There is not rally a task given to you by the game, besides the story, there are many different tasks given to you by community made co-op missions or PvP modes and also the complete different thing like a real life in modes like good known \'Altis Life\'. But besides Altis Life or other similar mods this is a military simulation game and give you many possibilities to let it feel like that. In co-op missions in a group of friends you need to make a briefing of the situation and make a plan or just go on patrol and get surprised by an attack of an opposite fraction and many more kind of situations. There are too many different gameplay methods given to you by the community that I can not listen them all up here.  Pros: -maybe one of the best military simulation games so far -many and sometimes comepletly different kind of gameplay methods -good graphics  -game gets upadatet by the developers to fix bugs and make the game just better -active community -Steam Achievements -you can use the terrain to your advantage  Neutral: -KI is okay as an enemy in co-op missions and is not completely stupid but also not perfect right now  Cons: -hard to remember all the keys for new beginners -many bugs(like falling trough some stairs and die or looking trough a wall) -the game has FPS problems like FPS drops   Conclusion: This game has many good things to offer and is one of the most realistic games so far (especially with mods), but it still needs to get patched and fix bugs. Arma 3 is a game you should buy because of the game play you will not have in any game I know right now and you get to live with the bugs and learn to avoid them as much as possible and if you have friends to play with this game can get you many hours of fun game play to get.  
920	1	a	This game is amazing. Its stupidly immersive, and you get right in to it. I highly recommend joining a group which fits anything you want. Want something casual, or light, there's a group out there for that. Want something realistic, milsim style? Group for that.  The amount of things this game can do is amazing, and worth the money if this is your style of game.
1757	1	a	Awesome game, hours of fun and never the same mission twice. 10/10
5079	0	a	Optimisation is absolutely terrible. Even if you meet and exceed the requirements, prepare for it never to exceed 20 fps.
2633	1	a	One of my favorite games of all time you can build bases play campaign multiplayer all that good stuff i recommend!
2349	1	a	Hours of Entertainment
465	1	a	This is the most solid simulator out there. The game is improved in countless ways since the previous title in the series. Name a game that can beat Arma in strategic military large-scale team play. None? I didn't think so.
268	1	a	The game is good . A great simulator of hostilities . Lots of possibilities. Good graphics . Good dynamics of the game. Sounds for 10 points. A kind of atmosphere is present when you play multiplayer with friends.
4728	1	a	This is a really good game but dont get me wrong when i say this but this game breaks quite a bit i dont really know if its just me but besides that the game is amazing so many things you can do in it.  10/10
3802	1	a	I do like this game, although it is hard for some computers to handle it is fun. I like it becuase of the Exile mod which is a survival mod, i love survival games so it fits right. I suggest this game to others try it out I bet you'll like it.
1293	1	a	I downloaded Breaking point, a basic Dayz mod for Arma 3 with the main maps and some other maps. If you like Dayz, and Arma itself too, buy it. I force fed a can of hotdogs to a stranger and killed someone with a brick. Like team survival games with objectives? Check out wasteland. Want to become a druglord? Try Altis life. Want to do realism? Arma has that too. Think of Arma 3 as a giant sand box game, that has everything you want, but still contains that military realism.
793	1	a	it's a awesome game it's lot's of fun 
518	1	a	ARMA 3 is a tactical based military simulator with many features. You can play alone or in a team, it's entirely up to you. There are many server's that allow various gamemodes - even custom gamemodes and modservers. The choice of many helo's and vehicles of any kind make ARMA 3 immersive and realistic. One of my favourite gamemodes is a roleplay based mode, called Altis Life. There are two main islands in ARMA 3: Altis and Stratis. The goal of Altis Life is making money and interacting with other players. You can also play as a cop or a medic and much more, depending on your taste.
5373	1	a	Great game, you will get your moneys worth
2917	1	a	The absolut biggest reason why i love ArmA 3 and i hope if they make a sequal of the game with this i will be thrilled. It's Zues. Using Zues is like an amazing sandbox and i really really hope if the make another ArmA game they have Zues in it. Other wise if they don't add zues to the following game, i will still continue playing ArmA 3 cause no game so far has beaten its amazing experince in the zues gameplay.
1361	1	a	This game continues to be one of my favorite games. If you are into survival/fps games this is well worth the try.
1142	1	a	This a MAJOR improvement of the last Arma game. Graphics are better and the physics. I wish the damage system was a bit updated but no matter, Its so much fun with 2 massive islands to explore :D Don't waste $$$ on MW or BF... get ARMA.  Lasting Appeal - 8.5 Graphics - 9.5 Sound - 10 Gameplay - 10 
4088	1	a	Love this game, firstly mechanics are wonderful! Graphics are amazing, and it is challening! First game I have played in a while where you can play and if you are new people help you out. I have put a lot of time into this game and some of the mods are amazing! But don't get me wrong. There are a few downsides. Sometimes can be hard to run if you have a not so good computer but overall I love it!   Love the bullet ballistics, simple and easy to learn. Love the teamwork involved in coop. People actually help eachother in stead of them running around with guns in their hands yelling'Allahu ackbar'. Brilliant community! Amazing mods!
4676	1	a	while playing i take off my clothes and carry bloody men around while they float like ghosts behind me like ghosts
5076	0	a	Fix your â¥â¥â¥â¥ing server browser.
3842	1	a	Only played for awhile but its pretty fun. 
492	1	a	Nice RPG game keep on the good work  
2937	1	a	I must say the Visuall update makes this game feel more alive and less dull! The colors pop out at you before it seemd alway like a gloomy day ! I think personnely there getting ready for the new map Tanoa wich is gonna make Arma 3 very very great! You do need Intel and Nvidia specs to play at good framerates and suggest you get nothing less then a Intel quad I5 3.5ghz and a GTX970 with SSD! higher specs would of course be better! But this is a tactical game meant to be played within squads! I suggets Wasteland or King of the Hill! Good luck !
2561	1	a	Best Game in my library, alot of people wont like this game cause it isnt easy like CoD or Battlefield, well they need to learn what strategy is and Skill and simulation. because this is top of the line!
1148	1	a	Best roleplaying game!
5345	0	a	Absolute garbage. Complete Alpha Crap. Buggy as all â¥â¥â¥. 2/10
2614	1	a	Looks fun...to bad I just played for a little bit
935	1	a	great game, i have had it since very early alpha and i have a total playtime of almost 700 hours. the game is great in itself and offers many different ways of play. mods are also great for the game (dont get too many as it ruins the game)  all dlc's are great and the game is a close to real (basically the most real game avalible) and it covers a range of factions and teams (military,civvilian etc.....)  i really reccoment this game to all !!!!!
5110	0	a	I only enjoyed the campaign. It's a great realistic military simulation game but people in the multiplayers are not cooperative. Play it if you want to try campaign and co-op. I Do recommend this game.
5350	0	a	Arma 3 is easy to explain. Imagine arma 2. Now add proper stances to it, ALOT better performance, alot of fixed bugs (alot more introduced aswell) and on and on. Arma 3 is a good game for what it is. The main problem is: the devs are â¥â¥â¥â¥ing lazy, they didn't bother modelling lots of civillian cars like in arma 2, instead, 4 or 5 that just have different skins. About 1 tank per faction. 3 or 4 Helicopters and â¥â¥â¥â¥ me, only one â¥â¥â¥â¥ing jet. I mean thats â¥â¥â¥â¥ing lazy. The amount of content in arma 3 is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing embarrasing compared to the shear amount of content in arma 2. Bohemia Interactive have done a great job with all the new content etc. but this game should still either be in alpha, or very early beta. NOT a finished game. Overall if your reading this to see weather you wanna get this game or not, its down to you. If you want a game that runs and plays really well, if you can look past the laziness of the devs and the lack of assets, then get it. If you can't however, just stick with arma 2 until the devs actually do something about the lack of assets etc. Again, this game should be in late alpha - early beta. NOT a finished game.
4295	1	a	Absolutley Brilliant Game!
5323	1	a	Great gameplay, great visuals, sounds, and the two new islands are frankly wonderful and huge. In my opinion the most noticeable improvement since Arma 2 is that we are now evolving into some realistic and visually credible open world, as opposed to the narrow places kinda looking like more or less similar 'checkpoints' in previous games. The gameplay adjusts extremely well to the new terrains, making Arma 3 something closer to an actual simulation than 'just' an advanced FPS with 'milsim' elements into it. However, it is impossible to talk honestly about Arma 3 without telling what hurts most: the lack of vehicles (planes notably, but not only), the lack of weapons and few annoying Ai pathfinding issues (sometimes even on places where all should normally go well).  That being said, I personally can see an insanely great potential behind Arma 3, and the way it will continue to evolve will in my opinion probably make it simply one of the best game ever created. All it needs is some more time to grow up.
1992	1	a	It's ok
4978	1	a	Love this game with a passion, there's so many things you can do and I've spent nearly 1K hours on it with both my accounts together I can highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys open world roleplay or playing tactical
2588	1	a	i shoot stuff 10/10 
1730	1	a	GET IT
4675	1	a	This is a very immersive game, with high attention to detail and a seemingly limitless amout of possibilities. Every peice of your gear is changeable... i mean sh*t you can run around the battlefield in nothing but your underwear and a t-shirt if you so please. You can change your camo and helmet and LBV and backpack and every other thing you carry. Everything that is in your inventory can be dropped or moved from bag to LBV or pants/ shirt pockets(and vice-versa). It provides a very similar experience to hardcore milsim airsoft (if thats what you're into... I am into airsoft) without the 'Hey call your hits' or 'Hey are you dead' BS. You are even able to create your own missions somewhat easily with the in-game mission editor. Anyway I figured I'd share one of my most memorable experiences in any operation in Arma- or any game out there.    I was playing on a mission that I created on Stratis(One of the in game maps). I was leading a 10 man assault on Air Station Mike 26. We were all riding in an APC. My gunner was doing great taking out ground troops, and even took out an Ifrit or two. Out of nowhere an enemy hit the APC we were in, popping all left side tires, stoping it dead in its tracks. I immidiately got out and threw a smoke grenade to either side and told my men to disembark. Unfortunately only 2 men made it out before the APC exploded. In that same explosion the 2 men that had made it out were killed. worried, I threw one more smoke grenade and waited for the smoke plume to build and ran straight back behind a small hill, dodging what seemed like the bullets from 1000 angry hostiles. Once behind the hill I healed my self, and radioed in for a helicopter extraction. I waited and waited until the heli showed up. All I could hear above me were the screams of the miniguns that the 2 door gunners were operating, and the swooping of the rotor. The heli flew right over my head and began to circle around the base, taking out enemy after enemy. I knew the helicopter would not last long, as it was simply a helicopter meant for extraction, and not any sort of combat, so I called in an attack heli for some added assistance. After the attack heli started to engage targets I sprinted inside the base behind a large H-barrier. I could see lots of enemies. I quickly engaged one enemy and started to advance to another H-barrier when I was hit. I quickly went prone and healed up, and threw my last smoke grenade inside the base. After about 10 seconds of letting the smoke build I ran up to a building and began to take out target after target, in some sort of spec ops manner(Yeah I was that good). I ran around the base with the supressive fire of the helicopters and cleared the entire base of any threat. After I called in the evac heli and flew myself back to base because the pilot was killed on landing because my area clearing is garbage. It was quite the experience to get the juices flowing.    This game never fails to impress, and I still find myself learning new things about it every day.
1554	1	a	Difficult to master but awesome to play. Realistic army sim.
747	1	a	what a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game xD
635	1	a	Is this DayZ?
4765	1	a	Found a chance to try RP. Bought a car and equipment before a crew bumped to my car. They stole my equipments and my clothes also my car. I've said them I need to find my kid. They said we will help. They took me a place where they stole your kidney. They stole my kidney and literally gave it to my hand. Then they took it back and put a bullet in my head.   10/10 Would take my kidney on my hand again.
940	1	a	Nothing is more glorious than helping lead a small army of gamers through clearing a city. Posting up and covering their advance with a suppressed sniper rifle, or using Artillery and coordinated attacks to level entire blocks before your comrades advance on the target.  I play Vanilla though, and honestly haven't been able to find any good populated servers running that.  Most servers you'll find are Altis Life, Epoch or the like. If this is cool with you, and you can take the fact that unless your PC is worth 2K$ you wont get anything above 34FPS, then I'd say its worth getting this game.
1006	1	a	This game is so good I love to play Simulations especially Military simulators. I might not have alot of hours of ingame time now but im going to be playing this game untill it gets boring.(Which it Doesn't)
386	0	a	If you like games with crappy controls, bad gameplay, and no incentive to do anything then this is the game for you. I played for a few hours and 50% of my time was spent walking around the woods getting blown up by random mines that I could not find or avoid. It seemed like any direction I walked in I would just explode. And when i managed to get past that AI that were out of my guns range just took potshots at me till i died. And to top it all off the game mechanics are only briefly explained, and not very well.  I will never play this game again. I play games to relax and have fun, not to die 50 times just to walk to an objective. Bottom line is if you want to play a fun entertaining game this is not for you, but if your really into playing for 5 hours to just to walk to meet up with people by all means this game will be in your top 10.
1193	1	a	a game where walls are just for show and you can walk right through em,A game where ifrits are unbreakable no matter the height, a game where you can fuken get thrown out of a c130 and ram into the ground and live Great game
628	1	a	get the game on sale.
5332	0	a	I'm going to be short on this one. The game is great, not a little, it is really great. But, I am giving it a negative review for I cannot play it properly for a very simple reason: I cannot stand its gunshot sounds. I am not whining over this, the thing is that I have an ear sensibility and I cannot stand high pitched sounds, period. For me, Arma 2 sounds are totally fine, I know that people in general gave Arma 2 sounds a bad rating, for me they are ok. There are other people over the internet who complain over this gunshot sound issue, they are simply too loud. I know that in real life they sound exactly how they sound in Arma 3 but, in real life, one also wears headphones to muffle the real gunshot sound, so, no, I do not need real gunshot sound in a game (considering that I use headphones for playing), I care for my ear health. I sent a support ticket to Bohemia: maybe they can add a slider for gunshot sound, maybe they can add an option to disable this very high sound dynamic range, I don't know if they can/want to do this. I was on the verge of buying the Apex expansion but I stopped because of this issue. If they don't do anything then, unfortunately, I have to stay with Arma 2 or other arcade shooters, what can I do. I am really looking forward for the devs to come up with a solution for this issue. If they do then I will change this review.
3625	1	a	If you like the smell of VDM and couple of baldies this is the game for you. :standingchicken:
1337	1	a	awesome game if played with Friends
49	1	a	Civ games seem so slow and boring compared to this game 10/10.
4451	1	a	This game is epic, if you're a Battlefield or COD troll then I suggest you move on to something like SiMS. Don't waste your time on campaign mode, get yourself onto multiple player, find a clan, get on TS, and trust me you wont look back.   See you on the battlefield â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥es
3587	1	a	Without a doubt Arma 3 is worth all the money if not more. I've had my some of best memories in gaming playing this game. There's so much variety in the amount of things you can do. Get bored of Altis Life? Then hop on KoTH. End up being bored with that later too? Well don't worry because Arma is jam packed with tons of content and different game modes to suit your needs. Just to name off a few of the other awesome game modes there's Exile, Domination, Wasteland, Breaking Point, Battle Royale, RPG/Life, etc. And then there's also the in-game editor and scenerarios. Whenever someone asks me if they should buy Arma 3, I always tell them, 'A pc without Arma 3, is like a human without a soul.' Though I would suggest having a mid/high tier build if you're planning to get into Arma 3. It's pretty unoptimized on weaker machines.  Yes you should definetly buy Arma 3, even if you aren't into shooters I'm sure you can find some enjoyment with this game.
3924	1	a	Absolute fantastic game. Very good simulation and good physics. Big open maps for dramatic scenery.
1683	1	a	Think if Skyrim and Battlefield had a baby and then it started doing meth.
4815	1	a	Great game with the Breaking Point Zambies Mod :)!  You need a good PC to run it good though xD
5082	1	a	Really enjoy this game  i like to play altis life but this game need a verygood PC but i still love it 10/10 recommend to buy if u rich
471	1	a	There is NOTHING, I mean NOTHING like ARMA. This is really and 'endless' game. The mod community is robust and VERY active. Everything, and ANYTHING is possible in ARMA III. This is what PC gaming is all about! Watch this video for a better example.    
1059	1	a	Very good game once you learn it! So many gamemodes to try!
5140	0	a	Can't play with my brother if play in same network. Kuyyyyyyyy!!!.
4926	1	a	For the little I played, this is definitive game for military simulation lovers.   It has some bugs, but the game is great and offers TONS of customizations and options to make it your own. A word of advice: You will never learn what is to play Arma if you are alone. So get an unit, soldier!  10/10
4341	1	a	Best Game ever. If you're looking for a realistic shooter come here.
4015	1	a	I love it.
5387	1	a	love the game would like a dynamic campaign to be included
936	1	a	One of the best games i've ever played and certainly the best military simulator that i have ever played. Astonishing graphics (especially with SweetFX), enourmous map, awesome workshop submissions and a very civilized and friendly community that will help you get started with the mil-sim as well as all the other game/mission types.
823	1	a	This game is really quite good. It wholly deserves the 60 dollar price in my opinion, and that is true to form. There has been a huge amount of work put into the game. Its scale and the seriousness with which it was handled by its developers absolutely deserves them the full 60 dollars. This game puts even next gen games to the test. It is fantastic. I will relay some of my experiences with the game:  Personally I am a HUGE fan of the lighting in the game. The dark is really dark, and the light is really light. The light is in fact just beautiful. There is nothing like driving in the night with your headlights on, and stopping somewhere with the light of your headlights to work by. Or moving through the dark in the morning, with a flashlight and a lighthouse far above you to keep things clear. Even tracers are quite well done, and you will constantly be taken aback by the absolute beauty and accuracy of both the lighting and the environment.  On to the environment. The environment is enormous. Hills, plains, farmland, valleys. It is all very well designed and is covered by very accurate and realistic looking flora which all server the purpose of providing some very useful and much needed cover. The scale of things is just huge, and is enough to blow ones mind. It is really something, standing on a hill 1 km away from an enemy platoon on the face of another and exchanging fire. That is what battle is, and that is really the scale that stands true to the test as what Arma is really about.  The vehicles are also a great part of the game, they are all EXTREMELY meticulously designed, and appear to be very much the real thing. In some ways, different, but you will not mind your long commutes via chopper or land solely because of the eye candy that is your ride.  The gunfire is a bit disappointing, however. Firing ones gun is not as much a pleasure as it may be in other games. It does not convey the same detail or intricate beauty that other parts of the game do, and does not feel nearly so powerful. I am not sure as to why this might be, but the guns are just so... light. I would like to see some more impressively realistic muzzle flare and gun interaction.  Additionally, the AI in the game is very flawed and can certainly leave one disappointed, especially during showcase missions. When I would like to play with a fully interactive AI, I meet soldiers who are completely unresponsive, downright born with autism and having a heart attack, or are just altogether far too quick to respond and accurate, just like a robot. The AI opponents often leave one shaking their head at the huge holes in interactability, especially on missions where otherwise this would be the focus of the game.  In total, however, the game is huge. If you are interested in the sort of fully fledged MILSIM combat that this game has to offer, please get it. I assure you that there is nothing else like this out there, and this is a game of its own. The creators had a mission, and that mission was achieved. Be responsible when you are flying your intricately designed helicopters or blazing tracer rounds at enemy soldiers down the ravine. Its fun stuff, and you never know where that may lead.
5205	1	a	It's a simulator on modern combat. You hardcore or not?
4567	1	a	Arma for life
562	1	a	10/10, its bretty gud. MP is still broken performance wise on gamemodes like invade&amp;annex (AKA domination)
4902	1	a	This is 1 of the best games i ever played, its so realistisc and evrything whit it is good!
3262	1	a	Hmm.. What can i say about ArmA 3? I mean.. i can't describe it because of its awesome epicnessÂ³. Just buy it and u will never play another game ;)
3312	1	a	Awesome Game! Breaking Point is a great MOD for the game as well! Well worth your time and money!
286	1	a	 If you are looking for a shooter equal to Call of Duty or Battlefield, you have definitely come to the wrong place. This game is not about kills and superior aim - it's all about tactics and coordination.
1849	1	a	my pc cant run it vary well as of right now but spend 3-4k on it &amp; the $60 to buy the game and it is worth it unles u donot like good graficks and a good fps then spend $700 on a crappy pc and go kill ur eyes so that they hav 3 fps cause thats how muthc a reguler at the min requiermints pc will give u i think cause i have 1 that gives me 15 fps and iv herd that they will go lower evon if u have no ai in on the vr do not buy this game if u dontknow what ur specks are. so check ur specks befor u buy this game it was almost a waste of $ to buy this game but ther is 1 pluse if u get a pc that hase the same specks as mine u will get beter fps on arma than on bf4 but be warned if u through any smok gronads they will kill ur fps  So i hop that this was helpfol  sry for the typing errors i dont know how to sell i did not pay atention in english class to mutch stuf to lern thats why its not spelled vary well 
4513	1	a	Lol xD Rawr Did it for the Badge: But still a really good game. Would recommend
514	1	a	If you are looking for a shooter game, look no further. This game will challenge you, embrace you, and entertain you for years to come. The detail, the immersement, the feelings you get when playing this game is unlike any other game out there.  You have to play it... Once you do, there won't be any other shooter that will be on par with Arma 3.
4139	1	a	Great game i just dont like the fact that bans carry over from game to game.
1675	1	a	If you are looking for a tictical military simulation get arma 3
4935	1	a	  This is a good GAME!!!
1262	1	a	Great it's supposed to be a ''simulator'' and that word kinda means boring this is gonna be so hard ect. Nope this is realistc game that does take too much skill well depends on what you do but it VERY FUN! you should get this â¥â¥â¥â¥
120	1	a	This game has potential and the tools for an amazing experience. I've had hundreds of unforgettable events playing this game with a group of people. Even after almost 1800 hours i still find this game very exciting. But your experience is truly dependent on the creativity of the mission creator and the people you play with..  If you're willing to make effort finding a good group to play this game with you will certainly have an astounding experience.  However some things you need to take in factor:  You will need a need a rather good computer, especially a good CPU to run this game smoothly.  Having a headset, or a seperate microphone is essential for communication.  It may be difficult to find the right group for you, keep searching.  Arma 3 Squads  [forums.bistudio.com]   This is not an easy game to get into, there are complex functions you may have never seen before. It will take you hundreds hours to master this game.  This game is aimed towards a more mature crowd than your average shooter.  This is a very mod friendly game, and some you may find difficult, but thankly we have things like steam workshop to make stuff more simple.  Lastly, i just want to mention big appreciation to Bohemia Interactive for constantly improving this game, and to the group i play with  Task Force Crusader  for the astounding experiences.  10/10 Make ArmA not War.
4782	1	a	This game is a lot of fun, especially with friends. Once you get tired of Arma 3 you can download the mods - Breaking Point, Battle Royale and others make this an epic title. This game has â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ my wife off because I play it so much!  10/10 Would â¥â¥â¥â¥ my wife off again.
3118	1	a	One of the all time greatest military sims. Arma 3 is a game for you that are tierd of short matches, on maps where you can snipe another player from the other side, and kids raging. The game gives you the possibility to try out many sorts of warfare from squad leader to tank commander.  The one thing Arma 3 lacks is a propper physics engine, tanks are not supposed to do sommersaults!  Other then that I whould recommend Arma 3 to anyone that wishes for big maps and loads of diffrent gear. Buy the Apex Edition! ;)
2011	1	a	This game is truly great. If you want a no â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t FPS shooter, no 360 headshots or rage. I highly recommend this game. Now there is some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t suchs as phsyics and how vehicels work over terrain. But I have never ran into any â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t during a firefight or trying to execute some missions. If you want to play a game that will waste your time, and be pretty at the same time. Get this, its almost like a virtual girlfriend.
2600	1	a	Amazing game, great community. It can be modded easily allowing wide access to user-made content.   DLC isn't mandatory unlike a lot of games, and there is frequent free updates adding new features.  Well worth the money that it's being sold for.
1084	1	a	Fantastic game, from casual to hardcore sim this game can and will fit your needs in a game.  Only thing i dislike about the game is the price of the DLC
2474	1	a	If you plan to have any free time after buying Arma 3, forget it, way too addictive. Brilliant Game. Many hours spent so far, many more to come....Highly recommend this game 11/10
3015	1	a	Absolutely fantastic military simulator!
233	1	a	10/10 just for the new sounds alone. this game just gets better and better.
238	1	a	if you re looking for style, this is the right game for you. Excellent bullet balistic, realistic gameplay and also customer friendly company :)
1002	1	a	There is something in Arma 3 which will suit your skils, not everyones the same (you will know this if you ever played A2 operration arrowhead) this skill or friendship you have gained by joining group/randomly meeting online will keep you coming back and you will never regret buying this game (unless your an 8 year old FPS swag i know bloody everything cos i play cod â¥â¥â¥)
3947	1	a	ArmA 3 is an excellent military sandbox, You don't buy it for the Singleplayer. You buy it for the Community mods and addons. You could really never run out of things to try or play.
4789	1	a	Mah hours dawg, need I say more...
608	1	a	Great Game
1038	1	a	A Game Within A Game FOR SURE. So Much You Can Do! Best Simulation! Altis Life Is VERY Fun. Excellent Game! :D
4330	0	a	Arma 3 is an awesome game! Players are young self serving short fused millenials but its still A must buy! but dont speak your mind on chat or you will be phantomly banned by men with no boezack to tell you there thoughts b4 doing so. there will be 5000000000000 servers but only 3 to join since latency sucks and everyone is a sheeple and plays some life role play mod garbage. i have 25mb a sec consistant download speeds and run it on minimal settings so internet and graphics is not the issue. so be wary of the bans is all i can say since there is no forgive policy on any server that i know. Dont be as mad as i am right now when ur banned for not installing some garbage communication software the admins want you to download from 3rd party insecure site! or for not lining up with the rest of the tools with no life on 1 of you 3 possible servers your able to play the vannilla game in! Happy Gaming :)
1061	1	a	I love this game ^_^
1948	1	a	For me personally, the best game I ever bought!!! Got it all, graphics, action, gameplay, teamwork, making new Arma buddies.... 
3886	1	a	No word to say.
4266	1	a	I dont even own this game 22/10 its okay :IGN
4032	1	a	Best, and most modular game I've ever played. I've never been so addicted to any game, this much
3151	1	a	Its a great game but you do need someone to teach you the basics because its pretty complex. The only major bad thing is when you shoot at someone and they die its very awkward, if you dont know what i mean watch some youtube videos about arma 3 and watch people die awkwardly
558	1	a	Kicked off the game [Battle-Eye Client Not Responding]
41	1	a	bought it for nostalgia reasons and you know what? NO REGRETS THIS GAME IS AS EPIC AND FUN AS IT USED TO BE!
4515	1	a	highly reccamend
31	1	a	A follow up to the 2'nd Age of Empires that everyone loved.   Among many this game is not so good, some things were simplified, such as gathering resources - now there are 3 instead of 4 of them and your villagers don't have to come back to the lumberjack or the city centre to store them.  Many smaller tweaks and adjustments, and of course a heavy focus on musket fights, artillery and the transition from Renaissance to the Industrial Revolution and father away into the 19'th Century.   It's a shame that there weren't any additional elements added to the Steam release of the game.  Controls being one of the more touchy ones. For instance, to change the hotkeys you need to manually go through each tab. There is also no Steam Cloud, but they did add Trading Cards so that's one interesting thing to look forward to.  This game is soon to have 10 years after it's release. But this edition is by far the best one yet. You get all the expansions. Working multiplayer with a community that still lives. And of course that same old strategy many remember and honor as 'one of the best'.   The modest presentation of it's ancestors passed away. I'd say that the magnificence of the soundtrack itself says a lot:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EWfMfHlFck&amp;list=PL37F10A7ECDC81CA0&amp;index=9   A Musical score composed by Ensemble Studios musicians Stephen Rippy and Kevin McMullan.   If History is of any interest to you, if the New World conquests were something you're keen on. Buy this game, especially when on sale!
4201	1	a	Was playing battle royale and as the plane crashed into a city everyone screamed allahu akbar and other racist terrorist â¥â¥â¥â¥.   â¥â¥â¥â¥ing amazing
3266	1	a	Gameplay if fantastic, maps are fantastic, missions are fantastic, wasteland is fantastic, mods are fantastic, rp life sucks.    8.5/10
667	1	a	I don't own this game but it lets me review it.
1149	1	a	Best Game I have ever played! the game is great but there is a slight problem with lag issues but other than that this game is spectaculer when you play with friends. I recommend this to anyone who has a good computer and is looking to buy this game!
5163	1	a	Awsome Game! Worth buying! :D
1914	1	a	Pretty good game for the most part. I have learned alot of with this game, i've created alot of unique content and met alot of nice people!
1365	1	a	as long as you have a good pc that can run the game well you are going to have lots of fun
5197	0	a	waste of â¥â¥â¥â¥ing money
526	1	a	Arma 3 is the Best Game :D
3800	1	a	Its 10/10 to be honest. I rate it.   10/10 should download
5255	0	a	I was half way into a mission. Driving a truck. I was told to stop at a check point. I don't know how to stop, so I hit the 'S' key. Apparently that's reverse. I was still moving forward, but the INSTANT I hit the S key, the truck changed from going forward to going backwards about a foot, which defies physics a bit, and it said I failed the mission for failing to follow orders (I guess going backwards 1 foot instead of 'stopping' at checkpoint). Have to start the whole mission over. Not sure if I'll play the game anymore.
4945	1	a	 My experience with the game     over 1350 hours    mainly played with realism units    have spent a lot of time mission making and modding    Positives
3575	1	a	Great Simulator IF you have Oculus Rift Recomend game Great
1030	1	a	Most hardcore FPS game ever
3867	1	a	Most realistic war / military game ever. The game is very easy to mod and the community has ended up making some very fun gamemodes and a variety of mods. Some of my favorite custom gamemodes are 'Altis Life' and 'King of the Hill'. This game also has a ton of realism units / milsim units that do custom missions. Even though this game has been out for three years, it is still being worked on with new updates, maps, etc. The map 'Tanoa' is expected to come out sometime this year, and they just released the 'Eden 3D Editor' a couple days ago.   Overall this game is amazing. With the surplus of mods and gamemodes this game never gets old. If you are interested in buying this game you will need a good computer to run it. Some servers have custom veichles and other things that drops your FPS low. Also, this isn't like most games where you can just go play for 15 or 30 minutes. For gamemodes like 'Altis Life', I usually set aside 3-5 hours to play. But I'd give this game a 10/10 for the realism, and the easy access to mods.
4010	1	a	amazing game full of epic mods worth every penny just buy it lol.
1677	1	a	it took a dump in my mouth
3763	1	a	The PC Experience 10/10 
2865	1	a	Noice Game
4392	1	a	Arma 3 tons of mods, good servers, great campaign THis is War!
357	1	a	Now that it is out of Alpha, it had been a very pleasant experience for me. 9/10
1862	1	a	its the gift that just keeps giving
692	1	a	If you want an arcade game, get COD.  If you want a war game, get BF4  If you want to feel like you're there, get ARMA 3
227	1	a	-joins wasteland -team kill  -he reports me -i have to say sorry if not i will get ban -dont know how to talk in game -get 4 days ban 10/10
3637	1	a	If you have some interest in simulated military gameplay and some friends, go for it. Alternatively you can check out some of the great mods like Altis life, Battle royale or Exile.
3920	1	a	Great game you wil have countless hours of fun just with the regular arma 3. Getting bored? Thats fine just jump on a multiplayer server like altis life and you will be able to get many more hours of fun! just make sure your pc can handle it.
254	1	a	When I first got it, I was disappointed. But after discovering the vast amount of mods and customization with the editor, I haven't stopped playing. 9.5/10
4027	1	a	Very strategic and requires skill more than anything. 
1884	1	a	U know its fun i guess if u like having fun then not so fun but ya i like killing myself slowly and painfully so this game is great for the pain
3349	1	a	Remember folks, suppressing fire does not suppress.  10/10 would suppress again.
3426	1	a	Pew pew, boom, argl.  11/10.
4151	0	a	I could not recommend this game even if I wanted to. Download is horrible, way too many gigs of space used for a game that is pretty choppy, decent graphics, and just a mess over all. The tutorial is fair enough, and the prologue is fine. But the campaign is horribly tedious and that's if you don't keep dying at it and having to respawn from autosave because they don't allow you to save for yourself after a certain point. Be prepared to die so many times your fingers will feel it. I'm glad to not be buying this and uninstalling it after I finish typing.
2737	1	a	Made me learn to play with 30 fps. Great game, totally worth it still if it has low FPS. On singleplayer i get 90+ fps on high settings 1080P. Probaly the server's issue or the dedicated server file which bohemia gives to the community. Hope it gets improved in the future
2641	1	a	I probably spend more time finding and downloading mods than playing.
3506	1	a	Very much enjoyed this game!!! So many servers to play that are all unique and enjoyable as the rest!!! I would happily give this game a 10/10 with no hesitation or doubt 
2624	1	a	Arma 3 is a very intense and beautiful game. If you've ever played arma 1 or arma 2 you would know that it is a huge game, from its single player campaigns to multiplayer modes and the community with their custom missions, scripts and mods. This game offers the player a good fountadion to a war-sim game, especially if you're playing with people and even better with a clan. All u can say is if you like war games and into simulators you'll definatly like Arma!
1855	1	a	One of my all time favorites. Tons of playability. Tons of mods and community content.  I would add more vehicles to the main game. More civ cars, and more common military transports like humvees. Maybe some more buildings as well.  Will keep playing until ARMA 4.
4355	1	a	Awesome multiplayer action. This team-work based game is incredibly immersive and makes you feel like a real soldier. With tons of weapons and vehicles to use and take out your enemy, this game is definitely worth the money. It's like Arma 2 but less buggy and so much more enjoyable!
2286	1	a	By far the best War simulator out there. It's just as realistic as you make it.  What steals the show is the landscape, beautiful mountains and villages make for a nice scenery to battle in.  Giving it a 9/10
992	1	a	great game
3745	1	a	Good game needs some performace working thou
2953	1	a	Great game with endless possibilities
1358	1	a	Atlis Life If You Want No Life.
5400	1	a	This game is awesome and really realistic with cool graphics! Good Job! 
1055	1	a	Arma3, aside of being a Military simulator, it's a team based play. Out of the 1500hrs I have on record roughly 1400hrs of that has been with the same team... where people have laughed, cried, thrown frags instead of smokes, crashed and survived, crashed and not survived,   Together we have killed russians, talibans, CSAT, tanks, planes, more russians and sometimes when people are not looking the medic.... we have fought together and most importantly, we have walked together.  The adventures you get to do with the team of your choosing will never be forgotten, mostly because they're on twich or youtube...  All in all, play arma, get a good team and enjoy the life of a grunt
4719	1	a	Excellent sandbox simulation, but unlike others I will not say it is a total military simulation. vehicles and aircraft and their controls, pathfinding, etc. need vast improvement for this to even be considered a survey sim. however, ARMA 3 is an excellent infantry simulator and the vehicles and aircraft used as a supporting cast are sufficient. thrown in the community mods, game modes, and missions and nothing can beat ARMA 3. i just wish the grass was not so cheesy looking when you crawl though it, and the graphics were a bit more cinematic. i guess one cannot have everything.
625	1	a	As of late i find this game to be alot more entertaining that the current dayz. although the dayz graphics are better in some ways this just has so much more to do other than run......forever.
3648	1	a	Great Game
2857	1	a	This game is one of the best games i have ever played. It has a large selection of mods that keep it fresh to this day. The multiplayer is amazing with game modes verying from TDM to large scale combat.
44	1	a	Childhood Relived
1322	1	a	Great game
3935	1	a	i just love playing this game!! :3
3701	1	a	By far one of the best game's of all time. It is not only just a milsim but a platform for hundreds of other different game types. such as the life mod or king of the hill. I would deffinently reccomend this game to anyone who has a resonable PC. I could play this game forever as the community and bohemia are actively working on new game types mods etc to provide a deeper expansion of the game.
4802	1	a	buy it for wasteland mod, never regret
3178	1	a	I do recommend this game. This game is great and is very fun. I don't play multiplayer so I won't be talking about that nor do I care about graphics for those of you who only care about the graphics. I personally love open world games and open ended games. So there are quite a few missions that I love and those include Robj's missions and whole lotta altis. I don't really have any complaints because I don't look for problems in games, I just play it and appreciate getting to play games.
1696	1	a	Realistic weapon sounds Good graphics (for today) You feel like a real soldier in the war - in this game . Good Game.
3988	1	a	Great game I would suggest to the people that love army simulator games
3791	1	a	Operating operators operating operationally meets special needs children walking with their asscheeks.
474	1	a	This is a great game, very in-depth shooter.
3998	1	a	I bought this game when it was pre-order, or early acces. I can't remember. Played it for a few minutes, but couldn't find a good community to get into with the multiplayer. It's been about almost a year now, and I've come back to this game to realize I absolutely love it. Arma 2 was good. I had a love hate relationship with it. I tried and tried to find a decent multiplayer server, but I could not. However, I did a bit of digging around and found a great KOTH infantry only server and I'm in love. I'm a HUGE diehard Socom fan and I love the 3rd person feel to the game. Arma 3 fills that spot and I can already tell hours of my soul will belong to Arma now. I don't have a high end pc but I can still hang and contribute a lot towards helping my team win. The movement is better, as well as the overall feeling towards the mobility of your soldier. I give this a thumbs up. I have nothing to complain about. If you love Socom get this game. Play Koth infantry only. You may need to download an Arma 3 launcher that has a lot of other servers on it that deal with mods. Anywhoo, I highly recommend this game.
397	1	a	One Word for this Game:G-R-E-A-T  How many hours does a normal EA title entertain you for like 60-70 Bucks? 5-8 hours, maybe 10-12 hours?  ArmA3 is easily crushing those titles because of re-playability, nearly endless options of customization, building your own szenarios, scripts, addons, islands.   You can even find gametypes and mods, that change the way to play ArmA3. They modify it to be played apart from the original way to play it. (Those mods and missions are Boiling Point, Wasteland, Altis Life RPG)  Some might hit their heads now to a table, as this isnÂ´t the way ArmA is meant to be played. But it shows whats possible with the game and the engine at all =).   This is, what gamers want. A long term motivation (Look at my game hours :D) and a huge sandbox to be entertained for years.  (Sure there are bugs and features, the communitiy is mostly right to complain about) But the steps BIS did to fulfill the wishes of the community, involved changing parts of the team also. Since like 6-7 month the developing and bugfixing gets faster.  ArmA 3 in a nutshell: -A tactic Shooter with simulation elements. -You have to actually think before making a move. -You can have great battles, both coop and team-vs-team. -The Mod support for this game is really great. As above: User created content like islands, content addons, mods, missions, campaigns, replacements. -Even a normal battle between a fireteam gets you harder than it would on every other game here around.   If you search for a game where you are entertained for years, a semi-realistic warfare, combined arms gameplay, an open world sandbox game? Then look no further. Trash the other games and get in soldier!
321	1	a	In my opinion... This is an absolute great game, extremely fun to play. If your thinking about getting it, get it. I purchased this game during the Summer Sale &amp; do not regret it at all. Get this game, you'll love it. Woulda payed $60 for it, if I knew it was this much fun.
2815	1	a	Ultra realistic military game, unlike anything I've ever seen
3522	1	a	Arma is a great series of games and the scope of each title is always more impressive than it's predecessor. Yes, like those it follows ARMA 3 has it's bugs, but these are in no way irritating. At most, they are hilarious.... because you become immersed with experience of being a lethal weapon, methodically removing enemy AI from their short lived lives, when all of a sudden the yells and laughs of comrades 'hoovering' in a tank or being insta-killed by randomly exploding vehicles that touched a small pebble, breaks the cycle!   It's a game you have to try out. You can get into the game quite easily and add to your knowledge as you go. But don't be a lone wolf and complain it was boring. Arma is about team work... and not your Call of Duty or Battlefield TDM capture the flag balls...but actual teamwork where communication and learning your place in a squad keeps you all alive! The A.I. on this game is 'effective' - they will suppress, they will surpise and they definetly do more than just flank you from obvious places. It's very dynamic and lonewolfs die quickly... a good squad will have a much higher survival rate!   So get yourself in a game, be a local on the server and join in with 'regulars' to have the best experience.  There is a lot to learn, but ARMA 3's new tutorial system is far superior to older versions of the game and many of the players online are very helpful.   Heaps of content &amp; the workshop has lots more additions. Goto Armaholic for the best and widest range of addons. My only gripe is that they can still be somewhat difficult to install. So it maybe best to use a loader.   I'm a big fan of the Arma series and this one has raised the bar again!  Get your â¥â¥â¥â¥'s off COD &amp; BF and play a real game!!!   11/10
2344	1	a	Might be a bit expensive but overall after buying it it was hella fun and can spend hours upon hours on it with all the mods and things to do 
3341	1	a	its a lot of fun especialy if you love military tactical and realistic games its FPS and TPS it contains divers paratroopers airforse infantry sniper aormourd vehicals I RECOMEND THIS GAME
5366	0	a	I played 11 hours on the free weekend, and i use to enjoy the flashpoint series but found this game hard to get into and the missions seemed the same most of the time. Only the first episode was available for free but it seemed the same, run through some trees shoot a few enemy then go to objective, shoot a few more, complete objective wait 2 minutes then mission ends.   Couldnt connect to any multiplayer servers so maybe this game is too old now and no one hosts severs for it in the Pacific region?  I might pick it up on the sale again if its 60-70% off but 50% off and I will still hold out on it for now.
255	1	a	The ultimate military simulator that you can actually afford. Highly customizable but comes with a learning curve. Has a lively public community in the forms of Altis Life roleplay or instant-action King of the Hill, but for the real experience you should find a clan or community to play missions with.
380	0	a	I really hate to say this, but you should wait to get this game until BIS gets it finished, assuming that happens. The reader should realize that I have almost 2000hrs in ArmA2. The 600 or so listed on my profile here is just since it got added to Steam and doesn't count the time pre-Steam.  So, as someone who plays exclusively with friends on listen servers, not on big public servers. As someone who plays mostly CTI maps (remember those BIS?), and as someone who spent most of those almost 2000hrs flying CAS in a jet (remember those BIS?), .......I can honestly say that I'm rather let down by ArmA 3 and it makes me very sad.  The interface has always been clunky from way back in OFP and before. The new backpack system seems to me to just be a reskin of the same thing. It does indeed make it a bit easier to use being able to drag and drop stuff (novel!!), and while I appreciate the work here.....I'd rather have seen the time spent on other things.  To be fair, two of the devs DID spend time locked up in Greece for a stupid reason. I think it was 11 months? This is something that is strictly forbidden to speak of on their forums for some odd reason. But, I understand this had a huuuuuuge impact on their development cycle as it was their two LEAD devs as I understand it. I get the feeling that they got back, and shoved development through in order to compete with the (then) new BF and CoD releases. I personally feel this was a huge, quivering pile of mistake. Because......they aren't really in competition with those games!!! It'd be like saying that chess competes with checkers and monopoly. All board games sure but vastly different. Same here! ArmA II was all about trying to make the game more of a military simulator. Though I think they had to admit some limitations here and there with the tech of the day without making the engine only playable on super computers. ArmA III seems to go away from this and I think it's trying to compete even more now with those other games in some ways.....maybe I'm wrong? It just doesn't feel like the team is as worried about realisim any longer.  For me, the fact that it's set in 2035 is a HHHHUUUUUUUGE turn-off and almost a game breaker right there. That, and there's ONE jet in the game thus far.....one AND it's some old trainer POS to boot.....nice.....well guess this confirms my hunch I've had for a while now. BIS seems to hate fixed wing like Blizzard hates melee! It's all about rotary wing! Which is fine and dandy unless you need an A10 or a Spooky. By 2035 we assume naturally that these have been phased out, so where are their replacements? Hell, at this point I'd be happy with an F15 that I can just fly and do stand-off attacks with from miles away.....oh right that's what the choppers are for!  Am I ranting a bit there? Um, yes sorry, but I was just looking SO foward to this game!!! Heck I even did the pre-order on the delux version!! NOW? Ya I'm kinda not happy about that.  I fire the game up now and then after I see an update downloading. Just to mess around with the undrivable pickups and do target practice with the assault rifles that have recoil like a .45-110 every shot......it's like going to the playboy mansion only nobody's there.  So, I'd say to wait on this game. I'm still playing ArmAII where I can fly fixed wings even in the base game. Oh yes I know...mods mods mods....ya *hangs head*
2753	1	a	I have played ARMA III for about a few months. I really enjoyed it, Bohemia Interactive actually made a better ARMA! It has perfect Voice Overs instead of ARMA 2 where they read grids lke 2- 1-5-3-5 but in different voices instead of one. I also like the movemet it is great if you want to see over something all you got to do is hold control + w or any wasd key to go in other positions. I onl suggest this game if you got a great computer C: G'day.
555	1	a	Best tactical shooter on the market. 10/10
4691	1	a	I absolutely love this game
4372	1	a	I bought the game and all the DLC for $80 My game crashes ten minutes after I join a server.   Best ten minutes of my life   10/10 
2261	1	a	Bugs, Hackers, glitches, Unfinnished patches, Unreleased vehicles, Just right there would be enough to steer away anyone from purchasing this game. However, even with all that I still will play Arma III. The online multiplayer experiences are pheonominal, and definetly unique. If you've ever played massive online sandbox fps, for example, Planetside 2, you will know the kind of online experiences to expect, however unlike other sandbox MMOs, the experiences you get with Arma, are changing. Its not a repetitive, boring, same old grind. Depending on what server you want to play on, you can find yourself, playing with other players against AIs, using modern military tatics and utilizing resources to save a down player pilot, or you can find yourself running drugs in the cover of night trying to evade player police. As long as I have played Arma III, I cannot say that it has been boring for me. However this game is not for everyone, so if your not into the sandbox effect, i would continue on with your day, but if you enjoy unique experiences, and a endless interaction, then I highly recommend Arma III.
1960	1	a	ARMA 3 -   While most of my time on this game has been on multiplayer servers, I can at least give a review on that aspect of the game.   So far, it has been very enjoyable. Improvements have been made and many of the annoying bugs (such as dying on stairs) have been fixed. Community mod support is excellent and has helped create things like Exile and Breaking Point.  The game is NOT very well optimized and this something that needs MAJOR work. My GTX 980 sometimes gets 20FPS on some servers.  But, overall, gameplay is great, community is great, physics are...semi-great.  8/10
2736	1	a	This is one of the best games I have ever owned, and the game ive had the most fun on. It might have its glitches and meh optimization but its still a great game. just buy it.
5193	1	a	If your looking for an review you wont find it here. BUT! I have a recipe for perfect Egg Salad.    INGREDIENTS 6 HARD-BOILED EGGS, sliced 1/4 cup mayonnaise 2 tsp. fresh lemon juice 1 tbsp. minced onion 1/4 tsp. salt 1/4 tsp. pepper 1/2 cup finely chopped celery Lettuce leaves    INGREDIENTS 6 HARD-BOILED EGGS, sliced 1/4 cup mayonnaise 2 tsp. fresh lemon juice 1 tbsp. minced onion 1/4 tsp. salt 1/4 tsp. pepper 1/2 cup finely chopped celery Lettuce leaves Yields: 4 servings NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION DIRECTIONS  RESERVE and refrigerate 4 center egg slices for garnish, if desired. CHOP remaining eggs.  MIX mayonnaise, lemon juice, onion, salt and pepper in medium bowl. ADD chopped eggs and celery; mix well. REFRIGERATE, covered, to blend flavors.  SERVE on lettuce leaves, garnished with reserved egg slices.  Easy 12-Minute Method for Hard-Boiled Eggs: Place eggs in a saucepan large enough to hold them in a single layer. Add cold water to cover the eggs by 1 inch. Heat over high heat just to boiling. Remove from the burner. Cover pan. Let eggs stand in hot water for about 12 minutes for large eggs (9 minutes for medium eggs; 15 minutes for extra large eggs). Drain. Shock the eggs in a bowl of ice water to cool them immediately. Hard-boiled eggs are easiest to peel right after cooling.    Tips   This creamy egg salad can be layered with crunchy lettuce on whole wheat toast for a simple sandwich, or stuffed into cherry tomatoes for an impressive appetizer.  Very fresh eggs can be difficult to peel. To ensure easily peeled eggs, buy and refrigerate them a week to 10 days in advance of cooking. This brief âbreatherâ allows the eggs time to take in air, which helps separate the membranes from the shell.  Hard-boiled eggs are easiest to peel right after cooling. Cooling causes the egg to contract slightly in the shell.  To peel a hard-boiled egg: Gently tap egg on countertop until shell is finely crackled all over. Roll egg between hands to loosen shell. Starting peeling at large end, holding egg under cold running water to help ease the shell off.  Hard-boiled egg storage time: In the shell, hard-boiled eggs can be refrigerated safely up to one week. Refrigerate in their original carton to prevent odor absorption. Once peeled, eggs should be eaten that day.  ENJOY!
4155	0	a	I wish i could both recommend and not recommend... but ultimately, i hate it.. it has such potential... if you like single player shooters, this game is pretty good. the campaign is pretty neat.. that's about it.. i got this game cause i prefer sims, over arcadey type games (CoD)... and the sim level is there... the problems start at online play. you need to be a member of a secret society, to actually get any war play going on online. and neither have the desire for that, nor the time or dedication.. this was evident almost immediately. all the online servers are really stupid GTA meets 2nd life meets the sims mod crap. its insanely stupid and boring.. unless you hunt down some online community of people who actually want to play a war game, you wont get that online from this game.. no official servers or official game modes (that i could find).. its highly annoying.. within an hour i wanted a refund, but at the time i had a baby, and he started crying and i left the game open, and it went past the 2 hour limit (5hours it claimed) i repeatedly email steam, trying to explain the situation, and all i got was the same auto response... a complete waste of money.. so i uninstalled... then with news stirring that it was going to get a dx12 update, i thought i would give another shot since i was stuck with this piece of crap anyway.. multiplayer is still absolute garbage if you don;t want to be active in a community.. so i played the campaign, it was ok till the second chapter, where the first mission is solo stealth with no guns garbage, and i lost interest again... up until that point, it was enjoyable.. about a 7 out of 10..   i dunno.. mixed emotions.. if you want to play a slower more boring versions of gta online with better physics.. this might be your game.. if you want to deal with online forums and locked private servers to get a battle in, this might be your game...if you like single player campaigns, might be your game.. if you like, single player target practice, might be your game.. it has all the potential in the world... with absolutely no delivery to anyone who just wants to hop into a battle and shoot.. (wasn't expecting a run and gun, but i was expecting to play a war game, not a run around grinding gold with stupid rules and having to have a job rpg) i would say avoid it.. i tried so hard to get a refund, but steam sucks, and i couldn't even get a real response from a human being.. now im stuck with this useless single player game.. i keep trying to force myself to find something fun to do with it, and it can't be done... on the other hand technically and graphically it;s amazing and the attention to details is great... it was just squandered on a community with terrible terrible terrible ideas on how it should be played... the addition of official servers wih official game modes, would make this game a 10 out of 10... until then, its like a 2.. unless you like pretending to be an under paid truck driver that gets harrasse by lame people who think they are digital police..  i personally wish i never spent a dime on this game...
863	1	a	Good game maybe a little work but i see a lot of mods being made in futrue.
1586	1	a	It is a great game for people who like to play games that challenge them not just mentally but phsically becuase it is really addicting to people who like realistic combat and fight where there is bullet drop and hardcore gaming.
3553	1	a	Not only has ARMA 3 provided countless hours of fun and a totally unique experience, but Bohemia Interactive should also be commended for their consumer-friendly conduct.
4256	1	a	After 400 hrs playing ARMA3 i find it exciting and challenging, the editor is another world on its own, then theres muitiplay a whole lot af different roleplay . From police ,dedic,rebel and even sell body parts . I give it a 10 as far as rpg go.
1373	1	a	This game is great, especially with friends, Breaking Point also adds so much to this already amazing game! :D
3411	1	a	10/10 would forget controls again
3318	1	a	IT'S NOT A ORDINARY SHOOTER. IT'S A REAL WAR IN YOUR COMPUTER!!!
4247	1	a	Make arma not war! arma is the best military simulator out there! You will not believe the hours you can throw away at this game while playing the endless multiplayer servers such as life! - in which nothing can compete!!! Grab some friends and join a server, only then shal you understand! Brilliant. 9/10
3982	1	a	Looted the corpse of my fallen comrade and took his sunglasses.  10/10 respec for your fallen bredas.
1793	1	a	Ultra-realistic...in a way.
4082	1	a	Arma 3, the game of the century. One of my all time favorites. Hell, it is my all time favorite. I have been gaming for most of my life, and have yet to find another game that I play or played as much as this one. I have been PC gaming since 2013 and started off with Arma 2 and Operation Arrowhead. I didn't get Arma 3 until about May of 2014. Then did I realize the immense amount the game has to offer. From racing go karts to fighting in Vietnam Arma 3 has brought everything to the table. Bohemia has done a great job but not recently when they haven't been able to find out a few problems such as the texture bug. I still do enjoy the game and all it has to offer and I really want to give it up to the creators of the mods and everything because it really pulls everything together in the world of Arma. That is just my two cents though.
1984	1	a	Reaching my 200th hour on this game made me decide to write a review. To start, this game has hooked me for 200 hours of tactical combat over the last 4/5 months or so. (Yes I did buy it at Christmas, so what.) I came to this game from its prequel. I mainly played Wasteland but did a bit of Domination. I loaded that game up on Christmas day and the main menu music already had me hooked. I browsed for wasteland servers and oh boy did I find one. Started up as BLUFOR and noticed my teammates were actually not shooting me, which was a variation from the prequel. Also the UI wasn't â¥â¥â¥â¥ and navigating felt more logical. I soon discovered 77th JSOC and then I have spent all of my free time on that. Wibble, if you're reading this, never let that guy in the AMV-7 again, he TK'd my whole squad. :( â¥â¥â¥â¥ing great game and HALF DECENT community.  But the bugs. Plenty of laughter to them, and they're no longer game breaking. Play this game. Or I will forever hate you.
2293	1	a	:)
3665	1	a	Buy this â¥â¥â¥â¥ homie, amazing game bruh
2679	1	a	  I jumped off a roof when I couldn't run this on my old computer...
5269	0	a	D3D Error - DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_REMOVED  Basically I cant play the game. Unfixable error since 2015.
1144	1	a	its a great game
1811	1	a	I absolutely love this game. I have played this game for almost 1000 hours now and I have done so much. There are so many different gamemodes you can play from roleplaying to coop missions to military simulations. I have listed my pros and cons below:  Pros: - Amazing Graphics - Multiple Gamemodes - Active Development Team - Very little bugs - Campaign - Multiplayer - Steam Workshop  Cons: - You need a high end PC to run at max graphics - Some servers are controlled by people that ruin that gamemode - Most servers are European. - Bugs that will just kill you for no reason.  Overall I would rate this game a 8/10.
3741	1	a	This game is definately not your standard cod run and gun type of game. You are forced to use tactics and the enviroment around you to gain the advantage and with all the multiplayer content as well as custom missions/mods you will never get bored.
838	1	a	Amazing graphics, Well up to date compared to other games. Most extreme militray simulater
250	1	a	Got 15 FPS to listen to two people scream at new players while we made a tactical blob of human bodies and drowned the enemy in our own corpses.  10/10 best Napoleanic war simulator.
3713	1	a	i think this game should win because it never gets old.
659	1	a	Excellent, just absolutely excellent game. The possibilites and endless scenarios that you can create yourself just makes this games one of the best games of this genre, and possibly one of the better and more unique games for PC.  Unrivalled in creativity and possibilities, ArmA 3 is a masterpiece added to the genre. Bohemia delivers, yet again.
2820	1	a	Awesome. 30 FPS with mario graphics .  I Can only compare how hard this game is to run .... like a boner , hard at first , then after a while you just deal with it
4353	1	a	It's ok.
1488	1	a	ArmA rating as a game-6/10 ArmA rating as a sandbox-11/10 
2826	1	a	good game mediocre performance
2884	1	a	  Really cool u need a good computer to have good graphics and make it smooth
5311	1	a	I bouth this game in Alpha for 20 euro, now its for 45 euro. Enjoy
4877	1	a	Arma 3 is fun
2996	1	a	Big difference over arma 2. Very fun, and can be challenging. Online play is amazing!
3116	1	a	If u dont like fast paste fps games, but you like games that are slow paste tactical sneaky beaky stylish games, this game is for you.    Pros    - Great graphics - fun to play - very tactical game - customizable weapons etc - ingame map editor - mod support +++++ - very well created tutorials - multiplayer support - etc    Cons    - only and the biggest complain about this game is the fps, you gotta have good pc if you want to run this game on high. ofcourse you can do some tweaking that will give u little fps boost but still fps is not the greatest
5275	1	a	Amazing game! Worth the dough
3909	1	a	Awesome Tactical gameplay, If you enjoy simulations, This is NOT COD or BF4!!!!
1553	1	a	love this game!
4228	1	a	Good game with great mod's
604	1	a	I love it :)
596	0	a	So where do I start!! Review is below please read all before passing judgement :)  I'm so so so disappointed :( I bought a PC again after a massive 8 year PC break when I moved to console in very late 2006 . I bought an Xbox 360 which I owned for almost 6 years then only 13months ago I moved too XBox One had it for 4 months and thought get rid of this piece of junk and use the money I get and put it towards a new Gaming PC so june this year (2014) I bought a PC.    Anyway so I bought a PC with one thing in my mind 'Yes it will be like the old days I will join back up with my clan' I was with almost 7 years ago. I enjoyed countless hours days weeks years with the lads on Operation Flashpoint : Cold War, Arma and then Arma 2. I was in the AirCorps for them 'GOL' clan they are called so I signed up for them cause I forgot my password (come on its been 7 years ago) and used the same name as I was back in 2006 ish 'GOL Tactical' I thought wow its been that long I was wiped from there system :) Anyway LT Chris didnt know how I was so I mentioned a few names to him and that were old clan memebers and he stopped talking for a split second 'are its you Bloody knife' (which was my original name before changing to GOL Clan when I )was expected) The guy that made me start an AirCorps. I was so excited to be back sadly most of the old memebers werent around (god I sound like a child Im' 25).   Sorry for all the text above :) I just wanted you/people to know that I've played Arma before for alot longer than most 7 years straight. I bet most reading this didnt know about Operation Flashpoint was originally part of the same team that is today currently making Amra still today.    Anyway present day 30/12/2014  The Review  I'm sorry but the Arma I grew up to love is just not the same Arma! Arma 3 is like to me the Call Of Duty of today every childs dream, its the game that they must have otherwise your not cool etc although that last statment isn't true for Arma franchise it only came extemely popular in like 2007 to early 2008.   Thats how much I love or sould I say loved Arma it was my goto game whenever I was bored I would talk about Arma when I was at school when I was with anyone, as soon as I got in Lets play Arma whenever I had spare time Lets Play Arma I even bunked/skipped days of school to play more. I just didnt get bored of Arma or Arma 2 or Operation Flashpoint Cold Assault if I'm honest it consumed all of my early teens and into my late teens. Yes a full 7 years of my life  I was coming up to be 19 and on my birthday I bought a Xboxb 360, go and read the above for a full discription :)  So the Arma I knew was a realistic military simulator the best simulator infact but Arma 3 what have you done you've gone slightly futurisitc. Why? Its a military sim how can you simulate something that isnt even made yet keep it with the real life stuff that is used today you at least in my eyes have ruined my childhood game thanks Bohemia Interactive and 555 games thanks a bunch.    It isnt all bad though its just because of my history with the game as you can tell they are many happy customers giving good reviews. But if Arma 1 and 2 and 2.5 is anything to go by hopefully they are modders out there that feel the same way as me and remove all the futuristic stuff and replace with Real Equipment Weapons etc that are used today  If you got this far thanks for reading and dont base the game of my review its just because of my history with the game. The core components are there with what I can assume is realistic simulation its just not me furturisitc stuff in a Simulator you cant call it a sim in my eyes anyway. So as you can tell I dont recommend this game. Even the it almost hurts to say it : (
3623	1	a	One of the best games for tactical teams, modder, kids and people how like roleplay.  Everything is possible in Arma 3
2517	1	a	The one of the best game EVER 4EVER!!!!!
1230	1	a	I played it a little. It's ok.
4501	1	a	Oh Armaâ¦ How I love you.  I have put a pretty good amount of time into this game and I believe I can give my opinion on it. Where do I startâ¦   Experience. This game has SO much to offer and I can easily explain why. I have the worst computer you could possibly haveâ¦ It is total trash. With my computer I can only run arma at minimal settings, I cant play multiplayer and I can only play on one of the 3 maps. My machine is 9 years old. The graphics card is totally outdated, yet I still manage with 32 fps on minimal settings. I have a bad memory leak with my shity 4gb of ram. It stops me from playing any type of multiplayer and I can only play on the smallest map, Straits. Yet I still manage to have so much fun playing on a tiny map without multiplayer. Worse still, I can only play for an hour before my game crashes due to the memory leak. Yetâ¦ I have over 320 hours playedâ¦ That is how much this game has to offer. Id say I only experience about 5% of what arma has to offer and just look at my time played. That is how many hours you can put into this game and still be entertained.  Repetition. Most games tend to get boring after you play them for a while, however good ones manage to keep you into the game for a very long time. Take civilization 5 for example. You try to play for 15 minutes, but end up playing for 12 hours. Arma does the same for me. I can keep playing this game for hours at a time before I finally stop, and remember how shity my computer is... That is saying something.  Fun. How this one you might find funny or bad. While arma will state that it is a âRealistic Military simulatorâ it has some really funny glitches and other things. I have sent my helicopter to space because I tried to land it on a quad. I have taken screenshots of some really funny death poses and body glitches. I have used a set speed script to make my tank go 500 miles per hour. It can be really fun to do, however if you are not a fan of being able to do this in a âRealistic Military simulatorâ then that might put you down.  The steam workshop/Modding sites. One of the main reasons that this game has so much to offer is because of the mods available. There are so many great scenarios,mods, maps and so much more that so can simply download in a matter of minutes. I can even begin to describe them due to how diverse they are.  While I would like to make my reveiw longerâ¦ I have yet to experience the rest of arma. I will be getting a new machine soon and then I will make a full review, but for now I will leave it as it is.  Overall this game is great. I can easily say that this game is worth the price and I can easily say that you will enjoy it. Even with a crappy computer I have managed to spend over 320 hours playing this game with the machine I have.   (Note) There are a few negative things that I do have problems with, but I wanted to keep my review as positive as possible.
839	1	a	Beautiful Game - Comes with a vast modding capacity, but not much stability for mods in terms of platform upgrades when they release. Unfortunately thats life, but hey, the mods update again and its all good to go.
3148	1	a	10/10 real life simulator in a third world Country.
894	1	a	Outstanding. Closest you can get to realistic military tactical gameplay!
4252	1	a	Loving this game, favorite game type to play is King of the Hill. Highly recommended!
2687	1	a	I have several hours in this game. My friends got me into it a bit after it released, and although I'm not the best this game is always fun. I love playing the mods like Epoch and Exile.  This game is a must have for all gamers. You can really benchmark your machine with it. So photo realistic even on the medium settings.
1414	1	a	To be honest ArmA 3 alone is good but the community mods for it are really what makes the game come alive in the mil sim community! Once you go ArmA you will never go back.
4289	1	a	10/10 would die to a nuke again
1377	1	a	Very realistic military detail. Accurate radio chatter, sounds, and ballistic mechanics. Use of tactics is vital unlike Call of Duty and that crap where you shoot your way through everything. If you want to immerse your self in a lifelike warzone experience wait till this game is on sale and buy it.
43	1	a	I've been playing these titles since they were released during the late 90s. The soundtrack is pretty relaxing and enjoyable. The Game is just epic, i am happy that the game's had being released on steam.  If you dont own or have this epic, this is a must buy game.
4302	1	a	Find server. Altis Life. Buy car. Call police. Allahu Akbar. Bans from server. 10/10 would do it again.
4920	1	a	If you are the type of person that likes military shooters and/or Milsim, this is the game for you. Great graphics, but slow at times. Mulitplayer fps is not the best. But this game is VERY CPU dependant. I reccomend this game if you have a good pc
1822	1	a	Buy this game. Just buy it... You won't be disappointed!
3296	1	a	 &gt;Joins wasteland server &gt;Loots heaps of really good â¥â¥â¥â¥ &gt;Falls less than a centimeter &gt;Dies  10/10 would fall to my doom again   Disregard my last review of this game. Arma has been shrivled down to a framework for making roleplay gamemodes.  Never have I seen a server that has decent PvP or combat gameplay. The only thing you'll find on the server browser is Tanoa/Altis life or heavily modded DayZ clones that make you download 10gb worth of mods for each server.  This game has too much potential. Are we going to waste it on making RP servers that don't even allow for usage of the great gameplay Arma provides?  I'm still giving this a thumbs up because the game itself is great, but the server owner's don't know an existance that isn't roleplay.
1445	1	a	Love this game, Great realistic military simulator. Complex yet easy to learn. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in the military, firstperson-shooters, and action games.
3871	1	a	really awesome game to play, one of my best games
4450	1	a	Very Good.
3889	1	a	- Zip tied someone - Take them to the top of a church - Cut the poor soul's kidney out of their body - make them jump while being shot at and hearing gaben being chanted  best game - 10/10
4687	1	a	im going to give my honest opinion, the community is what makes this game worthwhile, everything from arma life to wasteland, i really enjoy it. However the base game is not great...
4584	1	a	Awsome game ;)
4455	1	a	Arma 3 is probably one of the best games ever in my opinion. The RPG is unbeatable and people who play this game like to actully play it legit.
3971	1	a	It's almost as if it's real.
88	1	a	So..you're here to possibly buy Arma 3..I was in that position before, I just bought it when it was 50% off.  Here's a checklist for you:  Do you like Call of Duty? Can you 360 no scope in CoD? Do you like 9 year olds screaming on the mic?  If you answered yes to those then this game is NOT for you.  Do you like CS:GO? Are you a pro AWPer in CS:GO?  Well if you answered yes this game will rip you apart and you will be a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ sniper.  Do you like simulators? Do you like military games? Are you up for the challenge? Do you want an alternative to joining the military in real life? Do you have at least $30?  If so, then you are ready for this challenge.  --------------  Pros:  MASSIVE REALISTIC COMBAT servers with 100+ people  Few 'squeakers' on mics  Steam Workshop  Many players still today.  Single player Modes  Tutorials, and all kinds of training for practice.  --------------------- Cons:  $60 pricey, but worth more than any call of duty game.  â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ AI - It's ok, playable.  Lag - This game is apparently heavily dependent on CPU in huge multiplayer games your fps can drop from over 9000 to 20 in a matter of seconds.  Glitches  Bugs  When people shoot from far away it sounds like BB guns.  Trolls in multiplayer - they can steal your helicopters and â¥â¥â¥â¥ you buy or just be a pilot and kamikazi with you in it.  Doesn't come with cookies. 
3108	1	a	If your into war games this is the one. Realistic and lots of fun with friends.
375	0	a	Great game if you intend to play it with friends online. â¥â¥â¥â¥ poor if you're planning on playing it singleplayer. If you are I'd wait until they fix all the bugs (especially the AI). The AI in this game is the worst I've ever seen. In anything. Just a couple of minutes ago an AI soldier in my squad ran out 1 meter in front of me while I was still shooting (I'd been lying in the grass fiering at the same location for a good while) and was cut down by my bullets. Mission failed. And that was the third or fourth time that happened. And the opposing AI is not better. It's as if the developers realized their AI sucked so they just gave it wallhack and aim bot. Literally. You can be in a forest somewhere, covered by rocks and bushed, fiering at an enemy 100 meters away. The second you shoot, all his friends will immediatly turn and start shooting at you, most likely hitting you straight in the face in their 3rd or 4th shot. Not running for cover or even going prone, just standing like a poor imitation of schwartzenegger and shooting from the hip. That is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t AI if I ever saw one.  EDIT: Yeah, don't play it multiplayer either.. Glitches where you get stuck in doors, your character just rise up from prone at the worst possible occations and when you get shot through walls because your feet or backpack was no-clipping through it so they could see you through the other side. And this happens all the time. Such an awesome game in theory. Such increadibly terrible execution.
3294	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ me in the â¥â¥â¥ and call me samantha, this is a good game.
1605	1	a	Bye Or Die,as simple as that! 
4629	1	a	Recommend to anyone who likes any sort of combat game. Has great balance of first person combat and vehicle (sea, land and air) combat.  The weapons don't customise very much, but that doesnt matter so much as there is a VERY wide range of weapons and attachments. Very well optimised and runs smoothly on all occasions. The only problem is if you are playing online with a computer running at low settings, as you cannot see enemys as clear or as far away as those with higher grade computers can, and sometimes becomes annoying. But the game is worth the purchase just for the campain.
4282	1	a	Awesome Game. Would definitely reccomend
4178	0	a	Compared to Arma 2? This game is horrible. Now don't get me wrong, I love the hell out of Arma 2, a game which I've put more than 460 hours into. I've played everything from Wasteland, Takistan Life, Domination to DayZ. But this game...   Cons:  - The bugs. The desyncs. The clunky gameplay. One would think we'd have a smooth game after all these years, but no. It's the same clunky mechanics and awful netcode (expect those close combat 'But I just put an ENTIRE clip into that guy and he still killed me before I killed him!')  - The recoil mechanics aren't 'realistic', they are so bad that with many guns you simply empty entire magazines regardless of shot number (single or burts) and you will still miss. Where in Arma 2 at least the first shot will generally hit, the guns here are inaccurate as all hell which kills a large portion of the game for me,  - The stamina system is even worse, it runs out extremely fast and there's barely any indicator besides a faint darkening vignette around the edges of the screen to tell you that you're essentially â¥â¥â¥â¥ed if you meet any adversaries. In Arma 2, you can hear your guy gasp for breath and your crosshairs fly all over the screen if you've tried to pull an Usain Bolt.   - Where in Arma 2 a single bullet can take you out, they seem to have appealed to the more mainstream gaming community and implemented some form of 'Oh look, Bob, I'm a bullet sponge.'    Pros:  - The graphics are amazing. Don't expect a well-oiled game experience to match.  - The intro story is good.   I will still not recommend this game. I've tried to play it and enjoy it, but it's a waste of money. But what am I saying? Go listen to those 'crashed car into pole 10/10 would do again' children.
1843	1	a	i love this . even more than myself :D  this game is great also it has unblieveable Graphics on the other hand it has alot of modes  u gotta play this one
883	1	a	Arma 3 is one, maybe, the best military shooter on earth.  I played ~1k+ Hours and can say: Well done Bohemia, well done.  This game is so f*cking massiv.   You can spend so much time, in much more Mods, Maps and Missions.   The steamworkshop is full with single- and coopmissons.  So u can spend so much time in play vs. bots without or with friends.   If u check the serverlist, u can see this game offers much more than the same s*it.   There server for each priority.  If u like like battelfield - King of the Hill [KotH] If u like hard close- also rangecombat man by man - BattleRoyal If u like to play a character, play in a 'virtual' world - Life Server/RP Server  In sale this awesome game cost only ~17â¬-25â¬. Buy this â¥â¥â¥â¥! Buy it!
2320	1	a	Shooting flying submarines with lightning, 10/10
4304	1	a	Great game!
3824	1	a	What arma is for newbies: A awkward horribly optimized stupidly clumsy military shooter.  What arma is for veterans: A awkward horribly optimized stupidly clumsy military shooter.  Never change arma.  
4287	1	a	Fun, tactical interesting war simulator. Variety of online/singleplay gameplay!
4833	1	a	I highly recommend this game. very realistic, very hard. what i like most about this game is the combat is not over in 5 seconds like most action game eg call of duty. Also with all the wide range of guns and very unique future vehicle makes this game incredibly fun.
3949	1	a	by far one of the most expensive games i bought (lel). besides from that it is also one of the funnest. Atlis Life is best. Love love love. iz like sperm
4325	0	a	you know the funny thing is, This game is becoming a money horder. Apex is 34 Dollars. Orignal game is 40 Dollars. Apex isent half of the game... Yet it is more than half of the price. *Facepalm* Dont reccomend buying this OR Apex till a sale...
4245	1	a	Shooty shooty good, driving okay, flying hard. 10/10 bullets either tickle or are fired near you and you die.
2139	1	a	after they released apex the game has become so buggy and unoptimized its not even funny
2493	1	a	*clears throat* WHY DOES IT ALWAYS SAY ITS RUNNING EVEN THOUGH I CAN PLAY OTHER STEAM GAMES *breaths deeply* FIX YOUR GAME PLEASE!!! :but i do recommend the editor mode.
5370	0	a	I thought I would love this game, but after dealing with sloppy menu systems, unoptimized game settings, and ridiculously varying quality in gameplay, I just wish I never spent the money on this. All the online gameplay shown is under incredibly set terms that you'll almost never see without dedicating a ton of time to a community with a teamspeak.  
1398	1	a	This is an amazing game. king of the hill is a fun sector control game. but he cake is given to the Breaking Point Zombie Mod. At only a mod of a few months already better then Day Z SA.
2030	1	a	10/10 nothing to say pure realism
2700	1	a	Anyone into Realistic FPS, this is the game for you. You can add mods to make it more realistic than it already is and you can find a lot of clans/squads who do real training like you're in the military.
3380	1	a	Nothing like running around a 120 player war zone in your whitie-tighties
4777	1	a	im not addicted
2566	1	a	Extremely frustrating at times but well worth the buy.
1460	1	a	This game requires a good pc, my pc is a decent pc with a brand new graphics card and it is still struggling a little to run this game but, it is deffinitaly a good game.
2845	1	a	A great game very fun for life servers and Milsim things everyone should Play.
2997	1	a	flopped over from bullet 10/10 would flop
1558	1	a	It is the most wonderfull game/simulator that i have ever played. It has a fantastic engine, but it still needs some things. There are mods for this game tha should be apart of the original content. But with that said, mods are always available. 9/10 for me x)
859	1	a	this game is a simulation and it takes alot of tatics to play so if you like tactics and realistic games then this game is for you 
30	1	a	This game very amazing. Hoping that they will make Age of Empires IV!
3354	1	a	Altis life in a nutshell:  -Takes 150,000$ out of his atm to go buy a helicopter -Gets stopped and robbed all my money on the road to the airport -Goes back to the copper mine to earn money -Gets stopped and robbed by a kid admin, except i already got robbed before so i had 0$ -Asks me if i could drive him somewhere -i insult him and i drive off  -'Kicked by admin, reason: being rude'  10/10 would get robbed again
3097	1	a	LOVE HOW IT CRASHES EVERY 5 MINUTES. WANT $60 BACK 
1313	1	a	Me and my friend were driving along in a truck. I asked my friend 'Are there any tanks in ARMA 3?' He replies 'Tanks in this game are like unicorns, you get them if you wish for them.' A minute later we come across a tank parked at the side of the road. 'Hmm did I just get my wish granted?' We get out and inspect the tank. It appears to be not occupied. We turn to leave and hear a sound. Suddenly we are both shot in the back. As I lay there, with my life slowly draining out of me, I see the tank blow up our truck and drive away. 'Goddamm it why did I have to wish for my stupid unicorn!' Then I respawned.  10/10 would wish for unicorn again
4505	1	a	- Best Military Simulator for Infantry. - Great Mod Community
2719	1	a	its good
4411	0	a	Oh, so you are soldier ready for some action ? Avid sniper ready to take souls of your enemies from kilometer away ? Helicopter pilot inbound to support your troops ? Nope, you have to buy DLC for that, an overpriced one.   Bloody Bohemia, you own best milsim franchise out there, one of the most popular survival games, and you are telling me I need to support you with these DLCs which are just basic content ripped of game. Don't take the path of Ubisoft or EA, you can do better. I think 45â¬ is more than enough for full content of game.  Game 10/10 DLCs ripoff 0/10  Get your margeting together.
1265	1	a	Collect flowers and bugs in the lands of Altis and Stratis with a bit of get f*cked up the rear while doing it. 9/10
1724	1	a	This game is great. Lots of hours wasted. +Graphics are stunning +Not too many bugs, and not really any game breaking bugs +Mods fully supported, and plenty of them out there to find a server to fit you +Realistic not one fo those CoD wannabe's - Addicting - Long distances on foot, take forever - Might need to upgrade PC to handle the high graphics
3442	1	a	Paradropped in my underwear, landed on top of an enemy tank and died in my underwear. 11/10 would do it again!
744	1	a	If you are looking for a proper Army/War Sim this is what you need. Forget Battlefield, COD and all the rest. Arma III is a sandbox true as you will find sim. Not only that the modding community are 2nd to none, adding tones of extra content.
93	1	a	&gt;Bought a server online. &gt;Placed server in basement and turns it on. &gt;Play two hours of arma altis life with friends and one random dude. &gt;Give all friends including random dude admin powers. &gt;Leave server on so they can play. &gt;Forget about friends/server for six months due to life. &gt;Log back on PC after six months. &gt;3,600 emails... &gt;Random dude started Altis life community that gets 100+ people a day with people I don't know. &gt;Message random dude. &gt; Says he made this for me and gave me 10% of donations. &gt;I am happy. &gt;Tell him to keep it up. &gt;Forget again for another six months due to life. &gt; Find server under fourteen boxes of â¥â¥â¥â¥ and turn my pc back on because I want to play again. &gt; Join server, no admin powers, get confused, call admin, he doesn't believe me, ask for random dude: He bans me. &gt; Tell random dude what happened; He tells admin what he just did; admin says hes' sorry. &gt;Log off. &gt;Join next day. &gt; Still no admin powers; start playing normally. &gt; Man says he has 600 million in his bank acount while he is mugging a helpless newby. &gt; Getangry.jpg &gt; Goes on server forums saying: SERVER WIPE COMING THIS THURSDAY. &gt; Mass panic. &gt; Random dude says to stop. &gt; I say its my server, my rules. &gt;Don't restart. &gt;Continue to mess with people on the server by deleting all their money because they're â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. My profile picture pretty much is random dude's face when I banned him for taking 90% donations.   This is my only experience of arma etc the campaign.  I like it.   
2260	1	a	ArmA II with physics. Finally.
1376	1	a	Best game ever 10/10 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sooooo goood the game is jsut just so awsome and so much fun!
2961	1	a	A big improvement on the previous 2. Shooting in the previous 2 games felt more like shooting a shotgun glued to the end of a broom stick. Arma 3 has a great shooting model and an actually genuinely good single player campaign.
1464	1	a	this game is awsome, if you are looking for a military based game that is as real as a game can get, then this game has your name writen all over it. you need communication, team work, and strategy to win, lone wolfing it or running guns blazin will fail like there is no tomorrow!
3077	1	a	Great Game! Tons of gamemodes and tons of things to do. The campaign is awesome along with the multiplayer. I would reccomend this game! 10/10
1241	1	a	11/10
1833	1	a	The most realistic game for true tacticians or some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.  9/11
2556	1	a	Best game ever, can't get enough of it. With all the mods and missions for this game it has endless potential and opportunities. Must have for shooter fans.
1637	1	a	Where can I start with Arma 3... My friends and I spend countless hours on this game. After hours of screaming at my friends while hearing bullets snap above my head to give me suppresion fire while i move towards the treeline to get cover i hear my friends yelling over the chattery radio saying our friend was down. Arma 3 is truly the only experince you will get with your friends screaming at you saying a guy entered your compound and is pushing your building to engage. I must say that for every hour i spent on this game was worth the money spent. Some what salty community. But other than that you should be just fine with making friends upon mods like exile or Epoch. As a advanced Heli Pilot for my squad i dropped 50$ on a joy stick and love it to death this game has so many feature to put you at a higher advantage than other's but when it boils down to your PvP its all skill from there the zeroing is pretty realistic and has the feel of a sniper sitting out at 1,200 meters from his targets and watch them drop as you cover your squad as they breach the building. I introduced the game to a couple of my friends they gave it a try and now I play it with them every day. Engaging situations with your team is fun as well, As you must have great communication and reation time to complete your task. for the price goes 60$USD is for sure worth it but i'd pick it up on sale just so you can get the DLC as well. for PC specs the game doesn't take much to run Don't need a beast build to play this game to look nice. PvP and atmospheric GamePlay is quite â¥â¥â¥â¥ing awesome overall- Looking for new members more than glad to help any one out that needs it or just looking to play!!! ARMA 3 is sick
1792	1	a	151 hours of Altis Life. Best 151 hours spent. 10/10 would pick apples again.
349	1	a	Easily my favourite game right now. While there is less content than ARMA 2 right now, BIS is continually adding more. This game is definitely not for your typical CoD kiddy as it takes patience and strategy which all adds into the experience.   The biggest thing for me is that this is a community game. BIS has simply provided a platform where the community makes limitless mods and missions for the user to enjoy. Speaking of mods, THEY ARE AWESOME! Anything from radio mods, to sound mods, to vehicle and weapon additions, and even entire new maps and game mods (there's even a mech warrior mod).  The immersion in this game is great and I would highly reccomend taking the time to join a community. Doing this, you'll gain access to the real ARMA experience and not Atlis Life/Wastelands. Community events are great and there's basically one out there that would suit any player.  Lastly, this game supports multiple control inputs which is a HUGE plus for me. For example I have essentially 5 control inputs: keyboard, mouse, Track IR, joystick/hotas, and steering wheel/pedals. They all work seemlessly together and allow for some really awesome configurations. For example, the pedals are tri-purpose. I use them for the obvious brake and gas while driving but I additionally use them for analogue leaning as infantry and rudder pedals while flying.
3818	1	a	I really enjoy this game, i will admit tho it is alot better with mods installed
3931	1	a	Great game to play with friends
1893	1	a	Great game, lots of fun, bad frames in highly populated servers
2179	1	a	money well spent
868	1	a	Wonderful game, Physics, Tactics. Most realistic shooter on the market #ForSteamBadge
976	1	a	Better then crack but runs like trash...
957	1	a	Arma 3 is a realistic shooter, if your looking for COD type of game this is not it!
2564	1	a	The only problem with arma 3 is... the lack of content. The arma 2 had such a great community and mods and even the game had more guns and armor at the start than arma 3. I just can't understand why devs did not put in stuff like bipods, advanced first aid, helicopter features, portable MG's, and on and on, that arma 2 had. So if you buy arma 3 you get a bit more 'polished' arma, but with the lack of good multiplayer servers and simplicity in game experience. So if you are new to the arma 3 its fine you wont even know what im talking about and go ahead its a great game. But if you were a fan of arma 2 like me, you will just be dissapointed, about the multiplayer content and community pick. And Bohemia Interactive seems to like EA principles of marketing game. Its hilarious that they are trowing out DLC's that enable you so basic thing as a rope hook on a helicopter for 15$! Which it should have already be in the game?! So the final tought is still, a good game but the devs â¥â¥â¥â¥ed it up big time. 6.5/10 So wake up Bohemia and stop being so lazy and dull to the fan base. And if you have to rip people off with DLC's put at least a fair price of 5$ instead of 15$.
1395	1	a	I shot a 120mm round at a guys knee... I never saw him again 10/10 would recommend
4099	1	a	You'll spend more time â¥â¥â¥â¥ing around in the editor than playing the actual game at all! 11/10
472	1	a	Probably one of the best games i've played on steam. First there was the brilliance of Arma 2 and now there is the perfection I call Arma 3. King of the hill is great if you like team based game modes. Altis is fun but hard to get started in and wasteland is fun if you like survival or deathmatch. And just like Arma 2 the community has made amazing mods
1367	1	a	A very big improvement from Arma 3, love playing battle royal fits pefectly with the controls. Might want to have a decent pc to not lag on Arma 3 though. If you liked Arma 2, you will love Arma 3!  GET IT ON SALE!!!!
2942	1	a	Really nice so far.
2255	1	a	Amazing game. Truely unique and majorly realistic. 10 leagues above Battlefield and about 500million leagues above any call of duty game. If a challenge is what you're looking for then the campaign on this game is such a challenge. Even leading your own squad can be a challenege. Almost everything is driveable. Good array of weaponary. And if you play online, it only gets better with Altis life and Breakingpoint. Even Milsim. I recommend you buy this game and support the developers who actually make great games unlike the developers at Activision and Infinity Ward who churn the same garbage out each year.
3819	1	a	Looks like a great game and I have really enjoyed the previous incarnations (still playing ARMA2 Operation Arrowhead) although htere seems to be hardly any scenarios in this version. Certainly I think I prefer the desert scenarios in OA. I would be hard pressed to point out anything major that this game does over OA really. The underwater environment was nothing to write home about really. The people look a little bit better and the sun is better etc but its nothing major. At the moment until more expansions are produced that add more scenarios etc I would recommend getting ARMA2 Combined Operations but this game will be great when filled out a little more.
4191	0	a	i love the game but i had to get a new computter and when i downloaded t to the new one it says ' GAME LAUNCH ERROR GAME EXECUTEABLE NOT FOUND. PLEASE RPAIR THE GAME THROUGH THE STEAM CLIENT.' i have done everything i could find and nothing works...this is BS and a wast of my money.....
307	1	a	Got out of my boat to do a sunken treasure in wasteland, flew 50 feet into the air and got hit by a jet.    10/10 would play again
369	0	a	Dissapointing. The game feels like it's still in Beta stage.
4771	1	a	Like Skyrim but realistic.
2042	1	a	It's pretty yummy if you ask me.
2526	1	a	Add me on steam if you wanna do missions I have a group.
1422	1	a	An Alright game, I recommend ArmA II: Combined operations over this.
123	1	a	all fun and video games until someone hop in the A10 WARTHOG
140	1	a	Don't expect 60 FPS and get ready for the most amazing tactical (or not) sandbox ever. 
4940	1	a	I have a lot to say about this game and not a lot of time to say it.  Soldiers of the future are kinda dumb but the mods make it cool, AI are immune to pain and they can headshot you from the Greek island of Altis all the way to you sitting at your actual computer.  I like RHS, pretty fun. Uhhh, join my milsim unit.
3748	1	a	Without a doubt Arma 3 is worth all the money if not more. I've had my some of best memories in gaming playing this game. There's so much variety in the amount of things you can do. Get bored of Altis Life? Then hop on KoTH. End up being bored with that later too? Well don't worry because Arma is jam packed with tons of content and different game modes to suit your needs. Just to name off a few of the other awesome game modes there's Exile, Domination, Wasteland, Breaking Point, Battle Royale, RPG/Life, etc. And then there's also the in-game editor and scenerarios. Whenever someone asks me if they should buy Arma 3, I always tell them, 'A pc without Arma 3, is like a human without a soul.' Though I would suggest having a mid/high tier build if you're planning to get into Arma 3. It's pretty unoptimized on weaker machines.  Yes you should definetly buy Arma 3, even if you aren't into shooters I'm sure you can find some enjoyment with this game.
1972	1	a	FPS Game without a bomb site
3465	1	a	Great game, full of underwear.
1065	1	a	This my first ever game review so, I'll try my best. Basically, what you get with ARMA is open-world warfare. The size of the maps and locations in ARMA bring it to life more than a simple Call Of Duty Map. The graphics are beautiful and show off the true extent of PC Gaming, Simple things such as the movement of smoke whilst flying through it with a helicopter or jet pay off big time. There is a huge extent of weapons and vehicles to choose from to explore the vast world. Multiplayer is fantastic with there being many 'Altis-Life' servers out there such as EUGL or Darkside Gaming. These online servers give you the oppurtunity to make it big as a drug smuggler or serve Altis in the Police Forces and work your way to higher positons. My only let downs with the game is the driving/flying/boating physics and controls. It definately isn't the best game when it comes to vehicles with the steering feeling delayed and sloppy and the damage can be sometimes, ridiculous. There was a time where I drove a vehilce into a tree at around 10 km/h and it blew up. Then another where I crashed a heli out of the sky and everything was fine besides the rotors.   So to sum up the game, if you are looking for an open-world warfare with a great multiplayer community you should definately give it a go, Even though I have never played this as a single-player game it still gets an Easy 8/10 from me.\\  -HDWizzard
3561	1	a	Not as good as ArmA 2.
4857	1	a	Great to play!
1339	1	a	This is the best military shooter i have ever played. With the option to download and create content from the workshop you have the option to play this game for ever !!   Only downside is the fact that i need to wait for the campaign but hey enough to do until then !  9/10
4248	1	a	it is a cool game i like it =)
3757	1	a	some how i have this game?
269	1	a	If you've looked at this on the Steam shelf and even been slightly interested, buy it.   Apart from the gorgeous graphics and highly detailed soldiers, weapons, vehicles and environments, it gives you an experience like no other shooter.  Best of all, it uses the Steam workshop which means you can very easily download (in-game) scenarios that other players have made. This offers an eternal level of replayability.
2509	1	a	If you like a realistic military experience, this game is a must have! The Alpha release is just as good as the final release of Armed Assault and ArmA II.
1463	1	a	Fun game, all the mods make it so fun to play.
3628	1	a	Best military simulation game out there. Great sandbox with incredible modability and community support. You will find no other game with the same amout of teamplay and immerssion. It suffers from bad performance, occassional bugs, silly physics and semi-acceptable DLC policy.  Strives when played with an organized group. With support of many advanced modifications it shows its full potential.
2948	1	a	If you like Shooting things This is the game for you
1250	1	a	A squeaker bought me this game.
2669	1	a	bought this to play one of the best millatary simulators and get the experience of being a man on the front line. i instead played arma life where i was robbed by two men wearing nothing, became a pimp and even started my own fight club damn broke the 1st rule.  11/10  would pimp again
1215	1	a	Solid game- Very multi purpose Dayz King of the hill Realism And much more! Love it cant love it more unless the DLC WAS FREEE!!!! 
5063	1	a	Greatest slideshow ive ever seen!
2366	1	a	Arma 3 is the most pure PC game in the world. 10/10
1867	1	a	10/10 would play, much fun
2137	1	a	15-60fps on lowest graphics with a GTX 780. Still worth buying.  Edit: It lags mostly in cities and what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ the jungle map runs better than the sandy one!
5276	1	a	Fun, great community, plenty of mods to keep you entertained but this game is expensive, it's a stretch whether it's worth 60$ imo but its very fun Would buy again if it got cheaper
5187	0	a	How can a game of recent years have so bugs?
2058	1	a	Fun for a few hours.
1699	1	a	Another game with alot of opportunity and all that, great mods coming out for it aswell definitely would recommend it's good for the price.
2116	1	a	best milirtary game ever
409	1	a	ArmA 3 is the best war simulation game you can get today. The different multiplayer gamemodes you can play and all the mods thats in this game is insane, especially the RP communities that starting to become a massive thing in the gaming industry.   Even though ArmA 3 is the most realistic and full of gaming potential, it can be quite hard to find a community that you click with, typically you need to find some friends from outside and get them into this too, Then theres the time consume-  which basicly means, if you got a girlfriend that you have to spent time with, you either have to play ArmA 3 together or drop either ArmA or the GF(This is the best choice aha), then theres also the hardware issues. When I started playing ArmA 3 my Geforce Experience program automatically chose Ultra for all the settings, which my PC didn't really enjoy, so I crashed and lagged a lot, so I chose to look into the configs, and saw that it all was on Ultra, so I turned it to medium.(This was with a single GTX-660TI GPU), and now later I have bought 2(SLI) 970. So what have we learned yet?  Bad things 1st. Community play(Singleplayer is boring and etc.) 2nd. Time consuming. 3rd. Hardware issues.  Good things 1st. Awesome experiences with both RP and other kind of gamemodes. 2nd. Meeting people from all over the world, and forming an virtual community. 3rd. A really good solution if you want some competitive realistic war scenarios. 4th. A lot of online users, so you shouldn't worry about not finding a server for your favourite gamemode.  All in all, I find ArmA 3 one of my favourite games, which is why I have chosen to say that I think you should buy this game if you want something realistic and 'fun' but really time consuming.

4203	0	a	UNREFINED AND JERKY -- describes every aspect of this game. Even with the settings turned down the animations are horrible and the guns are garbage - I cant even hit a window on the side of a building. Bohemia needs to take some pointers from other shooters, refine the animations, fix the guns so they actually can shoot someone, and fix the jerky animations and lag so that whopever you shoot at, is not ghosting and jerking around like someone having a seaizure. I wouldnt even call this and Alpha build and this game has been out for years -- NO EXCUSES AT THIS POINT. I want my money back, this game is garbage.

3233	1	a	As long as you like heavy team oriented play (no battlefield doesn't count), then you'll love Arma 3. And if you're the kind of person who likes to sit back from the action and just provide some fire support, maybe artillery, or just bringing soldiers to the front line and going back to base, then there is a role in Arma 3 for you.
3334	1	a	I don't even have the game but it's allowing me to write this.   I win.
1639	1	a	One of the best games I've ever played.
1795	1	a	I just wish I had more time to play this game... the mods are the best part tho  But the M107 with AP rounds its the duck's nutts
3751	1	a	With +900 hours of game time..   It is a game worth having. If you are new to the Arma series, or just Arma 3 in paticular, it is a worth while experience.  With all the mods, different game types, and friends made while playing, it's a game I dont regret buying.
2055	1	a	Haven't played it that much but it seems pretty good...
986	1	a	Probably the best MilSim game i have ever played, 10/10
3130	1	a	Best LIKE REAL gameplay! When you hear bullets pass over---- puts you in a place where you never think you be in.
2027	1	a	i still dont know all the controls
3900	1	a	  This game is my favorite game and I think it always will be changed by the steam workshop.If your looking to buy a game where you can sink more than 1000 hours and still only touch a tiny part of the modding community this game is for you. :)
999	1	a	If you play solo using AI allies against AI enemy this game is a 7/10. BUT with the right mods it quickly becomes an 8/10. Then add in muliplayer, open modding, PVE, PVP, friggin zombies!, a bazillion weapons and equipment, sound packs, then forget that they added gokarts ( I think the devs were on meth the day they came up with that idea ). In my mind you simply cant find any current or past milsim game that can offer anything close to what Arma 3 can.  This isnt your little brothers Call of Duty or Battlefiled, 1 shot can and will kill you thats what the kiddies dont like, but guess what thats real sonny boy.
4659	1	a	all round good game
3974	1	a	It has ISIS now
732	1	a	Very good game  Pros: -Loads of user made missions / content -Loads of servers -Possibility of making your own server -Good graphics  Cons: -Not very optimized -Loads of trolls / hackers around the community -Servers are bad at FPS. You lose a lot of frames  Overall it is a good game but more can be done for the optimization
3796	1	a	Very cool game. Lots of MODs.
4602	1	a	To play this game properly, I highly recommend watching Brandon Buzards Guides on YouTube on how to tweak your PC for higher Performance. Also his video on how to optimize Arma 3 was a huge help. I went from avg. 15-20 FPS to 40-60 FPS. Without these tutorials this game will be hard to enjoy.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LwIfcW0EnY   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sgckg16UC-Y  (They are about 2h but its worth it)
1051	1	a	I recommend being sniped from 800m by 'Mr Yung' and then being told to suck it
288	1	a	Best military simulation game out here. 10/10
3650	1	a	Is nice even at 10fps
3780	1	a	It was ok I guess..
1953	1	a	Had an enemy who was about to steal my truck in the sights of my Sniper I took the shot, only to realise I hadn't zeroed in my scope, and shot out the tire of my own truck instead, whilst alerting the enemy, who proceeded to kill me while verbally assaulting me in Russian 23/10 -Too many tires
176	0	a	This part was written when I had an FX 6300 OCed at 4 Ghz, 8GB ram and an HD 6870: For my current config, look way down below. ------------------------------------------- Operation Flashpoint was good, I bought it three times. Arma was acceptable, I bought it and its addons. Arma 2 was excellent, I bought it twice and I also received it as a gift over Steam.  but frankly, arma 3 is completely disappointing: In 2015-16, Arma series becomes a pay to win with Marksman DLC and APEX addon. In 2035, rocket launchers are utter â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and the art of guidance systems has been completely lost. In 2035, IFVs are going slower than tanks and flips magically for no reasons. In 2035, your occular implants shows you full screen advertisings for having been a passenger in an helicopter that no one cares about, added in a DLC. In 2035, Weapon zeroing is made en masse over advertised values for ammo (ie: if your ammo is made to leave the muzzle at 800ms and actually leaves it at 920(as for the Katiba). then you will definitely not hit your target beyond 500 meters because it will overshoot it. In 2035, AA rockets are tracking the target as soon as they leave the launcher, good luck if the target is going downward because your rocket will go downward too. In 2035, Westland Lynx are equiped with rockets, not guided missiles. In 2035, the Fennek is an MRAP, but on the plus side, the retractable periscope is funny to use. (Obsolete) In 2035, aircrafts and game engines are so badly designed that even if you have above the recommended specifications, you will have 9 FPS. (Obsolete) In 2035, aircrafts and game engines are so badly designed that even if you have above the recommended specifications, you will have 20 FPS, but the players will teleport all the time, shoot before you see ! Also in 2035, every soldier is the fattest America, Greece, or Iran has to offer and can run for 2 meters provided you are not carrying anything heavy, like a weapon. In 2035, players will be so stupid that you will want to kill them all, even your teammates, because they will join the strongest teams. In 2035, AA radars are the most useless stuff ever created, only usefull for single targets, and on the ground, what happened to the Operation Flashpoint scanner ? In 2035 you will finally be able to go underwater, too bad there is nothing to do there. and finally: in 2035, you can forget about usefull vehicles, here MRAPS do not have AT launchers, and AA tanks have a ridiculously short range, bad accuracy, useless radar, and only 4 rockets which MAY allow you to shoot down one helicopter hovering and not using countermeasures.  In short: the future SUCKS.   for the record I had 976 hours of play time on arma 3 at the time I wrote this (now 1200-ish). This number is still bound to increment, but I can not recommend the game for anyone until they fix their engine, and the future.  Edit: I will be nice for once: The ballistic system is a nice addition to Arma. sorry I ran out of nice things to say. Yet another edit: If modding the game was not such a pain in the â¥â¥â¥, and if Bohemia did not RELY on modders to make their game for them, I would probably recommend it. Of course that means modding it is a pain in the â¥â¥â¥ (unless you are creating everything from scratch, which means you can make everything and as such should not bother with this engine) and that I do not recommend it.  A word for JPS2004308 who commented this rant: How does that apply to what I said ? Also I would very much like to point out to everyone here that you copied / pasted your comment to all negative reviews of arma 3.  With an I-5 6600K OCed 4.4Ghz, 16GB ram, SSD drive and an noisy RX 480: -------------------------------------------------------------- At last ! This game runs smoothly (it is way less of a torture to play, jumped from 9 to 70 FPS and my view distance is 7.5km instead of 3km(1km with 19 FPS).  -------------------------------THE APEX RANT: I have to point out if BI wanted *me* to buy the APEX add-on, they should have never dropped those utterly crappy DLCs on the market first. I am sure the new map will be gorgeous and fun to play.  As I said I did not buy it and now the main menu changed, with almost every sub section containing an APEX related link that will *invite you* to buy it. Now if you launch the editor, you will be able to place *APEX UNITS* that you cannot use, which obvioulsy clutters your UI, Same thing about ZEUS. And if you look closely, APEX equipment, even when it is just a retexture of a piece of gear you already have access to (jungle camo version of X weapon), you will not be able to use it, a chasm between APEX and non-APEX in multiplayer, if you want your enemies not to be able to use your weapon, just get APEX. Oh and far worse: two pieces of gear are way tougher than the A3 equipment. If you want to be invincible in multiplayer: Take the Viper helmet (Special purpose helmet of the CSAT) and the Special purpose uniform. those two are way more effective than the former CSAT uniform, to crown it all take a GA Carrier GL Rig, and enjoy your walking tank which is something like 30% more resilient than the former possible walking tank (Defender Helmet + GA carrier rig + CSAT fatigues).  So yes, they are turning the game into a Pay to Win and this since Marksman DLC. ----------------------------------------------------------------- To be honest if you want to really enjoy A3, go find the ACE3 mod first. For some very strange reason they are the ones who, in my opinion, bohemia should hire. Yes, you can stick with ACE2 and arma2 if you are intelligent, but ACE3 corrects a lot of the 'future sucks' I wrote above, it seems though they have decided to not take in account the date of 2035 and stuck with what they know to be currently true. While it seems retrograde, it turns out to be way more futuristic than what bohemia did: At least Titan rockets can make top attacks now. And for those of you who like to be even more of a danger to your teammates, there is a dead man's switch, and the ability to strap explosives on your vehicle (or the enemy's). Also insert here some nice comment about the RHS mod, but to be honest I expected no less from those guys. Go download it instead of buying APEX, it is free and it is good.   -----------------------The 'Did you find this review helpful' rant: Okay so people around find reviews 'not helpful', for some reasons there are more 'unhelpful reviews' not recommending this game than there are recommending it (basically I am pretty sure that if I pressed the 'recommend' button people would find this review more helpful). THINK A BIT you pieces of trash fanboys, what you are doing (Saying 'no') makes negative reviews having more weight than positive ones, the only problem with that being steam forcing people to show only negative reviews to see them. A not helpful review could be some random comment or inside joke as there are many around. An helpful review points out what is wrong or what could be improved. Get a brain at your local Red Burger shop.
4446	1	a	joined a Wasteland and spawned. ran up a stairway and died. 10/10 would die on stairs again
2138	1	a	the game is the best game i ever played. just keep on going!
1709	1	a	Don't really like the sound, but other than that, like they say, men play Arma. Each mission is different and you never know whats going to happen, but as you train, everything becomes muscle memory and you respond approprately. There's always space for improvement. Love this simulator.
1753	1	a	PTSD simulator 2016 I cannot hear buzzing sounds anymore without thinking of an A-164 firing a gatling gun at my unit.
2558	1	a	so much to offer. a must get if into simulation what so ever.
3282	1	a	If you have a Pc that can run this game at atleast medium settings 30fps. Best 60$ you have ever spent.
4199	0	a	Arma 3 DLC the game
775	1	a	Great game overall ! Try it out if you haven't yet !
2427	1	a	Found a tank Killed a naked guy Made millions :D
4742	1	a	joins server 10 fps to 30 then i get shot 10/10
1532	1	a	This game is amazing, so far its the best game all around I have played. It has amazing graphics, lots of differant simulations, and endless replay value. The main campaign is not part of the game at launch, but is a free DLC in 3 differant installments.  The fact you can play this game in first or third person, increases the amount of people this game can apeal to.   The learning curve is a little rough, but after a few times running around doing missions or just playing around, its super easy to pick up.  AGAIN graphics, A++ if you dont have this game yet, its worth the money, I got the game during alpha, I got one for my wife in Beta, and now the full games out, and it just blows alpha and beta away with how amazing the game turned out to be.  
443	1	a	I highly recomend this games for those ones who like simulation shooters, you have thousands of game modes such as altis life, wasteland, the campaign, etc etc. The oportunities in this games are infinites, BUT the game is not really well optimized so if you wanna play fine you will have to use a good pc.
1266	0	a	Not worth $60 gets boring and controls and very hard and the game is hard to play with people.
1684	1	a	Great game, wonderful developers, plenty of mod support, would recommend, best Military Simulation I've ever played.
4846	1	a	You can fight wiithout pants! my gawd best game ever 79 fishsticks out of 56 cakes
5391	0	a	This is not a good game  It's still not optimized enough to run over 60fps on KoTH on my rig (8GB 1333mhz RAM, GTX760, i5 3570k, win10)  
2488	1	a	By far one of my favourite games!  I've been playing Arma since the good ol' OFP series and have truly enjoyed each new addition to the Armaverse. That being said, the game, and series, are not without its faults. Luckily the faults are often overshadowed by the large modding community which, in my opinion, is one of the best communities out there. Kudos to the devs for creating a game that encourages modding. If it's not in the game yet, you can be almost certain, that someone will mod it in.  If you like milsim, or just want to upgrade to something more tactical and realistic than the COD or BF-series, well give Arma a try. Initially the game might seem confusing, but with the introduction of Bootcamp, new players are guided through the basics of the game, and get a chance to test their skills, before taking on the full Arma experience.  A lot of players play the games single player campaign before embarking on what truly makes Arma great, the multiplayer experience. You'll find a large number of Arma groups, all looking for new members, and no matter what you prefer, be it Marines, Special Forces or Insurgents, there's bound to be a group for you too.  Some of the drawbacks about Arma 3 is, that it's set in a not to distant future, and thus the developers have chosen to 'futurefy' the units and vehicles. Some like it, some don't. In previous installations of Arma, the conflict areas somewhat resembled ongoing conflict areas in the real world, whereas in A3 the conflict initially takes place in the Mediterranean, and covers a conflict between CSAT (Iran and others) and NATO. The island of Altis does look great though, and offers plenty of space for combined warfare. If anything it lacks a bit of forest.  One of the higlights of the game, to me, is the editor. Anyone who's played with LEGO as a child will love the editor. It gives you the chance to create your own missions, and the possibilities seem endless, from the easy and short missions, to the vastly complex ones that require a good amount of scripting. Arma has it all! Plus, with Eden coming along, the editor is about to get even more awesome. A full featured 3D editor, so no more guessing if you've placed the units at the correct spot, or if they're facing the right window etc., Eden delivers big time improvements over the 'classic' 2D editor.  Now I could go on for ages with this review, but essentially here are my thoughts on the game, if you're thinking of buying it.  Buy it: - If you like to play in a more tactical manner than COD/BF - If you like being a part of a massive community, where something new is always being modded in - If you can live with some of the small errors and restrictions by the game-engine, and realizing that the game is under constant development - If you like large scale combined warfare - If you have ever played with LEGO and enjoy creating stuff - If you're looking to get into an Arma group and anjoying the MP community - If you want a game that you can play for ages  Don't buy it: - If you think it's anything like COD/BF/CS:GO - If you think you'll learn the game in 30 minutes - If you can't live with AI that sometimes is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ - If you have a low spec PC (Arma is horrendously optimized, as of yet, and your FPS WILL drop)
4582	1	a	Most if not all reviews of this game took place before they had a campaign, workshop support, and Zeus. I love this game... Thats all i have to say.
1982	1	a	The moments you can have in this game are unbelievable. This game makes your heart beat go to a million in 1 second. The tense and amazing times you have with friends or strangers is truley a game you need to have in your Steam Libary. Also the graphics in this game is astonishing, even if you dont like the simulated war game anybody with a beast PC should have his game because of the amount of detail put in Arma 3 is a game to sit back and watch the view.
1783	1	a	army shoot man game  vary good game  i recommend buy
2629	1	a	IT IS AN AWESOME GAME I WOULD KILL FOR IT
1243	1	a	Arma 3 is simply the best combat simulator there is. and if you're playing alone or with friends, the game is fun either way.
4735	1	a	Fantastic sim/game. Learning curve is fairly small and incredably rewarding! If you like action games, blowing sh!t up, team work, driving, flying and diving! Then this is probably the best game out there!
1209	1	a	100/10 would â¥â¥â¥â¥ buy again
3678	1	a	I hate this game so much, and I love it in the same time. :)
5420	1	a	I hit a jump and randomly catapulted 1km in the sky, then got taken out by an anti air missile.  â¥â¥â¥â¥ing 10/10
3286	1	a	See youtube videos. Buy game. Join server. Shot from 3000m 10/10
1549	1	a	Meh. It's okay.
4200	0	a	It took them far too long to polish this turd for me to recomend anything BIS is involved with. Yeah the game is ok now that they have finally added the features that should have been there from day dot, but I bought a physical copy of the DELUXE EDITION from EB and as such i expected a FINISHED GAME, not the Alpha/Beta i was confronted with. It should never have been on shelves 6 months ago let alone when i bought it back in 2013. And you would think DELUXE EDITION implies that at least *some* of the DLC would be included. Nope. Not so'DELUXE' then is it?  Imagine buying a new car, and on your way out of the dealership the shady salesman casualy states 'Oh just so you know even though you have a dashboard, none of the dials or switches work. But as soon as we get some in we can install them for a nominal fee'. Seems a bit rude dosen't it? paying for something and realizing it dosen't even come close to expectations.   And the excuse 'why not just use mods' is just a sad way of admiting the game isn't finished and/or it isn't any good on its own. And even though i may pick it back up and try again i really don't see myself spending anywhere near the time i had intended to as the experience has left a VERY bitter taste in my mouth.  YEARS Later............  2016 and it's still an unoptimized hot mess with the dubious choice of overpriced pointless DLC like go karts or constant ads to buy said DLC should you pick up or use the wrong item. And now most people would rather role play as 'cops and robbers' (d1ckhe@ds and dealers) than play the game as a mil sim. This isn't arma, it's the bloody sims with guns and as fun as that sounds, it is not. It's still a big 'nah i'll be right' to this game from me.
4770	1	a	Arma 3 is an interesting game with all the god awful driving physics for the trucks... But hey! let's get past that one con. Arma 3 in general is a frun game, But when you have friends that play it, when i first bought Arma 3 i played scenarios and got bored as hell in ten seconds flat, but when you really get into it and start playing Altis Life and make a gang with your friends and do all that kind of stuf like my friends and i do all the drug dealing, it really hits how the fun this game is, and how pretty it is depsite the driving physics.... 8/10 realy fun game  Pros: Gameplay Altis Life Online Multiplayer  Cons: Physics Single PLayer
5209	1	a	The best sandboxes out there
1277	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥
239	1	a	Arma Altis Life and City Life = No Social Life. kek Top mods in this game.
1582	1	a	Strongly recommanded game. Especially when you do roleplay everyone seems serious about it and it makes it more fun. And i love that you are allowed to do everything you want like riding huge aircraft and stuffs..!
4131	1	a	The most poorly-optimized PTSD simulator!!!
5170	1	a	like am relly a sowjer, gunz an tankz anss then big asplowshunz
5406	0	a	I decided to try Arma 3 as everyone was recommending online.I am going to start out with this game does need some work to be put in not worth to spend full price on this pick up when on a good sale other then that this game isn't for people who like fast paced action now performance issues I apperently run into with other complications. Firstly so I got 20 fps everything maxed to lowered it still some 20fps terrible port needs to be compressed properly controls are also clunky I would say the simulation at the start was 60fps but once it ended fps dropped drasticaly. Secondly I would recommend trying to run with a single GTX 980 &amp; 970 or AMD equevelent never crossfire or SLI not responsible if fps will stay the same usually I get over 60fps maxed out in games but this one you probably should use a controler since it's not K&amp;m friendly. Lastly lets not forget the story you run to point A to B. I know it's supposed to be realistic but we customers need playable material this rant is to prove that servers have connection problems sometimes you get kicked from online most of the time I get messages saying Arma 3 stopped working as I play through don't get this garbage unless this is below $10/7.89 EU or $5/3.95 EU please Bohemia Interactive fix this trash and make it playable.People with 770s,780s,and 280s,and 290s are really dissapointed that this game doesn't run well on their machines an utter dissapointment to people who dedicated their money on powerful pc hardware just to have 20 fps? In summary not worth buying this game since it isn't demanding but more unoptimized unfinished product this is a spit on PC Gamers and their rigs and before you say something to defend early access let me tell you something Valve needs to work on testing this games before letting them be published on steam conclusion don't buy it not worth your time unless you like capped down ports then support the video game monkeys who make video games this bad and horrible.   Final rating 5.5/10 for Walking Simulator
2540	1	a	its worth a try :D
3003	1	a	Arma 3, where do I start?   This game is the definition of realistic.   This game is the definition of freedom.   And why is it?  As you might've noticed, this is not a linear campaign shooter like Call of Duty, or Battlefield. This is the game, where you have two gigantic maps (soon a third, but as a DLC). In the base game, you ofcourse have your campaigns and all, but when the game really shines, is with its multiplayer and modding community.  In my entirety of my life, have I never seen this many mods and custom campaigns, etc. in a single game, as I have in Arma 3. It's excellent, and gives you a large variety of options on how to play. From procedurally generated open maps with the freedom of choice where to go, to the more linear - yet awesome campaigns. There's new weapons, new vehicles, even entirely new maps for you to download for free, using the Steam Workshop.  Now, about the multiplayer. When you open up your browser, you'll see a lot of the same game modes. It's a shame that there's only a few select game modes, which really made it through with Arma 3, as I remember Arma 2 had some different and awesome game modes which Arma 3 lacks. Now, if you just want to play with your friends, go ahead and create a server. You can even play with mods, and all of that custom content you've downloaded (this includes game modes, maps, etc.) to keep it fresh for you.  Now that I've talked about the good, let's talk about the bad.  The game suffers heavily from bad optimization. Now, I'm not running a monster rig, but with a GTX 770, I'm able to run every game with relative graphics. My graphics settings in Arma 3 actually don't matter that much, as my FPS remains around the same, even if I select everything on the lowest, or on ultra. If you don't have a powerful computer, or just a mid-range like me, you're in for a really bad time, and should upgrade your PC before attempting to play this game.  To be honest, I'd love to see newer vehicles and weapons from Arma 3, as most of them are wayy outdated by now. Ofcourse there's the mods, but there's not mods for every single thing.   All in all, this is a must-have if you're into military shooters (and have a good rig).
2305	1	a	Well, after a few hundred hours, I can say I love this game. Even though the price is steap (after 2 years), and the learning curb is huge, the game is fun. Once you get used to the performance of the game, you learn to deal with the other bugs. The community is great, and most are 14+. I'd highly recommend this game to anyone who likes realism and real punishment for failure. 9/10
381	0	a	So I played this game when it was free for 3 days and I only played it for a little while. First of all the game was not very well optimized and I found it to be pretty laggy especially in multilipayer with around 50 people playing and bullets and missles going everywhere. I thought that this was a really releastic game becuase of just how many people there are in a game and how its like a big fire fight. I would have to say for people who have lots of money to spend on games, go ahead and buy it if you have a gaming machiene that can handle this game and get playable frame rates. (Recommend an $1000 PC Minimum) But if you play free games like me and don't have an extreme PC build I don't really recommend the game that much.
2972	1	a	At first the pizza was good. But then I kept eating it, and I found a â¥â¥â¥â¥ING olive on my pizza.
1959	1	a	This game is a very great Game!  It's definitly worth the money!   Pros:
1821	1	a	I've played it a couple times, not bad.
3883	1	a	This Game is the best thing I have ever played in my life. It is so awesome.All the mods and workshop iteams. This game Has so many things to do.  Here is a small list  - arma 3 life - Battle royal - Wastland - Breaking point - Epoch  I really recomend this game.
1007	1	a	Like most of the reviews of this game on steam, this games first 30 hours will be the most painfull time spent trying to learn the basics. With that in mind, I highly recomend this game to those who played the first two games in the ARMA serise. While the learning curve for the game may take some new players days to learn, it is a game that can not truly be judged by how difficult it can be. When first getting into a game you will realize that the games controls can be extreamly difficult to learn, but upon playing for 30+ hours, you will learn all of the in and outs of the complex controls. Many would be quick to assume that this is just like any ordenary shooter were you run to one objective to the next shooting everything in your path, In ARMA 3 this is simpily not the case. Getting into your first only match you will realize that there will be some situations that may take you 10 minutes of sitting there and waiting for the enemy to make the first move. Needless to say this game is extreamy hardcore, and should be part of your library if you enjoy stratigic games that require communication with other people to win.  What is good: Graphics Gameplay Online Gameplay Community  What Sucks: Learning curve Server-Side lag Large system requirments  My Score- 87/100  -A must buy for those who love stratigic 1st/3rd person shooters.  - 170hrs of playtime at time of review.   
1190	1	a	it's arma.
3350	1	a	I will quote a good friend of mine;  'Steam winter sale FTW. ARMA is 50% off again - which makes it priced about right given the â¥â¥â¥â¥ery required to make it work all snazzy.'  Best Arma review ever. If you can run the gauntlet, this game is brilliant. If you expect to download something, and have it work, best wait awhile. 
980	1	a	Arma 3 is an absolutely amazing game. Some servers can be laggy but that is not the games fault. It is such a good game with many things to do and the graphics are amazing its just like real life (in a way) Arma 3 is amazing.
3970	1	a	*****
3038	1	a	Great Game With Amazing Gamemodes!  Fun with friends and single. I bought this game and never had regrets.  Fun, Thrilling &amp; Worth It!
3753	1	a	Awesome game, only requires a good pc.
1473	1	a	great fun. make sure u have friends to paly with ;)
942	1	a	love it really good game
3621	1	a	I started playing this game today and when I first joined I knew I was gonna love the game 1st off if you like to Roleplay or maybe get into some hardcore PVP then this is the game for you. Why not hop down to the PD and sign up for a job to earn some money for you and your gang! Trust me this is definitely worth the money! Good luck to everyone! Hope this helped. Peace -Nathan
4458	1	a	Good but wish there were way more planes
3630	1	a	Still the bomb.
3087	1	a	War is fought by soldiers not the gun, it is fought by a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing tank coming down a road while you have you're pistol of doom. Ps no pants have been harmed in the making of this game
5026	0	a	After playing this game for a while, the dlc comes and the game still has horrible lag and bug issues.... They do not support the main mods for this game that actually keep the game alive. After about 2 years I have seen little improvement just more money dlc. Some of the glitchy deaths bugs have been around since Arma 2.. I would not buy at full price.. I bought this in alpha, and apparently it is still in alpha 
4147	1	a	This game... Is a rollercoaster.. There's parts you will really enjoy then there's parts you wont enjoy. This is a war simulator, not like any cod or bf game you would get. What it means is it involves a lot of running, traveling and it may require a lot of patience. It is almost 90 % traveling and what it does is it makes the 10 % worth it because when you have traveled or ran for a long long time then you wont really be prepered for combat too much. Even though its almost just a walking/running sim or just a waiting sim, when something really does happen you wont be prepered too much and that makes it really thrilling. Not only wont you be as prepered as if you had ran for 40 ft and then gotten shot at, killed them, ran another 40 ft and getting shot at. There's even a pretty good single player you can play for hours. The most popular thing i would assume is the multiplayer and that is because a the single player is mostly scripted and you can go through it over and over and know what to expect. While multiplayer is diffrent because you can walk somewhere, get killed one time, walk to the same place, get killed again then walk there again and not get killed. (Its not actually like that sometimes.) It's a game that has a BIG focus on strategy, teamwork and resourses.   Would i recommend this game? Yes. Thats just my formal opinion. This is a game you will most likely either love or hate. Before you decide get more into the game because its not just all of the same. It's one of those unike games you are likely to RARELY see.
5204	0	a	If you dont plan on geting dlcs then you will play demo not a full game :)
4364	1	a	so uh. a3 right? you have a good computer? aight. you have some patience? aight. get the game and download 25 gb and then download another 5~10 gb to play exile. play exile - find a way to force yourself through wooden and steel walls and eventually cause a major update in exile. play exile more - find a way to make yourself invisible and kill the entire server from 5000+ meters away because youre sitting in the back of a lada on everyone elses screen, eventually cause a major update to exile. play exile even more - find a way to make mad money by duplicating literally 20,000 weapon supressors, and sell them using an autoclicker and your amazing skill at being afk. the autoclicker crashes the server and kicks everyone (but you). the server goes down for 5 days - causes another major exile update.  in my time playing a3 + exile i feel like ive helped the community a lot by breaking â¥â¥â¥â¥. youre welcome.
303	0	a	Just don't buy this game, horrible ui, horrible optimization, lack of post processing, commanding troops is a huge pain they dont think for themselves you have to micro manage everything if you can even get them to follow your commands at all. Once they are under attack they refuse to move quickly, usually the down fall of my squad. They get shot at then just lay down and i scream at them to get for cover and they will go, just reaaaaally slowly making there way there, standing up then laying down again. Its riddle with bugs. Please don't support bohemia, they dont even care to fix there â¥â¥â¥â¥. They have been using the same engine for a decade, literally,   Even with a beast of a computer arma will not utilize i properly ending. Good luck getting on a servre cause they are way laggier then just single player.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDMdzwanxnY   Just please, don't buy this game. Just don't.
1640	1	a	Give it about a 8.5/10 all the servers are good especially Altis Life, the campaign is good, a bit hard though. Alot of the servers has â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s running them, but what game will you go to that doesn't. Although, great game.
512	1	a	This game never got old ... its evolving all the time
4034	1	a	It's like a 1000 games in one
2803	1	a	Great game
5324	0	a	HOW TO KILL TANKS THE SIMULATION WAY: Walk against them and they will flip.  The game where you can't even play the tutorial mission because of broken scripts (restarted 3 times, the third time my character even had a different voice)  Want a game where you can survive more headshots than in Call of Duty? Then this game is for you. It's the future. Your helicopter can actually land on enemy soldiers without them seeing it! That's the stealth we need. Enemy AI only shoots you since it knows the game is won for them then.   What's the difference between glass windows and mountains? We will never know. AI will shoot right through it. Oh well, you can't kill them trough glass windows! Just like in real life.   This is actually the least realistic game I have ever played in my whole life. But no one plays it for it's military aspects anyway - Arma 3 Altis Life is where all the players sit. (because this military sim is oh-so-realistic.)  Fanbase in this game, or should I say fanboys, are incapable of understanding what this game is supposed to be anyway. Do you believe all the 12 year old veterans? Hell yeah.   I do like the fact that this game has an editor, even if it's quite horrible compared to the other games featuring an editor.  The developer also doesn't care anything about this game. My tank literally explodes from driving against a fence at 5 kp/h. Just like in real life!   The other only positive aspect I can think of are the graphics, which are very nice. And no my friends, the graphics aren't badly optimized, it's the scripts, which basically are the only things that this game has.  1/10. Can't rate it better for what it's supposed to be, especially not when compared to other games.
4467	1	a	I laughed, I cried, I shot people in the face....
5169	0	a	ever since i played operation flashpoint, and fell in love with the RTS , you could build a base and then send tanks to kill your opponents base or fly a jet or helicopter to do it personally, the weapons were realistic damage wise which I never see, the idea was amazing but it was buggy I couldnt wait for the sequel that would straighten them out, op flash 2 was a dud. then I heard of the first arma, and again my hopes were lifted. But again I was disappointed. then I bought arma 2 and again was disapointed mainly by empty servers for both 1 and 2. now I see good reviews on Arma 3, and I cant imagine who is giving them since arma 1 and 2 had hardly a soul actually playing, I refuse to be disappointed again.  Also the AA was so overpowered that there was no way you could destroy a base with a jet or helicopter, youd be instantly shot down, super bummer.
5355	0	a	Do you like headaches? this game is headache game
4076	1	a	10/10 game woth the money
1813	1	a	Good Game but the Engine is unmatured. This game runs on my Pc with 30-40 FPS. PC: AMD FX6300 3,5 Ghz 8Gb RAM Nvidia GTX 660 Arma needs a new Engine then is Arma perfect. I call a few Pros and Cons:  Â°Good Gameplay Â°many vehicles Â°many Weapons Â°a very big Map (over 22km) Â°the Multiplayer is amazing Â°Fun is endless in this Game ________________________ -Bad Engine(FPS Drops) -too many Bugs  9/10 Points
3000	1	a	Realism above all else.   Arma 3 asks a lot of its players, but rewards them well.
1011	1	a	Arma 3 is a great millatry simulator it is very in depth and i had a lot of fun with this game! One of the things that was a buying point for me was Altis Life it is a gamemode like cops and roobers where you can do anything from smugle drugs acrros the border to stealing cars or robbing the bank! However The main point that i like the most is how you can acoplish your objective in your own way for the campaign and the multiplayer, you want to go in head first guns balzing you can, you want to go with a stealty helicpoter insercion and some sniper support you can. This is hands down one of the best millitary simulators, and i strongly recomend this game!
3399	1	a	Hello, Very Good game if into Simulation and also it relates very well to real life, This game Is very mod flexible and there have been alot of mod releases latley e.g. Arma 3life Milsin units and all of that sort of stuff that takes the modding cabablilties very far with this game
5189	0	a	if you like a game full of bugs and major server lag then this game is for you! no matter how good your pc is do not expect anything above 30fps. This is another very poorly optimized pc game. Also its another one of those games that you HAVE to buy DLCs or you will not find anyone to play with.
3190	1	a	Great game. Great dlc. Best running simulator 2k16 and beyond. Mods for this game are great aswell
1815	1	a	this game is just the best game that there is out there. If you feel like roleplaying you can go on altis life. wanna roleplay more go on life mod. want to kill people play king of the hill or wasteland. want to survive and kill people play dayz mod or excile mod
322	1	a	Absolutely love this game. Best simulation game I have played in a long time. So happy I found it!
4797	1	a	This game is nice, I like vac, I like vac bans. I â¥â¥â¥â¥ yo sister in bed, she number 1 prostitue in kazakhstan!
3007	1	a	this game is just epic. just a epic war with so many mods, weapons and vehicles. the graphics are awesome and you can play with friends and make fun
361	1	a	This is sandox taken to a new scale. This is the tropical beach that makes other would be 'sandbox' games seem like a pile of dirt in a schoolyard.
4055	1	a	I remember seeing screenshots of Arma 1 and thinking 'Wow, this game must keep me entertained for months', but after obtaining it I quickly changed my mind and thought what a buggy piece of crap this is, me being a somewhat casual gamer back then. The game was a total disaster to me and made me think 'How could they even call this a game?' The best part were the voice commands. Move. To. That. Building. At.. SIX O'CLOCK! Not to mention the game ran like crap. (Only arma players know what crap means.) (This was obviously ~6 years ago, so I was a bit younger then aswell)  Well, I had a friend in xFire who I shared a similar fate with, but for some reason we decided to try it out together anyway. What we did was the sample Seize the area -mission that you can automatically create from the editor. Suddenly the game wasn't so bad after all. Everything that it lacked in the usual things you have in FPS games it gained back in gameplay and the complexity of the game. Suddenly the trademark buggyness and clumsyness of the engine (which is still present) was a feature instead of a problem. We played it for about 60 hours straight after that, downloading mods, missions and whatnot.  Then came Arma 2. Being a moneyless kid I was, I couldn't buy it. So we tried different cracks, playing through hamachi LAN with the same CD-Key and whatnot, but got beaten by the anti-crack software it had built in. Now you might think that's cause of our amateurism, but really it was cause nobody played the game back then and nobody could create working cracks. Literally, there was maybe 1000 players around the world who had bought the game. Eventually I managed to buy the game and spent countless hours on it until it was time to put it on the shelf.  And then, maybe two years later, came DayZ and probably a million more players cause of it.  Suddenly there were keygens, cracks.. - whatever you needed to bypass the protection. Also, the mainstream gamer had found out what kind of possibilites the Arma engine can provide (dayz being the example). This was something the game developers deserved for putting so much effort to the series.  And now, cause of this success, Arma 3 is here. It's basically Arma 1 and 2 with a bigger budget. I wouldn't have ever thought during my Arma 1 days that it would ever get this popular.   What Arma 3 features: - Excellent graphics - The most realistic military simulation there is - Huge map - Good modability: This has always been a strong point in the series, just check Armaholic and steam workshop and you'll find all sorts of things for your liking. - Possibility to design scenarios with endless different ways: Want a mission where you have to sneak through enemy lines and assasinate an officer? You got it. - Excellent co-op gameplay. - Trademark clumsyness to a lot of things, which will become a feature once you get used to it.  But.. if you're a codfag; you need to give the game some time. It's not your usual casual FPS where everything is scripted and whatnot. And get someone to play with.
3641	1	a	After playing hours and hours of Arma i still think its a great game. The modding community really keeps it alive.
2894	1	a	It's just really good.
3961	1	a	Amazing 3rd or 1st person shooter that has a very realistic feel (aka simulator) hard to get bored with all the user created content and the editor. The controls can be a tad tough to learn at first but with in a few hours you should have them down. Being able to mod your game file gives you tons of customizable things to do. I would recomend playing with a group of people because playing this game by yourself can tend to get boring. That is the only flaw iv been able to find really aside from a few random bugs here and there.
2780	1	a	I Have over 1100 hours on record with this game since Early Access.  The game has become much more user friendly since coming out, if you want a casual to all the way hardcore MILSIM experience, look no further.  Pro's: Huge Scale  Gorgeous visuals  Large selection of weapons  Realistic Ballistics, physics, damage implementation for various calibers, realistic Flight model including but not limited too advanced flight model implementation such as stalls, vortex ring state, damaged instrument panels and etc.  Welcoming community  Insane amount of free mods and maps (Including weapons, textures, sounds for weapons such as DragonFyre sound mod and etc..)  Tutorials that actually teach you how to play and how to not only react to contact and ambushes but also teaches you how to team play as part of a larger assault element and also combined arms (Ever wanted to be in the big boy army and participate in a large scale attack? look no further).  Good single Player Campaign.  Con's  Can still have a steep learning curve, mission making takes practice, more advanced missions scripting requires a decent concept of game script writing  Very very un-optimized for current Gen CPU's. Single thread performance only, can be resource intensive, recommend a i7 CPU for decent game play, takes a beast of a rig to run with everything maxed out in multiplayer (FPS in multiplayer is based off server side FPS and NOT client side aka your PC FPS, hence even powerful pc's can get stutter in large scale multiplayer games).  Can get pretty big in size if you subscribe to a large number of mods  Some mods can interfere with others.  TL:DR Since coming out Arma 3 has become much easier to learn and grasp with new and improved tutorials and scenarios, amazing mod support and close knit community help overcome and issues with this game such as optimization issues and map creation tools. If you do get this game, highly recommend finding a MILSIM unit and or group of players to help guide you in starting out in this game.  My Rig Specs for playing this game (At 1920x1080 with 2x FXAA and view distance of 2500 meters)  i7 3770k Over clocked too 4.1 Ghz 16GB DDR3 10600 RAM EvGA GTX 970 Superclocked (OC 100mhz GPU, 500Mhz Memory) Samsung 840 Pro SSD Windows 10 64bit
4966	1	a	cool
3603	1	a	Very nice game if u play coop
958	1	a	I'm a person who doesn't really love the FPS genre, I always looked at games like COD and was wondering, why do people keep playing that?  ... I still have no idea, but what I do know is that Arma is one of kind game. It's realism and gameplay just took me away. Its huge beautiful maps are like a gigantic playground, that one you always wished, when you were little.  Anyways this game became one of my favorite games in about 3 weeks time, and I can't stop!  Thank you developers, thank you modders, and ofcourse thank yoy community, for making this game such a great one!  
1613	1	a	Loved it!
4462	1	a	this game took away all my downstairs hair
906	1	a	Very awesome game, simulates how war is very well, If you liked Arma 2, you will love this. You can play online such as Wasteland which is fun. I've had this game since they released it.
5015	1	a	A very good game. Admittedly I haven't played it very much since Counter Strike took me and didn't let go. However, if you are looking for a good military simulator game with a intresting campaign and fantastic multiplayer, this is it. Play PlayerUnknowns battle royale, it is a classic and where I have spent ~75% of my play time.
5297	1	a	Having fun playing CityLifeRPG look it up  http://community.cityliferpg.com/ 
573	1	a	The main reason why I bought Arma3 was for the Wasteland mod. I played Arma 2 pretty heavily and I can say for sure that Arma3/Wasteland is far superior than DayZ in every respect except for survival/foraging. I played quite a bit of Arma2 Dayz and I feel that the mod is extremely overrated compared to the other MP experiences Arma has to offer.  This review may be more helpful to those who are thinking about the decision to move to Arma3 from Arma2.  Arma 3 improves upon Arma 2 in many ways. First it reduces the amount of clutter on the keyboard. Now there isn't (what feels like) fifty keys dedicated to command/radio and now there is more of a streamlined feel to the game. That being said, it's extremely necessary to play with voice, as calling out targets/orders is something that is required in this game, unless you are a lone wolf or you are in a rather large group where the need for such things is lessened.  Also, a major update in graphics, which I must say are stunning compared to A2. This doesn't make Arma, but it helps you stay immersed. Needless to say, Arma will  always  be unoptimized, so please, learn simple optimization tricks before giving up after seeing you have &lt;30 frames. It's worth it.  The amount of customizations in this game is extremely helpful/useful. Be warned though, it may take some time before you get the hang of it as Arma, being buggy, has a tendency to make things hard. Plus there's the fact that sometimes a player can get their hands on a fantastic sniper rifle, minus the scope (I'm pointing at you wasteland). So be warned of these situations before you find yourself in one that isn't to your liking.  After all of this I would suggest that people with lower end computers don't buy this game or be prepared to run it on low settings. But the low settings are nothing to be mad about, as they are still pretty damn good, and graphics are not something that you come to Arma for in the first place.   Now for those who haven't experienced the Military Sim feels (you know what I'm talking about)... Arma. Delivers. When played right, it delivers a deep comradery that cannot be gotten from most other games on the market. When you achieve something with your friends, who you sometimes have to place 100% trust in, it can be awe inspiring and can lead to many ecstatic shouts over the radio for doing something seemingly insignificant if seen through eyes of a standard FPS player.  Now about gameplay; Arma requires an extreme amount of patience. Normally you have one or two rounds of fire to get things right or you will be sent to the death screen. Bullets hurt. Really bad. Normally getting hit with one is life threatening if it's normal caliber, but any more than that and you could be facing a bit of a journey back. This normally means 10-20 minutes to regroup and find another battle worth fighting. But don't worry, many of my fondest memories of Arma are from moments that are just random and unexpected, and they don't even require the slightest trace of enemy presence. (  http://i.imgur.com/GgapTFX.jpg  ) &lt;- From Arma2   TL;DR Arma 3 is a much improved upon Arma 2, nothing extremely new here but there's still quite a bit more which makes it worth getting if your computer can handle the game and you can handle the buggyness/playstyle of Arma. It is one of my favorite games and is the leader of its genre, and rightfully so.  For those wondering approximately 300 hours of game time logged on Arma2.
259	1	a	I picked this game up when it first came out and have spent tons of time playing it since then. As with all the previous Arma series it has its problems (most of which I believe, should have been fixed before being sold to the public), but even with its faults it is still the closest thing to a real infantry simulator that a non-military person can purchase. With mods the game gets even better and more playable, and less 'sci-fi' like. Also, I've never played any of the single player stuff that comes with the game, I only do multiplayer with my group and I really enjoy it. Things to watch out for; you need a fast processor for this game - DO NOT buy it if your CPU isn't over 3.5 M. All of the Arma games are CPU intensive and this one is the worst for it. Don't expect it to be easy - this isn't Call of Duty or some other 'fps' that has the AI standing around waiting for you. They'll hide, shoot at distance and even chase you around. Use real-world tactics, if you're with friends, and see how well they work (they do), think 'stay alert' and you'll survive longer. There's loads of stuff I could say about this game, but really I play it for about 20 hours or so a week and really enjoy it.
203	0	a	Game seems fun and with lot of options and great mods, but the optimization is so horrible that i couldn't enjoy it and had to refund. Will buy it if they improve the performance but 3 years after release i doubt it.
4523	1	a	In my opinion, much better than any of the previous Arma games. First and foremost where do i start? The animations, the graphics and the physics are all improved perfectly and it just feels like you are at war! The optimization gives you much more freedom to tweak graphical settings. The Co-op just has to be the best feature, knowing that everyone depends on you and you depend on everyone as a team.
4855	1	a	10/10 great game, would do again -IGN
1248	1	a	amazing game and a great improvement from arma2, the controls are a bit confusing at first if youre used to arma2 but after getting used to them i noticed that arma3 has at least twice the fps of arma2 on my laptop and i have the graphics settings set to med/high instead of low/med as i did on arma2  still waiting for the modding community to become as active on this as it is on arma2
1282	1	a	Finally a game that is not casual targetandshoot, in ArmA you first have to plan your mission and then 95% of the time run around. But that feeling when running to an OP, taking position, knowing that you are gonna open fire soon...Just awesome.   As in the old ArmAs you get a lot of online mods, but also a very complicated control system and not much for your hardware. But i mean: It still looks very well on a Mid-End PC.  Also it is cool that Vehicels are powered rightly (some a bit OP, Bohemsia keeps patching, so...) and that you can discover the Whole huge map  So, I would say definitly buy, if you are clear that this is a simulation, not just a Battlefield or CoD
351	1	a	This game is so much fun. Dont buy if you have below a dual core though, you wont be able to run it well at all. I have a dual core and play it fine though, no lag or anything. This game is as close as it gets to real life and actually required skill, planning, and patience unlike any other FPS on the market. If you are looking for the best FPS/military simulator look no further. You've found it. Its Arma 3. 11/10 great game
2385	1	a	Been playing this game for about 8 months now and thought I'd publish my review of this game. When I first started to play the game I was new to Arma so didn't know the controls, it was quite tricky to figure out all the different controls but after a week or 2 I got to grips with most of it.   If you like real battles and the strategy of it then I would buy this game, you will enjoy it very much. The game is more in depth compared to other games like Battlefield for example, it's more realistic which is why I started playing it.   The graphics in game look amazing and the way they made the maps are very good also so if you have a good graphics card you will see the benefit on high settings.   The best thing about the game is there is many different mods you can play which I never realised before but i've had so much fun playing different ones.   Really you are buying this game but getting several of them for free as the mods are totally different to the others but still the same weapons and such but it feels different in how you play so buying it is very worth while it's mainly all I play it's that good.
5357	0	a	Well... what to say about this game in two words. Its Bad.   Arma 3 is terribly optimized for PC. Mine isn't the greatest, but I saw someone who had two 980s try running it, didn't even get over 50 FPS. Never knew you needed a $4,000 computer to even get over 60 FPS. The servers are terrible, there are rarely any servers that are populated with a &lt;150 ping. Even if I try to connect to any of them, it says connection failed. People may have thought I made a bad review because of how difficult and realistic it was. I like games like this. Too bad bohemia interactive didn't put enough effort into making this game run really well, and to make the server connection good. Instead of fixing these problems and making announcements about them, they decide to release DLC after DLC to add onto this broken game. If you are stupid enough to pay $15 for two helicopters, you must not be too wise with your money. I should have mentioned, when getting into a server, you must either donate or go into ts to fly. Why can't they just use game chat? Guess I will never get my pilot license. They probably sould have fixed arma 2 as well, before making this one. I refuse to run this on the LOWEST POSSIBLE settings, because there is no reason I should. A game like this, you need good view distance, and things need to looks some what nice. You can't see an enemy a few thousand meters out, but they sure can see you. Please DO NOT buy this game unless it goes on sale. This game is nowhere near worth $60. I would say its worth 20-30 range.
437	1	a	Arma 3 like all the rest of the series, will only offer what you put into it - after all its not really a game is it. Try the editor and learn what you are capable of doing in arma, then apply that knowledge according to what you want to see - for me - personally, i'd preffer life like realism.. and my reward - is what i've learned not to do in a real situation - how will you play arma? - Dont let my arma online XP fool you, i have been scripting in arma since moby â¥â¥â¥â¥ was a minnow - i still dont know what its capable of - remember.. a simple quotation mark, being misplaced can make you frusterated and trying for minutes or even hours to end the script you knew only a few months ago - 8)) - i've been there - Example:   !alive nearestObject [obj1, 'House']; &lt;--- this took me 25 min to figure out that i was not putting an exclamation mark in beginning - it tells weather or not the obj is alive or not - in this case it was not and i needed to represent that - you see - simple, but it can cause discreppancy with the whole scipt not understanding what you want - so read over it always -  and yes.. i felt stupid when i finally got it right, but that is how it works. welcome to arma logic ;) i recommend arma 3 and all the rest, to anyone bored with cod or battlefield or counterstrike or what ever you need a break from - peace out -     - RenderSilent -

3702	1	a	Good game with friends, very moddable, if you like a game with variying pace this is for you.
3065	1	a	This game is so good it makes my â¥â¥â¥ sizzle
1288	0	a	This is going to be a pretty long review of ArmA 3 so lets get started. ArmA 3 is an open world Military simulator, designed to capture real war. And it does this fairly well. But I cannnot recommend the game for the following reasons.   Firstly we will start with the Pros and then the Cons.      Pros:         ArmA3 is set on either Stratis, Altis or Tanoa depending if you purchased the DLC or not. Stratis is a good small map with good positions for setting up interesting military operations same with Altis. Tanoa is a Fujian like terrain with many trees and bushes allowing for jungle type warfare scenarios which is both interesting and engauging.       The game is highly moddable you can write scripts to add new functionality or create models that create new types of gameplay. Such as new weapons or vehicles. The engine is powerful in terms of versitility but not so great in other aspects.       Vehicle,uniforms and weapon content is quite wide in terms of what you get for the base game but all the other DLCs add a fair bit more than what the base game offers including a new jungle type map.       The game is visually appealling with post processing effects including 16bit HDR and Your basic bloom effects. It also has high resolution textures for all vehicles players and objects.      There exists a pretty wide range of game mode variation from Invade &amp; Annex to KoTH all the way to GTA remake called Altis Life.      The games weather is a real testiment to what TrueSky can do it's beautiful the sky along with the cloud and weather effects. combined withe HDR the game comes quite close to actual real life sky colouring. Coupled with the weather effects sound improvements that game with Tanoa eliminated the tin sounding thunder claps.        Cons:         Game suffers extreme bottlenecks in the rendering loop with super-sampling. A resolution of 200% set in ArmA 3 results in a massive drop in videocard usage. to nearly 28% This is probably due to ArmA 3 not feeding enough work to the videocard as a result the videocard is always waiting for an update.      Game depends on single core clock performance because of how the threading model works. Simply put the game main thread sit on a single core with worker threads sent to other cores, those worker threads report back to the main thread so in the instance that a worker thread is in the geometry rendering or texture rendering the main-loop is in a wait-state for the sub-threads to report back their status as a result CPU and GPU usage drop like a brick.       Artificial Intelligence is definitely not intelligence the AI are smart enough to aimbot you thats about it and you have to use external scripts to fix something that should already be in place. I mean tab into zues and they have a missile reticle on your player behind a build / tree. They drive and are as smart as your little toys you used to have as a kid that would crash into a wall turn randomly in 1 direction then move forward and repeat. Half the time never actually getting around the obstacle      The community is rude and generally arrogant, you ask certain questions and they will attack your coding because you did 1 thing wrong instead of actually pointing out the problem they bash what you did. They are certainly not real programmers in any respect.       The scripting engine is yes versitile and functional but thats about it. Many nuances exist in the scripting engine and documentation for it is dismal and lacking. Edited by the community through much trial and error. And assumed functionality from previous experience. Python or Lua which Lua is more commmonly found in other games as a script API are known to have very good documentation as they are so wide spread SQF on the other hand is a mess a god damn mess.       Networking wise the game doesn't scale beyond 40 - 50 players depending on the server, but in general for example KoTH with all it's server-side mod components and client side it still suffers massive FPS drops when clients get close together ArmA 3 is a military simulator engine is people repeatedly try to treat it like GTA or an MMO type game engine which it is not, and so performance overall suffers considerably when we get &gt; 50 players online.       Mods don't follow a standard of work, as such anyone can publish ArmA 3 mods, even if they may contain catastrophic bugs that lead to memory leakage in the sense of external dlls or scripts.       Scripts also don't follow a standard of work, standardisation is almost non-existent in game and people often slap scripts together and hope for the best. Without considering the consequences of that script.      Code theft and thievery is rampant 1 community develops something the other has to steal it from that community. People also try to threaten about code supposably owned by previous communities which it is only owned by them if money was to change hands and or contracts were signed which if they were not would not matter by default you own the code rights.       Apex DLC is only worth the money if you only care about the map the map is the most interesting part of Tanoa thats about it.       Many missions are highly toxic and encourage disgusting gameplay behaviour and the related. wasteland,Altis Life and KoTH are just mere reincarnations of Grand Theft Auto, Call of Duty and DayZ modification. May as well be.       Gameplay becomes boring an uninteresting after being both drained by the communities and the script engine not cooperating for whatever undocumented stupid reason.       The wiki documentation is a mess a total mess certain pages re-route to completely unrelated pages repeatedly, with a nesting effect there is no class inheritence or order, the wiki is mostly chaotic and messy.       Communiities have a real sense of entitlement just because you wrote it you should share it, this is not the case. With the above stated 'theivery' of code. People feel they deserve it in the community because of knowledge they contributed to the wiki etc. They are entititled to sweet f.a .     Thats just my little breakdown and rant about how bad the game is and it's problems. If bohemia were to fix the framerate problems many people experience from people with I7-6700K at 4.0Ghz to I7-5820K at 3.3 Ghz then I might consider it recommedable, but this game is still suffering framerate problems 2 years since it's release. The community hasn't cleaned up it's act and the game still does poor usage of videocard resources it should be using a lot more. The engine is old and archiac and requires both 64bit addressing in order to help the large maps without having to stream the data by dynamically loading and unloading data on the fly to get around the 32bit memory problem. 64bit memory would also allow more resources to be utilised because more threads often require more RAM. For each of their instances.        This is my first and last Bohemia game I will buy    
5053	1	a	Amazing game Love it so much :3
3539	1	a	BEST SIMULLATOR OF WAR IN THE WORLD!!!
1370	1	a	THis game is not like any FPS it delivers skill,Awsomeness, and the best army simulator game out there. I HIGHLY recommend this game. In my view if you dont get Arma your missing half of the greatness in pc
3839	1	a	Sure, there are better plane simulators, car simulators, and other kinds of simulators, but Arma 3 is the only game that can bring all of these simulators together, and make it a full, complete, military simulator. with tons of vehicles, from civilian cars and helicopters to military tanks and jets, where even the mirrors work while you're inside of them. There are also lots of gamemodes to choose from and mods to download and play.
188	1	a	I bought the game a day before it went on sale :|
3006	1	a	After nearly 3700 hours into this game its the mods that I love the most.
3927	1	a	11/10 BEST GAME EVER MADE (as of 05/11/2015)
2417	1	a	I cant fly nor do I like to annoy people..  Only kidding, I lurb arma!
4991	0	a	now i really want to thumbs up this game but i just cant unless u have an amazing pc most game modes especially king of the hill will run at 10-20 fps i dont have a bad computer it rund far cry 4 on ultra at 40-50 fps but this game will only frustrate u if u dont have a really expensive pc ....... i loved it personaly with its team based tatics and damage model yet whn ur in the war zone it lags so much so thts y i dont thumbs up this game
3198	1	a	It is pretty good. With even only low settings on, it is beautiful. Have only really played Exile and Life mods though. Great game, give it a 1000/1000
4476	1	a	Its so real its almost like am actually playing a video game.
389	0	a	nice game, nice graphics ....acceptable gameplay with ai, good gameplay in pvp, could be lots of fun but there is only one reason i cannot recommend this game to someone ...if it happens you to be banned from BattlEye, you will get 0 (zero) support plus you will be banned from all games that uses BattlEye; Arma2, Day-Z etc ...i bought the game in the first day it came out, supporter editon 70euros ...just that i did not find the same support i was hopping to get if i have a problem ...i still love the game but no, no one has ever replied to me a damn thing to all my mails sent appart from the automated one ...so NO ...DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! at least till BattlEye goes out of the picture ...Good Luck!
1421	1	a	Best games ive played in awhile.
633	1	a	Sexy game 
4617	1	a	geart game enjyed a lot,but not much of a multiplayer game..
5133	0	a	If you came here because saw some youtube of great playz and got hyped on this game go and watch some longplay footage without editing or watch live-stream. Then you may change your mind. Because regular gameplay is way different from carefully edited best-ofs. This game has these nice moments separated by long periods of struggling with interface and trying not to die from glitches.  Is is not kind of game you can grab on sale and have fun with. You can't start playing this game without having someone to introduce you to it because singleplayer is really limited and multiplayer is quite inaccessible to uninitiated newbie. So if you wonder if you could just take it and play for some hours having fun then forget about it - you wont. And if some of your friends told you to play with them then sure, by all means take it - even fighting with sticks with friends is fun so Arma3 can be too ;).  You can read negative reviews about game optimization. These are reviews from somebody who probably never played actual Arma3 - game runs great, looks great, works smooth with hi-rez and hi-fps. But then who buys Arma to play Arma? Not many. Obviously. People install Arma to play mods. But mods, that are lifeblood of gaming and salvation of the industry [sarcasm!], are usually made by wannabe-pros-script-kids who plant hack over hack in mod in attempt to implement anything. Constant loops designed to eat cpu cycles, photo-quality textures for sexy female models, shiny new guns with more polygons than whole aircraft. Then couple of these are bunched together on one server, with possible conflicts and no concern about limitations of average user's hardware. People cry that their powerful pcs can't handle it but it is terrible quality mods that kill it and slow your game to crawl. Game is optimized but mods are not curated so every piece of random hacks are allowed and people who run mods expect the game engine to somehow detect bad code and optimize it. Want high fps? Dont install poor mods. Refuse to play unoptimized mods and encourage others to stop playing them - maybe this way you will tell mod-devs to start thinking about their work [hint: they will just stop making mods].  The problem is that beside vehicle and bullet mechanics things go wrong in this production. Physics is bad - you will make backflips with your APC or die from touching dynamic object. Infantry controls are terrible - probably infantry unit is not required in simulator for army so what you receive here is human character that is controled like a tank. Nobody cared to plan and hone useful user interface to provide smooth control system for player character. You get avatar to control and whole keyboard of buttons to make him move. You can customize it to your will, you can use all external devices you like - but it is up to you to make it work. And even when you make it work as you want you will still have game with unfinished mechanic for infantry:  - your gear doesn't limit your movement so you can carry kgs of equimpent and you will crawl, crouch and stand up at the same speed.  - you cannot even cancel action - you started doing something you are sitting duck.  - missing animations and movement options you would expect from combat-sim. If you can think about doing something you can't do it. Numerous games accustomed us to make quick combat movements, sliding under/over obstacles, hiding behind cover or jumping over walls, entering through the windows and so on so it is painful to be unable to do it here. You cannot even pull out weapon while walking or switch to binoculars while lying down.  - carrying heavier weapon in your hands feels like holding a handgun - you can run around with it feeling no inertia or being slowed down. Some arcade games feel more realistic than Arma.  Game wasn't built around infantry, it is not FPS by heart, this is vehicular combat sim with driver/pilot and gun operator. Infantry units are implemented as VR training for rookies - learning the bullet behavior for long distance shooting, practicing mildot ranging, operating launchers, working with map and team communication.  You won't have smooth close-mid range combat with guns.  This part of the engine was hacked into the existing system and barely works.  Unfortunately.
2663	1	a	This is simply the best simulation game ever and is very realistic. There are several amazing aspects of Arma 3 including the graphics they are amazing at max settings it is just so impressive. The gameplay nails the realism but dosen't get too frustrating and the sheer level of interactivity is staggering. The scale is another defining aspect of Arma the huge map really is impressive and anything can happen from small pistol firefights to tank battles. Modding is siply amazing with this game it's easy to mod and installing them are quite easy too. Really good stuff but it is very intensive on ur system
1120	1	a	Very fun game to play with some friends :D
1651	1	a	I think its an amazing Game and if you dont have it, get it. only one problem for me though, this game seems, well, as expensive as it was when it was released, its been out for 2 years, ithink it could atleast be dropped by couple dollars anyway thats just wut i think but srsly.... get dis game....
4344	1	a	Arma 3 is a very immensely amusing game. I mainly play Altis life and i have got to say it has the best graphics ive ever seen in a game, it almost look like a on-going movie. Arma 3 is a military Training Simulation (Milsim). Anyone who liked Arma 2 will like this and anyone who haven't played Arma 2 will like this, and yes, that wasn't a typing error. I would most definitely recommend this game to someone who don't currently have the game because it is really realistic where there would be realistic actions that need to be taken. I have also persuaded a couple of my mates to get it.  But... There is once downfall of this game, You need a high-end computer to handle it, which is ok for me but might not be ok for someone who wants the game but has a Mid or Low end computer. And yes if you want to run this game off a Laptop, then you will need a very expensive on that can handle it.  All in all, i would recommend this to anyone that own or have a high-end computer.
1451	1	a	I would highly recommend this game to any mil-sim lovers out there.
1796	1	a	Install Survival mod Jump on server Become one of three biggest clans in server Clan comments on youtube to raid them while online We raid them while online 25 satchel charges later Discover clan has glitch built main part of base into building so satchel charges do nothing Clan continue to glitch build and camp fresh spawn location Stop playing for a while Jump on server See clan swim across river Shoot clan member swiming across river in the face Find out its that clan Other clan members run me over in a strider and call it 'karma' 20/10
3196	1	a	This is my review on ARMA 3:  Pros: +Huge modding community +Loads of guns +Many different scopes +Quite a lot more but currently can't remember.  Cons: -Community can be cancerous at times -Game is CPU dependent meaning that if you have a crap CPU but good GPU you're in for a fun time  Hopefully performance shouldnt be an issue when Apex comes out as it will include the DX12 upgrade which is free.
2282	1	a	So the campaign is complete. A lot of folks are still having the BF4 or A3 discussion (argument). Here's what I found. A3 is not without its faults. One of the biggest apects of the game is that it's aimed at the 'thinker'. What I mean by that is that you have endless ways to achieve your goals, but yes in being a milsim you can be taken out by a lucky shot from a guy you never saw (with pinpoint AI targeting) from 500yrds away.   For some folks that's the heart of endless frustration and this is not the game for you. BF4 shouldn't be bashed either, it's simply for a group of folks that want action and eye candy - and it delivers on both of those in spades. A3 has amazing visuals in my opinion, yet they are harder to appreciate because so much tweaking is required to get decent FPS while keeping some of the visual goodies.   It's the fact that A3 is ridiculously hard sometimes, and requires a huge time investment compared to most games, that make it so satisfying when everything finally goes right. A3 gives you a sense of accomplishment like no other when everything hits the fan and you (or your teammates) quick thinking pays off for a win. Being able to jump into almost any vehicle or aircraft leave you feeling that you can be the ultimate ____________ (tank driver, helo pilot, fixed wing ace etc...).   Yes BF4 has some of these components, but delivered in a completely different way. Run, gun, get shot a bunch of times, hide, heal, and do it over again. And that's completely ok if that's you're style of gameplay and what you enjoy. A3 plan, plan, plan some more, cross a huge amount of terrain that can literally take hours on foot, and get shot by a dude you never saw, or...) make the hard win. You will dump huge amounts of time into A3 to be decent at it (plenty of folks don't have that kind of time to commit). BF4 get on..play for a match or two and leave if you want.   BF4 has some great DLC's the latest carrier edition looks awesome. A3 has mod...after mod...after mod. With a workshop full of missions (horrible to great), plus a community that's pretty engaging and helpful.   For me it's A3 all the way!
442	1	a	Love the game!. Havent had as much fun playing a game as I have this one in a long time. The multiplayer mod servers are where you will have the most fun at!.
78	1	a	Just look at home many hours I have spent in this game... NUFF SAID!
4898	0	a	This game is hands down the best shooter ever made. It is a very immersive game that has features that make it feel like real life. You get injured and if you heal you will walk slower, carry too much and you won't be able to move, realistic stamina, etc. The amount of weapons and vehicles is nice but nowhere near the competitors. Yet those few weapons have the most realistic damage and ballistics of any game I've played.  Now after seeing that you are probably asking why I didn't suggest this game to others. Well the game has a lot of cool features and is very promising in all the different ways you can play. But the game is unplayable at times and is very unreliable. In single player a $2000 dollar computer will run at 40-50 fps on all maxed out video settings. (That being one of the major faults of the game itself; a game shouldn't require two to three thousand dollars for a computer to run single player at subpar frame rates.) That same single player also has one of the worst AI systems in a game. If you're in the line of fire prone with your group of guys they will shoot you to get to the enemy. This happens more often than you would think, and itâs such a problem your squad mates will often kill each other. The enemy AI is far superior in combat and you will find yourself leaving your AI squad behind so you can actually accomplish missions because they tend to get the attention of the enemy AI which seems to target you first no matter what. The enemy AI can see you through bushes 800m away crawling through the 3ft tall grass. So if you want a stealth shooter go somewhere else. In fact if you want a better AI and squad experience go buy the original Ghost Recon because it had a better AI and squad system than this game.   WHO CARES ABOUT SINGLE PLAYER JOHN!   Ok then, so you give up on the single player and you go to multiplayer expecting a similar experience without having to worry about the AI. You'll start up a moderate sized 40 man server that has a ping of 30 when you join that is about full and your system will bog down to 10-15 fps. You go around a corner checking for enemies in a town and you won't be able to move your gun fast enough and you'll get owned over and over. If you try to be in a vehicle with a person who has a junk computer, good luck seeing anything.  All in all, great features on a horrible performance platform, and to make up for it you need a server for a computer. 
1545	1	a	Awesome only if you play it with friends
1212	1	a	Probably the best game ive ever played.....117 hours in the past 2 weeks.....nuff said.......
275	1	a	Have barely played much of the game at all really, yet I feel it could be very promising.  Definitely recomend so far, will report back once I have played a sufficient ammount of gameplay to adequately say I have experienced all of the avalible gameplay (I estimate I am only 1/10th of the way there thusfar).
2312	1	a	This is an amazing game! Quit looking at these reviews and buy it already!
3181	1	a	  It's a pretty fun game. I didn't really get much time to play, but every second I played, I enjoyed. It was surely fun. The multiplayer is fun with the roleplaying servers and CO-OP. If you are really into military games not too far back in time and not futuristic, then this is the game for you. Graphics are great. These are not the best of the best but I'm actually surprised about how good it is still. Audio is great too. Some multiplayer players are really some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ that constantly taze you for no reason on roleplaying servers. But I still had a blast playing it! Good job Bohemia Interactive  
3629	1	a	Great Game
4646	1	a	buy it its awesome !!! 
2818	1	a	Very fun and emmersive, especially when you a group of friends get together and work as a team. One of my favorite games of all time.
3358	1	a	You think you gonna shoot â¥â¥â¥â¥ in this game? You dont. You walk, you run. This is running simulator.
3857	1	a	a 12 yr old raged at me for taking his pilot seat in an attack helicopter, i then proceeded to takeoff and lag into the ground, teamkilling 6 guys, got banned from server.  420/69 would lag/steal again   p.s. i have an i7 4820k, gtx 780, 16gb ram, 240gb ssd.....pull 17 fps most of time GOTY

2617	1	a	Great game. Love it !!!
5066	1	a	Cant stop playing!
589	0	a	Terrible game, developers highly ignored optimizing and fixing bugs in the game. Almost unplayable on multiplayer because of the lack of hit detection, sky rocketing desync, and minimal power usage resulting in less than 20 fps at times. Keep in mind I have a $1200 rig. Now for the good: The concept and basic features of the game are wonderful. If the developers worked out the kinks involved with the networking/performance aspect of the game it would be a five star game. That is the only reason I do not recommend it. Fix the bugs and it's a wonderful game. As of right now it is unplayable.
4105	1	a	I bought this game last year and wasn't expecting to get enough game time to get my monies worth. I have definitely done that and more. This game has so much potential and the amount of mods and different types of servers to play multiplayer on is numerous. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone that I know that doesn't already have the game. Yes it's expensive but you will get your money back just in the amount of enjoyment and time you spend in this game.
1983	1	a	If you love having to press 36 different key combinations in order to crouch behind a rock, this game is for you.
1181	1	a	ArmA III is quite different from most other first person shooters. As to be expected since it is a military simulator. With it's clunky UI, desync problems, unexplained gameplay, complicated controls, and many other bugs, it is clearly not perfect. However, when you get past the UI, and have played the game long enough to understand how it works, ArmA III offers some of the best experiences in video gaming. There's nothing quite like a 100 vs 100 match that turns the colossal Altis map or the still giant Stratis map into a war torn battlefield. The true heart to this game is the mods, and boy are there a lot of them! To start, I would suggest checking out Altis Life, Battle Royale, and Wasteland. These mods add so much life to the game. Many of these mods feel like complete individual games themselves.  In short, though there may be some bugs and a steep learning curve, there is no doubt that ArmA III offers arguably the best multiplayer experience in video gaming.  - 9/10 would glitch again
1863	1	a	Played it alittle, its alright.
3586	1	a	One of the best games out there ! With the amount of missions / mods out there.. the game will never end.

2623	1	a	Arma 3 has got to be the greatest open worls fps/Third person shooter on steam. It's combat is realistic and satisfying, especially in vehicle like jets because of its challenging but rewarding flight model. This game also has a brilliant modding communtiy and it keeps the game fresh and excititng. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who has interest in fps/ third person open worls games.
1486	1	a	  Is Arma 3 worth it?
5117	0	a	I really want to love Arma, but I just cant bring myself to. It's the most realistic game ever, and it has probably a lifetimes worth of content. Beautiful graphics and the complexity of the gameplay isn't actually all that daunting once you get used to it. But thats not the problem. The problem is the dog-dirt AI. Its seriously the worst AI I have ever seen in a video game, EVER. I actually cannot describe how awful it is.   Should you attempt to use AI to help you drive a vehicle, God have mercy on your soul. Try and be the gunner? The driver is going to do his best to run into walls and flip the tank in a ditch. See an enemy? Well then he is going to turn the tank around, expose the weak rear armor, and stop in an open field. Tell him to move? Nope, suddenly they forgot how to obey commands and do a weird back and forth jerking roll thing. Try and be the driver? The gunner in a tank with thermal optics will somehow miss a tank sitting 3 feet in front of him. Your infantry teammates will engage the enemy by breaking cover, running into the middle of the street, and spraying on full auto. Vehicles constantly get stuck on rocks, lampposts, trees, ditches, ect. Sometimes they won't spot an enemy in the open while they are being used as target practice, and other times they pull of aimbot level first-shot headshots from 500m while standing upright. Helicopters and planes are more effective as kamikaze weapons, and single enemies with rifles can easily take out a wing of attack helos.   I really really want to love this game, but its virtually impossible to enjoy with AI teammates. I have every AI enhancement mod I can find, nothing helps. Every time I come back to it I get so mad. Whether its my M1 driver stopping in an open field and then un-learning how to drive so we can be RPG fodder or my gunner in an apache refusing to engage enemy infantry in the open leading to an early demise, the AI in this game is insanely poor. It makes the AI out of battlefield 2 look like rocket science. AI able to take the initiative and get in a technicals .50 without being specifically ordered to approach the vehicle, and then you having to get in and switch spots for 10 minutes to finagle them out of a passenger seat into the obviously useful position is a pipe dream in this game. Its super enjoyable to walk around and play in Zeus mode, but unless you have great internet you are going to get very, very, very upset.
1927	1	a	Killed terrorists.  10/10 would buy again.
2459	1	a	NUMBER 1 FAVORITE GAME!!!
1773	1	a	Arma III is a combat simulator. It creates an envioroment where you can perform and learn the basics of the movement of a military soldier. The campaign is really good, there is nothing wrong with it at all except from where I find it hard at some cases. But overall it holds a realistic simulation of how its like.  I also love multiplayer on Arma III. People can transform CO-OP gamemodes to a realistic enviroment in multiplayer, like some people can form squads and they like to make it look like a real squad which contains planning, tatical, commands, things like that. It makes the game look real. Arma III was released 7 months ago but grows a better game each time. There are certain amount of bugs and glitches in it but its very rare the bugs or glitches occur....  The game is quite expensive I know, its 35.99 but its good to spend money on a brilliant game like this. If you want to spend more on it you can buy Digital Deluxe Upgrade for 8.99. I recommend buying the Deluxe Edition for 39.99, make sure you like what you are buying of the Deluxe Edition. When you buy this game I hope you have alot of fun. Thanks!   
4233	1	a	I disobeyed my 12 Year Old Commanders orders and mortared our supply station.
3407	1	a	Bought this for Battle Royale 100/10 people killed  (its the modern hunger games)= Forbes (Prepare for the same â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ engine except this time it doesnt look blurry af)= IGN (This is better than Dayz Yet Dayz has had more development time and money put in)= Bob Barker overall this should be rated 3 out of 4 armas Maybe arma 4 will be more unoptimized. But i still love it 'our games are â¥â¥â¥â¥ but you'll still buy them' -with love Dean Hall Buy this game its the most fun you'll have in awhile
4682	1	a	This game is Amazing! Battle Royale King of the Hill Breaking Point, Theses are just three of the awesome gamemodes/mods
5007	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ 
3543	1	a	this game would be fun if I had any friends  #feelsbad
4246	1	a	If you want to real reality you must play this game! It's wonderfull...
2552	1	a	The default stuff isn't the best, but with mods this game is awesome.
4871	1	a	Like this game. It's one of the best game's i've ever played!! +rep
4221	1	a	I am doing this to level up my steam profile.
2136	1	a	This is great game, and I really recommend this game for military lovers. But if you have enough money, it would be better to buy Apex too!!! But still, this is my best game.
4842	1	a	I have played the predecessors for a long, long time and always thought of them (although crooked) the games to end all games for me. Then ARMA 3 came along, and now I know that ARMA 2 and especially ARMA were good games, but far from being the nearly perfect games I made them out to be.  IÂ´m not on about realism, because it is a game after all. No game can ever come close to the real thing, and it would be a horrible game if it would. Think of realism as things like 'take a bullet to the head in game and never be able to play ever again'. What I AM on about is the level of immersion. That ARMA 3 can put you under real stress, can make you involuntarily shout out 'INCOMING!' or make you race for virtual cover, make you flinch and instill fear for your virtual life.  This time around, the experience is hindered by far fewer bugs and glitches than in any ARMA game ever. The inventory system has been reworked, vehicle and aircraft physics have been improved, the engine has been rebuilt from scratch. All while retaining a 'feel' very much like ARMA 2. In essence, this game is the best ARMA ever released - improved on all fronts, no features lost in translation.  On top of the technical aspect, even though this game hasnÂ´t been live for a long time now, it has already been modded, customised and improved by the vast, loyal and savvy community, to a degree that ARMA 2 saw about 2-3 years after its release - and there is far, far more to come.  Can I recommend this game? Yes. Is it a game for everybody? No. But it is a game *everybody* should try. This has been the only game I have bought for full price (44.99 â¬) in years, and I donÂ´t regret a single cent spent. What are you still waiting for? get ARMA 3. It will be different from anything youÂ´ve ever played. Except ARMA 2.
3917	1	a	The game is great! It is a very realistic war simulator that I highly recommend. It makes Call of Duty look like dog poop. There are a lot of mods that are fun to play. You can do just about anything in this game, fly helos, drive quads, trucks, tanks, shoot people, and much more. It just makes me mad that I bought it for $59.99 three days ago and today it is on sale for $29.99.  11/10 Would pay full price again.
4270	1	a	A crazy amount of single and multiplayer content just like arma 2 but way more responsive with some new welcome additions to the already immersive experience. If you like massive battlefields and as close to real life combat this is state of the art!
4379	1	a	This game is a must get for milltary shooter lovers. There is an editor and can even get mods for it like Garys mod. This is great and I think that anyone can use this game. Also great story.
1446	1	a	this game is the top military simulation (it is the only one). only problem for this game is : you must have high end pc for standard to high graphic for ultra graphic seting require lot more than high end pc. the game work on ultra until you dont start masive fights with tanks and helicopter and hell on screen. Then the engine show his weak points. it is not optimized for this, In game like cod and battlefield you will play at max setting at 120 fps, but here goes from 90 to 19. but this game is not only on franatic action and who will have more head shoots and kills. Here is all about teamwork, how to stay alive in war, in cordinating actions, comunicating with team, making right choices at right time. Here one good mission take 2h at least to complete if first you dont get bullet and you even didnt see enemy. this game is war and all about the war and military life. it is not for cod generations... they will be very frustrating in game like this. here you use brain, pace and time and military skill will be useful.   This game need update on engine and how he work on massive battle. LOD optimization and few fixes. But guys work all the time on this matter. Arma receve all the time smol and big patches. Updates on sound, weapon handling, graphic problems, and community does great work for this game, tons of new item vehicles, maps, mission campains and all work in mp.   What definitly need a big update and fix is terrain builder and other tools for making maps and mission.   for game i give 8/10 need more optimization only that is problem here..   content official and community 10/10  for editor 5/10 need a lot more work and better setup, guide and documentation... too long learning curve, hard to make decent maps without help from youtube and lots of forums reading and searching.....
134	1	a	It's okay I guess,played for a few hours.
3207	1	a	Really refined compared to Arma 2, they did a lot of work, and the campaign is well written and a pleasure to play. UI is cleaned up, mechanics are mastered and smoothed, and gameplay is a lot more immersive. Great moves Bohemia, keep it up.
1343	1	a	GREAT GAME VERY CHALLENGING AND REALLISTIC COMBAT NOT FORTHOSE WHO PLAY COD OR BATTLEFIELD.ITS A VERY HARDCORE GAME AND MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE A REAL SOLDIER AND PUTS YOU RIGHT IN THE HEART OF WAR.I LOVE THIS GAME ALOT MORE THAN ANY OTHER SHOOTER OUT THERE I JUST HOPE THERE WILL BE AN ARMA 4 SOMETIME.
5165	0	a	This game has more bugs than a bug nest.
5184	0	a	Not good, don't waste $40 on this game, I can't get my money back because I afk'd for 2 hours because I didnt close the game. I regret this purchase.
1342	1	a	Only shooting game in my library that doesn't make me rage when I die. Because in this game, death can be fun as well.  Weird thing to say I know, but when a new pilot takes 20 minutes to get you in the AO then lands the chopper you feel so excited for him only a moment later an enemy aircraft bombs the chopper and your entire squad. I personally can't do nothing but laugh when this happens. :D  10/10  Restored my faith in Bohemia Interactive.
1776	1	a	1.buy game 2.refund 3.buy Overpass souvenir package 4.Unbox AWP pink ddpat souvenir 5.buy game again 6.Profit
2518	1	a	Decent game, might do it again
5118	0	a	This is not a good game.   The engine is a mess. I don't think any computer on earth can run this game at 60FPS with a lot of scripts in the background or if there is a lot going on. Everybody knows this, yet it seems to be shrugged off by the community or even laughed at. The game plays awfully as well, it's very clunky and unresponsive. You have to play to understand, of course. It all has to do with a broken and unoptimized engine. I question how they got away with it.  The multiplayer is awful as nobody plays it for the Arma experience. This game blew up, and 'life'servers dominate the multiplayer. You'll either be playing king of the hill, 'life'roleplays, or zombie servers. You also can't forget the awful performance you'll get in multiplayer, as there are usually scripts in the background. Enjoy playing at low FPS.   If you want a military simulator, look elsewhere.
64	1	a	 For all the haters out there; Arma 3 does not have glitches or bugs, they are called features and we  love  them.
1990	1	a	*Buys game on sale* *Downloads exile* *Gets amazing gear* *dies by AI* *Gets stuff back* *dies again by the same AI* 11/10 buy this game
5410	0	a	Worst experiance I ever had. I constantly get kicked from servers for having a high ping, but in reallity my ping is always 80 or below. The game seems fun but, i'll never get to find out.
3892	1	a	Hello am 48 year man from somalia. Sorry for my bed englando. I selled my wife for internet connection for play '3 Arma' and very good chouse . 10 buy game
131	0	a	I'm bound to get a metric tonne of dislikes for this, but I'll live with it. Please note that I'm only giving it a negative review because of my history with the Arma franchise (starting with Armed assault, moving through arma 2 and all its expansions and playing using ACE mod on each) and the fact that I had certain expectations when I inevitably pre-ordered this game.  Now please note, I have no issue with the setting, near future is fine provided it is done correctly, and in that regard I believe Arma 3 really shines. I have yet to play a game set in the near future that is as 'believable' as Arma 3, because the majority of the weapons and vehicles already exist... and a lot of them are outdated.  My issue with arma 3 is the fact that there is a shocking lack of content with the base game, there is a massive step downwards in terms of realistic fidelity, and the performance of the game is abysmal, even with someone with a computer that is massively overpowered for the game. Now, the argument could be made that no where else could I turn for a game that seamlessly integrates combined land, sea and air warfare on a massive scale, and I would believe that argument if Arma II and it's expansions didn't exist. That's the problem, this has all been done before, and to a much better standard. Why do soldiers only flinch when shot, and continue to fight back as if nothing happened? In Arma 2, if I shot the leg/arm of an AI, his movement would be impaired or his aim would be impaired, in Arma 3, nothing is simulated whatsoever. Instead, enemies take multiple hits to be downed, even with extended armour turned off!  I don't understand why Bohemia decided to create 3 factions that are more or less mirror images of one another (the reused assets between mounted MG's, grenade launchers, missile launchers alike is puzzling and frankly, lazy.), I don't understand why they removed core features such as dragging/carrying wounded allies to be healed properly by a dedicated medic, as opposed to the magical 'heal all' FAKs we have in game, and I don't understand why they're still using the same tired engine as they used 20 years ago for a game that is on a much greater scale in both terrain, amount of buildings and graphical fidelity.  Don't get me wrong, Arma III is a stroke of technical genius, managing to take the virtual reality engine and make it look THIS good is mind blowing, but what's the point in looking good, if the game runs like â¥â¥â¥â¥? Even when installed on an SSD, there is still the stutter loading when playing online, and I've found that in cities etc. the framerates are completely unplayable when playing with a reasonable player count of 30+.  So here are what I consider to be the pros, and the cons:  Pros: - Beautiful looking game - Interesting concepts behind a near future setting - Movement is easily better than the previous games - Stance system (whilst part of movement, is good enough to be mentioned on it's own) - Bipods (when they work) are really damn cool - AI is much smarter than previous installments, reacting better to cover and suppression - Sound design is much better, although guns still sound a bit 'off', something I rectify quite quickly with sound mods - Inventory system is really nice and intuitive - Steam workshop support makes mods easier to use, however due to the file size limit only really supports basic mods which I couldn't care less for. - Campaign is a bit more cohesive this time around, previous campaigns felt a bit aimless - Pre recorded voice lines  Cons (there are a lot of them): - The game caters to more casual players (will explain with the following points) 1. Ammo pool showing how many shots are left in your gun, regardless of difficulty setting is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing stupid 2. AI can tank several rounds, and fire back with perfect accuracy with nothing more than a flinch, gone are the days of crippling someone's arm to reduce their accuracy or taking out their legs to stop them from moving 3. Vehicle crosshairs almost never line up with their HUD counterparts, and cannot be turned off 4. Weapons have poor penetration value, I've seen the argument being made that in the future armoured vests will allow you to survive longer, which I can appreciate, but that does not stop the fact that the kinetic force of a bullet would still wound you to the point where you are ineffective. I don't mind the soldiers surviving, but at least incapacitate them for â¥â¥â¥â¥s sake. 5. Magical FAKs that heal you to the point where a dedicated medic is a luxury, not a requirement. 6. (More of a server issue than the game itself) Everyone is running casual epoch, altis life etc servers. These far outnumber the traditional game servers, which I think speaks for itself really. It's a game targetting people who aren't here for an authentic military shooter. It's here for people that want to use third person, sprint everywhere and not take things seriously. - Each faction is practically identical, there is no assymetrical balance like the previous games, everyone has one assault rifle, one type of grenade, one type of MBT, one type of transport helicopter, one type of attack helicopter, ONE JET EACH (wtf?), and the exact same grenade launchers, missile launchers, UAV's, UGV's and submarines. The recycled content is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing lazy. - The DLC's thus far have offered very little content for their price. For example BAF in arma 2 added an entire new faction to play, with vehicles and weapons respectively. Whilst I can't comment on the expansion pack, Operation arrowhead was practically a new game, and from the PR that bohemia have released, TANOA seems about the most compelling part of Apex, which will probably run like â¥â¥â¥â¥ because the amount of trees etc. - I don't like Altis. Personal preference. - Game runs like absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥ on several rigs I've tried, including a 5960x, 24gb of ram, 2x Titan X's in SLI all running from an ssd to remove any loading stutter. It's just not possible to get this game running nicely. - Hardly any weapons/vehicles per faction. I touched on this briefly, but it was months until CSAT and NATO got jets, and they're both ground attackers only? Why? Why is there only one large transport vehicle shared between each faction? Why does each faction have the exact same UAV's, the same UGV's, submarines, grenades, chemlights, smoke grenades, ghillie suits, armour etc etc etc. WHAT THE â¥â¥â¥â¥. - Why does it take multiple bullets to drop a guy at 1m? Unless I'm using 7.62, 12.7 or intermediate cartidges, armour seems to sponge bullets for absolutely no reason. - Why can I not drag wounded allies? Or carry them?  This game drives me insane because I wanted to like it so desperately. Each iteration in a series should build upon it's predecessor, and in many regards Arma III improved in many ways, but took so many steps back that I can't recommend this game to anyone.  Now ACE 3 definitely makes this game a lot easier to stomach, but the base game is still unfortunately there. It's unfortunately the only way I could say you should play this game if you're used to Arma II. I'm sure I'll get a lot of arguments from people saying that mods will fix X, Y and Z, but the fact is; Arma II didn't need fixing, so why should Arma III?
2439	1	a	Really Good game, with a large number of mods! Buy it and play it!
860	1	a	With almost 1.5k hours logged so far I can say this is the best game I have ever played.
5213	1	a	'I'm not going to pay this money for this game' - Totally not, you shouldn't. 1st you should get a better GPU, and I mean a VERY GOOD GPU, ARMA 3 still needs better optimization. 2nd wait for multiplayer fixes, it still has some desync insues here and there, multiplayer performance needs improvement. 3rd 'Why do i need ot wait for multiplayer fixes when i can play Singleplayer?' - Well ARMA is made for Coop action, and by this I mean join a clan/ group/ unit that knows how to play the game correctly. 4th Buy it and you will see it will be worth it!
166	1	a	A man robbed me for the keys to my quadbike, he then proceeded to drive my quad into a fence, causing the quad to explode.  10/10 Justice was served by an inanimate object
4917	1	a	supeer funny and super realistic
505	1	a	...I'm still playing this game.
2463	1	a	Great game. DL the Breaking Point mod.
2352	1	a	ArmA 3 brings a new aspect to gaming and to simulation gaming. Being a leading developer in military simulation BIS strived and excelled it's past accomplishments with ArmA 2 and it's DLCs. Me being in the military I enjoy this game. From playing ArmA 2, and it's DLCs, BIS has done a wonderful job with this one. From customizing your weapons to playing CAS in it's new A-164 Wipeout. ArmA 3 brings future warfare to today's technology.   Personal Rating: 09/10    Edited: 20140619
1109	1	a	The best in mil-sim-harcore-sandbox-â¥â¥â¥â¥ing-around-with-shooty-guns-and-tanks-games around.
4725	1	a	Great game! bad dlc content!
33	1	a	The game gives rather different experience than Age of Empires II, it's much more faster paced, the natural resources are limited, but you can get farms, plantiations and factories that produces them in unlimited amount. Also, you can capture trade outposts that allow you to get more experience needed for shipment's (which give additional units, resources or upgrades for your nation). Which those changes you are able to fight for longer, have bigger battles and in exchange - have more fun.  The unit combat is really sweet and enjoyable, mixing various types of units gives an edge in the battle, which means that spam blobs can be easily defeated if played right. The game is well balanced, even with weakest nation you are able to defeat any other nation, and if meele combat is your kink, you can have a lot of fun here.  The only con is that camera position is really really close to your units, and you can change it just by a little bit, which might be irritating, and when you alt+tab the sound options reset's so you have to change them again. Also, there is a lot of problems with multiplayer if you want to play via lan, which I still didnt figured out.
3652	1	a	Endless amount of fun. There are so so many different game modes. It's fun with friends or solo. The only thing you will have to worry about is the mentally â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ COD kids on wasteland servers.
2019	1	a	There's a key mapped to literally every function of the human body, not to mention your weapons, gear, and mentality. 11/10 would press 6 keys to look down iron sights again
3018	1	a	With the full release of Arma 3 the modding community kicked into full swing releasing stellar mods like ALiVE and JSRS2. The game can be challenging and even frustrating at times if you're not patient, but rewards planning and careful engagement with an immersive and fantastic experience.  The editor gives player the ability to create their own scenarios, from simple search and clear ops to convoy ambushes and combined arms operations, and makes this game infinitely replayable.  I would definitely recommend this game.
1183	1	a	You can play this title as a CoD/BF Shooter, a RTS, a MilSim etc. and its perfect in every of this senses! The game got made so that you can play it on every PC/Laptop you could imagine. It runs everywhere but of course the graphics aren't as good as on a gaming pc.  The game fearures (the in my opinion) biggest and greatest community ever. There are hundrets of great addons, and they are all free!  In conclusion: This game has everything for everyone. Deticated Server for LAN-Parties, very variable difficulty, great graphics, a giant open world, a free in-game editor and much more. Simply a must-have!
3361	1	a	Best game ever. My fav part is altis life &lt;3
2825	1	a	this game as the best fire fights they really get your blood pumping and its not about running and gunning u got to use strategy with your buddys. You got to be patient and wait for your target, its really a good looking game when your on a hill sniping down in to a town or in a jet or helo up above the clouds.
1577	1	a	I killed a guy because he had a cool hat.   10/10 Took the hats of his comrades as war trophies.
853	1	a	Want a game where you can do practically anything? A military simulator that can also turn into a horror experience, GTA-style free-world multiplayer maps, or Zombie post-apocalyptic wasteland. Recommended for single-player and multi-player fun, casual and hardcore style of play.
2171	1	a	Best mil-sim game ever, especially with 22GB's of mods.
4260	1	a	Arma 3's features in comparison to the previous Arma is sustantial. NPCs no longer have extremely odd path finding patterns, and animations are much smoother. The recorded voices for commands and such are more lively and smoother. NPC Dialogue or qeued dialoge seems more in-tone with the situation. Command voices for specific objectives run smoothly, and actually sound more pleasent. Bohemia Interactive really showed what they can do this time. 5/5
3546	0	a	Fun if you like hearing the F word over and over and over and over again. lol I miss the days when games where about great graphics, great stories and amazing sounds. now it seems like all game developers do is build there games around the bad language. not worth my time or money. deleted it after the first 10 min.
3979	1	a	one of the best
3918	1	a	THIS game is very fun and entertaining. with new mods coming out it makes it more interesting and creative.
5343	0	a	So I bought this game on the summer sale, it looks really hard in the trailers and in the gamplay reviews but, the controles are really messed up and its hard to do anything in the game. I think that when they make arma 4 they should put in normal controles and less controles like E should do more then just one thing. I really think that arma 4 should be a little less hardcore and more user friendly.  thanks
475	1	a	Arma 3 is the best game to have ever graced the Steam store. Anyone doubtful about the legitimacy of this claim have clearly never played Arma before. Buy this game, and don't think twice about it.
4780	1	a	Welcome to slow asthmatic jogging simulatar 2015.  From the constant retardation of your teammates to the never-ending kilometer long walks to the AO to just get killed by a random pistol round from some guy 2 kilometers away. I've listened to my soldiers heavy breathing for hours on end because he has the stamina of a 93 year old man. All vehicles will basically one shot you before you can figure out what 9+10 equals. I can't express enough how much I love it when every little bump and rock on the road will completly destroy any vehicle that isn't armoured. You also never know when the game might decide to fling your vehicle half way accross the map when you hit a rock. The lag on king of the hill at 120 players makes my eyes bleed and my head hurt. This game is just amazing!  11/10 would hit a rock at 15 km/h to fly 30 kilometers again.  But in all seriousness: I have always been a fan of the ARMA series because its really different than the other shooters. There are so many different ways to play this game, I spend hours scripting and fooling around in the editor for my own enjoyment. I don't play multiplayer that much but it's still a great experience when I get to it. This game is very heavily GPU and CPU dependant so I wouldn't recomend this to people who have a low-mid range gaming PC. Mid ranges might still be able to run it but you will get lots of FPS drops below 30 fps. This game is really fun and easy to get into. I am proud of the work that Bohemia Interactive is doing and continue to be a fan of their titles. The only problem I have with Arma 3 is the poor optimization of the game in multiplayer. Lag spikes and random fps drops sometimes make this game a real pain to play. I rate this game a 8.5/10.
1076	1	a	This game is very Hyper-Realistic.
2451	1	a	The best Fps Sim ever!
2443	1	a	According me it`s the best game in the world. I love this game.
1466	1	a	Great game! Would recommend to anyone who loves to play war games. 10/10 Would buy again.
1220	1	a	Good Realistic war game, BIg map, just buy it
4689	0	a	When I launch it, it just comes up with the thing with Parameters, and the other three options, HOW DO I GET INTO A MISSION OR MULTIPLAYER!!!!
277	1	a	An amazing game that has you hooked for many hours as your explore the campaign and the many DLCS and multiplayer mods that are on offer.
2910	1	a	10/10. A bit compicated. Great value for your money!
1591	1	a	I have played this countless of times already, its a fantastic military simulator shooter and i advise you to get it now. I hate to say this but it also has a DayZ mod on it as well now so if you dont wanna spend more money than you have and still want to kill zombies, here you go.  Arma3 is the 3rd in its line of duty, its range of weapons, customization, gameplay and combat are incredible and i highly recommend this. bring a microphone and teamspeak, you're going to need it!!!
1868	1	a	dont own the game but i can make a review
4432	1	a	The best tactic-shooter on the market. Really like it, especially the different gamemodes, for example king of the hill, or altis life. But even if you have a really good PC, it will still be a bit of laggy, it needs a lot of resources. 09/10
4955	1	a	Did not buy for military simulation experience. Bought to dress up as priest and role play with other like minded idiots. Was not disappointed. Would recommend.
5231	0	a	Over-priced, Over-hyped, Lacking in content - NOT WORTH IT. The developers re-use broken code from their earlier hits like Arma 2, Arma 1, Operation Flashpoint etc from 2001. The netcode is a DISASTER! Servers can barely handle more than 50 people and even then it's super laggy, rubber-banding and warping all over the place. The developers are now beginning to start releasing over-priced DLCs - 1. because they were too lazy to release the same content WHICH THEY SHOULD HAVE ANYWAY in the game initial release 2. without fixing the basic game, typical money-grabbing tactic.
4743	1	a	Dear Bohemia you guys made a nice game, yes. The cons are easily noticable, starting witrh the beta ready engine, (we all know this but still love it) The fact that you're money farming people for helo's dlc's and seeing if it works.  The fact you pander more for the life community side this time than the core fans.  But hey, you take what you can get.  It's still a good game if you can find a good unit to play with, and mods. Games legit worth is about $39,99 USD without the modding community.  I recommend this if you are someone who has a vast majority of free time playing Army Barbie or just a kissless virgin who never touched a woman and spends it playing out a simulation of a real life. If you're a core fan. don't bother 90% of core servers are hosted on 4gb of RAM
1728	1	a	Very in Depth and all inclusive.
2447	1	a	Fun game, a step up from the previous title
4329	1	a	COOL BUT APEX IS TOO EXPENSIVE!(
3278	1	a	Arma 3 is an amazing game! This game is great for anyone who likes shooters or RP games. This game is one of the best first person/3rd person games I have ever played. I have played Arma 2 and I have to say Arma 3 is so much better than Arma 2. The only problems about this games that really game to my attention is... First off glitches, they're not too bad but they can get annoying every now and then. Also servers is a big problem, there aren't many servers out there for a variety of gamemodes, the ones that I commonly see is Deathmatch or Battle Royale, Breakingpoint, King Of The Hill, and some others, but other than that this game is really fun and an enjoyable experience for players that are new or old to the 1st/3rd person shooter genre. I really recommend you get this game, especially if you're coming from Arma 2 or even Battlefield. Thanks! I hope I helped you out!
121	1	a	Drive in a Tempest truck at 100 km/h. Friend desyncs. Slam into back of his truck. Flip... sit there for a second... 'You're still ok' a friend says... ...and BAM! I blow up with a 300k truck with 300k worth of oil. Scream ALT+F4 while mashing keyboard. Launch arma Spawn with all my gear and oil in truck. 10/10 would play again
3752	1	a	Start playing arma Join invade and annex server play for 15 minues to capture zone Squad dies on defense pushed to edge of cliff under fire Try to jump off into water No jump button Die 10/10 Would fail to recreate lone survivor again 
5077	1	a	I have a crappy PC and this game runs like it's nothing, wtf?
656	1	a	Arma is a fun military simulator plagued by subpar organisation, lacking hardware optimization, and a laggy multiplayer. When things are going well, the game is extremely fun, but more often than not I have had a crash or two for no reason when in the heat of a firefight.
217	1	a	I remember playing this game after getting a taste of Arma 2 and i was so disappointed. I joined a Invade and anex server and got killed over and over by the super op aim hack AI. I was just about to rage quit, when one of the server group members asked me if i wanted to join their squad to play with them. They told me what to do and after an hour i got the sweet taste of Arma team play. I joined the group after a while and started playing user made missions with mods and holy â¥â¥â¥â¥. It has been the best year of gaming i have ever had. If you like millitary tactics and teamplay, Arma is right up your alley. It is not like any of the big fps's out there, you don't feel like a action movie super soldier. You feel just as vulnerable as the other guy on the receiving end of your barrel. If you are ever going to play this for the milsim part of the game, get yourself a group to play with. Nr. one advice.  I watch this every time I wonder why i play arma and I just want more:  http://youtu.be/y8oPEskvSAo 
2648	1	a	one of the best shooters out there and very realistic, an outstanding game.
3197	1	a	I love this game! :D
5310	1	a	This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing awesome.
1179	1	a	This game is just what you would expect from the Bohemia Interactive devs, a great game that is fun with a group of friends. You have many recuring mods in the ARMA series such as island life, wasteland, domination, and even an ARMA 3 port of DayZ, there is even a gamemode only in ARMA 3 called King of the hill. With the multiplayer basis out of the way what about singleplayer? ARMA 3 provides a story driven campaign, and a couple of showcases i.e. Infantry Combat, Aquatic Warfare, etc. ARMA 3 is also returning with a more user friendly mission editor/creator, here you can make your own missions that you or some friends can test out, or upload it to the Steam Workshop. Along with uploading you can also download others missions, some serious, some not. But other than that you should have a great time with this game. Now for the cons (every game has some) just as expected this game is extremely CPU intensive, and GPU intensive, so if you are getting this game make sure you have a good computer. P.S. FPS will be drastically higher in singleplayer compared to multiplayer i.e. SP 45-60 MP 15-30 depending on the server (some are crappy) BEWARE!
5395	0	a	Brain damage isn't the word.. If you love walking about hill sides &amp; empty towns for hours on end then by all means knock your self clean out. Really good graphics, Half decent engine but just awful gameplay. Trying to even see who is launching nades and rounds at you is a fecking personal nightmare. Could feel myself falling asleep in one game where a guy was flying for an hour with me in the back of a chopper.. and yes.. we met no enemy the entire time. 4/10 just for graphics
3865	1	a	Has a whole mess of amazing, and fun mods to play with, kind of like Mount and Blade: Warband. Basically it is Mount and Blade but with assault rifles... And tanks.
3386	1	a	Loving Arma 3. The A.I still... is either mentally challenged or trained by Seal Team 6. But still a great game.
2093	1	a	Its an awesome game for serious gamers who wants to play a army simulator
1504	1	a	.
4208	0	a	The game was released with very little content. Except for multiplayer it's not worth it, and even that is empty because of the lack of content they release the game with.  Good points would be the graphics, if your computer runs it ok. Even very powerful machines will have some issues with it. Community is great, modding is highly supported and the modding community is extremely active.  My conclusion would be to wait. Basically the game is in beta. The game WILL be amazing, however the state it's in now it's barren. Buy it when it's on sale, or in a year or so.
438	1	a	Arma 3 is jam-packed with many things to do. Although the campaign is quite slow, the multiplayer is what makes up for it. With tons of gamemodes to accomodate your own style, any type of FPS/Military fan is welcome to join the fun.
3760	1	a	Best â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Military Simulator out there. Only problem, terribly optimized game. SP Can run extremely well, but MP will destroy your frames. Get a decent PC before playing this. 
3145	1	a	Extremely fun and a bit of an adrenaline rush at times if you are playing wasteland or KOTH, recommend playing with a crew and get some comms up for the ultimate experience! I plan to spend more time pew pewing baddies and taking their loot! Quite and amazing amount of detail in the game, sometimes im amazed at the littlest things I see in game.
3237	1	a	Amazing Game, Jaw Dropping Graphics, Tons of Fun, but not worth $60. Perfect Game to buy when on sale!
3126	1	a	:D Game is worth it
3541	1	a	best military simulater out there lol
1228	1	a	I love this game
910	1	a	Great game, played on free weekend, runs well and great graphics, only wish I could've kept it longer.
3203	1	a	  Love this game to bits, love battle royale, love the coop, love all the gamemodes. But this game is buggy af. I keep getting crashes so buy with caution.
2925	1	a	Good game, I would recommend to players who are into military simulator. This game includes variety of guns and vehicles.
5317	0	a	the game is supper glichy
185	1	a	The Bohemia Interactive, well-known for the VBS series for the armies, have released the arma 3 as of september 13, 2013. It is a very renowned and creditable game because they showed their efforts to embody a variety of things in the game : constellations, military realities, and so on. We can easily find out about why it deserves to be popular.  We can create the mission by ourselves. This huge merit makes us to deal with enemies in a environment that continuously changes. Plus, we can play the game in various game missions, not a fixed ones.  Not only that, the addon system is a bonus factor that help us to enjoy the arma 3 in customised circumstances. You can imitate whatever you want using the addon system.  I want to say that you have to buy this game if you are reluctant to buy it. Given that arma series is a civilian eddition of VBS series, it is clear that this game is a perfact fit for you. I didn't mention lots of realities of arma 3 though.
4428	1	a	Takes me back to the days in 'nam
3449	1	a	Great mil sim. Can be play for eternity, thanks to mods and mission editor
799	1	a	!!!
520	1	a	This is by far the best game I have. It is so versatile it can be so many different things. The environment is huge and rivals most any other game in the genre. This is literally a war simulator complete with a mission editor. This game has given me the most fun with my friends for the dollar (besides Minecraft)
54	1	a	Oh man. Where to even begin with this one. It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooter, as it is so, so much more than that. Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that itâs developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But itâs even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come.   At its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together. New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the gameâs complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your â¥â¥â¥ depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience.   Out of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3âs two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewarding, and challenging. (I have yet to complete it as Iâm stuck on one mission that I simply canât seem to complete.)  However the single-player campaign is FAR from the end of this title. The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves.  Oh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). Iâm sure there are so many others that I havenât even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game.  In wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless.   Purchase this game. Purchase it now. Thank me later.   (IF YOU DO NOT FIND MY REVIEW HELPFUL, please leave a comment as to why. I welcome the constructive feedback.)
374	1	a	Hmm... I don't know , I think I need a few more hours to make a better review
1971	0	a	&gt;Flying at 1,300 meters &gt;Traveling at 500 knots &gt;single rifleman headshots me through canopy &gt;crash and burn 10/10
1848	1	a	Game is fantastic  there's so much to do and alot of options to handle a situation you could roll on a tank and â¥â¥â¥â¥ the place up or you could make friends and roll in a helicopter price is too high for this game i think but thats my opinion I DEFINATELY RECOMMEND THIS GAME play it. love it. live it. get your grades and social life down. (learn military lingo)
5361	0	a	This is gonna be â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥est game ever i see you dont make dayz mode for arma 3 But its not gonna happen u create new game for day z u published videos for u are working on arma 3 for dayz You guys said you are going to publish it soon u tricked people
3441	1	a	Great game, great mods, great community. Definitely one of my favorite games of all time.
1189	1	a	Awesome game, there is so much you can do here, everything from sandbox to tactical realism. Both the multiplayer and singleplayer areas have huge playability levels. Plus new content is being added weekly so you never get bored. Awesome game, one of my all time favorites. Highly recommend.
2460	1	a	best army game ever 10/10 trust me must buy!
3494	1	a	As good as computer gaming gets for military sims.
4485	1	a	The game is Great, but when I try to host my game crashes!!
4444	1	a	very good role play and domination game but note u need good computer (I AM GOOD)
2168	1	a	Why doesn't anyone want to play? Optimized and running smooth, best military simulation.  Update: Since release this game has slowly degraded into a low performing, buggy, storage hogging, memory leaking game. Unfortunately I still recommend this game because there is contention in wanting a well performing, immersive, and massive open world shooter. The survival mods of this game are what keeps it going.
795	1	a	A really fun game that is a great improvement compared to arma 2 when it comes to combat and animations as well as the variety of gamemodes. However, the game is a little 'unfinished' or requires a little more refurbishment when it comes to general points such as audio and factions (combat audio such as firefight sounds including distancing of gunshot sounds is disapointing). However, overall, the game is a deffinate must buy and some improvements can be made with few simple mods easy to download.
963	1	a	Best military simulator i've ever played. All it's missing is tons of weapons. But what it has is great!
4636	1	a	The game is very fun but the 20$ for a helicopter dlc is completely insane.
3574	1	a	this is awsome and i recommend it to others
2748	1	a	amazing game full of combat. nothing like call of duty were you run around and shoot many people. This game has so much land to explore and camp in maps to kill your enemies.
3443	1	a	Very fun to use. The graphics and realism aspect of the game is extreme. The firefights are intense, and it's easy to be immersed into the combat. The vehicle (Including Aircraft, submarines, helicopters) interiors are nice to look at as well.  Zues: Before this addon I couldn't get up close to watch a firefight without getting shot. This makes a great RTS, and a pleasurable theater of war.  Go Karts: I was kind of confused about this addon. 'A war simulator with Go Karts?' I got it, tried it out, and to be honest it wasn't that bad. Bohemia Interactive was trying something new. it was apreciated.
704	1	a	I think you know my opinions on this game.
136	1	a	Good, realistic.... f**k it, its ARMA 3-the best game ever 11/10
3100	1	a	Amazing. Graphics are very realistic. The Game play itself will be hard to grasp at first however after you have gotten the hang of it, it can indeed be very rewarding as well as realistic. Overall in general i would recommend arma to anyone who wants a true sandbox playground to engage in different military situations and other community made missions.
2406	1	a	Although it is riddled with simple movement glitches and errors the combat immersion is unmatched with most games. This game has given me many adrenaline rushes and jump scares that even horror games can't give. 8/10
689	1	a	This is the most intense game I have ever played... The combat is so realistic however, desync really ruin some of the longer range shooting in this game... None the less this is by far the best game I have ever played... If you are looking for tactical realism this is it... P.S: stay away from the trolls
1859	1	a	Good simulation game its like real life combat !!
1634	1	a	nice games   with high graphique  best thing playing oline with firend  online server best thing for me altise life  or dayz mod ...
785	1	a	This game is great it offers a wide variety of things to play and to whether your thing is role play or killing people just because u can. I'd recommend this game to nearly everyone who like fast pace shooter or zombie survival.
767	1	a	How to fully enjoy ARMA III In my oppinion:  1. Get a launcher to run it with (ArmaIIISync is great). That way you can tweak the performance so it runs properly, and it makes it easier to run mods. 2. Find a good clan to play with. I can heartily recommend the VDV-GRU if you like serious Mil-Sim experiences in a friendly enviroment, no matter your starting skill level. Be advised: we use a lot of mods, and we play as Russians, so be prepared for a lot of AK's and shooting at NATO-friendly forces. 3. Get some good mods to shape your arma Experience the way you like.  Have fun!  Sincerely, Efreitor Hansen , Bravo LMG, 1. Squad, C-Company, 45th Light Recon Detacthment of the VDV (Russian airborne) (Arma titles, not real life)
2762	1	a	well wtf this game is amazing its hard AT TIMES but over all really good i have a â¥â¥â¥â¥ pc ok 20 fps is ok but over all u can run it and its a sick game
2618	1	a	Great Game!
2819	1	a	I love this game there is always so much to do I never get bored.
5148	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. They flood the loot tables with DLC weapons, attachments, ammo varients and clothing and expect you to purchase the DLC on the spot. Hell no. Not recommended unless you love having watermarks on your screen and a constant prompt to waste your money on DLC, that, in total, adds up to the same cost of a triple A title.
5092	0	a	Another day, another ArmA game, another load of bugs and lags. Don't expect this game to run well if you want a solid 60 FPS, it will always find a way to ruin your performance. I'm constanlty monitoring hardware usage and ArmA III lags even while not loading my CPU or GPU above 70% (I'm running the game on a 6 Gb/s SSD). I cannot help but compare this game with Battlefield 4 that runs almost perfectly well. I do realize that BF4 isn't running a whole load of AI and scripts plus its maps and object count are much lower but somehow I feel DICE could do optimization much better than BIS. Seriously, what excuse would you have for a game that lags without hardware bottlenecks (so it seems)? I'm definitely not recommending this game as I'm absolutely convinced that steady performance is above fancy visuals. I've tried all kinds of performance tweaks for this game - launch parameters, custom memory allocators, edits in the .cfg and .ini files, unparking the CPU cores, changing process priority, messing with settings &amp; etc. All they do is give you a tad of extra FPS and nothing more. No tweak will change the fact that ArmA III uses a 32-bit executable and obsolete overcoded engine with no proper multicore support.  On the other note, I don't really like the pseudo-futuristic setting of this game. It's indeed pseudo-futuristic as most all present equipment is denied prototypes or current tech that has nothing futuristic about it except being exotic. Mid-2030s? Even while not being a mil expert I understand that realistic portrayal (isn't this what a tactical shooter is about?) of this age is not possible as we have no idea of technology that's going to be used at the time. Scopes with built-in rangefinders and auto adjustment? That's something already created, greatly promising and not even present in this bogus - same as triton oxygen mask, google glasses, smart bullets, thermal goggles and even real time active spectral matching camouflage (EDIT: The current version now includes Nightstalker Scope that has a built-in rangefinder). A3 setting ended up on the side of cheap pulp fiction. That's not really a major problem since I'm looking forward to mods like ACE 3 and RHS Escalation that should reintroduce the modern stuff by adding new or converting old assets, and it's really good to note that EULA and A3 engine allow this.  The game wields many improvements over ArmA II. The inventory system is marvellous, radio comms sound much more like live chat, visuals, animations and sounds are vastly enhanced but is that really enough when the game often lags like hell because it's purely unoptimised?  A3 is too expensive for its content quality, but I may change my mind if devs manage to improve its performance. However it's unlikely they ever will. The way I see it, in order for ArmA III not to lag BIS will have to code a new but reverse compatible engine on the basis of DirectX 12 with proper multicore support and a 64-bit executable.    http://img.leprosorium.com/2096814  Pathetic performance: core usage, RAM usage, GPU usage and video memory usage. The game barely used 50% of availiable computing power, horrific 22 FPS are of course the result. The only solution is to lower the viewdistance and object distance to the point where whole world turns into a permanent hazy â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ like your Silent Hill. Needless to say that flying aerial vehicles becomes a questionable undertaking.
186	1	a	my girlfriend bought me this...... 6 months later she said it's either arma 3 or her.... damn im gonna miss her.....  great game  would ex-gf again.  11/10
511	1	a	If you are considering buying Arma 3 for the multiplayer there are a few things you should know... About the multiplayer: There are several modes of multiplayer. There's Life, which is like an role playing type scenario. There's Wasteland, which is like DayZ but without zombies. There's also the several military combat oriented multiplayer modes. Multiplayer can be rewarding, but the Arma community is extremely diverse in the way people play their game. There are some casual players, but you will also encounter real military simulation enthusists. If you like to have fun, I suggest you approach the latter group with some degree of caution. They're not all bad, but I have run into some that have Units (Arma's term for clans) that do uniform inspections, boring training and, in one case, would not admit women to their unit because it wasn't 'realistic'. Just remember, if you're not having fun then it isn't worth your time and you should immediately ditch those people that are being such a drag. Other then that, the multiplayer can get quite laggy, but you can usually find another server to play on if that's the case. And bring a book because you can expect a lot of downtime in some modes of multiplayer.  The game itself is a bit buggy. It can break your immersion at times, but when it really counts (in firefights) it rarely glitches out on me. This is a CPU intensive game. If you have a so-so processor but a good video card you may have to do some tweeks to make the game run in a satisfactory manner.  Overall, I enjoy it a bunch. There's a lot to learn and I'm quite happy with the game.
634	1	a	Great game I love Arma 3 life 
2508	1	a	Love it
2280	1	a	It's a pretty good driving simulator if that's what your looking for. On top of the endless bugs, explosions, and hikes, you'll find tons of different gamemodes and mods. The modding community really holds this together and without them this would probably be a piece of trash. After the first ten minutes, using the three guns supplied in the vanilla version of this game will get boring. This game is unfinished and shouldn't be bought.   I give it a 10/10
356	1	a	There are no real words, its just great a proper simulation of ground warfare. Been a player since the first Operation Flashpoint and loved its mission editor and the ability to mod and end up with all manner of scenerios and missions from the campaign that comes to the game to entire vietnam mods for the old ARMA, to playing UN peacekeer to being a civilian just trying to survive.  So much great stuff, its not a run and gun like COD its an open sandbox so crack open that creativity and have as much fun making as you can playing.
1260	1	a	Very great update compared to arma2
4071	1	a	I love the Altis life game mod + This game looks so beautiful. And this game is much better then gta.
921	1	a	By far the best sandbox shooter to ever come out. The game is enriching and engaging, there is no shortage of mods and the game keeps getting better by constant developer updates and the community contributions. Everyone in their right mind who claims to be a PC Gamer should play this game.  Bohemia's dedication to the developement and improvement of this game is astonishing, one of the very few developers who actually keep their word of 'constant updates' and 'community oriented updates,' the game has come a LONG way and the way it's going with the HUGE level of content I can only wait to see what else the developer's has in store.
5290	1	a	Good game i like it ,but there is bugs.
1688	1	a	Buy it. Now.
1940	1	a	Possibly my favourite game of all time! yep I said it!  ARMA has so much going for it, large sandbox environments, a wealth of community created and official content, a great editor in the right hands and couple that with a good clan and your set for gaming life! Yes it has its bugs and yes the single player isn't the greatest but the multiplayer Co-ops enjoyed with the right group of people will bring you an experience that no other game or community can currently match. This is the game that keeps on giving and brings me back to PC gaming again and again....consoles have no answer to this game...back to PC gaming then :)
2785	1	a	Made an ac-130 with tanks and a small plane... 11/10 -ign
1150	1	a	+1 plus one for me great game when it comes to the mods... my heart has never jumped out of my chest from pvp in a long time...
1267	1	a	Arma 3 makes big steps forward with a huge world and more vehicles and weapons. This time around its trump card is Steam workshop integration though, making downloading mods effortless. A smart move by Bohemia Interactive because it are those mods that will give Arma 3 its long lifespan. Unfortunately Arma 3 is quite inaccessible and doesn't seem to grow along with modern game design on certain fronts. Space time and perseverance are your best friends here, until Bohemia's support starts paying off.
1425	1	a	If you are after the best war game, look no further. ARMA3 is it:)
2376	1	a	Arma 3 is a great open world Simulation Military Shooter. It's not like your normal run and gun shooter. The game focus more on the realistic side where tactics and team work is key on being successful. Arma 3 give you a large variety and options, kind of like battlefield 4. Youâre able to be just a random grunt or you can fly a helicopter (not as easy as other games) or drive a tank. Bohemia Interactive did a great job on the graphics of the game as well, it can be hard to find camouflaged players that are not moving unless you have thermal optics or what not. I recommend this game to more of the hardcore gamers who looks for a realistic game. I donât recommend it if your just trying to find a shooter to pop in and out like counter-strike.
3996	1	a	Good army game, you can actually kill vehicule with rocket unlike Battleshit 4 where you can heal tank with electrical screwdriver that are more powerfull than rockets. 9/10
4013	1	a	Any sane person would say this game is bad... I am not sane. This has got to be the most fun I've had with a game in a long time.
3298	1	a	One of the best games i've ever played. 10/10 Love it. Will play it for years to come.
2706	1	a	If I've spent 1400+ hours playing Arma 3 over a period of just six months that must be a good indication.
5002	1	a	Overall this game is very realistic,fun and tactical ideal to play with friends; This game is solely for people who love Military Simulation and Realsim please if you are one of these people I only have one thing to say. GET THIS GAME! :D
2590	1	a	This is a very awesome game. It should be called military simmulator because it is very realistic. Also it is a very demanding game on your hardware, Loved it. I will buy it in the next few weeks.
943	1	a	While I do recommend this game, it's only thanks to Arma's modding community. And well in advance. Because, while there already are some very good mods and missions for Arma 3, the vast majority of them simply is additional content ported over from Arma 2.   As for the game itself in its vanilla form: thumbs down. Bad net code, bad design, awful single-player campaign, terrible bugs (like AI twitching when you hit them with your fire). Technologically Arma 3 is stuck in 2009. Graphics don't age well, it already looks outdated, while being very demanding resource wise - bad optimization.  Unfortunately, Arma 3 doesn't have any competition in simulating combined arms warfare. While every aspect of Arma 3 is done poorly, it's the only game that comes with all of it in one package.
2339	1	a	One of the best and most realistic modern shooters out there. Great online content and community. Good campaign. Amazing graphics. Well worth the money if you're looking for an open world, modern shooter.
195	1	a	Arma 3. a completely unique and fun game, giving a huge variety of scenarios, gut wrenching gameplay, with a huge sence of realizm blows COD, Halo, and Battlefield out of the water. I kiss COD, Halo, and Battlefield goodbye. this is Arma. having no same exact mapped mission. with no same exact scenario, with two Gigantic islands, and alot to explore, from controls, to different ways to approach things, everything is so much more realistic to any other first person shooter, for ground gameplay to taking to the skies in an A-10 or Huey attack helo. has so much more to offer. adding underwater combat, volumetric simulation, and Authentic FLIR imaging. gives a experience worth living for, takes the player right into battle at the comfort and warmth of you'r home.  the community is gigantic giving huge amounts of content the community creates for a quick subscribe and free download. giving multiplayer a boost to a stunning 100 player scenarios. goodbye 64 player servers.  and yes. the Arma 3 community has quite a bit to offer.  OPS on ground are stunning. having that adreniline rush of bullets whizzing past you or the curiosity to find where you're getting shot at from. Arma 3 supports a simulated person. not a gun with a hitbox, having 15 different ways to get out of sight. and to return the fire. the ways to call support and the ways to provide it are incredible. there are also many species of wildlife you can run into such as, goats, snakes, bunnies, dragonflies, and butterflies, Arma 3 completely excels on ground ops.  OPS in air arent DCS world realistic, but are still realistic to its point. thanks to volumetric clouds, volumetric fog, and randomized weather chages gives Air OPS a huge advantage and disadvantage in different situations, different vehicles to take flight in means different ways to support squad and teammates in the battlefield. the wildlife here is birds. but flying is fun, yet can be very dangerous, wear you're seatbelts!  OPS in water such as in boats or even diving are both very fun, might as well veetoh COD:GHOSTS fish A.I. a huge veriety of killable wildlife such as eels, fish, seaturtles, and sharks. also with the many different passenger and assult boats. having that ability to choose what kind of vehicle you want can give you the upper hand.  OPS in armor such as tanks, imidiately makes you feel like a badass, rolling through with an M1-Abrahms platformed tank, makes you feel the most powerful thing on the battlefeild, then you have things like a pickup truck with a 50. BMG HMG that seemed good but you got blown up. alot of things have the upper and lower hand, as said many times depending on the situation, but before i let you go, try not to hit the bunnies, what did they do to you...?  Arma 3 has definately alot to look forward to in the up coming years, i hope this review was helpful, and at the same time confirms you to join the Arma 3 community. im not saying too much of everything, so you the reader has to play the game to find out more  but remember.  MAKE ARMA NOT WAR!!!
3905	1	a	My Quick review.  Arma 3 is probably the most user friendly entry into the series. Not to the mention the best looking, and in my opinion the most fun to play.  Now, thats not to say doesn't have issues. CURRENTLY, not as much content as the previous entries, but that said, BIS is working on more and its soon to come. Obviously the modder community is working feverishly away.  Steam workshop support for missions is great, and as soon as they add support for full Mods, everything will be even better.  The game plays as one would expect. Its a tactical simulator, so that means the average expericance wont be a firefight every few seconds. Tehre is waiting, there is walking, but if you're of the right mindset, it all adds to the experience and build up. Knowing only a few shots can kill you make it quite tense.  Key points- -The new stance system is great, a variable height and lean, means you can make the most out of any cover you find yourself in! - The maps are huge and varied, with the scenario editor you can quickly whip up any type of engagement you want. - The game is better multiplayer, if your more of a Solo player, I wouldn't say you'll have no fun, but I think it'd be more limited. - So many mods on the horizon, all will add up to be the experience you want, tailored to you.  So, all that said, I love this game. Devs are continuining support with regular updates and additions. Join a multiplayer community and prepare to have a blast!
440	1	a	Perfect for OPERERATING OPERATIONALLY IN AN OPERATIONAL OPERATION.
4860	1	a	It's a very good game and lots of fun, especially with some of the mods you can download.
4560	1	a	any 1 givin arma 3 away i would be most gratefull 
1603	1	a	After playing this game for 600 hours in different types possible (e.g.- Altis Life, Wasteland, Epoch and also Milsim with some cool people). If it would be possible to go back and not buy this game, I would not go back. Yes its addictive. Yes its fun if your playing with the right people.  I really recommend this game!
3793	1	a	if u have an amazingly good processor and graphics card this game is for u
360	1	a	Spend 3 days hiding in a bush, get shot by someone you can't see.  10/10
3875	1	a	Definitely one of my favorite military themed games of all time. I've had countless of fun experiences, intense firefights, and have met some interesting people. I would suggest this to anyone who is looking for a different experience, far away from COD or Battlefield. Vanilla I would say is a 7.5 (out of ten), and with mods a 9 out of ten. Fantastic.
3447	1	a	Really cool game if you are used to shooter games. It is very intense and realistic, you can get killed pretty quickly and vehicles can blow up easy. Also the maps are very beautiful and great to explore with lots of hiding spots. Arma 3 has a large range of weapons that can suit all playing styles so I highly recomend it for people who are reasonalbly experienced at shooter games.
2915	1	a	11/10 not worth it. Stole my life. Calculated out, so far has taken 102 days of my life, more to come. Please send help
549	1	a	best game in my life
2982	1	a	I Bought this game quite a while back and i am glad i did, I Have had so much fun playing it with all the differant life servers and mods for the game. Would recomend it to anyone
550	1	a	very loud indoor sounds with army men with big loud guns who shoot and kill you without even seeing you and why do i need to press every key on my keyboard in a certain order just to reload nothing makes any sense also war dads who take this game very seriously and will get mad if you call their squad lame and say yours is better and cooler
581	1	a	this is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing nice game !
1574	1	a	ArmA has come a long way from the days of Operation Flashpoint and it shows here. ArmA 3 can only be what your imagination is limited too, with many different game mods, servers galore and regular updates to both for what can only be a massive community of gamers.  In ArmA 3 it is completely okay to play the game how you see fit, from behind iron sights taking cover behind a row of rocks or from 1km away looking down the glass of a .50Cal, you might be a medic and you've made it to your patient but now your out of life saving items; the tactics are incredible and the smoke has real effect but be careful because it works both ways and you may be flanked with amazing efficiency.  Are you a pilot? or Diver? Perhaps you might get enjoyment out of servicing other players ensuring that they are upto date and fully stocked with the stuff they need for their mission, whilst someone out is calling for a Casavac/Medivac or a gun run to help out the ground troops.  This game is what you make out of it and has endless possibilities within the vanilla game and thousands of modifications for free... Try it out, reach out to strangers play how you want, when you want, as what ever class of soldier you want.  ArmA 3 the game of possibilities 9.8/10
3283	1	a	The latest in the ArmA series, this is the best military simulator out there, and it sure does live up to the hype, with a fantastic graphic upgrade.  Apart from just upgrading the graphics, it has created 2 new maps for you to go crazy on in this sandbox military simulator where quite literally, the sky is the limit.   Engaging Close Quarters Combat, entertaining infantry combat with a load of other people and AI with vehicles to back you up, the amount of scenarios you and your friends can experience is endless, due to the thriving community that has come from ArmA 2 and Operation Arrowhead, to make these games even better.   Whilst even without any mods, this game still lives up to the standard that is expected from Bohemia Interactive in this long running series of military simulator/sandboxes. They added new movement, new weapons, new vehicles. Whilst no classic weapons like the M4/M16/AR15 series don't make a return, along with the AK47/74/74su, they are replaced with new weapons that are more towards the future.  The game itself is set in 2035, when the Republic of Altis and Stratis is facing a civil war, NATO comes in and attempts to help the AAF in the war against CSAT, they are turned on and the AAF teams up with CSAT to destroy NATO forces in this gripping fight between yourself and loads of tough AI.  In this futuristic settings, along with new weapons, new toys have been added to your arsenal to mess about with. New vehicles include submarine type transport vehicles, amphibious armoured personnel carriers, and scuba-diving equipment. It all totals up to a crazy sandbox experience with a load of missions and scenarios from the community, from Altis Life to Wasteland.
3483	1	a	Not the best city builder I've ever played, but it did quite a good job at simulating modern military combat
3551	1	a	A solid sequel to Arma 2 but would fall short if it hadn't been for the workshop support.  Arma 2 with operation arrowhead is full of different vehicles and weapons for each faction not to mention some really great maps. Meanwhile Arma 3 does some stupid â¥â¥â¥â¥ and makes the CSAT and NATO tanks very similair and reuses their chassis for other vehicles. I understand that reusing the same chassis is supposed to make it futursitic but I think it's â¥â¥â¥â¥ing boring.  - Post-Modern military theme is cool - Customization of loadouts - Easy to get workshop mods - Workshop quality control is non-existent - Vehicles are alright - They push their mods and expansions in the most annoying way possible - UI and FPS controls are improved - Maps are alright but nothing that really stands out or is very memorable - Runs similarly to Arma 2 despite looking much better -
273	1	a	Cod is for kids Battlefield is for teens  Arma is for MEN!!!
2002	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ play COD  Boys play battlefield   Real â¥â¥â¥â¥in men with balls play arma
3405	1	a	Really good game go check it out
3600	1	a	Pass the  weed  PTSD
4732	1	a	Really Good Game, Thats For Sure!!
1066	1	a	Do yourself a favour... Buy this game
108	1	a	I don't even have this game, why is it allowing me to write a review?   EDIT: And as of 5/8/15, I now own the game.
4664	1	a	Very fun game you can have custom missions but also the 3 fun multiplayer gamemodes life, king of the hill, and wasteland each has its special perks
3098	1	a	IF you never played operation flashpoint, arma 1 , arma 2 , day z mod , day z standalone, or any other military shooter this game is not for you and if you have, this is the best military simulator ever made.
4722	1	a	The best game Ewer
1516	1	a	By far one of the greatest sims I've ever played, I'm unable to join the military but this is what I think it would feel like, a must buy!
55	1	a	I spent several years in the army and I gotta say this game is spot on with the training and atmosphere the military provides. I love how difficult this game is, and I love all of the different features the game provides. It is NOT easy to hit a target with an assault rifle from 300 yards in real life, and this game seems to match that same difficulty. Fatigue is a real thing and it seriously hinders your accuracy in real life...Arma 3 makes you stop and catch your breath if you run too far or carry too much gear, or you will have a hard time hitting your target. Enemies are not stupid and they have great vision. I was engaged by two enemies from about 200 yards away and they were using bushes for cover as well as 3-5 second rushes when moving. The AI is more advanced than the average taliban are in real life. haha :p Given my love for the military and for videogames, this one is definitely one of my favorites of all time :D
2024	1	a	Realistic modern-war simulator to date. Although it is notorious for it's poor optimization (mostly in multiplayer), the game runs well in singleplayer if the recommended system requirements were met.
1690	1	a	Arma 3 is a unique military simulation game with many other elements of gameplay. The variety of gamemodes add so much content for you to enjoy! I have over +1000 hours on this game and have seen every corner of what this game has to offer. You can complete the awesome storyline, play on a variety of servers, or create your own world using the editor. I've had a great time playing this game with friends and you probably will too!  Multiplayer: 9/10 Singleplayer: 9/10
2125	1	a	Most played game EVER
333	1	a	Complex but fun especially if you have friends to play with.  - I didnât like it in the beginning I found it rigid and complex, mainly because I was comparing it to the other FPS games in the market  + Very good gameplay + Fancy graphics and physics are good + huge community contribution  - You will walk a lot and you will be lost in the beginning   I recommend it :)
3099	1	a	CUP addons fixed nearly every complaint I had with this game. Still poorly optimized, but that's ARMA for you.
2580	1	a	this games is awesome, just the amount of stuff you can do because of all the diffrent mods and game modes there are. if you like first person shooters this is the one you should get.
5147	0	a	quite meh to be brutally honest
1944	1	a	One of the first games I've had to be sober to play, I was worried that if I wasn't everyone would look at me as a s****ty soldier. It feels that real. The only thing missing is Article-15's.
5243	1	a	I love this game,It's make me feel like a solider in a big, very big battlefield
1317	1	a	I only played a little bit. Made my own planes, helicopters and stuff :P
899	1	a	arma 3 is the best simulator out yet!!! recomended for everyone:D 
4839	1	a	Arma 3 packs a full punch, improving on all aspects of Arma 2. From the weapon system, the flow of your character, or even the smallest thing such as your side mirrors and rear view mirrors in your car actually work. Pick this game up. You will not be disappointed.
537	1	a	Gonna be the best ever....already great.
4275	1	a	The best ever! Arma Life is my favorite.
4130	1	a	Loved it, After the success of Cooking Mama and League of Legends the developer Activision shines down on us with the masterpiece that is this game (Gears of Halo Thef Auto 5) and with its staggering 69 dlc packs all priced at $4.20 you'd be a fool not to try this game out. Insomniac Games really outdid themselves on this one. 8/6 would eat without package.
5284	1	a	Just get it and stop looking down here...
1394	1	a	So real I got PTSD 
922	1	a	One of the best games i ever played.
2608	1	a	A must to have if you like combat simulation. To increase even more the immersion i also suggest to install mods like ACE3 or Task Force Radio
1412	1	a	This game has everything! 9/10
368	0	a	This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t on so many levels. 1. The AI hasnt improved since Operation Flashpoint In 2001 (Still a Better Game than this) 2. You are berated with pop up ads on your screen which dont go away untill you buy the overpriced DLC that they advertise. 3. Your vehicles stop working when you do so much as tap a rock with one. 4. Most servers are cancer that will kick you for doing anything against their unlisted and crappy listed ones. (Ala DarkRP) 5. Overpriced DLC (Seriously? $15 for 3 Helicopters?) 6. Too much focus on graphics and other gimmicks  Never buying another Arma game until Bohemia gets their **** together. Go buy the much cheaper and much better Operation Flashpoint Instead.
4425	1	a	Arma 3 is like its predecessors. When Bohemia launched it (I mean after Alpha and Beta Phase) it was still incomplete, lacking content (for example: I mean the biggest Island ever and only one Jet for a minor Fraction the AAF) and Bug riddled. So nothing changed, Behemia is still greedy and the community has to bring it arround. Wich it does! Missions Mods everything is comming from you guys! Thanks for that.
3991	0	a	Terrible multiplayer optimization with those who have AMD chips. Running an 8 core bulldozer AMD CPU with 8GB of DDR3 and a R9 270x and I cant get over 15-20Fps tops while online (no matter the server). Terrible. Its a known issue with this game engine, but it looks like there isnt any hope in site in the near future. Otherwise I think id like this game. I really have no use for the single player, so im not sure about it. I do know its playable on most rigs, even AMD ones. But I bought this one for the MP and I cant play it, so....not sure how good it is gameplay wise really. (PS-its not just my setup that causes these issues either. I couldnt run it any better with my AMD FX-6100 6 core with samsung DDR3 and a HD 7770 GPU).
4307	1	a	Arma 3 is brilliant, but the Linux release of the game is still on v1.42, with the Windows release on v1.5, I cannot play on any multiplayer servers :/ 10/10 once they support updates to the Linux client
4959	1	a	You don't have it already? Just get it. It's the best thing on Steam, hands down.
419	1	a	9/10   A fantastic game from Bohemia Interactive, honestly the only thing lacking is some real weaponry used today. It seems a tiny bit too fictional but mods can sort that :)
3158	1	a	damn this is is my new drugs, #LUKATDEMHRSONREKORTSON
2503	1	a	Great game.
4946	1	a	Arma Arma Arma.   Live like the original U.S.A Soldier Life.
422	1	a	With over 470 hours so far in this game all I can say is awesome!!!!!!
908	1	a	This is a lovley game. I have trouble finding immersion in games but this game is where its at. I can sit an play this game for hours on end and not get bored. Has an amazing story and the multiplayer is just great. There is zero reason to not have this game. 11/10 Amazing job Bohemia.  *Note even though it has some bugs i only find those relevent in multiplayer and its not even that bad. Doesnt take away from the game at all in my opinion.
2109	1	a	let's go for another 1000! :D
4641	1	a	It's good, get it.
1036	1	a	Best MilSim Sandbox. It's got it's flaws but the positives outweigh by far.  You kinda need some mods to get all the maps back into the game and fight the stupid fatigue system. But in return you get hundrets of hours of gameplay especially if you're with a milsim community.
3230	0	a	this game is glitch
1385	1	a	Altis Life- Stole a helicopter, Took a man hostage, Landed, Got chased by the police, Got captured, Got charged with Grand theft auto, Evading police and rekless flying and got put in prison for 10 minutes... 10/10 Would take hostage again...
2773	1	a	Needs a pretty buff computer to play well, I had a lot of lag because my computer didn't reach the requirements. But that's pretty much my fault, not the game's. It's pretty good.
5051	1	a	This game a dream come true for military enthusiast the combat is brutal a punishing some time I jump when I make unexpected contact with the enemy I find my self feeling real fear something I've ever felt playing a war game Arma 3 gets a 10/10 from me.
4979	1	a	I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hate this game yet I'd buy every single DLC made.
3321	1	a	great game with excellent potential to keep adding worlds
595	0	a	Optimisation? Forget it. My CPU (i7 2600k) and GPU (GTX 780) works at half of their load. 20-40 fps with all the time stuttering is all i got. Changing of settings does not affects on FPS. I'd like to play this. but I can't because of performance.  So, BOHEMIA, we bought Arma 3 Apex DLC, that's for sure. When Arma 3 Optimization DLC coming?  UPD: Got Gigabyte G1 GTX 1070 and another 8Gb RAM (it is 16Gb now)... Same crap fps. So, people who told me to upgrade... Just dont :D
2228	1	a	Oh yes ArmA 3, one of my favorite games on steam! I dont have almost 300 hours on it for nothing. This is a military simulation game that is set around 2025. But they did not over do it and set it in the future where theres space ships and all that. Even know it does not feel like the ArmA 2, in the way that it is not feeling like it is a true military game, with all the tactics that arma 2 had. But other than that one problem that I have. (Lack of content to) It turned out to be a very fun game that me and my friends love to play. So much to do as in multiplayer, steam workshop with so much into it, you can even get creative with it like my hunger games mission! All in all very fun!
887	1	a	Half the time I don't know what I'm doing or who i'm trying to kill.
2007	1	a	Bought Arma 3 for Altis Life Mod. Became a rebel. shot a cop for chasing me. saved people from going to jail. Made a gang. done a drug run. got robbed.   10/10 ign
4819	1	a	Dont buy this trash game, Looks good on streams looks and sounds fun as F! but the game is trash! FPS chop all servers in games with 1-24 players i got like 100fps + all max settings games with 70-100 people i got like 20-40 fps chopping also the game lags alot the mic chat is GODAWFUL annoying! people in global chat with there mics lagging bad due to severs. The game is worth 10-20$ tops until they fix the problem they never fixed in arma 2 or never will fix cuz they suck at scam money from people. Worst game of the year No joke
1381	1	a	The most polished, smooth ARMA experience yet and its still in alpha. The upgrade to beta then full release looks like it will only be more content as I have yet to find any bugs. If your an ARMA fan this is a must buy
1479	1	a	  'Arma 3, definitely one of the best games I've ever played!'    Next to the game 'Assassins Creed III' is 'Arma 3' truly one of the best games I've ever played, and it is definitely worth the money! It has a lot of features and a huge amount of possibility's. I've played it for almost 70.0 hours now, and I only played in the editor for now, I didn't even started the campaign yet.  First I thought that there whould be a huge difference between Arma 2 and Arma 3, but besides the grahpics (which are amazing) and the campaign, the game is almost the same as it's previous version. However the makers of Arma 3 did a great job by improving all the gameplay experiences and possibility's,   Some changes between Arma 2 and Arma 3:  - Customise your weapons. - Customise your player, like changing clothes and more. - Submarine and swimming underwater/diving suits. - Amazing improved graphics.  But there are also some dissapointing things,  In Arma 3 I really missed some airplanes and ships. However, I'm using some modifications right now like the 'USS Nimitz' and the 'F/A-18 Super Hornet'. Those modifications really make the game  more than perfect.   A game like Arma 3 for just â¬44,99,- is just amazing, and will never be a waste of money, and time. It really one of the best games ever made, and you won't have much problems while playing.    10/10, AMAZING GAME!  
909	1	a	Really amazing game Massivly Multiplayer Plus Online Mods.
1918	1	a	Played the Altis life mod.... ran into a safe zone with a bunch of cops, got arrested for no reason.. Got put into a police car (They have no idea what's about to happen) i had weed on me... I smoked the weed in the police car, infront of all the cops... then.... Boom, the car exploded and all the weeds was gone :(

3619	1	a	Arma 3 is one of the few games you can get for a few bucks (18â¬ summersale 2016 -without DLCs) and in wich you can spend months of playing and still have fun
565	1	a	Well what i can tell, Arma 3 its one of my favorite games of all time and i have with my 1800play hours the right to say that this game is one of the best games of alltime. Here are some reasons why.  The game has a great community of modders and contentcreators its a game you can really play for ever and i can just recommend it to everyone im sure you find something you like.  Enjoy ;)
248	1	a	Lets put it this way. The game is exelent. The only thing i dont like is the fact that it takes about 3 bullets in the brain to kill someone.
3491	1	a	I bought a brand new gaming desktop just so I could play it on 'Ultra'  No number can describe this game's greatness  Infinity/0 
4933	1	a	Won my first Arma 3 BR, 15th Oct. feelsgoodman, great game.
5038	1	a	My fav thing to play when I want to cry and die at the same time.
1882	1	a	Experiences in ARMA 3:  1) Our arma regiment uses a modded server, including a new map, ace (which adds some depth to the medical system and some other nifty features), TaskForceRadio (people must be close to each other or have a radio at the correct frequency to communicate) a bunch of new items, vehicles etc.  The Zeus/GM/HQ/leader of the regiment who sets up and manipulates our scenarios on the fly gives us our next mission. We're going to insert via helicopter near an enemy (All enemy is AI) base and take it over. We get our equipment together (I take medical supplies, as medic) and mount up.   We have our usual banter as we approach the landing site, our Zeus directs the AI pilots of the helo to land but the AI just keeps going, either because they think we are being shot at or because they can't figure out how to land at the designated point.   We're now passing over the point, going into enemy territory. I think our Zeus realises this and commands everyone to bail. Now we're being shot at, I start getting my parachute from the helicopter's inventory. Out of the corner of my eye, I see bullets light up the cockpit and one of the pilots slumps forward, the helicopter descends. I replace my backpack full of medical supplies with the parachute and prepare to jump... but now the helicopter is too low. If I jumped now, I'd probably fail to open my parachute soon enough and injure myself severely, so my only choice was to wait 'till the helicopter was low enough and just hope I don't get shot as I get out.   I dismount as it's about to touch the ground and bullets start smacking the helicopter from the side that I had gotten out. I quickly run around to the other side without taking any injuries. Our squad has landed in a clearing that is surrounded by forest, in a kind of Y shape, with our squad at the intersection of open area. We're all spread out along this clearing, and the enemy has surrounded us entirely. A couple of our men were already dying and more were going to follow. I hear over the radio our Zeus and another team leader call for a retreat back to the base, but with so many enemies around us, that was near impossible.   I stay behind the helicopter, trying to spot enemies from my position, but with only gunfire as my indicator, it was near impossible to know exactly where the bullets were coming from.  I remember that I've left all of my medical supplies in the helicopter, which I need since people are getting shot to â¥â¥â¥â¥, so I go up to the door and see if I can reach the inventory inside. I can't, unfortunately, so the only way I was going to get those supplies was to hop inside the back and expose myself to gunfire. One of my squad-mates, a marksman, obviously has the same idea, he probably left his ammunition and bandages behind after grabbing a parachute. He hops in and I follow suit, I quickly close the door, grab my bag and get out. Great, now I can actually be of some use, since I can't see where the â¥â¥â¥â¥ these guys are shooting from (I could've used the map to see them, but I feel like that's kinda cheat-y).   I take a look around, still trying to spot enemies, but I just can't see them, so I give up trying to fight back and bolt it toward one of my team-mates (the marksman from before). (By this time, there were only like three or four of us left.) He was patching himself up, so I helped him out by bandaging him up a little. We're both switching between prone and crouching stances, trying to shoot the enemy and patch ourselves up as we get shot. Eventually, it's just us two, there's still gunfire, but it's died down a little. He turns to me 'So, what do you think we should do?', I reply 'I think we should just make a run for it'.   And so we do.   He has more stamina than me, considering I'm carrying about 40 rolls of bandages, 80 syringes and several litres of blood, so I naturally fall behind. I try to run full on even after running out of stamina, but I get shot in the head and my character hits the deck. Luckily, the wound isn't fatal so I take some cover and quickly patch myself up and inject some morphine into me. (At this point I think I'm basically a high mummy.) I try to keep up with my squad-mate... but I take more gunfire which causes me to take cover... and when I do, I hear mortar fire.  A mortar hits the ground right in front of me...   And I live. My Torso is badly damaged but I live, so I start bandaging myself and giving myself morphine... but then I hear another mortar...  And I still live. And then another... Still alive. And then another... Still alive. And then I die.  I respawn back at our forward base... my team mate manages to make it back without dying. He is the only survivor.  2) This a story from some random KoTH server. A helicopter pilot does a parachute run over the capture area. I jump out, aiming toward a tower that had friendlies occupying it before, that I still assumed had friendlies inside. I manoeuvre myself as I drop, and I'm about to miss the tower but I manage to pull it in and just land on the edge where a man was standing... 'Crawford killed xxxx' ... oh, that was an enemy... and I... crushed him? I look over to the other guy on the tower... he's patching himself up with a bandage... and I shoot him. I rank up, and some music plays.   I replay in my head the events that have just occurred. -I parachuted onto a tower -Drop kicked the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of a guy as I land -Kill his friend -Awesome music played  â¥â¥â¥â¥ yeah.

3562	1	a	 Arma 3 has been on my list of games to get for a long time, my only disappointment is that I waited so long to get it. This is one of the best games I have played in 2015. I canât wait for some campaign based DLC.
2871	1	a	very good and fun game! highly rercommend

3180	1	a	It's ok.
2626	1	a	Very Good and Fun Game
4466	1	a	I loved (still love) Arma 2: CO and Arma 3 is a brilliant successor. They've added a lot of polish to the game, made movement feel much smoother, and really improved the graphics. With Steam Workshop, new content for the game is just a click away and there are some excellent user-made missions out there. Moreover, there are a ton of mods available which can change various aspects of the game. I've put more than 400 hours into Arma 3 playing and creating missions and that's just in single-player. I can't recommend the game enough to anyone who likes realistic, open-world shooters. It'll be installed on my PC for a long, long time.
1291	1	a	Sometimes me and my friend would make little prison camps for civies and crash jets into it to slowly kill them off. I know we are tAIRable people.  Oh yeah and the games good too.
1533	1	a	Jumped in a 3 foot gap, broke my leg and died instantly.  IGN: 11/10
536	1	a	My oh my this game is incredible.  Bohemia, give yourself a pat on the back. The upgrade from Arma 2 to Arma 3 is astonishing. The graphics! The gameplay! The multiplayer!  STEAM WORKSHOP COMPATABILITY!  Love this game, very replayable due to the aforementioned caps locked sentence above.  Thoroughly enjoy this title and I do recommend for any fan of the Arma series.  No noobs though. I'm aiming at you Call of Duty fanboys! ;)  9/10.  Cons: From Arma 2 to Arma 3 I would of liked to have seen better and more user friendly weapon switching.. Yes I know it's realistic but it does get irritating :)
2955	1	a	Battle royal Get a pistol a backpack an vest shoot a afk guy shoot a camper shoot another afk guy find a SMG in the biggest building killing spree! last 2 people sit in a corner until he moves near you 11/9
4710	0	a	hint 'BIS sucks donkey balls';
655	1	a	Great game, I like the King of the Hill mode, they seem to be improving it really well. just a lot of buttons, and the steam workshop is a nice touch.  Only downside is this games horriable engine. The engine its self is from 2001 and its been pushed beyond what it can really handle on the clients side. Once you start to add about 20 AI or players the engine starts to use the CPU or Video card less and less cuasing a performance drop. I seen maybe 30% CPU/GPU usage on a 106 player King of the hill match with 30 - 35fps hile on armory I can pull well into the 80's with a few players.  Thats my only gripe about this game. If they would fix that then I would have no complaints at all.
434	1	a	'GET THE F*** OFF SIDE CHAT'
294	0	a	WIth the latest awful patch, it is usually impossible to connect in hosted MP. 1/3 of missions that we actually get playing soon drop to 1 FPS, requiring a restart. The devs ignore these issues.  Other issues:    Spyware!   Endless bugs   New bugs every patch   Terrible performance   The developers don't care about the game   Constantly drops to 1 FPS (devs refuse to address this)   Latest patch randomly kicks/prevents joining servers (devs refuse to address this)   Broken AI   Broken features   100% reliant on 3rd party mods for bugfixes, playability and content   Arma 2 offers more for less  I have over 2000 hours in Arma 3 alone, more in the other entries in the series. I have been modding and making missions since the early 2000s. I am the guy who introduced dynamic missions and campaigns to the series. That said, Arma 3 is not worth your money.  Arma 3 is basically a patch of OFP, a game that came out in 2001. The graphics are better, there are new scripting commands and the inventory system is better, but those are the only real improvements. In recent patches BIS finally implemented weapon resting (something modders had in Arma 2 years ago), but it is clumsy and poorly-implemented. The modded solutions are vastly superior.  Every patch for Arma 3 is a disaster. What is broken this time? What features have stopped working? What mods are broken now? Will my performance get worse again?  The latest patch has broken MP. My coop group can not join missions now, despite our modset being identical. Sometimes after trying to join over and over it will let players in. Then when we restart the mission it won't let people join. Last time we played it took over an hour of disabling mods and endless retries before we could play a single mission. It seems the devs are cracking down on mods.  Even the bugs are broken. Often bugs happen randomly and in a non-reproducable way. Sometimes the AI driver won't follow movement orders, sometimes he will. There is no pattern.  A big problem is that control of your AI squadmates is much worse than previous games. In OFP your could use tactical view to position your guys, tell them to hold fire and they would do it. This made it possible to set up ambushes. In Arma 3 this is impossible. Your AI will often not move to where you click on the map. A very common occurence is to order your squad to a position 100 meters behind you and they will instead move 100 meters in front.  Friendly AI struggle to engage enemy targets. Countless times I have seen my troops blankly staring down their sights at an enemy for several seconds, finally getting shot instead. In contrast, the enemy can still do a first-shot head-shot over iron sights from 200 meters away, something people complained about in 2001.  AI squadmates are little more than extra lives in coop. At least the needless respawn delay has finally been removed.  Another bug is when your squad takes fire, they will enter combat mode and you can't get them out of it. They become unresponsive to commands and are out of your control. This makes it impossible to break contact or dash to a new position. In other words, when you take fire, you lose control of your squad. This can be fixed with mods, but not in vanilla. Again, modders save the day because the devs don't care.  If you are a group commander in a vehicle but switch to gunner and then exit the vehicle, the vehicle driver will run over you. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. It is things like this that make me think the devs never even play their game.  That said, enemy AI is improved over OFP. However, the AI still requires mods do basic things like enter buildings, take cover, call for support, crew weapons etc.  AI are even less capable of driving than previous games. I made a mission where the enemy starts in a village and spreads out from there, seizing the map town by town. However, I noticed that a few minutes after spawning, the enemy technical groups slowed down greatly. When I used a camera view to debug, I saw that most of the AI had crashed their vehicles so badly (whilst safe and driving down empty roads), that they had wrecked the vehicles in their group and were now on foot.  Let that sink in. The AI can not drive down roads for a few kilometers without wrecking their vehicles, even when not in combat.  The implementation of PhysX is terrible and often slows the game to a crawl or crashes it. About one in three coop games requires a restart because a vehicle gets stuck on a building and the FPS hits 4. You will also see hilarious glitches like tanks suddenly flying into the air for no reason.  The worst thing about Arma 3 is that the developers just don't care. They ignore major bugs, but then implement rubbish that nobody wants. So now there is Workshop integration (who cares?), but you still can't control your troops in combat.  Despite existing in earlier games, there are no females in Arma 3. So what do the devs give us? Go karts! It is absurd.  The action menu was terrible when OFP was released in 2001, and Bohemia has made no efforts to improve it. For those not familiar with it, you have to use the middle mouse button to control essential actions. Say you want to climb a ladder, you might accidentally set off your satchel charges instead. Or a single mis-click and you turn off your helicopter's engine. There are several mods which show how this could be done better, but again, the devs don't care.  A great point is the modding community. There are tons of fantastic mods that add units, islands, functions and fix Bohemia's shoddy work.  People will tell you that Arma 3 is some super-realistic military simulation. It has realistic elements, but it also has magic medkits that instantly heal you. The tanks are STILL using a hitpoint system and can be killed with any weapon as long as you hit it enough times. Also, tanks still do stupid things like get into combat, inexplicably expose their rear armor to the enemy and then use their coax to engage an MRAP whilst ignoring some AFV that is shooting them.  The artillery system is a joke. Some of the special round types (eg. guided shells) don't work at all.  The naval aspect is a gimmick with zero value in the game. There are no true naval assets, the aquatic elements serve absolutely no purpose and are useless in game.  In those rare cases when it all comes together, nothing breaks and you are fighting the enemy instead of the game engine, Arma 3 can offer an amazing experience like no other game. But you will need to spend dozens of hours researching and installing mods and learning how to avoid the bugs. Arma 3 is broken and unfinished, you will have to invest a lot of time to make it work for you. Vanilla offers a boring, unpolished, unfinished experience. Every patch will require more hours of troubleshooting before you can play smoothly again.  If you really want to see what Arma has to offer, just get Arma 2 and its addons. It is much cheaper, has about 500% of the content of Arma 3, is more stable and has far more mods. In fact one of the major modding projects for Arma 3 is to import Arma 2 content. Arma 2 has far more islands and factions. You will not have to deal with all of the bugs Arma 3 introduces.  Some fanboys will attack this review. But I have been contributing to OFP/Arma community for over a decade. I am sick of waiting for Bohemia to take their game seriously and fix the bugs. It seems all they care about now is Life game modes.  I could go on and on. One final bug: the one where you suddenly start flapping your arms and floating in the air like a bird.  Bottom line: Arma 3 is definitely not worth the money. Arma 2 can provide more than Arma 3 at a much lower cost and with less bugs. Even if you get Arma 3 for free, you will have to invest a lot of time and effort into it to make it playable. Even then, sometimes it will simply not let you join a server.
1641	1	a	Really nice game. Never thought a game could be such a nice simulation in anything :D
2544	1	a	10/10 Would play forever

3795	1	a	Great Simulator IF you have Oculus Rift Recomend game Great
1133	1	a	This is a damn good and realistic game. Very good war simulator and graphics are awesomeness when they are at high and when graphics are set to ultra or better they are fantastic! This is one of the best games I have played!
2324	1	a	ive played arma for about a good 3 years now went i first got arma 3 i liked it i was very excited but then  theres something im really annoyed by the game would like randomly crash and send me to my desktop every 1 hour or 30 minutes every tim i still recommend this game but thats the only thing i think would be a huge step to fix
181	1	a	It's difficult to compare Arma to another game since it's so unique. The gameplay is not your typical shooter as it incorporates strategic elements and doesn't play like a traditional FPS. Console gamers will have no issues with this game's controls even as their first shooter on a PC.  Arma has a slight learning curve, it may be a little confusing at first until you learn how things work and learn to take cover. Arma has a lot of little details to gameplay that you can improve upon to give yourself and edge such as the stance adjustment controls. But they aren't vital for successful gameplay. Arma is only as complex as you want it to be. Even though it is a simulation game, it feels much more natural to play than other simulations.  Singleplayer - The story is actually pretty good, some of the scenarios definitely have a challenging OP:Flashpoint feel to it which I'm a fan of. It's divided into 3 episodes with their own chapters, each episode giving a new perspective to the conflict and upping the scales of battle. There's also a Bootcamp mini-campaign which will help new players a lot.  Multiplayer and Community - Arma is a great game to play alone, it's even better together. There's lots of public servers with a variety of gamemodes that you can just jump into. Lots of awesome custom scenarios too such as the Co-Op scenario Invade and Annex, as well as the PvP scenarios such as KoTH and Wasteland. But the best experience is playing with an organized group. There are casual co-op groups, PvP clans as well as hardcore roleplaying 'milsim units'. You can feel around for what's right for you.  Editor - Arma has always had a very powerful Mission Editor tool and has open support for custom scripts. This alone is all we needed to make missions. Then BI gave us Zeus - an in-game editor, look up some videos - this alone will entertain you for hours by yourself. Now BI has also promised a 3D Mission Editor to cover even finer details.  Mods - The game is advertised as a military simulator and it does a great job of that just as-is. But really it's whatever you want it to be and you can deepen the simulation aspects with user content. The community is actively pumping out amazing mods for this game and BI has always been highly supportive of community content (even to the point of cash giveaways from the Make Arma Not War competition). If you can think of something cool to add to Arma, it's probably already got a download link.  Criticism - Although the game engine gets some flak for being 'unoptimized' (BI has been improving on the game's performance significantly) when you think about it, how many game engines have this kind of attention to detail in such a wide scope of gameplay? You can be infantry (even fight underwater with certain assault rifles), skydive/HALO jump, pilot a transport chopper, fly a jet, drive a tank, use artillery, anything. Not to mention the detail of the environment even to the starmap. What other game can you think of tracks the temperature the ground depending on time of day and when last it rained therefore affecting your thermal optics? Yea, thought so.  DLC - Arma 3's DLC is optional, and you can just get modded content which are not affected. Even if you don't buy the DLCs you'll get the improvements to the game and still be able to play with anyone who has/doesn't have DLC. Just wanted to clear up the myths of Arma 3's DLC.  I've been playing since the Alpha/Beta with 1,000+ online hrs and I'm still not bored. Arma 3 and Arma overall as a series has come a long way and has improved tremendously and BI listens and improves from community feedback. Arma games have a long lifespan and there are a lot of people just buying it now. It's been almost 2 years since the Alpha was released, and expect Arma 3 to be active for at least another 3-5 years, probably more. Think about it, why buy a bunch of other games when Arma can be all of them for one price? Definitely the most well-spent money I've ever spent on a game for the enjoyment I've gotten so far and will continue to have. No doubt about it. I'm glad I could support such an awesome studio, keep up the great work BI.
4975	1	a	Arma 3 is a great game with a steep learning curve. If you are willing to put in the time, then you will have a great time playing this game; you will make friends, enemies, memes and everything in between playing on servers. I'd recommend bring an irl friend along for the wild ride that is Arma Epoch/Exile/Overpoch and building a base. Great Game - 5/7
4895	0	a	Graphics are pretty shocking and the tutorial is very simplistic but when you begin the first mission there is little help regarding what to do. As a soldier you're left to your own devices and to complete goals solo. Yet some of the goals aren't clear.  Not sure if it's just my old PC but if you're running windows 7 you may have a rough time as I found myself constantly lagging which heightened my annoyance.   I personally would not recomend this game to anyone and I can 100% guarantee I will not be buying the full version of this game. 
3837	1	a	Very fun game, but very steep learning curve.
5100	0	a	The game seems to be ambandoned from the developers... Has bugs and i cant find a multiplayer season with serious players to play. Also a hell of the lag
4684	1	a	there is not enough keyboards in this world to get every keybind harambe/shot
947	1	a	Buy this awesome simulator, and it doesnt need high powered computer for graphs!
407	1	a	Too much running.  10/10 would run again
2318	1	a	i love this game  well worth the 30 bucks from steam sale  
4189	0	a	This is the worst optimised game I have ever seen in my entire life. Not only does the frame rate stick around 25 and BELOW, but even when I put the graphics on LOW, Windowed 1024 x 768, it stays the same. Around 25 FPS. I have a great gaming rig and I just can not enjoy this game. Sometimes I joined a game and it stuck around 10fps. Don't waste your money
4873	0	a	I would reccommend this game to anyone who wants to play arma life or wasteland however if you want to play for the millitary simulator aspect of the game i wouldnt recommend it you will find the majority of the servers are arma life wastland and epoch ect. there are a few servers and if you want to play for the realism i would recommend invade and annex as you work together as a team to accoplish objectives against the AI. also it is pay to win there is content in the game which you can not use in multiplayer matches such as sniper rifles and helicopters without purchasing the DLC i understand they need to make money however i beleive they should develop the game to make more maps and encourage people to buy the game as there is only two maps in the game (without spending Â£25 on the expansion and getting one map and some extra content) and the terrian is quite simular. also infantry is more obsolete due to most vecheials having thermal vision and being able to spot infantry much easier however if you want to play life ect. i would recommend however from my point of view this game is a waste of money (i have also brought the marksmen DLC at first to invest in the company to hope they might bring out some more maps and more content however my funding has gone towards APEX which i would have to buy for Â£25) remember this is not a rant this is just to help people decide on the purchase on this game.
4581	1	a	this game is great
70	1	a	Children play Call of Duty Boys play Battlefield  Men play ARMA
2834	1	a	Arma 3 is most likely to be my most favorite game ever. I have put over 2000 hours into the game so I know a lot about it. It is indeed very buggy but its super fun. There are tons of things to do inside of Arma 3  I spend most of my time playing Battle Royale. I would really recommend this game for people that like Army sims.
2782	1	a	1. Too much Altis Life 2. I hate Altis Life (My option dont try changing it) 3. Everything beside Altis Life is fun 4. Altis Life as Server name takes around 400+ servers 5. There are 4000 servers in total
5377	1	a	one of the Quad A games out there ( AAAA ) :D Best game ever in my opinion   i r8 8/8 m8 w8 88/8 m80
4976	1	a	Great game if you have the patience to play it, but has quite a few bugs/glitches.
4123	1	a	Its okay i guess
2759	1	a	Great game for those interested iin tactics and strategy and not run and gunning!
1734	1	a	The problem with this game is that it's not in your library yet
2450	1	a	For all ppl who love military this is (for me) the best game you can find. Using tactics and strategy to win. I really enjoy the Tactical Realism Servers you need time for this but its just a great game. You almost think your in the fight ;) Oculus Rift and i think you have amazing fun and maybe some scary moments too :D  Sorry for long review and Greetz from germany :)
2391	1	a	really good game. If you liked ArmA 2... You Will Like ArmA 3 Better!
3393	1	a	I've been part of the ARMA franchise since Operation Flashpoint. This is by far the best MilSim to ever be released. If you're into slow, simulated and realistic gameplay... This game is the one for you.
4711	1	a	10 -10 Full paced action packed real good graphics military simulation deffinatly would recommed for people to play  :)
1320	1	a	cool game
1524	1	a	good game but not for bad pcs good for gaming pcs it runs fast for me i recommend this game
102	1	a	This is one of the only games where I can be playing at sub 25 FPS and still have fun.
1074	1	a	best game if your in to realistic action game
5334	1	a	People's necks start glitching out in the back of helicopters. 10/10 would see a doctor again.
2288	1	a	The game is still buggy but it doesn't stop the fun to be had here. If you are a fan of DayZ then you will love the Wasteland mod that is very popular in the Arma series. Arma 3 does have a campaign mode but that is only the beginning. Modders have made this one of the most infinitely replayable games on steam. There are hundreds of downloadable missions to play and a community that is willing to teach you how to play them.  I cant recommend this game enough. If you like games like Red Orchestra and SOCOM then this is the game for you. It might be 60 bucks but, in my opinion, it is worth it. I have put over 100 hours in this game and feel like I have barely scratched the surface.  TLDR: Just buy it.
1622	1	a	Love the game!!
445	1	a	Arma 3 is an incredulous display of what THE REAL VIRTUALITYâ¢ 4 Engine is capable of Graphically, and in sheer Scale. There have been massive improvements to the game The sound engine, animations, and even tree generation have been revamped. Also who could forget The implement of PHYSXâ¢ and DIRECTX 11. Yes the netcode is still being worked on. Yes there are bugs in the gameplay.  'Arma' is always going to be 'Arma,' most of the 'problems' we experienced in Arma 2 are almost completely gone or un-noticeable in Arma 3. Bohemia Interactive is heading in an outstanding direction with the Arma series, Let's keep it that way.
2631	1	a	Arma III takes a very realistic approach to military shooters, which leads to having the player formulate advanced tactics and communicate with his allies to execute said tactics. Shooting mechanics feel great and different from what players are used to. Player movement is rigid and limited, just like a person's would be, although these restrictions can be annoying at times. The way Bohemia Interactive managed DLC for this game is also absolutely amazing, since their strategy doesn't divide the player-base and still earns them profit. The only downside I find is how unpolished it feels. There are numerous visual glitches, the game runs like crap on most devices and the animations are a bit hard to look at. It's overall a fantastic game/simulator, but it desperately needs more visual polish. 9/10
5348	0	a	so meny bugs around.â¥â¥â¥â¥ that game.
196	1	a	Watching friends fly helicopters for the first time. 10/10.
4851	1	a	Before i start this i want to say this a great game. best game i have but.. They are asking for money all these DLC's. This game is't cheap, and they are asking for all these 3 dlc's thats out, and APEX will cost too?! Anyways it's a good game.
4278	1	a	10/10
3827	1	a	ive heard great things about this game too bad i cant afford the â¥â¥â¥â¥ :(
2269	1	a	Arma 3 is the bbbeeesssttttt!!!!!!!!!
346	1	a	One of the best FPS/TPS games i've ever played. If u like tactics, simulation and hardcore - try ArmA III
3112	1	a	Has its bugs here and there but the fact its crafted for modular addition gameplay is what i love about it.
4299	1	a	This game is awesome!!!
2380	1	a	Look at the hours i've played, a awesome step up from arma 2 with better graphics and a more intutive interface with more advance servers. Overall a great game to buy if you like military simulations or simulations in general.
653	1	a	If you liked ARMA 2, then you will enjoiy this as well. I have this solely for Epoch Mod and it is just fantastic. The visuals are stunning, the maps are large and the game play is smooth. I definitley recommend this to anyone who likes large maps with seemingly endless possibilities!
1720	1	a	Its a fantastic game but be warned unless your into heavy roleplay their isent to much here besides the lackluster campaign and standard shooter game modes but if you have a nice rig and want to roleplay i suggest joining a milsim unit or a life community.
2505	1	a	After 650+ Hrs of gameplay I can thouroughly say that this is one of the best games I have ever played. The DLC for Helicopters is a little overpriced, there are some bugs that still persist occasionally but they are paled in compairison to the fantastic gameplay, realism, and fantastic community. When I say fantastic community I do mean it but be aware of the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ who like to hang out on the wasteland and RP servers. Other than that, it's an A++ game and I highly recommend it to all.
1936	1	a	I love this game to put it simply. 10/10 Can do almost anything in this game, well worth the money in my opinion!
1255	1	a	Tried to pet a goat and died. 10/10
1349	1	a	Playing this game like it's my job. Really fun, I would pay full price any day of the week.
4498	1	a	this game is amazing it offers hundreds of joices so you can never get bored. this is a definite ten out of ten
4502	1	a	Closest you can get to a real life war simulator. 10/10
3890	1	a	So after about a year of off and on playing, I thought id give it a review. One word. AMAZING. I dont understand how this game is so fun. Almost all of the (close to) 600 hours I have played on this has been in A3Armorys Stratis Server. I can play it for hours upon hours and not get too bored. Yes after 600 hours of stock arma the weapons, vehicles, gear does get really stale. And that brings me too mods. Mods make this game 10000x better. It brings new content into this game. So much new content that I dont think anyone will ever get bored. You have Life mods. You have Gun Game. You have Dayz. Theres so much replayability in this game. Theres so much to do. So much you can create. Its almost endless. With the addition of Apex this month we will have plenty of new guns, vehicles, gear to choose from when playing. This game is just simply awesome. It does have its downfalls. The lack of official content gets stale after alot of playtime. The optimization really sucks.(I get about 20-30 fps in wasteland stratis with full server) But I have so much fun its hard not to recomend it. You also have those really funny arma physics. So 11/10
1393	1	a	Let's get something straight right away: I HATE shooters. I've always been the type of guy who likes RPGs and fantasy/sci-fi games. For me, shooters are just too, how to say this, similar for me. Sure, when you first play a shooter you feel engaged in this world where the battlefield comes to life and every action could have an equal and opposite (i.e. death) reaction: it's really fun. But, as I played more and more shooters, they all started to blend together: play the campaign that involves either terrorists in the Middle-East, Russia vs. America, or a black op gone rouge, and once you're completely bored with that, spend hours on end in the multiplayer. There wasn't that exploration, decisions (in regard to gear and strategy), or overall autonomy that many RPGs offered.   Then, I found Arma II. This was one shooter that I absolutely loved, and I easily poured hours into it. The fact you could tackle any mission with any strategy (even going in with no combat appearel), find a server devoted to almost anything (i.e. DayZ, Chenarus Life), and the variety of missions all entranced me, but the main seller for me was the content creator. Never before in ANY game had I been able to create what I wanted to at a moment's notice. Found a mission in the campaign to be unsatisfactory? Just create your own better rendition of it, or even your own original idea from scratch. I had spent days in-game, and when Arma III was announced, you can bet that it was an instant seller for me. When I got it for $60, I was awed by the improved graphics, more introducable interface in the creator, and Workshop content that was amazing.   For the first time in a while, I felt as the battlefield had come alive, and every choice I made had dire consequences. It was like I had played a shooter for the first time, which is a magical feeling. Sure, the campaign may be run-of-the-mill, but you can always make your own mission or even campaign. I do have complaints about some of the physics and glitches, but (1. It does its job, and (2. The game has to load a minumun of 17+ spuare kilometres. In comparison, Grand Theft Auto V had a world size of about 32 miles at most. Arma III's biggest map is 270 km for Pete's sake! I'd be suprised if the game only had twenty known glitches.   All in all, Arma III is worth more than what you pay for it, and is definitely head-and-shoulders above Call of Duty and Battlefield. I saw a picture on the internet that sums up my feelings: 'Command a soldier (image of COD), Command a squad (image of BFF), or command an army or squad or soldier (image of Arma III)'. Too whoever posted that picture: I deeply concur with you!
5413	1	a	Have passed 480+ hours on this steam account and still enjoy it! You should check out the modding community, love all the mods including Altis Life, Exile, Epoch and Arma 3 Project Life. You should atleast give the community a try, since its the community what makes this game so great!
4093	1	a	got global banned within 10 minutes of playing. gg
3023	1	a	Great and possibly the most realistic war-game. With its modding capabilities it offers so much more than just a simple FPS. Highly recommended.
701	1	a	its just that good.
56	1	a	Can't tell you if you should buy it or not, but I can tell you this. You will find annoying bugs, highly requested features that isn't there and lack of content if you're not satisfied with what you have.  But when you really get down to it, and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission, it's something magical you just can't find in any other game.  Arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away. You buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly. Arma is a game which you can never called finished. There will always be added to it, be it user or official content, fixes, features or optimizations.   Hope I expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it :)  If you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare, this will be your gem!  I'll give it a 9/10, simply because: screw bugs, I've used hundreds of hours on Arma 3 that I would never take back.   READ: I will not accept random friend requests! If you have a question, please post it in the comments.
4008	1	a	I found this game 'fun, entertaining and breath taking' action packed
345	1	a	I've had this game for quite a long time but never really found what to do with it.,..until I found Altis Life! WOW! It's so much fun roleplaying as a civ trying to find his way on Altis Island. If you like roleplaying and are open to all sorts of avenues that appear in front of you, then this is definitely the game for you! Top Drawer!!
4214	0	a	The best 30 FPS simulator I have ever played. Game is so good that user mods are better than the actual game. My personal favorite part about this game is the desync where you see people in tanks flying across the map raining down shells across the map.
4995	1	a	Very good game if you like to rolepay.
3429	1	a	I played RolePlaying and got harassed by a bunch of french guys. It was fun.
4218	0	a	Bad performance it has.. Great graphics, it does. Recommend I do not.
77	1	a	Children play Call of Duty Boys play Battlefield  Men play ARMA
2902	1	a	Really good all round would strongly recommend
2573	1	a	This is probley the best game iv played. Good graphics and realisme!
2281	1	a	It's GREAT! Just, if you don't like those complex controls, then i wouldn't recommend it, but if you can get used to it easily, YOU'RE SET! Overall, Great game
3259	1	a	Better than Arma 2.
4042	1	a	No, this is in no way better than Call of Duty, I feel cheated with this game, it's too hard and endlessly complex.
247	1	a	You can fight war without clothes on; Explosions everywhere; Destroy pretty much any vehicle with fences; Desync. galore!  What's not to love about this game! 
3008	1	a	A brilliant game, well worth all the hundreds of hours I have poured into it, it is by no means a finished product however, there are many more improvements and features to come, but for what you get, it's well worth it!
3777	1	a	est game ever I recomend geting while its on sale :D
493	1	a	one of the best games played!
2430	1	a	My first game on A3 brought me the most horrific experience I've ever had in any game, ever.  We're on our way to the objective, a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces. I'm leading a team of 4 men. We come to a crossroad and I sprint across, telling my men to hold back. I cross a few more times, trying to get a response from any snipers. Nothing.  I run, my SAW gunner runs, my medic runs. But I kept my Marksman on the other side to make sure we'd make it across.  Anybody seen Full Metal Jacket all the way through? Remember the sniper scene?  The marksman takes a round in the leg as we're running and goes down. He then takes two more in the chest. The kid who was playing had some mad acting skills, he played it up to 11 here. He screams as he's being shot. Crawling, drenched in his own blood. 'SARGE? YOU AIN'T LEAVING ME OUT HERE LIKE THIS, RIGHT? I-I WANNA GO WITH YOU GUYS! C'MON SARGE, H-HELP ME! C'MON! PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME!' he died after that. I cried and he respawned.  I would recommend getting :)
765	1	a	since the mod-community is starting to warm up on this game, i recommend it to every MIL-SIM gamer/lover!
3040	1	a	it is so nuch fun and flying in a heli is awesome the plans are even better the guns are awesome all i have to do is hold down the trigger
3967	1	a	After the steep learning curve it's really good fun. Beware, it seems very graphics intensive.
572	1	a	Game had great introduction and I had fun. But I don't know what it says about war game when the most fun part was the driving parts... There was also lot of lag and frame rate kept jumping. I also had problems with achievements so that they did not come up when I got them but late or not at all. Game had problems but I still recommend it because it was fun and had good story.
1905	1	a	worth your money, if you have some friends to play with you will spend alot of time playing.
774	1	a	One of the best mil-sim ever produced. It offers a great variety of units, vehicles, weapons and environmental diversity. The best part, still the modding community and the Arma III Editor, literally endless. You can create at will, modify, script it, doesn't matter, if you want, YOU CAN DO IT. Ballistics and Physics have improved astonishingly, the animations are fluid and you can feel it's verisimilitude. If you're a seasoned ArmA veteran, you'll definitely love this game, you'll find everything you already know and a whole new scale of possibilities and AWESOMENESS. If you're new to the ArmA Series, you, like everyone else, will go through a very steep learning curve, you'll find yourself having troubles running, walking, aiming, shooting, driving, flying, planning and pretty much any activity you're about to perform. but don't give up just yet, I can assure you, if you're a fan of mil-sim, you'll love it and it'll come to life. The game is pretty much awesome, but it'll really come to life once you find a couple of friends to play with! Good Luck! See you in Altis!
1770	1	a	You guys should definitely try this game out if you into doing everything in war games! I mean come on?! Dive to the beach and jump out of water kill an all enemy squad and dive back to your ship in MP!!! and you dont even need mods COME ON!  Be a sniper for 1500 meters shoot and hit.....  Or you can use mods and its going to be the best game ever!   BUY IT NOW AND STOP BEING IN THE SUN FOR A LIFE TIME :D
1168	1	a	I can highly reccomend this game if you are into any sort of simulators, or realistic combat. I have had extreme amounts of fun with all of the user created missions, with or without friends.   I reccomend once you have purchased this game to follow these steps to have an early look at the Zeus free DLC as it can add a whole extra level of enjoyment with the mission ever changing due to your actions, in the state of mind of the Dungeons and Dragons Role Playing Board Game. This is ow you can have early access to the DLC: &gt;Purchase and download ARMA 3 &gt;Right Click 'ARMA 3' in your steam library &gt;Click 'Properties' &gt;Up the top, you will see a 'Betas' Tab, click it &gt;The click the dropdown arrow next to 'Opt out of all betas' and change it so you are opted into the betas &gt;Click ok and return to your library, you should see an update for ARMA 3, around 1GB &gt;If not, launch hte game, the update should now start &gt;Once the update has finished, launch ARMA 3 &gt;From the main menu play multiplayer &gt;From the server browser, find any server that is marked with a [DEV] tag, this will be running the Zeus DLC &gt;Play around on a couple servers, find which one takes your fancy &gt;Enjoy!  That should be all I need to say, oh, have i told you to buy this game yet? Jus jus just.... do it. Take a leap of faith.
3222	1	a	3 little words . best game ever 
3390	1	a	Realistic. And sometimes not realistic, but its a simulator so what'd you expect. Go kill a bunch of people and make a ton of money racking up your war crimes only to realize hours later none of it was real. Kinda like playing a game all day huh?
113	1	a	Community ruined due to famous YouTubers who play battlefield and call of duty spreading the amazingment about this game  Still my favorite game after the salty 10 year olds took over and became admins on all the servers  13/37 
4587	1	a	Good game. I probably spend too much time playing it, but there is just so much to do.
3670	1	a	One of the best games i've ever played
4897	1	a	This is defenently a work in proggress but with a leap in animations from Arma 2 but still requires jets, planes and more variety of cars and classes with an ability to customize your firearm
5222	0	a	16gb of RAM 1tb HDD gtx 970 msi  amd 8350 processor  playing this game is impossible. can't get more than 15fps online. STUPID
1112	1	a	It's OK, I guess.
4029	1	a	this is the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥iest game i have ever played if you are thinking about getting it dont because otherwise you are an fajit so you can suck my an â¥â¥â¥â¥ bruh and its not freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee betch
4333	1	a	bug free
5393	1	a	+1
4084	1	a	This is THE game to own. There's nothing else like it and the Community is great ! 10/10 from me easy
1237	1	a	My car blew up when i honked at someone. 10/10
413	1	a	Omg this was definitely one of the best military games I've ever played. Whether you're doing campaign or Online this game is awesome to the max. Loved the trial will be buying soon (Steam summer sale will begin shortly so don't let the 66$ price tag scare you away) :D
300	0	a	Before you decide to downvote this review because its a negative recommendation, Please read. There are positive things about this game if you take your time to read this and/or the comments Ive posted below.  Bohemia have gone down hill, even if their game has enhanced somewhat, its not worth anywhere near the price they sell it at and the fact that you have to pay for small updates they call DLC's is disgusting, I completley regret buying this game, we've payed a bunch of greedy frauds.  The modding community could do better and their downloads are free. This is both disrespectfull to the average player and the modding community. Its like a 'Go â¥â¥â¥â¥ yourself' outlook on the whole consumer market of ARMA titles.  Whilst I used to be a follower of ARMA titles, I refuse to accept the fact that bohemia are too ignorant to pay some kind of respect to the community, its beginging to look like a move EA would pull. -Youve brought our game for a overly-expensive amount of money and now that we release content that should have been present in the ALPHA version is now being released late so we can rip you off even more then we did before.  This has completley ruined the positive vibes that I once had for Bohemia. Disgracefull.
3002	1	a	Whould cheeki for breeki again 10/10
2686	1	a	This game is really what you make of it (the mods you play, the people you play with). The groundwork has been layed, the maps, the models, the netcode (...still pretty bad lol). You have to find the gamemode that you can get into and only then you really understand what arma offers. The entertainment from this game is a rollercoaster, no scenario you encounter is ever the same.  And no, buying a $4000 computer will not improve your fps in multiplayer...
5181	0	a	I have only played this on the Sp campaign so far so my thoughta are based on this as a solo experience. This is a flipping JANKY (holy mother it is sooo janky) game, first of all. i have seen more bugs than a red roof inn, it seriously kindof playes like an early access release. The AI is soooo bad. which wouldnt be that big of a deal except you have to constantly micro manage a group of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ through an active war zone of aim botted one shot kills. This is made somewhat better through mods but not really. i can say for certain that the SINGLE PLAYER CAMPAIGN is NOT a military sim in any sense. It is a bad COD level story supplemented by an amazingly obtuse control scheme, that makes this feel more like a typing simulater than any kind of military game.(Honestly i know people are going to crucify me for this, but MGSV, in all its rediculous story glory, is about 1000x a more competant 'sim' than this) It is probably better in Multiplayer when you dont have to deal with the shokingly bad AI, but it basically puts you through a bunch of bad story beats on par with the worst military action game, but with flight sim controls. I am very VERY suprised at my reaction to this game so far. im hoping the excellent MOD community and hopefully good multiplayer community will change my opinion moving foreword. i want a good milsim that encourages smart tactics and careful, controlled action. I hope i find that game in here soon.
789	1	a	Got forced intto singing Wrecking Ball and be put on youtube for not paying a fine ingame.   10/10 would sing again  Proof:  http://www.altislife.co.uk/topic/45988-unable-to-pay-fine/   
3485	1	a	Great game. played it while it was free. enjoyed it. now i want it
2538	1	a	Without A doubt my favorite computer game to play as of now.  TLDR: If you are under the age of 16, Don't buy this game, You will not have the paitence for it and most likely get extremely â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off that you won't be able to hit an enemy from 15 yards away.  The Multiplayer has SO, SO many games modes, my favorite being Alits life, and the way you can mod all types of different vehicles into alits life.   Like all other games ARMA has it's problems, but they are too small for me to really explain to any potential buyers. This game is a MUST HAVE without a doubt.
5273	1	a	pretty gay.
4154	0	a	Great idea, good controls etc...........but the bugs are horrific. Almost 2 years on and you can still die from clipping through walls, missions can't be completed, or the AI breaks is just not acceptable.
469	1	a	Great game!
2758	1	a	  Was given this game as a gift from a friend and would say that I would pay for it if I had not gotten it as a gift. The game is worth retail to anyone who enjoys playing First Person Shooters as well as strategy as you will get nowhere with just trying to point and shoot. Physics and Bullet dynamics are all very realistic and can be affected by many things. This game is on the top of my list. 5/5
1871	1	a	ok so i have been playing for about 5 hours now. ive died about 100 times ive got about 3 kills. i havent a clue what im doing or how to do it.....   BUT DAM ITS GOOD something about it just makes you wanna play more and more
3416	1	a	Server waiting simulator 2020
2145	1	a	This is a great war simulator which suports realisim with real time 1st or 3rd person stratagy. go it alone our with a squad of AI's or players and i general great game
768	1	a	Realistic Battlefield Simulation!
3307	1	a	Super sereal kill bots simulator.
5139	0	a	its not what i thought 
3911	1	a	YOU CAN â¥â¥â¥â¥IN SALUTE PEOPLE LIKE WHAT HEY GET THIS GAME NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWW
3450	1	a	This is a great gam if you're interested in military simulators. I've found quite a few Veterens playing this. It does take a pretty beefy computer, but hey, if you can manage 60 FPS in a 200 kmÂ² map, it's quite beautiful. For true realism, I recommend the ACE3 mod, but if you're okay with that, explore mods,   9/10 in my view
4951	0	a	Even someone with a tricked out PC can't play this smoothly. Otherwise it would be awesome.
5251	1	a	Best Military game so far!
2263	1	a	Arma 3..so far this is the best game of the Arma series, I thoroughly enjoyed playing Arma 2 and all it had to offer and Arma 3 continued that for me, the game is much smoother and alot easier to play yet still keeping that challenging aspect it originally had, the modding community for this game is amazing and some of the stuff I have seen made and played makes the game itself better than what it already was, for anyone skeptical of moving from Arma 2 to this, don't be, It's worth the buy.
1249	1	a	tl;dr Game is slower paced but very good.  This game is the pinnacle of the military FPS subgenre. It literally does not get any better than this when it comes to realistic shooters. Do not go into the game expecting fast paced shooting like in most modern shooters. Expect to use tactics and work with your team to overcome enormous obstacles.  This is not for people who need to shoot something every 5 seconds. Most of the meat of the gameplay is in coordinating with your squadmates, completing objectives, and getting shots in from sometimes thousands of yards away. Every kill is a small victory in this game; getting 8 kills during a multiplayer coop mission is something to be proud of, depending on the mission. The satifsfaction from eliminating enemies in this game is not one of 'I got a lot of kills' but 'I helped my squad complete an objective.'  Personally I didn't like ARMA 2 because of how clunky it felt with both it's inventory management and control, but that's completely remedied in ARMA 3. Movement feels responsive and the inventory is streamlined and easy to understand.  The developers are adding new features to this game for free constantly and workshop support + numerous mods ranging from full conversions to minor gameplay improvements ensure that there is no end to the amount of content you can download for this game. On top of that, at least from the people I've played with the community is stellar, the fact that this is a 'Hardcore' shooter means that most of the kiddies who come from 'That game franchise' get bored and leave immediately leaving only the dedicated whom are willing to learn and utilize the unique gameplay mechanics. This has to be the first game where the times I've actually run into 12 year olds, they were just as helpful, attentive, and cooperative as the average good player.   Expect to walk for long periods of time before engaging in any actual firefight and expect to train yourself in single player before joining an online game. I had to play  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=192094335&amp;searchtext=Helicopter+Training  for a good four hours before I was comfortable with flying a heli let alone going into enemy lines with one; Even after I'm still a bit rusty. But I'll get better. Same with learning how to operate a sniper rifle, which actually involves adjusting distance for your bullets to go where you want them to. A mission I play often to train in sniping is  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=227323006&amp;searchtext=Blue+viper    My gripes with the game extend to at times awful friendly/enemy AI, really. Another thing is that this game could have benefitted from a demo or benchmark as the optimization is different than ARMA 2's and many I know are unsure if this game will run right on their lower end PCs. The game could also do with an official mod manager that streamlines server mod downloads; it's easy to download missions but not mods. You'll be able to play on only very few servers since most run some mod like ACRE or a mod that one might have to go on a wild google chase to find.  Edit: Workshop Support has been added for mods instead of just campaigns.  One technical aspect I REALLY appreciate is the fact that you don't have to manually forward any ports to host a server. Holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ only few have any idea how much of a pain in the â¥â¥â¥ that is. I'm glad that ARMA just lets you host a server for your buddies, hassle free. Thank you, bohemia.  Edit: Since gamespy went down this is no longer the case and you need hamachi. â¥â¥â¥â¥.  All in all, I recommend this game highly, even at $60, which I will almost never do. But this game is so fully featured and refreshing that I find it hard to tell you to wait for a sale. But again, I cannot stress enough that this game is for the team player and the highly attentive. It is not for run and gunners or lone wolves. Movement is more likely to get you killed than save you most of the time. I've only put in 25 or so hours so far but I see myself playing this game for a total of hundreds in the future.
224	1	a	Arma 3 is awesome, even the fact this game isnt so intense like all these these cods and battlefields. At this point we don't have to wait for more tanks and jets, you can get them from armaholic! The movements of the characters are just more than good. Fortunately BIS said goodbye to Arma 2 physics and introduced more realistic engine. I would recommend this game for all who want to feel more reality than in battlefield or call of duty series. Everything you need its â¥â¥â¥â¥ing beast computer.
4403	1	a	&gt;Plays offline 3 hours. &gt;Decides it's enough. Goes multiplayer. &gt;Buys a car &gt;Teleported by a hacker in a strange place. &gt;Gets a parachute from a guy.  &gt;The parachute was actually stolen. &gt;Gets shooted by the guy. Best game. 10/10 would stole parachute again.
3478	1	a	Arma is love, Arma is life. No better simulation on the market. Taking down 5-10 in a single engagement can feel more rewarding than an entire playthrough of any other military game. CoDF*gs need not apply. As the saying goes: Wussies play CoD, boys play Battlefield, ARMA is for men ;)
1141	1	a	This game is the only game I could replay for years. AI is very limited, still improved in the past updates. I think if Bohemia create another AI that fits their game, well probably the best war game ever made.
1669	1	a	awesom , the most realistic game I ever seen
2405	1	a	Awesome game 10/10 very fun, exciting and fast paced.
4631	1	a	Military nerds! Buy this game for all the military porn you can play with.
3514	1	a	arma3 is a good war game simulator i have been playing this alot and i recommend to buy it if you like war game simulators.
2304	1	a	Hide while snipers endlessly shoot at you with there guns that sound like clickers
3163	1	a	I like the realism that his game has.
675	1	a	I only have 2 arms wtf
2144	1	a	So lets get this â¥â¥â¥â¥ started, i met a prick called scotttt (jk luv im relly &lt;3), i was playing altis life RP when all of a sudden i come across a new spawn and pick him up on the back of my quad bike. We proceed to drive around the main city doing mad sick tricks fam, then my friends suggest we kidnap him so naturally i went along with this. We tie him up, phisically abuse him and steal his kidneys (i ate them ;)) Once we had taken said kidneys he turned around and asked for a lift we said yes took him to the hospital and got him healed up. Somehow he decided to ask to join our gang,we said yes and now we are friends (somehow)   Great game   10/10  Would recomend to a friend                                                                   ;)
2076	1	a	  Takes Some Time To UnderStand How To Play But When You Get It Its The Greatest Game Out There
728	1	a	-Second time writing review!- Best Military Shooter game i'v ever played! Pros -Realistic physics -Beautifull graphics -Good Optimization (after 1.60 update)  Cons -Playing in servers,fps drops  ---Wasteland--- So here i am with my cousin,next to city named ''Kavala''. We started to run towards the city to get some better gear,and hope to not see anybody. When we we're in city,we heard tank coming towards us,so we ran away and got lost,i didn't know where my cousin was,but one thin i knew,that he was somewhere in the city. I found an MK rifle and found RPG rocket,but not an actual RPG,so i didn't take it. Then i heard gun shots,so i started to run where sound led me,thinking that its maybe my cousin,when i was close to gun shots,i started to hear Tank engine sound,so i crouched and aprouched area. Saw tank was shooting at house with machine gun,so i aimed at guy who was shooting,and shot him in head. Tank wasn't moving so i realized thats an AI,so i aprouched tank from behind and set three mines that i found and ran away,then started to shoot at tank so it drives backwards to my location,and it did. Tank exploded but i didn't know,what they we're shooting at,i cerafully went in that house and saw my cousin.  --Exile--  So i spawned,and got killed by zombie horde.  -------------------------------- Sorry for my english! :P  well.....yeeeahhh.....buy it.. actually...eh
1035	1	a	when i played this game for free and it was only for two days .My bro and me could not stop play arma 3 wasteland is all we played I highly recommend this game if you are in to big maps first preson shooter best game i ever played in years 
3585	1	a	Start playing arma Join invade and annex server play for 15 minues to capture zone Squad dies on defense pushed to edge of cliff under fire Try to jump off into water No jump button Die 10/10 Would fail to recreate lone survivor again 
4869	1	a	This is a superb game! I have played it for years and I highly recommend it!
2291	1	a	Good game and lots of mods so you never get bored   Breaking Point, Waste Land, Altis Life just to name a few!!!! 
5040	1	a	it is worth buying
756	1	a	If I could give this game 5 stars... I wouldn't... But 4.5 without question, this game is a tonne of fun if your looking for something way more realistic than battlefeild! Best served with a squad and a large helping of patience...  Also expect many random deaths due to walls and stuff
3428	1	a	I only really play Over/E Poch, and from my experience its a great game. You have moments when helis blow up for no reason, or you die to stairs but when you look past that, the skys the limit, to building bases, collecting weapons, starting firefights with your neighbours, or making peace treatys. this game is great.
3525	1	a	This was very awesome FPS games! Nice Graphic and there's so many mode on it ....so it's not easy to make you become bored. So fun if u guy's playing together with best friend's or family's. U guy's must have this game!  ^_^V
4143	1	a	Better graphics than real life
4409	1	a	If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.  Ingredients: 1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie   Directions: 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.
2832	1	a	This is the kind of game that PC gamers should be proud of.  There is a hard learning curve when you start with it but the options you get, the possibilities, all the mods, game types, content is worth enough for the sacrifice.  The game is best played with friends, theres plenty of communities out there to joi n, no matter if you are new or a veteran most of them will welcome you.  
4969	1	a	So this one is a weird one. On the one hand this game can be an amazing amount of fun whilst playing several different mods already integrated into the system. It is some of the most tense fun ive had in a strategic FPS. The game also looks pretty dang good,  On the other hand this game screams BETA, with bugs a plenty lack of many features that was avilible in arma 2. For example bi-pod integration still hasnÂ´t been going in. That alongside the DLC being added even though the game is extremely unpolished.   Simply put: arma 3 is great but also a big dissapointment from me. 6.5/10  p.s performance is still a huge problem for many people so make sure you can run it!
690	1	a	Buys game and 5 days later it is 50% Sale. 10/10
466	1	a	Stairs and Heights are your worst enemy
3391	1	a	This game made me an operator,its so tactial 30 minds ride to fire one bullet and die,also made me pop boners on tacticool gear,all in all I give if 9 out of 10 dynamic stories,if only the FPS was operational level i would operate with other operators,
2158	1	a	Shut up and buy this awsome game already
1419	1	a	It's a good game ! ( OverPoch to dayz mod is so awesome ! ) BEST BUY
1592	1	a	Imagine dayz with good frames and cars. Oh wait that is arma 3!
3360	1	a	If it fits, I sit
3622	1	a	About as close as you'll get to being in war without having to leave your home... 5.56/7.62 would recommend
5010	1	a	Buy this game. 20/10
4172	0	a	Runs like â¥â¥â¥â¥. I want to recommend this but this game has been out for long enough and it still doesn't run well.
2254	1	a	Get it and Play it enjoy it. It is alpha and it will have annoying bug or something weird.
405	1	a	You get some freindly people on this unlike Arma 2 never the less brill game!!
3984	1	a	Most realistc and funnist game I have ever played!!!
1499	1	a	its good
229	1	a	Cannot and will not stop playing. Logged over 850 hours and still going strong. The game never had a lot going on for a while but with all the fine tweeking Bohemia have done and are still doing which in turn is allowing some really fantastic mods to either port over form Arma 2 or Ones that are completely new come onto the scene. With all the current DLC and the Marksman DLC on its way plus the winners of Make Arma Not War announced there has never been a better time to get on and get stuck in. Whether its life you're into, base building on Wasteland/Epoch or just blowing and shooting the hell out of stuff on King Of The Hill, If zombies is your thing try Breaking Point (These being the most popular) , If you cannot find something you like then you are doing it wrong.   But i will not sugar coat it too much but it can be a steep learning curve for those new to the game and yes there are performance issues for some and it can be a challenge for some rigs but the game is still good at 30fps or dare i say it even 25(from personal experience). There are many forums with tips, tweeks and setups that can help you get the most from your Arma experience. It may take a little bit of time but it is worth it.
1406	1	a	Fantastic, only issue i have are the overly complex controls.
174	1	a	Military sandbox. Fun. Niche.  Terrible game, though. 10 year old engine doesn't do it any good. Would fail immediately if there was any competition.
3378	1	a	it a cool
3052	1	a	Best Strategy-Shooter !  buy it if you like it ;)
3423	1	a	10/10  Pros: Guns Greece GUNNS Good maps Awesome RP Mod(s)  Cons: No Shotguns Kavala is Lag city No other cons
4406	1	a	Its ok
4708	1	a	Not for the COD or BF player, there is no bunny hopping here. Arma is a combat simulator. The learning curve is high but the overal exp IMHO is awesome. I've played them and I cant wait for the polished version to be released.  
2368	1	a	Great Game!   I would Recommend To those who love First Person/Third Person Shooters and Realistic Shooters  Cant get anymore real than this :)
3279	1	a	The WorldÂ´s one and only Military Simulation Game ! If you want an awesome Team-based and realistic Military Simulation this is the only right choice for you !  Nothing for Solo-Player like COD or Battlefield !!! THIS IS NOT KILL ON SIGHT AND ITS NOT AN EGO-SHOOTER OR ARCADE-SHOOTER,ITS A MILITARY SIMULATION...THERE IS NO SPACE FOR RAMBOÂ´S !!! If you are a lone wolf and think you could kill an enemy squad alone or something...They will show you are wrong. You cant survive more than MAX 3-5 bullets based on your hitzones !  ARMA 3 : THIS IS WAR
1482	1	a	shot a guy in a helicopter  11/10 ign best game of the year
3811	1	a	I liked the part when I got shot.
4023	1	a	I think this game is great buy it omg im crying to my mom because she slaps the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of me please help she wanted me to review this game help
2491	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥!
2606	1	a	9,5/10 great graphics and gameplay. buy this game if you want to: -make your own mission -be a solider -be a pilot -be a tank crew -be a civilian with a better life then you :P -die of mines -want to move from bf 4/3/hardline -love teamwork  if any of them over match what you want/do buy this game
4402	1	a	A great first-person shooter that's been around for a while now, but has been kept fresh thanks to the DLC and the mod community. There's a lot of love gone into this series, especially with the Tanoa map. It simply is a beautiful map to play. The only issue with this game is the resources the engine uses. It's infamous for sapping CPU cycles. But there's lots of help on the forums with assisting you tweak the game to provide the best FPS possible.  If you're wanting support for this game however, it is best to use Steam's community Arma 3 forum, as the official BI Arma 3 forum is now run by some (not all) overzealous moderators who move, delete and lock threads for no real reason other than they're not adhereing to whatever it is they believe is 'their' interpretation of the rules. In short, if the mods don't agree with or like your post, they'll move, delete or lock it.    
3375	1	a	Straight out awsome game to play with the friends
1387	1	a	if you like tactical military simulation genre, buy this, try to explore arma world like altis life, wasteland, and many more cant stop play without it 11/10 
59	1	a	This is quite possibly the most emotional shooter I've ever played, and it's not because of the campaign.   Crowd around, children, it's story time.  One day, not so long ago, my squad had just destroyed an anti-air battery. Our pilot landed, and the rest of the squad boarded one by one. I was about to get in when the rockets started flying.  The chopper lifted off, with my pilot saying that he would return in a few minutes. Unwilling to die before then, I rushed to the nearest cover, a small house by a narrow road. I entered to find a ten year-old player who had also been left behind. He explained that he was a sniper and invited me to join his 'clan'.  I politely declined, explaining that my own squad was inbound. As I finished, a Ghost Hawk flew over the horizon. My squad had arrived.  This noble child soldier and I were sprinting to the helicopter when the bullets started hitting. The sniper screamed as a 6.5 mm cartridge entered his leg. His shrieks for help were cut short by one final burst of carbine fire as I climbed in the transport.  My new friend was dead.  10/10, would experience survivor guilt again.
3489	1	a	This game is very intertaining. You can have lots of fun by playing the campaign or online. I find the best thing to playis the mod breaking point. This is a dayz like game that has a lot less problems. You can pick a faction each time you die and respawn.
1145	1	a	So many glitches and bugs.... you need to play just cause of that. It makes you rofl a lot.    Great Sim with sometimes funny Physics :D seriously... Never had such fun in a shooter since BF2...  Arma3 is much more tactical tho. Very addicting and challenging game which is still getting updates and bugfixes plus a great DLC incoming soon with free Updates included for non DLC owners.  Apex Update: Great Expansion with a really lovely created new map. The included Engine Upgrade for normal and DLCÂ´s clients is very nice. Still can recommend this game a lot... If you have some friends to play with this is really a great Tactical Sim with a lot of fun, action and very very special moments. ;D
846	1	a	It is a great game to play. A lot of traveling to do as well and many things to explore within the world.
3069	1	a	My friend and I have both loved this game! I'd also recommend checking up on the launch arguments for optimization. If you read up on the game you'll find out that it's heavily run on a single CPU core (so you need a fast processor). But using the multithreaded launch options and other arguments to the startup can help you run it better  My favorite moment in this game has been walking around at night and hearing 'allahu akbar' through my speakers then a thunderous 'BOOM' through my subwoofer from off in the distance. My friend said 'Rebel, lets get involved!' Craziness obviously ensued!
4507	1	a	11/10 Ruined my entire life. Arma will ruin every single military shooter on the planet for you. If you are looking for a game that will completely cut you off from civilization, Arma is the game for you!
542	1	a	Pros  - Very Well Optimised  - Amazing Mod Support  - Massive Maps - Fantastic Graphics  Cons  - Dated Engine - No Australian Servers For My Favourite Mod (Battle Royal) - Horrible Community - Slow Dev Support   Fantastic Game If Played With Friends Defenetly Worth A Buy
392	1	a	As you can see from this review, I have almost 500 hours in the game, so if you're looking for someone who knows it, trust me. Arma 3 is a Military Simulator, which means that you aren't getting the constant grinding, free-for-all match ups you find in FPS games like Call of Duty or Battlefield. It also doesn't get much more realistic than this.   But in terms of the actual game, there are a plethora of things to do. There are Altis Life RPG servers, which allow you to play the way you want, within certain constraints of course. There are wasteland servers as well, which is essentially a giant battlefield for you to play in. Also, if you get a group of people, you can run some pretty awesome missions, not to mention have a blast with the Zeus mode, which allows a player to become a game master and run a mission dynamically.  Yes, there are bugs. Driving full force with a truck into a tank probably wouldn't cause it to blow up, for example. Rocks, walls, and even chicken-wire fences can disable plenty of vehicles, and sometimes the actual mechanics are pretty slow. But the major bugs that you find are usually because of some faulty coding in a server you play on, such as dropping a truck from a helicopter, only to have it disappear the next instant, or fling back up and blow you out of the sky.   Regardless of these, the actual content of Arma 3 is massive, and the situations you can create get to be incredibly intense. The $59.99 price tag on this game shouldn't stop you from buying it, because it is worth every penny. If you want to find some examples of people who play this game and have a great time, you can find a ton of videos on YouTube that may help you in your decision to buy it. Lastly, I mentioned before that this is not a Call of Duty or Battlefield game. They are all there own, and you may think that this game is too slow-paced if you are looking for that run-and-gun format of a game. But whileplaying this game, you find yourself in many different situations. Whether it be sneaking up to a compound while trying to avoid any contact, laser-designating a target for air-support to pulverize, or peaking around and pieing corners in a CQB scenario, you will find thousands of these unique situations, which make this game worthwhile to nearly every fan of FPS's and MILSIM's alike.
115	1	a	Stop commenting on my review.  EDIT: Get a life.
2659	1	a	Outstanding game. A must have!
869	1	a	Awesome game. If you played Bohemia's other games in the series, Arma 2 and Arma 2 OA, then you HAVE to get this. The graphics are beautiful (although you need a good computer obviously to run it well) the combat still feels a little stiff, but it's a huge improvement from the last games. They added an actual working physics engine and the features (inventory system, gun attachments, etc.) are top notch. The use of tactic and strategy is required so if you like that kind of stuff then you'll like this. It's still a pretty early release so I'm sure they will be releasing more vehicles and guns soon. Also, it comes equipped with the steam workshop, which is amazing considering steam's community is great at making modifications that make the game ten times better. Just get the damn game already!
2016	1	a	IZ THE BOMB I R8 8
3738	1	a	:)
3953	1	a	Got shot for and apple. 10/10
28	1	a	Started playing back in about 2005. Log in and win a couple every couple years now. Always a classic. By far my favorite game ever.
416	1	a	This is great
3573	1	a	This game is a different breed. For both the positives and negatives that brings with it, this game is truly a different breed.  I can easily say the best times I've had playing a video game have been in this game. Those times don't come easy though, and most videos don't do those times justice. Arma 3 is full of quailty people, but as it's seen significant growth, also growing amounts of trolls and not-so-friendly players. If you can find a group of players with a similar mindset and enough talent, you will have a fantastically unique time in this game.  Unlike most mainstream shooters, this game is almost entirely community based. Sure, Arma 3 itself is controlled and developed by Bohemia, but once you get in-game you are most likely playing a creation of another player. This completely opened ended sandbox of opportunities also has it's downsides though.  For one, performance isn't top notch. The game doesn't perform horribly in most cases, but a poorly scripted mission may lead to a drastic FPS decrease. Networked play will opperate fine under vanilla or well-created missions on a beefy server, but adding in a lot of players and custom scripts will quickly lead to major, annoying dsync.   The creative freedom in this game also means that expecting to launch the game, join any open server, and bunker down for some fun isn't a realistic expectation. A vast majority of the servers are community operated, meaning there are some very good and very poor servers. Apart from the diversity in game modes (a positive element), many of the same game modes (or missions) are modified by their respective server owners. This could mean some extra goodies, or some unexpectedly low FPS.  For all the negatives this game has, the positive elements will easily and repeated lead me to highly recommend this game. Just know what you're signing up for before purchasing ;)
5033	0	a	This game was released in September 2013 without a single player campaign. Part 1 of 3 DLC s to add it was released in October. Its now Christmas and and whilst there has been other updates for multiplayer, the final 2 DLCs that add the missing single player campaign are no where in sight....  It will probably be years before we see them and the fan boys will consider that good service.... Personally I do not.... My advice... save your money for something else.
223	1	a	BESTEST GAME EVER SINCE BATTLEFIELD2!  yes, I said it =) If you played BF2 and you loved it, but hated all its successors... Arma3 is the deal. This game is what should`ve followed BF2, it`s pure, awesome, tough and unforgiving warfare. It`s NOT made for easy (or rather noobish) play, you can`t run for a mile and expect to be able to shoot straight the instance you stop running; you can`t either fly your AttackHelicopter slamming into trees and buildings along the way and expect to be alive... ArmA does not do that, you die, you get hurt, in any case, you do stupid stuff... you will pay for it.  It`s a Mil-Sim, not an Arcade-Shooter like all the other 'tripleA' titles out there:  you want a challenge? - get ArmA3! you want realistic movement? - get ArmA3! you want realistic weaponshandling? - get ArmA3! you want honest (!) and hard working developers? - get ArmA3! you want a game with HUNDREDS (or more) mods to chose from as you like? - get ArmA3! you want your own skill to be the baseline on how your play has influence on the battle/game? - get ArmA3!  By all the good stuff mentioned, it`s only fair to tell about bad/unfortunate things Arma3 offers: This game needs a good CPU, not an ok one, a good CPU... and a fair amount of tweaking to get it run somewhat smoothly. And for MultiPlayer: Client`s performance is dependant on Server`s performance, you can have a beast computer, but if the server you play on sucks, your fps will suck aswell. You`ll have to learn this game before you can be really good at it...  and then when you`re good, Arma3 is deeply satisfying.  Just for personal comparison:  I now have more hours of Arma3 playtime (1500h+), than ALL hours of ALL Battlefields I`ve played over the years combined! Thats the message, yes =)  AND IT DOESNT GET BORING YET!!!
531	1	a	With over 3,100 hours, I think I am more than qualified to tell you about the game.   So, what is ArmA 3? ArmA 3 is a tactical fps/third person shooter simulator. Quite a mouthful huh? ArmA 3, I would have to say is by far the best game I have ever played, and until ArmA 4 comes out, the best game I will ever play. Bohemia has truelly one upped most, if not all, shooting games out there to date. And with the mature, professional community that plays ArmA 3, it is not hard to find excellent modifications to the game. Some of the best community game mods I can recommend to you right now are Altis Life and ArmA 3 Life.   However, should you find yourself more interested in the tactical side of ArmA, there are units out there that replicate real world military units, that provide tactical gameplay, as well as assisting you to better yourself in the field of ArmA 3. But before you go do anything, be sure to play the campaign, as that will help you learn ArmAs mechanics, and assist you in your career of ArmA. While I myself am still looking for a role play server. There are plenty of MilSim units out there though. 173rd Airborne Brigade, 15th MEU. Currently I am apart of the 173rd and can almost guarantee that you will enjoy it. Recruiting Now.   TeamSpeak IP: ts3.173rd.us  Website Link:  http://beta.173rd.us/index.php? 
4086	1	a	Arma 3 great game. Great graphics. But you need a great computer to run max settings at a decent FPS
4599	1	a	Difficult, absorbing, I want it so badly.
2039	1	a	This game is great. The mechanics, weapons, modes, are all awesome. My biggest issue is the optimization, which, depending on your personal preference, may render it unplayable. I'm running an AMD FX-8350 along with a GTX 970 with 4 GB of VRAM, and I can barely hold 30 frames in the multiplayer, even on low settings. For the most part it will run at about 25 FPS. In the single player I can usually get around 45 FPS or so, but not much more.   It really seems like they did not optimize the game what-so-ever. Personally, I don't mind the occassional frame drop, but it is certainly annoying seeing as how realistic the game is. My CPU and GPU should be more than enough to have this game completely maxed out at 60 FPS with no drops. Unfortunately though, they really didn't do anything with the game's optimization.  I still think it's fun, but if frame drops or a low frame rate bother you, I'd stay very far away. I imagine even on super high end hardware it would still have considerable issues.
3893	1	a	The Cold War was a state of political and military tension after World War II between powers in the Western Bloc (the United States, its NATO allies and others) and powers in the Eastern Bloc (the Soviet Union and its satellite states). Historians do not fully agree on the dates, but a common timeframe is the period between 1947, the year the Truman Doctrine (a U.S. policy pledging to aid nations threatened by Soviet expansionism) was announced, and 1991, the year the Soviet Union collapsed.  
4360	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ terribly unoptimised like 20 fps with gtx970
378	1	a	Incredible and immersive experience for fans of proper war games. The attention to detail is outstanding, the weapons, player gear and vehicles are completely authentic, right down to the tiniest details. The audio is amazing, the sound of bullets peppering your surroundings while you're in the fetal position praying that your cover is sufficient, explosions that sound as badass as they look, the sound of your weaponary, it's all done amazingly well. The gameplay forces you to play more or less how you would in a real life situation, using military tactics and teamwork to advance your position, you'll get â¥â¥â¥â¥in' used as a mop if you're thinking about getting those 'sick kill streaks' you get in those â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ console shooters. On a technological scale, Arma 3 is by far the most advanced and impressive game I've ever played, nothing comes remotely close. Right now, the game has optimization issues although they seem to be ironing that out, you'll need a powerful rig to experience this game in all it's glory.
2806	1	a	This game singlehandedly ruined my life, one of the most addicting games ive ever played. 10/10
3327	1	a	Such an amazing game, especially for serious gamers!
2379	1	a	love itlooks better then DAY Z
3588	1	a	Got pulled over going 300 in a 100 km/h zone got a warning. got pulled over going 115 in 100 km/h zone and got $1,500 fine. 10/10
2549	1	a	Military simulator with a steep learning curve. By far the most realistic shooter ever made. I love the game, but it is no run and gun BF game.
4783	1	a	this game is awesome for its multiplayer and campaign and dont forget the editor part, oh gawd how many hours i have spent on editor so yeah i recommend this game if you like action and tactical combat. the dlc's on this game is great, my personal favorite dlc is the heli dlc cause i love to fly helicopters in that game, it has also a go-kart dlc and that's very fun with friends to race with. so yeah i rate 10/10
4852	1	a	Fantastic game. Full or suprises and great realism!
620	1	a	For ALL of the mods you get when you buy the game from Epoch to Breaking Point to Battle Royale &amp; Wasteland, this game is one of the best that Steam can offer.   Easily worth $60 but sometimes you can find it on sale.
2240	1	a	It is just awesome
2422	1	a	Decent game, although a bit graphics intensive. Uber-realistic. Have fun finding enemies...
3127	1	a	Brilliant game, graphics A1, audio A1, gameplay perfection, couldnt possibley be a better combat game currnetly on the market
3699	1	a	One of the best realism simulators out there. Workshop content makes hours of fun with friends as well as helps the more advanced servers you can find out there.
2879	1	a	Fun simulator, good graphics, BIS is good people.
959	1	a	This is a good game. :P
2346	1	a	One of the best combined arms simulations i have ever played. The gameplay is only hindered by the people and community you play with. Play with an exciting group of people or with friends and you will have all the funny, stupid, and downright awsome moments you can only have in a few combined arms game. However playing by your self is not always boring but not always fun. So what are you waiting for try this game out and if you want find a good clan to hang out with and have fun.
103	1	a	i think ive finnished learning the controls ill update once i play.
1738	1	a	WARNING : DO NOT buy this game, if you do, you'll never see the sunlight again !
4622	1	a	This is a great game. They've fixed a lot of the wonkiness from Arma 2, and the community workshop adds TONS of content.
662	1	a	THIS GAME HAS A STEEPER LEARNING CURVE THAN ANY OTHER GAME - I STARTED TO GIT GUD AT THIS GAME @ AROUND 250 HRS -other than that it is a great game and I would never not recommend it!
2814	1	a	If you're looking for a smoth 60 fps multiplayer experience, then go away.  Unless you own a NASA computer.
1064	1	a	Very good game. I play it almost every day and I never get bored. Best way to describe it is a foundation for mod creators and developers to make new missions and gamemodes. I'm in a semi-milsim group called Section  7.(http://www.s7-gaming.com) . I also stay in the life mod scene as well as player made missions and scenarios. If you have the money and the short time it takes to learn the mechanics you will have a blast! 10/10
1631	1	a	I got the Game for full price, and the Game goes on sale the next day, but i would buy the Game all over again.  Fun game
4463	1	a	Good game. It's not worth 60 bucks. Game is glitchy and still needs lots of works. Feels like a Alpha/beta game.
1570	1	a	+Many sandbox modes from the community that ar every well done +very good game overall  -the damage model -you lose magazines randomly sometimes  (usually in vanilla servers)
5223	1	a	Do i recommend this game? Is the sky blue?
1057	1	a	played a few hours and done nothing in a server of day z mod. but at school all i was think bout was this game im addicted to it help me.  good game, ez to get into ,fun, addictive and want to play it all the time but cant because of school   â¥â¥â¥â¥ u school and let me play arma 3 and â¥â¥â¥â¥ me grades
4905	1	a	ArmA III, a product by the company in which has been the start of my gaming days. ArmA III offers a new atmosphere to the gaming community with countless diffrent modding communities, diffrent maps to choose from, and a long list of game modes such as Survival, Zombie Survival, Roleplaying, Military Simulation, and much more. New game modes are always being made and overall the game its self is worth it becuase it has an endless line of fun and variation.
1323	1	a	Played Arma2 and Arma2 arrowhead, all i can say it has the same spirit, the same awesomness like the others, maybe for me it's too desert type map, i liked more grass, but there plenty of mods to fix that. And of course Battle Royale + Breaking Point makes it even more playable, and KOTH or Wasteland is still FUN AS HELL! And not to forget about Life mode it's simply amazing MUST TRY!
1900	1	a	very cool and realistic game. enjoyed playing this in the short time that i did but was fantastic. there is also a huge mod and extras selection for the game too, so there's a lot to do. well worth the price and would recommend buying this. i also was playing with specs almost the minimum requirements so i cant fully say how graphical it is as i didn't have them up on full but iv'e also seen videos on full graphics and its incredible.
2079	1	a	  I love this game 10/10 great game
3106	1	a	This is the best military simulator and there is so much content for the game you could play a new thing every day for the rest of your life it just all around an amazing game
2718	1	a	good game to bad i suck at it XD
5233	1	a	Call of Duty for kids, Battlefield for teenagers, Arma for real men
5172	1	a	like am relly a sowjer, gunz an tankz anss then big asplowshunz
848	1	a	arma 3 is awesome!
5069	1	a	Self defence is RDM.
3849	1	a	arma 3 is the best war simulation game . i am recommend you to play this game
4650	1	a	nice game but you will need a beast of a pc
2664	1	a	I guess bohemia thought human eyes are 15 fps
1353	1	a	THIS IS â¥â¥â¥â¥ING AWSOMEEEE!!!!
2249	1	a	Probably the most in-depth shooter game so far...
2227	1	a	GRAPHICS! IF YOU GOT THE SPECS, BUY IT!
4723	1	a	Very fun game. Need a pretty good system to run it but it is very good none the less. Performance issues no doubt it is fun. Not to happy on the price though
1274	1	a	Seems to be pretty good so far.
1079	1	a	The most strategic F.P.S game i have ever played. I love the game because it is filled with hard campain missions and an amazing multiplayer
5320	1	a	Where is the fire button? 
3589	1	a	The gameplay says it all. Awesome!
2577	1	a	7.5/10, not really a sim but it's pretty well made and there's a huge community.
4283	1	a	Absolutely love it!
2800	1	a	ArmA 3.. Been with you since Alpha and now Apex is coming. It's a great game, really isn't much more to say. If you want a challenging, time consuming and at the same time fun tactical shooter, this is the game for you. If you expect CoD or BF, go away, right now.  Pros:  - Great mechanics - Huuuge detailed maps with so many towns, cities and etc - Enjoyable vehicular combat and mechanics - Great (but cliche) single player campaign for a first person shooter - Fun multiplayer with unlimited gamemodes to download as mods - Eden Editor makes it fun to set up your own missions for training/fun - Great modding community  Cons:  - The engine should be replaced for the next title, very unoptimized with huge frame drops even on good PCs. - The action menu needs to go, seriously. - A bit of a pain to set up a joystick for fixed-wings/helicopters - Rain/storms could still look better, happens you see patches of blue sky right above your head  For any tactical shooter fan out there, this is a must have. But try to go into the game without comparing it to other FPS games. Just because it can be hard and has complex mechanics, doesn't mean the game sucks
5327	0	a	BUGS, BUGS AND MORE BUGS, CANT EVEN LOAD THE CAMPAIGN WITHOUT IT CRASHING. Quite annoyed as i played about 7 hours before the bugs hit me and i cant get a refund.
5062	1	a	This is a great game it has beutiful graphics good gameplay. It makes me fell like im actuall in a real war.
856	1	a	Great game, wish It could run better on my PC but the game itself is awesome.
377	1	a	This game is brilliant, as all the other reviews will most-likely say too.  It's very simular to Arma 2 of course but with even more added features, improved UI's and stunning graphics. The campaign is a little tricky but that's part of the fun and the online multiplayer is extremely enjoyable. It kind of reminded me of Battlefield mixed with Planetside? - Either way, some of the most enjoyable PC gaming can easily be had playing this work-of-art game!   Anything bad to say? No. Although many have most-likely listed a full article on all the flaws and glitches. Honestly, I didn't notice anything bad whilst playing neither will you unless you're a straight-out critic.
2926	0	a	Stephen Hawking runs better than this game. If you have some seriously beefy hardware you can run this game 60+ fps. But for us simple plebs, we get solid 30's and 20's. Fun otherwise :)
3412	1	a	Bought this game for the Breaking point (Dayz) mod,but i decided to give Epoch and Altis life a try.It was a blast i had a great time playing with friends,so i tought i should play the campaign,i'm sorry to say that it was horrible,the AI was dumb as F*ck even at the hightest level of difficulty,and sometimes game would crash at the end of a cutscene(although this might be an issue on my end).So overall i think that arma 3 is a great choice for those who want to play online,if you are looking for a good singleplayer campaign you might wanna avoid arma 3.
2963	1	a	I have logged over 100 hours on ARMA 3 and I can honestly say it has been one of the most enjoyable gaming experiences I have had to date. The multiplayer servers feel like MILSIM and players are for the most part, willing to play the way ARMA is meant to be played. As far as campaigns go, ARMA 3 has had my favorite by far in the franchise, with an interesting story and developments in the plot, not to mention a realistic protagonist who doesn't just blindly follow orders (unless you make him because you have the choice in ARMA 3). Overall I'd give this game a 9/10
3626	1	a	10/10 would spend hundreds of hours on game again
4184	1	a	the morning after i had downloaded this game i procede to relive my life experences. id like to start off my life with telling everyone i had failed english every year till 8th grade, it â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sucked. so i was living my life and i decided to live my life like a man on xbox live likes to live to live my life to life long standards of living to exceding life goals set by people who are alive. once apon a time i was â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ by a asian girl. so next time we meet on the avengers i decided to play arma 3. as i was held pinned down in a building i thought of my military training from my time in the military. so i proceded to out military the man in the military and proceded to win the war and saved america. did i mention was was â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ when i was 14? 10/10 would bang.
73	1	a	Arma 3 has taught me that 10 FPS is playable.
1668	1	a	this game is good
280	1	a	If you love Arma II you're going to love Arma III. They improve on a lot of the functionality of the game. Very smooth experience and multiplayer is very fun and challenging.
3242	1	a	A fantastic military sandbox with many addons &amp; mods to experiment with. It has its fair share of cons and pros, the cons laying mostly with the multiplayer portion of the game and the decency of your PC.  If you intend to buy this game, I recommend upgrading the specs on your PC to something of above average. I'm not saying that if you have a PC with not as up-to-date specs that you won't have the same ArmA3 experience, I'm just saying that in order to get more out of this game you may want to consider doing so.  Singleplayer is fantastic. With the steamworks support and modding support this game has, singleplayer is a blast aside from the campaign. Definitely a game aimed at more hardcore players, singleplayer dishes out an amazing campaign as well as scenario missions. You'll notice that in singleplayer the game is easier to run and achieve higher fps.  Multiplayer is a piece of work, it really depends whos hosting, what gamemode you are playing, and if your PC specs are able to handle the stress. Playing gamemodes like Altis Life and King of The Hill you'll notice that you are able to play on nicer graphics settings and achieve higher fps than playing modes like Capture the Island or Cooperative (Invade &amp; Annex). Playing the latter 2 you might find yourself having to run at lower settings and/or have lower fps. This doesn't mean you won't be able to enjoy these gamemodes for yourself, it just means all those snazzy, jazzy looks and feels won't be high end.  Away from the cons and on to the pros, this game is one of the best military sims/sandboxes out there. With ArmA3's many details and functions you can find yourself commanding a squadron of soldiers into battle, relaxing on an tropical island, or even building your own mission. Whether you are a hardcore or casual gamer, this game has got you covered.  All in all, I'd give this game a 9/10
1374	1	a	Altis Life is dead dont even buy this game.
945	1	a	great game
3206	1	a	  its a good game
4554	1	a	Gather a group of friends and play on a wasteland server! Very fun and very intense gameplay if you go for the missions that pop up on the map, but make sure you gather resources like good weapons, armor, food and water, beacause your enemies will.
5097	0	a	This isn't really a game, it's more like a dev tool kit for a military shooter. Soldier movement is dated probably the only negative comment related to graphics/physics. There are a couple missions made by arma...and a couple 'showcases' that show you what their vehicles/weapons/drones can do. The training in this game is below average..and the keyboard mapping is â¥â¥â¥â¥ poor, overly complicated, and hard to reference. No built in multiplayer like it suggests. Players host their own servers but it's not like BF4, these servers most are locked, others if you d/l this workshop item you can't get in, or if you didn't download another workshop item you can't get in. If you do get in, there's weird rules and no one to tell you what to do.   Conclusion Great platform/developer kit, but i paid good money for a 'game' and as such there's a handful of single player missions, no fmv cut scenes, the 'multiplayer' is not supported through arma only through community, no mission types or user friendly options. soldier animations are oddly dated for an advanced military shooter.
3026	1	a	I bought it expecting my PC to handle it. It couldnt take 41 hours of island life so I went back to arma 2 for now.  Real review: Make sure your computer is good, and no the one recommended to you by the best buy geek squad for 4000 dollars wont cut it. Just build your own like me but make sure your price range is over 700 dollars, gl.
5331	0	a	this is a great game at its core but horrible optimization and bad players ruins it.
69	1	a	This game is the reason my girlfriend of four years and I broke up.  I do not regret a thing.
1765	1	a	Full review  here  
3520	1	a	I must say this is the best shooting game I have ever played.Maybe it's quite unfriendly to the newcomers but in others aspects it is epic.Highly recommended to military lovers.
3505	1	a	listen, i dont really give a â¥â¥â¥â¥ about planning out huge tactical sieges online with my friends or mods or realism or anything like that i just really appreciate that this is a game where i can run myself over with an unmanned jeep
5091	0	a	This game is beyond disappointing. It has so many elements to make it the best... whatever the â¥â¥â¥â¥ it wants to be, but it's too buggy and unoptimized. There really is no excuse for Arma 3 to run this bad at this stage of development. Honestly this game is in alpha, whether it says 'full release' or not. There is a huge lack of content compared to the previous Arma. Arma 3 has just about 1/4 of what arma 2 had. The saddest thing overall is the fact that there has been no effort to fix this game in quite sometime. I am fairly certain that Bohemia has the resources, but they refuse to even bother with it.  THEY SERIOUSLY USED RESOURCES TO MAKE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING KARTS (a presumably broken waste of money) INSTEAD OF FIXING THEIR â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ING GAME.
5286	1	a	God make this game
2163	1	a	This game will make you more concentrated and patient. you will love it as i do.
1714	1	a	Pretty Good, Too many 1 years olds doe   5year old/10
5120	0	a	waste of 40$ â¥â¥â¥â¥ you.spend more time trying to play then actually playing
2499	1	a	I love this game the online suervers are full of pople to have fun with
4243	1	a	Arma 3 takes the best of the series and improves the infantry movement and animation system leaps forward. The game francise has had no competition in the market ( No there really is not competition from BF4 or codemasters tinkering called Operation Flashpint 2). Only other game that comes close is WW2 Online battleground europe. But that game is in respirator and waiting for the doctor to shut down the life support because horrid development decisions from dews.  Arma 3 is the best combined arms simulation in the market period. The mod community around the game is amazing. You really get tens or hundreds of games for the price of one. If you do not like the near future renamed vehicles there allready is heaps of current military gear and vehicles available. All the previous maps of the series are available free and working in the new engine. Main portion of the previous games vehicles are ported to Arma 3. You even have role playing servers up to hundreds of players per server if that is your thing.  The developer is allso leader of providing combined arms simulator to military. Virtual battlespace 3 (VBS3) is used by US and many NATO countries. Bohemia is committed to update the game and we saw firs major update to the helicopter physics with more complex flight models with rotor lib from Take on Helicopters simulation. And allso physics based slingloading and more to come.   Bullet pearsing and drop is calculated. day night cycle, acurate star map to navigate from if you forgot your compass in night mission. endles mission opportunitys in land, sea and air.  Its a solid 10/10 because no other game comes even close.
482	1	a	The Playtime speaks for itself really....
1258	0	a	It's a really epic game, but the sad fact of the matter is, it's optimized like â¥â¥â¥â¥ and not likely to get any better. My system is decent, and I'm not going to argue the point, but nobody should have to be buying new fá¹»cking chipsets to get 60fps on a game this old, especially when it's more than a year old.  Gameplay? It's really fun, unless you're dÃ¯cking around in one of the thousands of poorly setup servers where you can only get like 13fps tops because whoever is running it is incompetent.  There's a TON of mod support. You can literally download gigs and gigs of mods from the workshop to do all kinds of things and it's amazing.   Get it on sale if you're going to get it, and don't buy this unless you have a significantly powerful cpu.
2660	1	a	A great game with lots of potential. I love the combat, vehicles and customization goes as far as your heart's content. With the open world maps there are almost countless places to fight. The A3Launcher is a must-have if you want to go past the limits of the default game. It will give more content and new servers to play on.   The community varies alot. There are so many different types of players on this game. It'd be a lie if I said the community's great. Honestly it needs some major working on. There are some players on this game who are helpful and more friendly and there's some who can be rude and oblivious. It may be different for other players who experience with otherpeople. But this is just my opinion.  The gameplay adjusts to your environment. You must use it to your advantage, if you don't you'll probably end up dieing. If your on a team based gamemodes like king of the hill and invade &amp; innex and for example; Your in a car and driving down the main road with passangers and the main road is guarded by tanks and infantry. You should probably go around the main road onto a side road to lower the chances of you and your teammates dieing.  Overall, I would give this game a 7.5 / 10. 
2180	1	a	2300 hours in Arma III, speaks for itself. IF you looking for realistic bullet and weapons behavior, Arma its the best choice. But Arma III Vanilla will not keep you for long, its the mods that keep this game alive so look for good ones like Breaking Point, Tactical Battlefield. Game is great but has a lot of annoying bugs that are in game not fixed for years like ladders, stairs and bulletproofbushes. Still the best game i ever played...
3822	1	a	The most fun you can have with your clothes on.
5341	0	a	Uses OFP engine from 10 years ago. Recommends GTX 560, I have 580 and NEVER get more than 20 fps no matter what my settings are. This game was made by dirty slavaboo gopniks who have no â¥â¥â¥â¥ing clue what they're doing.
2967	1	a	*** PLEASE READ FULL REVIEW ***  Do you like army based games? Like to play realistic army games, or roleplaying at it's finest? This game is something for you then. I played for a few hours, yet the time feels like 1 hour. You lose complete track of time when you along with 50 other men try in a cooperative mission to take over a city against tanks, choppers, jets, snipers and all the other military infantries guarding it!   8/10 - Great realistic military gameplay.  *** Buy it if you like army games! ***
2437	1	a	I personally don't know what to say because writing a really long review is stupid. But i highly recommend this game, by far one of the best games i have played in my lifetime. The great mod support, the variety of gamemodes to choose from. Its just simply great. Buy it
806	1	a	11/10
2266	1	a	Really fun, but a different kind of fun than your typical shooter. This is about planning, bringing the right gear, the right friends, the right objectives and trying to execute the plan. Even with the AI on the lowest possible setting, they're geniuses compared to any other shooter out there. Take your time, be patient and work your way through the objective. Fun under the right circumstances
4210	0	a	More of an engine than an actual game.  Even if you disregard the absolutely horrid control scheme and terribly unoptimized engine as well as the stiff animations, One of the, if not The most complicated game ever to start playing.  It's impossible to just pick up and play. You have to download a gorillion mods and other tools that the community considers 'essential'. Once you do get into a game, expect 2 hours to fly by where you do nothing but walk around.  Some people swear by the game and have put hundreds, even thousands of hours into it. These people have my respect, as they have put aside enough time to allow the academic research that this game requires before it becomes fun. I just can't set aside that time.  
1956	1	a	I have no idea what the hell I'm doing. I've spent most of the time riding in a helicopter and then getting blown up but hey IT LOOKS SO FUN
2358	1	a	most def one of the best shooters i have ever played
3383	1	a	You enter combat with your team/squad, hop in a chopper, fly to destination, parachute in, forget to pull chord, fall to death. Would jump again 10/10.  In all honesty, I would say get this game. It's hard to learn, but it gets so good once you learn how, and you get into a combat zone, and bullets are wizzing by, jets flying overhead, and then you hear an explosion, and the house on the next block is destroyed.
4598	1	a	Pretty amazing game lots of addons and user made missions to play would reccomend 10/10
3238	1	a	This Game is Nothing But Amazing.... I Don't Have A Bad Word To Say About This Game... This Game is Even Better When Being Used To Play DayZ.... A Must Have For Any ArmA Fan
4047	1	a	ArmA 3 is THE most detailed combat simulator you can find for a PC . There's much improvement from ArmA 2 , including smarter UI, more natural feeling movement and so on. Community support is excellent, with mods and scenarios created by the day, keeping the game fresh for a long time. A must buy if you are looking for a more 'serious' shooter than your average Counter-Strike.
4439	1	a	Good game so many mods and addons a 3d scenario editor just get teamspeak get a couple of friends and arma is the best game ever but i have 1 problem NOT WORKING ON MAC OS i want to buy a Mac Pro and i want to play arma bohemia pls Apple is the best company ever why dont u support mac almost every american has a mac book or a mac pc and im planning to buy one too cuz theyre so good and the beautiful apple on it is the most important part getting a little bit off topic huh ?
1153	1	a	the price is to high 
1743	1	a	After playing this game for so many hours, i never cease to entertain myself! Whether it's fighting Hostile forces for control in King of the hill, Executing your enemies in wasteland or Fighting for survival in ARMA 3's very own version of DayZ.  This game is great, recently DayZ was ported from ARMA 2 into ARMA 3, and must i say its exquisite it's a perfect port and Overpoch is a ton of fun.  I was hooked on Altis life for a very long time, the roleplay in that gametype is amazing, if your unsure of what Altis life is, check it out on youtube there are plenty of vids showcasing it ;)  Wasteland is where team tactics can really come out, You choose to join one of three teams which include the : Blufor (NATO), OpFor (CSAT) or the Independent (AAF).   In conclusion this game is great! Even if you don't have any friends to play it with you'll make friends incredibly easy. Since Overpoch has been ported it's added even more to the awesome!  Buy this, Enjoy it.  Jadex Out
4418	1	a	This ia an amazing game. Even for 60$. As it shows I have about 700 hours, and some of my friends have even more. Anyone that says they don't like Arma is lying
642	1	a	one of the best games out there
4751	1	a	10.0. The graphics for this game are amazing, but you may need to turn it down in case of lag. The Co-Op is awesome and its great to play with friends. Also on some servers it will get extremely laggy and hard for you to enjoy the game. Do research if you can run it before you buy it. Not a waste of $60.00.
4854	1	a	Awesome game countless hours of gameplay and theres always something new to experience.
1733	1	a	The definition of a military themed sandbox game. Part of a franchise that has been going strong since 2001, I have no doubt this newest installment will provide me and many others with countless hours of pure unadulterated fun!
4654	1	a	its arma. buy it
340	1	a	I haven't played it that much but i think it's alright ;)
1700	1	a	F**King Fantastic

1798	1	a	ArmA 3 helped my life so much, it increased my salt levels by 9000% and now I have the resources to deal with the â¥â¥â¥â¥ of real life. I have renamed my office at work to the Salt Room because, as a manager, I have to deal with peoples problems and issues and I felt it was only fitting.
2510	1	a	Thaught me how to use a grid properly, failed miserably due to lack of understanding of geometry. Education has failed me on geometry.
5085	1	a	Great game, worth the money
285	0	a	Too many lies.
4326	1	a	Arma 3 Best, Military Simulation
3472	1	a	By far. the best game i have ever played.

Edit: â¥â¥â¥â¥ off Battleye!
1132	1	a	This is a really really great game and worth every penny, very enjoyable with friends.
1655	1	a	Great fun game! make sure to chech out breaking point mod. Its good for a laugh or 2
5291	1	a	Had this game for quite a while - original review was actually made in oct 2014 - but didn't play it much due to gamebreaking bugs. But its Nov 2016 now and much changed.  I must say, after these 2 years, it matured damn well! See below for more information.  Conclusion: If you loved Arma 2, or if you love simulation/sandbox games, military topics and a very customizable battle experience, get this. It's worth it.  Some people may call the DLCs a bit overkill in terms of pricing, I must say, ~10â¬ for about 2 more helicopters is not quite nice.  BUT  theres the DLC Bundle! 17â¬ for all 3 DLCs that would else cost you 22â¬! I'm all for it, the developers deserve it after working so hard and even including great new features for free in the main game instead of just in the DLCs.  Please note that APEX is  NOT  to be comparised to the other DLCs! See it as Operation Arrowhead of Arma 2. It adds so much content that - even though I currently can't afford it - it sure is worth the price.  Now theres still much to do to keep this title afloat and BI seems to have still quite some surprises in their roadmap for us as well. Even though my initial reaction was tending to negative on Arma 3 back then, I can only have good hopes now.
2808	1	a	when you get 60fps in this game. 60fps=cheating in arma.
4001	1	a	This is one of the most fun games ive ever played 
695	1	a	Immerse, massive community, mods for everything and just good fun all round. Something for everyone's taste.
2387	1	a	With Arma, you will either love it or hate it. And if you happen to the one of the lucky ones, Arma 3 will keep you coming back for years, with a vast amount of content and replayability, I don't think I've ever experienced a situation the same way twice. With a control scheme that allows for finer movements and positioning and a map that is just oozing with detail. If you enjoyed Arma 2 (or Arma 1 for that matter) I would spare no time in picking this one up.
184	1	a	Pros: -One of the best if not greatest military simulator -Ability to be modded -Downloads missions and addons off steam -DLC is reasonably priced for the content -Exceptional graphics compared to ArmA 2  Cons: -Really buggy -Can lag some days but other days runs smooth -Some features could have been changed or even updated  Overall I would recommended this to anyone who wants to be heavily involved into a military sim that can either be modded to play zombies, roleplay or military pvp
2645	1	a	If you want some thrill and reality frustration along with good graphics,this is your war game. Good luck avoiding those bullets flying over your head. Teamwork is a must  If there is a (-) here for me is that you really need patience and hours to master the controls in order to enjoy it.
1054	1	a	great game well worth it
4440	1	a	pretty good tbh
3467	0	a	I personally dont like it becuase out of 13 hours of game play 10 of it was trying to fix errors popping up in the game. I have tryed EVERYTHING and some of them are not fixable. It has made me lose my mind.
1234	0	a	Very disapointed.
2161	1	a	Fun game. Really it is. I'm serious.
1763	1	a	10/10
710	1	a	1. Look at me hours mate. 2. Milsim. 3. Wasteland. 4. MODS. &lt;3 Arma 3
4704	1	a	I love this game. so much fun!!!
1292	1	a	Sniping people from about 2000m with a .50... Get's killed by AI 2000m away from me...with a pistol... Really good game 10/10 
3674	1	a	realistic military shooter filled with special children 10/10 i love driving an suv into a chinese military base and dying
2230	1	a	getitgetitgetit  Great multi-player game! Great modding community!
3594	1	a	This game will stand the test of time.
621	1	a	ArmA 3 Altis Life RPG-  Bought an illegal weapon worth $1,000,000 from a corrupt cop for $150,000, but was arrested by his friend! #WOULDBUYGUNFROMCORRUPTCOPAGAIN!  8/8 m8 - IGN
588	1	a	Own a computer with better than the recommended specs   20 fps on medium   10/10 would lie again
2523	1	a	OKE OKE   This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing awesome when u know how to do it. So take time when u are new and play the Bootcamp and the campaign .  For veterans its just join the battles and Multi sandbox modes in multiplayer mode.   
2893	1	a	Love it can't get. Enough of arma  
2512	1	a	first time i had ever played arma but instantly i loved the game and its interface brilliant game and lots to do its the best game for a reasonable amount of money.
4859	1	a	This game is great! It is its own category of games and is like no other. Its one of the best Military simulators I have ever played. It has a great community and many people dedicated to it! 10/10
3758	1	a	  Fun game, I love how I can run around and pretend I'm actually there! To bad the AI are quite bad, all-in-all, great game!
1471	1	a	Get this game...Hands down amazing
3089	1	a	Finally a game worth spending my hard earned $60 on. A fun game! Hate it when I take a bullet in the head, But hey, thats realism!
864	1	a	This game is a definite improvement over it's predecessor, despite the optimization issues for those running lower level Intel rigs or mid-high level AMD rigs. Even on low this game looks impressive and if you have an Intel CPU (or high level AMD CPU) &amp; Decent GPU (Either brand) you should be able to run it on high where the visuals are sure to impress.  The AI has improved over ARMA II, though not tremendously, You will still have issues commanding your squad to do exactly what you want them to but they're not quite as derpy.  If you decide to get this game you're definitely going to have fun with it, I strongly reccommend to google custom optimisation settings and tinker with it until you have the most stable frames you can achieve.  Finally, the modding community for this game is excellent, there are plenty of great mods on the workshop and community sites like ARMAHOLIC.
1443	1	a	Best game in Universe, 10 iluminati of 10
2951	1	a	Buy the awesomeness called arma 3 
2218	1	a	Greatest of All Time.
3084	1	a	I used to play CoD and Battlefield series and now I make fun of them. I used to think that no game will ever reproduce the chaos and unpredictability of war and I was wrong. I used to have a social life that has now been replaced by intense firefights and military operations of all kinds. ArmA is not a game like the others, it will bring war straight into your living room and it will show you all sides of it: brutal cruelty, the high price to pay for mistakes and the importance of teamwork and communication to achieve the objective. The Community content is huge and if you learn how to do it, there is no real limitation on what you can do as far as mission building and content go. The only regret I had when I first discovered this game was that I wish I had known it before.
2412	1	a	great combat sim be it as infantry or pilot, big platform, beautiful engine, lots of mods, different MP gameplays, great community, lots of sleepless nights when conducting large organized warfares it's the closest sim to real life, u either love it or hate it - there is no in between ;)
5237	0	a	The DLC policy of todays game developers is the worst possible thing that might ever come.   Arma 3 has limited content, but guess what? If you pay extra, you get extra content. Why sell full game once, when you can divide it into pieces and sell in parts?  I do not recommend.
2714	1	a	10/10 This is a great game if you are looking for something alot more realistic than COD or BattleField or anything else along those lines. From the campaigns beginning to end you are spending time to even get to the primary objective, this is great because you get to see how much time and effort went into this masterpiece. Then we get into the firefights every thing from learning how to shoot to mastering the ammount of bullet drop for each gun you can spend hours and even days mucking around with the hundreds of controls. On top of that there is DLC and user-made content and I for one cannot describe how much I am anticipating for a dayz mod for this game it would be amazing. 
1213	1	a	It created my love of artillery and mortars. But you know, it's great for other things too. Just buy it for the amazing milsim, waste of money for everything else it has.
4519	1	a	  Great war game! Got it on my last PC for a free weekend! I had loads of fun! Thinking about purchasing it for real now!
4679	1	a	This game is just great the combat the feel, it feels so amazing the atmosphere is so realistic. I must say tho online when I played at least seemed to lag or just wasn't optimized correctly (might be due to it being online and having tons of mods and so on.  Besides that the game is fantastic its so live you feel like a real soldier in battle taking shots and being shot at. Not like COD or Battlefield. Where your the leader and do pretty much anything. But ARMA has never been like that its been more of a real team based where every move you do counts towards the team and can and most likely put them at risk.  I would recommend for those who like full realistic combat.
610	1	a	Excellent game plenty of multiplayer options to suit all styles of play although for full enjoyment i would reccomend playing with froends
2863	1	a	Totally worth the arm it costs to buy it.
5004	1	a	Kids play COD, youth play BF, men play ArmA. 5/5 would glitch and fly to the sky and die again.
3973	1	a	Great game, load it up, optimize the sttings using GeForce. joins a game with a friends who recomended it. ... get 7 frames. thinks, meh if i just put all my settings on low. it will increase fps right? NO ultra settings: 7 fps low settings : 7 fps ... it's playable right? no * walks around * *gets shot from somewhere* * gets dragged to a medic by a friend * * gets revived * * sees enemy * * tries to aim with 7 fps * *dies * ... i would reccomend if you have a beastly pc. but do not try to play on an outdated laptop.
3847	1	a	Worth every penny, best game for graphic designs, but fps can be pretty frightening and is hard to gain fps. AFTER all that's the engine it's using. Would recommend to all gamers!
4928	1	a	Arma 3 is a really nice simulator. I really like the custom content here and this simulator is definitely going places.
989	1	a	I don't even own this game, but it's so good that I have transcended the mortal boundaries of Steam to write this.  &gt;starts a campaign game &gt;instantly sniped by AI in the first fight &gt;reload save game &gt;rinse and repeat  It's a very good military sandbox. Trust me, it's worth the weight.  
4543	1	a	BUY APEX worth every penny
5266	0	a	where are the zombies? 1/10
3400	1	a	I personally like the Game Modes and the ways you can play greatly Optmized game all you need a beefed up computer and you might be able to play on High or even Ultra Graphics I used to play on a Laptop which i could get over 20+ FPS now I have my New computer which can run at High with 30+ FPS and its still just as good as it was still love the Gamemodes and its even better to play. I really like his game and I hope you do too.
1005	1	a	If you have a good computer. And you like in the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Buy this!
4412	1	a	Uh Not too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for Pancakes instead  Ingredients: 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 3 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg 2 large eggs, at room temperature 1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as needed  Now to make it 1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg. 2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla. 3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. 4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed 5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed. 6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.
1356	1	a	ALPHA was very good BETA was kinda bad FULL GAME is crap
1097	1	a	This game rocks... if you like hardcore fps games, you canÂ´t miss this one. Also LOTS OF COMMUNITY MODS!!! I bought apex pack at 50% christmas, now 70 dlrs, is a bit salty, but its worth totally. Salutes from Argentina! PD: Battle Royale kicks a s s hard!!
769	1	a	You like realistic military games? Than this game is for you! Arma series has impressed me yet again. STeam workshop for this game pretty much adds a brand new game to arma 3. I use to play the deathmatch for arma or the coop for arma but now i find myself playing stratis life which is a life simulator. game gets updated a lot and adds new stuff every month. game is worth every penny  Pros open world military game everything is driveable small caves firefights are intense  Cons Dlc are overpriced buggy 
3430	1	a	Love this game! I like it because it is tactical and not COD. The ways you can tackle a mission is amazing!
2364	1	a	This is sick! depending on the type of game, you can team up in wasteland, have an all out war in team death match, snipers are amazing, so many rifles, 3 rocket launchers with a laser guidence system, grenades, smoke, and mortors! i love it
5014	1	a	Well, why should you buy this game?  If you think you've seen some glitches in your time of playing games, then this is going to raise the bar a bit higher.
3804	1	a	A very good game. Way better than Call of Duty and Battlefield.
1678	1	a	hard to say need more time with the game to say if its good or bad
2435	1	a	If you liked ARMA 2, then you will love ARMA 3!  Because it is ARMA 2, with better graphics and less content. I bought it, so should you.  10/10, will have to create your own game to enjoy the game you just bought.
832	1	a	Really Good Game  Enjoy every single Part Of It   Really good mods commountes
1665	1	a	-begins to play Wasteland with a friend -spawns in a town -we get gear and a vehicle -we start driving towards a populated area -night time strikes -we see movement near a gunstore -we get out the car and start running towards the store -can't see crap but yolo -realize they have a tank -we start getting bombed -we run back -we hide near a wall -tank starts roaming around the wall trying to find us -tank comes inches away from our faces -tank starts to shoot randomly -we scared -we survive -another guy ventures around the wall -a bullet goes through my ***hole -my buddy looks behind and kills him -tank is still shooting randomly  10/10 wtf was that tank doing
208	1	a	Better than Arma2, but i miss the old Arma felling.
2034	1	a	Note\'s:  No screaming kids. Check No aim assist. Check Easy mod support. Check Great and healthy community. Check  In this game you can live out your life doing hardcore drugs. Go into a giant battle royal. Or â¥â¥â¥â¥ some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥es up!  a must buy on sale. BUY IT!
691	1	a	Great game, however the APEX dlc is WAAAAAAY TOO â¥â¥â¥â¥ING PRICEY. $.$
5199	0	a	This game is one of the greatest multiplayer experience i ever had in a video game. Except one thing:  Performance of the game in multiplayer. It is terrible, no matter what your specs are, prepare to face 25-40 fps all the time in multiplayer. I'm glad that developer supporting this game through patches, dlc etc. But i simply cannot enjoy a game when framerate is all over the place. Low framerate=biger input lag, in a game when every second matters, it is unnaceptable.   Besides bad performance, it's a great milsim, with focus on teamwork, tactics etc.
2483	1	a	ARMA III is not a love hate relationship, it is a relation comprised of ruthless, and merciless defeat and frustration. This game made me pour hundreds of hours of my life, into a virtual world, where i only die. I could not recommend this more to someone who wishes to experience what it's like to be a complete failure. Playing arma, is like when you swap from COD to Battlefield, except you are being constantly reminded, that you are vulnerable. 10/10, would bearing 000000
4419	1	a	Arma 3 Is a Game like no other, Bohemia Interactive is a one of a kind company aswell! They Treat their Customers with Respect they listen to their fanbase and They dont rip us off infact they let us rip them off lol! But the Arma Series Is amazing And Arma 3 the latest installment is No Acception when Compared to Arma 2 Or Arma 1 This game is just amazing anyone that is looking for a Hardcore Military Simulator Based on the future of warfare (2035ish) The core game is Perfect for you! But since Bohemia Interactive and this games Fanbase are amazing you have thousands of mods at your disposale Arma 2 Combined Operations ( Last Arma with DLC Operation Arrowhead) had mods witch enabled you to expierence the games simulation in WW2 Battles or Vietnamn or the ever now popular DAYZ (Zombie Appoycolypse Survival Simulator pretty much lol) But the mods and the game Give you 100% Freedom to do what you want where you want when you want!
3655	1	a	This is one of the best simulator games I've ever played. There is so much to do including a single player story mode, an editor, loads of mods, and a ton of multiplayer gamemodes. I highly reccomend playing this game.
287	1	a	Haven't played much of the base game, but Altis life is addictive as hell and well worth the money.
1997	1	a	my arma 3 (p much just wasteland) experience thus far:  1. get ar 2. get landmines 3. set landmines on blind curve in highway 4. loot poor brasilian pubbie that hits it 5. hide in woods, camp wreck 6. shoot more brasilian pubbies 7. repeat
4688	1	a	i DONT LIKE WARFARE IN THIS GAME. SOUNDS WIERD RIGHT? well I prefer the altis life!  Update - what a stupid review, i actually now enjoy warfare and would say i am good at it, i have my own gang/clan on arma 3 now and everything with a lot of members who respect me and follow my orders.  Update 2.0 - that last uopdate sound slike i am 9, â¥â¥â¥â¥ my life...   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^GONNA KEEP ALL THIS FOR MY OWN AMUSEMENT IN THE FUTURE BUT I AM NOW GOING TO WRITE A REAL REVIEW^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   Pros-   - no litle kids - no aim assist - really good mod support - best community ever - insane realism - Beautiful graphics  Cons -   - big learning curve. Took me ages to know how to play properly.   Overall-  Great game, lovely looking with fab community but is very complex...+
2297	1	a	Loving them graphics. Great game
4183	1	a	Only played a few hours, still testing it but I would recommend this to anyone :)
4285	1	a	Even though I only get 15 FPS in a city/town and 30 FPS in the countryside on this game, I still think it is one of the best games I have played. It still has some work to be done to it but thats just what the series is like, a bit glitchy. Some of the good points are 290km map with no limits, its a sandbox so you can do whatever the hell you want and a quite good campaign (well, thats what I think). Some of the bad points are that it is quite boring for some people. It can run pretty well on PC's without having a very good Graphics card. (I have a AMD Radeon 7730m 2GB graphics card and a i7 Core in a laptop and i can run the game!) This is one of my favorite games from one of my favorite series and I am glad I brought it.  9/10  If you like sort-of realistic first person shooters, then I would recomend you get this game.
358	0	a	Glitchy. Its been out for a long time and I finally got it but I'm not into it at all. Love flying helicopters but maybe 20 minutes or so in, the flight stick is suddenly unrecognized and I have to restart. Its infuriating. Added to a whole other mess of glitches and lackluster multiplayer (for me anyway) and frustrating single player. I'll rate it a meh. I'll be hated for it, but that's okay.
2332	1	a	Very good game. The campaign is a large step up from Arma 2 being both interesting, enjoyable, somewhat challenging and free from annoying AI leaders and teammates. Multiplayer is varied with both casual servers and clan servers with large battles occuring. The maps are both beautiful and varied, it is also a good template for mission makers. The main part of Arma III, however is the mods and missions created by the community, this is what Arma is all about. User created missions vary from single player stealth mission to large battles from land and air, there are even some more creative mission that allow you to become other things like a police officer. BIS have given the community an enjoyable game which doubles up as a template for a large amount of mods and missions both new and old. There are however some problem namely the optimisation. The is very laggy, there is however some solutions and after a bit of tweaking the game should be very playable. Squad management is still time comsuming but after some practice (from the campaign) it does become slightly easier. Overall Arma III is an excellent game and has set out on what it was going to achieve: Become an interesting and enjoyable game while allowing the community to create excellent mods and missions. Dont listen to people complaining about optimisation and content because optimisation can be solved with a google search and content can easily be fleshed out by those who have excellently contributed to the game on things such as the workshop and Armaholic. This game is worth every penny. 
2456	1	a	I've had tons of fun in this game already and I'm far from done. Singleplayer can sometimes be a hassle. I've come across a bunch of issues in missions forcing me to restart them, but I suppose that goes for every advanced simulator.  If you're playing with friends you'll never get bored. Any sandbox gamemode will do. Wasteland, Altis Life, Invade &amp; Annex and so on...  This game does require an above average gaming computer.
580	1	a	Edit: Serious Review  This game is currently the best sandbox military simulator  Pros - Amazing graphics - Amazing gameplay - Supports mods, Which is all about this game, Modders does great stuff - Great fun with friends - Constantly being updated  Cons - Desync issues - Lag issues when there's alot of people in one server
1207	1	a	ARMA 3 has been a constantly evolving game. Definitely worth checking out now that it's a more refined experience, has tons of incredible user created scenarios, a lot of variety online, and finally, the first part of the campaign is available. This has been the most fun I've had in a shooter all year, and I expect to continue enjoying it for years to come.
4624	1	a	Good game, much game mode.
5177	0	a	When it can hold 60 fps like dayz can now ill make a positive review.  PC - intel i7 16 gb ram and a gtx 980 20-40 fps in not acceptable...
25	1	a	Old but amazing!  Still an awesome game and addictive playing multiplayer. Highly recommend this if you're into real time strategy games.
3761	1	a	You're either going to tear your hair out, or be hooked in the first half hour.
5061	1	a	Arma 3, the continuation of the series by Bohemia. New players will love it, old players will love it. At the end of the day, it is still Arma, and it will still make you frustrated. But when it goes right, it's worth it. Even if it only goes right once.
2741	1	a	got to play the game for a while.... it was great, until it started to crash like five minutes after i got into a game. still havent found a solution to it and would love if someone inboxed me on how to fix it please
5201	0	a	So the majority of players populate RPG servers like Atlis Life instead of servers that host military maps such as CTi Warfare. That is proof enough that the game is a massive failure for what it is intended.   IMO the failure is down to lack of content first and foremost. Lack of guns, lack of everything , not even a BRDM ATGM or 'futuristic' equivilent that I feel is essential for any battlefield.... just one example, nevermind the rest of the stuff that is missing.   Oh, and charging relativelty big money for two helicopters and a flight model that nobody even asked for... Ridiculous. Operation Arrowhead/Resistance etc... cost just a little more and had massive content.   People bleat on (especially the stepford wives on the BIS forums) about 'supporting the devs' and buy the overpriced DLC. I bought the game therefore I am supporting the devs. If you want more money from me then release an OA style addon and not low content DLC BS.   What in gods name have the devs been doing all this time if these simple DLC packs are all they have to release? Every game since CWC has a major addon released within a year give or take a few months..... except Arma 3  And the weapon sway... By all means make the shooting mechanics unique and difficult to master (I dont want a COD clone here) But when I play, I like to play CTI maps. That includes killing vast amounts of infantry. Before it was no problem. Now I have to play a stupid minigame everytime I want to line up my sights with a target meaning the game is impossibly long and infuriating. There is not even a server setting to customise the game for a particular game mode. WTF is that about? If you just put that in then that would make it a whole lot less tiresome for a lot of people.   I had high hopes for the game when I bought it but I just cannot recommend it. Buy Arma 2 and all the addons for very cheap and just play that. Arma 2 is a vastly superior game and that makes me very sad indeed.
4651	1	a	With all the different multiplayer modes and missions, plus custom made scenario missions from the workshop, this game never get's old. It is a great game for hardcore players. The game is gorgeous. Especially at night. I paid full price for this game and never regretted it. If you see it on sale, it is a must have for military fps fans.
1601	1	a	I was playing takistan life everyone screamed allah akbar then i saw a car crash and blow up into spawn 10/10 Ign
721	1	a	Great game
2384	1	a	This game is really fun to play with friends.
1810	1	a	A good Arma player knows how to use the many features (glitches) to their advantage...
1890	1	a	Great game. It can be buggy but what can you expect for a game of this magnatude? 8.5/10
1418	1	a	Best game I have ever played
1326	1	a	Flying cars get stuck mid-air, 11/10
1244	1	a	Went to a weed field to gather some cannabis and got arrested by undercover cops.  10/10 would sell weed again. 
3152	1	a	Realistic, Fun, and easy to play when you know simulators. 10/10 
2665	1	a	id have to say this is money well spent
4514	1	a	My rig could barely hold 20fps so i ran around in wasteland shot some people drove a guys car full of stuff off a cliff.  10/10 would run around again.
5027	1	a	I may not have even played 10 hours of this game at the time I am writing this review but  THIS GAME IS SPLENDID.
1754	1	a	Highly recommend!
1082	1	a	This game is bloody spectacular though one issue I have is the fact that with an i5 6500, GTX 1060 and 8GB of RAM I can't push above 60fps at all times and lowering settings does not change anything, I assume this to be a CPU bottleneck due to it having to render a very large map. Anyway game is great no matter what but hopefully in the future there will be a patch to further optimise performance.
5225	1	a	Recomend playing. Driving Meh
4790	1	a	It is a lot of fun if you have friends to play with. 
2684	1	a	PROS  This is a very indepth game for thos who love role play, and the adrenaline rush of battle that comes from an lmg supressing you behind that one rock. The feeling that one bullet can literally take your life a way, a commanding a squad or even an army, with a rich modding community to keep your interest peaked this is a very fun game.  CONS  Now i cant stress enough, this is no console game, no call of duty, no battle field. A well thought out but sloppily put togetehr Battle simulator. You will find yourself forgetting the controls unless you play faithfully everyday. You will be imersed in this game but trust me you will know its a game, you cant evem jump in this game but i t didnt stop my purchase.  Its awe inspiring and overall a very good game where they lack in proper control scheme and polish they make up for with dumping content and realism in your face.
1510	1	a	What can I say? I've been with Bohemia Interactive since 2001 when Operation Flashpoint was born. If you think Day Z or Arma has been laggy, how do you think I felt when I played OFP on a P4 800 Mhz processor with a 1 GB of RAM? Since the release of the latest update, the long awaited 'fire your weapons from vehicles' has emerged and Arma 3 has moved one step closer towards it's completion.   As for the DLC, first it was karts, then helicopters. The next installment is scheduled for Q1 of 2015 that will feature an enhancement for marksmen.   But, that does not go without saying that Arma 3 will ever see a final update, for the game is very community oriented and new improvements are found each and every day.  If you are a fan of any sort of realistic gameplay regarding war or vehicle physics, then Arma 3 is for you. Nothing excites me more than loading up a Blackhawk to it's gills and entering a combat zone with my friends and other real players only to delve out utter mayhem and destruction to our enemy.   Arma 3 is my favorite game, and if you give it a chance and are patient with it's occasional shortcomings, then get on board and let's annihilate some targets!
2434	1	a	fantastic game love every minute of it.
3591	1	a	No matter if you are a modder, mapmaker with no advance tool knowledge, shooter, taker, air head, rts player, mission maker, or explorer; this game is for you.
3464	1	a	I waited to play this after release because of some issues and not having any friends to play it with, I started playing it now a couple days ago and it is fantastic. The mods available for the game give unlimited content. Best shooter out atm imo.
4121	1	a	I mean you get what you buy, it's arma, it runs like â¥â¥â¥â¥, the ai suck, the physics make no sence but it's glorious, ACE3 will make me continue to take math in highschool and i could never afford G3s or air frames in real life.
2528	1	a	Hello, I'm a noop, So far I'm the bootcamp is giving me a headache. I'm trying to figure out how to figure out bearings and how to should my weapon if any one would like to help it would be appreciated. Have fun   Hiker1952
5206	0	a	worst arma game in history. it feels more like COD or Battlefield due to when you run you can see your wepon on the screen. the graphics are amazing but the graphics dont make the game. the realism is there due to the new stamina system and in vehicles you need more than one person to make it effective but they really didn't do what they promised like putting the take on helicopters flight model in so the helis feel like VTOL planes when you fly really fast. i also dont like how it is set in the future because it cant be a simulation if it is in a era we have no clue about. and the weapons sound like your firing marsh mellows at people the 50. cal machine gun on the pickup trucks sound so quite when i fire a mounted gun i want to have the feeling that im shooting a 27mm gun with my hands not that im just firing another LMG. finally the NATO forces dont have any jets in the vanilla game but the OPFOR and indpendents do it should be the other way around and also the lack of planes, helis and IFVs is terrible there should be more IFVs than tanks and thats not the case, if i want to take a patrol out im not going to take 2 MBTs and a IFV im more likely to take a MBT and 2 IFVs im patroling not trying to take an airbase. those are the reasons you should not waste 60 dollers on arma 3.
5073	1	a	In this game you have everything, role-play, open world survival, battle royale, TDM, Co op etc. Makes me come back to it all the time.
4997	1	a	Beautiful graphics, massive scale (terrain is huge and PLENTY of weapons and vehicles to use). The game has a growing mod support, gametypes like Wastland, Battle Royale, King of the Hill and Domination gives the game a big lifespan, where boredom is a hard thing to find. The requirements are a bit demanding, but with an old phenom processor and GTX 660, I run the game fine.
1689	1	a	Best game ever you can run ultra and get over 60 fps if you have a good enough pc. i have a  8gb ram GeForce 760 winows 10 and amd quad core 4.00 ghz and i can run at a minimum of 100fps on very high
5326	0	a	Not worth the price. Not even close. Do not buy this game. Especially if you don't have an organized group to play with.
4226	1	a	very good i think yes :)
5084	1	a	Nothing beats playing multiplayer to see a giant exloding rocket peniz flying around in the air.
2507	1	a	Hours on the editor, learning from the showcases this game is truly a sandbox experience. Better interface and controls make this Arma compelling to anyone.
2988	1	a	Its arma 3 buy it
810	1	a	This game gets a bit repetative after a while, but is still fun to play when you got nothing else to do.
2672	1	a	Perfect !
2666	1	a	Arma3 Is a must buy. Period.
2067	1	a	When you play this game you will be in a serious fire fight, Taking orders from your squad leader to provide suppressive fire or something while staying out of fire of an LAV, A friendly transport heli flys over head, it tells your squad leader he needs to get rid of that LAV before the heli can land, So he tells his AT specialist tofire a rocket at that LAV.... Apparently for some reason that LAV explodes and it is sent into the air, It becomes the perfect AA weapon, Instantly taking out the Heli and leaving you to over whelmed by hoards of sharp shooting AI.  10/10
2172	1	a	Amazing game - not worth $60, 3 years after release - let alone the rediculous â¥â¥â¥â¥ing DLC prices and business practices. The game is still horribly optimized - and has been since the beta, so I call â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t on the System Requirements - of which I surpass by a long shot; But the game struggles to maintain a steady framerate above 30 on a Quad Core Skylake Processor in multiplayer. What annoys me more are the bugs that have been unaddressed since beta, but the Devs are too busy 'reanimating the idle stance' and adding new gun sounds.  That's not to say that the game itself isn't great - This is really the closest you can get to the real thing - and if you get on a realism based server, you'll be sitting bored as â¥â¥â¥â¥ for hours, then have an action and adrenaline packed 5 minute firefight, just like the real deal.  We don't jump from Jets going 400 knots, snipe an enemy chopper pilot and his gunner, then strap C4 to said Jet, hop back in mid-air and fly it into a tank like the Battlefield 4 kiddies would like you to believe. This is as close as you can get without really experiencing the suck. There are also tons, and tons of mods to choose from that further enhance the experience as well as A3 Exile or DayZ Epoch. The flying and vehicle combat is extremely satisfying as well. I would say get this in a sale - or on â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, the DLC is more reasonably priced on â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ as well. There are a lot of games out there that I would say are better deals for less money than this game. But if you're willing to shell out the money, and have a beast computer, then by all means go for it. (Steam censors â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ for some reason, greedy â¥â¥â¥â¥ers.)
3013	1	a	Bought the game 4 hours before the discount doubled. Still a great game. I rate in 3 Half Lifes out of 3
1898	1	a	This game is truly awesome..
1216	1	a	I think this game is a great military sim.It combines teamwork with tactics and mixes it up with mods and good bots that will give you a run for your money.Now ive only played this for the free weekend so I cant give you a super good reveiw but I will say that from what me and my brother played that this game is vary fun and challenging game and we will definetly buy it in the upcomeing days
970	1	a	This game has a lot of potential. Can't wait to see what becomes of it through the community.
1540	1	a	nvm this game is pretty cool with friends
4740	1	a	Amazing game. hours of fun played on this and many more to come.
266	1	a	Adolf Hitler (German: [ËadÉlf ËhÉªtlÉ]; 20 April 1889 â 30 April 1945) was an Austrian-born German politician and the leader of the Nazi Party (German: Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP); National Socialist German Workers Party). He was chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945 and dictator of Nazi Germany (as FÃ¼hrer und Reichskanzler) from 1934 to 1945. Hitler was at the centre of Nazi Germany, World War II in Europe, and the Holocaust.  Hitler was a decorated veteran of World War I. He joined the German Workers' Party (precursor of the NSDAP) in 1919, and became leader of the NSDAP in 1921. In 1923, he attempted a coup in Munich to seize power. The failed coup resulted in Hitler's imprisonment, during which time he wrote his memoir, Mein Kampf (My Struggle). After his release in 1924, Hitler gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles and promoting Pan-Germanism, antisemitism, and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. Hitler frequently denounced international capitalism and communism as being part of a Jewish conspiracy.  Hitler's Nazi Party became the largest elected party in the German Reichstag, leading to his appointment as chancellor in 1933. Following fresh elections won by his coalition, the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act, which began the process of transforming the Weimar Republic into the Third Reich, a single-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of National Socialism. Hitler aimed to eliminate Jews from Germany and establish a New Order to counter what he saw as the injustice of the post-World War I international order dominated by Britain and France. His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the Great Depression, the denunciation of restrictions imposed on Germany after World War I, and the annexation of territories that were home to millions of ethnic Germans, actions which gave him significant popular support.  Hitler actively sought Lebensraum ('living space') for the German people. His aggressive foreign policy is considered to be the primary cause of the outbreak of World War II in Europe. He directed large-scale rearmament and on 1 September 1939 invaded Poland, resulting in British and French declarations of war on Germany. In June 1941, Hitler ordered an invasion of the Soviet Union. By the end of 1941 German forces and their European allies occupied most of Europe and North Africa. Failure to defeat the Soviets and the entry of the United States into the war forced Germany onto the defensive and it suffered a series of escalating defeats. In the final days of the war, during the Battle of Berlin in 1945, Hitler married his long-time lover, Eva Braun. On 30 April 1945, less than two days later, the two committed suicide to avoid capture by the Red Army, and their corpses were burned. Under Hitler's leadership and racially motivated ideology, the regime was responsible for the genocide of at least 5.5 million Jews, and millions of other victims whom he and his followers deemed racially inferior.
870	1	a	10/10, Great game and a great mods for it
1441	1	a	Its Ok, Not spent much time on it though.
2824	1	a	Very good game 10/10 would kill again
1280	0	a	i dont know how to get in to severs it kicks me out all the time why ?? 
5277	1	a	Great Game, 9/11
1165	1	a	ArmA 3, the most universal shooter you might ever need to own. Back in the old days, it was half life which everyone had to own, because this piece had plenty of content which you were able to play in so many different ways that itÂ´s almost impossible to count them all. And ArmA nower days is pretty much the same, even if youÂ´re not a fan of great and realistic combat simulations it offers massive free content via itÂ´s big community which wonÂ´t stop generating content until and after the next ArmA will be released.   But be aware this game is a hefty performance eater and it can cause you alot of headache, because of itÂ´s bugs. But I have no doubt right now, that most of the bugs are wiped out and the rest is still on itÂ´s way to be fixed. Because this game really getÂ´s the love of itÂ´s makers after itÂ´s final release. Theres still an Addon to be awaited as well as a very nice DLC and IÂ´m positively looking forward to it.
3125	1	a	Arma 3 what is there to do?  There is many things you can do on Arma 3, here is just a quick list of things you can do and get...  1. There are role-playing servers 2. Wasteland servers where everyone fights to the death 3. There is a ton of mods you can get for this game  4. A lot of friendly people 5. Can make your own server for free!!  6. Not a lot of hackers because this game has top scripters who prevent them  So there was a quick list of things you can do and get.   Do I recommend this game?  Yes I do because this game is top knotch it has incredible views, two big maps. fun game modes you can play, and tons of mods!  Here is how you can create a server for free:  http://youtu.be/E3ubmiGdPVs   Thank you for viewing this review!
1253	1	a	Diz gime is bes gam eber cuz it haz grapix and if you pres v button you dance. but lots of haxerz i prezed alt f4 and dey haxd my game annd make me quite the game!!
1973	1	a	Uhh... Go to heroin fields for muney.
755	1	a	This game is very well done. It is about as close as you can get to total realism in a game. This is also somewhat a downside though. It makes missions being done by yourself without any AI or player assistance very difficult. But if you have a group of friends to help you take on some of the missions, you will enjoy this game. The multiplayer is awesome. Before I found this game, I had always been searching for a game with a gamemode that has teams with about 65 players or so each all fighting over one point. The workshop feature makes the game even better, being able to download new missions whenever you finish the ones you already have. This is overall a pretty cool game.
1674	1	a	One of the better FPS games on the market.A must have game.Better than Call of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s and Battlefield. 10/10
3291	1	a	this game is worth buying. it has good graphics... i dont even have to mention anything everythings awesome with it
3120	1	a	 Bottom line:   Necessary investment
716	1	a	Arma 3 has something that I don't. That something is tranquility.  Loose your gear? I Loose my sh*t.
2506	1	a	1000000000000/10  By far one of the best games I've ever played. There is just so much you can do in this game. Wasteland, King of the hill, Invade and annex, altis life and those are just a few of the game modes not counting all the mods this game supports. And the graphics of this game are so realistic and stunning they can be compared to that of real life graphics on ultra settings. This game captures every detail of modern-somewhat futuristic warfare from the mechanics of flying a helicopter to bombing an area with mortors. And if you stuggle with flying choppers or jets or just need to practice your close quarters combat they have an editor mode which can serve as training help. This is probably my favorite game right now and i reccomend it to anyone with a good stable computer.
2317	1	a	Very Fun. I would recommend this game to multiple people.
2525	1	a	Love this game, the variation with the various mods is great...
5375	1	a	Fun game. Really fun for mucking around or just surviving online. Huge map. Great with mods (zombie survival mods such as Zoombies). Must play shooter.
5421	1	a	-Awesome Graphic -Great Military simulation -Have many mode  worth to buy 10/10
3820	1	a	if you like tactical , military or stategy games, purchase it you damn â¥â¥â¥!!! The only thing that i didnt like it , was that the servers sometimes are scrap ;p
1975	1	a	Action packed and super fun at times! :) A good pc is recomended.
282	1	a	Bullets actually hurt you. 10/10
1481	1	a	For a Military Game/Sim this is looking second to none. Huge Enviroment mixed with almost limitless posibilities. From a modding point of view this game is INSANE. Not only does it have an intuitive Editor but also a dedicated community providing a stream of free content which is now managed via the workshop part of steam. a must have for any Immersive/RPG gamer.   Next Stop Altis.
272	1	a	a more realistic battlefield/cod when you play modes like wasteland or king of the hill; can also be fun if you play the dayz mod for free; battle royal, do I need to say more? get dropped on an island with 30 other people, find a weapon and 'survival of the fittest'!; if you're the roleplaying person, who likes to deal drugs, have â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s (women, who sell their bodies to greasy guys) or just be a corrupt cop, then altis life is just the right thing for you!  so in general, this game offers are great variety of mods, it's very own realism and it's not full of garbage kiddies, who flame and pretend to have made love with your mother (like the cod-fanboys, lel)  10/10 would buy again
3044	1	a	Its a nice game specialy when they did arma 3 dayz mod prob lots of players should join
886	1	a	ARMA  that is all
3231	1	a	Want a game you can play for years and have no limits to what can be done with this game? 275 hrs and counting and I still find new stuff to do all the time. Only cons are as always with arma, optimization blows. But quite honestly, I probably would've paid $200 if that's what they charged, it's that good.
3131	1	a	11/10
5416	0	a	*slow clap* nice way to go all EA on us and wait to release half the end game content in dlc, get aggressive cancer bohemia devs.
2082	1	a	as my computer starts to weep i start up arma 3 .... my i5 4670 and R9 390 powerless to help and i realise that 15 fps is indeed playable !!!
2464	1	a	Nice game, controlls are a bit â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up but you get used to it :D
1039	1	a	this game is everything ive been looking for! been playing nothing but King Of The Hill - but there is so much more to the game I just haven't gotten into the rest of it. many many mods and custom scenaros availble - a very community driven game.  the perfect mix, counterstrike meets battlefield meets call of duty, but very different from all three games, set in a very large open free world with the realism level pretty high. it's a war simulation, so you have to be patient and tactical. if you're running around in the open you will get picked off. if you crash into a tree while you are driving a small vechicle at high speed you will die.   very rewarding game once you get good. you need teamwork and fluid communication. get a headset. get ready to die 25 times before your first kill, and be ready to have no idea where you got shot from :D take cover and keep your eyes open for movement.   a few bugs and glitches here and there but doesn't take away from the game. some issues climbing stairs, weird choppy moments trying to climb over certain objects, noticed a few wall issues too.  very happy with this game so far i hope they keep polishing it   edit: best game i ever played in my life
2909	1	a	10/10
2194	1	a	The best game in the world
3481	1	a	10:10
3647	1	a	Best military simulation game out there. Great sandbox with incredible modability and community support. You will find no other game with the same amout of teamplay and immerssion. It suffers from bad performance, occassional bugs, silly physics and semi-acceptable DLC policy.  Strives when played with an organized group. With support of many advanced modifications it shows its full potential.
2791	1	a	Great game it is the most realistic game i have played. The bullet mechanics are amazing such as you can only penetrate through an amount or a type of wall with types of guns as a sniper could go through 7 walls about but at that amount the bullet goes down a lot and makes it a quite horrible shot though can still lead to death. The helicopters are good as well so are the jets as helicopters can/may have flares which deviate from the jets lock on and will miss which is a good way to nerf the jet without actually nerfing it. Game has a lot of game modes and even game modes made by the players themselves which make it more fun E.G Altiz Life.  Though a thing that should be removed is the DLC as you need to pay to actually get the full game really. You want to snipe? That's an extra Â£7 you want more choppers that are better than the default? That will be an extra Â£7. Though there is an exception for one DLC that does not matter the go karts DLC as it is just there for people that would like it though the rest should be removed.  I would recommend this to people that like realistic games and not games that are just run and gun.
2100	1	a	Have you ever thought 'Man, being in the military sure does look fun, except for the danger, the hard work, and the PTSD'? Well look no further. Billy Mays (rip in piece) here with a new fantastic product. Talking about the ArmA III! Insurgents got you suppressed? Call in close air support, and show those silly Altisians the meaning of freedom. Iranian forces setting up checkpoints all over? Send your rebel minions in, and call in an airstrike! Call now, and get your very own laser designator, complete with the highest level of authorization for drone stikes! Dont wait, call today!
1521	1	a	this game is the best military simulator ive ever played
1513	1	a	It's worth &lt;#
1702	1	a	It's very good game for me, it's supporting mods and more stuff, there is so much new people to meet, but DLC's... DLC's are good but that can't be like that you need to buy everything to get access to it So I'll give that game solid 9.5/10
3732	1	a	If you don't already own this game I'm disapointed.. It's a pretty awsome game with various stuff to do, check it out!!!
3848	1	a	Fun and intense as â¥â¥â¥â¥. This realistic shooter will have you on the edge of your seat in the compaign and in multiplayer (which is hype AS â¥â¥â¥â¥). The RP server are pretty cool too, its always a plus to have functional RP servers in games.
2233	1	a	Very good simulation game.
1897	1	a	The best game I ever played
3440	1	a	i love arma 3 buy it buy it buy it
4303	1	a	best game. cause theres no other words to describe this.
3778	1	a	Simply the best close to realistic shooter you are going to play. So many different mods that are great and frustrating but brilliant. So many hours wasted, I mean used, playing zombie type mods and KOH. Love it! :D
1224	1	a	Good Realistic war game, BIg map, just buy it
919	1	a	Vastly improved in movement, combat, and functionality, ArmA 3 is a big improvement graphically and gameplay wise. The content inside although, is nowhere to be seen. It's still a pretty barren game, with only 1 episode of the campaign. But it is still very fun, and I do reccomend it to fans of the ArmA series and even newcomers. Just wait for the modding community to fix most of the problems.
557	1	a	This game Is very fun and awesome. The graphics are insanely good, The attachment and clothing system is very cool, And this game is just plain out awesome. I'd recommend it to those who are fans of ARMA II or Military Simulators. Overall rating of this game for me is a 10/10.
3269	1	a	10/10
5166	0	a	not recommended just buy a BF3 or BF4 you will enjoy for long long looong time.
2077	1	a	great game
5071	1	a	I hold a gun for the first time. 10 out of 10 game.
1364	1	a	it's a cool strategic game if you find the right players and mods...it can go a far way when communitys get there hands on you.
3053	1	a	Shot a Go Kart with a sniper Rifle and it took out a city block.   11/10
1954	1	a	  Good and realy fun I like the campaign but I like the multiplayer more Its one of the most realistic miletery game ever
801	1	a	its fun to play if ur into tactical fps
4818	1	a	Goes great with the Breaking Point mod! Way better then DayZ!  Edit: seems Exild Mod is pretty fun as well!
4219	1	a	I have Autism and I recommend this game.
253	1	a	Download enough mods and it starts to get good again.
453	1	a	This game is DOPE!
743	1	a	the controls are still â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up. Didnt you learn anything from previous Armas
5347	0	a	i thought sunday was a weekend day.
4284	1	a	The vanilla, unmodded game is honestly pretty awful. It is nothing like A2, where I could still play Vanilla for hours on end. ArmA 3 just feels weird compared to the games that came before it, and the lack of familiar weaponry because BIS was too cheap to buy the licenses is terrible.   On the other hand, throw some mods on, and play MilSim and you have one of the best games created. It is just a shame that weapons mods, vehicle mods and countless others are still required for good gameplay, when BIS could easily integrate them into the core game and do away with the need.
3104	1	a	IMO this game it so cool, i can be a soldier without joining a military. but this game it's so expensive ;-;
3368	1	a	its a game on steam 11/4
2272	1	a	In brief: - If you're an Arma enthusiast, Arma 3 is a _must_! - If you don't know the Arma series, this game is a MUST :) !  Infantry simulator, with the ability to drive vehicles (Land, Air, Sea) with high degree of fidelity and real simulation. Physics, gameplay, story (for single players), graphics. The game is just awesome.  Warning: if you're picky (might commit suicide on the first pseudo-bug encountered) or you like FPS action, John-Wayne-style, this IS NOT for you. This is more a simulator than a shoot-em-up game, where tactics, speed of wit and experience play an invaluable role in the missions. And sometimes, things don't behave as expected... But rarely... But it happens...  However, if you like to zero up/down your sniper scope to compensate for the distance, if it makes you happy to carry a couple of weapons in your backpack, your magazines in your bandolier and night vision goggles on your combat helmet, if it matters for you to enter a vehicle and find most of the internals working (like speed/fuel/RPM gauges, mirrors, screens...), if you like UAV's and small drones that fit in your backpack, if you like to select your ammo type (tracer, belt, regular mag), if you find it awesome to play in an environment with kilometers of view-distance, if it engages you to play a game where there is no health bar, but every bullet counts (both the ones you deliver or receive), if you like to customize the game and create your own scenarios and campaigns and play them with your friends, if you like to play Zeus (yup, the Greek God, with the Lightning bolt)... If... If... If all (or most) of the above apply to you, well, this game is for you.  This is one of the games I can't recommend enough.
1693	1	a	This game contains best parts of every shooter and RTS I played. You can succeed without having very good reaction or something else like that, and in fact it's usually better to be tactical and come up with a plan other than 'Run and gun the enemy down.' Also, as of Pre-Apex the DLCs aren't really neccesary to enjoy the game.
1029	1	a	The most realistic war simulator ever made. I won't give it a 10/10 because of its bad support for old graphics cards.    9/10
470	1	a	It's Awesome!!! 
1474	1	a	Can be awesome if you can get ahold of some of the great mods AND a good group of folks to play MP with. Other than that, you probably won't have much fun.   I've been playing ARMA titles since Operation Flashpoint came out.
3406	1	a	Great game : Nice graphic  Open world Fun playing with friends :D  P.S  i wish there are armory mode like arma 2  Also hope there will be more map coming soon :D
3109	1	a	Best army/game ever to date! If you have not got it yet, go get it now!
5136	1	a	Although many fans of the ARMA series have been critical of certain aspects of this game(such as the choice to make it based in the future) I would still highly recommend this game to any fan of FPS, RPG, or Strategy game types. The base game is basically FPS, but the modding community has expanded it's basic description to meet other gamers needs(Including my own). This game has a strong/loyal fan base, and has for years. If you don't try this game at some point you honestly haven't lived!
3067	1	a	  Played it with a friend and is worth all the money they ask for! so many gamemodes so big map so fun experience
198	1	a	The sheer number of Mods and missions available for this game is unbelievable. Great fun on the techie side too can be had hosting a server from GamingDeluxe
3136	1	a	if you want a game game where teamwork is the only solution to any problem, then look no further.
1423	1	a	Blow up a cop car full of cops, get arrested with a 180k load out, get detained by a police officer, jump out the car every time he gets in, make him get very pis sed off, get away with a 85k ticket and keep all your guns. 1000000 / 0.1 IGN 'Would pi ss off cops again' TwiisT 2016
3711	1	a	Great game when you have alot of time to put into it, would defenilty recommend it if you like tactical games.
1281	0	a	Keeps Crashing broke
1494	1	a	Arma 3 is a great open game with a lot of posibilities and things to do. Game modes such as Altis Life or Wasteland are fun yet challenging, but can also be quite frustrating. The servers always have a great staff to help out in case you need to report someone or just need help with the server.
3029	1	a	very good five out of 7 stars
4018	1	a	this game is awesome that is all!
5162	0	a	I love arma 2 but arma 3 is one of the worst games i have ever played. one of the reason i like arma 2 is the warfare game mode but there isint a good warfare mode in arma 3.
1850	1	a	Mass lag i mean complete frame lock up turned game from ultra to potatoe mode no fix changed back to ultra no fix look on internet for 30 mins no fix cry a little look on internet more is told to turn down audio quality turn down audio quality game fixed My graphics were not set to high. My audio settings were.  10/10 would hear game to good again.
1865	1	a	nice optimisation bohemia
2655	1	a	Great Game. Even better with friends. Best experience.
2396	1	a	Unparalleled realism.   Amazing graphics and sound that take advantage of higher end machines.  Gameplay so intricate and suspenseful - the only true war SIMULATOR.  The modding community shines, with great missions from specifc PvE sets, to PvP battles, to full on RPG's.   It might not be the most fast-paced shooter - but when a well cooridinated assault kicks in, the fireworks can make the most over-the-top blockbuster shooter sequences look like cartoons. The suspense of being killed with one shot, of not knowing whether or not you've been spottted, or trying to overwhlem an attacking or defending force provides tangible investment in your gameplay. The realism of the weapons, vehicles, and physics simply has no competition. If you want real, and NOT arcade, this is the ticket.  This game thrives when playing with other communicating humans, and therein provides a war game experience that is addictingly engaging and entirely unique to ArmA.
2153	1	a	A game that I've returned to countless times. Always amazed by how it surprises me
1334	1	a	best game ever played! is the best real life shooter game you can have!
2911	1	a	I have been playing Bohemia Interactive games since 2001, Operation Flashpoint. Spent large portion of my life with them I treat them as a part of it. This game is pinnacle of what Bohemia has already offered us and it will be further expanded, possibilites are limitless we should be very excited. I rate it 100/10, if you want realistic shooter for productive adults, this is the game for you.
5059	1	a	After the great Operation Flashpoint (Now Arma: Cold War Assault) the first two ArmAÂ´s where not THAT great, but still very good and I enjoyed playing them for a long time.  Arma 3 is my favourite part of the trilogy, thanks to a good and thrilling campaign (much better than CoD or BF) and the ArmA formula, that perfectly works now. AI does what you want, their aim is very good and they are very helpful. Enemy seeks cover and is a real threat, which makes the missions very thrilling. Like in the first three Rainbow Six or the first Ghost Recon.  The campaign feels very tense, like Operation Flashpoint or the Addon Resistance and I really enjoyed it.  The game runs perfect on my two year old PC and it is sure beautiful. The sound is also very good and the rifles donÂ´t sound like toyguns which adds to the war atmosphere. Voice acting is great too. The controls are a bit difficult to master at first if you havenÂ´t played the other games of the series, but you get there with a little practice.  The new item system is also very good and now you can quick and easy change weapons, put attachments on your rifle or grab some other gear.  Overall this game is one of my favourite games of all time and itÂ´s a true masterpiece and thanks to the community you have tons of content for free.   Get it and enjoy it! :-)   
335	0	a	REALISM? REALLY? (this review pertains to the campaign)  -Enemies you hit jump three feet in the air (pop! just to let you know you hit them) wtf?  -A running simulator often enough, but you are winded after running for 20-30 seconds. Really? Am I a soldier in this game or a lazy â¥â¥â¥ gamer? Don't remind me I am the latter please. -An interface so clunky (and barely explained in the prologue) you will find yourself googling how tos again and again. You really will feel like a lazy â¥â¥â¥ gamer who ended up in a military situation, well done.  -Gunfire sounds seem to come from the spot where the bullets landed, NOT where they were fired from.  -Passing enemy helicopters never seem to see you/call in a squad to engage you. -AI squadmates run off without you to engage the enemy despite having no ammo, while you are trying to loot bodies for anything useful. -AI squadmates often get tired if you haven't killed an enemy and grenade his â¥â¥â¥ from quite a distance. Which is nice, but after it happens a few times you realize you aren't learning anything. -The impromptu basecamp in the campaign mentioned it had an armory. Nice! Except command for some reason placed the armory outside of camp, on a table, like some peddler, and not inside the base where such assets would be actually safe.   I guess that was my problem, I expected realism.   To boot, the game has been around since June 25, 2013, and yet the campaign they developed goes from boring to running simulator to incredibly difficult, and is over very quickly.   It stands to reason I suppose, since from release they game has felt more like a massive modding toolset than a game released for playing. At least the old operation flashpoint shooters (though buggy, largely unmoddable and hard as hell) had a semblance of a campaign, and the ability to issue orders to your squadmates. Here you are along for the ride, frustrating in most cases, laughable for the rest.
911	1	a	Fantastic game with a mind blowing amount of customization and a great modding community. The game is a military sim and is quite true to the details. Though I will stress this game is very complex when it comes to the controls and customization. As of now there is no easy way to create a 'loadout' without coding in some nasty box of text. There is plans to fix this. But just be warned this game does require decent understanding of PC gaming due to mass amount of controls and options there is big leaning curve. But I would high recommend this game.
5175	0	a	The game is poorly optimized. I get around 45 fps on my potato pc in campaign but only 5 fps online for some reason. Moreover, you can barely play this game online without buying all the DLCs. Not only do you have to buy a 55 dollar game but have to buy all the DLCs totalling to 77 bucks. That's 130 bucks for this â¥â¥â¥â¥ game where you get destroyed by 9 year olds who've all had sex with your mum. The community is fine actually but some servers are cancerous and I forgot to mention that the game is a bit buggy as well. I'm not made of money nor my parents are rich af so I didn't get all the DLCs and got this game on sale. Even with sale, everything would've cost me about 90 bucks which is just way too expensive for this â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. This maybe a great game with strategic gameplay but not worth everything you're throwing into it. Also, when I see games like these who divide all their necessary game componets into DLCs and charge you 45 bucks for one of them, I feel ashamed to be a gamer. Arma 3 is no different than those pay to win games you get on your phone and â¥â¥â¥â¥.
1314	1	a	Very good game.. spacial Altis life mod :)
1832	1	a	I dont even have this game why can I write a review?
3122	1	a	Really good
5390	1	a	THE BEST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED IN MY LIFE !!!  If you are looking for a realistic game with the best developers that listen to there community, a community that is always active in any game mode you play, a modding community that is always making and updating new content for the game and a game that will stay in your heart forever this is what you are looking for. YOU WILL GET YOUR MONEYS WORTH OUT OF THIS GAME, and trust me I have over 1000 hours and looking forward to many more to enjoy.
788	1	a	just tried out this game, seems okey, but IÂ´ve just seen 5% of the game... still a lot to discover
5145	0	a	Dear Arma,   It's not you... It's me.  A popular positive review by [Fog]Snow elequiently said, 'Kids play Call Of Duty, Boys play Battlefield, Men play Arma.'   I am a man all day, doing manly things at my manly job, and when I come home I just want to be a boy.   I have no problem getting killed with a single bullet, dealing with bullet drop, limited amo, or stamina effects on aiming. I love all of those things, and those are the reasons I started this relationship. But you're high maintinance, I can't give you the time you require, and I don't have a big enough friend group for you to like me.  Yesterday:  4hrs - Play singleplayer to learn controls, loving the game so far.  0.5hrs - Jump into 'Quick Play' try to go into normal FPS game modes like catpure the flag. All but two game modes either told me it couldn't find a server, or that I didn't have the DLC. Seems odd to me.  0.5hrs - Playing 'Caputre the Island' spawned in the middle of the ocean. WTF!!? Some guy on mic says you need to install something which will make a carrier ship appear, so if you don't have that you just fall into the ocean and can't get to the helicopters. Hmm okay.  1hrs - Same game, spawning at the points that are on land. Me and about 15 people are all waiting on a heli to pick us up. Sigh... Bored... Oh look a heli, yay!  0.05hrs - Heli gets shot down in route to town, I bail the heli like a Jason Bourne bad @ss and go to deploy my parachute to fly in like a tiger ninja raining down bullet hell that could make a grown man cry... but I don't have a parachute. Splat!   0.5hrs - Profanity, inanimate objects accelerating accross the room at forces greater than or equal to gravity, anger at game, dissapointment in purchase, hope of reimbursement, worry about game time spent in single player, sadness at time lost, look at clock and it is past bed time, tired, work tomorrow.  I am a software engineer by day and spend a lot of time figuring out computer related things. Like a TV show watcher, I too like to unwind at the end of the day, but for me I get that in gaming.   No I'm not 60, I am in my 20's.  WORKING FOR FUN IS NOT FUN WHEN YOU JUST GOT DONE WORKING FOR 8 HOURS.  In conclusion, Arma I'm sure there is someone perfect out there for you...but it's not me. I really wanted us to work out, I truly did, but it wasn't meant to be. I hope we can still be friends....  ps. yes I tried other game modes as you can see from my play time, but I didn't have much success. One game I got in and 2 mins later got kicked, I wasn't using a mic, I was playing the objective so not sure what I did.  yes I know this is a strategic sim, not a fly out of a heli 007 game, I was really mad that I had to A) spawn and wait close to an hour for another heli, or B) quit, download software for the carrier and join back in  In that timespan I could have played 2 BF4 games and had loads of fun. I wish Battlefied was more tacticle, but I'll take it over Arma because I have more fun overall.
592	0	a	Cant get a single match to function. -.-
3597	1	a	I have played over 100+ hours and this is my favourite game off all time.  Like when i play Altis:  1) Go up to an ATM take out all your money 2) Go buy a car 3) Drive to the Gun Store (takes million year to drive) 4) Buy license and gun 5) Drive down to kaval again  6) get robbed 7) cops drive pass  8) loss you gun  10/10  Get this game
5055	1	a	Love this game
2477	1	a	Great game if you like big maps and roleplaying as a soldier. Great variety of what you can do.
2399	1	a	Best gaming experience in my hole life this game take gaming to a hole new level. absolutely amazing. controls are quite a problem first but you will get used to it in a day or 2. buy now!
4517	1	a	I used to have a job and friends. Now I have Arma.
4489	1	a	This is the most realistic game i've ever played. Everything from the cars, armored vehicles, helicopters and jets to the boats and combat, this game has it all! The controls are completely realistic to a certain point. The possibilies in this game are vast for a war-based shooter. You can customize how you look, how your guns look, even how your vehicle looks! I highly reccommend this game to anyone looking for some realism.
2546	1	a	This game is one of the best ive played its got ... let me think cause theres a lot. lots of online game modes map editor realistic things um yea its just fun over all. I recommend this game also yes it does have ZUEZ!!!!
1072	1	a	this game is for real gamers :)
2709	1	a	10/10  great game, extremely  customisable to your  gaming needs, great replay value.  highly recommended 
1930	1	a	This game leaves me speachless I always liked to call Arma 'Military Simulator' because it is the most realistic shooter and combined-arms game you will ever play (that is of course, until there is an arma 4)  This game is great for the serious and the least serious.... with workshop support for RP, mods, zombies, wastelands, Tactical operations and more......  FACT: this review can't even scratch the surface of how good Arma is........ You will just have to look around, maybe watch some videos, maybe buy the game..... But I don't have enough time to describe this, I NEED to get back to playing it......
1737	1	a	There is one thing by which i know a game is good. That is if i've spent 886 hours on it and still haven't beaten the campaign
4508	0	a	If you want a realistic multiplayer shooter Arma 3 might be a good game but the campaign is complete â¥â¥â¥â¥ the story is average the allied AI is complete â¥â¥â¥â¥ and makes some missions close to impossible cause they love to run strange ways into the enemy line of fire and they dont know how doors or stairs work the AI regularly drives over you or your troop members if you are not really really carefull I have never seen such a bad AI
2959	1	a	Yeah except due to other campaign glitches we cant even make it to part 2
1511	1	a	best milsim on the market
3061	1	a	10/10
5012	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ optimization.(gtx 780)
4655	1	a	Great game I will never get bored of it and there are endless scenarios that you can put yourself in to make the game more fun :)
5245	0	a	hard to start playing
4791	1	a	this game u get shot alot and you go argh but u keep playing cas it good when u drice car and go swimming. i lik cas you can drive really fast and stuff, in this gam eyou can t shoot anyone cas the y kill you fisrt lol
3563	1	a	Still absolutely worth it
5299	1	a	It's k.
2889	1	a	  The best Army games and best czech game.
2797	1	a	  i just play it for the mariokarts
4311	1	a	A very good simulation and game. So many things to! good buy if u like these sort of games!
299	1	a	So, I am changing this review after serious serious SERIOUS play time. To be honest, the full game doesn't offer much content, it does offer much better mechanics though, its very in-depth and can be fun for a long time. But after a while all the cool stuff fades away, and it begins to turn into a boring war sim. I love ArmA. It is my most played series aside from PAYDAY. But I feel like I can't love it anymore, in my opinion I give this game a 7 out of 10. Because the time I had with it was great. The unbiased opinion of this is a 9 out of 10. Because of how everything works together, the only problems is how bad the online is, you drop frames due to CONNECTION ISSUES. Thx bohemia, volvo pls fix. I say its worth 30 dollars
2856	1	a	brilant game , but its not good for king of the hill any more as there are hardly any servers
501	1	a	The only series that my mod folder is larger than the game.
3027	1	a	Great game ! its a must buy for everyone who has some time on their hands !
1191	1	a	Most imersive shooter I've ever played. Tons of mods and wonderfull gaming experience when you have a performant PC and good clan to play it with ;) Check out Black Legion  (http://www.black-legion.co.uk/)  to see what we do in Arma III ;)
1485	1	a	highly addictive with lots of content, worth every penny
5321	0	a	Very realistic, but doesn't run multiplayer at high frames.
4215	0	a	The worse Arma ever - cannot connect and play co-op with a friend. Always get a response on game invite 'Server is not responding.' when trying to connect and play with a friend. They are just ripping off people by taking so much money for the poor quality. That's so devastating and sad. Do not spend your money on this game. Buy something which works instead.
1196	1	a	The best realistic battlefield game ever!!
177	1	a	It's like 30 games in one. The mods and scenarios etc are amazing thanks to a great community!
3111	1	a	Arma 3 is the game that will leave you endlessly for hours on end fighting and just overall enjoying the scenery! Arma 3 is the next gen Military Simulator by Bohemia Interactive and features over 500+ Units,Aircraft,Vehicles and weapons and many more goodies ingame. Arma 3 is worth buying!
3133	1	a	 Arma 3 is one of the most advanced, cumbersome, fun and stunning games I've ever played
5289	1	a	first time playing got robbed and my kidney stolen 10/10
3957	1	a	THE BEST GAME IN THE WORLD :)))))
3928	1	a	Children play Call of Duty Boys play Battlefield Teens play CS:GO Men play ARMA People waste there â¥â¥â¥â¥ing lives in real war, and were trying to copy that.    OK LETS DO IT ;D
1360	1	a	This game is still a bit buggy since release but that's to be expected with such a large project. I have a lot of fun playing the campaign but the most fun comes out of the community made gametypes. I definitely reccomend this game!
840	1	a	The newest iteration of the ArmA milsim franchise, ArmA 3 is set in the near future on a set of Mediterranean Islands. The Single Player is by far the best I've seen in an ArmA game and that's only after playing the first part of a three part campaign. The movement and pacing in ArmA 3 is greatly improved in relation to ArmA 2 and the combat and AI are far above it's predecessor.
1251	1	a	whatever
2025	1	a	LIKE FIRST PERSON SHOOTER? BUY THIS GAME!  LIKE THIRD PERSON SHOOTER? BUY THIS GAME!  LIKE MULTIPLAYER SANDBOX, SURVIVAL, MODS, AND REALISTIC â¥â¥â¥â¥? BUY THIS GAME!  JUST â¥â¥â¥â¥ING BUY IT GODAMIT BEST $60 I SPET IN MY LIFE!   
663	1	a	This is what the military games should be!!! The best game i ever had. recommended: 10/10    Make Arma not War Respect from Hellas and from my friends!!!    Please i would like to ask you to put the Hellenic Flag in the game i love my country i love this game!!!  We are waiting for more you are the BEST!!!!!
4971	1	a	Amazing game! I've put over a 100 hours in this game mostly in the Editor and it still has me coming back for more. The mod support for this game is also freaking awesome with evrything I could ever ask for and more! The campainge isn't the best but the multiplayer is everything a tactical shooter should be.
2519	1	a	good game bought in the summer sale lots of cool mods 8/10
2905	1	a	10/10. The best shooter game, and one of the best sandbox games. Who needs call of duty when this game exists?
623	1	a	A great start into a new age of tactical gameplay.
65	1	a	Being an avid ArmA 2 Wasteland/DayZ player back in the day (about 1.5 years ago), I relished the thought of a new ArmA coming out. ArmA 2 was practically uknown until it's popularity was increased by DayZ. I found it interesting to jump into a BI (Bohemia Interactive) title that already had a steady fan-base behind it. Having been about a year since I purchased this game (launch) and over 100 hours of solid gameplay I feel that I can finally write a review that encompasses many of the aspects I have experienced within this game. Now I know what you're thinking: '$59.99?! This isn't even considered a triple A title! That's like... that's like the price of CoD: Ghosts!' Now, don't be intimidated by this price, for I can say that off the bat this game is worth a lot more than $59.99. From a value perspective, I found the price to be very reasonable based on the game's content nowadays.  Basically, ArmA is a series of hardcore military simulation; constantly reflecting real-world conditions into a video game. In ArmA 2, I feel that this was it's drawback, for there were certain scenarios where it was realistic to a point of frustration (breaking your leg on a 2 foot fall. It's a game guys, relax). ArmA 3 has found a good balance between an FPS/3rd Person shooter game and realism, making it extremely enjoyable as both a simulator   and   a game. I also found that ArmA 3 has very good support for newbies to the series and is able to really engage players into the fun. I imagine it is much easier to get into ArmA 3 than I did ArmA 2 (I can't judge, I'm not new to it).   The engine is decently optimized and is far less clunkier than the ArmA 2 engine, however rocks are still (and I guess forever will be) broken. Perhaps the game is having difficulty conforming such free player movement with an un-even surface.   Pro tip: NEVER WALK ON ROCKS UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.  The game also has a variety of content; although players coming over from 2 will notice that there are A LOT less guns. This is partly due to the customization of guns. Instead of having a separate gun for each gun variation (M4A1 HOLO, M4A1 CCO, M4A1) you have a base gun and you are able to add sights, lasers, silencers, flashlights, what have you. However, this is not a full excuse- I feel that there are still a lesser amount of overall GUNS to shoot. Perhaps Bohemia Interactive is trying to fine-tune each gun into the patches as opposed to adding a ton of mediocre weapons simply for variety's sake. What's also very surprisingly good in this game is the Nvidia PhysX that was incorporated. Seeing my transport truck's wheels constantly bumping up and down according to the land under me while I drive troops through the night is oh-so-satisfying as well as, well... realistic! The physics engine has been extremely improved and I quite like it.  I'd like to finally talk about how the guns shoot and how they sound, for this is after all, a big part of the game. Once again I will compare it to ArmA 2, in saying clearly that ArmA 2 featured a more high-pitched 'tappy' sound when you shot with vertical recoil, while 3 brings a much more deeper, louder shot as well as echo to accompany it as the gun travels backwards into your viewmodel as opposed to upwards. The guns definitely feel better for me, but in the end I'd like to classify this judgment as personal preference.  Lastly, the gamemodes of ArmA 3 are diverse and excellent, my favourite being Wasteland script. I won't go into detail here. There is also King of Hill, DayZ (OF COURSE, but it's MEH) and of course standard operations. Altis Life is also a really sweet one! Check those out if you end up buying.  So yeah, I really like this game and I think that there is so much potential for a growing community. Grab some buddies, hop into Stratis and keep overwatch with some snipers and riflers as you and your team move in through the bushes to grab an objective for more supplies for your squad! Really great game, I'd definitely recommend to any FPS/MILSIM fan! :D
2335	1	a	Great game. Great successor of the previous one. A must have for every military enthusiast!
1785	1	a	If you're into hyper-realistic shooters, this is as good as you're going to get.
3830	1	a	THIS IS A COMBAT SIMULATOR, NOT AN FPS! I cannot stress that enough. Having said that some of my most memorable gaming moments came from this game. I can remember moving through a town, we were so close to the objective, then an explosion. A guy in my squad had stepped on a mine, then came another, and one more after. The enemy opened fire and we had to dive for cover. My squad quickly attempted to return fire but it seemed we were pinned, and there were three of my buddies still laying wouded in the open. Unsure of their condition I charged forward grabbing the first guy and pulling him behind cover, then the second and soon after the third. Miraculously I wasn't hit by gunfire, but we had problem, our medic was one of the three wounded. Without a field medic to stabilize the wounded they would surely die. I called out over the comms for anyone who could help, there was a long pause...then a response, a pilot just happened to be dropping off a squad nearby and was happy to evac them to HQ. We eventually managed to drive the enemy off, allowing for medevac to pick up the wounded and fly them to safety.    It still sounds to me like something that would be scripted in a singleplayer campaign, something where you are surrounded by npcs and you are merely along for the ride, just for entertainment. The truth is, these were all real players, fighting as a team, trying to save three members of their squad. It's player interactions like that that make this game incredible.  TLDR: This game is awesome, I cannot reccomend it enough!
5307	1	a	The base game I would give 80/100.....with all the great mods people put together for it I would give it a 90/100. This is due to the fact some of the mods are still.....meh....to say the least. Great game overall and highly suggested to realistic shooter enthusiasts.
4259	1	a	I only play the multiplayer. Addictive and time consuming, but worth it. So many map and server style choices to choose from, its hard to stick to just one.
3352	1	a	Love it, Altis life rolling around with the clans always a good time when coppas stop a car filled to the top full of heroin XD
2638	1	a	Great game and wouldn't swap it for any other and I got a great community to back me up on that
601	1	a	This is one of those games you get because of the mods. The core game is nice, but the mods is what really makes it. Battle Royale, Arma 3 DayZ, Altis Life RPG, and many more things to do with this masterpiece military simulator. It's a big step up from Arma 2, however Arma 2 (inc. Operation Arrowhead) have a few more things this doesn't have (like Island Life). Great game overall.
731	1	a	i shot a fish in the face 
2970	1	a	Brilliant game. I only got it because of the steam sale (at the time) other than a bit of 'clunkiness' when driving vehicles, this game is well optimised for my PC and is a genuinely pleasent experience.
5363	0	a	Buggy as hell. They never fixed weird issues like being able to walk through walls.  Hard to tell when you've actually shot someone. No real visual indicator that you've shot someone, so you end up shooting them 5 times out of confusion. Single player campaign seems badly thought out. I basically had to save scum to get off of the first island.  AI is awful. No armory mode or quick mission mode.  I regret buying this in alpha.
1416	1	a	Thought about buying this for a long time. Arma 2 was great, but i wasnt sure if this was any good. If you haven't played Arma 3, buy it now. You wont believe what kind of situations occur there.
4271	1	a	Played 5 mins really good :)
3950	0	a	I'd like to say I like the game and i'm a fan, would i recommend this game to people 'nope' not until they fix the 'sway' down sight, you run 3 feet, you sway, you crawl you sway....you fart, you sway...people are going to say it's 'realistic' that is bull....I hope no one in our armed forces are that wimpy and get tired that fast. if you want to know what it is like for michael j fox in his daily life buy this game...because that is what you'll be getting, a michael j fox shooting game.
2890	1	a	Best â¥â¥â¥â¥in Military Simulation Game Ever  I would my friends to buy it

3146	1	a	My experience- I have over 1500 hours invested between all of the Arma versions, and their mods. more than half of that I spent playing Arma 3, on Epoch and Exile servers.  The mods really do make these games come alive, but if it wasnt for the awesome Dev team and massive amount of content available with the vanilla game, the community as we know it wouldnt exist. I have never shared so many different emotions playing one game, Anger, fear, frustration, joy and curiousity as I let my imagination write a tale every time I log in. Of course your gaming experience will vary depending what type of mod you are playing, but thats just another great asset this game has, you can literally go from a battlefield 4 style game mode with 100+ players on a simply massive map, to a zombie survival in a wasteland, or strugling to survive as a prisoner recently dropped into a unkown island.  If you are looking for THE military simulator, that simply has it all and then some.. this is it.  The learning curve is steep, and there isnt much forgiveness from veteran players, but how you handle being thrown into the fire is up to you. Did I mention the modding community? because its insane, literally everything you wanted to create or play your own custom server is here, from base building, crafting, farming, flying, weapons, vehicles, maps, npcs etc etc etc the list is endless.  Currently I have been playing Exile servers with my Wife, there is persistent base building, missions, trading, looting, raiding, crafting and much more. Eventually you find the community that fits your play style and thats when you really get addicted. PVE/PVP, Roaming AI, Vehicles etc there are thousands of persistent servers running hundreds of variations of each mod, and almost all have very active players and admins.    No Doubt 10/10
2231	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
2372	1	a	Such an awesome game !,.....myself, i like wasteland mode the most :D,..But i hate life mode -_- because i have no idea what to do on it,....
3870	1	a	Playing with friends:  Gayfish 3: 'Homo one, are you in position? Over.'  Me: 'Gayfish three, I am in position. I can see three technicals and two footmobiles, over.'  Gayfish 3: 'Copy that homo one, wait for the sig---'   *Gayfish 3 is interrupted by loud â¥â¥â¥ explosion  Me: 'NECROPHILIAC 1, WHAT THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ DID YOU DO?!'  Necrophiliac 1: 'Homo one, it appears I accidently fired our only javelin missile into that big â¥â¥â¥ motherâ¥â¥â¥â¥in' bush, over.'   Me *Turns to look at Necrophiliac 1  Necrophiliac 1 *Headshotted by 12.7mm MG on Technical, head explodes  Me: 'Jesus â¥â¥â¥â¥ my â¥â¥â¥!'  *Grenade lands at my feet, explodes, I fly about 20 feet back into a wall.  Gayfish 3: 'Ha, y'all got â¥â¥â¥â¥ed. Over.'  Me &amp; Necrophiliac 1: 'Yep, ayylmao.'  The game is really fun, playing it with friends makes it better. The only downside is that it is poorly optimized.  
3234	1	a	If u want a game where bullets actually have a penetration rate, they ricochet depeding on the surface and the type of bullet, an online experience that simulate real life battles, that's the game for you! Probably you'll need a coolio computer for it, but I think it's really worth it, there are a lot of mods and game modes that keep it fresh and cool! Also, you can be whatever u want, a taxi driver, a kamikaze, an eli pilot or just a civilian who doesn't want that people get on his lawn. ALSO! LOOK AT THE GRAPH1C5!!!11! :3
4968	0	a	This game runs poorly on new, state of the art systems. I honestly wish I didn't even buy it. I spent hours trying to get the game to run on my 6700k and gtx 1080, and in the end requested a refund, that was denied because I spent more than two hours trying to make it work. Gpu boosting is terribly implemented, with underclocking in game unless zoomed in. People will tell you that the framerate depends on your cpu, but while zoomed in and the gpu boosts, the framerate is almost playable. As far as the game, get use to getting shot at and killed by people you never see. The game is a frustrating technical mess, that the programmers optimized with the proficiency of a potato.
1806	1	a	If you search for realistic/easy moded/tactical/army/multiplayer/singleplayer/1st/3rd person shooter, then I'm afraid there is nothing better than this.
3063	1	a	Amazing game! The Life mod also changed and bringed a lot of RPG + RP lovers to buy this game.
1887	1	a	I guess it's ok.
1698	1	a	9/10
951	1	a	10/10 zeus is to much fun
1650	1	a	This game is the OFFICIAL life sucker , there is a lifetime of content thousands of mods and custom servers. A must buy.
772	1	a	 I've been looking for a good tactical shooter since Ghost Recon series (the old ones), since the last Advanced Warfigther (PC version, not the console one which is completely different), with slow paced and realistic combat style. For a reason I missed ArmA series, this is my first ArmA game, which meets my expectations in different ways, but, it is not perfect. It is being labeled as a Simulator, but still it is a videogame with so many arcade functions and glitches. Cons at the bottom.
3001	1	a	YES!! Absolutely and easily one of the best games ive played on PC, a must buy!!
2052	1	a	tl;dr - Best meme of 2019  &gt;Be me &gt;Join arma 3 Battleroyal game &gt;wait in lobby for 5 min while layers join &gt;run around &gt;find group of 3 sitting in a circle &gt;I shall join while I wait. &gt;Hey!

Just watch the video for the song. Also add me of you want to play arma 3! I mainly play exile and battleroyal, but will play other things!
2442	1	a	Having played ArmA 2 for almost two years before ArmA 3 came out, I had high expectations for ArmA 3. Now, Before I get into specifics about the game, I have to say ArmA 3 is one of the best games you can get without having to buy any DLC to enjoy a full experience. ArmA 3 is an amazing first person shooter that involves a bit of strategy to win. Whether it means inserting into an enemy camp via SDV or hiking it across altis just to take an enemy helicopter for a spin, You have to come up with a plan to have a successful mission. Now, ArmA 3 isn't just about objectives and killing virtual entities. ArmA is about a massive multiplayer community made up of players, Mod Makers, Scripters, Cinematics Creators, and many more. If you think vanilla has an extremely large amount of content, Wait til you get a look at all of the mods and missions created by just the player base.   Pros  Extremely fun and adrenaline pumping gameplay Crazy amounts of mods available Extremely large and diverse player base Very well made models and objects High end graphics Not very many hackers Large amount of servers to choose from Lots of updates  Cons  Physics can sometimes be a bummer when attempting unusual missions or actions Can be hard to run for some people Can be a little hard to learn how to play Again, Physics  Overall, I give ArmA 3 a 10/10. This game has exceeded my expectations. I can replay this game everyday for a week and still not want to put it down. If you are looking for a first person shooter that involves a crazy amount of strategy and content, This is the game for you.
734	1	a	Terrible Optimisation Desync in every corner of the map Clunky Stance system Vehicles exploding when driving into a fence How did that guy just kill me Why did I just change to walking mode No I didn't just lower my weapon It that a rock on the hill? *BANG* Kids on every single Altis Life server Flying MRAPS everywhere The Admin is now a Goat or random animal  The best Combined arms Milsim game ever made
4064	1	a	If you like military shooters and realism, this is your game.  Only complaint is the MP as its not overly optimized at the moment.
5402	1	a	This combines the FPS that every serious FPS military gamer would want to play, It has great customization for your apparel, the guns are also easily customizable and it looks great on ultra high, even better is the fact that it has a very active gaming community and workshop items are constantly being added. Also, when you kill people you can rob their pants. 11/10
4973	1	a	Buy this game. 20/10
4241	1	a	This is The Best Game i've ever seen ! xD
2515	1	a	definitely recommend!
3987	1	a	This game is amazing and i havent played multiplayer yet :P. Dandellion have to get this and play with me.
2625	1	a	I find the controls a little complex and weird. Only get 30 fps ;-; but graphics are beautiful  In terms of actual gameplay I don't really know what to say yet (20+ hours when writing this reiew) It takes a lot of patience though
862	1	a	Quite simply the best game of its genre. With the many hours of community made missions and the 8n game editor, there is so much to do in this game that will keep you occupied for a long time
3320	1	a	I have over 500 hours on this game, and I enjoyed every single minute. Even when you finish the campain, the mods the community make are even better. So much to do in this game
3685	1	a	Olympus Sucks
4368	0	a	It's a great game. It looks beautiful.   But I can't use a sniper rifle unless I pay another 12 dollars.  Helicopters? 12 dollars.  Apex? 35 more dollars there.   I like the game but I wanted to be a sniper, and I hate being nickled and dimed.  If you got the money and don't mind that, get it.   I however, mind.    
1415	1	a	Rammed into a jet at the Arfield with a Hunter going 100 km/h Flew 1.8 KM from the Airfield in a blown up Hunter.  Rated Game: 10/10   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=398382783 
1016	1	a	Oh the hours I've lost to this... and its still just the Alpha.  .... help... me.
3315	1	a	If you are into military simulation and have a bunch of friends, you can have some fun for the rest of your life!
1044	1	a	I purchased this for the Epoch mod and only play for that, the mechanics are fantastic and the graphics are incredible. although the game and mod have a ways to go yet, still much fun to be had. Worth every penny... Highly recommend. 
36	1	a	story time, me and my brother got this game and with no prior knowledge decided to 1v1. after about 30 mins of fighting he sails to my base and proceeds to destroy it with highly superior troops. but since the gamemode we were playing on required you to destoy everything your opponent owns there was an awkward moment while we wondered why he had not won. Turns out i had a lone settler chopping wood who had been doing that the entire game, after taking control of this settler i started a wild goose chase which ended with my settler hiding behind 3 low level outpost awaiting his doom at the hands of hundreds of enemy soldiers  10/10
109	1	a	I was just cruisin down the street until I came across some russians broken on the side of the road, we couldn't unstderstand eachother and they had guns, Decided I would be nice, come to a complete stop, get in my passenger seat and say hop in... It took them a few seconds to realize my idea because we could not understand eachother at all, I taught them english for a few things on our adventures, They took me to get me a gun, we went to the bank and robbed it, we did drugs, we even killed the police cheif after holding him hostage for 30 minutes. It was a great time, I have to say my favorite part of it all was I the fact they called me charlie and spoke a language I did not understand and I would guess what they wanted me to do until I got it correct, and when I taught them things like 'Shots Fired' they used it to explain things like 'Shots fired Police Cheif Charlie', And that meant 'Shoot the police cheif Charlie' I hope one day we meet again 10/10 would take a adventure on a Russian server with the Russian mafia again.
5240	0	a	this game is cool! dont get me wrong but the fps are bad and the laggs are bad to and i got 90k ^^ if someone wants to play this game buy squad! more fps and u get more action   ps: altis life is total â¥â¥â¥â¥ only apex!
1729	1	a	9/10  Arma 3 is a continuation to the Arma series by Bohemia Interactive, taken to the next level.
3705	1	a	One of the best games i ever played,so many mods,missions..every pearson can find somethink in arma that can enjoy
3933	1	a	I highly recommend Arma 3 on sale. Arma 3 has a learning curve bit of a learning, but is unlike any shooter on the market.   Arma 3 is a bit buggy, so expect rage inducing lag and glitches from time to time. Turst me Booboo, it's most likely not your PC set up. With all the mods and servers that this game features, you are guaranteed to get countless hours of game play out of this game. The campaign story is laughable, but the AI is challenging if you're completionist.  Buy this game if you like:  Great Gun play Teamwork Realistic firefights Flying Helicopters or Jets Survival mods Fighting AI with your buddies PvP with a /steep/ learning curve  Pass on Arma 3 if you don't like:  Large keybind layouts Low framerates Working as a team Dying a lot Not being Rambo Having PTSD   Carry on Soldier.
4779	1	a	I was surfing a quad bike around a gun store. 10/10
3492	1	a	Amazing game, such an improvement on everything that was bad about the second wrapped up in the most beautiful package I've ever opened.
5254	0	a	horrible worst 40$ i have ever spent in my life!! never getting my money back...smh. first of all the game itself didn't work when i went into campaign mode. it froze on basic training mode right at the beginning and game me a white screen with building like blocks, And second when i tried downloading the 'arma 3: exile mode' (that was supposed to be like DAYZ but better) didnt even load into a server. kept telling me that i need to delete or find the missing keys or some â¥â¥â¥â¥! the whole reason i spent $40 was to play the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing exile mod! and that doesnt even work smh so now happy. if anyone can help me out and tell me what to do to play exile that would be greatly appreciated. thank you
2256	1	a	Outstanding 10/10 for great action and simulation! this sandbox brings more than creativity!
2113	1	a	(Edited to update pros, cons, and opening statement.) I've put in 279 hours on ArmA III so far. I've played ArmA: Cold War Assault, ArmA 2, ArmA 2: Operation Arrowhead, and ArmA III. I am a big fan of this series due to that it is very realistic and the possibilities are nearly endless thanks to the Steam Workshop integration. ArmA III takes ArmA II and improves it plus more. ArmA III is more smooth and less clunky compared to ArmA II. ArmA III is a lot better then ArmA II because whereas you had to go to 3rd party websites to get mods for ArmA II, ArmA III has Steam Workshop to get most of your add-ons. The integration of Steam Workshop is the icing on the cake for this game because the integration is so tight knit into the ArmA III launcher. A new addition to the ArmA series is a launcher, ArmA III has a launcher that starts up before you play the game and it allows you to choose which mods you want active while playing or if you want to play stock ArmA III. This launcher also adds in 'Presets', you can use these presets for servers if you are on a RP server which has special mods you can check the servers mods, and add them to a preset. The combat in ArmA III is more refined and smooth compared to ArmA II. ArmA III brings a stamina system which affects your weapon accuracy after sprinting for long periods of times (this can be disabled on servers). You can also crouch run now! This has been asked for since ArmA II and they brought it in ArmA III. Another new feature they added is the ability to run while swapping weapons. There are also 9 different stances that allows you to be more flexible in a firefight and rewards anyone that uses them correctly. Here is a pros and cons list for this game!  Pros: - More refined and robust combat system - More refined and robust movement system - Adds in more realism - A vast variety of weapons - Weapon attachments such as Suppressors, Sights, Bi-pods, Flashlights/Lasers. - New stamina system - Constantly receiving updates from Bohemia Interactive - New DLC's and Map's being added - Steam Workshop Integration - Flexible and useful launcher - Amazing servers - New 3D Editor which came in Eden update - Better resource management with it better balancing out your GPU usage and CPU usage which came in the Eden update - More Refined Textures which came in the Eden update - A tad bit more optimized then previously which came in the Eden update - Constant improvements to UI, Preformance, Lighting, and Textures  Neutral: - Steam Trading Cards (for anyone that is interested in them, that's why it's under 'Neutral'.) -Frame rate can be a problem due to optimization (not Bohemia's fault, they can't optimize a game with such freedom for mods, and a open editor.)  Cons: - FPS Drops upon entering highly populated areas - Combat can be hectic at times if you do not understand compass bearings and map coordinates - Very steep learning curve - Desync is still a very big problem but that's more server-side - No FoV (Field of View) option, the default FoV can make you feel a bit claustrophobic. There is a tool that you can get to fix this, you can get it here  http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=21179 .  It's hard to find cons for this game but those are the only ones I can think of. My rating of this game is a 8.5/10 it takes ArmA II's problems and improves upon them to make one amazing military simulator.
521	1	a	Great game worth every penny one of my favorites games of all time
773	1	a	It figures that I finally buy this game and then it goes on sale. Still, not unhappy with my purchase.
2548	1	a	Not your Grandaddys Call of Duty.
1749	1	a	Great community and really fun playing on servers playing in groups with other people. plenty of game modes avaiable, however the DLC is very pricey and should not be that much.
3978	1	a	best army simulator game
1041	1	a	Well what can i say about ArmA 3.... It's awesome but also kinda frustrating because its still a ArmA game. It's that kind of game which the the game itself is more dangerous than other player's or AI. We all know THAT pile of garbage or THAT fence that lets us float and after a while you get hammered to the floor with a power of 9000 Newton. All this time you wasted to get there with the specific weapon or whatever is gone. We all need to learn live with it. The best about this game are the Mods that exist. (Exile, Breaking Point, or whatever mods exist) and costum Missions like King of the Hill and Spec ops Operation and Wasteland. There is also the Life mod but i dont care about them sooo... yeah go play it for yourself. I actually dont even remember the Campaign of this Game which is kinda funny since the only thing worth buying this game are the mods. Nobody cares about the Bohemia stuff (the DLC's are another story).   The only problem i have with this game is the performance.  The best thing about this game is the Gameplay/Mods/Map  All time Favourite of mine 7/10 Glitches  Would kÃ®ll myself in rage again
4539	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ ai but is great fun. pls buy
532	1	a	The ArmA series stole my life 4 years ago, and continues to do so.  10/10
836	1	a	This game is so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing good
615	1	a	Amazingly fun game, takes a bit of getting used to but once you've got it its golden. I recommend this game to everyone.
2828	1	a	ARMA3 is such a great improvment over ARMA2 it's....Amazing  If you're looking at the price and you go...ohh It's a bit much...  Factor in how much time you can waste on this game over some cheap POS on a steam Sale  It truely is an awesome game!
1284	0	a	It' a good game with amazing graphicks, good gameplay, lots of mods and great multiplayer. However i got bored so fast (I spend a lot of time in fps Counter Strike- 386 h) and for me its too boring to spend that money. But it depends on you and what you like this is my personal oppinion you might like it. Thanks for your attention and rememeber to check out the game!
29	1	a	Remember when the Chinese fought the Russians in the Caribbean? How about when they built entire villages in Texas and defended against Germany?   Historical accuracy is on point.
5386	0	a	I regret buying the DLC... The karts are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ly stupid. The rifles are total BS garbage.... and the helicopters I can get from Armaholic or Play withSIX. Just get Play withSix and download weapons mods, vehicles etc... If I could do it over again I wouldn't pay $1 for the DLC that should have been included wiith the game to begin with. The game ARMA 3 is awesome... The DLC is underhanded.
4224	1	a	I really like this game it is so fun the editor mode is really fun to play around with making your own scenerios or just having a massive war for the hell of it so to the creators I say Arigato!
3110	1	a	Extremly fun and dynamic game with endless opportunity. Yet the DLC's are so expensive its isnane and any servers with DLC items, vehicles etc spam your screen constantly to buy it. Love the game but the DLC's are overpriced at $40 for a new map and a few vehicles like thats over the top
2895	1	a	It's decent if you have a monster computer otherwise it's a lag-fest and it'll be hell to get it running smoothly.
3569	1	a	Still absolutely worth it
410	1	a	  Review: Arma 3
3367	1	a	YOU THINK THIS IS A FUTURE ENDEAVOR? ITS NOT ITS JUST NO â¥â¥â¥â¥ YOU IT ISN'T
714	1	a	Nothing on Earth can run this game. What I can do, however, is enjoyable.
3292	1	a	Would recommend if you have a strong computer. Sounds are vastly improved over Arma II and combat is very great.
3951	1	a	It takes a while to get used to the controls and everything but after that u have one of the best most fun open world game in the world. I will suggest tho if your new start with the campiagn without watching walkthroughs and then play a bit of Altis life life but overall i would definetly recommened it.
4733	1	a	This game is just one of the best fps i have ever seen.
1290	0	a	i bough this game by my old laptop which had minimum req. . it was always crash to desktop after 5 min game play . there wasnt a solution. after 2 years i buyed desktop pc for arma 3 literally. specs is r7 265 amd fx 6300 its not a bad rig. i can play on high-ultra most other new games . whats is my fps now ? do you worry about it ? IT IS ''15'' !!!!!!!!!!!!! LOWER OR HIGHER OPTIONS NOTHING DIFFERENCE ITS F... 15 FPS ON KOTH MODE . dont f...ing buy this game if u dont have 5000 dolars rig . BAD Optimization...................... sry for bad english. ALMAYIN ALDIRMAYIN 10000 TL LIK PC NIZ YOKSA
2326	1	a	Military simulator with extremely large maps, lots of different modes, and vehicles. Spent a lot of time on Breaking Point mod, it's very fun and rewarding.
3938	1	a	Playing this game on a public server with random people will make you hate this game. Playing this game on a private server with a chosen few will make you love this game.  
2162	1	a	This game is time consuming and addidctive I highly recommend this game.
3501	1	a	Really great game and worth your money and time. Nothing else to add.
2333	1	a	A great improvement over the second game. Animations are very good and fluid, alot of the clunky controls have been alleviated. The games visuals are pretty nice. Multiplayer is where this game truly shines, however to play at a stable framerate in multiplayer, you are going to need an above average PC unless you are willing to do some config changes and graphic downgrades. All in all, I recommend this game. It's worth its price in terms of content, and it has workshop compatibility.
3922	1	a	Can someone please buy Arma 3 as a gift to me please :(???? You see, I am very poor and I just cant afford a game like Arma 3. I just love this intense game and it has a wonderful sensation. I wish I could just get my hands on it but I dont have the required amount of mey just yet. Im just begging anyone out there that is kind to buy me this game as a gift. It would touch my heart deep inside me ;). Im crying now as I type. If anyone out there has a heart that is strong enough to be generous I would Highly appreciate it :). Most people won't listen but it will be awesome. THANKYOU!!! ;)
2487	1	a	a must have for any milsim fan
2919	1	a	I think Arma 3 is an awesome game to play. This game has a large amount of custom scenario missions which are really fun to do. I definitely recommend this game.  10/10
251	1	a	I haven't met any Russians in this game yet 10/10
4320	1	a	Its grate
944	1	a	best war simulation  best war game  Perfect Multiplayer .... I love thissssssss game
4980	1	a	its cool
961	1	a	Great game, better with friends... Modding Arma brings it into it's own, I've hunted(and been hunted by) dinosaurs, ridden in mechs, escaped the same damned island time and time again, been part of 100 player missions, robbed banks, smuggled heroine, been a trucker, raided bases in exile/dayz/wasteland/breaningpoint/whateverthenewpoisonis and done much much more.
2790	1	a	This game is great. I have dedicated all my free time to playing this. When it gets boring just download some mods!
4996	0	a	This game has pretty good looking graphics. The options or configure menu could be hard to understand to some players. The controls are overcomplicated. Ragdoll physics is horrible. But the game is trying to be more tactical like,well its not tactical at all most of you enemies run out in the open like 'Hey! Look at me! Shoot me!'. Playing alone isn't to great but with friends you capture the whole experience of Arma 3. The maps are huge so you have to do lots of exploring,pretty cool if you enjoy exploring. The vehicles have their own controls maybe except the land vehicles and some other type of vehicles. The air vehicles are hard to control unless you played the rest of the Armas.(BTW still don't know how to use air vehicles). Is this a full release or a beta? I do not know it has plenty after plenty of bugs to fix. Like when that time I shot some one his body had an oversized neck the body itself had its body armor turned into a size of a pea. This game is 4/10 hard to recommend.
4597	1	a	I can be a rabit 10/10
658	1	a	Very much worth the buy, I can say with over 900 Hours at this point, that the game is so much fun. By far I can say this game is and will always be worth the 60$. There is so much fun to be had with friends, whether it be RP, KotH, or Capture the Island. This goes without saying that the Modding community is phenominal, as well as the Arma 3 community as a whole. If you or a friend would like hours of entertainment, or a place for some serious RP, whether that be tactical or comedical, BUY THIS.
4222	1	a	ARMA 3 is a great game with a moderate learning curve. If you liked ARMA 2 you will also like ARMA 3. Be warned, this is not your fast pace Battlefield 3/4 experience. ARMA 3 goes for a more realistic approach to the FPS game. This game has a great modding comunity and will keep you coming back for years to come.
5020	1	a	Amazing game, with a detailed and epic campain sure to keep onself busy for a decent amount of time. the co-op is also epic, great to jam with friends. 10/10 would buy again.
2308	1	a	Arma 3 is a good game, but it is still a Work In Progress. There are many bugs and glitches that will be punched out as time goes by, but that shouldn't keep you from buying the game. Look at Arma 2, it has become a huge success, mostly tahnks to DayZ but its RP aspect. Arma 3 is a truly Next-Gen game which is capable of doing so much. Buy it, don't ask any questions, just do it.
2597	1	a	An impressively complex and yet easy to enjoy military sim game...you can spend your time designing massive battles and engagements or flying around as a helicopter pilot...or covertly leading a squad behind enemy lines....or directing mortar fire....a really great game.
1462	1	a	...
4194	0	a	No i won't recommend this game. I'm sorry but i'm spend more time trying to fix the game to get workshop scenarios to work because steam can't update a game properly and you have to redownload it again. Because every dev update breaks mods compatibilities, because mods get corrupted because steam is unstable, because mods gets corrupted when the game crash... I barely spend time playing the game too busy trying to get everything to work. What a farce.
1555	1	a	I don't even own this game. 10/10 i'd play it again
4065	1	a	Very First Minutes: Oh god oh god who shot me who shot me ?! 30 mins. later: I see you but I won't shoot you because I can't. 60 mins. later: â¥â¥â¥â¥ing campers â¥â¥â¥â¥ing CAMPERS ! 1 months later: SITREP Grind 061357, Enemy 200 metres R.U.A  
2215	1	a	This game is only good if your name isnt Lewis
2750	1	a	not too bad not too good just give me achievement
313	1	a	Great graphics, and great storyline. Only problem is that they need to add steam cloud, cause when I transferred this to my computer, all my hard work was gone. But other than that, amazing game.
291	1	a	I have around 500 hours in Arma 3 at the time of writing this review.  Arma 3 is both epic, and hugley frustrating for me.  EPIC - as a military sim, it is outstanding. We heavily mod the game to our 'light' milsim requirements and frankly im blown away with how good things can be.  FRUSTRATING - I have to have a few good friends do all the work preparing our missions, sorting our mod packs. I simply can't do it technically. Lucky I have some great friends, but it's alot of work for them (but it keeps them off the streets eh.........)  The more standard mod's wasteland, exile, king of the hill etc are real fun if thats your thing.  Be prepared to be immersed and have a blast with Arma 3!
2906	1	a	Game was the best purchase i have had in many years and i look forward to playing it in the future.
3880	1	a	&gt;plays Arma 3  &gt;thinks he masters game &gt;finds out about ACE3 &gt;becomes novice   amazing
4985	0	a	 https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/Arma_3_Analytics   Opt-out and not Opt-in. There is no prompt to inform the user of this while launching the game.  PSA: 'Anonymous Data' doesn't exist.    UPDATE 07/11/2016
318	1	a	The BEST military game that i have ever played !!! The game even gets better when you join a milsim community, and add some moddâs just to give you that bit more realism.
2694	1	a	Must be one of the best experiences of my life. If it wasn't for this free weekend i wouldnt have found it and i wouldnt have played it so thank you Bohemi &lt;3 You made the best 3 days of my life and now im off to buy the bloody game because i think im addicted.. i only buy games im addicted to, Thank you from the bottom of my hearth.
1611	1	a	This game is a jolly load of fun.
3712	1	a	10/10 with with nice mods
4570	1	a	Ran than jumped off a stone wall than flew like supa man than flew to my death 11/10 BEST GAME NA
476	1	a	One of the most realistic Military Simulators I have ever played. I have always loved the 'ARMA' Series, but this game is incredible. I especially love it for the Editor and Virtual Arsenal features. The new Engine it uses creates amazing visuals and effects. The modding capabilities in this extends the amount of weapons, gear, units, maps and vehicles, and even full conversion mods, to make it even more amazing than it already is. It is a great game to play with friends if you like the idea of being tactical. Buy it now.
4004	1	a	This game is definitely a direct improvement over Arma 2. If you are familiar with that game, it is very easy to transition over to this game. I especially enjoy the mission editor. The mission editor has a pretty steep learning curve, but enough tutorials and trial and error will get you competent with the editor's logic. The game is much better optimized than Arma 2 was, but it still runs pretty awful on multiplayer, even with a high spec PC. I ended up having to turn down my view distance to a pretty low amount to consistently get 40 fps on multiplayer, because the fps largely relies on the server's power. On single player or a small server of 5-10 people, I could just about max out the game with a steady 60 fps. I am disappointed with the DLC though, as it really doesn't add much at all to the game at this point, and it retails at $25. I would recommend picking this game up, even if you have never played the other Arma games, because it seems like it has a much smaller learning curve than previous titles, but is still just as in-depth. This game is a good purchase, especially on sale, the DLC on the other hand is not currently worth it.
644	1	a	Love it
1560	1	a	what's arma
129	1	a	I love shooters I love realism I love editors  I love zeus I love multiplayer I love singleplayer  I love mods I love this game
3885	1	a	Arma 3 is by far the most realistic, most entertaining, and most intence war simulator of all time! If the technology is availible this game should come out for next gen. consoles. Not only is this an amazing sandbox but it also blows every other war game out of the water! Keep up the good work Bohemia Interactive, and step aside Battlefield and COD because a new age has started. The age of a real war.
2651	1	a	This game looks great and its all you need in a millitary game now a days so i might buy it
4081	1	a	Love this game, firstly mechanics are wonderful! Graphics are amazing, and it is challening! First game I have played in a while where you can play and if you are new people help you out. I have put a lot of time into this game and some of the mods are amazing! But don't get me wrong. There are a few downsides. Sometimes can be hard to run if you have a not so good computer but overall I love it!   Love the bullet ballistics, simple and easy to learn. Love the teamwork involved in coop. People actually help eachother in stead of them running around with guns in their hands yelling'Allahu ackbar'. Brilliant community! Amazing mods!
5157	0	a	Too advanced, and teamates will ditch you constantly. Also many framerate issues.
5060	0	a	Outright unoptimised
687	1	a	YES, ARMA 3 is a tough game to get into. Being such an open world combat emulator it is by definition quite complex. In the number of keys used, options and gameplay variation.  Since the addition of the tutorials and 'Bootcamp' missions, learning how to play has become much easier with step by step instructions to build up experience and confidence with the various controls and options.  For those willing to spend some time learning how it all works, they will be rewarded with countless hours of interesting and varied gameplay.  If you are interested in first person battles with vehicles, aircraft, watercraft and loads of weapons, then its well worth looking into.  If its good enough for the US, Canadian, UK, Australian and Newzealand armies to train with then its good enough for you... (See 'VBS3', military version of ARMA)
3102	1	a	Wait for ACE and ACRE. The minute they both drop I'll be on Arma 3 for days.
1907	1	a	GOOD Play
1883	1	a	A game in which AI infantry can headshot you, while you're inside of a jet going supersonic. 10/10
1400	1	a	Great Game nothign else to say, Its really fun to play with friends
3826	1	a	Absolutely worth the 20 or less FPS I got for an entire year until I upgraded my PC. Game is well worth the price even if you run on a toaster; gameplay is beyond fun if you play with a high amount of mods, or just modded servers in general. Pretty much unlimited amounts of things you can do.
4220	1	a	ArmA III is a worthy successor to ArmA 2, taking the flaws of ArmA 2 and perfecting the game engine - mostly. There are still numerous bugs, AI problems, and much multiplayer FPS lag, but if you can get around these problems, this open-world sandbox military simulator is well worth the money.
4752	1	a	I stopped playing all other 'war games' the day I got this ! Brilliant game 12/10
2299	1	a	is it good for a windows 8 HP laptop?  
3059	1	a	Real life military simulator.  The campaign is a little hard, but it gets you used to the Arma 3 mechanics, which is basically you will die 70% of the time by 1 bullet.   The multiplayer is where the majority of the fun is at. Very time consuming, and if you find a group, you will be playing all the time. A3Launcher will be your gift from God for finding servers and automatically installing updates for online servers. Multiplayer experience can vary, as the gameplay/mods are different server to server, but it essentially consists of building a base, making money, and killing people in fun and creative ways. Some servers have zombies and roaming AI. FYI, if you came here because of the DayZ Frankie youtube videos, I would recommand watching un-blemished Arma 3 gameplay if you want to see the reality of multiplayer.
5173	0	a	trash game u need to shoot some one about 4-6 times with 7.62 in the head to kill someone trash dont buy
1018	1	a	For me is the best game ever &lt;3 !!! Of course i recommend !!! If you play with friends you can add more fun !!!
4721	1	a	Been a big fan of what BI does. Now that we get to Epoch it all up it's even more amazing. From great single player missions to user created content. This is a game that can keep you entertained for years to come!
4803	1	a	Pretty Awesome
3627	1	a	Arma III is the best chopper crash test, LSD dragon catch simulator out there!!!! Watch out for druken pilots and soldier, everyone on arma is drunk or has take some drugs!!! And the level beginning   'Euhm I hope weÂ´re not gonna to die again... Me too Me too ... And we crashed again... Affirmative Shi t F a c k'  Well seriously this game is awesome, there are bugs, there are many bugs BUT this are funny as hell.  So if you got so often dissappointed by EA or Activision about their next 'big' title. You should buy this game!! At first I was like I donÂ´t know Arma I wonÂ´t buy it, and then there was a Steam sales and Arma 3 was free to play, and what should I say.... I got 19Hours play time since beginning, and just bought that game. And a big + is also the multiplayer community is that what it should have been in Battlefield, almost everyone is nice and you can work as a team together to get your objectiv.
2036	1	a	played the tutorial,i already love the game
1023	1	a	Probably the best game for serious players who can work together to accomplish the mission.  
1726	1	a	Wow , why dayz couldn't be like this , better performance means more fun , but like your videocard doesn't change anything for dayz , cause i had gt 430 it was 30 fps everything on low even resolution , bought gtx 750 ti and nothing cahnges wtf. i don't even know if this is dayz or arma 3 review but wasteland is fun and battle royal :) 9/10
5083	0	a	Broken multiplayer + horrible singleplayer campaign = Bohemia Interactive.  Thanks guys.
1579	1	a	This is a great game it combines a bit of the ACE mod DayZ loadout vibe and great graphics!
2141	1	a	This game is THE â¥â¥â¥â¥!
4744	1	a	There should be more sales on this game 
4526	1	a	Everyone knows it is a nice game
3610	1	a	Must have game, best mil sim with great mods.
4150	0	a	lol...I don't understand how it got such high reviews. people say mods make the game....well that's not the way it should be imo. If the game sucks without mods...well...it just sucks.   First 10 minutes of playing the game 2 major bugs. 1 invisible mobs..2 I got stuck going into the next campaign with no ammo for my weapons...I could not go to the ammo stockpile and do a damn thing about it...don't know why, don't care, done playing. Where are all these weapons they talk about? Maybe I didn't get far enough through the game but having only 2 or 3 guns to choose from was just boring...and damn the AI is badass...picking me off a mile away with a gun that in reality you couldn't hit a person with from 3 blocks away....absurd.  I don't know maybe the multiplayer is awesome....sounds like that's why people like it...single player? beh...save your cash imo.
2467	1	a	I had a friend gift me Arma 3 and I always wanted to play it. Despite all of the negativity some people give it I enjoy the game myself. There is so much you can do in Arma 3 that sometimes it is hard to name them all. Having 893+ hours I think it is safe to say I would recommend to anybody. From super serious to very calm game modes Arma has it all. If you choose to get Arma3, see you on the battlefield.
2268	1	a	I would fully recommend this game, it is fun, and amazing. Who ever is a fan of realism shooters, this will be it!  I have been a fan of ArmA all the way from the beginning from the first games that was Operation Flashpoint, to where it is today. With ArmA you will have hours of fun, whether it is building missions, messing around in the editor or downloading the countless mods that are available on Workshop and  Armaholic.com!   Would fully recommend 10/10!
3039	1	a	its a great game but flying is hard and i don't know how to take off in helicopters and planes. 
1805	1	a	well worth the money and i have over 1300 hours of gameplay
2725	1	a	Sandbox &amp; Editor, what else could you need more? â¥ MP, Armaholic, Workshop
2570	1	a	I really enjoyed this game i love of the possiable missions the easy editor the amazing story line the only part i dont like about this game is the fact that i have to pay another 32 dollars for marksman dlc and helicopters dlc which should just be a part of the game where i dont need to pay another 16 dollars just to be a sniper as i loved to be on arma 2 i do highly reccomend this game its a must play
934	1	a	If you are looking for another FPS to play like COD, this is not for you. This game brings a much larger meaning to combat oriented games. The situations that you have to adapt to, the fact that the map is about 19 sq. km, and how fluid everything is compared to Arma II, thesse are all factors of the this game that stand out to me the most. This game is not for any COD player (or Battlefield at that) that just wants to shoot people for fun. Once you get used to everything and how the game is played, it really latches on to you. Especially when you have some buddies to bring with you.
679	1	a	i bought the game 2 days ago played it 24/7 but then today I clicked on the app and it showed that box 'preparing to launch arma' but then it dissapered and the launcher wouldnt come up please help
1199	1	a	So many game modes to choose from, including the ability to make your own including missions and mods, arma 3 is much more than a military game. It is a platform for all sorts of multiplayer fun. The bugs are a many, especially ones that make you question the 'realism' but it adds to the laughter and you get used to it. For a game so old, the devs are still working hard on it, always bringing updates with new content as well as bug fixes. TL:DR well worth it if you like Multiplayer games and shooting people.
2788	1	a	This is the best game out there so download it now or u will be depressed for the rest of ur life. The mods for this game are great too! Like Breakingpoint, Epoch, Battle Royale, and many more great mods!
1816	1	a	10/10 would allah uckbar my helicopter into civis on Life Servers again.
1439	1	a	just a really good game
4016	1	a	Almost 40 hours into the game and I can honestly say it's the best game I've purchased on Steam, amazingly fun, action packed and a lot of things to do, never gotten tired of it and I'll continue to play it until I find another game as funny as this one.
4918	1	a	Remember when driving into a chicken-wire fence would blow up your car around 60% of the time?  Let's bring those days back.
1686	1	a	Great game love playing it.
1203	1	a	The third part of the legendary ARMA-Series. A new milestone in the history of Military Simulations in realtime. Awesome. Great Work and thanks to Bohemia. It must be continued. Endlazer.
3211	1	a	I played it a bit. It's okay.
3908	1	a	recommend this game HAVANA6 screw betafail4 or 5
1512	1	a	Great Military Sim. That being said, way too many people under 18 which really hurts the maturity level of the game. Lots of stupid stuff to deal with in Player Vs. Player. Ovearll I would recommend to anyone looking for a realism many other FPS can't give you.
3153	1	a	Arma 3... Sometimes really fun and sometimes very annoying.   But better than any other Arma game in the world.   Really fun when you mod it or join a Taskforce  (TF163) :P
4827	1	a	Probably the most realistic combat sims ever
4718	1	a	I love Arma 3 Altis Life, The Quality of the server you play on depends on the admins, I love the game over all. 10/10
1383	1	a	Play this game or U suck at life
153	1	a	When The Community Can change the game logic
3453	1	a	You love war? you will love this ...
5338	0	a	well done,old campaign saves not working,thx .....not buying apex *thumbs up* in more than 20 years wall glitch still possible,wow,well done as well,sorry, im done with you behomia! You are just â¥â¥â¥â¥ing kidding and mess around with players, Hall had reasons to leave and im quiet confident why... Dayz was a ripp off,like the whole series,im really sorry to say that,but i was a big fan ....flashpoint(the raly first one) flashed me so hard and thats you behave over years of loyality.... im done.....im so mad
1380	1	a	my favorite shooter so much to do and learn its awsome SP pretty good aswel much better MP with a good team and a optimised map/mission
3614	1	a	Good game, â¥â¥â¥â¥ company.
4396	1	a	I Think it's ok
4187	1	a	is good pls buy 
2147	1	a	Very nice game, Realistic. Downloaded it after a few months, Laptop hant handle it anymore probably due to the updates, sucks alot but the game was awesome for me!
2098	1	a	Logs on to King of the Hill server. Gets a truck w/ a gun mounted on back. Drives down to a crossroad. Waits for teammates to drive by. Shoots teammates and kills them. Listens to people raging in chat. Sees around half a dozen RVs driving down the dirt road with a tank behind. Kills everybody but the tank. Tank steamrolls me. 10/10 would 1v1 a tank again.
4384	0	a	buggy, annoying and laggy  srry but its to much :/
3267	1	a	10/10
5131	0	a	This game looked promising in alpha but has been patched to a worse and worse state ever since. Don't let any of the pretty screenshots or clips fool you. It's practically still an alpha game and will probably never leave this state. If you're the type of person who finds fun in playing scenarios against extremely stupid bots, this might serve. For anyone else, don't waste your money. The netcode is absolutely horrible - the game is full of lagging, rubberbanding and anything else you might expect from a game that hasn't been finished at all. No matter how fast of a hellmachine you have below your desk, the game will almost always run at max. ~35fps in multiplayer, a lot less if in action. So aiming and hitting someone is rather a game of luck than anything else. Further, the gun and aiming mechanics are absolutely cumbersome and just annoy the crap out of you in combination with the weak engine. Right now you just aim at someone, fire, and very often absolutely nothing happens. No hit, no blood, nothing, even after firing a whole magazine at the enemy while keeping the crosshairs exactly at him, from a distance of, say, 50-100m. Does actually happen. In multiplayer the enemy you try to eliminate then starts running around like a rabbit (because they know exactly how it looks on your screen - it makes it even harder to hit him, because he starts teleporting from one point to another), and tries to spot you while doing so. Yes, that's right. In a 'military simulation' it has proven to be more effective to run around like a crazy ape, right in the open field, than to look for cover and continue from there. The structures look mostly the same and are full of bugs aswell. You can't go through a door without getting stuck in some way, in like 50% of cases you get stuck right at the bottom of stairs and have to take a step back and try again (no need to mention how much it's going to trigger you if you get killed because of this stupid sh..). So stairs and doors are to be considered extremely risky to use - just like in real life right? Right, it's a simulation, it has to be realistic!  In spite of everything the developer of this game absolutely avoids improving the engine or the netcode since release in any way, they rather design some new weapons they can wrap into a dlc and sell for 10 bucks. Since alpha the game has used cpu power in an absolutely unoptimized manner, has therefore extremely poor performance on even newer machines and just makes it impossible to have a nearly fluid aiming experience. There is always some lag or stutter that often will decide about the outcome of a confrontation.  Like I said in the beginning, there was a lot of hope and potential for this game when alpha released, but this is now more than 3 years ago and not many of the relevant aspects and weaknesses of this game were actually improved. It might actually have gotten worse since then. I bought it for like 20â¬ back then and even for this price I would definitely not buy it again. Do not buy this crippled piece of software.
3166	1	a	Realistic bullet drop, Too much wind sounds, Realistic Terrain, Custom Gamemodes, This is like Garry`s Mod but merges with Battlefield, Funny Players, Easy to fly a Jet but hard to land, LARGE MAP IS GOOD.  Should you buy this game? YES. wait... idk someone gave it to me :|
446	1	a	This is way superior to Arma 2. Better graphics, better animations, better physics. Alot of bugs but it's to be expected on a game of this scale. However with all the mods it's one of the best game out there!
4792	1	a	I love and I hate it
5093	0	a	WHY DO I HAVE TO PAY 15 DOLLARS FOR 2 CHOPPERS WHEN THE GAME ALREADY COSTS $45?????? SO STUPID
3484	1	a	A beautifully done, full-on military simulation that is a lot of fun to play.
790	1	a	I went as Zeus in multiplayer and kep moving the truck when a dude was trying to get in it. Ended up blowing him up with arty's.   I spawned an enemy tank infront of a squad in multiplayer as Zeus.   I struck lightning to the medic reviving someone.   10/10 trolling simulator
2805	1	a	It's a game.
2689	1	a	Generally a good game but I wouldnt play it for the campaigjn, For me its just a fun game about city life (not military)
1906	1	a	Better than2..
2173	1	a	Here's the thing about ARMA: it is what you and the people you play with make it. Nothing more and nothing less. This has always been the case with the ARMA series.   The vanilla game with no mods is decent if you have a group of friends to play it with, boring if you don't. The mod community is enormous and most people play versions that are modded in some way. This ranges from relatively small quality-of-life changes like ACE to total conversions like Exile and Epoch. The game can be an ultra hardcore milsim or a somewhat more arcadey (but still with a lot of realistic elements) shooter. The game can be hilariously buggy at times. 90% of your playtime, it will be stable, and a lot the bugs are caused by mods, but you will encounter them even in vanilla.  In multiplayer, this game is VERY INTENSIVE ON SERVER HARDWARE. It takes a beast of a server with a beast of a connection to host 50+ people with no lag. A lot of server owners don't set their population limits appropriately and you end up with laggy servers when they get full. You might have to look around for a server that's set up properly for the number of people allowed on it. You won't have to look terribly far, though, and once you find some good servers, the multiplayer is great.  I'll mainly address the quality of simulation, since that's what ARMA is primarily intended to be. Mods are very much personal-preference based and outside the control of the developer so it wouldn't be fair to go on about them too much.  World Simulation: Very good. The engine includes a host of robust options for simulating weather, and the weather affects the world and your ability to fight in it in predictable, realistic ways. Fog creeps up from valleys in the morning like you would expect it to, for example. The simulation does fall short, however, when you consider how the weather affects the ground; there's no struggling through mud after a heavy rain, but that is something that no modern engine of which I am aware can currently achieve.  Infantry Simulation: Excellent. Ballistics are calculated appropriately, first-focal-plane reticles graduated in milliradians can be used to estimate range and hold-over properly. Terminal projectile performance when penetrating barriers, body armor, and previously living tissue can occasionally be a bit off, but mostly functions as one might expect in reality. Glancing or multiple ricochets can be downright wonky but don't have a huge effect on the game since most of their energy is spent on the bounce. Occasionally a bullet will hit a helmet at just the right angle to glance off instead of deliver what would have been a headshot, which can be realistic or not depending on the exact circumstances. Infantry is the most realistically simulated part of the game and has clearly had the most time spent on it.  Air Vehicle Simulation: Good. Be warned, all flight models are simplified. If you're into flying, it's not going to be as close to reality as DCS or Flight Sim X are, but those are dedicated flight sims. Fixed-wing aircraft work just fine. CAS has to coordinate with infantry on the ground to be effective. Air superiority can be a little underwhelming. As a pilot, most of your time will likely be spent in rotary-wing aircraft, either as air support or as a transport pilot. Rotary wing flight models are very simplified and don't factor the finer aspects of rotary-wing aviation such as ground effect and translational lift, and they barely acknowledge rotor torque, but they are otherwise passable. The big challenge for aviation in ARMA comes from knowing how to use your aircraft appropriately and make tactical decisions with your approaches, rather than the actual act of flying.  Ground Vehicle Simulation: Passable. Ground vehicles function just fine, if not in a completely realistic manner. The main issue is that they can take damage from very strange sources when you wreck them into something. For example, crashing an ATV into the wrong type of bush at relatively low speed can cripple the vehicle and nearly kill you, but encountering a small construction fence at the same speed can simply knock the fence over while you continue on your way. As long as you aren't wrecking, the vehicles otherwise behave in fairly predictable ways in terms of encountering small-arms fire, mines, IEDs, and larger ordnance.  Sea Vehicle/Diving Simulation: Passable. Honestly, there's not much reason to go in the water on the current maps in ARMA, but it includes a lot of options for interacting with the water such as submarines, boats, wetsuits, and chest-mounted rebreathers like the ones used by Navy SEALS. The depth of simulation kind of ends there, with no provision for breathing gas mixes or operating depth considerations on the rebreather, which is stated to be a pure-oxygen variant and as such would be fatal at depths of 20 feet and below. On Altis and Stratis, the world below sea-level is well finished, there's just sadly not much reason to go there. Underwater controls can be a little awkward but usable.  AI Simulation: Borderline to poor. The AI are fairly dumb regardless of difficulty setting. Difficulty is increased by allowing the AI to cheat more and more. The end result is that the most 'difficult' AI will do things like spot you through a building with xray and aimbot you through the wall. If I had to choose one aspect that Bohemia really needs to work on for future installments, the AI is it.  In conclusion, I recommend ARMA 3 if you have some buddies to play it with or are willing to find some. It's a solid milsim, or a pretty solid whatever-you-want-to-make-it-through-mods. The game depends very much on interaction with others, however, and the odds are if you get it for a single-player experience, you won't enjoy it too much.  UPDATE:  Post-Apex, ARMA 3 remains very much what you make it. The mod community is huge and varied, tons of servers are available for vanilla and modded games, and the base game is still great at its core. The occasional bug still rears its ugly head, but there are far fewer of them than there were even a year ago, and they tend to not be as potentially gamebreaking.
450	1	a	Whole lot of fun. Have yet to play the vanilla game, or the SP... the mods are amazingly cool. Wasteland is killer, and Breaking Point= DayZ for ARMA3. Graphically awesome, performance is stellar. Ballistics seem to be pretty much on point too. Vehicle control kinda sucks, but this isn't FORZA so...
156	1	a	i don't even own this game why can i review it  10/10 it's meh
1965	1	a	Hope you have a good computer
1428	1	a	Well lets see where to start, this game is by far one of the best FPS simulator heavily moddable game that I have ever played. It's extremely addicting and to be honest if anyone in game is ever rude, you can shoot them in their face with a .50 cal behaviour Modification round =). I adore this game at first I had no intention of ever playing it due to ArmA 2 being something I was completely used too and having read bad reviews I was reluctant. This game was gifted to me and ever since I tried it, well lets just say the people who wrote the bad reviews obviously lack the intellectual capacity to flip on a light switch. I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves FPS.
144	1	a	The only thing in the known universe more addictive than heroin.
3323	1	a	Reccomended for: people who like tactical realism  not recomended for: peopole who like fps games that dont simulate the army, like COD
4530	1	a	Simple.I loved it gj.Putting money on this game. 
1318	1	a	Do you want to die a lot? Good, 'cuz you will.
1146	1	a	Look at the amount of hours I have played and guess if I recommend it.  Good: Military realism Large map Can't run and gun like COD Almost everything about the game You can be/do pretty much anything in this game. Even a stupid mod that's highly popular called Atlis Life where you.. well... live life as an avatar.  Graphics are always a plus, if your computer can run it.  Bad: Even after a year of full release, it still has glitches. Fatigue system is a pain in the â¥â¥â¥, but realistic(ish)  It's plain and simple. If you love a legitimate military tactics, movement, feel over all, then this game is for you. The modding community is over the top and will release content for this till arma 5 comes out. (Notice I skipped arma 4, that's how dedicated people are to these games). If you like running and gunning.... you'll rage quit within the first day.  Highly recommended. Join us on EUTW 
2613	1	a	Superb quality military simulator. 10/10
1755	1	a	Probably one of my favorite shooters so far. The modded servers like Altis life, Battle Royale and Wasteland
1384	1	a	Arma 3 is a game that is at its best with friends and well made community missions.  -The single player campaign can be difficult for impatient players or someone who is generally 'bad', but a 'good' player will be able to get through it.  -The ingame editor is what gives Arma games the ability to endure, and allows new missions to be made or for weapon testing. However some scripting knowledge (even if its basic) is needed for more dynamic missions. But for some people, 70% of their time may be here.  -Multiplayer can be tricky if you can't find any descent servers to play on or don't know a single friend that is willing to play Arma often.  -The graphics when set to low-standard quality will not look half as good as any other mainstream FPS, but a computer with a descent graphics card and good cpu will have no problem (unless you take the settings to the extreme).  -The Upcoming DLCs and Expansion are hopefully going to add a nice amout of ingame content.  -The modding community itself acts as a hub of occasionally quality addons.  -Current problems that do still exist in Arma 3 however, area the AI; environmental damage physics; and a lack of diversity in each factions arsenal.  -Some pluses for the game are (as mentioned): the communities divotion to the series, the only other game I've personally seen with such a dedicated modding base recently is Skyrim. Another one of the points towards Arma 3 is the maps, not only are they massive in comparision to stock military games, but they also have similar amounts of detail where the developers saw fit. Finally, despite the occasional AI issues, the game really does give players a different experience everytime (once my friend and I fought valiantly against overwhelming odds and lost, we played again and won, again we got wiped immediatly, and again we saw the AI flip their IFV over which was funny (all on the same mission 'Combined Arms')).  *Old (Currently, Arma 3 is a 7/10 but depending on Bohemia's roadmap, Arma 'could' end with a 9/10.)  *New; After Bootcamp and with the Helicopters DLC about to be released (not to mention the Make Arma Not War entries) so far the game is moving along and becoming better as was intended and my score for it has risen from 7/10 to a 8/10.
1606	1	a	Great game for great gamers
4474	1	a	its like an army simulation its so real ! it might laggy at somme points but still a good game
5419	1	a	So many cool gamemodes to try out and have fun with your friends with!
3382	1	a	The only fps that allows you to run straight and look left and right! Thumbs up!  I downloaded Arma 3 to play the Breaking Point and Epoch mods. Both are great! Highlly Recommend!  
4900	1	a	THIS is an AWESOME game to play. The developer team is really caring about the community. The workshop and map editor helps you to do a LOT of things that no other games can. The hardward requirement is pretty high and you will not get the best experience if you can only run on low or medium. PLUS, if you one of those people who play COD or battlefield a lot, you may need a few hours to L2P this game. ARMA 3 is seriously an simulation game, any gun can pretty much 2 shot or 1 shot you at any distance(and the AI is pretty good at aiming). Stay in cover, move quick and you will enjoy this war on the island.
4643	0	a	the game is very fun to play with if you have a team or a squad of friends to play with, HOWEVER, this game is not worth (what it currently is) to buy. You still got the bugs like walking down steps and dying, dying from walking into a door, getting launched by rocks. The AI is still pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ compared to arma 2. Plus the damage system is â¥â¥â¥â¥ING HORRIBLE. The fact that you have to PAY to get marksman stuff is disgusting. Is bohemia turning into the next EA? Probably. Altough its a leap from arma 2 in graphics, Arma 2 was actually better IMO.   Basically it still has the same game breaking glitches that should have been fixed a long time ago. AI is still â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Damage system is â¥â¥â¥â¥. And the only things that they did right this time seems to be the ZEUS addition and the graphics.   TLDR: Bugs suck, p2w sucks, too much focus on graphics, zeus is probably the best thing

1583	1	a	the campaign was 'ok' there wasnt much to it it was very short and not that thrilling but i enjoyed it, multiplayer is pretty sweet admins on everyserver 24/7 keeps the t'kers away, combat mode is amazing compared to arma II new stances and deployment. i give it a 9.5/10
556	1	a	This game is awesome, buy it !!! 9/10
4167	1	a	GIVE ME A FRIENDS GIFT FOR THIS GAME PLEEEEASE 
2049	1	a	Leukemia Interactive
568	1	a	just waiting for a m8
4465	1	a	What's people complaining about? DLCs a rip off? Then don't buy the DLC. No one asked you too. But if you do want the DLC, then buy the dlc bundle if you have the game already. BUT if you don't have the game right now, buy the Extended Edition. (You can wait for a sale on that) This game is such an improvement over Arma 2. Graphics are better, physics are better, and now BIPODS. If the game isn't running nicely, you can go into the launcher and tweak the settings like adding more RAM for the game to use and how much cores.
539	1	a	A realistic Military Simulator, this game is worth a buy. With the ability to create your own missions with the amazing editor and to play others with the in-built workshop support, you can have endless hours of enjoyment with this game. It's quite realistic, but still lacks many features of military warfare that could be put into the game. The graphics ain't so good on my computer but that's because my computer is 8 years old and I will be upgrading soon so I will be able to see this game at it's full potential.  This was my first game in the Arma series, followed by Arma 2 (We don't speak of Cold War Assualt). From my experience with Arma 2 this game doen't differ enormously, bar graphics of course. However, it does have some features that are not present in Arma 2, and I frequently notice these features missing when playing Arma 2. If you are new to the Arma series get this game but if you are a long time veteran then maybe wait a little untill you get bored of all the mods on Arma 2.  This is a perfect game for any person who enjoys military combat games or would like a realistic simulation of military combat and life. Worth a buy in my opinion.  8/10  P.S. I haven't played a lot of this game at the current time because it doesn't run so well on my computer and I can only spawn a few units without intense framerate drops.
3676	1	a	Best open world war simulator and installing mods brings a whole new game for you to play
4041	1	a	The best military simulator! If you enjoy realism, run out and buy now!
1569	1	a	Best War-sim EVER. Great fun when u have a squad going :)
1704	1	a	please rudse the price of arma 3 to Â£24 again so i can buy it for all my mates arma 3 is so fun to play when you have got some friends on the game to its just greate i think everyone should buy it when it goes down price of coruse :D
2022	1	a	This game is one of my top 3, it is a realistic war simulator at its finest along with the many popular game modes such as altis life, king of the hill, and wasteland. The story is one of the best stories i have played in a long time and to put icing on the cake it was released in 2013. I dont even think i have to start on the maps, weapons, and vehicles. Even the 33 things about arma 3 video above cant go into detail without stretching the video to about 3 hours. 10/10 would play again
2420	1	a	Great
918	1	a	I wish I liked this game. It's a good game, yeah, but I just don't like it for some reason.
3427	1	a	Flying around in one of the jets showing off my 'Wonderful' skills, I'm flying about 10 meters above the ground trying to be cool, only to soon realize that I hit some electrical wires and died. Give Bohemia your F'in money!
3172	1	a	the best game i ever playd
2159	1	a	This game is so realistic i sometimes think im actually about to die!
1920	1	a	I look for maximum replayability and good mooding support in games and this one meets and even excedes these expectations. - Wide range of multiplayer modes and server types  You can play with you and a friend in co-op or in a massive player saturated server. - Easy access of mods  Downloading mods is a breeze with an easily accessable place to put and activate all of your mods. - Make and play your own missions and other's  With a easy to use mission editor, you can create the ideal battle to your liking.  In conclusion I rate this 9/10 - Would get ran over with a strider again.
4613	0	a	Bad game. Horrible game engine. System requirements for what? Nope company. Few models. Multiplayer always glitches. Waste of money.
2044	1	a	Best Game Ever I Love It 40 50 And 60FPS Fun As Hell 25/25 Stars Only Thing That Makes Me Mad Is You Got To Buy The Dlc Bundle To Play Zombies And Alits Life but its on sale for 10 bucks so no biggie so you better buy this while the steam summer sale is on for 20 bucks
2999	1	a	Probly best military simulation shooters you could buy with out going into a real combat zone. would recomend this game to anyone!
1756	1	a	This game requires skill, focus, and percision. This is what makes a game beautiful. A must buy!
563	1	a	600 Hours plus. Epic game.
3740	1	a	Pro: Mods Explosions Overwhelming Mods Guns More Mods Nice campaign story Still more mods Trolling 5 year olds who plays the game(rare) Beating the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of people in editor  Cons: Mods that take up half of your harddrives â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Miller.....   52351/10 Would shoot Kerry if he doesn't stop complaining again
1254	1	a	I love this game, spent many hours into various kinds of game modes from Alpha to release.   I have played many singleplayer maps which I have gotten from the Workshop, some I have spent countless of hours restarting over and over again, just to enjoy it a little bit more. and some I have played with my friends in various fun co-op missions.  I have played various multiplayer modes from Wasteland, King of the hill, to Altis Life. I have had my moments of rage, and I have had my crazy ammount of laughter.  If you like a good FPS game with a great ammount of depth and lots of replayability, then this is a game for you.  If you like to sit on a hill far away from the combat sniping down on the unknown enemy soldiers, then this is a game for you. If you enjoy commandering a group of troops, hell, even a whole army in battle, then this is a game for you. Or if you just want to do illegal drug business while avoiding cops in Altis Life, then this is a game for you. I feel repetive now, but I really enjoy this game, and hope you do so too.  Sorry if there is any grammatic errors in the text, english is not my native language.
2979	1	a	Got mugged because my car was blocking the road while I was getting mugged.  Would get mugged again/10
1477	1	a	Great gome to play with mates online and you have a thrilling singlr player too.
5271	1	a	Brilliant game, can use some Help though some bugs are annoying..
1078	1	a	Great game I love playing this with my friends really good graphics and good guns i would reconmend this game to your friends
5368	0	a	Why play Arma 3 when you could be putting your genitals into meat mincer which would be a lot more fun. I feel like Ive been robbed! Definitely not worth Â£35.99 -_-
1993	1	a	this game is a good game
3303	1	a	Very glad they had a free to play weekend, as well as an awesome weekend sale. Got into boot camp and being a hardcore battlefield player i was hooked immediately. wow, i'm looking forward to some really good tacatical game play with my friends.
3057	1	a	Not just the most realistic modern military combat simulator.  Play however you want to play.  I may not like your strange zombie survival fetish.  Or your weird ArmA streetracing when you can just go and buy an actual streetracing game.  But you can do it.
585	1	a	By far the best military sim out there!
956	1	a	Pros: Military sandbox game with great gunplay, projectile physics, and ballistics, a robust editor, and has a multitude of custom missions and mods, all of which allow for countless possibilities for infantry, vehicle, and combined operations.  Cons: Performance ranges from great to terrible and is arbitrary, awkward movement system in close quarters, and subpar hit detection at times when playing multiplayer.
1362	1	a	With the new Zeus DLC, I honestly think that the future of RTS is with this game. If you have the hardware to run the game its a must-buy, its the only pc game out there thats actually a full military simulator rather than run and gun fps.
2822	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing amazing! with all it's mods! 10/10 would buy again
2551	1	a	When playing singleplayer the game runs as it should on your average gaming rig, however when playing on multiplayer server even the most powerful machine can struggle running this game well.  On an i7 with a 980Ti, while playing KOTH on high settings I get an average of 25-40 FPS, though on other servers I can play on Ultra with 60 FPS; so it varies.  The gameplay itself is enjoyable, there are many game modes for you to choose from and I can easily see anyone buying this game getting at least 500 hours out of it.
965	1	a	Arma 3 brings back all of your favorite characters from the Arma 2!   Like army guy 1, 2, and 4.  The story is captivating and will keep you enthralled for hours.
1923	1	a	Played campaign Called to Kamino base for no reason Commander gets killed Base gets attacked Stranded in woods with friend Friend dies Walking through forest alone Find some Brit Navy dudes on the radio Walk around bad guys to other stranded guys Walking to Brit Navy boat Ambushed in forest One shotted from 600yds  10/10 would have John Marston AI aim and linear cliche campaign again
996	1	a	First impressions with the game. Download arma 3 check! Play singleplayer passed.. Go to multiplayer check! Find a sandbox server check! Spawn check! Buy a vehicle che....  'Wait a minute... What am i hearing outside of this building?'  Went to the door and as soon as i opened it i saw a frigging tank standing in front of me WITH RAINBOW COLORS!! Didnt have time to close the door and i ran in the other side of the building. I was terrified. I heard that the tank was circling around the building and i had no where to go.  finally i got out of the building and the thank started to chase me so i went back in. I bught uav and had no idea what to do with it. Well apparently i didnt do right thing with it cause i launched a missile while i was on the ground and blow up my uav, my friends uav and 50k helicoper.  After a while my friend came in the same building and he bought uav also. we hopped to the controls of that thing and my friend drove the uav right next to that tank and i launched the missile. Went to see what happened and i saw this tank upside down on the ground. Driver comes out shoots me in the back of my head and then i respawned.  10/10 would play again !
117	1	a	This game ruined my life
567	1	a	My in game hours is my review :D
4686	1	a	i cant even begin to say how fun this game is at first theres a huge learning curve but after u will have so much fun theres so many severs and game modes and great moments its fun solo and with friends i would buy again for 80 if your getting any sale its sooooo worth it and its one of the best games on steam 10/10 only regret is not getting sooner   ps cant spell
4300	1	a	Exceptional. 10/10  Pros: -Moddability -The game sounds amazing with mods (JSRS Dragonfyre, Blastcore Phoenix, TPW) -Much easier to play than ArmA 2 -Mobility and voice acting is much more fluid. You no longer walk like a tank. -The community (for ArmA 3 the way it was meant to be played, not the mods for it) is untarnished. -Simulator for many things. With further refining (mods), it could be a good armored combat/flight sim. -The game by itself looks absolutely gorgeous on ultra. The models are high-poly, the materials are great. With graphical mods (which aren't even needed), this game can unfathomably good, which is impressive for RV3. -Open world, multiple game modes and modifications available. -Mods give you ability to install maps instead of the CoD tactic of DLC map packs. -Zeus feature allows for dynamic scenario creation/multiplayer fun -Singleplayer content is massive. -Easy to create modifications -Combined arms modification is in depth and great.   Cons: -Unless you have a relatively top of the line computer, good luck running it on ultra. -Single thread usage is exceptionally poor with this game, much like ArmA 2 -DayZ community ruined the image of ArmA and its associates. -Children often play DayZ or Altis life or whatever have you. These kids go onto other servers (milsim/armored combat) and transfer the cancer of those communities to pure ArmA. -While bugs have been ironed out, many still do manifest themselves (often hilariously) -AI is still either really overpowered or really useless and dumb.  TLDR: get the game
3009	1	a	Fun and realistic combat simulator. Strong lurning curve but when you start to learn it, you can have alot of fun. I strongly recommend to people who like realistic games.
1608	1	a	i dont know why i like this game :|
4981	1	a	I've been running for an hour in this game
4764	1	a	I barely got this game and let me tell you I had the most terrifying experence ever (to me that is)  I just finished Basic Training and finally knew how to play and understand this game, I joined a King of the hill server with 103 people in the game. As i joined i bought the first gun given to you and went on, I marked where my objective was at and catched a ride from a fellow teammate flying a helicopter over to the objective. I introduced myself to him, He Introduced his name as well. His name was John, as we were waiting for more teammates to join us on the ride to the objective, We chatted about this war (Trying to RP Here and he joins me in RPing) As we were chatting he told me that he been playing this game for 769 hours now, and that he was going to quit soon. I told him i understood why, The helicopter was full now and we began to lift off and go to the objective. As we were going there we were shot at and began to crash everyone jumped off and was killed, Me and John were still inside the helicopter that was falling slowly He told me 'Jump, go now you â¥â¥â¥â¥er.' I jumped and made it into the ocean with a broken leg, I swam up as fast as i can, and saw the helicopter slowly fall and crash into the mountain side, and then exploded. I swam to shore quickly and patched my leg up and ran to crash. I found his dead body and said in chat 'RIP IN PIECES John.' i took his gun which was better then mine and ran to the battlefield. As i made it to the battle field, there were explosions, gunshots, Helicopters crashing and then exploding, and People dying right in front of me. I have indeed seen some â¥â¥â¥â¥, I saw a fellow soldier on the ground i asked if he was ok he replied' Does it look like im â¥â¥â¥â¥ing OK?'  'I'm crawling for â¥â¥â¥â¥s sake when i could be running at the hill and be taking it over.' I said 'Ok, ok here' I dropped a med kit and ran to the Hill we were suppose to take over.  I saw 3 enemies run pass me, i shot at them and killed 2. One of the enemies saw me and began to fire at me and shot at me chest once. I ran and the enemy followed. As i thought i was going to be found and then shot, I attempted to heal up but then he found me and was about to fire when 2 teammates came to me and killed the enemy.  I thanked them, healed up and ran to the belly of the beast. I met a teammate being shot at heavily and was wounded I told him to run to me, he told me he couldn't he was hurt and couldn't run. I threw a gernade at the area where all the enemies were shooting at and got a double kill but 2 enemies survived. He had time to run towards me and survive but as he tried to run towards me a Sniper got him in the leg and made him crawl, as he was about to die he told me to run, the sniper finished him off and hen payed attention to me. The sniper shot me injuring me and i began to crawl. 4 Enemies ran toward sme and all four shot at me. And i respawned. 10 out of 10, will get shot at by 4 people and wounded by a sniper again.
449	1	a	Arma 3 has a lot of detail when it comes to its graphics which is good but it can also have some bad points, Although it is realistic half the time you can't see your enemies because the sun is in your way.   A massive problem with Arma 3 is the AI, They are totally un-realistic i once used a sniper to shoot at an AI who took cover on the ground and as it was long distance i missed using a sniper, He stood up and returned fire hitting me with about 3 of his 4 shots. At the distance he shot at it would be impossible with an assault rifle.  I've never really found ArmA as a game i would play by myself because it becomes boring and repetitive especially when you keep dying and most of the game consists of travelling to the battle. I like ArmA 3 and i would suggest it to everbody because you can have some good times on it. But the game itself needs to have a lot of work for it to be a game i would consistantly play.
760	1	a	Arma 3 is immersive: as one of the best (if not THE best) military simulators on the market, A3 surrounds you in a variety of breath-taking environments and puts you in the center of the action. You'll receive radio transmissions through bursts of static, hear the wind go by, feel the ground shake when a tank rolls by. Everything from the weather and lighting down to the recoil of the gun in your hand is so finely tuned and detailed, that the only closer you could get to realism is to enlist.   Arma 3 is dynamic: it has an arsenal of mods just waiting to alter the game a little more one way or another. With a community thriving on creating more and more for the game, the sky is the limit for what can be done. No two missions will ever be repeated the same way. AI learn and adapt to situations, forcing you to do the same or die, and with a fully destructible environment, nowhere is safe until the enemy are all dead.   Arma 3 is intense: you'll know this when you hear the bullets snap past your head and you're holding your dead teammate in your arms. The smallest firefights can shift the course of an entire battle. Life or death can be determined just from which way you decide to lean. Teamwork is tantamount to success, and unlike many modern shooters, there are no 'lone wolf heroes', no one guy rushing the enemy line and winning the game for everyone. You work together or you die. There is no third option.   Arma 3 is the game you want when nothing but the best will do.
5264	1	a	It's the dead of night on the CSAT-occupied island of Stratis, and the peaceful darkness is about to explode into chaos. I'm leading one of two spec-ops teams on a mission to liberate the leader of a local guerrilla faction and return him to the much larger island of Altis. A British squad is in charge of the actual rescue. Our job is to cause as much trouble across the island as possible to distract the CSAT forces and give the British the opening they need.  Over the next hour, that's precisely what I do. Inserting by boat from the northwest coast, I head south and raid an ammo dump before cutting across to the eastern shore to destroy a heliport. Then my squad suppresses an enemy encampment from a hillside near the centre of the island as I swoop in from the west to flank them. Yet before we can regroup, my entire team is killed by reinforcements descending from the north, and the British still need more time to complete their mission. Alone, I rush to the southernmost tip of the island, where I blow up a fortified anti-air position before escaping by riding a quad bike back through the swarming enemy forces to the extraction point, where the boat takes me home.  Arguably the biggest complaint about Bohemia Interactive's post-Flashpoint games is that their campaigns haven't used the magnificent landscapes they create to their full potential. The first Arma's campaign was a hastily cobbled-together disappointment, while it took a certain zombie-survival mod to harness the austere and foreboding power of Arma 2's Chernarus. That Arma 3 uses half an island for just one of its twenty-odd missions is indicative of Bohemia's effort to resolve this ongoing issue. Indeed, taken as a whole, Arma 3 strives to make this deep and impenetrable military simulator series a more comprehensive, more engaging and more user-friendly experience. It isn't completely successful, but I had an awful lot of fun watching it try.  While Arma 3 was officially released back in September, the campaign has been portioned out in three substantial chunks over the last six months. Each chapter is a self-contained entity with its own story arc and theme; combined, they tell the tale of the excitingly named Corporal Ben Kerry and his role in the war over the fictional Mediterranean island archipelago of Altis and Stratis, waged between four different factions.  The first part, Survive, is geared towards introducing players to Arma. It takes place entirely on the smaller of Arma 3's two islands, Stratis, and sees Kerry banding up with a group of NATO survivors after the local Altian Armed Forces, backed by NATO's eastern equivalent CSAT, rise up against the local US garrison. For the most part, missions are small-scale skirmishes that keep you firmly in the 'follower' category while teaching you the basics of minimising your daily lead intake. Rescuing a downed helicopter crew instructs you on establishing a defensive position, while a midnight liaison with local militia explains how to flank and clear buildings.  It's hardly the campaign's most spectacular stage. Story-wise, it's let down by voice acting that ranges from passable to cringeworthy and a script that understands military radio chatter but not how human beings interact with one another. Even here, though, Bohemia's approach to maximising the assets it has built is apparent. Missions are nearly always multi-staged, with objectives being added and changed as events rarely go according to plan.  While it smoulders rather than sparks, Survive concludes strongly and the momentum is carried over into Adapt, definitely the best of the three chapters. This introduces Altis, a masterwork of environmental design. I could write another 1000 words on its remarkable sights and sounds: its misty dawns, crimson dusks and streetlight-speckled nights. But what's most important is how the detail that's gone into mapping the landscape's undulations - the lumps and bumps, hills and valleys - plays into the game's combat. A little rise in the ground might be the difference between life and death as you throw yourself down in evasion of the fiendishly accurate enemy AI. When they stop to reload, you'll rush to locate a better vantage point, order your men to 'find cover' (an extremely handy new command) and plant half a dozen bullets in your opponent's surprisingly tough body.  Tactics are vital in Arma 3, but it's terrain that really makes the difference between success and failure. It's crucial to learn this before Adapt begins, because the difficulty suddenly ramps up. The first mission sees you alone, unarmed and with a city full of enemy soldiers between you and any kind of safety. At this point, setting saves to unlimited using Arma's highly customisable difficulty levels becomes a necessity. Fittingly, after Survive, you will die many, many times. That said, it's important to note that combat is more satisfying than before thanks to improved animations, smoother weapon handling and better optics - meaning the challenge stems from your opponents rather than clumsy controls and slow-to-aim weapons.  Adapt also changes the way you play. It gives you a squad to control, which is a mixed blessing. AI units tend to be much more perceptive of enemy locations than you are and are especially useful when facing down tanks and APCs, but they also require a fair amount of babysitting to keep them alive, and the lack of changes to Arma's squad commands means this can be a chore. Especially problematic is AI ammo management; your teammates go through bullets like a swarm of locusts through a corn crop, and resupplying them in the field is a nightmare in Arma 3's clumsy interface.  Alongside its story missions, which include the brilliant raid on Stratis described above, Adapt also introduces an open-world component. From your base you can go out on 'Patrol' and complete multiple optional objectives, from clearing enemy checkpoints to smoking out a sniper hidden inside a labyrinthine industrial complex, all while collecting weapons, ammo and equipment to use during the main missions - though the clunkiness of Arma's inventory management means this is less enjoyable than it should be. If you want to bring stuff back to base, you need to find a vehicle and load it item-by-item from your own inventory, while before each mission the game defaults to a standard equipment loadout and items you previously had can be lost in this process.  After the meatiness of Adapt, the final chapter Win feels fleeting by comparison, with only six missions to its name. But they're also the most spectacular, displaying vast, combined-arms battles that cover sweeping areas of Altis. It's strongly reminiscent of the opening of Operation Flashpoint, but with you in control rather than being led by an AI squad leader. In these closing stages you can call in devastating artillery strikes and helicopter assaults, simultaneously demonstrating the sheer destructive power of modern warfare and your own insignificance in the scale of things. Story-wise, it's also the most interesting segment, making unsettling use of its near-future setting and offering a branching conclusion that is fascinating, whichever direction you take.  Arma 3's campaign is a big, powerful, deeply engrossing thing, but there is one disappointment: its lack of vehicular missions. Since the story focuses on one not particularly interesting character who is ultimately a grunt, there are no tank missions, no helicopter missions and no jet missions. I can understand why, to a point: Arma's vehicles, especially its airborne offering, take time and effort to learn to control. Moreover, in these kinds of games infantry combat tends to be more enjoyable anyway. On the other hand, Flashpoint offered plenty of vehicle engagements during its campaign without any issue, and it's frustrating that, 13 years on, Arma's campaigns still lag behind it in terms of breadth of experience.  8/10
3759	1	a	Played a bunch of Arma 2 when it came out, finally got the money for this and i love it
702	1	a	Very good game, Fun to play with mate especially on life servers definetly recommend this game.
1053	1	a	This game is hard core with many game modes that give me the chance to express my interest and special needs.This game will only get better with time like aged chesse or a fine wine....
2939	1	a	Went full speed down a mountain, crashed into a tree, and I exploded into pieces. 12/10 its okay.
844	1	a	5/5
1929	1	a	The rolling hills lay majestically in front of us. On my right was my brother, eager to eliminate enemies. On my left was my best friend, scanning the area for vehicles. Behind me was our squad of 5, awaiting my command. I looked forward and spotted an enemy squad making their way towards us. I crouched and whispered 'Enemy Spotted'. I was not going to lose a man today. I would get them out. I would escape from Stratis.
1025	1	a	the main story can be really hard as it is very realistic so you can die in a few shots. but the mods are SO FUN !  9/10
261	1	a	Probably the closest thing that us, the general population, has towards a realistic military simulator/game.  I suggest that you do not buy this if you are expecting a linear fast paced action game like CoD or Battlefield, this is much more in-depth then that. This is not simply, running around 360 no scoping people. Squad Managment and effective communication is necessary. There is also something that you can't experience in the said titles above, which is long-range combat.  (An example of this is preforming an assault on a base/camp with armor, artillery and other assests from varying distances from your own base.  However, this is still a game and should be taken lightly from time to time. I suggest learning how to do tricks in the littlebird (MH9-Hummingbird) and exploiting the terrible physics.   This game has multiple different gamemodes and tasks that could be simulated. So you'll never have the same experience twice.   Pros: -Very Realistic. -Great Graphics (If you can run them). -Interactive Environment. -Realisitc Vehicals (Most of the time). ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Cons: -Physics (You will hear 'Arma Physics' referred to multiple times). -Muliplayer Optimization. -Very steep learning curve but you will appreciate it over time. (More of a learn as you play) -Occasional Crashing. -Controls will more than likely conflict your normal keyboard setup, I suggest using the Arma 2 setup.   Overall 10/10  Even if you don't think this is for you, trust me, the teamwork involved in this game is beyond amazing, the amount of co-op I've played counts for 95% of my game time. I've met tons of new people from this and they're like family to me.
3344	1	a	Yes in very good fun
3729	1	a	You wont get bored of this game. There's just too much to do. You need a fairly decent PC to play some of the large multiplayer servers but it's no big deal. I've had a blast on this game and I plan to for a long time. Recommend this to anyone looking for lots of fun and some very weird and unique people. Roleplay, Battle Royale [Hunger Games], Wasteland &amp; King Of The Hill are just some of the amazing game modes.   That's all.
3414	1	a	Fun Fun and more Fun get a play with me !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3477	1	a	Another great game in the arma seris, keep it up Bohemia because I'm not tired of this yet! 9/10
3220	1	a	This is a good game but if you do not have a trusty computer it might crash alot or lag so look at some reveiws to see what GC is good for it 
1673	1	a	Wow, what a game. I started playing this having no idea what to do, now I get paid $200 to make fully functioning gearscripts. It's amazing! If you would like to learn more about how I got sexually assaulted, please check out this game on steam!
4637	1	a	I realistic military simulator based on the island of Altis and Stratis.  There is a campaign and multiplayer. The campaign is not that interesting since the multiplayer is where it's all at.  You can play gamemodes such as King of The Hill, Wasteland, Battle Royale and Life Mods.  This is not a fast paced game. You can not just run up to building expecting to kill someone. You have to slowly advance and make sure you are not going to get shot at if you were to stand up.  Shooting is really difficult, if you stand up, it is nearly impossible to aim, crouching is easier and going prone is very easy to aim with.  The game has a virtual Linux and Mac port, meaning it is not a native port. All though, the performance is nearly identical to Windows. The port is an open beta and may be discontinued if the developers feel there is no reason to maintain it. There is no Battleye (Anti-Cheat) workshop scenario support (crashes on start) with this port and the game is slightly outdated. Meaning that servers running on Windows PCs (using the latest version) will not be able to play with Linux and Mac users, sadly. I really wish they go on with this port.
2823	1	a	AMD is for â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
3338	1	a	Mod's. Mod's. The things that make the game good. Oh and did I bring up the part where there selling us DLC Just to add some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ go-karts and some half â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ helis? Well yeah. â¥â¥â¥â¥ off with DLC and just leave us alone. 'You MUST buy the DLC to use this go-kart' Are you â¥â¥â¥â¥ing kidding me?
5019	1	a	Cant stop playing!
5272	1	a	The Game does have some pretty minor glitches but other than that Arma 3 is a great game for community development. Dev's out there create some pretty fantastic mods and addons for the games because of the huge open world maps and functions Bohemia Interactive provides in Arma 3. Many people buy this game just for the AMAZING addons to the game which allow very unpredictable scenarios to happen. Arma is Intriguing to me because the game is UNPREDICTABLE. Games that are unpredictable are more of a way for players to choose how they play and gives a slight immersion. There can be scenarios where you see a heli crash onto a building which is 100 meters away and that building had one of your best soldiers now knocked out waiting to ambush the enemy who is surrounded with OPFOR. What do you do? Arma is fantastic because its your choice of how you want to play the game where other games have straight up orders to do stuff, why would you want to do that? I would give this game a 9/10
3177	1	a	Really good game, recommend for you to buy it. The game has extremely good graphics that make it look realistic. Once the game is out of Alpha/Beta, there will be a lot more vehicles such as airplanes. I would give this game a rating of 8.5/10 as of now.
1602	1	a	I find myself at a loss for words when I attempt to describe the feelings and emotions I encounter when I reminisce of my early days of playing Arma 3. First, before I pass my worthy judgement, Iâd like to preface this review with the fact that I was totally new to the FPS and shooter genre upon purchasing Arma 3. I have never played CS:GO in my life. In fact, Iâve played very few FPS in my life. I dove into Arma totally unaware of the steep learning curve. Most of all, I purchased the game without realizing that this title would affect my perspective on PC gaming as a whole.  Arma 3 is a beautiful game. It encompasses the rush of a multiplayer FPS, the adventure of a creative sandbox, the strategy of a hardcore simulation, and a deep love for teamwork in one graphically magnificent open-world masterpiece. Iâm not going to mention multiplayer teamwork in this review for the sake of the reader, as itâs something you have to experience yourself, and something I could talk about all day.  While Arma 3 is an amazing game, I discourage those who are faint of specs to steer clear of this-- at times-- just as taxing on your rig as on your wits.  I can go on and on about Arma 3, and still have something new to share. Like the classic Skyrim, you find something new in Arma 3 every day. If you want a game where victory and achievement is spoonfed to you, I discourage you from purchasing this costly concoction.   But if you prefer a difficult, cinematic, challenging, realistic, heart pounding, PTSD instilling war simulator? Welcome home. This is War. This is Arma 3.
939	1	a	Realistic coop/multiplayer game and singleplayer offcourse, I can already tell that this game is based on teamwork and it's awesome. good job bohemia!
2954	1	a	The greatest military sandbox I have ever played, Arma 3 is a lovingly crafted game, giving you an endless amount of scenerios to enjoy.   Singleplayer gives you the option to screw around with the editor and either create the insane or the epic. It's a challenge to learn but well worth it. The main campaign can be frustrating at times, but overall is a very excellent experience. User-made content and scenerios add another layer of depth, and Zeus gives an easy integration of that and multiplayer.    Multiplayer is by far the strongest point of the game, giving an in-depth experience in many a situation. You can play it as a roleplayer, joining Life servers. You can be a survivor of the wastes in Wasteland, or you can join in many user-made situations. The greatest of the options, however, is proper, team-based objective gameplay. With the right men, squads can work together to accomplish tasks against insurmountable odds. It gives a very strong sense of satisfaction to be part of such a team, and finishing the mission only solidifies that feeling.  If you want a very-well made military simulator, offering wonderful graphics, processor-melting situations, teamwork, tension and combined-warfare operation, Arma 3 is for you.
4942	1	a	you should buy it    Yankee Oscar Lima Oscar
3397	1	a	it should be on mac aswell
1544	1	a	The closest you can get to a battlefield without putting yourself in danger.
2045	1	a	Framerate drops faster than old people with polio
4017	1	a	Let's just say it's awesome 
2877	1	a	Most realistic game ever.
2407	1	a	Best tactical shooter our there!
5070	1	a	Good game snipped my life away from reality now i dont go outside 8/10
4876	1	a	Visual Quality - 10 (Outstanding) Gameplay Mechanics - 9 (This may not feel like your average first person shooter.. Slower paced then most mainstream shooters, The controls feel solid and actually shooting someone feels increasingly satisfying. Also the game will slowly force you into using a more planned and strategic tactic when facing your target, as using the 'Run &amp; Gun' tactic will get you killed in this War simulator.) Multiplayer - 6.5 (Poor Performance drives away the whole experience.) Sound - 8 (Although clumsy at times, Some sound effects may postively enhance your experience.)  I would definately recommend this game.
586	1	a	Walking through the countryside, hitching a ride on a helicopter for 10 minutes, and a whole lot of nothing happening all the time. Just like real life, 10/10 would wander pointlessly for 2 hours again.
4527	0	a	Do people REALLY accept the price of that DLC??? I can't accept that price not what so ever until I'm provided more than enough reason to.  Love the game though. Bugs suck so much but meh whats given is pretty awesome.
2403	1	a	For some reason, i get up in the morning while there is sun outside.  When im done playing its and look out of my window again, its always really late at night for some reason
5294	1	a	Kids play Call of Duty  Boys play Battlefield  Men play Arma
99	1	a	only realistic military sim where you don't have to wear pants  11/10 would be pantsless again

46	1	a	Brilliant Game. Brilliant Bundle. Played 3 through my childhood before I had steam and now I have this collection I have once again logged many hours on this awesome game!
4061	1	a	Bohemia Interactive's Arma 3 is the lastest iteration of a long-running series of realistic military sandbox titles, where the common themes have consistently centred upon player freedom, flexibility of action and movement, an expansive open world setting, an impressive degree of virtual realism and a passionate player community.   Set in the near future, Arma 3 presents the player with the sprawling, high-fidelity terrain of Altis, a war-torn Mediterranean island in the Agean Sea caught up in the building tensions between NATO and the growing influence of an eastern military alliance known as CSAT. This simmering geopolitical state of play serves as the core backdrop to the title's 3-part singleplayer campaign and persists as the central theme and justification of the game's simulated conflict.    The island of Altis itself is an immense, detailed and truly immersive canvas upon which the player is free to realise practically any military scenario of their imagining; where the journey from point A to point B can easily encompass many kilometres and where topography and geographic features can collude to radically alter player tactics. Based loosely upon the real island of Lemnos, Altis is able to achieve a uniquely natural feel to its coasts, rolling hills and forests and stands as a great testament to the skill and dedication of Bohemia interactive's map designers. Even while pinned under withering enemy fire, one cannot help but be struck by its beauty and authenticity.    Arma 3 also offers up a plethora of near-future military hardware; from various firearms, transports, logistical supports, infantry fighting vehicles, main battle tanks, helicopters as well as fighter jets and boats. The assets are generally very well modelled with distinct individual characteristics which make driving a quadbike a very different experience from that of a lumbering metal behemoth. While the helicopter flight dynamics are driven by Bohemia's optional, challenging but immensely rewarding advanced flight model, fixed-wing aircraft in Arma 3 remain the begrudging recipients of a comparatively rudimentary flight model that is perhaps a reflection of the series' traditional focus on ground-centric gameplay.   Given the near future setting, it is pertinent to note that much of the title's military assets are modelled upon real-life prototype weaponry, as well as a few present day variations met with a degree of developer artistic licence and fabricated designations. This notable departure from the well-established and popular modern day armaments that featured so prominently within previous titles in the series is undoubtedly a bold move by Bohemia, and one that still remains a divisive point of discussion within the player community.   The sounds of Arma 3, traditionally a less impressive facet of previous titles in the series, has undergone a marked improvement in this latest offering. Sustained post-launch updates to sound attenuation, super-sonic bullet cracks along a general reboot of the veracity of weapon fire in general have improved Arma 3's soundscape immeasurably, ensuring that the aural experience of its virtual warfare remains an authentic, often terrifying but ultimately satisfying assault upon the senses.    Arma 3 also comes bundled with an incredibly powerful mission editing suite which places the player in complete control of the entirety of the game's imposing asset list. It is in this mode, perhaps more so than any other where the title truly shines as a sandbox experience. With a little practice and experimentation, the player is able to construct fully realised military scenarios of varying complexity, for themselves, their friends or the community at large with objectives limited only by the bounds of the author's imagination. This uninhibited freedom, a cornerstone of the series, remains wonderfully present within Arma 3's core offering.     It would be almost criminally irresponsible to discuss Bohemia's flagship franchise without a brief mention of Arma's imperious modding community and the staggering host of improvements, fixes, overhauls and tweaks that this vibrant collection of talented indivduals provides. Whether one seeks to reintroduce real-life armies and modern-day weapon sets to their virtual arsenal, to aquaint oneself with a fresh new terrain upon which to wage war, or to apply a simple yet powerful overhaul to realism, the impressive array of user-made mods make this possible. Player created content has persisted as an important keystone of the series' appeal and longevity since its debut and continues to form an integral part of Arma 3's broader experience.    Players new to the series may find themselves understandably intimidated by the sheer bredth and depth of the content on offer, not to mention some of the more unforgiving aspects of the simulation. Thankfully Boehemia Interactive have introduced a host of means to facilitate the familiarisation process in the form of an in-game field manual and hint system, an introductory campaign, a Tron-esque virtual reality terrain and even providing the means for more experienced players to act as 'drill instructors' to teach newer players the ropes online. While a handful of frustrating AI, user interface, animation and optimisation/stability querks persist, Bohemia Interactive have created what is easily the most accessible title in the franchise to date.     As a reflection of Arma 3's flexibility, this is a title that has come to mean many different things to its expansive playerbase and one that can be played in a huge variety of different modes and playstyles. As a result Arma 3, perhaps more so than any previous iteration in the series, has seemed to grapple increasingly with the fallout of its own versatility. Attempting to establish a consensus on exactly how the game 'should be played' has become an increasingly tenuous prospect and one that is arguably unnecessary.    In the creation of Arma 3, Bohemia Interactive has taken upon the unenviable task of treading the fine middle-ground that exists between sustaining the high degree of realism that the series is famous for, while attempting to preserve fun and engaging gameplay for newcomers or those unacclimatised to a realistic simulation experience. 'Realism' itself, has proven to be an immensely subjective term within a virtual setting, and one that invariably means vastly different things to different players. The finer points of the title's realism with respect to certain game features remains a continual point of contention within the player community and one that appears unlikely to abate any time soon.    Arma 3's greatest triumphs then are to be found in its versatility and impressive open-world gameplay. Players are offered near total freedom, a staggering choice of armament, and a mandate to pursue their objectives however they see fit employing tactics entirely of their own design. This is a hugely layered and expansive sandbox title offering the player a unique gameplay experience and a gaming platform that has earned the rightful praise of many loyal fans.
3096	1	a	With mod tools, lean, serious communities supported by dedicated servers, Arma 3 will satisfy veteran PC gamers used to all the amenities that so many franchises dropped, because the game stays true to its roots yet innovates in such a way that expands the possibilities, but does not limits them.
916	1	a	It's a pretty, and awesome game, highly recomend it!
3037	1	a	this is a good game and had alot of fu with it +100000000000000000 should get it 
5094	0	a	UPDATE 07/06/2014  I was a big fan of OFP. I am playing 'this' game since literally 2002. I was hoping that developers will take it to a completely new level, not only graphics wise, but also improve and sophisticate its Simulation part.  That didn't happen. Instead, what we have now as ArmA III is simply an OFP converted to COD/BF/CS:GO. This game is dead, and not worth spending a dime on it.   PROS + Improved graphics, soldier equipment is detailed + Improved movement features, leaning, several sitting positions etc. + Bullet ballistics + Big areas available for play as an Islands  CONS - Horrible and non realistic human damage system (aka CS-like) - Fictional and not practically realistic weapons - Helicopter can lift and carry a heavy MBT while it is using its main gun in the air... - Sniper can shoot a person sitting inside armed IFV... - Aircraft/Helicopter simulation is at the PS2 arcade flying sim level... - Tank/Vehicle control is simply W A S D + Mouse click, horribly simplified - Vehicle movement on a terrain is a joke, totally screwed up physics - Helicopter can lift 5 ton truck, drop it from 10m and truck continues to drive normally... - Flying physics for Aircrafts/helicopters is a laughable joke - Shooting enemy Aircraft with AA Vehicle is all about 'button-press-hold-click' - TONS of bugs without attention.  I do not see a value in this game.  Developers should have been fixing the above issues and improving our gaming experience, instead, those clowns spend time on releasing trash like KARTS in order to suck additional buck from us!   KISS MY A$$ BOHEMIA!
2943	1	a	Authentic.
4793	1	a	Very hardcore game for anybody who likes Mil Sims as much as I do, although, if you are nto used to the ARMA series I do not reccomend it to you, there are so many controls to remeber but you can still learn them! Def a 10/10 game
3812	1	a	the most realistic war game ever
5234	0	a	this is a good game but it is so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing bad its just horrible falling out of buildings cant aim and walk out a door way sometimes you will just randomly died will just say you died its just a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥ take dont buy.
4377	1	a	You can shoot fish while scuba diving. 11/10 Best Call of Duty
2381	1	a	A true military simulator for the skilled player. If you enjoy FPS games like COD and Battlefield but want to take a step up into the real gaming world, this is your' game!
4021	1	a	10/10 would play again 
3570	1	a	This game is a different breed. For both the positives and negatives that brings with it, this game is truly a different breed.  I can easily say the best times I've had playing a video game have been in this game. Those times don't come easy though, and most videos don't do those times justice. Arma 3 is full of quailty people, but as it's seen significant growth, also growing amounts of trolls and not-so-friendly players. If you can find a group of players with a similar mindset and enough talent, you will have a fantastically unique time in this game.  Unlike most mainstream shooters, this game is almost entirely community based. Sure, Arma 3 itself is controlled and developed by Bohemia, but once you get in-game you are most likely playing a creation of another player. This completely opened ended sandbox of opportunities also has it's downsides though.  For one, performance isn't top notch. The game doesn't perform horribly in most cases, but a poorly scripted mission may lead to a drastic FPS decrease. Networked play will opperate fine under vanilla or well-created missions on a beefy server, but adding in a lot of players and custom scripts will quickly lead to major, annoying dsync.   The creative freedom in this game also means that expecting to launch the game, join any open server, and bunker down for some fun isn't a realistic expectation. A vast majority of the servers are community operated, meaning there are some very good and very poor servers. Apart from the diversity in game modes (a positive element), many of the same game modes (or missions) are modified by their respective server owners. This could mean some extra goodies, or some unexpectedly low FPS.  For all the negatives this game has, the positive elements will easily and repeated lead me to highly recommend this game. Just know what you're signing up for before purchasing ;)
3086	1	a	This game is:  C ool A amazing N ew C reative E ducational and R ad!!
3401	1	a	Singleplayer: 74 fps. Multiplayer: -12312424 fps. bohemia in a nutshell.
3694	1	a	Drove a car at 65 mph straight into a tree, car blew up and the tree survived.  10/10

3833	1	a	love this game there is never a time where i dont know what to do
1331	1	a	Very fun, tactical, realistic game. Multiplayer is nice, varitey of gamemodes. Singleplayer is always fun and has a nice storyline! I'd reccomend this to anybody who is thinking about getting Arma 3! Really looking forward to future updates and enhancements! Nice one again Bohemia!
613	1	a	Arma 3 is a game that everyone needs to try because once you try it you never go back :P
4585	1	a	~ DO NOT READ IF YOU'RE HERE FOR AN ARMA LIFE REVIEW ~  Arma 3 is a great game. Although it can be hard to enjoy it when you are constantly playing on domination servers with frustrating teammates. That is why it is important for the players who are interested in the tactical, militaristic simulator Arma is meant to be that they get in touch with the many groups out there. I was so bored on Arma until I found my group, now I actually play with a group who know each other by name and don't just mouth you all the time.   + Great Game, Highly recommend! + Huge amount of mods to improve gameplay + Amazing private communities!!!!! +MODS &amp; MAPS +Mods lol   - Vanilla AI are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ - Public servers can be frustrating with noob pilots and high pitched children.
3054	1	a	This game is gorgeous. I love it. Get it as soon as you can!
1325	1	a	A fantastic military sim which is only restricted by your imagination.
2974	1	a	This is war! If you like military simulation games this is worth your money.
627	1	a	This is what PCmasterrace is all about endless mods and maps the MP content you can create on your own is endless, 10/10 would ARMA all day
1518	1	a	You can â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ foot around with 13 year olds that want to do your mom when playing CoD or Battlefield games. When you want to step up to a man's FPS, strap yourself in to Arma 2 or 3, and join an Arma community. Be treated like a man.
1010	1	a	Great game! Worth it if you can get it on sale!
2322	1	a	OMG. When I need to rub one out, I play Arma III. Seriously... I beat my meat like it owes me money while driving the vehicles.   Also, this is a good game.
2091	1	a	get this game! And the Breaking Point mod for it!
4471	1	a	great game my friends need this game fun to play with a bunch of people
576	0	a	I played this game back when it was the free game for the weekend. I never purchased it afterwards, and you'll probably figure out why from both my review and those of others.   So, as anyone could reasonably expect, I was pretty excited for this game to be free for the weekend, as I've had my eye on it for almost a year! As an avid ARMA II fan, I had always been a little dissapointed with the lack of more modern military tech in an otherwise great game. I thought ARMA 3 would whisk all my problems away and carry me into ARMA heaven. It didn't quite work out like that though...  So upon launch the first thing that struck me as odd was the lack of info. Sure, the menus are much more appealing to the eye, but the tutorials were some weird lovechild of a campaign and a quest-system. It was very strange, so much so that I neglected to finish the first one. 'Oh well,' I thought. 'I've played enough ARMA II to figure out how to handle myself.'  And for the most part I was right. I jumped into the campaign and it was fun! So why the negative review? Well, the campaign was fun for a little bit, but after that 'new game smell' wore off, it wasn't much to brag about. I moved on, and played some tank match which I can't remember too many details about, other than a few key things. First off, everything was insanely grey. Now I understand the use of dynamic lighting and warzone fog and stuff like that, but this was just rediculous. So, as I was cruising around with my platoon of Slammers, we encountered some enemies! Great! Let's see how this works! So to sum that up, there's unique and dynamic damaged/dead unit models depending on their style of demise, the radio chatter no longer sounds like a panicking android but a much cleaner soldier, and vehicle control is no longer a reinactment of the mountain scene in Tokyo Drift.  But, what I couldn't get over was the lack of diversity. Oh look, Slammers. Hey, more slammers. Oh, a Wolverine (I think). And OMG another slammer. What I'm getting at is that, unlike its predicessor, ARMA 3 has no vast, game-changing DLCs (other than Karts, but that isn't even military.) So what you end up with is this massive tropical island turned warzone, and you get the same handful of units over and over, which might not matter for AIs, but for myself I prefer a diverse choice in my vehicles and other wartime equipment. Sure, it's modable, but so was ARMA II, and I already know the cool mods for that, which totally redefine the feel of the game.  So, over all:  +Better lighting and physics  +Better voices and immersion  +Diverse factions  +Newer tech to toy around with   -Low diversity of units  -Poor tutorials for those who want to start at the top  -Modernized EVERYTHING, even when unnecessary (e.g. Hummingbirds. It's such a pointles change, just give me my Little Bird!!)  -Virtually no DLCs that expand the battle experience, and the ones that exist aren't worth the cost for the amount of units recieved  -Essentially a more stabil version of a modded ARMA II client   Overall, I would just reccomend saving the money for other stuff, there's plenty of games on steam, but none of them, not even ARMA 3, can match the charm and pure flexibility of ARMA II.
3200	1	a	Modding community for it is great. Plenty of game modes so you'll never get bored. Bohemia is constantly updating it (though oftentimes their updates fix one thing but break something else)
1645	1	a	Great game. Best if played online with proper teammates. Very realistic, so it needs some time to get readjusted from COD and similar other games.
3661	1	a	Hands down best game on steam.
4670	1	a	Arma 3 Is Great!!!!  Let me just start by saying are you sick of the troll kiddies running around with the cheapest weapons and using an auto aim assist and killing you right away? I know i am. This game Gives you an immense feel for war and keeps you thinking constantly. Sometimes the Action is spaced out quiet a bit but when the battle hits it is the gaming moments that stay with you forever. Plus Getting that mega kill is something to actually be proud of with your skill and not just stupid luck.
858	1	a	I went from shooting a guy in the head to racing around in gokarts with machineguns attached to them. 10/10 would play again
4472	1	a	Dear beiber fan _69,  Here my love xoxoxoxoxo HB  sort yo ping den wees play togeth  gg gg gg gg gg gg gg gg gg gg gg   Lov Dirty mike and the boys   - Trev   Thanks bro for this Amazing game  and the Review: this game is amazing, smooth engine, great missions, a nice step up from arma 2, Downside: multiplayer is to time consuming. qq
5022	1	a	Absolutely fantastic and never played before game. This game is a beast! I recommend this game with 9/10 Stars
3160	1	a	Awesome game, I bought it for the life servers like Altis life and Arma 3 life and servers like that because thats what I find the most fun. Definitely recommend it 100%!
3831	1	a	A cheaper and longer lasting GF replacement.
712	1	a	Just buy this game + DLC pack. It's all you'll need for the rest of your natural life! And before you even get started, know that you'll need to learn all the bugs, as they are features of the game. But seriously, if you like shooting things, and realism appeals to you over arcadism, and especially if you like scripting, making objects or other game content, this game is so versetaile that it should keep you busy for a long time.
4386	1	a	I've never played this game before.
147	1	a	Walked into a table, died.  Would recommend.
1448	1	a	Definitely a step up from ArmA 2
1998	1	a	Legend has it, you can hear your computer scream as you play
3299	1	a	And outstanding multiplayer sandbox game that is so addictive !!! got me playing nothing else :D.... Amazing game &lt;3
1710	1	a	This game is great but I never want to play it because it runs at 12 frames on all of my friends' computers (most of them are better than mine)
4160	1	a	Best war game ever, its that simple.
1747	1	a	Fantastic but real, hardcore but awesome!
3459	1	a	Having owned this since the alpha, I can say I highly recommend it. This beautiful game brings not only fantastic single and multiplayer modes, but stunning graphics as well. It has a much better optimization than Arma 2, but is also more graphically intensive due to being a newer game. Modding community is very developed and mods are plentiful. Breaking point mod highly recomended for those who enjoy DayZ. All together an amazing game and a huge step-up from Arma 2.
178	1	a	Democracy Implementation Simulator 2016 10/10
2259	1	a	Bought it a few days ago, Now I have 136 hours of play time. If you value friendships your going to need to not to they will dwindle if you get into this game which it is very easy to as there is ALOT of content.
4168	1	a	One of the better games (if not THE best) on my list in which you have complete and absolute freedom. The editor itself is a very fun feature and you can do practically whatever, as long as you dedicate some time to learning how to script or the syntax, or whatever. In any case, an amazing game which I truly enjoy playing with others co-operatively, but also PvP. The combat is fun, somewhat simple, but surely adrenaline-pumping and full of action. If you're playing with the right people, it's a relaxing, beautiful experience which helps team-building, teamwork, leadership and orientation quite a bit. The new features (stances) are amazing. Holding control and pressing w,a,s or d acts responsively and puts you into a certain stance.  The controls are easy to learn, flying isn't all that difficult if you have some patience and the nimble-ness to use auto-hover. Armoured vehicles (for now) contain only Armoured Personnel Carriers, but there'll be Main Battle Tanks soon, which is AMAZING. The names are altered, but you might recognize how the Zamak trucks are actually Kamaz trucks! (THE MORE YOU KNOW!)  Anyhow, the aircraft (helicopters for now!) are amazing and perform quite well. My favourite? I don't have one for now! But onto the weapons, which I find sauce.  Weapons are highly customizeable and allow for dynamic attachments and replacing the aforementioned. Stealth operation? Slam a suppressor on. Long-range? No problem, here's a scope. And it all goes together very well, but the content is still lacking. However, it's a beta and I can't wait for the actual release of the game (which will be amazing, as the beta is saucetastic as it is).  To anyone who wants to explore a mediterranean-esque island, I truly suggest purchasing this game and going crazy. As I said, you have a lot of options, the editor itself, you can craft campaigns in that thing. As stupid as it seems, it can be something better than singleplayer/multiplayer combined.   It's all down to you and how you wish to play it out. You could even try roleplay servers and be a civilian. But that's not what this is about. This is warfare.  10/10
1506	1	a	Nice slideshow. Better than anything i could make on powerpoint. A*
4434	1	a	ArmA III is great. Arma II aside, thereâs nothing else like it. As time goes on will only get better â but, at launch, it feels a little like moving sideways rather than forwards.
893	1	a	Deffinatly recomend this game, ive spent over 800hrs on this and have loved every bit of it!!!!!!!!!!
2695	1	a	Arma... that is a soldier and one life, lots of helicopters, tanks and other things
905	1	a	Little bit of everything in this game. With hundreds of mission files to choose from, each server has its own unique features. Worth a buy.
3682	1	a	With this game and it's great (modding) community only the sky is the limit. This is truly a 'Be all you want to be' game.
2206	1	a	so much to do so much fun until you have to run alot then it sucks lol jk actually not jk i dont like running
3141	1	a	BEST GAME EVER..... HELICOPTERS CAR ATV A VAST RANGE OF WEAPONRY
4879	0	a	this game is slowly dying along with its servers very hard to get into, and just not worth the price  refunded
751	1	a	This game is badass
1777	1	a	Ths game is alot of fun, BEST game I played so far! I was able to try it free this past weekend and wanted to buy it but the Price went up before I could and it just dd not fit into my budget.   ((((((((((( But I have to give this one 5 Stars! )))))))))))  If you are going to buy a game on STEAM, Make it ARMA 3 !!!
2014	1	a	love this game totaly worth every penny
267	1	a	Excellent military sim engine with a huge pool of mods to create just about any mission or situation you can imagine.
3277	1	a	Singleplayer: The campaign is dull but at the same time, barely cool. (you probably wont touch it)  Multiplayer: Although this game takes quite a tuffy 'pooter to run well on most multiplayer servers than most people have available to them, and the â¥â¥â¥â¥ processor usage due to the gaming engine it runs on, I've never found a better game than ArmA 3. I've looked into this game for about a year or two before I even got into PC gaming and it became one of my first footsteps into the PC gaming world (aside from WoW when I was like 13, but lets be serious here.) The replayability you'll find in this game holds no bounds. You have a vibrant cultural community and more content then you'll know what to do with...DID I MENTION CONTENT? You've got gamemodes upon gamemodes upon workshop toys to play on and with, from Wasteland, Altis Life, King of the Hill, Exile, and so so much more. Although the controls WILL take a bit to get used to, you wont ever forget. Think this is a military combat simulator? Well it is, but it's also practically a flying simulator, a helicoptor simulator, a life simulator, a zombie survival simulator, and even a verbal harassment simulator. But let's get down to it kiddos.  ----Pros -This game can be about 40+ other games that you've always wanted and be better. -Precise movements to benefit you in combat (Micro-Stances) -Ballistic physics that work -Beautiful large game -Tons of gamemodes that aren't always 'military' -Hilarious physics that break in the best of ways (there are two terms, 'ArmA Logic' and 'ArmA Physics') -The most replayability you'll ever have out of any game TO DATE.  ----Cons -DLC bundle(25USD) is annoying if you don't have it, as many servers use the DLC content and you'll be bothered with a popup quite a bit. -Medium to High Performance computer to run it -Physics in the game engine aren't always the greatest of things and WILL screw you over at times (but almost rarely) -MASSSIIIIIVEEEEEE LEARNNNINGGGG CURRRRVVVEEEEEE -Did I mention the learning curve for the controls? -Learning curve -Although the game can be used as a simulator for many things, it's FAR from a driving simulator. -Rocks and branchy bushes (You'll know) -The game engine is quite â¥â¥â¥â¥ but no where near unplayable  VERDICT------- ArmA 3 in my opinion is the best game on the market to date with the experience you'll get out of it. Proof? I have 1600+ hours on it, and my 2nd place game in my library only has about 400. Some of my best gaming moments in my life came from this game 10/10 would buy again     ..but seriously did I mention the learning curve?
994	1	a	This game is very enjoyable, my personal favorite game mode is Wasteland because it takes the least ammount of time to get into the action. The game has amazing graphics and the game play is extremely enjoyable. I personally haven't came across a bug yet since I've played. There is many game modes and such and I feel like this is basically another Garry's Mod for the simple fact that you can play it for countless hours and never get bored.
2386	1	a	so good game i love this game :)
1576	1	a	Game has good fps value, but physics like jumping off a 5 foot building could kill you. You also can die from glitching through walls and the ground and happens often and the multiplayer have some hackers and kids and physics are very not balenced like helicopters sliding down a small slope and tipping over quickly. Don't forget to watch out driving too because if you so mistakenly hit a 'wire fence' the whole car gets ruined. Lastly there needs to be a option to fix the mic INGAME!
3329	1	a	THIS GAME IS GOOD I PLAY IT ALL DAY 
3357	1	a	Really Like this Game its Really like a Sandbox Simulation and you can mod it how you want. I still play it after 400h and I'm still motivated. Really good game.
1178	1	a	Arma 3 is, by far, the best millitary simulator I've ever seen. Only for those who like hardcore millitary simulators.
4022	1	a	Almost a perfect infantry combat experience. The peripheries aren't quite polished, especially air combat, and there is a lack of content in the base game, but the ability to make mods for this game is what really makes it shine. Overall I give this game a 9/10
3094	1	a	yeah its good in everything it does. kinda a bummer that dlc is so expensive when its a mil sim and u would expect what is in the dlcs to be in the game standard unlike arma 2 had dlcs that were new games by them selves
2184	1	a	If you liked getting 30 frames in Arma 2, you'll LOVE getting 20 frames in Arma 3!
53	1	a	Would recommend this game and the entire series to anyone! Great stuff, from the first game to the last.
4912	1	a	I don't know how to write a game review, so I'm going to show my favorite Fish Pie recipe  Ingredients  400g skinless white fish fillet 400g skinless smoked haddock fillet 600ml full-fat milk 1 small onion , quartered 4 cloves 2 bay leaf 4 egg small bunch parsley , leaves only, chopped 100g butter 50g plain flour pinch freshly grated nutmeg 1kg floury potato , peeled and cut into even-sized chunks 50g cheddar , grated   Method  Poach the fish. Put the fish in the frying pan and pour over 500ml of the milk. Stud each onion quarter with a clove, then add to the milk, with the bay leaves. Bring the milk just to the boil â you will see a few small bubbles. Reduce the heat and simmer for 8 mins. Lift the fish onto a plate and strain the milk into a jug to cool. Flake the fish into large pieces in the baking dish. Hard-boil the eggs. Bring a small pan of water to a gentle boil, then carefully lower the eggs in with a slotted spoon. Bring the water back to a gentle boil, with just a couple of bubbles rising to the surface. Set the timer for 8 mins, cook, then drain and cool in a bowl of cold water. Peel, slice into quarters and arrange on top of the fish, then scatter over the chopped parsley. Make the sauce. Melt half the butter in a pan, stir in the flour and cook for 1 min over moderate heat. Take off the heat, pour in a little of the cold poaching milk, then stir until blended. Continue to add the milk gradually, mixing well until you have a smooth sauce. Return to the heat, bringto the boil and cook for 5 mins, stirring continually, until it coats the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat, season with salt, pepper and nutmeg, then pour over the fish. Assemble and bake. Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Boil the potatoes for 20 mins. Drain, season and mash with the remaining butter and milk. Use to top the pie, starting at the edge of the dish and working your way in â push the mash right to the edges to seal. Fluff the top with a fork, sprinkle with cheese, then bake for 30 mins. Make up to a day ahead, chill, then bake for 40 mins.
1797	1	a	there are words that have not been created that describe this game!
752	1	a	Inconsistent performance, but you soon forget about that when you realise the scale of battles and just how in-depth a game it is. Amazing.
5104	1	a	what? how can I write a review? I don't even have this game... -_-
4054	1	a	Tis a great game...
2319	1	a	good job bohemia. this game is worth the money
3435	1	a	Well for start off i love Arma 3 its an amazing military simulator and its really fun to play with friends on servers like; life , wasteland , breaking point and more mission files to enjoy! But im really dissapointed at the same time. Arma cut MAJOR corners in development and is very glitchy.You fall through stairs , get stuck in rocks and sometimes d-sync which isnt fun at all cause you loose all your stuff if you die or if your hurt, loose the advantage in a gun fight.I wish Arma brought out a patch which fixes all of these bugs but in all , this is a really good game and you should buy it if you like first person shooters.
4332	1	a	Hard to run, fun to play.
3359	1	a	well.... if you like being shot on a server my your own team for getting into the the wrong heli then this game is for you but it is very good to play with friends
5081	1	a	ENG:  The most realistic war simulation game on Steam, which just keeps getting better. Referral!  FIN:  Realistisin sotasimulaatio peli steamissa, joka vain paranee. Suositteluni!
5337	1	a	This game was released as an incomplete game, but content is added on a regular basis. In a couple of years it'll actually be worth the $30 price tags it'll be by then. I don't recommend it at its current price, but overall it's a very solid military simulation game.
2912	1	a	Quick question. Are you a simulator guy, but also a big fan of FP Shooters?  If you answered yes, this is a game for you.   It looks amazing, just look at it, LOOK at it. I don't have the new Apex DLC, but the more i see of it the more i think its worth the full price, but i will wait for sale, cuz i ain't got that much money.   Multiplayer experiance is just insane, you can do anything you wish to do, and there are some Roleplay servers that are equally as fun. Communication sometimes gives me and other people problem, but for the most part it works great.  If you are just a FPS fan, it's not a game for you. This is mostly the game where you will run 2km only to get instashot in the head. It's that reason your every step has to be responsable and overthought. You don't wanna go rushing in.   The only part i don't like it's how its set in this 'future' and there are some weapons there that just look too familliar but are not what you expected. I don't see much point on not just all bringing a machinegun with some scope on it to battle. All weapons pretty much shoot the same but some have more bullets.  I like the pistols though, people usually laugh when they see a little pistol, especially in a roleplay server, but they stopped laughing when i put a bullet in their head with it.  Overall this game is a solid 9/10. Buy it.
4423	1	a	This right here, this is not a game. This, Arma 3, is an EXPERIENCE!
1407	1	a	if you are looking for a harcore tactical pc gmae. Look no further arma 3 is the shizzle
1915	1	a	Dont have the game yet, but It's giving me a chance to give it a review anyways so â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ it.   10/10
517	1	a	People complain about the price, the first CoD on Steam is still $20. People complain about the lag, but I don't have this problem and I do not have a gaming PC. Just look a bit deeper, edit your settings better, and fix your launch parameters. People complain about the DLC, that's countless man hours put into making them for you, especially the marksman DLC with the new models, animations, vests, all the ambient objects. And the helicopter DLC, with all the new objects for making even more detailed bases, the new flight model, the ropes with actual physics. None of this stuff HAD to be made for your enjoyment, they could have released skins and announcer packs or remade their maps to sell as DLC *cough* Treyarch and DICE *cough*. (god forbid they put a pricetag on their time, with all the free updates they make such as Zeus and Eden too) They have a modding community with their old maps, missions, new maps, editors, new models, skins, weapons, animations, scripts, vehicles, effects and more and those are in the thousands. So, before listening to the complaints that everyone thinks is actually a valid complaint, listen to all the things that are fixing it, and making them better.
1158	1	a	Arma 3 is probably the most fun I've had in a long time. Singleplayer is ok but scenarios from the workshop are really fun. Most of my time is spent playing the Wasteland mod. I recommend you all try it out cause it can get insanely fun with a group of friends all teamed up in one server.
135	1	a	Well , i bought this game on the first Alpha Days , when it was 32.99$.  I Really like Strategy (hope i wrote it right) and Simulator games &amp; FPS games.  This game Contains many objects and many ways to play , the vanilla has no many weapons nor cars and aircrafts ,  BUT , there is A BIG BUT , you can use the Workshop on steam to use Maps \ Missions \ other mods to make your playing much more funny and realistic.  if you consider spend around 40 - 50$ when it's on sale , do that , on this game of course.
587	0	a	Waste of money.  I have a 280x and FX-8350 And I get 20 fps in every server but 60fps in single player.  Unplayable garbage, please optimize the ancient engine so I can at least get a pleayable framerate on servers. Stop using 2 of my 8 cores.
4213	0	a	this games is really messed up and honesly if you are new to the game you have no idea what your are doing. once you find out the game becomes boring and long.  this game is onloy alive because of mods which also are a pain to install..  dont waste your time.  steam support &lt; request refund&lt; thx gaben got my money back for this crap
3538	1	a	ArmA 3. A 'tacticool' shooter. Sorry, that was terrible.  ArmA 3 is an apparent military simulator. I'd personally call it a casual simulator, considering the bugs (the engine is riddled with them, but the devs are active on fixing bugs and creating new ones in the process). There are issues such as: - The movement system (transitions can be jarring- a sprint can becoming a walk just because the terrain is *slightly* steeper, which has got me killed more than a few times in the past, though it can be solved by running in weird ways up hills) - Over zealous stamina system (60lb of equipment will drain your stamina whilst jogging in a few minutes, 10lb will do so in a few seconds later) and issues like that. The guys I play with tend to disable it, and for good reason. - 'Futuristic' theme through the use of various real world vehicles and weapons - no AKs, M4/16s and countless other classic weapons we all know and love. Sucks, in my opinion. - Really dumb ai. Some improvements over the ArmA 2 ai - ai reacts faster and better, but can react a little... Overzealous. A single soldier in a good position can lock up squads by taking random shots, preventing them from being ordered around (units love to crawl when under fire), requiring a lot of micromanaging as a squad leader - if you're playing as Zeus or using High Command for squads, good luck.  There are many others, but I can't think of them at the moment. But, now for some good news.  You can install mods, fixing a large number of gameplay related issues. Sadly the first issue with the movement system can't be fixed (or hasn't, at least), but the stamina system has been fixed by a number of mods to be somewhat more realistic and more managable.  Mods such as RHS: Escalation (the US forces and Russian Armed Forces parts) plus the HLC packs solve the lack of modern weapons - the two mods / packs are my faviourites for this sort of thing.  Various realism mods around such as AGM and CSE also help improve the realism of the game.  DLC is also free with the game, sort of. Similar to what they did in ArmA 2, you get the content but with some restrictions - so you can play with people who have it, though you may not be able do access all the features, and there may be some annoying notifications. ;p
4000	1	a	Very fun game. But downfall of it is that you need some of your friends to play in order to have lots of fun. + the AI cheat
