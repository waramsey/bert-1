2576	1	a	Deadly premonition tries to mix elements of an open world action game with a survival horror game and it achieves this goal to an extent. It is a poor pc port (although this is somehow mitigated by DPfix) and the production values are subpar but for those who are willing to dig deeper there is a valuable treasure to be found. The direction of the script is exceptional, the characters are well fleshed out and memorable (at least, most of them) and the overall mood is a perfect blend of comedy relief moments and serious thriller sequences. Also, the soundtrack is among the finest I've heard in any game the last 6-7 years. So, give it a try and see for yourself if you can appreciate a one-of-a- kind flawed gem

2409	1	a	At the moment (2.5 hours played) I have not any problems with performance. The argument is interesting and the game is enjoyable. It has problems with the controls and the aim, I think they could be better. I recommend this game if you like free world games (like far cry). In my case I bought it for 20 euros and I think is a good prize, but I dont recommend pay more for this game. Note: 7/10
2672	1	a	This game is quirky, unpolished and unfortunately very crash prone - but nonetheless a hidden gem in my opinion. Story, characters and atmosphere are simply great. It is an open world mystery thriller with a strong resemblance to the TV series Twin Peaks by David Lynch, which is quite unique as far as I know. Apart from the main storyline there are numerous side missions. Most of them are somewhat hidden, but they provide additional understanding of the world (a North-American small town) and the people within it. After many entertaining hours it was hard for me to say goodbye to Greenvale in the end.
1437	1	a	This game is awesome, a lot really! It's just... ZOMBIES! What else can I say tough... It keeps you in constant seek of achievements, 100 achievements to unlock and do all possible to get them. It's a bit annoying some of them and also throughout the story, but far from that, it entertains you for a lot of time. I recommend it to those that are patient and wants to complete everything! Good luck unlocking all achievements!

1070	0	a	At first impression I thought this was going to be a demonic Hitman game but as I've further played this game I noticed this is more of a point-and-click adventure game. Concept is basically collect your items, find your target to eliminate and basically watch the person die. It doesn't really have freedom like the Hitman games unfortunately it's very linear. Quite honestly, the game is a little boring. You're just Lucifer's wild child and you go on a murduring rampage. Nothing too deep about it but it's built upon a generic horror flick. I guess the only thing that makes it worthwhile to see is seeing some pretty gorey cutscenes but other than that it's not worth the full price. I would suggest getting it on sale.

2989	1	a	Even though some foibles and abject crashes occur throughout each playthrough, I still highly regard this as an all time personal favorite of mine. It is hard to pinpoint exactly what it is that makes me adore this game so much. Maybe it is the idiosyncratic nature of each character, it might be the alluring soundtrack accompanying the game or it could also be due to all the different anecdotes spread out in the quirky town of Greenvale. It's far from being a perfect game but what it delivers is a memorable taste in your mouth.
398	1	a	Well this game is one of those buggy/gitchly games but in all it was quite fun you know if being a demon child doing all types of puzzles is your thing
1636	1	a	  Ok I beat the game as far as after meeting the mayor face to face. After that the game â¥â¥â¥â¥ed all kinds of up. I was stuck with the cam feed as my hud so then I reloaded last save then I got stuck in a safe house and could not jump to get out of the window. This is by far one of the worst game ever. FPS was so â¥â¥â¥â¥ed I never got over 17 FPS and my PC is over the min requirements. Really WTF! You I only played it for free this weekend but you guys should give me $60 for this â¥â¥â¥â¥.

The only downside I can see is poor optimization and for some people driving ceratin vehicles. Also, now it is on sale and will most likely be on the Steam Holiday Sale so it is fairly cheap.

I didn't buy it because of the reviews but got it on sale just for poops and giggles.... I hate single player games.... I didn't really like fall out 4... but this game, the universe, it really draws you in. I recommend it on sale, or with the money you got back from.no mans sky
1500	1	a	It's not the most interesting game, but I have to admit that I actually had fun with it during the free weekend they did. And once we got used to the coop, the boyfriend and I had quite a lot of fun in that actually. The weapon customization is actually pretty damn nice and the standout element of the gameplay. Swapping out different receivers for each weapon to make them do something different is actually really good. While technically only carrying three weapons, the pistol and two primary weapons, the alternate receivers are always available meaning you effectively have nine weapons at all times if you have all the receivers for each weapon. It's something I'd really love to see in a lot of other games. The open world is what you'd expect from the recent Far Cry titles, or any open world game from Ubisoft really. Clear out rather meaningless outpost/checkpoint style zones until you've filled up a meter. At least there is an actual change in the world, albeit minor, when you fill up that meter. People start appearing on the streets of the 'yellow zones' protesting and fighting with the KPA, things are lit on fire, it at least feels like there is some response to your actions. Gunplay is fairly solid, some guns feel a little weightless and meager, but some really feel good to fire. Coop is the highlight of the whole game though. While set up just as preset missions set in the singleplayer maps, usually with restrictions on where you can go without completing certain objectives, it feels fun playing alongside others. As opposed to the singleplayer, you also have character customization in the form of picking various skills and wearable equipment to give you different passive perks and different cosmetics. I feel like the only downside is that I really wanted even more to do in the coop because it was genuinely that fun. For $15 it's definitely worth it, even for $20 though I'd say it's certainly worth it if you aren't opposed to the more typical Ubisoft style open world in the singleplayer.
2975	1	a	âââââ Wonderfully great game, once you get past the graphics and driving you will find yourself enjoying a totally different type of game than what is available out there, I didn't go into the game thinking i'd like it much , but damn i was proven wrong, as the game progresses it just gets better, so if your a fan of thriller/action/sandbox/murder-investigation you'll love this game, if not you could very possibly still be pleasantly surprised by this games story and gameplay style, so give it a try!

464	1	a	Play as six year old Lucius the Antichrist and murder people horrific ways. Seriousely though this game is completely evil. Riding around your house on a tricycle on your way to kill somebody is freaky.   Lucius is a pretty decent game if you like creepy games. The controls feel incredibly smooth and the graphics look nice. My only complaint was that the ending felt unfinished, like they just ran out of money (being an indie game this is probable) and/or forgot to add the last five minutes.
2773	1	a	Now before I say that this game is fantastic here's a fair warning and a bit of advice. This game is filled with a ton of issues similar to Dark Souls, it may not have GFWL but instead you must run it on Windows 98 if you don't want it crashing on you all the time. There is a Dark Souls patch as well from the same guy for this game. Now even with all of its issues this is the definitive version to play due to the poor framerates the PS3 version of Director's Cut receives.  Imagine that old David Lynch classic Twin Peaks was made in to a game, sure there's Alan Wake with all of its homages but what if it was a full blown video game. This is exactly what that game would be, it may be from a Japanese perspective but it's all there. The mysteries, the drama, the characters, the large open world in a small countryside town. What it lacks in graphics and gameplay it makes up for with charm. All the characters have their quirks and the world feels alive. You can spend plenty of time in the world without participating in the crime. This is a game made for fans of Twin Peaks. It's still possible to enjoy without watching the show but you might not be able to fully appreciate this beauty and it may be very difficult to get in to. I would recommend this to any fan who just want to relax in this fantastic simulator.

2545	1	a	The game where everyone forgets to introduce themselves... lol  Many people already sayd that this game is not good, but it's also good. Bad graphics, stiff and a little broken. Also annoying that maps has not a faint idea of waypoints.  BUT, thereÂ´s something really good in this game that I can't quite put the finger on. Something in the dirty air reminds me of The Whitcher (best rpg), and the inquisition context plus the ramifications offered by the chose class has some appeal too. Mechanics are accetable, fun to loot and sensible powers... makes me imagine what it could be with more artworking. Hope this isn't dead.

1451	1	a	This game took a lot of heat after it launched, with almost everyone saying it was terrible. I cant comment on this as i dint play it back then, But i can say that in its current state, i like the game quite a bit. The few bugs that remain are minor, and dont affect the gameplay significantly.  A few ppl still complain that its too hard, and that you can get swarmed by enemies, But in my opinion what those people dont understand is that this is one of those few FPSs where you are NOT invincible. You actually have to know when to fight AND when to run (like when reinforcements arrive), or you WILL die. I find this game mechanic very realistic, you are fighting in occupied cities, crawling with enemy soldiers. It makes sense that once you start trouble you HAVE to do your thing fast and go away before you get swarmed.  The weapons are great imo, they actually have recoil, you CANNOT carry 10 rifles, 1 rpg, 50 grenades and a flame thrower. You actually have a carrying capacity, and you also have a reasonable capacity on how much ammo you can carry. There is also a system where you customize and even transform your guns at any time, e.g. buy the proper 'kits' and turn your pistol into an SMG, add a silencer, or a laser sight, etc. Any time you want! no need to go to a 'weapons bench' or anything.  Some also say that the game is 'too generic', that it doesnt do anything diferent. I couldnt disagree more. In my eyes, -&gt;Realism&lt;- sets this game apart. You are NOT invincible, you CANNOT defeat 150 enemy soldiers at the same time, you CANNOT carry an entire warehouse of guns &amp; ammo, and you CANNOT endure 5 RPG hits to the head. Here you cant just go running arround shooting everything. You have to plan your attacks, or die. Overall i find the game realistic, and very fun to play.  Graphics are very nice, and currently the game runs fine on my less than stellar PC (i5, nvidia GTX 750ti). No performance issues for me. Controls are responsive and easy to learn &amp; use.  Bottom line:  If your idea of an FPS is 'i am God, no one can touch me, and i will just run and kill everything i see', then you will probably NOT like this one.  If you prefeer the gameplay to be more tense, where you need to plan stuff and act fast to avoid being chopped to pieces, conserve ammo, plan on what weapons are right for the current job, and know when you need to retreat instead of fight, then you will like this one!

I can see the gameplay mechanics possibly getting a bit samey throughout the campaign, but at present Im thoroughly enjoying this - A+++++++++  Update 31/12/16 - well im 22 hours in now and am pretty far through the single player - have got loads of side missions untouched, so plenty of playability yet. Am still thoroughly enjoying this game - still cant believe the hate this has been getting - gunplay is wonderful as far as im concerned - story line - yeah its ok, but its the firefights that win me over every time - A++++++++++ - its also on the Steam sale at the mo for Â£8.99 - unbelieveable value if you ask me - go get it !!!!!!!!

2795	1	a	Definitely one of the most unique games: Deadly is a game that despite its many flaws, is worth playing. As many other people have said, it's so bad, it's good. The plot is bizarre, with odd twists and turns, though it does borrow heavily from Twin Peaks. However, it actually comes together quite nicely in the end and is certainly one of the most memorable I've seen in years. The gameplay reminds me of Majora's Mask, with the variety of side-quests that depend on the time of day.  Admittedly the gameplay can be cumbersome, and some of the side-quests are way more frustrating than they should be because of it. Also, there are a number of technical difficulties (I've died a few times by falling through the floor). However, if you can get past those annoyances, it's a game that is worth your time.
2202	0	a	Save your money the story is horrible and no one plays online. I bought this for the story and was disappointed. The enemies can find you through the walls and its impossible to be stealthy. It pushes you to be call of duty. I only recommend it for those types of non strategy shoot them up types of players.

However its story and characters have their unexpected quirks which may put you off, while late-game can get tedious with lengthy backtracking.  This game has left me with very mixed feelings, but my overall enjoyment still outweighs the frustrations and disappointments. For the measely $5 there's plenty of quality content even if you ignore the main story.    THE GOOD:

2283	1	a	In my honest opinion the game played out very well even with a few of the ai pathing problems although I do feel there could have been much more done with the game due to the lack in purchasable gear i.e. backpack upgrades and such I think some more armor choices would have been good. Although the game plays out very well I believe there were a lot of problems story wise and the killing of characters that could have been a key player in future instalments of the story, but that being said all in all it was a very fun game and I would easily wish to play future versions if they are like this.  ps. the faces look abit outdated lol

1248	1	a	Zombie Driver is a damn good game, but if you read my recommendation for the original version, you knew that already. This HD version adds some choice features like rechargable turbo, boss fights, an extended story mode, and a guest appearance by the van from L4D's Crash Course campaign. It's a classic top-down driving game in the vein of Death Rally or the original Grand Theft Auto, with plenty of fast action, violence and fun to spare. It's a simple pleasure with no multiplayer, but it's got a triple combo of story missions, races and survival modes. If you didn't play the original game, then this is the version to get. So strap in and gun that engine, those zombies aren't going to splat themselves.
271	1	a	This game gave me nightmares and herpes for 40 hours.
2569	1	a	This game gets both a 0/10 and a 10/10.  I've thought about this game for months-- Not because of its plot, its gameplay, or its presentation. No. I've wondered if SWERY had planned for the plot to make no sense with terrible dialogue, if he had planned the gameplay to be stiff and hilariously broken. If he planned for this 'serious survival-horror game' to turn around and moon us all along.  It's either a trainwreck or a complete miracle that this game exists.  It could be both for all I know.  Please buy this game. You're witnessing the birth of the first B-Game.  The squirrels make monkey noises. THE SQUIRRELS MAKE MONKEY NOISES.

2072	1	a	I just want to start by saying; if there ever is another game, i wouldn't hesitate to buy it..   Well... Here we go..  As a major fanboy of the original Homefront game, I was hoping to see a more polished/ extended version of it. In actuality, this game seems completely different (i'm not even sure if it's fair to compare the two).   While I was certainly suprised by what by what was delivered, the story seems fun enough, I am a little disheartened by the multiplayer. Which was something the original game did better than Battlefield 3 (before it became an 'unoriginal reboot every last detail except for the color of their eyes' style game). I understand that ther was quite a bit of trading hands over the lifetime of this game's developement, and im happy that it didn't turn out to be an utter mess. The story was greatly elongated and completely unique compared to the successor, which i consider a plus.  In the end, there are no other games quite like it, and i cant stress how refreshing the story was compared to the 'find enemy, shoot enemt, win' monotony of most games these days. Ithink that most AAA titles could learn a thing or two from this.

651	0	a	This game is not God awful, but it's not very good, either. I would only recommend it if it were on sale.  Lucius spends most of his time murdering innocent people in his (easy to get lost in) mansion. Each chapter is a new person to kill. Gameplay is completely linear. You cannot decide to kill the maid right now and kill the mechanic next and then your mother. You also don't get any freedom in deciding how anybody dies. The game does at least have some creative (somewhat unrealistic) deaths, though, it's sorta cool to see somebody's face get sawn open.  Each chapter requires you to kill each individual in a *very* specific way. You can usually get a good idea what the game wants you to do (poison, nail guns, revolvers...) but you may have trouble figuring out exactly how the game wants you to accomplish your task and you will likely need to refer to a guide to figure the exact actions the game wants you to take. It's annoying that it's not more clear.  Another con to this game is the fact that you cannot save in the middle of a chapter, which compounds the previous issue I have with this game. You are undoubtedly having trouble figuring out the exact steps the game wants you to take, so every time you mess up and get a game over (which can be pretty easy to get) you get to start the *entire* level over, re-picking up items and getting back to the point where you can try to experiment and see what needs to be done, just to get another game over and do it all over again. It's very tiresome.  The powers could have been done a bit better. The mind control power is rather obscure, you can't just mind control someone to take your gun and go shoot somebody else, (That would be fun!) all you can really do with it is pick a person and pick an object to interact with it. You'll need to place items from your inventory somewhere in the environment first, that that threw me off the first couple of times. The telekinesis also controls really really badly. One kill in particular in the bathroom is super super hard to pull off. Luckily it lets you try multiple times very easily but considering how badly the telekinesis controls I wish it would just have activated the kill once you got close enough; you've figured out the exact actions the game wants you to take, and that's all this game really is.  You also have to avoid getting caught and stealth doesn't work the way you might think. This isn't like Thief where sitting in the shadows means you are unseen, being stealthy just means, once again, taking a path or doing some extra action that the game very specifically wants you to do in order to be unseen, though the memory wipe power is very useful for this.  There's not a whole lot of thinking you get to do yourself in order to continue murder people without getting caught. It's a shame; before I got this game I was thinking you had to constantly think one step ahead of the detective to keep getting away with murder but the game will always hold your hand and say 'You'll have to not be seen here,' 'Hide evidence here,' and 'It doesn't matter if this person sees you anymore, because you're about to kill him.'  The graphics are alright, they can be a little â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ sometimes. The game has some minor little glitches in it as well but nothing to ruin your experience or figure out how to work around. The story is pretty dull and the characters are not very engaging (though you are going to kill them all anyway.) I do really like the music.  The clunky and disappointing end bosses are a perfect representation of this entire game. If you like the concept and want to see what having some devil powers are like, get this game on sale. You can have a bit of fun with it, but it's definitely not worth $19.99.

1551	0	a	  Seems like it could be fun but shooting mechanics and combat are so simple, uninspired, boring and depressing that I had to uninstall it.
1178	1	a	I wish that I could show you the screenshots I took while playing this game. Lucius came at the right time for me after playing a game that had no killing whatsoever, and I am so happy to say that it overdelivered in terms of the violence I was looking for. Despite the graphics being undercooked for a game that's only a couple of years old, the voice acting being a little under par, and almost every puzzle in the game consisting of only four steps, what Lucius lacks in polish it certainly more than makes up for in graphic, satisfying, violence. Having picked this one and it's sequel up for less than a cup of coffee in a recent sale, I probably wouldn't have even played the first instalment except that I saw it had been released in the last couple of years. â¥â¥â¥â¥ I'm glad I did though, because it would have been a huge mistake to miss out on this little gem! Reminiscent of early PS2 games like Hitman, just shorter, and with more gore and less guns... but Satan... and a tricycle... so yay.

1029	1	a	TL;DR = I got to squash someones head under a grand piano, 10/10 would play again whilst playing again.  Not a bad game really, played and completed this when it first came out and I remember thinking at the time it wasn't worth the full asking price but as I have now picked it on steam for 90% off it is an absolute steal.  the subject matter is fairly original as I can't remember any other games that let you play as the son of the Devil a la Omen style (please feel free to comment if there are others like this so I can play them).  Graphically it's not too bad at all and sound wise there is some good effects when you are roaming around setting up your little 'accidents'. Options wise, other than the ability to rebind keys and set resolution there aren't many PC options but in all honesty it doesn't really make a difference. I have played this both with a K/M and a 360 Joypad and there is no real difference both are good methods of control for this game.   Buy this on sale play it get the trading cards (there are cards even though they aren't listed on the store page) and unleash your inner Devil.

1639	1	a	It is a good game for the first 4 hours but after that it gets repetitive.There is a lot of variety in weapon customization which actually doesn't apply in combat as you almost always do the same tactics and takeouts.Other than that the graphics are quite a joy to look at but not at the levels of crysis 3 as it uses the same engine.Homefront The revolution is an open world fps at the style of far cry 3 where you go around liberating posts and doing the main mission or side quests.

I paid for the product I cant use. Guess Ill pirate a copy since I legally own the game.   This game would have been great to play on my older computer, but of course yet again another reason why DRM needs to go away on steam. Steam is the DRM not your â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ty website solutions. Let this be a lesson to all gaming companies to leave the silly cun.t shi.t to the professionals. No one wants your DRM.
1023	0	a	Lucius feels more like a point and click game with a third person interface than it does a stealth/horror game. The world is too big. There isn't much room for creativity. It seems you need to find the one item that will allow whatever the next death sequence is to take place. The voice acting is stilted. The writing is pretty generic. All in all, life is short and there are stronger games out there to play.
2540	0	a	If you can endure the terrible ui (oh my eyes), if you can accept tons of bugs, if you can quit then enter the game again and again just becasue the memory leak, if you just want to read a detective novel, you can chooes this game.
2823	1	a	The production values are last gen, the dialouge is goofy and awkward, the voice acting flip flops between lazy and hammy as hell, and yet...well, somewhere around the second hour this game transformed from a seemingly 'me too!' survival horror game to one of the most engrossing open world titles I've ever played. It's been a said a million times, but there seriously isn't anything else like it this gen, and it's more than worth plowing through, if for it's lead character (who is one of the most bizarre and awkward video game protagonists I've ever seen) and it's, despite all odds, more often than not intriguing murder mystery.

937	1	a	When I bought this game I thought it'd be a quick little indy game that only lasted an hour or so. In reality it's pretty long for the price, and really fun. I got this and part two for 6 bucks in a steam sale, though i'd have been happy had i paid 20. Nice graphics if you care about that sort of thing, and well put together. So far I haven't had any problems with glitches and such either. I like this game a lot and it's pretty creative when it comes to how you kill your targets. It's dark, sinister, and you really feel like a creepy little devil child. It almost feels similar to a less complex hitman game, though instead of an assassin you're a devil child with a few satanic powers.

When stuck in tasks, you have to think. That's also great thing, cuz u are helping ur brain. In this game, you also learn a lot of things.  The voice acting is not that good, so i think it's about 8/10. Voice acting and lipsync often failes. With fun, this is also one 'MORBID' game.  Most of the time, you have no idea what to do 'cuz there is no hints where to go. Huuuge house sometimes becomes boring, when u have to wander around it over and over. Can't kill how u wants.

This game, it's like torture and I should mention that I bought it when it was 40% off, it's some sort of purgatory, the more you play the more you descend into madness. T-the graphics, the story, the controls the blatant copying of Far Cry 3,4 and Primal, the voice 'ACTING', the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing voice acting!!!!

I enjoyed playing the priest class, the focus on spells felt great in my opinion. The user inteface could have been better.   Story  The game has a lot of text, so you'll have to read.

1572	0	a	The game isn't bad but it's flawed and rushed. â¢ Animation issue/clipping/slowdown â¢ FOV max of 65 â¢ Dumb as a rock AI, bad pathfinding. â¢ Highly repeatitive gameplay pretty much taking what ubisoft do: Open world with 'tower'  As for the multiplayer â¢ Copied the gear system from ME coop or DA:I you gain gear from random lootbox â¢ Only 6 mission â¢ Ugly AF character creation even more limited than division with only a couple face (mostly chinese or ugly face, especially for female character)  In all. Not worth 60e (lucky for me, only play 1/6 of the price), get it on a sale or when it go under half price otherwise it's not worth it. The game is a rushed mess that should have been delayed instead of being forced out as the game feel like playing a beta with lot of flaw.  TL;DR: Do not buy for full price, get it for sale or when it's under 25-20â¬/$, it's just a subpar game in all categorie it try to get into. Even for the coop it's not worth it as it's clunky and badly put in place with expensive lootcrate with 3 item (85% of the time worthless item such as booster)
229	0	a	  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!  UPDATES: The last update for this game was OVER a year ago! Developers since then did not post an update.  PLAYERBASE: The game during its release has never reached 2 average players. I sat in the lobby for 10 minutes attempting to find a game. Alienware is still hosting a giveaway which started 23 days ago and yet the game still has not seen over an average of 4 players.  http://steamcharts.com/app/215550#All    TL;DR - Game is dead, developers left it, and the game gets redundant after 2 minutes.

The game itself is simple and pretty long if you take your time. Really kinda suprised I liked it....Try it

1604	1	a	Game is much better than I expected after reading reviews. Setting is awesome (non-combatants NPC behavior looks very natural, every house/ruin looks different and natural). Checkpoints donât similar to each other thus not became boring. Graphics is on very good level. Music is also nice. On-fly weapon mods attachment is just awesome. Scenario is quite nice (at least much better that in several recent CoD)
816	1	a	Got it on sale for $1. After playing it, I feel I would have paid up to $10; just not the normal asking price of $20. It is exactly what it says it is. A puzzle horror game putting you in the devilish shoes of a 6 year old antichrist. Pretty fun despite some flaws. Graphics aren't the best (but they work), lip sync is off sometimes during cut scenes which can take you out of the moment. Some of the acting is a little cheesy but overall good performances. One thing I wish was having more of a sandbox style for the killing. You have to kill people in very specific ways during each chapter, no choices. This is more akin to the old school point and click adventure games of the 90's (not in a bad way). I also would have liked to see a first person mode since much of your time is spend looking for items. When viewing as close as you can get in 3rd person the kids head blocks whatever the cursor is pointed at so you can't see it. All in all a fun experience. There is also a bonus game where you just try to kill priests using your fire spell, which was fun, but hard (they get into melee range and it's game over... damn crosses). Great value for the price I paid. If you enjoy old school horror movies like The Omen or Exorcist you will probably enjoy this game. Find it for $10 or less I would recommend picking it up.  If you are just looking for a slasher/shooter game go somewhere else, like I said this is a essentially a horror themed puzzle game.  Additionally they also have a sequel to this game, and it seems to have added in more open ended ways to kill people. Haven't tried it yet but thinking about checking it out.

3041	1	a	I have been a fan of Nicklas's games since I first played 'Within A Deep Forest' so many years ago. While most of his games tend to have a similar gameplay style, they are always enjoyable and have an amazing aesthetic.  Knytt Underground is one part 'Within A Deep Forest', one part 'Saira', and one part 'Knytt'. The simple platforming and exploration gameplay of Knytt is merged with the harder, physics-based platforming from WADF and is then set in a world using surreal photo-realistic environments akin to Saira.  This all produces a massive, metroid-vania-like, ambient, exploration platformer that is easy to get lost in. It is not afraid to crank up the difficulty in a few areas to keep you on your toes, but the whole map is incredibly non-linear so you are rarely forced to go through a section when you first come to it. This game is essentially one huge scavenger hunt, but it never feels like a chore, even when you are backtracking through areas you have already been to. There are quite a lot of secrets as well, many of which provide the hardest sections of the game and are completely optional.  I honestly cannot remember much from the plot apart from having to ring 4 bells, but this game left a lasting impression in the memories of simply exploring the beautiful and serene world along to the ambient, relaxing soundtrack. To me, this is the mark of a good game, and I eagerly look forward to all of Nicklas's future games.

340	1	a	Free the demon inside you and fulfill your destiny as the Devil's champion in this bloodchilling thriller game. Taking a part in a series of murders, player controls Lucius - a child... that kills.  The game's concept itself could be considered as something we have not yet seen (at least, at this large scale) in games generally. You play as a little boy who is not what he seems to be. Gameplay basically is similar to  Hitman  franchise, but it's not the same thing as you do all these bloody deeds with the child's hands (and his devil mind).  I give this game a high mark as it was a great experience and I have completed the game in a single day (evening and night, to be precise) because I couldn't have stopped once I've started.  ...Oh, one more important thing. it's not a game for kids!!! Even while main character is a kid, the game is violent and intense in some manner, so keep your kids off the screen! I'm serious!

But once you reach the ending? WOW! What a piece of crap it turns out to be! It has one of the WORST endings I have EVER witnessed for a video game! And it was done delibirately by the developer! (as there is tons of extra 'secret' stuff that could have been cut out FOR A PROPER ENDING!). And the many secrets of this game are so utterly pointless, there is really no reward for suffering trying to find/complete them.  But hey, if you are one of those people who like to play games just for the arcade aspect of them, and not for the plot, then you'll enjoy this game! I felt totally dissappointed after having spent over 30 hours to get through it!

CONS: - ...Good ideas that go poorly executed. - Mute player character - Flat characters and near meaningless interaction - Story that doesn't deliver. - 4 hours in, and i'm too bored to continue.  ---Prerequisite system info--- I'm playing on a 980ti at 2560x1440 with everything (including temporal AA) maxed and I'm averaging 85fps with adaptive gsync. It's steady and I have no real issues with the performance. Great job devs.  ----DAY 01--- I like the graphics and sound. The game has a good atmosphere, especially at night time. The guns are servicable. As others have commented, they do lack punch. Gameplay is a little repetitive, but the action is solid so its not that bad. Overall, for my first two hours I would say that the game is stable, fast and enjoyable. I just hope the gameplay opens up a little bit and expands on what you do as the player, because after taking over all the areas of the starting zone, you realize how large the map is and wonder if the gameplay will be repetitive throughout that whole experience. We'll see! Recommended.  ---DAY 02--- I've returned to the game and it's obvious there are some possible issues. First, the game is constantly streaming data. This makes sense given the open world nature, however I would go so far as to say this is borderline trashing the hard drive. The data streaming never really interferes with the gameplay, but it does result in some texture and geometry popin. Given that I'm on a fairly powerful rig and using a 6TB WD Black, the amount of IO needed to sustain the world is somewhat surprising. Suggest that you run this one from SSD or NVME if you can spare the 40 (!) TB.  As far as the game itself, I have to admit the world is starting to feel kind of flat after only 3-4 hours in. There is an abundance of good (mostly) VO work to help things along, but the mute player protagonist just seens to have nothing to say in a world so full of things to comment on. The missions and orders you receive all start to sound the same. After capturing the entirety of the first section of the map, I felt that there just wouldn't be much else to do. Its like Farcry, only less open and more modern. Maybe the most damning part of it all is that after roughly 4 hours, i'm just too bored to continue playing. There are not enough mechanics or story hooks to keep me going. It's just one mission after the next. Shame, this game has good ideas for what it wants to be, it just fails to execute them into something that is compelling to play.

1060	0	a	I want to enjoy the game but it is extremely buggy. Its been out for years yet I don't think there has been any effort to fix those bugs.  It took me around 10 minutes to place the car in the box when trying a new power. I knew what I was suppose to do, but the game refused to let it happen. As well as when the man goes to 'fix' the piano, he starts going back, I'm like uh...hello? aren't you suppose to fix it? I follow him, he goes to the bathroom and says well it must be broken my schedule says it is, lemme check again. Basically its stating I didnt break it when I did. Thats glitchy. Downright glitchy and annoying. Basically I'm just playing this game for achievements / a time saver but I'm dissapointed on how they portrayed the game and the unnecessary glitches.

449	1	a	Very fun game. sometimes challenging, sometimes gruesome, always entertaining, NEVER dull and maintains a good balance between logic and imagination.  The creators have done a great job of creating different scenarios for you to follow and figure out. Inside or out, the ambiance and graphics are very nice including the use of HDR. Dynamic weather keeps things looking pretty all year round and there are lots of nice finishing touches to keep your eyes busy. The textures are amazing.  The sound is nice and uniform throughout and along with the soundtrack adds good depth and atmosphere. Both graphics and sound come together to create a memorable environment where even just standing around is pleasant.  The plot is also good; although sometimes predictable there are always a few unexpected twists that are good for a laugh or two. One of the best things about the game-play is that you can explore at your own pace without being rushed (unless there is a specific reason).All this creates a fun, immersive and laid back approach to 3rd person adventure gaming.  There are walkthroughs online to help you out if you get really stuck, but if you use them you will get no since of satisfaction and inevitably feel like you've cheated yourself rather than won the game.  Game bugs are so few and minimal they are hardly worth mentioning. i.e. while carrying socks or underwear they might get stuck on a door (but they will release if you keep walking). The trike might (very rarely) rise a foot or two in the air if you run over an object (but will fall down again as you carry on). Once, the security guy walked right through me.  These are very minor, infrequent things that detract nothing from the game or gameplay! Especially if you have the imagination to immerse yourself into task at hand.  If you don't like something about the way this game is made (bugs or realism) i suggest you learn programming and try making your own game first Before going on a 'i'm a bug snob' crusade.  If you are religiously sensitive then this is not the right game for you. If you are religiously sensitive i can't imagine why you would even want to play.  Understanding that this is a game and not real life will go a long way to allow you to appreciate the experience that the creators are sharing. Just enjoy the ride and you'll have fun!  Review score 666 out of 10  Do your chores!

358	1	a	Haven't even finished it yet, and I'm in love. Pretty f***** up game and the story is decent. You play a six year old who murders everyone in his house because the Devil wants their souls. How much better can it get?   Ran into two bugs. A few lighting issues where it looks like the light from a flashlight is coming out of an NPC's face (happened on two separate occasions), and a bug with Will in the garage. (Spoiler Alert?) DO NOT MAKE HIM INTERACT WITH THE RAG. He will start walking in place, and then you need to start the chapter over.   It's unique and genuinely entertaining, and the gameplay and environment make you WANT to explore. Meaning you don't get really annoyed when you need to figure out what to do next.   I'd give it an honest 10/10.
2653	1	a	- Horrible port - Constant crashes - Wonky and buggy driving physics - Poor graphics - Terrible map and navigation system - The open world is almost completely empty - Some awful voice acting - Nonsensical dialogue and writing - Ridiculous characters and situations - Combat so derivative and crappy I can see them going 'Hmm, yeah, this didn't turn out so great... Let's just add a bunch of easily obtainable cheat weapons as standard otherwise no one's going to bother slogging through this.'  And despite (and a bit because) all of the above the game still manages to be utterly charming in that very peculiar Japanese way, it's a bit like Twin Peaks presented in the style of House of the Dead 2, and I sunk nearly 50 hours 100%-ing the game (including many, many restarts trying to work around bugs and problems or replaying sections due to crashes.) Common sense dictates the list above should really have precluded that, but somehow the essence of the game just made me embrace it all.  I don't quite know either.

4744	1	a	 Early Access Review
2988	1	a	When I first played this game I was blown away, not by it's graphics or it's gameplay but how strange everything was. All of the characters are memorable and 90% of the dialogue will have you saying 'what the â¥â¥â¥â¥?' but it's got tons of charm. I can't recommend this game to just anyone though because it takes effort to look past it's shortcomings and really appreciate what it offers.  Did that sum it up pretty well Zach?
1561	1	a	Solo campaign was good. (8 hours) Yellow Zones makes the shoot and run pretty fun. Attachment system is great.  Coop is horrible and short. No real point.  Great graphics. Some crashes and fps drop.  Beat it on free weekend.
3047	1	a	This is one great indie platform game, made in variety of metroidvania style, a little bit challenging at some points, for those who aim for achievements it sure is bigger chalenge. Music is very atmosferic and good, there are a lot of relaxing tunes, and some creepy, if you don't wanna spend money on this i would recommend at least listening game soundtrack. There is very little combat in this game, main focus is puzzle solving and questing, what can be big downside at first look but it isn't, this is not game's aim so that doesn't really matter. In total there are three chapters, first two as some kind of introduction and third one as the main game where whole game world can be explored, as in first two it can be done only small part of it because you control different characters at that chapters, and at third you can switch between those two whenever you want. I'm sure one day i will be back to play Knytt Underground again, make sure you do it too!

3032	1	a	Firstly, I must admit that I am a huge fan of Nifflas' (the game's developer) work. Ever since I first played Within A Deep Forest I knew I wanted to play more of his games. Getting this one on Steam was great and he's still doing great games. All the mechanics are solid and really fit well in the game. Controls are surprisingly working exactly like you'd think and the physics are something I really love. The story is rather confusing but I didn't really mind that. The characters are really well done, even though I'm sure some people will definitely disagree with me. All in all, it was a great experience and I recommend it if these kinds of games interest you.

758	0	a	fun game but not worth, becuse it last like 8 hours...  (and the game has some bugs at the end . but you can be lucky and not get any as well)  Loved the game otherwise...
2522	0	a	This game starts off really cool, the atmosphere and the whole middle-ages religious conspiracies are very intriguing (think The Name of the Rose). Alas, the plot goes downhill (basically off the cliff) fast, with extremely repetitive plotlines and quests, boring 'investigations/trials' (which are usually nothing more than fetch quests or pixel hunts then a multiple choice quiz at the end), obvious twists and the ending is just the worst.   Then there's the combat, which while when you are at the right level is ok, it is the grindiest grindfest ever. You will spend painful hours grinding just to get to be able to walk around the next area without getting one hit killed. And not to mention the horrendous stamina mechanic.  That being said, the music is amazing. Shame it's wasted on such a letdown of a game. 
1491	1	a	Well,I actually enjoyed the game.I know it has gotten some bad returns but for me...I had a blast!The story is what you would expect from an apocolyptic end of da wurld! senario but not bad as these stories go.The graphics are about the norm for this day and age and the detail is admirable.The music is cryptic in some levels and really adds to the feeling.Now the good part.....GRENADES AND THE LIMPET MINE LAUNCHER.Since there are no gibs to speak of the rag doll mechanics is hilarious.Stick a limpet mine at a soldiers feet and watch the fun.....40 feet in the air and a resounding WHTAGHHHHHHHH!The heck wit da plot and hand me a grenade.The side quests are more like mini-games than quests and the voice acting is really pretty well done also.The mocap could have been a little better but in the end it's whether you had fun ....and I DID!All in all well done....for ME!If you can get it on sale so much the better.7\10

1991	1	a	Being a person who really enjoyed the first game, I bought Homefront: The Revolution, and finished it through. It certainly is different than the first, but not necessarily in a terrible way. I don't think it is as good, but definitely does have great elements of it's own. Here is what I found:   PROS: -You are not too powerful, the KPA can take you down easily if you are not careful (when faced with a part of town completely occupied by KPA, you must sabotage KPA tech and save citizens. After you've proved that the citizens can take back whats been taken, more will join the resistance) - Graphics are amazing, this is probably one of the largest factors that really add play value  - It is very exciting when you get into conflict. The mechanics work very well when fighting, again being a large factor in play value. Plus, when any freedom fighters are near you, they'll help you. - Customization is unique and flexible - Ideas for the visuals are real atmospheric  - You can ride motorbikes! - America!    CONS: -Glitchy Textures - Spawning is pretty bad (units will pop up and disappear out of nowhere) - Voice animations very unstable - Story is not so strong (you can't really 'feel' the characters) - Weapons look bulky/oversized in the hands of the Ai - Optimization is tricky for many people's computers apparently, but if you figure out the right settings, it'll run just fine - Dramatically different from the first game(the first was awesome)  - Not worth the full price, if you are looking forward to it, buy it on sale    'Home Is Where The War Is'
1724	0	a	First off runs like crap even after the 'Fixes' someone said it pretty good that it does not matter how pretty your game looks if it does not run well at all.  Was quite boring. You will die a lot from stupid stuff and movement that seems so stiff it is hard to control. Bad story not as bad as the 1st game's story but just as dumb. Then there is the resistance.... Instead of getting things like camo body armor and anything that would be useful in an insurgency all of the resistance fighters went to Hot Topic instead.  The game is so predictable you can see every twist and turn. I honestly can't imagine what the season pass is going to do or come out with. MP is totally worthless as there seems to be no public matches unless you create one yourself and it is basically just the single player game but your not nearly as effective.  I wouldn't bother with this one.
2011	0	a	Tried it free, now understand why it has an under 40% rating. If they were looking to gain customers with a free weekend, considering thier overall rating droped 5%, i'd say that backfired lol. Probably saved allot of people money and regret though.....
4211	1	a	 Early Access Review
2396	1	a	Checked it out for a bit during the free weekend so this will be more of a first impression instead of a review.   TLDR version: Overall seems like you could have a decent time with it but I'd wait for a 60%-75% discount before buying.    There seem to be a ton of things to do but just after around 1h of messing around in the first open area I could already feel the repetition in the core gameplay loop. It's just clear building, kill plebs, activate power switch, etc. The time sensitive 'flashpoint' missions that randomly pop up do add some variety but not sure if that's enough some 10+ hours into the game.   The shooting felt fairly average. Didn't have any real issues but I also could not feel any crazy impact when mowing down enemy troops. That may have something to do with early game unmoded weaps being kinda meh tho. Seems like there is some pretty deep weapon customization so shooting may be a lot more fun later down the line.  The silent protag constantly getting talked at by every pleb he meets is fairly detrimental to the story as far as I'm concerned. Can't say much more about it since I only did the first few missions tho.   Didn't see any of the bugs people keep posting about but that may be later in the game. For me it was a completely smooth experience.   Overall I really don't know why this is rated 'mostly negative' on Steam. It's not a top of the line shooter but you can still have quite a bit of fun here. Will probably buy it after the next price drop.

377	1	a	This game filled with pure evil that I can't manage to handle. Please only try the game if you could consume it... otherwise you end up having a weird nightmare and gonna experience heavy stress-out.  Just sayin'.
2901	1	a	Pros: Amazing game filled with comedic moments, fun driving mechanics, huge plot and a great mystery covering the entire game.   Cons: Controls are kinda clunky, no gamepad support (despite being a console game before ported), and resolution is locked at 720p. Graphical options are minimal if anything, and there appear to be a few more loading texture problems than in the PS3/XBOX360 version of this game.  All in all, despite the numerous technically problems, this game is well worth buying to enjoy the characters, story, and all around funny dialogue. Playing Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut on the PS3 or XBOX360 is a better option, though. The only benefit of playing on PC is the return of Francis York Morgan's kill quotes, which were sadly missing from the console versions of Director's Cut.  9/10
1348	1	a	Rating: 7/10  A very fun, addictive game. It seems that driving over thousands of zombies and watching them splatter with full blood and gore effects never gets old! This game offers you just that. The gameplay is the core of this game, as all you get to do is kill zombies (Thousands of them), save survivors and cause mayhem. It's fairly arcade-like, so it's fun for a few minutes at a time. The graphics are not that great, but the game makes you look over it with the amount of blood and gore it throws at you on the screen. It pretty much is a top-down version of Carmageddon, so if you have played the old classic, you're gonna love this. For owners of the old Zombie Driver, this game is some what of a rip off as it doesn't offer you much in comparison - But at a nice discount it's well worth it.

268	1	a	Just finished Lucius, took me around 5 hours, and got 41 of 58 achievements.  Overall it's a pretty interesting game, you play a Lucius a 7 year old boy who lives in a mansion with his family and many maids, butlers and handymen who are under your fathers employ, except he's not your actually father, Satan is, you are the spawn of Satan who has been tasked with gather souls for your real father to acquire various powers like telekinesis, mind control and combustion. The games premise is just that, kill everyone for Satan, expect the ways you have to go about doing so are quite different and unique, the main gameplay mechanics feel like a mix between classic Hitman trial and error with it's environmental deaths. Where combining found items with environmental hazards usually result in a entertaining death cutscene and no suspicioun cast upon Lucius.  Now the story isn't great, the voice acting is hammy and weirdly paced making it sound like sentences are being stitched together from totally different actors and the animations aren't detailed either. Some of the characters are interesting enough, for example Lucius' grandfather is a hard man who has something to hide and his motives are shown throughout the game and give an interesting look on the family's rise to power and occult ties. The mother slowly losing her mind lead to some interesting ambient dialogue like her asking Lucius to brush his teeth in a loving tone then immediately telling him to bug off because he's creeping her out, it's more than likely a bug but humorous none the less. As far as visuals are concerned, they're entirely fine for the most part, there are moment's when the game can be quite beautiful and others when it looks like a scene from a cut Deadly Premonition level.   The flow they achieve between making the game challenging but not making it frustrating looking for obscure items and solutions to problems are troubling, far too often I had to look up a FAQ on what obscure non related item I needed to complete a task that could have been simply completed another, far simpler way. That also brings out how the limited the game actually is in it's structure and openness to the player, Dante's Mansion, the games only location, is large and sprawling with countless rooms and corridors but most aren't used frequently or at all.  As a closing thought, I did really enjoy the game, the absurdity of the kills and the way the narrative tries to justify 20 deaths in one house as accidents so the detective working the cases doesn't have to call the FBI, is dumb fun, and entertaining. I would recommend anyone who is a fan of the older Hitman games and likes using the environment to kill hapless victims to try this game out, you mind fun for a good weekend of kill all for the glory of old pop Satan.  + Environmental kills are fun and interesting + Graphics are nice in spots and the location is mostly well designed + Interesting idea and premise + Powers can lead to interesting gameplay mechanics  - Story is a little dumb, and stretches the players disbelief far - Voice action and animations are lackluster - Puzzles/Kills can be far too obtuse and can lead to frustration - Limited in it's scope and options to the player  7.5 out of 10
2637	1	a	Twin Peaks teeters on the very edge of exquisite absurdity. Its genius is that it plays both on the level of subtly ludicrous melodrama and on the level of a baffling whodunit, as most lines of dialogue appear to contain a hidden meaning, most faces a dark secret.

1444	0	a	Game breaking bug during Power To The People mission. Stuck at 0% and does not register completed objectives. Since it is a main mission there's no way around it. Neither loading an older save nor restarting the game helped. I even reinstalled and started a new game only to get the exact same bug during second playthrough. There doesn't seem to be any fix for this and the developers don't seem interested in providing it or any information regarding this problem. I can't recommend buying this game under any circumstances.

742	0	a	I was not happy with my old review, so I am making another one. Lucius is a bad game. Lucius is a VERY bad game. In Lucius, your objective is to kill a specific target without being caught, Like in Hitman. However, in Lucius you are given no choice as to how to kill your target. There is only one way to take out your target, and its usually the most obscure, annoying, and hidden way you could possibly imagine. What also sucks is how you never get to 'experiment' to learn your surroundings. Walk up to some guy with a gun and shoot him? Instant game over. You dont get to see the reaction of what you have done, you just get that satisfying 'GAME OVER' we all love. It is also a buggy mess, ive had to repeat levels numerous times because a bug occured making the level unbeatable. Dont waste your time or money.

Since being taken over by another dev, I DO believe this game is great. Thats why I would recommend it, however, take not of my cons CONS: Open World is clunky, and doesnt feel as open as you'd think Only 1 vehicle ? wtf Disconnected Storyline lined with random on the spot sidequests Limited Guns PROS: Great graphics Moderate Difficulty Somewhat smooth combat a HUGE improvement from the 5 hour long original Homefront

292	0	a	 tl;dr -&gt; In Lucius you play as an anti-social devil child who must kill different people in graphicto satisfy your father, Satan. Think Hitman, but if you were a satan-spawn and had much more restricted, linear gameplay.   First off, I want to make clear the fact that I really enjoyed the game and played it to completion, however, I have a very specific reason why I have given a 'do not recommend' rating - which will be explained below. Suffice it to say that I do not support certain types of developer behavior/gameplay mechanics when playing games.  I had the pleasure of having this game gifted to me by one of my very generous friends, and he wanted me to review it once I had a chance to play. Thanks again!   If you enjoy devil/demonic themes, graphic violence and death scenes, and being the son of Satan, than you will enjoy this game.  The aesthetics are good - the detail in the character models and background (ex: rooms of the mansion) are well-done. The music and sounds are good, and the BGM really matches the gameplay and themes - adding to the atmosphere set by the game. The story is okay, but nothing too fancy - you are a demonic child and must kill people to satisfy your father, the devil.   The controls are simple and easy to learn - the tutorials are always quick and helpful. The learning curve is minimal to moderate, the most difficult aspect of the game is probably figuring out the specific ways to kill your targets. To remedy this, you can unlock the music box, which is infused by Satan and will show you 'hints' whenever you activate it. In order to unlock this useful item, you must complete almost all (you can miss/ignore one) available chores in the game. Examples include throwing out the garbage, cleaning your room, and finding your mom's missing earings.  Overall, the gameplay is decent - each chapter requires you to kill someone in your mansion. Admittedly, the regular mansion setting may become boring, however, the game compensates for this by progressively unlocking more parts of the house to be accessible. When you begin a chapter, both your map and journal will help direct you to your target. Usually, you will be given good hints in your journal regarding the next steps to kill your targets. Again, if you find yourself having trouble, work to finish off your chores so you can unlock the music box.   As a devil child, crosses weaken your powers, so you must turn any crosses upside down to negate their effects. As you progress through the game, you will unlock new powers, like telekinesis, mind-erase, and combustion. Tutorials are provided by Satan whenever you receive new abilities. You can fail chapters by revealing yourself - which occurs if you use your powers (primarily telekinesis) within sight of others. Something I liked about the game is how you can do things that make subsequent missions much easier - usually by reducing time. For example, if you like exploring and picking up all available items, you will probably pick up an item that will allow you to progress through a future mission without having to double-back into the house. The house is fairly large, and the map helps a lot in orienting yourself with the landscape.  At the end of the game, you    have one of two routes to select, which changes the type of boss battles you face - I don't believe this changes the ending   . The ending is a bit anti-climatic, but the overall journey and cutscenes are pretty good. A number of the death scenes are fairly graphic, so that is something to be aware of if you are particularly squeamish. There are 20 chapters, allowing for a variety of death types and related puzzles. There is also a    peeping tom segment where you watch a maid taking a bath (you see breasts and some bush)   .  For achievement hunters, achieving 100% is not that difficult, however, there are two extremely ridiculous achievements - one requiring 20 and the other 40 hours of playtime. Note that this DOES NOT mean idling time, but actual game playtime. From what I've read and experienced, you cannot leave the game running with the menu on, or even stand straight. Some people like to have the W (forward) key held down so the character is always walking. Another silly achievement is cycling (unlocked by doing chores) for x miles because the achievement for sprinting x miles can be completed within one or two playthroughs. I have a big problem with this style of achievements because it is essentially gametime mining - and I absolutely HATE artificial-game-lengtheners. If you take your time with the game and do two playthroughs to    try both ending routes, when you could just as easily load the chapter and select the other option   , you could PROBABLY stretch the gameplay to ~10 hours.   The two achievements require 20 and 40 NON-IDLING hours. I find that absolutely ridiculous, given the amount of time it takes to complete the game. As an avid game reviewer, I just cannot accept or support this type of behavior. If these achievements were removed, or reduced to reasonable hours, then I would immediately switch my 'do not recommend' to 'recommend.' Even if you are not an achievement junkie, I cannot encourage this type of gametime farming - because I know there are always people willing to 100% complete a game.   If you like role-playing as the son of Satan, wrecking havoc on your family household in the name of evil, then give this game a try.   Recommend, but DO NOT support stupid game design practices as seen in the achievements.  Cheers, DJSF  @DJSF's Rogue Reviews

I've been in the game for about 19 hours now and seems like i hardly made a dent, its so long but I am planning to beat the game. 6/10..it seems a little rough around the edges, but i mean it has its parts.  Edit: I've beaten the game and i can safetly say its a 9/10 :D.. once you get over the problems and glitches its a really interesting story, it actually made me tear up at the end Q_Q.

Gameplay is like Farcry 3, but not so successful of course. Bad cinematics (u see people hitting other people and it looks fake). Not convincing voice acting, no vibe of revolution. On the other hand nice weapon modifications on the spot, and weapon upgrades. I got tired of it after 7 hours of gameplay

2512	1	a	A good game that does not let you down along the way. It is a steady ride all to the end.  Although, there should be more impacts on what you do and whom you talk to in the game... with all the big warnings at the beginning of the game, I think the designers should have focused more on that than hack'n'slashing.  The game genre is situated between a role-playing (like Arcanum) and an action-adventure like diablo. It is decent enough to try at least once for fans of both genre.  I recommand that you buy this game if you are a fan of role-playing games like Arcanum or action-adventure games like diablo/Dungeon Siege, especially at the low low price on Steam.

1475	0	a	1 HOUR PLAYTIME  Now I write this first review with no hatred whatsoever (unlike everyone else)  The game started with a great opening, the story line is exciting and the opening scene gets you in the zone... My first walk around the neighbourhood was slow... the textures look great, the environment is wonderfully detailed with many unique objects around to complete the immersive experience making the environment feel busy and alive. The main characters so far are all unique and have different personalities... the ambient NPCs are cool too however there is an issue with the rigging as their necks look like they are possessed by a demon... There is also an issue with the NPCs interaction with their environment and other NPCs as I seen 2 of them walking into eachother and continued walking on the spot.  Sounds used in the game are excellent however the fades/crossovers need work, as sounds are often clashing with one another, overpowering or even turning off other sounds altogether. Now I'm not like these other morons out there that say a game has optimization issues because they aren't getting 120FPS, we all know anything over 35 is excellent for gameplay... however this game does have optimization issues, but it's due to the environment being so detailed and RAM consuming... but it does need work because as soon as i got into battle, I couldn't play it... let alone ride a motorbike at full speed... it ruined it for me... I'm yet to turn all my settings to LOW and see how it goes... FYI I'm running Alienware with GTX680 and 32GB RAM... I play the division on mostly high with a couple ultra settings with no slowdown...  Player movement feels very stiff like me on a Saturday morning, interaction with objects and climbable areas sometimes takes a few times to register...  The weapon custimization options are exactly the same as Crisis which I dont mind at all as it's a cool looking system... The graphics are beautiful the plot is excellent and I'm really liking where this is going, as I haven't played a good UPRISING styled game since half Life 2... but right now, where it is... I CANNOT give it a thumbs up... in fact I am very disappointed I purchased this as in Australia, this game costed me $70 AUD but I'm not sure if I want to refund or not... I'm holding the hope that this game will be rescued...  I was a big fan of the first Homefront when noone else even liked it, because it was too linear and short... but it was a good game... I will update this review after a few bug fixes, but right now I just cant play it...   IN FUTURE DEVELOPERS... BE SURE TO QUALITY ASSURE YOUR PRODUCT BEFORE YOU SELL IT... DON'T BE LIKE SO MANY OTHER COMPANIES AND SELL AN UNFINISHED GAME AND THEN HAVE THE CHEEK TO SELL DLCs...  3/10

1503	1	a	With only a taste test so far; a little over an hour in the first Red Zone (Hot zone), I can tell I'll enjoy this regardless of story length. Mainly as it uses mechanics from two of my favorite games (Far Cry 3/4 &amp; Dying Light) in a Red Dawn/Revolution setting that's right up my alley.   Unless this game does a total 360 as I progress, I have no prob recommending to those who enjoy loot shooters at the normal price (39.99). If it does flop as I progress I will definitely alter my recommendation.

2557	1	a	Well, if you are one those people who can enjoy this masterpiece probably you already own this game, I was waiting for this for a long time I have no consoles so I couldn't play it before, I pretty excited when they announced it for steam, I preordered it without much thought, and when game was released it was pretty much unplayable for me, I can say it was worst port I have ever played, well I don't really care about resolution but when console port has no controller support that's just terrible, not to mention it crashed every 5 minutes or so, so I decided to wait, not long after Durante of NeoGAF famous for his dark souls fix has released resolution fix for this game and after that some dedicated users made custom icons for controller and somewhat support of for pads via third party softs. Then there was word that devs were planning to release patch to fix all this mess, and they really did after some time. So it's been a month already after the games release till I could play this game but it was really worth the wait, I was already hyped for this game for a long time but it turned out to exceed my expectations like 10 times, and after this patches game was fully playable with no crashes, controller support and thanks to durante with desirable custom resolutions. I played many games this generation but there were only two games that brought me that sense of excitement and joy of gaming that I had only as a child, first game was Dark Souls, and I thought I wouldn't enjoy anything else like that until second DS game was released, well now as I write this I have completed this game 100% and can safely say that it's definitely is in my top 10 games of all time if not in top 5, it just makes me sad that this masterpiece in not very successful saleswise compared to mainstream 5-7 hour meaningless soulless shooters, but I do hope that as gaming attracts more and more mature audience and is slowly becoming as mainstream as movies, there will be time that developres can take the risks and make games such this one without any fear of failing.
2285	0	a	No, no, no and definitely no. Don't even bother, I can't imagine someone thought people will like 'this'. Has no feel to it, completely generic rip off. Intros you can't skip and a number of issue right at the start.

1987	1	a	Just a quickie on the single player  Like far cry but with a subjectively more interesting setting and motivation offset by poor performance that greatly impacts the flow of gameplay (specifically the shooting). Be ready to run it low in order to preserve framerate (becomes a much better experience) and make the shooting feel a lot better.   Play it for... - the world - the environmental storytelling - the yellow zones  - the general feeling of being a member of an outnumbered and out gunned resistance - chunky guns   be aware of... - â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ AI  - Poor optimisation  - Shallow characters - debatable motorbike handling  - a general lack of polish   If you like to get lost in a world, don't mind making your own fun/ narrative within the loose story and have the hardware to ignore poor optimisation or make it passable then you will probably love the gameplay and feel of it. Ignore the story

2484	1	a	Inquistor is done in the classic isometric style of great 90's rpg's like Baulders Gate or Plainscape: Torment. With a main questline that allows the player to acutully gather evendence, accuse, prosecute and eventually execute heritic's, witches, satanists and other threaths to the church, Inquistor offers something unique and in some ways twistiedly fun. The lack of a tutorial can make the learning curve a bit steep at the start but if you have played the games I mentioned above then it shouldnt take too long to get used to the sometimes clunky UI and figure out how leveling works ect. The storyline is enguaging and adds to the great enviornemnts and atmospheres that are present within allowing for a decent level of immersion that kept me coming back.   One of the issues I had with the game was its lack of direction given in some of the main and side quests. This might just be due to a bad translation as the game was produced and written in Poland and then later translated to English but it seems to happen often. This can sometimes also be seen in the dialoge with converstiaons sounding odd but beyond that having no real other effects I had noticed. Another feature that could be tweeked is the quest tracking and journal system. It would be nice if you cold add your own notes or in the whole converstiaon with people was recoded if it had rellevence to a specific quest. Due to this I sometimes found it hard to leave the game for a few days and pick it back up where I left off. But if you are willing to put in a bit of effort this game will be well worth the time of fans of the classic isometric style of RPGs.
2858	1	a	Gloriously terrible, I had a great deal of fun with this game due to the campy and strange humor that is thrown about in the game. I got hooked on it very early into the game but felt a little let down by the ending, this isn't a game for everyone and it's replay value is very minimal.

2001	1	a	I noticed a lot of negative reviews on here... Still purchased. I have a custom system I built of 2x 980 Ti Hybrids in SLI that are OC and a 4790k on water but stock @ 4 GHz. I'm running 1080p @ 144Hz and I have 32GB RAM. I'm running Nvidia driver version 365.19. I should also mention that my rig has been a labor of love that's been a rollout upgrade since 2014.  Turn off super-sampling and the stupid motion blur so you can play and drink without vomiting and I've had no issues. I ran into several issues with super-sampling and motion blur on but once that was kicked, the game is VERY enjoyable even though it needs to be tweaked. I can't honestly give this a bad review after seeing the graphics and the gameplay. Yes, there are some shortcuts taken that are obvious. However, this team spent a lot of time on this game and to me it shows. I've been able to play this maxed out (minus motion blur and super-sampling) on my 1080p @ 144Hz monitor no problem and even though the voice acting is bad according to some reviews, (BARF who cares) I like the game so far. Once into the game, it strikes me very much like Farcry 4 where you conquer territories (Philly) and upgrade weapons with the option of advancing the main mission at your leasure. I forgot to mention that the Korean voice actors seem spot on!   I'm honestly not trying to come off like a â¥â¥â¥â¥ when I say I have had no issues and I enjoy the game. I've been told that my specs make everything awesome but I assure you that is not the case on custom builds by people like me who know just enough to be dangerous to risk losing lots of money if I failed at the build. Been there, done that. Sometimes different manufacturers products hate eachother and you realize you made a bad decision...  Anyway, I am the honest and dissenting voice it seems and I like this game so far and at this point I would purchase it again. I have had no crashes, no graphics issues other than mentioned, and I love the game so far.  EDIT: Finished the game!! Noticed TONS of FPS issues in late game to the point where the game was not playable at ALL even on my high-end system. I closed the game enitrely and restarted but that didnt help. Only a complete reboot of my rig would allow me to continue at playable FPS. I suspect game data remains in the GRAM and RAM unless a reboot is performed or real-time data is poor and bogs down the system. I still recommend the game but wow did they waste all of that effort with extremely poor optimization. What a kick in the nuts to those hard workers... It's like building a skyscraper on a Jello foundation. Why? Just why? I also find it hard to believe that an employee did not bring up these CRUSHING PROFIT PERFORMANCE ISSUES before release. I know these issues were brought up at BETA from players but for some reason the decision was made to press on and ignore. Seriously, think of the money and accolaids that could have been had if you released a quality product instead of releasing pig vomit performance and play catch-up as you go... Also, a free upgrade of digital crap does not satisfy anybody if you CAN'T PLAY THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING GAME!!

346	1	a	Always wanted to be the little â¥â¥â¥â¥ that you know you were, but didn't want the â¥â¥â¥ whooping if your parents found out? Well this game is for you; going around offing people you don't like or just anyone in general. As the spawn of Lucifer you go around murdering people to send their souls to him.   That's basically it; however the game doesn't hold your hand, even if your stuck on a certain part and have no idea what to do, the game will not give a hint even after 10 minutes. This is where my frustrations lie; I don't want to be going around looking at every little thing that I might be able to use. Even though I game a lot I still consider myself to be a casual gamer, as I don't want to tediously do things such as look around for things to contaminate for example: I knew I had to poison someone and went into the kitchen and couldn't find anything resembling a platter to contaminate. I went onto Youtube and found that it was a basket I had to infect. Keep in mind that this is a rich family and the maid who took the food to the person always had a platter for her!   If you have patience and can get into these kind of games I would recommend it.
4	1	a	Demigod is one of those games which surprised the hell out of me in many ways. From the overall presentation, the graphics and audio and the very fun and addictive gameplay, Demigod is one of the best mixed genre games and a shining example of how great game developers can continue to evolve old ideas into bigger and better games. For players looking for some challenging strategy with an RPG skill system that allows the player to tailor the game to their play style, will find a fun and affordable game with Demigod.Demigod is one of those games which are focused for a restricted community. The game is strategy, but itâs also a role-playing and an action game, and every genre it tries its well executed, offering a deep and engaging on-line gameplay. Not traditional at all, and surprisingly intense.Just make sure you understand what kind of game you are buying and you won't be disappointed.

1612	1	a	User dood1234 couldnt have said it any better. I just finished the game and I feel the same now about it as I did when I first started playing. Here is his review and its spot on.  'I have never written a reivew before because I generally feel like the community or the critics get it right. This game is a different case. This game is so underrated it hurts. I cannot speak for how it played at launch but I can speak to how it plays now. It honestly does something other games dont't, and thats give me a ton of tools but at the same time make me feel like an underdog. In my opinion the shooting is very crisp and strategic. Also the weapon modding is awesome making one gun so much more versitile. Also the story seems decent with a very good setting to boot. The graphics are good but demanding. Because of this if you don't have current hardware you should wait to buy this. so far I am only a few hours in but this feels like a more focused and difficult far cry game. Because of the launch issues this game experienced I think it's reputation got ruined. This is definetly one of those games that needs to be given a second chance because it's to much dang fun not to.' -dood1234

I never got bored with the wide variety of different environments there are. The ambience, visuals, jumps, secret finding, avoiding laser beams, and such combine for a very memorable experience.  My only complaint is that the story is rather pretentious at times and somewhat unsatisfying in the end.  But I still had a blast and was not ready for it to be over when I finished.

2711	1	a	I dunno what to say about this game ecxept... Stiff controls, stiff yesteryears animations and stiff voice acting. But it the atmosphere really reeks of an old classic serie called 'Twin Peaks.' I f*cken' it more than putting my d*ck in a cardboard box full of jelly with strawberry taste.  So if you can put your d*ck in it, 'survive' the controls and all the other crap but really love 'old' thriller games with Twin Peaks homage, then you f*ckin' do it.

2501	1	a	I'm really not sure why this game has such a low Metacritic score. It's an unashamedly 'Baldur's Gate' type old-school RPG with an interesting quest/plot line. Okay the graphics aren't exactly going to make you squirt in your pants but a decent RPG doesn't necessarilly need 'AAA' standard graphics. It's a slow-burner though with instant death to be visited upon the foolhardy wanderer at every turn. I suspect the low score is in part down to people who have rushed to score it after dying at the hands of the first hostile NPC you are likely to meet in the starting villiage. But if you can avoid running into him, and add the two available NPC's in that town to your party before you get to grips with him then you are off and running. There are slight errors in grammar and translation in some of the text but really nothing that will detract from the well laid out depth of storytelling. And the combat CAN seem pretty bland at first. However, it's a perfectly good retro-esque RPG -72%. [get it cheap in the reboot 4.0 bundle on BundleStars]

2841	1	a	Do you want to play a game that feels, plays and tells a story like David Lynch's Twin Peaks? This is it.  But like Lynch's cinematography this game will leave you alone confused after it crashes (which it will - several times), so replay that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ part again and listen to York's babbling - again. So in simple words: this game is poorly made gameplay or mechanics wise, as well as graphics, sound mixing, just everything. The thing is: it tells you a story with rich but utterly strange characters like in Twin Peaks (or in videogames like Alan Wake's Latern Lady), which keeps you interested and motivates you to get through this nightmare of game. Whatever it throws at you, you will still appreciate this game and its charme. For me it's an classic â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ arthouse-trash game. I love it. Isn't that right, Zach?

493	0	a	You command Lucius a child who seems to be under the influence of Lucifer. Lucifer tells you to kill people without getting caught to collect souls for him which in-turn makes you more powerful and you unlock more abilities which Lucifer teaches you.  Sound awesome right? No...  The biggest flaw is this is NOT a horror game like you may think. It's more of a 'mystery game' where you go around trying to find clues on how you are supposed to create each murder. The game is VERY vague with hints, and more often then not, you'll have no idea what you are supposed to be doing causing you to mindlessly search this house until something crosses your mind.   If mystery crime case games are not your thing, I'd suggest staying away from this game...  Although....with a guide it is 'somewhat' enjoyable causing drama, and watching people die as a child. Many games don't include children, and being a child-murderer has a slight charm to it.

81	0	a	Unfortunatly I was quite dissappointed in this game. It has a really awesome look to it and have some decent opening story, however what has unimpressed me is the actual gameplay is like a single-player Dota2, but with a couple of changed. One being that you can summon your own minions to aid you, you can also upgrade your citadel so that the waves of spawn that attack the enemy's spawn get better armour, weapons and units to help give a tactical edge in a sense of Command and Conquer and researching technology, but spending gold to do that means you won't be able to buy items for yourself to equip at the shop.  You have capture points too and as I said this game is fun if you like the Dota2 style and it's got some unique characters and a compelling story, but it's a shame that there is no campaign mode because I would've loved that. The idea that the different worlds would end differently depending on the demigod you chose.  This game really isn't for me, I already have Dota2 and I'm not really a fan of that game either so unfortunatly I'm not going to spend anymore time on this game.

1217	1	a	How many ways are there to kill zombies now? A lot more than there needs to be, thatâs for sure. I was socially inept enough to jump on the zombie bandwagon before it was cool, back before 28 Days Later and the Zombie Survival Guide brought them back from their long post-Thriller twilight. Iâve cooled on them enough that zombies as a bullet point is more likely to drive me away from a game, so keep that in mind while I explain just how much I enjoy Zombie Driver HD.  The main draw of Zombie Driver is the story mode, posing you as a nameless motorist in a city beset by the undead plague. Every mission takes place on the same wide-open GTA-style map, sending you to different areas to rescue survivors, destroy zombie strongholds, or defeat enormous bosses. Ramming is sufficient to splatter most zombies but for bigger targets there are weapon pickups scattered all over, giving you machine guns or flamethrowers to cull the hordes with. Youâll also find repair pickups (which you will need because damage can come in huge bursts) and money, used between missions to upgrade your cars. And that is cars plural, because you unlock sports cars and limos and police cruisers over the course of the campaign. Thereâs not a lot of variety in the missions and the characters are all voiced so badly itâs funny, but they make simple excuses to run over thousands of zombies.  The driving really is the best part of the game, appropriate for a game called Zombie Driver. Your vehicles are different degrees of responsive but all are fast and all make satisfying messes out of the undead. Youâll fight different kinds of zombies including dogs and giant exploders and worse, and they all erupt into fountains of giblets and leave crimson streaks on the pavement. Itâs a viscerally satisfying game, even if the sound effects arenât always up to the task of capturing the slaughter. Weapons do tons of damage and clear out crowds, and you get mounting monetary bonuses for long streaks of carnage. Much like in Carmaggeddon, Itâs easy to lose track of mission objectives just because youâre having so much fun roadkilling things.  The HD in the title does indeed mean this is a remaster of a previous Zombie Driver, but with more going for it than just prettier graphics. The campaign is longer, with a full 31 missions and several new bosses to battle. There are new vehicles as well, which can also be used in the gameâs Blood Race and Slaughter modes. Blood Race is, again, much like Carmaggeddon where you race against other cars, crushing zombies and blowing up your opponents to progress. Slaughter is you against mounting waves of zombies with its own progression system of weapons and upgrades. Youâll find plenty to keep you busy as long as you enjoy plowing through zombies, and when itâs done this well thereâs really no reason not to.
2878	1	a	Deadly Premonition achieved what many â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ games can't do. To keep you seated no matter how abysmal it looks and plays. An absolute purchase to anyone with a guilty pleasure for weird games.
328	1	a	EDIT REVIEW:  Ok.. well there is now an auto save and a save after every chapter. So yeah... this game is excellent. After about 10 minutes, you get used to the controls and then the story captivates you. Played this game at one time. The game makes you think as you try to solve the puzzles to murder all the people in your house. What more could you want?  Oh and the ending... I won't spoil it... but it's great to see this type of ending.!!      ORIGINAL REVIEW: As much as I want to like and play this game, I don't. The story is good, but the controls are a little tricky to get used too. The worst part..? There is no option to save. So you will get so far and have to go for whatever reason, but your game hasn't saved so you can only start from the start again... No thanks. Fix this and I will play it again.
889	1	a	Lucius is more of a puzzle game then anything else. There's 18 chapters in the game and each chapter, your goal is to kill a specific person of the Dante Manor, with the exception that some chapters you kill multiple people. It took me about 7 hours to beat this game and I feel like it was worth the money I spent while it was on sale (I beleive $5). Some missions were pretty easy to figure out while others were mearly impossible because the game didn't give you any sense of direction. In some chapters, you only have to find a couple of things to complete the mission, while others, you have to do a list of things. One thing I kept on forgetting was while playing was combining items, (for those of you who haven't played, you get batteries and a flashlight, you select the batteries and then place them in the flashlight). The games does a lot of combining items to make them useful to you, so make sure you don't forget that! Anyways, the quality of the game was iffy. The details seemed pretty fair, but when it goes to cutscenes where people talk, you can tell they didn't pay much attention to making the mouth open when you hear words. The story line made sence to me, like, you will kill a specific person first and then a character that was related to the person you just killed will get depressed and that would be your next target. Overall, I'd give this game a 5/10. I'm only giving it 5 because the story was short and the game didn't really help me with completing chapters which made it frustrating to figure out.  I would only buy it on sale if possible. There is a Lucius 2 which I'll be playing soon.

1079	1	a	The game was pretty, engaging &amp; overall pleasant experience. I really like the cheeky, yet simple storyline, &amp; exploring is a bunch of fun.   My experience: Personally I love exploring, &amp; I seemed to rush ahead from the story so when I went exploring I would find items or places specified for a chapter, &amp; get confused with the items &amp; places alot. They had a weird balance between being able to interact with some future chapter items, while some not at all, which didn't help me. When the eye icon showed up &amp; I clicked it, for particular things it wouldn't say anything which to me defeats the purpose of putting an eye icon.   Needs fixing: I had trouble at chapter 19 because the head statue I was meant to use didn't spawn in the right spot.  Recommendations: Chores are great, I was able to get all the gifts in the first 2 chapters. Make sure to read the clues carefully, &amp; look around the rooms to find all the items &amp; hints u can find. If u are really stuck hold an item up that u expect to use, &amp; it will give u a indicator to show u where to place it. Use ur abilities wisely &amp; u will do great.

Terrible frames even on low settings with assets not appearing in the world make it a terrible experience. The game bugs does have some funny moments such as your character walking around with an invisible smartphone in a city with no environments even existing. Good thing free wekeends exist.

273	1	a	  Nice game with a good story. Killing all those people in all those different ways was a lot of fun, but it's a bit too limited in that area: each person can only be killed in a single specific way, so there's no room for creativity, although that kind of makes each death a bit more meaningful. There are 2 messed up achievements though: you have to play the game for 20 and 40 hours. It has zero replayability and can be beaten in less than 10 hours, but sure, I'll definitely play it for 40 hours.
484	0	a	I loved the concept - playing as a 'Damian' evil child while hiding your murders is a fun idea, but the game hides puzzle pieces too well while giving you the solutions to the puzzles too easily. I knew exactly what to do, but had no idea where to find the tools to let me do it. That's not fun. Also, this horror genre usually has beautiful children be evil - because the contrast of innocence and beauty with the vile and evil actions is chilling, but the artists for this game made Lucius a dough-faced plumpkin. That and other minor issues like cut-scenes that aren't cut as tightly as they should be hurt this game, but they could easily be overlooked if the puzzle pieces had been easy to find. I like figuring out how to do things, but I became bored immediately when I discovered that the game wants me to search all over for whatever items may be required to pull off a murder.

798	1	a	You play Lucius, on a quest to grow your powers and please your hellish father by giving him souls.. And of course you need to find ways to release those souls!   I enjoyed most of the puzzles and challenges to accomplish this but lost patience with a few. Some of them were obvious but still left a deliciously evil satisfaction when you completed the puzzle. One or two left me without a clue where to begin.. This may have been more me.   The game takes place entirely in the mansion and leaves you feeling lost when you first start to explore (you get a map though!... and a tricycle in which to travel faster at one point too). It felt very open, but the gameplay and story was still linear. You had opportunities to find some objects before they were needed so this was nice during the course of exploring and looking for what you actually did need.  The voice acting was alright, but the faces of the characters were completely wooden. Lucius was completely emotionless.. more statue than evil boy.. But maybe this is part of the 'evil boy' look? I thought Lucifer (wooden) face and voice were the best 3:)  There were only two or three points where being able to run/move quickly and aim correctly were critical... It was a small very minor exercise in frustration to get these parts done right but still done easily. Lucius' running and riding the trike were about as good as you could expect for a puzzle game.  I would probably get this while on sale vs a full price, but if you enjoy short puzzle games like this, then it might be worth your full $19.99. I am definitely excited for the next Lucius game. I hoping the developers add on this and bring us a smoother moving and more complex story with even more challenging puzzle.   8 of 10

2245	1	a	Not the best game ever made but definately not deserving of all the negative rants. GFX are great it runs well on my mid range rig. Weapon choice is limited and the story is indeed a bit dull but you get to shoot a f*ckton of koreans in the face, so props for that. Also not seen any of those countless bugs people are raving about. Sure an npc can block a doorway sometimes but you can also shoot said npc.  Not worth 60â¬ but if you get it on â¥â¥â¥ or instant gaming for half that it's well worth buying.
1391	1	a	A lot of surprising fun. Extremely satisfying to destroy loads of zombies by running over them, shooting them, burning them, blowing them up or doing two or three of those things at the same time. Graphics are great for what it is and there is a bit of nostalgia too, the top down car driving reminds me of Grand Theft Auto 2, the first GTA game I played (lol, I was upset when GTA 3 went to a three dimensial look when it first came out and I was much younger. I thought it would 'ruin' the franchise because I loved GTA2 so much. But then I killed a hooker with a baseball bat and everything was OK, but I digress.)  I don't know if it has multiplayer and dont care as I am one of the 1% who lives in the boonies and can't play games online, but the single player is more than worth it, especially at the sale price of 2 bucks which I got it at. I'm not sure how long it is, im still working through it, but if its currently not on sale there are probably features you'll want to research to decide whether or not to spend 10 bucks on it (I think thats the non sale price).  Storyline is predictable but your not playing it for the story, your playing it to destroy zombies via motor vehicle. Have played it long enough to play the mission were you get to drive the tank and I must say it is extremely satisfying.  This is a good game, especially if you can get it for the sale price of 2.00 bucks or somewhere around there. Even if your not a fan of the zombie genre I would still recommend it. Who knows, maybe you will find you are a fan of the 'running over things and destroying them with fire as well' genre.  Simply: Good game, if you think you'd like it I can almost guarantee you would. I'd recommend more research if multiplayer is a must for you as I know it is for many gamers. Even if thats the case though, the single player is more than satisifying enough. I've used the word satisfying an awful lot in this review which I guess would speak to how much I enjoy the game and murdering zombies. GET THE GAME.
1701	1	a	This game is so close to being a good game. It has stellar graphics, a lengthy not too repetitive campaign, and pretty good cinematics/voice acting. Unfortunately its plagued by just not being polished enough. There's just little things throughout the game like a really inconsistent framerate on my 970, poor auto-saving, and even poor instructions in a lot of sections. There's a lot of side objetctives that really test your intelligence because a lot of times what you're supposed to accompish in order to complete the objective is not clear but I guess some people might actually prefer that style of the game not really holding your hand. Overall I'd say its a decent game that I would recommend but only if you're able to get it at a steep discount. Hopefully the series continues because I do really like the concept of the Homrfront games and I really enjoyed the original for the multiplayer and this game got passed around to a lot of different studios before it was completed so ultimately I think some of the shortcomings have to be forgiven.

1313	1	a	This game perfectly blends old school top down GTA with brutal mass zombie slaughter. You drive cars equipped with machine guns, flame throwers, rockets, shock weapons nitro boosts and more. There are plenty of weapons, vehicles and game modes to choose from. The great thing is that for those that grew up with GTA 1 and 2 on the playstation 1 there actually is a 'retro camera' mode where the free camera will fix itself just as the good old days.  The game is only 10â¬ and when on sale it goes down to 3â¬ INCLUDING all the DLC. This game is dirt cheap even at 10â¬. The story mode is well thought out, voiced, filled with multiple giant maps and a wide variety of different missions. On top of the pretty extensive story mode there are a ton of challenges, zombie killing combo modes and even races! The death races are crazy fun and brutally hard and those alone will keep you busy for quite a while. What's even more incredible is that for that small price tag, you don't only get a game jam packed with content, it actually looks really damn good too! Better than most more expensive games.  It's seriouslt almost a crime not to pick this up, especially when you are running into it when it's on sale.

2289	1	a	I just finished Homefront: The Revolution and wow what an amazing game it was.  I dont understand these reviews saying that they have high end pc's with Titan X and dual 980 with i7 and they cant run the game properly. I have a 970 Strix and a i5 and i had smooth 60fps in ultra settings all the way. The Npc's also seemed fairly aware and not 'stupid' as some might say, for the dificulty i was playing in.  Overall i really enjoyed this game and i recommend you ignore the stupid steam reviews that say the had performance issues (i dont know if youve noticed but everybody has a 2000/3000$ computer on the internet).  If you like Far Cry then you should totally buy this one, the gameplay is almost the same and the story is really good. The overall atmosphere of the game is also great, it makes you really feel like part of a gerilla especially on the later zones where you have to sneak away from guards, etc, and sabotage various things so you can take advantage of them against the enemy. 9/10- A really good time.

2415	0	a	The game could have a lot of potentials, but had some serious flaws with the fundamental game designs. The biggest problem with the game is infinite spawning of enemy NPCs, and the respawn frequency is way too fast. If you want to enter an area that's heavily guarded, you cannot simply clear the area by sniping everyone while being stealthy. The enemies will spawn right back after about 30 seconds. If you're spotted by enemies while you're on a mission, you cannot simply go loud and kill everyone because more enemies will respawn around you right after. You can only run away from them and hide, and hope they'll forget about you. On top of the issue with infinite respawns, your health regenration rate is unresonably slow. The combination of the two problems made me hate the game pretty fast.

The puzzles are clever, the writing is brilliant, the the art is beyond breathtaking, and it all comes together to create something uniquely sublime. There is nothing quite like Knytt Underground, and I have a feeling there never will be.

2625	1	a	I can't think of a harder game to score, so I am glad I stopped giving them this year. The best way I can describe this is L.A. Noire meets Silent Hill, and that is some pretty hefty praise coming from me. The action could definitely be annoying, not unlike Silent Hill, but the story and all of the little touches elevated the game well above the sum of its parts. Looking back, I wonder how many of the deadly sins the 'big bad' committed throughout the game. I could think of a few right away once I realized his persona. My only regret is that I didn't start chasing the side quests early enough to get them all done, and I really can't recommend the experience enough.

1546	1	a	I cant speak to how this game was at launch. I only recently purchased it.  But....  For how well the game engine runs today and the amount of content it provides, gameplay, etc... AND the sale price of $11 - $15 (for game and season pass). This game is a great buy.  It has its quirks, like cut and paste characters sometimes in very close proximity, and a few others, but for the price I paid and how well it runs (Dec 27, 2016) it was well worth it.  Recommended to people who like Far Cry / Fallout 4 / freedom (open world / open zone) types of games. Its kind of a mix of all those games.  I do feel for those that paid the full price for game + season pass (and launch issues), but so far (today) the game seems to run great and well worth the $11 - $14.

1471	0	a	It is huge step up from how I remember the first being, the open world and revolution are a nice touch but its just so easy. On the hardest mode the AI has no other moves then get in cover and call for more people to get in cover, although you take a decent amount of damage it doesent change how overpowered your weapons are and how easy it is to upgrade everything. Half way through the game I ended up in a new yellow zone that 'Isnt like anything you've seen'.... it was alot more pretty for about 2 minutes before i hit a couple of radio's.... if thats all the revolution needed then why the â¥â¥â¥â¥ are we trying so hard to save this dude. I dont think i'll end up finishing this just because it wasnt very challenging at all, If the end turns out being you're all we ever needed I wouldnt be suprised though. In the end even with the extra mechanics it felt like a watered down division.  Just a sidenote almost all the negative reviews mention bugginess which i cant comment on, worst thing I came across was terrible AI popin, half a block away stuff would spawn and despawn, but the actual game seemed to play fine, might be an issue related to certain people?

2446	1	a	Awesome game, unless you donÂ´t like to read, letÂ´s make it clear from the start.  ItÂ´s a game for you if you really like RPGs, and by that I mean, playing a role in an amazing story, with complex characters, motive, and storyline in general.  Dialog takes time, thereÂ´s a lot to ask, and all NPCs have distinct personalities, opinions, and clues (except for those labeled with generic names, like soldier), and it really sets the dark mood of the inquisition times. Everyone is afraid of ending up a suspect of heresy, and they are all more then willing to spread rumors about their neighbours.   ItÂ´s set in the middle ages, and you play as a menber of the holy inquisition (at least playing as a priest, there are 3 classes, priest, paladin and thief, so I assume they have different backgrounds), but in the game thereÂ´s magic and monsters.  There are 6 different scholls of magic to choose from, and many skills. All of wich you can upgrade as you level up, along with your attributes. One of my favorite parts in an RPG is the character creation, and this game does a good job at that, you can see thereÂ´s replayability in a game when you go through it wondering how it would be like playing a different class, and that sure happens here. For instance, everyone calls me father, and I get to paternalize everyone, or even offer to hear confessions, stuff like that. I wonder how is it like as a thief, itÂ´s bound to be very different, the dialogs at least, and thatÂ´s the real core of the game, dialog. Imagine an awesome book, where you get to play as the main char, this is not actually labeled as a visual novel, but from a certain point of view it could be. combat and graphics are simple, but thatÂ´s not what matters in this game, would you judge a book by itÂ´s graphics?   ItÂ´s a masterpiece.   One complain though, theres a nice soundtrack but itÂ´s sporadic, sometimes IÂ´m reading a dialog for 15 minutes and thereÂ´s no background music playing at all, then it starts for a while, then stops again. whatÂ´s up with that?

3074	0	a	This game doesn't work. It looks very fun, but I can't play it. The many of the controls in the options simply say 'error.' I have browsed forum after forum, swapped out and editted files as instructed, but still no controls. Can't transform. Can't open inventory. Can't play.  Even after multiple fresh installs, this game is unplayable.  0/10 No controls. I will be happy to change this review if I can control it one day.
3049	1	a	I cannot recommend this game enough.   The Knytt franchise at this point has gained a good bit of history. Underground's predecessors might even be older than some of the folks reading this review. Fortunately, they are all available on the developer's website, free of charge. Since 2006, I've played them many times; seriously, they're some of the most charming games out there. If you're on the fence about this title, look up Nifflas and give Knytt Stories a test drive - you won't regret it.  Knytt Underground is a game of simple two-dimensional platforming and exploration, broken up into three chapters. The first two chapters are short mini-stories introducing your characters - one, a humanoid who can scramble up walls, and the other, a strange ball with elastic properties. The third chapter is the main draw, and has the two main characters join forces to accomplish a great quest. The quest itself is basically a series of mini-fetch-quests, but that hardly matters. The fun comes from exploring the enormous, intricate map. Level design seems relatively minimalist, but the gradual change from region to region, and the charming, easter-egg like decorations on every screen are the real reward. Expect a lot of soft, ambient lights, soothing sounds and music, and a satisfying, effortless grace to your navigation. There's no frustration here, and navigation is pure joy.  If you're coming for hardcore gaming, I'd stay away; this is not that game. Also, don't expect much in terms of story; Underground has inexplicably included a couple of fairies to join you on your grand adventure; neither of them are very interesting, none of the dialogue is well-written, and one of them has a penchant for dropping F-bombs, detracting from the family-frendliness of the game. It's kept to a minimum, though, so it's not enough to detract from such a joyful exploration experience. Give the original Knytt games a go, and if you love them as much as I do, go ahead and get this, too. Support this developer. This is every bit as good as I was hoping, and I would love to keep revisiting this series for a long time to come.
1379	1	a	Not bad game but the trading cards have horribly price.
1633	1	a	This game had a messy launch but thankfully that's not the case now. I purchased the game + expansion pass at 50% discount and I am not disappointed. The story is so so... but the gameplay hooks you in. This game plays like it is part Dying Light (Climbing, Jumping, Activating towers etc) and part Battlefield (Gunplay) along with Crysis like weapon modification on the fly. The open world divided into several sections look really detailed and give the impression of a city in revolution. The animation look good but there are some minor glitches here and there. I will now try out the DLC's and the Co Op mode. Overall a good game. Purchase when its on discount.
957	1	a	I love watching peopleplaying the game. I don't like to play it myself. I love killing people, this game is funny and brings up good jokes on the way. But, since the game is old, I find the controlring system kinda annoying and buggy sometimes... Still recommending this game for people who want to record for youtube or play with friends!

This unqiue ambient relaxation between the art and the gameplay fit so well in something beautiful that I really have never seen so well done. Definitely a game to pick up. It's a very cheap price and I can definitely see myself playing this game for hours and hours and hours. Something I cannot find the words to explain, only the words to implore you to take a step into. I guarantee you will enjoy the experience.  Edit: Just noticed my hours played count is bugged. I've played through the whole thing - definitely took more than three hours, haha. Sorry about that.
1034	0	a	Game has a good idea but unfortunatelly it is too lineer. 
2022	1	a	First off this game is not as terrible as everyone makes out. If you can look past the terrible story line and the poor graphics optimisation the game is fun, the open world combat is good, and weapon customisation is nice. I wish there was more weapons though. It can be challenging at times which is good because most shooters these days such as BF4 and COD are just not challenging enough. Being able to recruit soldiers to fight with you is good aswell.  I don't recommend paying full price for this game as there are better games out at the moment for the same price. This game in my opinion is much better than Rainbow Six Siege and The Division which were huge disaspointments for me.

462	1	a	You are Lucius Wagner, a 6 going on 7 year old demonic boy. Your goal is to kill your family and everyone inside your mansion. Your father is running for senate, but with all the death going on inside his home, he fears he will lose. Nobody suspects that a 6-7 year old boy has the capability of commiting over 15 murders.  The game took me about 8.5 hours to beat and get 56 of the 58 achievements, the two I didnt get being the 'Play 20 Hours' and the 'Play 40 Hours' achievements. It was fun while it lasted, but paying $20 for a game that took 8 hours to beat seems a little overpriced. It has a good story, and its extremely fun and intriguing, but I wish it lasted a bit longer. It would be worth every penny if it was only $10.  
1517	0	a	As of 1.06 (August 9th, 2016) there's still an absurd amount of bugs and glitches - Varying from massive graphical artifacts, animations going nuts to triggers not working. There's a decent game in there, but it's really not worth the effort reaching it at this point.

303	1	a	Quite an entertaining game. Would certainly recommend if found in a bundle or on sale. Puzzles and gameplay are fairly simplistic, but the entertainment for me came from the darkness of it. You are running around as an evil child...  For achievement hunters: Easy 100%. A small guide or couple of play throughs with plenty of exploration is needed. A full play through doesn't take many hours.
1354	1	a	Zombies flood the streets and the city's last hope is apparently someone in a taxi cab.. It's stupidly fun and there's blood splatter everywhere, especially when you mow down hoards of zombies with your vehicle. The view is an overhead topdown kind of view so the camera can be a bit awkward sometimes if you back up too close to a building. The voice acting in this game is also hilariously bad but considering this game doesn't seem to take itself too seriously I'll let that slide. If you like the idea of clearing the streets with a flamethrower equipped limo then this is your game!

1025	1	a	I thought this game was rad, it lived up to my expectations 100%. This game has an awesome cinematic feel, and the visuals are pretty damn good. The voice acting is lackluster at most points, but there's occasionally a shred of real emotion and that's pretty nice.  The puzzles are pretty neat too, there's a lot of forshadowing (whether on purpose or not) due to being able to see what you can use your abilities on, so it's pretty satisfying to finally use something you've had in your inventory for a while, Although it can be a pretty big boner to realize you need to go find an item you should have already come across. A couple of the puzzles seemed pretty obtuse and confusing, but I get that way with most games like this so that might be just me THANKFULLY the game offers a pretty basic hint thingy which is optional so you don't have to deal with spoiled answers!   The only reaaaaaal downsides I have to say are that there are definitely some glitches. I've been launched through the stairs quite a few times and while it's hilarious it's also inconvenient, but I don't remember having any gamebreaking bugs or anything. Also for being sort of presented as a sandbox, the game is linear as hell and there's no room for variation which kinda sucks but it's still fun figuring out all the prebuilt sequences. Thankfully I hear the sequel is truly openended and has traps and such so heyyyyyyyyyyyyy  I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE SEQUEL BECAUSE THIS GAME IS GOOD AND I WANT MORE

119	1	a	If you enjoy League of Legends or DotA in any way, this is a good stand-alone game that takes those elements, adds great graphics, more diverse skills and trees for heroes, upgrade system to the Citadel (base), and even has some light RTS elements controlling minions (depending on if you pick an Assassin or General). It's not 100%, but it's cheap and has great potential!

1450	1	a	- While the story is predicatable, the story is still good. - AI; the AI is pretty good, and underrated. - Although the missions can get repetitive, they are still fun because you can complete them in a number of ways. - Graphics are good, but not very optimized. - Devs are working to help fix the problems.  - Map is large, and fun to explore.   7/10: It's a fun far cry like game, that is unoptomized, but the devs are working to fix it. If you want it, I suggest waiting for a sale.  Edit:  - Patches have been put it, most notably the 2.0. - I believe that the game has been optimized better.  I'd still reccomend looking for a sale.

2144	1	a	To be honest, I don't understand why this game has so many bad reviews. It is an excellent release, worth every penny. What they accomplished, being in the shoes of the resistance fighter, was done extremely well. This is not Doom or Call of Duty and even thinking about comparing to those is plain silly. You will not be fighting waves of enemies like Rambo. If you attempt to do so, you willl die very quickly. You are supposed to be adopting guerilla tactics, which involves a lot of hit-and-run, outsmarting the enemy, etc. It is an FPS in its own right and big props to the devs for getting it right. Also many concepts were borrowed from later Far Cry games, such as visibility indicators and take-downs and having played all Far Cry games, starting with first one, I can't say this is a Far Cry clone.  I hear many people are having performance issues. I am running it on MSI GS60 pro gaming laptop with 970 and it runs very smoothly, with the exception when the level has just loaded. I don't see any framerate drops and run on the high settings. Graphics are pretty good as well, not the best though.   The only complaints are NPC animations, which look a little clunky, especIally of other resistance fighters. Maybe also having an ability to drag bodies away would help, especially in yellow zones. AI can be stupid sometimes, where you can corner them in a small hallway with nothing else but a knife. In one of the yellow zones I managed to slice up about 15 or so soldiers with a little health damage. In an open firefight they are generally pretty good, hiding behind covers and flanking more often than not.  Would I recommend buying it? Hell yes! If you are concerned about price, you can get an activation voucher in other places for less.

2445	0	a	Inquisitor is a great idea. Poorly executed. Don't get me wrong, I'm playing the game, I'm almost a dozen hours in and it's somewhat challenging, however the mechanics are poorly designed. Here's an example: you don't need the identify skill because you can cast a spell that identifies everything in your inventory. You must swap out spells from your quickslots(of which there just aren't enough) mid battle, which can be pretty annoying and can get you killed quite easily. For a game the devs spent 7+ years on(they say 2 or 3 of translations I think) they really didn't do very well. This game deserves its metascore, but you really can't go wrong for 10 USD, it's still fairly fun. It's just very gimmicky and like I said, the mechanics suck at higher levels.

3013	1	a	Deadly Premonition is one of those games that defies description. I could write pages and pages and it would still not capture the experience that is playing this game. Just playing this game is a labor of love. There will be times when you hate yourself for deciding to play it (usually after it crashes and you realize you haven't saved in forever). There will be times when the wonky game mechanics will frustrate you to no end. Even before you play the game you will likely already regret buying it when you can't get it to work properly and have to comb through forums to find the fix to your specific problem. However, if you can push through the many absurd flaws that this game has you will be rewarded with a truly unique experience. It is certainly not something that everyone will enjoy, but I think that it is worth giving it a shot.  Likes: Unique experience, funny and fairly decent story and dialogue, good soundtrack, very ambitious in scope  Dislikes: This game has so many issues I couldn't even list them all, game mechanics are often executed poorly, fairly dated visuals, Can be repetetive if you only do main story  Feeling a strong 8 to a light 9

282	1	a	Lucius was born on the June 6th, 1966 and he was just a regular boy until his 6th birthday, when his true identity was revealed by his true father, Lucifer who instructed Lucius to orcastrate the deaths of the mansion's residents without anyone suspecting him, granting Lucius supernatural powers as he succeeds. The concept is interesting, the graphics and soundtrack are quite good, the gameplay is great and the story is intriguing. Despite all the controversy surrounding this game for obvious reasons, I still recommend it.

1441	1	a	This game is briliant fun and that's the key word- FUN!  I didn't know much about it, but bought it during a Steam sale for Â£1-09 sterling, very cheap including all the DLC.  There is a campaign mode, a slaughter mode and a racing mode. So far, i've only played the campaign mode.  I use an XBOX One controller under Windows 10 without issue.  The gameplay is frantic, yet easy to deal with. Plenty of gore, pickups and great visuals. The overall presentation, including the music reminds me of an AAA release.  If you want an immediate, fun game for not much cash, then take a look at this game.  Thanks.

929	0	a	Bought this game on sale because it seemed interesting. I lost interest the moment the bugs kicked in. I've had framedrops on cutscenes, a bug which forced me to redo several chapters due to picking up an item too early and the game not recognizing it being picked up.  Overall this game isn't worth the 21.99 it's listed and it's definetly not worth most people's time.

2620	1	a	York is the greatest video game protagonist of all time and Deadly Premonition's story, characters, humor, atmosphere, soundtrack and sheer personality are way above what you will find in most critically acclaimed titles. It's not without its flaws, like a subpar combat system and bad graphics (even for the time), but it's totally unique and isn't afraid to experiment, something sorely lacking in other games.  If you own a Xbox 360, play the regular version there instead of this one. The little improvements of the Director's Cut aren't worth it, since this port suffers from common crashing issues and some bugs.  However, a bad port is still better than not playing Deadly Premonition, so if this is your only option of experiencing the game, go for it. Just be aware of the following:  - Check  the PC Gaming Wiki  [pcgamingwiki.com]  and its tutorial on installing DP Fix, SweetFX, better textures and solutions for crashing;  - Always run the game directly through DP.exe instead of Steam or other methods;  - In order to get an item that will make navigating through the game much easier and more pleasant, do Side Missions No. 004 &amp; 005 (George's sidequests) as soon as possible;  - Do not read the description of the Trading Cards before finishing the game, since some of them contain spoilers.   F... K... In the coffee! It never fails.

1027	1	a	The Game Is Awsome Butt You Better Have Nice Computer Because it lags
1069	1	a	This game contains some of the most old school and classic deaths ever just. wow i haven't seen those deaths since Tom &amp; Jerry but instead now the victims actually. But admit it you probably jsut buyed this game because of the nudity didn't you, you probably got a dirty mind. well atleast you didnt't come for the story because that is â¥â¥â¥â¥. it develops poorly let me tell you the story and how it develops. Warning: absolutely jsut boring spoil;ers you probably already new. you turned 6 years old and find out you're the devils son great now go kill people in your household because your dad wants you to that. thats litarelly it. nothing changes! but ofcourse you came here to mess around or for the nudity. you probably came for the nudity (pssst the sex scene is random and the shower scene is at chapter 14 but you haven't heard that from me). and most importantly its a fun game, well if you have dark humor like i do its fun. the gameplay is oke to i guess doesn't have any replay value theres no secrets well theres one but you get there via story progression but for an open world game the fact that theres no secrets just dissapoints me.  +Old School Deaths for all the people who came out there mother before the year 2000. +â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ +Naked Woman, Shower, nuff said. +Fun for people with a dark sence of humor. -â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ story -No replay value  The game is fun and hilarious but if it had a better story or even the slightest bit of replay value it would had been a higher score. 6/10. The potentiol is there but the developers missed there change. i don't have much hope for the sequel being any better or even good at all but for that we have to wait and see.
1445	0	a	Warning!: This review will be in depth, and I will not include a tl;dr  After spending 13 hours with the main campaign, and finishing it, Homefront: The Revolution is easily one of the worst games I have ever played, but unlike most of the negative reviews for this game, I am going to give legitimate reasons as to why I feel this way  Before I get into the review, I would just like to say that before I purchased this game, I was one of the naysayers who defended it, beliveing that the game wasn't as bad as everybody said it was, but after buying and playing it, I hate to say that I agree with (most of) what people are saying  Onto the review   Pros 1. 2 Characters (Notice how I said 2, and not characters in general). Only 2 characters throughout this entire game were above the level of 'bareable'. Jack is the buddy/dudebro of the game, the guy that cracks jokes, kicks â¥â¥â¥, and is just fun to be around. Dana is batshit, but the good kind, the kind that makes the inner psychopath in you say 'I would totally do that!'. The rest are outright boring and flat, and when characters die you don't feel anything for them  2. The setting: Dambusters recreation of Philadelphia feels alive, and is bursting with personality. You actually feel as if there was a huge war, and that the KPA is a formidable force to be reckoned with, although I found the minimal refrences to historical monuments/figures odd for a city full chocked full of them  3. Alternate future: Since this game is based in an alternate future, it is plausible that the North Koreans were able to take over America, unlike the first game  Cons 1. The story: convoluted and uninteresting. It isn't easy to follow, nor do you feel very invested in it 2. The gameplay: combat is extremely clunky, (you get used to it over time), and because of this, it makes slogging through the games campaign all the more painful 3. Braindead AI: The AI is extremely stupid, the only way you get killed by them is if they swarm you, and this happens more often than not 4. Stealth is a no go: Killing a KPA soldier, even with a silencer, sends off an imediate alert that, instead of making nearby soldiers investigate your position, instantly spawns in enemies that start drilling you with bullets. Stealth is essentialy a terrible tactic, and the whole system needs an overhaul 5. Rinse and repeat objectives: So essentially to finish the story, you need to capture different points within the hub worlds, which then unlock the next mission in the story. The problem with this is, that is literally what you do for the entire game. It boils down to: Go here, clear and capture all of these points, then do the story mission(s), repeat. This gets extremely repetitive, and even borderline annoying, coupled with the fact that the gunplay is terrible makes it all the more dreadfull 6. Bugs galore. Whether it be floating pedestrians, stuttering or un-capturable points, this game is filled with a ridiculous amount of bugs that will end up frustrating you to the point where you don't want to play the game anymore 7. Phantom 'Open-world'. This games is NOT open world, like Fry Cry is open world. It is filled with 'hub worlds'. Think Dragon Age Inqusition type hub worlds.  8.Brady do this, Brady do that. BRADY, BRADY!: The games characters rely on you WAY too much, making you feel like you are the de-facto leader, and/or errand boy, when you are just another soldier fighting with the resistance. I get that you are playing the protagonist, but the game doesn't present you as anyone special, just another soldier, so another resistance fighter could easily do what you do 9. Resorting to Call Of Duty tactics: The game tries its best to paint your charatcer as a guriella fighter, and in the beginning of the game it does that. You will have low ammo, low health, and have to scavenge to craft items like molotovs or RC bombs that give you an edge. But by mid-game, you will have upgraded your character enough to where all of that gets tossed out the window, and you can essentially go rambo and just run in and gun soldiers down. Yes, you could 'role-play' as a guriella fighter, but the annoying AI doesn't/won't make you want to 10. Same-y enemies: It's essential the same enemy type over and over with no variation, and this really emphasizes that feeling of boredom you will eventually get 11. Moral argument: This one is personal, but I found the moral arguemnt discussed by a ceratin character in the game to be extremely annoying. His argument is basically 'see, this is what happens when you cause trouble!' I'm sorry, I didin't realize that a revolution was going to be PEACEFUL, when we are stock pilling weapons, ammo and materials for a godamn war. 'People get hurt' Well no duh, it's a freaking war for freedom, don't like it? Shouldn't have signed up in the first place.  12. Phantom 'Customization'. The 'on the fly' gun customization intially shown for this game is a ruse. There are few weapons to choose from, your setup will most likely end up being an SMG, Assault Rifle, and an RPG. There are few upgrades/attatchments that make each weapon feel unique, although there are some interesting conversions, maybe 2 or 3, but you will always end up switching back to the setup stated above 13. Compensation for braindead AI will make some missions difficult: In certain missions, the game will spawn endless hordes of enemies to compensate for their lack of good scripting/coding, and more often than not this makes missions a pain, especially missions where you need to defend something, or you have resistance fighting with you and they get mowed down 14. Poor character animation and lip sync: The characters animations are absolutely atrocious, espesially for a game released in 2016. Mass effect, yes the original, has better animations than this 15. Game breaking bugs: I haven't experienced this, but I know some people who have run into a bug during a certain mission that does not allow them to progress at all, making the game basically unplayable, besides co-op 16. Side missions: A complete waste of time, and unrewarding 17. Graphics: Graphics are generally good (that's cry engine for you) but some low res textures are pretty noticable  Things not mentioned: Multiplayer: didn't bother to try it, didn't feel like it would justify a 60$ asking price Season pass: not sure what they will include, but I know some people enjoy this game, so I won't tell you not to buy it  Final verdict: 2/10 Purchase recommendation: Do not pruchase, at all, not even on sale  I really wanted to like Homefront: The Revolution, I was part of the minority who didn't write off the game, and wanted to give it a chance, but sadly, that didn't happen. This game would have honestly done better as a linear shooter, because the main missions were easily the best part of the game. Sad to say, but in terms of overall game design, the original Homefront was leagues better than this game. Say what you will, but the original had better writing, an interesting story, great characters, great mechanics/gunplay, and included a Battlefield/CoD like, PvP centered multiplayer that gave it longevity and spawned a cult following. Dambuster essentially butchered that, and I fear this is the end of the Homefront 'franchise' (if it was ever one) and should be laid to rest

2442	1	a	 Positives   + Complex and engaging storyline. Well constructed plot with lots of twists and turns. + A stiff challenge, without being impossible. There is always eventually a way to progress from even the toughest situation. + Somewhat addictive. Despite the awkward controls and combat, I couldn't help but keep coming back to the game. + The negative effects system on the player character was a nice touch. For example, suffering from blindness would make the mouse cursor disappear, or confusion would reverse the mouse controls. + Very much enjoyed the trial system of collecting evidence in order to put a suspect on trial. The torture system is also very creative and interesting (as well as being sadistically realistic!)   Negatives   - Bugged beyond belief! So many irritating bugs, some of which will crash to desktop or require and emergency exit. Save regularly. - Numerous spelling and grammatical mistakes. Some sections have not translated into Englsih well at all. - Awkward combat system. Some of the combat skills don't appear to work (or have so little effect as to make them not worthwhile investing in), item damage is somewhat inconsistent and unrealistic and many encounters felt like just a health and stamina potion loading exercise to survive. - Was not keen on the randomised stat attributes on weapons and armour, which can result in the player spending hours cycling through merchant stocks until they chance upon their desired item. There is no levelling to this process, so as soon as you are able to wield/wear the item, you could effectively receive the most powerful of its type which would last you through to the end of the game. The randomisation can make powerful , unique items that you receive as late game quest rewards significantly less useful than an item you picked up in the first act.   Overall   Despite all my gripes, I have to recommend the game, as I have enjoyed playing it very much. It hooked me in and the storyline was particularly engrossing. However, I constantly find myself thinking up ways in which the game could have been done better - there are so many things that werenât quite taken advantage of. I'm hoping that a sequel is on the cards, as with a little polishing and ironing out of some issues, there is potential for a real quality game here.
2343	1	a	Highly recommend this game. It has some flaws but can be fixable in the future updates. The game makes you feel like you are an actual american taliban fighting against the north koreans, out numbered, outgunned and hopeless. This game is a 9.5/10 for me. I would recommend buying it. And the visuals are really good too.

84	0	a	Crap. MOBA with terrible controls, slow progression and woeful un-changeable controls.
934	0	a	The concept is brilliant! Sadly the pace of the gameplay is too erratic to hold my interest.   Long periods of point-and-click style play happen between tasks/murders which vary in difficulty, seemingly at random. Generally in games keystage challenges become exponentially more difficult, but in my (short) exploration of this one it seems one task can be virtually impossible to complete followed by a task which is ludicrously simple.   It is challenging, in some instances overly so; actions expected of the player can be very obscure with no hints, once you've finally figured out what you have to do it can then be a feat of superhuman dexterity to complete your mission... creaing a serious anticlimax. It is frustrating and slightly tedious in alternating intervals. This is not helped by the fact the game mechanics appear to struggle with a controller, there are a great many graphics glitches, odd bouts of lag, and reloading from a checkpoint takes a very long time.   Perhaps the game is just older and I am being unfair. It is also possible that I'm just not suited to this type of puzzle solving as, to be candid, this game very quickly felt like a chore rather than a joy which is a pity because, as I said, the concept is awesome.
847	1	a	Low budget and somewhat on the easy side (took me just about 5 hours to beat) but if you are a fan of horror movies like The Omen (which is the obvious inspiration here) I recommended it on a sale price.

1630	0	a	Now with extra bugs... a short one-hour DLC broke the multiplayer, hope it will be patched soon...  Only recommended for fans of open world shooters if on sale at &gt;50% off.   The bad: - Rushed release with all the bugs you'd expect: Poor detection, crashes, getting stuck in the interface in-game, regularly falling through the floor, failing to trigger melee takedowns and being gunned down as a result... I could go on and on and on. - Campaign with a generic story that packs very few emotional punches. - Rushed multiplayer and really lackluster matchmacking... probably the reason why so few people are available for matches.   The good: - Brutal start to the campaign, very atmospheric and dark, has that oppressed vibe like City 17. - The apocalyptic warzones / red zones are the highlight of the game and feature some fantastic level design (especially for the multiplayer missions). - Decent shooting mechanics and creative weapon animations.

1582	1	a	I see a lot of negative reviews on performance of this game. I experienced none of these.  I Looked over the patch notes and it seems the problem was solved shortly before I purchased.    The Good   1. First off the game looks absoulutly amazing. 2. Excellent and extremly detailed area designs. 3. After liberating a stronghold or area it changes.  4. Story Is pretty decent and tons of content.  5. Character models / clothing are very detailed.  6. Able to customize guns on the fly. 7. Can recruit people to help you fight and they are viable.  8. Concept and atmosphere.   The Bad  1. Not enough equipment. 2. Not enough guns. 3. Not enough unique upgrades. 4. There needs to be more npc character models for civilians.  5. I would have liked to see more types of vehicles. 6. No skill tree in single player. 7. Stealth is lacking.  8. Game still has Bugs and ai issues. Though, none stopped my progression.  Overall i'd still recommend. I got it on sale and don't regret it at all. Having a blast so far, and you can really see that the hard work and effort put into this. 7.5 / 10. Wish they would have skipped the co-op and focused on development and progression of single player.  On a side note. Session pass does not give all content. Didin't like that one bit.
1302	1	a	An honest brutal title to this game that you can't help but admire, The game that wastes time deliverying or experimenting with some new turn on dispatching contemporary gaming's most overuse ememies, It's basically just you and your car on a familar birdseye view format nostalgia on the early years of Grand theft Auto and the whole population full of zombies and some surviours in the whole state. Over the course of the game you smash through them causing a lot of destruction with weapons and choses of cars and school buses, fry them with flame throwers and rocket launchers and leveling up as you proceed further in the game. The game itself is quiet imaginative and creative all around, it's stupid and unrealistic, gory and quiet fun.
4019	1	a	 Early Access Review
2410	0	a	  Alright so, let me give full disclosure to start, I played this game in the free weekend that Steam offered on the 9th-11th September.   First of all, there were things to enjoy about this game. The gameplay wasnât too bad - Far-Cry esque in an occupied city where the underground revolution (you) has to take down the occupants he can, destroy their equipment and earn his freedom. It was almost Terminator 2 like, popping out of a ruined building to lob a pipe-bomb at a passing mech and quickly get back down to snipe a few soldiers advancing towards you.  The exploration, taking over districts by doing a variety of different tasks (Strike Points through hacking, killing soldiers stationed there, finding HAM radios, etc.), helping civilians there, and a number of collectables (radios, propaganda speakers, fuel storage tanks) - all of this was fairly enjoyable. I like open world gameplay where you start off outnumbered and hopeless and become the main force by the end of the game - standard linear progression yes, but it makes for a fun experience of being the hero.  The story is an interesting concept. North Koreans started up the tech giants, Americans flooded to buy their gear (computers, tablets, phones, and even military equipment) only for it all to have a backdoor allowing NK to easily invade. The large zeppelin airships that watch over cities, looking out for trouble with their spotlights which you have to avoid (or be faced with endless soldiers until you get to safety/hide somewhere), patrolling armoured vehicles and mechs, it was all pretty cool and eerie.  Graphically, this game looks pretty good. Textures are nice, effects are pretty good, once you get into an area thatâs been gassed you get to see all the particle effects of toxins in the air and all the dust from the dilapidated factories and structures that are in the area.  Though of course, this is a negative rating Iâm giving. And itâs probably expected. The performance.  The performance can be pretty abysmal at times - even on a pretty good machine (i7-6700k, GTX 980ti, 16GB RAM). It started off alright, but frame drops can be frequent (be warned, CLOSE ALL BACKGROUND PROGRAMS. I had YouTube open on my other monitor to watch some stuff whilst I took over districts and my framerate tanked hard - dropping to unplayable rates and stuttering every 10-20 seconds sometimes). It gets worse the longer you play - I recommend restarting the game now and then whilst you play so it doesnât tank as hard.  The game also gets glitches. One strikepoint was unavailable to me (chop shop) and it appears to be a common occurrence according to the Internet. I had to download a trainer to allow me to float upwards (cheat my way basically) up and through the side of the building as the garage door refused to open once the generator was running. I also spawned once in a mission with no resistance soldiers with me - facing a few dozen NK soldiers, the game then gave me a game over screen as my âresistance soldiers had diedâ when they never even spawned in game. Achievements are also pretty glitched. They stop tracking when you play, so there are quite a few I am missing which I clearly achieved (I liberated all Strike Points, freeâd every district yet apparently I barely got over half of them according to the Steam achievement tracker. Several other ones didnât unlock either).  If this game got fixed - polished up a bit with the performance optimised and the glitches buffed out Iâd buy this game no problem. It seems alright - itâs not too long but itâs long enough and doesnât outstay itâs welcome at all and is what youâd want out of this style of game. Too long and it drags on. The devs seem pretty honest people, with the credits opening with some story about the development problems that plagued this game, and even after all the disasters post-launch they are doing things to progress it a bit at least. Time will tell, if the problems do get fixed then this will change into a positive review for sure.

Is it the atmosphere? Is it the narrative? Is it the characters?  This game is a hit or miss. You either like it or not. As for me, well, I became obsessed with this game while I played it and while I didn't...so much that I went for the 100% completion.

803	1	a	It's better conceptually than it is in execution. The house is in essentially the same state for a majority of the game, and even though months have passed by in game, some characters stay in the exact same spot saying the exact same things until you end up killing them. It's a good thing that figuring out the murder puzzles and be quite fun and challenging at times.  Lucius reminds of the old flash games I'd play, but the graphics and mechanics are obviously way better. Much like those games, though, I wouldn't expect to get more than a day's worth of fun out of it.  Try it out. Kill some people. Witness the storyline. Expect to uninstall it because there's not that much replay value. It's worth it for a run through, though.

3037	1	a	First of all, although I haven't played much of this on PC I have completed the game on Vita and from what brief playtime I had on the PC version there doesn't seem to be any differences. One thing I would recommend is playing in windowed mode as the graphics appear stretched in fullscreen.  Knytt Underground is one of my favourite games that I have played this year, totally unexpectedly. I came into this thinking I'd mess around on it for half an hour but what I found is one of the most deep and immensely enjoyable puzzle exploration 'complete the map' games I have ever played. I can't really explain it, but I found the mechanics really fun and easy to get the hang of yet difficult to master and the game has an unexplainable charm to it that I haven't found in many other games this year. Initially in the first two chapters the game seems small and limited, but this is simply a tutorial or prologue if you will to the massive chapter 3 which is when the whole game's map opens up. It's addictive to try and discover and explore each of the grids in the game's map system and to discover the secret and story behind each area. Many areas involve puzzles which make use of enemies and hazards and the game's climbing and jumping mechanics to solve, and the ability to *SPOILER* transform into a ball and use momentum to bounce and reach previously unreachable areas *SPOILER* which is fun in itself.  It's one of the games that looks simple and low-budget and to an extent it is, but it also has this deceptively deep story and an incredible atmosphere and soundtrack which to me at least is one of the hardest but most important elements of a game to get right.   To say go play this game and see for yourself isn't very helpful I know, but it really is something that you need to play to understand the points I'm making. If you're feeling hesitant, buy it on sale, but keep it on your wishlist because this is a game that you need to play.
1498	0	a	I had some high hopes for this game after playing the first one. I was expecting multiplayer like battlefield but instead It's co-op mission based multiplayer. Single player was under whelping, I stopped the campaign within 1 hour, I couldn't force myself to play anymore. I would pass on this game, definitely not worth $60. If you think this will be a fun game I'd wait for a price drop, at least 50% off.
1847	0	a	  Stay Away  Glad I decided not to preorder this game. I played during the free weekend and it's loaded with bugs and performance issues. Game will freeze for up to 2 1/2 minutes during firefights and regular loading time (like objective updates).  Graphics are great however overall they rushed this out the door due to hype just to cash in.
1653	1	a	  I like this game its smth like dying light wich is my favorite game so i think that why i enjoyed this game so much, at all a nice game but not worth the 40 bucks
1844	0	a	Yes, it is as bad as the reviews say.
1577	1	a	  I would give this a 7.5/10, the game has some glitches/bugs and you will notice some if you play the story for a decent amount of time, it has poor multiplayer but what it lacks in multiplayer it compensates in the singleplayer story. What i noticed was the lack of options for the graphics and mouse sensivity but you can adjust it at a mediocre level.  The gameplay is very imersive has lots of customization options i specially loved the stealth but everyone has it playstyle and i bet that all of them work, the only downside i noticed was the AI being a bit weird sometimes where the bots would stay still while getting shot. Graphics wise they are pretty good and they look even better with the day/night cicle where you can see beautiful sunsets and can also experience some night combat.  Let's go kill some KPA!   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=761389416

1755	0	a	  I have mixed feelings about this game, although it has been advertised as a great game in the Homefront franchise (I guess it's a franchise now) it actually isn't. It is a rather boring game at the beginning but it seems like that for the whole game especially because some of the objective markers can be extremely far away but one problem that I have with this game is how easy it is to kill some of the AI on one of the hardest difficulties, I am familliar with these type of games but I don't know how the game works out. I only put it on the hardest difficulty and when I engaged in combat it was very easy to eliminate them but for some reason they didn't hit too hard when they shot at you. That's my problem with the game but this can probably become obselete as I have played too many shooters that act like this, my main point is that this game is awfully easy and I don't recommend it.
2719	1	a	Deadly premonition derives from those loveable 60's B-movie tropes. While not great at a technical standard, Deadly Premonition has some of the most memorable moments in gaming history. A great story, an open sandbox world, interesting characters and a huge variety of other in game tasks to complete besides the main story.  One of the most interesting things about DP (not deep pen) is the atmosphere. Tasked with trying to bring a killer to justice, you and a motley crew of under staffed local law enforces team up to tackle the rain coat killer. A mysterious individual who is going around town killing innocent women. The setting in the game is just amazing. As I said before, it's not a great technical achievement, but it doesn't have to be. Gameplay over graphics is always a motto I have said and stuck by. Set in an idyllic town set in the mountains you generally feel alone and constantly fighting to find out where to take your mystery solving crew next.   One scene has you hiding from the rain coat kliller as he chops down the door with an axe. Do you run? Do you hide? It's frantic and engaging and people will love the humour in this game. It's a light touch that is needed at certain points throughout the game.  This game is an utter joy to play and you will easily get 40+ hours form it. 
3097	1	a	This game was pretty much my life at one point. There's so much to do and the world feels very alive. Great music and gameplay. A coozy game you can get really immersed in.
2453	1	a	Polarizing? Absolutely. Its a game with a 90 degree learning curve, antiquated systems, and a glacial game speed. Though, I find myself absolutely drawn to it. Before I bought the collectors edition on release date, I heard nothing but bad news about this game. Unplayable, they said. Arcane, it said... yet I still bit the bullet and bought it.  It isn't streamlined, minor tasks are difficult, and you will find yourself save scumming. It took me forever to get through the inital quest, but something kept me playing. I realized it was the story. An interesting world, fascinating systems, and a dark grim world that is a joy to explore. Add in detective elements as you play the titular inquisitor, and you have yourself something not quite polished, but unique and fascinating. If you can brave the lackluster gameplay, you'll find yourself drawn to the dark world surrounding it.  That being said, 10 dollars is a lot to ask, wait for a discount.

365	0	a	This is one of the worst games I have ever played. If you like context dependent 'find the magic pixel' games wearing the disguise of a puzzle/stealth game then this is perfect for you. WHO WAS THIS MADE FOR? Omen fans? Were people really clamoring for â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ controls and contrived plots? How about broken stealth segments that rely on repetition with little to no indication of where enemies are? I can not emphasise enough how terrible this game is.  You play Lucius, the antichrist born through the machinations of your grandfather who made a pact with the devil to gain power and money. Now you have to go through a mansion and kill people as offerings to Satan in an effort to increase your power. This is done by finding little items hidden throughout the one location in the game and using them to engineer traps or situations that you can influence through your satanic powers that end with someone dying. I guess it's a good game for... snuff enthusists? The payoff to solving the puzzles is a gruesome cutscene sometimes followed by a new power to use that are highly sensitive to context. There's no experimentation, no alternate paths, just a set puzzle with one often obscure conclusion. God help you if you don't know where to get an item that you need to solve a puzzle. It'll usually be tucked away, some colorless chunk on the washed-out palate that you need to click on. Speaking of items, there's an inventory where you store particular items that relate to the story but there's no differentiation between the items you can pick up and the junk that is strewn throughout the house that you can just pick up and HOLD. Sometimes you'll even need to just pick up the items you can't put in your inventory! The house, which is the only setting, is featureless and huge. You can run around up and down stairs, but if you turn a corner too fast or make some minute adjustment with the camera you're going to get lost. Every room and every hallway looks the same, but after about 4 hours of playing I stopped having to refer to the map every 10 seconds.  The characters are all terribly stiff archetypes capering around and delivering lines through terrible voice acting. Not many lines were recorded, so expect to hear repeated dialogue a LOT. Another part of the story is told through what seems to be the diary entries of a detective named 'McGuffin' (hilarious) but I have NO IDEA why these segments were included. Who cares about what some detective is doing when that isn't the focus of the game at all? Why make that a thing? There's no mystery being solved for the player. You know EXACTLY what's happening because the 10 minute intro sequence spelled everything out for you. No tension is built through this parallel exposition and no new information is gained. It just turns into a boring sequence of people jabbering at each other, faking emotion while delivering tired and predictable lines that usually pan out like this: 'I'm a detective who can't figure out why people keep killing themselves.' 'Something weird is going on and the my upcoming election can't handle the scandal if the public gets wind of all these people killing themselves in my home.' 'I know. It's so WEIRD though.' Now repeat that between every one of the 18 chapters. This game was boring, frustrating, contrived, cheap, brought nothing new to the experience, had shoddy controls, barely any mechanics, and was a genuine pain to play. Don't buy it, don't play it.
559	1	a	I'd give it a 7/10. It's about 7 hours of gameplay and plays like a horror Hitman. It's good fun, but def not worth $20. I'd say $10 is the right price.

321	1	a	If you enjoyed the movie The Omen you'll enjoy this game. It's a linear story game with objectives and side objectives to complete. The Side objectives are completely optional unless you wanna nab all those achievos. The collision with objects can be a little wonky (your telekenesis tends to make items flail at lightspeed which is bad when you need to move items to a specific area) and the collection of items required for missions is cryptic. My biggest complaint would be for one mission where you have to place an object in a VERY specific spot to trigger the event. I won't say which one specifically but I was running around the yard for like 15 minutes trying to find this damn spot. Other than that (and getting stuck in a coffee table) it's a pretty fun game!
1923	0	a	Pretty much a weak Far Cry copy.
483	1	a	this game.... wtf.  you play as a little boy that is the son of satan, el diablo, lucifer, wtfe you wanna call him. in this game you are in a huge mansion with many rooms to explore, you fine clever ways to kill the people living here, the maids, mechanic, buttlers, friends that visit, etc.  the way you kill each individual person is set, so if you kill them with a piano, that is the only way to kill them....so you cant switch it up.  you do need to sneak around and dont want to get caught while killing someone.  you need to collect items to finish you're murders.....like a screrw driver to unscrew/loosen things, or a lock to lock someone in a freezer, etc.  you also obtain special abilities/powers to help kill f****ers  you can also do good things, like chores around the house.  it is an interesting game, a different concept from abnything ive seen before and it is worth a try. though i doubt after beating it i'll play again, doesn't seem to be much replay value.   PROS: runs great no bugs or glitches ive seen kill people for no reason special abilities make you feel like anti-christ decent graphics nudity &gt;:) (cant have a satanic game without, just dont make sinse. jk) there are lots and lots of people in this mansion  CONS: the placement of all the residents and where they walk to and come back to seems to be set and doesnt change the replay value of this seems to be 0, once you beat it, there is nothing new gonna hapen next time through this game will upset jesus groupi... i mean good citizens that go to church &gt;:)   dont take offence to my review if you are a church goer, i'm only kidding.... or am i ;)   HELL yes i recommend! 7/10
2193	1	a	Its a diamond in the rough, if and I can't stress this enough 'if' the developers are commited to bug fixes and post launch optimization it will be able to claim a place as an 7.8/10 game. The game itself is good and you will enjoy the time spent while playing, it is just mared by either gameplay bugs or graphical artifacts that distract you from what is basically  'Skyrim with guns' in america  Pros: - Gun Custimization feels fluid and allows quick adaptation. - Graphics look good with well defined styles for each area - Well designed world layout - Multiplayer is a fun co-op experience if you have friends to play it with, think Mass Effect or Dragon Age Inquisition.  Cons: - Bugs aplenty - Voice acting is similar to most other Deep Silver games, decent but not great - Story is very short in terms of how much time you actually spend doing the missions - Unskippable Cutscenes

2042	1	a	Standalone + Voice of Freedom Reveiw  This by far is one of the best games I have played for a while and i enjoyed every second of it. First play through on this game i put 27hrs into it unlike most 6-8hr linear games out there.  This game delivers you in stunning graphics great combat open world story experiance with  Endless ways to approach your objective switching up your weapon style on the fly using  The primary guns frame and attaching other mods changing the gun style completely.   After a while it may seem repeataive but this game keeps it fresh with new areas missions feels like your fighting for something.  This game is a big improvement from the first game and it stands alone you can not compare it to other games.  This game deserves to be a Triple A tilte and a spot in your library and  I give it 9/10 with my seal of approval.  -The voice of freedom dlc reveiw, 9gb download with a 30 minute campaign really! 9 gb I would expect 8-9hrs this is the shortest dlc i have ever played. i love this game but not this dlc, It should of been heaps longer like getting recruits as you progress through the campaign leading upto the events of standard game (more story driven). But not this I don't understand this dlc i give it a 1/10 very dissapointed.

Running Homefront on its highest settings is going to be demanding but if youâve got a strong system then youâll appreciate the benefits of this game. CryTekâs CryEngine 3 is still one of the best game engines used. Frame rates are high and crashes are extremely rare. Homefront: The Revolution may not be a contender for game of the year but it is a formidable release and well worth the investment.

2649	1	a	Nominated for the 'Game within a game' Award.  (Review updated 11/23/2016) I first played this game many years ago on the Xbox 360. I then got it on steam from my better half.  I started to play it ( back in the day) because it looked silly.. AND at the time it got a review of 1/10 ( that has since been changed to a better score) but the game showed me it was much more than silly voice acting and odd characters.   This is a wonderful game with a deep story. VERY campy. Based around a show called Twin Peaks. Yes, there are some issues. Controller issues, things like that.. but playing the game is worth it even with the small issues.  This game is not for everyone! As i said it is very campy. Some might not understand this.( or it is not their type of humor) Try to give it a chance you might love it.   There is a mod out there to make the game easier to play ( more choices for screen size, better map and that) It is called DPfix 0.9.5 (  http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?p=438  ) be sure to get the newest one. I gave an older one by mistake and the map was so messed up.  Watch these videos to see! (I think it was the wrong one for 9 eps.. OOPS!! That was my fault. I am sorry.)

3112	1	a	My feelings on this one are a bit mixed, and in general I will give a recommendation to an indie game I have mixed feelings about.   There are a lot of ideas here, but I think the story-telling in particular didn't work out. The stories were so spread out and so jumbled over the many hours of play, it was difficult to necessarily remember characters from time to time as they came up. Even with the three protagonists, this was a problem, as I couldn't always recall what details were true of which one.   The second thing that didn't work out was the warp zones. The entries to them were so spread out, and the exits not marked on the map at all. So it always seemed better not to use them and walk straight to where I was going, rather than possibly walk the same distance and break a crystal.  What is great is the feeling that you are exploring a real space. This isn't an over map and castles, everywhere is connected to everywhere else, there are no barriers.  There are also some quite surprisingly beautiful set pieces, with music that wonderfully accompanies them.  And as in Knytt, the pitter patter of the running and jumping is very satisfying.  Finally, I have not idea why this game is M-rated. Because one of the characters is a lesbian? I find making a game M-rated simply because lesbians exist extremely offensive.

2252	1	a	TL;DR This is an OK game. You would think that mixing Crysis2 and Farcry3/4 would give you something stellar, but the game is held back by technical aspects. I am think that if the game gets some patch love this game would be worth 60 bucks. At launch though its worth 40 bucks IMO. 15 hours if joe blow plays, maybe 25 if you 100%. No NG+. Farcry3/4 with a 'face lift' and no fetch quests.  I have two 780's, this game doesn't run SLI. This seems to be par for the course however, SLI support has sucked for the past year. I have to run this game at low settings to get this to run at 60fps on my 2560x1080 monitor. This game runs like cold molasses, uphill, in january, on pluto. When I did have my settings jack way up the game did look fairly nice, but it seems like you need a 9xx or R9 3xx card in order to play it like that. There was also quite a bit of popin when I was playing, I'd like to say thats due to my low settings, but this being a console port leaves me wondering.  I have heard that there are a number of glitches, I encountered maybe 2 that required a 'restart from checkpoint' both were doors not opening. All the other glitches I saw were few and far inbetween, and also resulted in a chuckle. Nothing game breaking was encountered but buyer beware, others have had issues.   'Trigger warning: I played â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ easy mode' Gunplay is fairly diverse and enjoyable. There is a usable cover fire system, but it only allows fire from chest high walls, no corner shooting. I found myself switching between the whole selection of guns though my game. Though there are only 6 guns, they have 3 modes. Meaning you are always equiped for any situation. Some modes are worth more than others however, battle rifle outclasses the sniper, auto/pump shotties are better than blunderbuss, etc. I found myself using all of them at least once however. The upgrade system leaves something to be desired however. After beating the game I had only upgraded 6 of my 18 guns. This can be done if you play this game like a Just Cause achievement hunter, but joe blow will likely upgrade the 4 modes he likes the most and get the the end before other upgrades happen. Gun attachments feel like crysis, so theres that. Also, not taking guns from the baddies.  Stealth. Its in the game? Don't get seen, use suppressor(pistol only)/crossbow, get lucky and kill the guy shooting at you without tripping the alarm, hide like its asscreed. The game tries to come down like a ton of bricks if you are seen, but the generous hiding spots negate this quickly. Honestly if you want Stealth play the riddick games. This has servicable stealth.   I got into multiplayer once, it seems to be CO-OP only and my game musta had a 700 ping. Good concept though, lets hope there are players for lobbies, as you need 2 to start.  Over all, ignoring my having to play at low settings its a good game. 60 bucks? ehhhh, if you and a few buddies like to play online sure. Campaign is 30-40 bucks, none of the characters are noteworthy or memorable. The worst one does kill themself so thats a plus, even if it is in the name of freedom.

2734	1	a	On paper, this game has everything. It's a horror adventure game with an elaborate Twin Peaks-inspired story that takes roughly 20 hours to complete depending on how much time you spend doing sidequests. It's got an open world for you to explore, there's a bunch of ranged and melee weapons, puzzle sequences, hunger mechanic, you name it. The problem is that this game plays and looks like a Playstation 2 game. The graphics are outdated, which wouldn't be too bad if the design wasn't also outdated: it basically plays like a poor man's Silent Hill, and it is full of tedious missions and easy combat encounters.  This PC port is also a mess that is locked to 720p, lacks color filters that the console version apparently had and crashes regularly. You can fix all of this by installing three easy fixes that you can find on the forums, but still. If you want a game that works right out of the digital box and plays like a modern survival horror game, it's hard to recommend this.  Yet, I absolutely loved this game, and it is all thanks to the story and characters. You play as Francis York Morgan, an FBI agent who comes to the small town of Greenvale to solve the murder of a young woman. Sounds familiar? Yes, the game's story is basically a funnier Twin Peaks, and I loved it. It is at times super weird, super funny and super interesting, so it was easy for me to overlook all the shortcomings of the game. The dialogue, story beats and even the cheesy comic relief made this game so easy to enjoy. I just wish this 'Director's Cut' had more stuff to it than extra costumes and some cutscenes, and also made the game look and play a bit better.

552	1	a	What's more fun than being the Son of Satan?    Methodically killing everyone that lives in your household starting with the help and working to your family members without anyone suspecting a thing through a series of sometimes difficult puzzles? Absolutely!    Lucius was the first game that I ever purchased for Steam in 2012 and have continued to love the same since then and would highly recommend this classic to those who even just enjoy the gore-factor alone (let's get this straight- GORE from a 2012 game which shouldn't deter the squimish). I have honestly enjoyed playing through this game and watching as my actions create grief amongst the family, sending members into insanity, anxiety, and paranoia as you get away with murder upon murder through fifteen chapters.    My only issue with Lucius is the directional issue of the game itself, sometimes glitching and resulting in a level which is impassable which has happened a few times which I picked up items before the actual time that I needed them- or had no idea what I was doing in the level at all due to minimal direction. Other than that (and some slight issue with controller support) there are not many negatives to Lucius than sometimes rushed story/chapters and a semi-cheesy plot that parallels the Omen. Not to mention how uncanny Lucius' model is on top of the fact that he does not speak ( which is fine since the awesome voicework of the rest of the cast makes up for it compeltely with emotional delieveries of lies! ) and some slight animation lackage ( which I'll give leaniancy to since it is a 2012 game )   All and all, I would definately recommend this game to anyone who has had the hankering to be the murdering Son of Satan!   
3060	1	a	Knytt Underground is a sequel to an indie platform game that was making waves online. Now available on Steam, the game has you playing the role of a little girl who looks like some kind of evil doll. Look at her run, thatâs evil. Freaky little legs swinging around like sticks. But either way this little girl goes on a metroid style quest to explore temples and dungeons. While the game may look like a first graderâs attempt at drawing, the level design is pretty solid. The dialog is a bit strange, and for some reason the game got an M rating because somehow characters get into sexual conversations and curse a lot. Thereâs something a littleâ¦ special? about this game. If you can get past that, you will find some fun platforming and metroidvania style platforming. Plus now Iâm going to beat it just to find out what that M rating was for.  Watch the full review on  ShotGaming.com  Steam Shots EP124
2311	1	a	I waited a long time for this game, and i was very disappointed with it. However i would still recommend you make your own decision instead of reading someone else's self proclaimed review. I recommend this game but with caution in mind, remember you have only 2 hours to refund if you truly don't like it. If the price had been 39- 49.99 i would have probably kept it. 66.49 really? Developers are getting greedier even with digital downloads, as if they sent me a CD to justify the extra cost.

2412	1	a	I tried this game on a Free Weekend and decided to buy it. The graphics are awesome. You can carry two primary and a secondary weapon at a time, but all of those can be converted to two more on the fly (does SW Republic Commando ring any bells?). As of the current patch (v1.06 I believe), the game seems stable. The issues are all related to stealth: enemies are spawning too frequently and too close to the player, the detection/alert system needs a complete overhaul. Only the pistol and SMG can be equipped with a silencer in single player mode. To have a viable medium/long range silenced weapon, you have to fully upgrade the crossbow. Otherwise, the gameplay is fine, you have plenty of weapons, attachments and gadgets to fit your playstyle. It's an open world game divided into war zones and heavily policed regions. There is no PvP, only co-op missions on separate maps.

1733	0	a	I enjoyed the first homefront game quite a bit, although linear and feeling very outdated even upon release. I really wanted to try the second one. The reviews and outrage about the bugs, and constant glitches kept me away. After seeing the game on sale twice within two months I decided to give it a go for the heck of it.  I was very...disappointed. Even on max setting the game seemed to run ok, just up until you actually got to roam around. Within the first hour I ran across the same character models over...and over. People talking in the streets sunk into the ground up to their knees and popped back up, enemies would take one shot at me, then put away their weapon and walk away letting me just walk up to them and stab them. A sniper had a light on me for 6 minutes and never took a shot, allowing me to walk up to the second floor and stabing them without them even turning around. Your own people would suddenly veer off and get stuck on something or another, and run in place forever. So....in essence the AI is completely screwed up. For being an oocupied city, it was quite void of life. Two kpa walking around, though when you took an area suddenly 10 resistance people popped up, some stood still, some ran off to get stuck on objects. I kept sighing as the hour I played was painful.   I'm told there had been patches done and the game had been more stable, and many glicthes/bugs fixed. So I can't imagine what this game was like before that. Honestly, and dlc being released? The game is still a mess of bugs. I've seen early alpha games run smoother than this. 5 months after release, and it feels like a disaster. I'm not sure any free weekend, or sale will salvage this which is a shame. I love the concept, I love the idea of it all and was always a huge Red Dawn fan....old one not the newest one...  I really wanted to like this and intended on keeping it no matter what, hoping it would get better but after an hour of seeing people getting stuck on obstacles, enemies ignoring me as I walked up to them and shot them to pieces...I couldn't force myself to continue. What a mess....

Graphics : Starts to be kind of outdated but really far from unplayable, they're decent.  Storyline : The overall storyline was good, some of the puzzle in the games are very hard but they're logic at the same time, liked it.  Other/Mechanics : The mechanics of the game are simple to learn but sometime they might be frustrating at times.

2928	1	a	CAUTIOUS RECOMMENDATION: In its current state, I can't recommend DP to anyone but the old school PC gamers that don't mind getting their hands dirty with tweaks and fixes to keep it stable, let alone looking adequate. If you don't know what an .ini file is, stay away. Even then, a quality experience is far from assured.  Aside from the abundant technical problems, everything that could be called gameplay is clunky and monotonous. It's absent for most of the game, but the ending ramps it up a lot, which quickly feels like a chore to complete.  That said, the characters and story are worth the trouble for those with the requisite patience.

2574	1	a	Excellent story and characters, though not without its flaws. Most people think this game's main appeal is that it's 'so bad it's good,' but honestly it's the fact that its really easy to get emotionally invested in the weird cast of characters. That's not to say that hilariously bad elements are completely absent, but they're absolutely not the reason people like this game.
1689	1	a	I'm really enjoying the game. Tried it at free weekend and in just a few hours I decided to buy it. Runs very well with i7 4770+16GB+770 2 GB. One great atmosphere moment was in the first night time, I found a rebel radio and listening while watching the ruined city was the moment I know I have to buy the game. ps: I hope someday see my dreamed Terminator game with this engine/gameplay options. That can be great.
2106	1	a	Im 4 hours in and so far I like it. Ive done time on both single and multiplayer. There is a brutal occupation going on, and you get to go out into urban areas to blow people's heads off. The graphics are great, the bugs are just like every other game, and the controls and game mechanics are the same as far cry ... which is why I like this game so much. I loved blood dragon, and this is its meaner, grittier cousin. I give it 4 out of 5 stars. Higher to 4.5 if the modding community gets ahold of it for episodic multiplayer events. Sooner or later someone will mod some zombies, but maybe something new will be out there this time for these â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Norks.  *9 hrs in and the game keeps getting better. I can see why people that only invested 10 mins give horrible reviews. The first mission takes awhile, so it will soil the experience for some.
2660	1	a	Do you like weird games? Let me rephrase that. Do you like Resident Evil, Shenmue, Persona and Silent Hill? Do you want to play them at all once?  Deadly premonitions looks bad, controls bad and would overall be a bad game if it were not for the brilliant absudity it offers. Moments of tension and mystery are intersped between hilariously bad writing and super cheesy dilogue. Deadly Premonitions is the rare example of a horror-comedy in video games and is an absoloute must play for anyone. The PC port offers a better control scheme than the PS3 version, but it also comes with it's own limitations. Rising Star gave us one of the worst ports of all time. For some reason the game is locked into 720p and though it touts controller compatability it is entire incompatable with XInput controllers, meaning your 360 or logitech controllers will not work without third party programs. There are a coouple fixes from a clever modder to fix the display issues, but otherwise get the PS3 version instead.

2867	1	a	Zach, have you heard of the 2010 video game Deadly Premonition, directed by Hidetaka Suehiro? It's about an FBI agent investigating a mysterious murder in a seemingly peaceful small town. On the surface it looks to be based on the 1990 television show Twin Peaks, but it really takes the idea in a new direction. It's a very unique experience!  I vividly recall the wonderfully awkward voice acting and sound design over all else. The song 'Life is Beautiful' holds a particularly special place in my heart. Combined with the dated-yet-endearing graphics the game oozes an inimitable charm. Though Deadly Premonition mainly involves driving around Greenvale to investigate the murder and interrogate suspects, there are 3rd-person shooting sections where you fight paranormal monsters! Such scary fun! The controls were a little tough to work with at times, but nothing unmanageable.   Even though the game crashed on me several times I always came back to learn more about the strange residents of Greenvale and the bizarre story. Thankfully there are fans that love the game so much that they created their own patches to fix some of the problems! I highly recommend you look into them, Zach.  What's that Zach? Coffee? What a fantastic idea!

2481	1	a	You know, the game style is dated, similar to Diablo 2, but it's charming. The choices you make can carry great weight, depending on your playstyle. The game doesn't babysit you and stop you from going places where you might die quite easily either, which I appreciate. It shows the dev team has faith that we're not complete morons and we'll learn from our mistakes, rather than point us away every time. There's some typos in the text, but it really isn't anything game breaking or too distracting. Items can be a little tough to come by, but it makes it that much more awarding. 4 out of 5, really enjoyed it.

1796	0	a	I played and thoroughly enjoyed the original Homefront, so I was eagerly anticipating the release of Homefront: The Revolution. In total I've committed about 13 hours to it, and I have completed both the campaign and most of the strikepoints. The length of the game is far shorter than many have claimed, but it still is longer than average for most AAA titles. Whilst I enjoyed what I played, I can't recommend the game until the AI and optimisation are fixed, as these two are critical in holding it back.  A few things worth noting.  Graphics - Although it may be poorly optimised, the game is quite aesthetically pleasing. The environment has quite a lot of detail, and is fairly immersive for an open world game. AI - is broken and needs a full overhaul. The AI suffers from pathfinding issues, and is generally dumb in combat often charging in wrecklessly. Optimisation - Througout my playthrough I had my settings on Ultra (aside from AA) and was playing at a resolution of 2560x1440. Unfortunately the game lacks an SLi profile (attempting to use Nvidia Inspector to force it creates a broad array of graphical issues). Forgettable generic characters

1978	0	a	My computer system exceeds the recommended requirements (albeit not by much, but still) and the first thing I see when we transition to actual, proper gameplay is a clunky as all â¥â¥â¥â¥ framerate that literally gave me a headache. I couldn't finish the opening bit because of this.  Once this is patched and the game runs at over 15 FPS, I will amend my review to reflect it.
1424	1	a	Rating: 7/10  A very fun, addictive game. It seems that driving over thousands of zombies and watching them splatter with full blood and gore effects never gets old! This game offers you just that. The gameplay is the core of this game, as all you get to do is kill zombies (Thousands of them), save survivors and cause mayhem. It's fairly arcade-like, so it's fun for a few minutes at a time. The graphics are not that great, but the game makes you look over it with the amount of blood and gore it throws at you on the screen. It pretty much is a top-down version of Carmageddon, so if you have played the old classic, you're gonna love this. For owners of the old Zombie Driver, this game is some what of a rip off as it doesn't offer you much in comparison - But at a nice discount it's well worth it.

1177	0	a	A short way in and already frustrated. I can't stand it anymore. It's not like it has no shred of entertainment value, but I find it far from a fun game.   It's linear, so you have no choices in how it goes - I had hoped for a little more creative space, but that's my faulty expectation I guess. It's more like a chore-like puzzle than anything else. At one point you need to gather laundry... somehow you can only do this one â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ sock at a time. It's a minor thing, but the annoyance builds. And why the hell do I need to do that with 2 housekeepers in the house? WTF.  It's buggy... I had a bug right at the cinematic after the tutorial. Lip sync is off, clipping in animations. At one point you need to avoid your mother, but her pathing is so utterly â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ that she gets stuck on the staircase, or in an open doorway, fails to open a door and just keep walking at and away from it.... and half the time the game just games over right there. I just can't get past after 8 tries. It's bloody annoying, because it's not the challenge but the game that keeps me from progressing. At other point you just know that you need to use a specific item, but you move on because your cursor doesn't trigger a use function... only to find out wih google you needed to target a specific micro part that takes a while to get your cursor on right. Come on...  After a bit I just lost interest. Oh, another person needs to die. Okay. It's a nice theme, but the gaming element is just weak. I will try to finish it, but it just feels like driving with the handbrake on and a steering wheel that will only turn left.  EDIT after a few more hours: On the last few missions, my save file is corrupt and I can't play it. It just crashes when I load it and I really can't be bothered to start the earlier mission again. The entire experience was meh, no replayability, the steam achievements are not challenging because you get them after each scripted kill. I spent near to no money on it, so no harm done there, but damn don't bother with this.
1579	1	a	It's a lot better than what people say, I can only imagine what the bugs must have been like because it's genuinely a fun game. Is it the best thing ever? No, but from the bit I played of it you could do way worse.

480	1	a	A very interesting and enjoyable game, especially when you are the villain. Lucius basically plays like a 3rd person adventure game, where you take items and use them to complete tasks like killing people or doing chores, but mostly killing people.(This game is very graphic in some of the killings.) You're playground is the entire house, that unlocks completely after the third murder, but you can only kill a specific individual at a time. The tools can be collected at any time during the game even if you don't need them for that murder. As a reward for you're sacrifices you get paranormal powers that will help you kill more people. Powers like Telekinesis which isn't quite precise, mind control which is only used after everything else was prepared for the murder, mind wipe in case you get caught and a fireball for the boss battles which ware not enjoyable.  For the things this game gets right one thing one thing will annoy you a lot, that is the speed of the game. The tutorial is extremely fast, but after that it takes ages to figure out what to do, sometimes it's obvious, sometimes you get so stressed you look at a walkthrough just to get past that part (and whenever I need help outside what the game provides, it ruins the experience). Also the fact that the game does not have any checkpoints or save system outside the start of each chapter, if you make a mistake you go back to the start of that chapter. Another thing that I think the game could do without are the stealth levels and to some degree the boss battles.  A rather unique game, it mostly reminds me of the first Black Mirror game, a horror adventure game that was also slow, that had difficult puzzles and that also had a plot about the devil needing sacrifices for power. If you like adventure games and are looking for a horror story where you get to do the killing, this is the game for you, just be patient on the ride.

565	1	a	Really good game, puts you in the view of the killer as you have to try and kill people using creative situations. You have powers such as mind control, and telekenis, only thing bad was it was a very short game, beat it in about 8 hours. Would i recommend this game? I would DEFIENTLY recommend this game.
899	1	a	If, and only if, you're sick and twisted, like i am, will you enjoy this game... The blood and gore in Lucius is brutal. Even for a gore fan like myself, I even cringed during a few death scenes, and it's so much more brutal because you play a 7 year old child. Lucius, is one of a kind, a child possessed by the devil himself. You then go on a journey of pure carnage, killing the entire household, in many twisted ways. Great game, sometimes it can be frustrating finding the answers to the clues, but its worth it to see the murderous scenes that unfold... The gameplay is nice, runs and looks great, not too long, but not too short either, and the achievements flow in as the game goes on. Noticed today that the game went on sale, with a 95% discount, which is insanely good value for the quality of the game you get. I'm looking forward to completing my remaining achievements, and heading on to Lucius 2. 8/10
2570	1	a	Man, I wish that I could simultaneously 'Thumbs up'  and  'Thumbs down' this game. As it is I can't recommend this game but I can't recommend it  enough  either.  The game is  badly  developed on the PC. It basically won't run without using  Durante's dpfix  [blog.metaclassofnil.com]  and even then, with the latest version of that, it has issues like HDR style bloom occasionally flickering and blowing out the screen, an aimbox that doesn't let you aim outside of a  tiny  fraction of the screen, a screeching sound loop when you're in a car and crashes ever 25 minutes on the dot. Still, it's a really,  really  great story with really solid gameplay. On the one hand, if you have a 360 or PS3 then just pick it up used for one of those systems but, as of the time of this writing, it's on sale on Steam for $2.99 with the soundtrack and the OST  alone  is worth that money (listening to it right now). The game's not unplayably broken (with dpfix and compatibility mode for XP SP3/98 set) but it does have enough issues to make it a conditional recommendation even on sale.  Gameplay wise it's an open-world game set in a small town that feels realish. There are two major 'centers' to the town (downtown and a smaller business/residential area) and a bunch of places off in various parts of the countryside all connected with roads that feel planned rather than designed for sandboxing/gameplay. In many ways Greenvale feels more like a town than any other open-world location that I've played because of that.   A day-night cycle is present, as you'd expect, but unlike most open-world games it's not just a perfunctory addition that has no gameplay impact. Rather, NPCs have a routine and are available at certain places at certain times and not at all at others. This impacts when you can start sidequests and when missions can be taken. On top of that NPCs actually drive around Greenvale to get to their various locations. The first time I saw this in action I was standing outside a particular main character's house waiting to be able to start a side mission and I saw her drive up, get out of her car, walk into the house via the garage door (and then the mission still wasn't available so I 'peeked' inside the window and she was in there puttering around).  The story is one of the best told murder mysteries that I've played through. It's got elements of cosmic horror as well as 'good' old-fashioned depravity. As you progress through the missions you're going to be picking up clues that allow you to 'Profile' what occurred (basically a cutscene that starts out unclear but clears up as you gather clues) that will eventually lead you to the killer and uncover what the craziness that goes on in the dark, dark hours of the night is all about.   The shooty gameplay isn't particularly good but, thankfully, it's also not particularly necessary. A standard wrench (that you can get with infinite durability from an early sidequest) will do you well for most of the enemies through most of the game. Shooty wise it harkens back to the Resident Evil style aim and stand mechanics but you'll only hit an enemy if your sight actually crosses them and turns into a reticle. It's not great but it gets the job done and, aside from the three bosses in the late game, it's not really required. Just make sure you do the quests to get a .34 with unlimited ammo before you get to them.  All in all the game is flawed, critically so on the PC, but it's still such a satisfying game with an  excellent  story and a soundtrack that is silly, cheerful, haunting, beautiful and sad all at the same time. Definitely give it a shot in some fashion. Whether that be on one of the last-gen consoles, a PC with dealing with the issues that crop up or even  a no commentary 'Let's Play'

567	1	a	Lucius brings back the fun I remember from playing early sandbox games. The 'Story' portion of the game which takes you from start to finish is very linear. But I found a lot of times I was content to use the house as a playground for Lucius's powers instead of always immediately targeting my next victim. The game also somewhat obviously boasts quite a violent streak, almost to the point of it suffering from how extreme they are compared to the subtly in the story from the detectives perspective, and how the characters seem to nonchalantly react after 4 or 5 gruesome deaths. The game also feels a little short, even with mucking about this game is not in it for the long haul at all and with the linear story having almost no replayability that is a bit of a down-note for Lucius. Bottom Line: definitely worth getting, if it's on sale.

2938	1	a	OK, this game surely has its problem. It's a bad port, it needs some twisting around from keeping it from crashing, the driving mechanics are objectively bad, and the graphics is surely not top notch. But this game is a breath of fresh air from all the 'this game mechanics work, let's copy-paste it' games, it's extremely original and has a great late 90's early 2000 japanese vibe. It has one of the best horror plot ever seen in video game history, the character development is incredible and i was surely not expecting anything even close to this level. The english production is great, the voice acting is magnificent. The game is an open world investigation horror with paranormal elements, and it's unique in its genre. It's surely a game to try out, sadly the first 15 minutes of tutorial are not representative of the rest of the game and can turn a lot of people off before they get to the real beginning of the game. I really feel like recomending this to anyone who wants to try something different from the gaming standards we are accustomed today

1252	1	a	Apogees Duke Nukem Death Rally meets Rockstars Classic Grand Theft Auto. Top down car driving gun blazing zombie killing goodness.  Played the original a what seem like 6 ish years ago ?, and to be honest didn't give it much thought, it was ok but found it fiddly with a keyboard and mouse. Skip forward to 2015 and I picked up the ZD HD complete pack for just over Â£2 and have been playing it nearly 5 days now, this time however with an xbox controller.  In short the game visualy looks very nice, easily some of the best 'indie' game graphics available even against 2014/15 offerings. SFX compliment the game well nice solid sounding guns and squishy zombie splatter under the tires. Heavy Metal BGM during the survival mini games gets your adrenalin pumping but is less suited perhaps to the missions of the main game, it is good but can become repetative. Voice acting ... well at least there is some, lets just say it doesnt add nor detract from the game, and I've defo heard a lot lot worse.   Game can be tricky to control with kyb and mouse and is definatly easier to be prescise with a stick controller like xbox/ps3 controller.  Main game offers 31 missions each taking between 3-10 mins to complete on your first play through, each with highscore tables and secondary optional missions offering limited replay value but atleast it has. These can be replayed in any order, using any car you have unlocked with ay upgrades you have unlocked making a replay easier to obtain a better score or to do secondary missions.  Survival mode offers erm.... 7 ish arena maps with the aim to survive as long as possible with waves or increasing numbers and toughness of mobs, earning upgrades each wave to assist you and random weapon and bonus score drops. each map having its own high score tables. This is easily the most fun mode and will keep you playing for significant time after having completed the main game. To be fair some of these maps can feel a little small or tight to move around and can feel like you are just driving in a circle, but most are nice arenas with multiple paths to manouvre around.  Race mode, this is somewhat similar to a classic game Death Rally from the 90s, I havent played much of this so far but is a series of tournaments made up of a set number of events, such as race, checkpoint and elimination. This can be a little frustrating as it is very easy to get stitched up right at the end of an event after leading 95% of a race. This mode seems to be 75% player skill and 25% luck.  Money spent on car and weapon upgrades from the main game are for the main game only, in the main game new cars are unlocked through playthrough. In survival upgrades are earned in each game for that game only by completing waves cars are unlocked in this mode by unlocking them in the main game. In race mode cars have to be unlocked with money, money earned and spent on cars and upgrades in race mode is for race mode only.   I can not comment of the race mode achievements, however achievements for the main game are not difficult to obtain. There is one that you should be aware of before starting your first playthrough which if missed will require a full 2nd replay.... which is probably best as it will be easier with some experience having played the game, and one that will require a little skill and luck and several play throughs requiring to complete last mission with less than 10% health. The survial achievements are easily obtainable and fun to boot. With my limited time spent of race mode, I do not think they will be too hard just frustrating needing several replays that will take time, depending on skill or rather luck.  Perhaps the best thing about ZD HD is whether you have 5 mins to play a game or 4 hours, it will keep you entertained and survival mode will always suck you in for just one more try.  If your paying full price just pickup the main game and the Apocalypse pack well worth the money. If its on sale then buy the complete edition, either way this game is easily a must buy for your collection.   ***EDIT***  Just a quick note, system specs are i7 4500HQ, 16gb, R9 265x and game runs fine at max settings 1080p, a little slowdown ( just dips below 30fps ) at points in a couple of the later missions, no slow down on survival or race modes. Accidently run with onboard 4600HD for the first couple of missions and would be fair to say it handled max settings well around 28-38 fps but would be fair to say later missions would pose a problem given the 265x diped below 30 at times, should be ok on HD or HD+ however with 4600HD.
588	0	a	I first played Lucius with high expectations but it only took me less than a hour that despite the great concept and promisse of this game, it failed deeply to deliver. For those of you who don't know, basicly the premisse of Lucius is that you're the son of Satan and he speaks to you at certain times teaching you new powers/spells and when you find a certain person on your house he'll tell you that you need to kill her. I understand that some games are better done if they restrict the player options ,in order to experience a story for example, but in this case I feel like the death of each one of those individuals being scripted didn't actually helped that much. Sure the developers created on their own way for each person to get killed in order to unfold the story which takes place around you and the detective which is investigating the deaths on your house along with your family but I feel like if they allowed to each player kill those people using their 'imagination', per say, and their powers it would be actually alot more fun, don't get me wrong I actually thought some of them were well made. I also felt like the game was poorly optimized because I believe the cutscenes are rendered ingame and they ran pretty poorly for me for some reason but that's maybe just something on my end. One thing I really hated was that sometimes if you wake up and you need to get a certain item in order to kill someone, if you miss your 'window of oportunity', like someone goes over to that room and they can't see and you need to wait for him to go to sleep it's actually pretty boring, atleast for me anyways. Overall I can't put myself to playing Lucius until the end because I just can't take it, the concept is great but it's poorly executed as far as I see it or maybe I just don't like the game at all. Eitherways, I don't recommend this one, beware.
385	1	a	An amazing concept, a unique idea, greatly executed.  Despite some minor bugs and some aspects that may be updated (such as some collision bugs), Lucius properly mixes and blends together various genre in one product: stealth, point and click, puzzle, crafting, open world in one game.  You play as the six year old Lucius, a kid who literally works for the Devil as his personal cook as your task will be to bring him souls to feed him. In the vast Dante Manor there are many individuals to choose from while keeping the good-boy attitude not to raise suspects. While murdering members of your family and their servants, you will be asked to perform chores like brushing your teeth, tidy up your room, finding objects etc. These chores will slowly award you special objects.  As you kill people, you will strengthen your evil skills and gain new ones.  I will not spoil much of the game itsel as it's a continuous surprise.  My advice is to purchase this genre-defining game!

1229	1	a	[NOTE: All of my reviews are based off of value for money/comaparison to price. I purchased 'Zombie Driver HD' for 69p with a 90% off voucher.]  To start. This is one of those fun little games that you would play when you don't have enough time to play a missoin on a bigger game but want to play something. (Damn those poorly timed meetings.)  Story: A zombie acopalypse strikes. You are a taxi driver in a large city who is saved by the army. However, the army is limited and you are needed to assist in rescue efforts and clearing zombies out of certain areas. You car can be outfitted with various weapons and armour types. You can unlock new vehicles by completing secondary mission objectives.   Gameplay:  There are powerups/healthkits/weapons that you can collect around the map in a mission to make it a bit easier. You can Run over, Burn, Shoot and Blow up as many zombis as you can. There are also minigames such as races and wave survival. It is fun to play for those timess you are bored and want to play a full campaign.
1008	0	a	I didn't find the game to be that interesting or intuitive. There's no motivation from the main character to bring about the horrific deaths of other people in the house except 'Satan appeared in my room one night and told me that if I murder people I get more psychic, I am totally okay with this.' Like, okay, sure. I'll fumble around with no hints and kill people I have no/minor grudges against, sounds great.

2965	1	a	Bad PC port. Be prepared to waste an hour figuring out how to install fixes to get it to work at all. Almost unplayable in its normal state.   Once I got it running it had a really trippy japanese horror movie thing going on, but I didn't get very far cause I think it crashed.   
690	1	a	Soothing music and backdrop 11/10 Recommended for casual gamers
2693	1	a	I honestly had my feelings about this game constantly change the moment I heard about it. I originally ignored it thinking it wasn't for me, then thinking it wasn't that great. Once the PC version was announced my interest in the game was sparked again, and I looked into it. Eventually got it as a gift on steam cause it was cheap and me and my cousin get each other games for our birthdays, and I am so glad I played it. Now, the thing about this game is the gameplay is not the best part. In fact it's a little weak, fun, but not too strong. It's obvious that they were indeed forced to include the RE4 style combat by the publisher, and I bet the game would've been better if more focus on the breath holding mechanic was your main way of dealing with enemies. Another thing some people might consider weak is the voice acting, and while it is 'bad', a lot of people have such a charm to them that I actually like the voice acting. The games music is also wonderful, especially the classic whistle tune you hear throughout most of the game. The graphics while looking dated, don't look dated in a bad way to me. They give a cozy feeling.  Now outside of things like music, graphics and gameplay, the PC version does have some notable issues. One is the lack of graphics and resolution options, which doesn't bother me but just cause I don't care doesn't mean it isn't an issue. The game also tends to crash, and for a while I had no way of continuing without using another save file ahead of me to avoid a crash, which fixed itself for me but not everyone. I'm not aware of any other issues, but if you find yourself discovering more issues before purchasing the game then look into getting the original release of the game on the Xbox 360, because while it has it's own issues the Director's Cut doesn't have, there are more game crashing, lag and other issues present in the Director's Cut versions of Deadly Premonition than there is in the original version.  In the end, besides that one crash I got which fixed itself I would highly recommend this game, on any platform, just that if you have any issues or don't want to take a chance get the 360 version of the game. If you need strictly good gameplay, which is what I usually need to enjoy a game, then you might want to pass on this game. I normally prefer the gameplay of my game be good, rather than my story or anything else (but music or story being better than gameplay so long as the gameplay is still really really solid works for me as well) but Deadly Premonition is just a case where even with gameplay that's only maybe a 5/10, the rest meshes so well together in a way that I just enjoy spending my time playing this game. I would probably say this is one of my top favorite games of the previous generation. Please do yourself a favor and give this game a try or play it.
1980	1	a	From what i've played of the game so far it seems to be pretty decent, It's not gonna win any game of the year awards, but the world is gorgeous and very atmospheric. The gunplay is borderline exceptional IMO. There are a few glitches,but nothing ground breaking. I'm playing on the hardest difficulty and it seems this is how the game was meant to be played. It's not SUPER hard,but instead makes the AI pretty competent for the most part. The story is what you should be buying the game for. If youre a fan of single player story campaigns give this game a shot. I would probably give it like...UMMM 6.7/10 something like that. its worth buying,but once you finish the story your unlikely to play the game again.
2312	0	a	This game is a jerky ugly mess. FOV max of 65 gives me a headache, I cant get it to run with any kind of smoothness, even with everything dropped to Low. The controls feel floaty like mouse smoothing is on but I can't find a setting for that.  Complete buyers remorse inside 30 minutes, I'm impressed.

I also appreciated playing the roll of the bad guy for once, &amp; to have all the answers that everyone else is trying to figure out.  The story is engaging, albeit pretty cheesy &amp; predictable, but I got more of a feeling of old-flim nostalgia than annoyed at it. I'd give the story overall a 8/10.  The controls were pretty good on a XBox 360 controller, &amp; I was able to run the game passably on a toaster of a laptop.

1556	1	a	It took a while for patching to make the game playable, but after 1.7 it went from unplayable to very playable. It's not a perfect game by any stretch, but I highly recommend it.   Note that i am a fan of the core Far Cry series, FC 2,3,4 as well as Arma. Those are the kinds of games I like to play.  Here's why Homefront The Revolution is a good game, for me... and maybe you...  1. They nailed philly and post invasion occupation. If you ever wanted to star in your own 'Reds' movie, this is it.   2. The whole premise, which starts with the Military in the US being disabled via hacking, is within the realm of possibility, say 30 years down the road.  3. The technological advanced machines the Koreans have in the game, if you project say 20-30 years ahead, are entirely plausable.  4. The enjoyment of this game, the immersion of it, went way up when I shut the Mini-map off. Recommend you do the same. It's all in settings and is easy to do.  5. The sound in the game is pretty good, sounds of occupation. It grows as the population is stirred up. Really adds to the immersion. I like to shut off the music unless I am really feeling 'cinematic'. But normally, I like the music off which adds immersion IMHO.  6. I have not finished the game but I am several hours into it. DON'T JUDGE THE GAME BY THE FIRST YELLOW AND RED ZONE you work. The game gets increasingly more exciting after a while. You will feel like you are a fugitive from justice.  7. There are a ton of side missions to do along the way, or stick with the main thread. I started my playing with medium difficulty and hud on, focusing on the main mission 'cause I was getting my butt kicked. Then I stopped the game, and began a new one, this time on hardest, no mini map (love it off!), and pursue all teh side missions.    And so this is why I enjoy playing this game.  There are some things I wish were better however: a. You can upgrade your guns, bombs etc... but the way you obtain them is by accumulating cash (or something called 'KPA points').   The whole thing about using cash for weapon upgrades just strikes me as totally non-immersive. Look, you're in a rag-tag group of resistance fighters, where you and your copatriots live in poverty... and you will become a big deal in teh resistence.,.. but you need money for weapons? I'd rather they use something like the 'renown' system found in silent hunter... if ya know what that is... they do use something called KPA points, but they can onl;y be used on certain items and not your main weapons.  This is not a fatal flaw, but one that just strikes me as silly each time I purchase an upgrade....  b. As a fan of the far cry series FC 2,3,4, the protagonist speaks a few words here and there in those games. Not a lot, but enough to feel like your character is a human. In Home Front, you are always silent, even when you woudl expect something to be said (I won't spoil it for you....).  This is not a major flaw as most of the time you are doing what freedom fighters do so well... and I suspect it was about budget, why we don't have that in the game. But just a little character talking on even rare occasions would have made the story more real.  Some have been critical of the story.. and it doesn't quite equal what you get in Far Cry ... still it plays a part in the journey and glues together the pieces in to a whole. I give the story a B.   ====================  Conclusion - as I said earlier - if you want to be in your own Reds movie (the original, not the sucky newer one...), and want to experience the feeling of taking back your community and your nation from an occupying force, I highly recommend this game for you.

2572	1	a	Deadly Premonition is one of the most unusual and strangest games I've played for a long time. That is true, not only because of its progressively more mystic story and the many weird citizens of Greenvale but also because of the peculiar mix of gameplay and technical elements. Many parts of the game are great, others are so bad they're good again, some are truely (ragequit inducingly) bad. Deadly Premonition is a very rough gem; it's seriously flawed but the game has real character. While I had a lot of fun with the game, playing it was quite frustrating sometimes. After the ending credits rolled I was left unsure whether I should be sad it ended, or glad that I won't have to experience any more of it. All in all the positives outweigh the negatives for me but I only recommend the game to people with patience in combination with high tolerance for bugs and broken gameplay.  For a little bit more detailed impression of some aspects I start with the technical side as this is where the most frustrating flaws of the game lie: The PC version of Deadly Premonition is a terrible console port. From what I read on various websites the game was already quite buggy on consoles; on PC most if not all of these bugs are still there but others were introduced on top of that as well.  For starters I experienced a half a minute up to 5 minutes long blackscreen before any cutscene would play. Because an intro cutscene would play before the start screen everytime the game starts and another one - summarising what had happened in the game before - everytime a game is loaded, this issue already made just starting the game an annoyance. Now add periodic crashes into the mix and the annoyance level is upped to eleven. The game crashed about two dozen times in the course of the game, mostly in the worst situations possible ('Oh, you just beat a sidequest in which you have to refight stronger versions of all bosses in a row without being able to save inbetween and you're just two steps away from a savepoint? Why don't you do it again? TROLOLOLO!'). Deadly Premonitions allows you to replay already finished chapters in order to pick up missed collectables or do sidequests, however during such replays saving is disabled until the chapter is finished, making crashes even worse than in the regular playthrough where often enough a savepoint is closeby.  Usually the crashes appeared somewhat randomly but then the game crashed everytime on the transition from chapter 8 to 9. Setting the compability mode to Windows 98 eventually got me through that part, though.  Additionally to long loading times and crashes there are some bugs with quests: After replaying earlier chapters quest items (especially temporary ones like keys for locked doors) are sometimes deleted from the inventory and can not be retrieved in normal ways. This happened to me once with an item needed for a side quest before I could finish said quest; in the end I had to change my savefile with an hex editor to get it back. Before playing I got the recommendation to play the game with a gamepad because, like many console games, it's supposed to play better that way. Turns out my gamepad (an old BigBen pad) isn't supported and because of the way gamepad integration is done in this port programs like x360ce or xpadder don't work with it rendering it impossible to use my gamepad. Still I found that keyboard + mouse controls worked well enough most of the time, only the handling of additional cars that can be bought later in the game is horrible.  Gameplay: Deadly Premonition's gameplay comes pretty close to what I wished Alan Wake, another game inspired by Twin Peaks, would be like: Almost at any time the player can choose to ignore the mainquest for a while and freely roam around the town of Greenvale, learning more about its citizen by questioning people, starting sidequests and searching for collectables.  At some points the game throws a puzzle at the player. The puzzles are few and they're really easy but it's still more than Alan Wake had to offer, which was mostly composed of cutscenes and filler combat. Speaking of which, a flaw Deadly Premonition shares with AW is boring, repetitive and clunky combat. Reducing the amount of combat or even removing it completely would have been an improvement in my opinion. In order to make up for less/no combat I would have loved to see the 'Profiling' feature expanded. Profiling, for me, is the #1 area where the game left a lot of unused potential. From the role profiling plays in the story one could assume it's a core part of the game but in the end it's pretty dull: At a crime scene the player sees a couple of noisy pictures showing the circumstances of the crime recreated by Agent Francis York Morgan, the game's protagonist, and now has to search for clues. Each found clue makes some of the pictures now appear clearly visible. And that's all. Turning these profiling sessions into puzzles, maybe even letting the players make their own deductions, leading to a branched-out (to some degree at least) storyline, would have vastly improved the whole game and further increased the incentive to replay finished chapters. So I didn't really like combat and the lackluster profiling that much but still both is 'okay' and far from gamebreaking. The one thing I hated about the gameplay are Quick Time Events. I hate QTEs in general but Deadly Premonition has some of the worst QTEs I've ever seen. An especially annoying QTE in the game makes you press buttons, apparently randomly chosen from four possibilities, in rather short time; be too slow or press a wrong button first and it's instant 'gameover, try again!' (including going through several black screens). Fortunately QTEs aren't that abundant but they were closer to making me quit the game for good than any of the technical issues. Deadly Premonition plays a bit like a Japanes horror shooter (think Resident Evil or Silent Hill) combined with an adventure game and a little bit of open-world.  Story/characters/music: The thing I enjoyed the most about the game are the wonderfully eccentric characters. It's full of well written, funny dialogues that are made even funnier by the often completely inappropriate background music. Or rather 'foreground' music, sometimes and seemingly random the music gets louder than the speech (like in a couple of other cases, the overall oddness of the game makes me unsure whether this is a bug or if it was than on purpose). Deadly Premonition can be very surreal sometimes. Still there are many scenes with a more serious tone (it's all about a murder case after all) and those work very well, too. Setting, characters and story are heavily inspired by the TV series Twin Peaks, therefore the aforementioned absurd dialogues are not surprising. Twin Peaks is among my favourite TV shows, so I highly enjoyed Deadly Premonition's setting. However from time to time the game draws a bit too heavily from its inspiration: some details about characters' backstories that get revealed through side quests are no big surprise if you've seen Twin Peaks. The main story line is, several parallels aside, mostly original, though. For the most parts it's well written and interesting but, especially towards the end, it gets cheesy and loses some of its charme. Biggest problem I had with the story was that, without need, the game gives an extremely obvious clue regarding the solution of the case very early on and no character, not even the alleged super-profiler Agent York, considers it during the investigation. Of course, from a meta perspective the game can't just end before it even really started but why bring a thing like that up at all then? Again I can't rule out that it wasn't done on purpose, though; maybe in order to lampshade B-movies from the 80s which are a recurring theme throughout the game and plotholes like that are not exactly a rare occurence in those movies.  Tl;dr in comment section
1629	0	a	Now with extra bugs... a short one-hour DLC broke the multiplayer, hope it will be patched soon...  Only recommended for fans of open world shooters if on sale at &gt;50% off.   The bad: - Rushed release with all the bugs you'd expect: Poor detection, crashes, getting stuck in the interface in-game, regularly falling through the floor, failing to trigger melee takedowns and being gunned down as a result... I could go on and on and on. - Campaign with a generic story that packs very few emotional punches. - Rushed multiplayer and really lackluster matchmacking... probably the reason why so few people are available for matches.   The good: - Brutal start to the campaign, very atmospheric and dark, has that oppressed vibe like City 17. - The apocalyptic warzones / red zones are the highlight of the game and feature some fantastic level design (especially for the multiplayer missions). - Decent shooting mechanics and creative weapon animations.

1806	0	a	  A stale, unfinished game. Honestly, I love the concept of playing as part of a guerrilla resistance, but this game follows the boring trends of all the other open world first person shooters. Clear out this base, it is now your base, get rewards, repeat. This repetitiveness on top of a generic story that tries too hard to make you care for a character two seconds before they die for dramatic emphasis and endless clipping, pop in, and other technical issues makes me not want to play this even for free.

1903	1	a	Played the game from start to finish on Deathwish difficulty during the free weekend. I'm glad I waited, because it's fantastic.  I know the game was off to a troubled start, and so I waited until the invetible free wekend after the latest (as of Sep 11, 2016) patch to try the game out.  Finally, after all these patches, the game is now complete. And it's pretty good.  The combat is rock solid - I love the feel of the weapons. Some of them aren't really viable, but they're fun to play around with anyways. The story seems to jump around a lot towards the end, but it was overall coherent and emotional. Not Oscar-level, but good enough to keep me interested.  You really do get the feeling of a desperate, scrappy urban combat. The difficulty ramps up nicely and I always felt challenged. Being able to recruit up to 4 resistance members to chum around with takes the game from good to great - the game is nearly impossible on the hardest difficulty without support and knowing when to just run.  Overall, I would say this game is as good as Far Cry 3 - maybe even better, since I prefer the urban combat.

Actually this is game where little kid Lucius, one sadistic little manipulative being is loved :3 (illuminati xD)  This is a fun dark game, thats build on evil.  When stuck in tasks, you have to think. That's also great thing, cuz u are helping ur brain. In this game, you also learn a lot of things.  The voice acting is not that good, so i think it's about 8/10. Voice acting and lipsync often failes. With fun, this is also one 'MORBID' game.  Most of the time, you have no idea what to do 'cuz there is no hints where to go. Huuuge house sometimes becomes boring, when u have to wander around it over and over. Can't kill how u wants. Anyways, i recommend this game from heart, everyone should play it !

2721	1	a	How do I describe this game in one sentence? 'It's so bad it's good.'  Deadly Premonition is a game I have only played for five hours, but am completely in love with. And by all rights, I shouldn't be. The graphics are PS2-era, the combat is mostly a Resident Evil 4-esque 'stand still and aim with a relatively poor laser sight' system against enemies, the voice acting is often laughable, the music is repetitive (I'm pretty sure there are only about five or so tracks) and often plays at the most random and unfitting of moments... It's a recipe for an absolutely terrible game.  In fact, I quit during the first half an hour, regretting my buy. But something... Strange.. Urged me to go back to it. Perhaps it was my desire for a survival horror game that I've never played before, or just that I was bored out of my skull and decided to give it another chance, I don't know... But I'm so glad I did.  The first 20 or so minutes is a really bland, boring, linear shooting section with minamilistic horror at best, but once I got past that, the game, and indeed the world, opened up.   That was my first surprise: the game is open world. It's quite large, too, filled with interesting characters, side-quests and locations to visit. And facial animations, oh lord, those facial animations. The main character sometimes smiles a smile so horrifyingly terrible that I'm almost convinced it's actually a genius ploy by the developers to show how Detective York might actually have some sort of severe autism and is incapable of natural emotion. He sure seems like it, sometimes.  Detective York is the strongest point of the game. An antisocial FBI lone-wolf detective/criminal profiler. York's character ranges from amusing, to awkward, to being an absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥. He's completely foreign to socializing in the 'normal' way and doesn't care to hurt feelings if it furthers his case. He also has a (perhaps unhealthy) interest in the murders of young women, knows everything there is to know about terrible 80's movies and... Oh yeah, did I mention he also talks to himself? The mysterious Zach (who I'm certain is actually supposed to represent the player, but there might be a big twist that I don't yet know about) seems to be some kind of imaginary friend, or split personality, that York often converses with, though you never hear Zach converse back.   York is also an absolute genius, as proven at multiple points throughout the game. He solves riddles, rolls his eyes at stupidity and sees those miniscule details that solves cases that no-one else seems to see. He's also good at reading people, too. This leads on to the second strongest point: the plot. I won't spoil anything, and I haven't gotten too far yet, but so far I'm absolutely enthralled by this game's story. The characters are all memorable (if unintentionally awful and hilarious) and the crime, concerning that of the ritualistic slaying of the town beauty Anna, is brilliantly thought out and genuinely interesting to experience and solve - which is the main storyline of the game.   Gameplay-wise, Deadly Premonition has so far been split into two sections: the 'open-world' section, during which one is free to travel (except for certain missions) around a clearly polygonal and badly textured landscape that is somehow full of character. York can interact with people, go to stores, complete side-missions, solve puzzles and look for clues pertaining to the case. He must also keep tabs on sleep and hunger, which both decrease over time and give debuffs to his stats.   The second section is the combat section, which is almost a dungeon crawl. Here, York encounters supernatural enemies and phenomenom, and has his run-ins with the games primary antagonist, The Raincoat Killer. As explained earlier, this section mostly involves shooting or battering down enemies (with melee weapons that break over time), solving puzzles and finding clues. A friend has told me it also grows to include chase-sequences and hiding-sequences in the future. York also has limited stealth capacity, in which he can hold his breath to become invisible to enemies. This has limited use, but is a good addition non-the-less. Shooting involves standing still and aiming the weapon, though guns have a rather difficult to see laser sight which makes aiming at distance hard. Enemies are zombie-like, but can have sudden bursts of unnatural (and creepy) speed and groan out things like 'don't want to die' when you kill them. The two primary stats in combat are health and heart-rate/stamina. Health is self explanatory, while stamina is interesting in that it contributes to your tiredness, but also decides how long you can sprint and hold your breath. Your stamina recovers quickly when idle, so it's not a big problem.   One of the most interesting things about these supernatural sequences is York's reaction.. Or lack thereof. He doesn't actually seem to give a â¥â¥â¥â¥ that all these completely insane and clearly supernatural-in-origin things are going on. He never reacts negatively, nor does he ever tell anyone or even so much as ask 'did you see that?!'. It's part of his charm, and makes sense in that it adds to the possibility York might actually be a fearless, no-â¥â¥â¥â¥-giving psychopath, or at least a cold-hearted â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.   I HIGHLY recommend this game to EVERYONE. This is one of the few games that gets a perfect score from me... An absolute 10/10, despite the poor graphics and PS2-era gameplay.

1905	0	a	  Shallow gameplay. Along the lines of FarCry's radio tower missions except there's one every 20ft. Each point is as simple as killing 1-2 guys, then pressing E on a radio. Even on the hardest mode, it's a walk in the park. Gunplay is basic at best. LMGs, Rifles, doesn't matter, they all respond the same; First bullet always fires straight. Should not be sniping with an LMG, but yet here we are.  Great environment, great concept, terrible storytelling, unengaging gameplay.  Note: Even after the promised patch, the game runs terribly. 780ti running everything on medium and still getting dips below 50fps. Don't even try and play it without VSync, it's just non-stop screen tearing.  If Homefront 1 was too linear, Homefront 2 is too open. Swing and a miss.

1372	1	a	Zombie Driver HD is a vehicle combat game that places you in a post-zombie apocalyptic city where itâs just you, the road and a bloody mess of zombie bodies. Outfit your car with machine guns, flame throwers and missile launchers and match the style of fun and gameplay with the likes of Twisted Metal and Death Race for the NES. Getting tired of killing zombies with a gun? How about using a car? It is as much fun as it sounds and a nice addition to a genre that doesnât get as much love as it once did.   http://iamericm.com/2014/03/zombie-driver-hd-indie-game-review/

566	1	a	'Lucius' Developed by Shiver Games and published by Lace Mamba Global. It was released October 26th 2012. The game is set in the 1970âs and is a horror adventure game.   Gameplay 6/10  I enjoyed the game play. I walked into the game blind so I didnât have any expectations. Itâs in third person. You move with the usual WASD keys. The game is linear so you donât have much choice in what happens. But, itâs got a nice story to it. Only thing I really disliked was the way they implemented the third person cam without the option of a first person view. It got awkward in some instances trying to kill someone. You also donât talk the entire game. So, if you like silent protagonists, Lucius(character) is for you.   Music/sound 5/10  The soundtrack for this game really helped set the mood for the things you were doing. It really helped in the immersion of the game. Iâm not sure what other people thought about the voice acting. But at certain times it was nice and other times not so much. Creativity 6/10 This story was rather nice, I liked it. All through the game the story is nice; the narration between chapters is done well. But, the one thing that broke me was the ending. Left so many questions unanswered. Other than that itâs a normal adventure game.   Graphics 8/10  The graphics are nice considering this is an indie game. The fires are decent, though with my testing on lower graphics theyâre a bit blocky for the poor low end computers out there. Not pretty. But, on the highest setting theyâre fine.   Replay Value 5/10  The replay value of this game isnât much. But, if you want to kill a few people while following a decent story, I can see you coming back to this.   Enjoyment 8/10  Maybe Iâm a sadistic person. I really enjoyed finding out how to murder the people without getting caught quite fun. I had a blast with the death cutsceens as well.   Overall 6.5/10  This is a decent game. I recommend it to anyone who likes linear adventure/puzzle games. It has a satisfactory story and you get satisfaction for killing the people. Just donât expect an over the top ending, it leaves you with questions.    References.

285	0	a	I was actaully pretty excited about this game so maybe I went into it with higher expectations than what I should have had.  All in all, it was a good buy for the summer sale; I got it really cheap (like $5 or something like that?). It's a fun concept and the progression with the powers seem nifty, but it's mostly the side quests that put me off. If they had a better tracking system for side quests, it would be a bit more fun, but they expect you to navigate a house you have no idea how to navigate. The only help you get is a map that only shows the direction of the main quest, but if you want to do any of the additional quests (which I did), you have to look up guides on how to find things, otherwise your'e scouring an enormous mansion without any direction or hint on where to look.  I don't have a problem doing the chores, but they need to give you a hint on where to find things - even if it's just a little one. You're either spending too much time trudging around the house looking for things, or you're looking it up online.  The voice acting and facial animations are poorly done. That's not TOO important for me, but it was a bit distracting from the cut scene.

The game portion of it isn't that bad, but you're just playing it to see what happens next.   Or you could just watch Twin Peaks (Oh damn, betcha never heard that one before).

The game has a David Lynch inspired cooky story that goes in some surprising directions, the cast of characters are diverse and are fun to interact with.  A great game but also a terrible one. It's like a great B-Movie in that I can't recommend it to everyone but if you think you'll enjoy it you probably will... just give it a couple hours to sink in and come to the terms with the fact that the minute to minute gameplay is nothing to write home about!  8/10

1752	1	a	If you liked Far Cry, you'll probably like this game too. Similar open world w/stronghold mechanics. And the weapon system is really unique and clever and I like it. I don't finish most games, but I expect I'll make it to the end of this one.  Also, unlike most similar games, I feel like enemy bullets are actually truly dangerous and it's easy to be stupid and get yourself killed. It takes very little damage to bring your health low, and it takes a long time to recover if you don't use a health kit. If you don't use cover or actually pay attention to your surroundings, you can die pretty fast. And I think this is a very good thing, it keeps the character from feeling overpowered even when you have a good arsenal, and it avoids the problem of enemy bullets just not feeling threatening. And conversely, enemies don't take too many bullets to kill either.

You play as a kid and follow orders from the devil to kill people.  he has to kill an order of people in the most craziest way ever. Animations can sometimes be funky. You have to do something first before the person will die. Sometimes u have to do some side tasks to be 'a good boy' which will unlock other things. You have to explore around and collect some items. The music is very well done too! You can have mulitple profiles.  You CAN'T play with the controller, which is a shame. Because their is potential for it.

You are a cabbie who winds up in the middle of a zombie outbreak and gets press-ganged into working for the military. But he gets chainguns on his cab so cool I guess. You shoot stuff and get money. Three different modes: Story, Blood race, and Slaughter. Story you know, Blood Race is best out of X number of rounds tournaments with different game modes and slaughter is arena zombie killing. Stupid fun, moderately easy to 100%. Get it sucka.
1015	1	a	Reading other reviews there's a lot of condemnation for a linear point and click style strictly story line game. Makes a change really with all the open world games out there and 'lets see how many different ways you can come up with to kill people'. If you want open world, free choice on actions and outcomes then this game is definately not for you. It's basically a game version of The Omen type story. Without giving too much away, small boy, spawn of satan, kill you family and develop your powers. It's very imaginative in how there is little guidance and you actually have to think on how the game wants you to do the murders without getting caught, with only a little guidance on where your next move takes you. All in all I believe it is a charming little game dedicated to one of the classics in the horror genre which puts you in the place of the demon child. If you like point and click type games, free roaming but with a very scripted storyline and an intelligent game you have to think about then I would definately recommend this game! :)

1852	1	a	Whilst this game has had very mixed press and user feedback I can honestly say that i am thoroughly enjoying it. The mix of stealth with run and gun keeps me wanting to push on through the missions, regardless of how unlikely the plotline is. Having read lots of poor feedback on the game and lack of mission variety i can honestly say that i have found the game to be as enjoyable as i found Far Cry 3 and Assassins Creed. Yes it still has issues, most noticeably around the spawn in and out of enemies which can be random and which do affect continuity at times. Having said that i would not say that this in any way detracts from the playability of the game and with the weapon variety you will find lots of ways to push through the KPA checkpoints, THe graphics and feel of the Philadelphia setting and oppressing actions of the KPA are a great feature and I would whole heartedly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the FC3's of this world. Yes it has bugs, yes it can sometimes drop frames but on a GT970 and i7 i am seeing 55 - 60 fps consistently and really enjoying it. My advice: if you are looking for a polished AAA shooter then go buy Doom. If however you want something a bit less mindless (and challenging) then you could do a hell of a lot worse than play Homefront The Revolution.

The story might seem a bit strange to begin with, but while you explore the giant world you'll find various pieces of lore that helps with the bigger picture.  The game builds around a very simple puzzle mechanic: you can switch between a girl that can jump and climb, and a ball that can bounce higher and move faster. This works very well, and you'll meet some smart puzzles throughout the game where this comes in good use.  Even the art style is beautiful. Almost every single room has some uniqueness to it, and there's so many crazy creatures (knytts) you'll meet. Also, the music is very fitting.  I can only give this game a high recommendation.

1697	1	a	Taking advantage of the free weekend to try it out. I'm really surprised at the negative reviews. The major issue I see is that the AI is bad and the game is too easy so far on the normal setting. I am a huge fan of the Far Cry series and any game that copies that formula is a lot of fun for me. I would say that if you enjoyed Far Cry 3-4, Crysis 3, the Metro series, and Dying Light, I have trouble believing you wouldn't like this. This coming from a guy who thought that the some of the recent big hit titles were pretty dull (e.g., MGSV and Fallout 4). I have a GTX 970 with an i5, when I got out into the open world the FPS dropped down below 60. Wasn't actually clocking the FPS, but guessing it was 40-47ish, so I dropped down from the Very High preset to High, and it seems to be very stable and close to 60. I even have TAA on. Plenty of room to tweak if I had FPS issues. I haven't played much so far, but I may buy it while it is on sale. If not, I will certainly buy it when it drops down to $15.
1270	1	a	Only get this game if you have a gamepad game has keyboard controls but it's not precise enough in my opinion. also of note is that keyboard controls can't be configured although I worked around it by using autohotkey.  recommended because I can't say I'm not recommending it with the very little I played (yes I'm missing a gamepad)

2966	1	a	An obscure game known for being the most polarizing horror game ever, Deadly Premonition delivers a memorable experience. Despite bargain bin graphics and gameplay, the cast of bizzare characters make up for it, alongside the strange story. The PC port is unfortunately terrible, providing no graphics options, locked 720p resolution, locked 30fps, (According to Framerate Police) potential degrade in performance over time, failing to start on Windows 8, and frequent crashing. A mod called dpfix by the same dude that made the beautiful dsfix for Dark Souls' infamous PC port fixes issues and gives graphics options to the player. Now play this and make a Sinners' Sandwich.

2402	0	a	I wouldn't write anything more than other already do but this game is not very inspired, it is hard to go on with this revolution, you simply don't feel anything at all, after you play enough with gun system, unlock gadgets and so on there is nothing more to do and keep you playing. And on top of this all that open world weakness go there and liberate another 'radio tower' or something like that thi,s time waster and you have to do that to progress and it is painful. Enemy AI is bad, spawning system is even worse, enemies sometimes just spawn behind your back and say surprise with bullet! :)  on plus side there time splitters 2 in this game if you will play long enough trough story to discover it, so it is not that bad after all :)

2362	1	a	I picked it up after all the patches and I enjoyed it very much. The world is split up into sectors and essentially every sector is an 'open world'. You normally start in a section and the North Koreans (what a stupid storyline though) control the sector. You move through the map and take over key buildings, doing flash missions, finding hideouts with loot and ammo, jumping around on rooftops until you finally own most of the section, or at least enough to get to the next part of the story.  Then you move onto the next sections and repeat. I liked it because when you own an entire section you basically run around with impunity and your guns out blazing. When you go into a new sector there are now guys everywhere again so you have to revert back to a stealth mode and sneak around again until you build up more safe controlled areas. I love the style of game play, the weapons, just the storyline is really dumb (NK taking over the US through backdoors in tech).   However I say that and the voice acting and character subplots are fairly interesting which kept me engaged for most of the game. It was really fun and I revisit it every couple months now. Can't wait for this expansion.  btw I play 4K@45-60 FPS with an amd-8350 and nvidia 1070

2939	1	a	A solid game with some of the best characters in any game i've ever played and an amazing, gripping, hilarious, and interesting story that will suck you in and wash away the PS2-tier mistakes the game has.  It's one of my favourite games of all time, get it on xbox360 or ps3 though, the PC Port is quite terrible and will test your patience.   It's like a really good, cheesy movie in the shell of a mediocre game. It's hard to explain, you really need to play it. Do not pay full price for it on PC though.

22	1	a	Not exactly like the mainstream mobas , mainly because of your direct involvement in your tem's victory. I would give this one a 7/10 , mainly because of lack of items. You can make a truly unique hero despite of a small roster , and contribute in your team's victory in various ways. That being said , items sadly lack diversity , and you will find yourself reapeating one and the same build throughout the game. About the actual gameplay , as said before , you contribute to your team's victory in more than one way , capturing checkpoints to spawn additional minions , or instead of investing gold on yourself , you can invest it in upgrades for your own team , from purchasing smaller death penalties to upgrading minions , and a lot more. To summarize , although it is truly fun for a while , it eventualy bores out , since there isnt enough replayable content.
2451	1	a	Best of cRPG game in decade. One of best games I have ever played. This game has a soul. I recomend any RPG fan who like good plot ,setting , music and very dynamical combat system . I hope that will be sequel soon.

3972	1	a	 Early Access Review
3101	1	a	I already was a fan of Nifflas' knytt games, so I purchased this one. It's definitely worth the money.  The game is first of all visually impressive - just as expected. Sometimes I wonder a bit if the experience wouldn't have been even better if the ground wasn't all black, throughout the whole world. One gets used to it, but the other knytt games had colored background, which looked a bit more friendly. However, it may be that black is a good choice to clearly differentiate between the background scenery and the ground you're walking on.  Storywise, well, forget the story. It is really not necessary. Surprisingly, this game is much more about characters than about story - something I didn't expect. There are *lots* of NPCs to talk to, and almost every one of them has an own story and personality. What impressed me most is that once you reach the third chapter, you don't have any red line to follow, so you get the dialogues between the two main (talking) characters in some random order depending on which places you visit in which order. But although there are some main themes repeatedly exploited in the dialogue, it never gets messed up if you change the order. As for the dialogue itself, it's really excellently crafted and highly intelligent.  While you're exploring the - really vast - world, you'll also explore the protagonists and the history of this world. Most games are about story advancement (and sometimes character advancement), but this one is purely about exploration. There's so much to discover you'll hardly remember an area you already visited. The game also features quite some subtle humor if you pay attention.  And did I mention the soundtrack yet? It's awesome.  Now, nothing is perfect. I'll flag the following comments as spoiler although it really is just a very mild one.    One thing I don't like about this game is that it's breaking the forth wall. Having the protagonists talk to the author talking steals away some of the atmosphere. But this only happens rarely, so it's forgivable. Another thing is that one does not get to know the main protagonist much. We do get to know something about her family, but almost nothing about herself. I know that this is a usual technique to make the player identify himself with the protagonist, but in this world where everyone else has a story, it's really strange that the protagonist lacks one. We don't even know whether she actually cannot speak or just doesn't want to.    Oh, and the super secret challenges section is really, really,  really  nasty.  &lt;rant&gt;Just one last side note: I really cannot understand why this game got an M rating by the ESRB. Is critical thinking forbidden for teens in the USA? Yeah, it may be offensive if you're some fundamentalist, but seriously, why should such people dictate which games are appropriate for teens? Here in Germany, it's approved for age 12 and up.&lt;/rant&gt;
3050	1	a	compared to similar games, this has a tremendous amount of gameplay, adding up to around 24 hours. I recommend this for all fans of metroidvania games and I definetely recommend buying it at full price as it is much deeper than similarly priced indie games which only last around 4 hours on average.  Also, this has one of the best controls ever in a platformer and if anything I recommend buying this just so you can enjoy platforming the way it is meant to be enjoyed.  Oh, in case you are wondering about the M rating... have you played LISA? well...

275	1	a	Lucius - This game is good, its not the best though. I'd only buy it if it was on sale.  This game is very entertaining to play, the different death's throughout the game are quite good, however I think this game would be better if you could decide how to kill each person yourself. Like if you had several choices of how to kill each person.  I think the different powers you get when playing are okay, but I think they might have been a bit pointless for some parts since you barely use one or two of them. But that's my opinion I guess.   I do recommend this game, its a real time killer if your waiting for a better game to download or something, haha! Just buy it when its on sale, Â£14.99 is a bit much for a game that is only about 4-5 hours of gameplay.

384	1	a	At first i was not impressed with this, then slowly it began to grow on me. I bought this game in promise of a sandbox type serial killer game but this is not the case. Instead the game tasks you to kill specific Help around the house and it is your job to move things around and set up the perfect kill. As far as the sandbox experience goes, you can move seemingly random objects around the house and place them anywhere.  The game places you in the shoes of a seemingly innocent six-year old boy as he is celebrating his sixth birthday. Just so happens that this boy is not your average kid, he happens to be a literal spawn of Satan. Or Lucifer obviously implied by the developers naming the kid 'Lucius'. Lucifer wants souls and it is your job to give it to him. One day every month you are tasked to kill employees and family members who reside within the house. Every kill challenges you with intricate puzzles, easy or not depending on your skill level (I finished the game in seven hours). The story is not ground breaking, just your typical murder mystery manor. But it is pretty amusing to watch the mental health of your family members deteriate as they try to figure out who is commiting the murders. Towards the end, you are given the choice of what type of ending you want. Action or puzzle, given for players who like puzzles or action, or both.  Overall this game is really good and i would definitely recommend this game for my friends.

3021	1	a	Knytt Underground is a 2D platform game of exploration with a quirky story. You play as Mi Sprocket who is a mute sprite. She is chosen to go on a quest (because her brother freaked out or something) to ring the six bells in order to prevent the world from being destroyed. Along the way she picks up two pixies who are her voice. Dora and Cilia couldn't be more polar opposite. One is kind and considerate. The other is brazen and brash.  The first two 'Chapters' of the game are a kind of tutorial. The first shows you Mi. She can run and jump and climb. She also picks up colored lights and can activate them for a one time special power.   The second introduces you to Bob. Bob is a ball, and can bounce. Pretty high. He also can create a static field around him that will pull him to special robots to allow him to play Tarzan the ball.  This will take about 90 minutes. Then you get to meat of the game...Chapter three. The map in Chapter three is a rectangle 30 by 48 (1440) screens. Plus several secret areas not on the map including a small inverted world and you have a huge world to explore.   There are side quests to complete and some symbols hidden in what seem to be extremely inaccessible areas. There are other sprites and pixies around the world that tell a quirky story about some sprite 'religions' having to do with technology.   The environments are unique. The different areas of the underground each come with different theme music. The part I liked best was trying to get items that seemed to be inaccessible. Many times you look at a screen and say 'No way' can that item be picked up. Then you go through the game and learn some tricks that will allow you pick them up. The mapping system does a good job marking these items (i) as well as quests (Q) on your map.  There have been many discussions around the internet regarding the controls for this game. Personally, I didn't find them to be an issue. I have been playing games with a keyboard for a very long time. Arrows to move, 'A' to use the special power, and 'S' to switch between states. The only issues that I had were on some of the timing puzzles and pressing the wrong button (A instead of S). I thought keyboard controls worked well with the game.  I would say to try the demo, but this only lets you play through the first chapter. While this will give you some feel for the game, the real meat and potatoes is in the third chapter. All I can say is I had a lot of fun exploring this game and having the story unfold.

2	1	a	Best MOBA I've seen so far. It's got everything and actually requires you to think your next move and also empowers you as player to contribute to victory other than 'win teamfight -&gt; game over' base destroyed before enemy respawns back. Some players in your team can push lanes, others can capture towers, others can upgrade your own towers or units or citadel or even spawn multiple types of minions/archers/balistas/angels/giants etc. You could go capture some mines or that all round wanted +20% Experience Flag or the infamous +15% HP and EVEN upgrade yourself with multiple spawn-able units that you directly control yourself and that can be purchased from the shop. There's a lot of diversity in maps as there are many of them and unlike other mobas this one actually has mods! You know things that upgrade your UI, bot AI, Extra items etc.  I'm having a blast playing this game and would recommend it to anyone who likes MOBA games because it is unique in this genre.

29	1	a	Top down tower defense game with unique map layout. Very basic tower defense game (TDG) that has single player 'skirmish' and multiplayer modes, from 1 vs. 1 to 5 vs. 5 players.  It feels like it wasn't meant to be a full online / multiplayer experience like other TD games. Game didn't get popular enough to compete with League of Legends, Heroes of Newearth and other tower defense games. Has unique maps, not your average 'creeps run in line to enemy base' layout. Limited number of 'Heroes', your basic melee and ranged types, nukers, tanks and supports.  Character design is good with great abilities, animation, model quality and textures. Environment quality is really basic, not a lot of detail, mostly stone, concrete grey surfaces, with magic and arrow towers. Maps are located in 'space', looks like you're battling in 'divine heights' after all. There are different places on maps that you can capture, some add gold income, some increase creep health and damage, others boost your health / mana regeneration, etc.  You can buy items for head, chest, belt, boots, gloves, accessory slots as well as buy special 'Hero summonable creeps' - ranged, melee and healer types, that you can control and resummon if killed through the match. Killing creeps, enemy heroes and capturing objectives on map grant you experience, thus you level up. Maximum level is 20, and each time you level you can spend points to upgrade your HERO '1234 aka QWER' abilities or upgrade the BASE skills (creep health, add unique creeps to waves, etc.).  Game doesn't feel like your typical TDG, and is somewhat unique. Downside is that not many people play multiplayer, and there's not much diversity to keep you going for long time. Game itself is a short and basic TD experience, that I personally enjoyed playing.

2815	1	a	I'm a weird individual and this is a weird game. So the two of us got on like a house on fire. Due to the low budget, the gameplay mechanics, graphic and sound aren't all that refined. Despite all that this game has charm and a lot of it. Its twin peak setting is pretty unique and there is lots to do in this open world survival horror. In fact this is the first true open world survival horror game I can think of (Silent Hill doesn't count). Despite the simple gameplay mechanics it does play like resident evil 4 with its over the shoulder gunplay. While the controls really need sorting out, the game is still fun to play. However while the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions have a few glitches, this PC port has lots. There is nothing game breaking but you will find a lot of missing textures, frame rate problem and sometimes mechanical problems like the controller not being responsive. This is best played with mouse and keyboard because the controller controls are clunky and are pretty much broken for the most part.   Despite all its flaws I had a hell of a time playing this. There is a reason why I have bought this on every platform and that reason is because of its originality. Swery65 is basically suda 51 and Hideo kojima as one. He has a vision that only Suda 51 can understand and he has the ambition of Hideo Kojima. He is pretty much the perfect developer and D4 looks like it will kick the walking dead's â¥â¥â¥â¥.   I hope the will be a sequel or a prequel so that I can witness this experience again.

2292	1	a	I was not expecting anything out of this game, never played any of its previous ones, I just got it because my friend was all hyped over it. TBPH This game is quite fun, I have only played the Co-op multiplayer, but it was all enjoyable, even though we only actually sucessfully completed a single mission after opening it up to pub and getting 2 more to help, after ~2 hours.  I think the 'performance issues' are Intel based, sell outs, my AMD FX 8350 and GTX 970 runs fine on near max settings (gotta lower that gdamn antialiasing) at ~70-80 fps, but yeah.  On a side Note: I never understood why people complain about the whole aiming mechanics in these types of games, either for or against bullet drop etc, I mean these games are NOT shooting simulators, if you would like the pinpoint accuracy and bullet drop or w/e of a shooting simulator, go play COD or CS:GO or some boring e-sport game like that.  Was it worth the money? I'd say yes. If you do not have someone to play with perhaps not.

2367	1	a	I played this game during the FREE WEEKEND on steam.  Now the review. I went into this game excited as I've been watching this game ever since it was announced but was saddened by all the negative reviews. When there was a free weekend I was stoked and tried it out.  First off the graphics are very detailed and the lighting effects are amazing. Just the general atmoshpere is really immersive as you feel like you are living within an occupied city. The story seems a bit far fetched but hey its still a good game.  Secondly I will say that from the time I played it I realise why people were mad about the game as you do need a beefy computer in order to run it but they have released patches to make the game run smoother but since I do not have the game yet I do not know how big of a change this has had. Luckily my computer is beefy and ran the game very well.  So overall I enjoyed it but do admit the game was unoptimized at the time and a slightly beefy computer was required for this game. Once I buy the game I'll update my review to give a more complete review of it.

Yeah there are sometimes still performance dips below 60 on certain locations but 90% of the time it is above 80 and feels smooth. There are still minor bugs to iron out, but the overall experience is good and im having fun with the game now. Thx for the great 2.0 patch!

1975	1	a	I've had some time now in both the single and multiplayer game. First of all I have NO ISSUES with the graphics. I am using a 750TI (stop laughing) with the latest driver and even on medium am getting no slow down that I can see.   The single player game at first feels a little on rails and with that being the biggest complaint of the original game that was scary, but once you get out of the 'tutorial' it becomes much more open world and feels sorta similar to like the Gotham games and Assassins Creed in that you can run around the map doing a variety of activities and follow the story mission as you please.   The multiplayer is more similar to a game like Vermintide ... you start off in a lobby where you can customize your character and set your loadout etc .. but then you join missions in four man groups and run them. This was a tiny bit disappointing to me as I was hoping for a open world co-op campaign, but that said I loved Vermintide so I am also enjoying this. As you progress you earn money and XP to unlock skills and buy crates that have all kinds of things from guns to gear to customization opens in them.   Combat feels fine to me. The guns are responsive enough and I am especially enjoying both the shotgun and marksman rifle. The cover system works well enough and theres a good enough variety of norks to keep it interesting and force you to think through encounters.   Overall this was a game I was waiting for and so far I dont feel let down by it. Or at least not enough that I would recommend against its purchase. In fact I am trying to drag my friends who I played Vermintide in with me. :3

2284	0	a	No, no, no and definitely no. Don't even bother, I can't imagine someone thought people will like 'this'. Has no feel to it, completely generic rip off. Intros you can't skip and a number of issue right at the start.
1537	1	a	  good game .loving it .don't think i will have it finished by tomorrow. so ill be buying it soon
2566	1	a	You know what I love about this game? Everything.  I show this game off all the time and most people think I'm joking. I first played this back in 2012. This is genuinely my favorite game of all time.  The story is like if you took Twin Peaks, translated it into Japanese, had a dude translate it back into English and then had another guy try to read back the lines in Japanese having only seen a couple of English sitcoms. Basically what I'm saying is it's amazing, it has so many twists and major plot points that left me stunned. One of the most satisfying boss fights of all time against a gay cross dressing man. Characters that were likeable and kooky in their own way and made me wish some of their fates turned out different. Some of the most memorable and funny lines in the world 'FK in the coffee' and 'The answer is [onion]' The graphics while lackluster contribute to the off-kilter world of Greenvale.  The only downside is this version crashes all the time and the PS3/Xbox version is slow as hell.  This game is pretty swell.
713	0	a	Lucius is a game about a little boy named Lucius who, on his 6th birthday, is approached by Satan, who is apparently his father. Lucius then begins killing inhabitants of the mansion in different ways in order to give his father souls. I was very excited to play this game, especially when I bought it on sale for $1.49, but I ended up disappointed. I felt that the storyline was very generic, and since I played with a controller, I also felt that the controls were sort of awkward, particularly when using telekinesis. One of the things I found most annoying was that the instructions on what to do were sometimes very vague. For instance, when asked to take the trash out, not only would I have to go searching for the trash, but also for a place to take it to. Then at one point the game hinted that I should find some way to mess with one of the inhabitants, but I spent 30 minutes running around having no clue how to do it. On top of that, the map was sort of confusing and the game crashed the first time I tried to change the resolution. This game is really fun whenever I know what I'm doing, but it gets frustrating when I spend thirty minutes looking for one item or place because I'm not very observant. The graphics are really good but I wouldn't spend more than $5 on this game.
998	0	a	Bought this game and it's broken, I can't even get through the intro because the items won't cycle, my mouse wheel works fine, and about half the time when I bring up my notepad, nothing. not that it maters because I can't progress any further.
1049	1	a	Its a fun puzzle-game, and the puzzles are all about killing people with unnatural powers. If you ever watch 'The Omen',- this is the game varriant.
2655	1	a	Solve crimes.  Fight zombies.  Talk to your imaginary friend.  Shave your beard.  Oh â¥â¥â¥â¥ is that a giant zombie dog behind my car?  That is a giant zombie dog behind my car.  Don't read the achievements' descriptions.  FUN.

2597	1	a	I mean, the game is objectively bad in many ways. I'm not going to tell you differently. But the ways in which it are bad are honestly what make it so amazing.  The absolute silliness of the plot, yet still manages to be surprising at points. The characters in the town itself whch give you ridiculous â¥â¥â¥ quests that make no sense. The ridiculously realistic driving simulator that makes the drive between missions actually be like 5 minutes of driving with no other action. It's so good and yet... well.  it's one of those games you have to play through at least once, probably twice, to really appreciate. It's just uhh... play it. It's easily one of my favourite games ever, and I honestly have no idea why.
2753	1	a	Worst game i've played in my life. Best game of all time.  0/10 10/10  You will suffer it like a torture. You will enjoy it like an org*sm.  You will NEVER forget it.  Don't ask. Just play it.
546	1	a	Good game. Think Hitman, but it takes place in a Mansion and you play as Lucifer's son. I Love the detail on Lucius, he looks like a ....devil.  Performance could be better, I was playing on a lower end laptop and it ran, but stutterd every now and again. Would still rec for good story, setting, and very immersive.  7/10
2163	0	a	The first hour is ok. Then you realize you will spend the entire game shooting the same guy. Then you refund it.
2674	1	a	I love this game. I've waited a long time to play, and had my prejudices, but I was quickly drawn into the story, it kept me interested all the way to the end. The graphics are sub-par, but that can be partially amended with a tool called dpfix. Acting and writing are hilarious at some points, I have to admit this game isn't really scary - but it delivers a few scares in the combat sections.   Overall, I had a very pleasant experience, I played the game with a walkthrough as I didn't want to miss useful items (or get them too late in the game). Maybe due to that the game hasn't been too difficult, but I don't see that as an issue - it was a very pleasant ride. Side quests are optional, and they do add a bit of game time, but, as mentioned, some yield quite useful items.

Nothing to say more. Get it and play it! But don't listen to other people, saying you have to play on hardest difficulty right from the start to get all the fun. Just don't, you'll hate the game. Finish the game on normal or easy and only then switch on Hard mode. Fun guaranteed!

2142	1	a	Despite my low level rigs, i'm playing on high-ultra (not all ultra) @55-60 fps on combat, too.  The story, meh: you are recruited from the resistance of Philadelphia and have to free the leader (will i become leader myself?). Not the best, nor the worst.  Gameplay: is similar to Far Cry titles(conquer posts, free hostages and so on), only aiming is a bit more difficult (which is not bad). Tutorials take you till a certain point, then it's up to you if follow the main story or do secondary missions/recon.  Graphic: i'm liking it by now. It's 'enough' for me. You can check it by yourself on youtube, anyway.  Almost 3 hours and no bugs, no crashes, no passages blocked by npcs. I am probably one of the lucky ones.   I hope that it helps.

592	0	a	Decent game. 6/10 The graphics are pretty well designed. The gameplay is a bit akward. It submerges you into the game with hardly any instruction. I was stuck on the second murder.  It's not worth the money unless you just enjoy figuring out stuff on your own.
2581	1	a	This game is one of the worst I've ever played, and I love every single second of it. From the begining, it is clear that a lot of love went into it, if only that love and care were equaled by skill and budget. The port is perhaps one of the worst ever made, lacking any graphical options whatsoever and being unplayable without a controller, to get any kind of control at all you need to install a fanmade patch or two. This isn't even getting into the myriad of glitches, poor audio mixing, and graphics that would make a dreamcast look down in shame, but there is way more too this game than all the technical problems.  You see, here is where the love comes in. From the begining, every character in the game is memorable, each has there own personality, traits, and even a unique schedule. The plot is fantastic and engaging, and at times even heartfelt and moving. It has a fantastic sense of offbeat humour that will remind enlightened players of Twin Peaks. Actually, the entire game will remind people of Twin Peaks, because from the setting to the characters to the music this game is a love letter to all things David Lynch. It should be no surprise that its flaws are just part of the charm, and together they make the game seem more complete for it.  Seriously, buy this game if you haven't already, you won't regret it.

308	1	a	This is a brutally dark and amazing game. If you really believe you are Lucius, the 6yr old spawn of satan, than you really understand how twisted and psychologically messed up this game truly is and you can really admire its beauty.  Pros: ~You are the 6yr old spawn of satan called Lucius. The story is quite intriguing because of this. ~It is challenging because there are unique (though linear) ways to complete objectives. ~The magical abilities are a nice added touch because the player does not feel like a normal 6yr child. ~Great narrative during cutscenes. Its very interesting to hear a different perspective on the events taking place. ~Relatively short game. 15-20hrs one walkthrough. But if you REALLY like the story/game you want MOAR! ~Realistc. In the sense that, the people in the home, act like theyre just living in a home and do random house things.   Cons:  ~ number one con. The game is too short. Simple 15-20hrs to complete (maybe shorter) but youre left wanting more. ~Sometimes the objectives are confusing. You have to complete objectives in a specific way which might not be obvious. ~You end up running into walls ..... A lot..... (ps. Hold shift to run. I didnt know this and spent at least half of the game walking at slow human child speed) ~The character models aren't top notch. They dont look realistic. This doesnt bother me but it might bother others. ~Controls are bothersome when first learning how to use abilities.  ~Telekinises needs work, levaiting and placing objects is just messy but can be overlooked because its not used often. ~ Cutscenes. A lot of cutscenes. You dont like cutscenes? you might not like this. You like cutscenes? ignore this con.  PS: Don't Agree with me if you have played the game? THATS FINE!!  EVERY GAMER experiences one game differently regardless if your a twin, a quadruplet, a lover of all games etc etc. Agree to Disagree. I listed what might be noticeable cons to the game but THAT DOES NOT MEAN that the game is horrifically bad, EVERY game has AT LEAST one good aspect to it, even if its not obvious.

102	1	a	I'd recommend this game to some people who have a few friends looking for some fun to be had. I play this with my dad a lot, and we usually play against three to four enemies on Nightmare mode. This game isn't meant to have an incredible storyline (sure, it's fun to see what havoc your demigod would wreak upon the world, but honestly, I don't always have time to play ten rounds of the same repeating map over and over just to see that little snipit) but it is incredibly fun to play with some friends. Yes, there aren't a lot of classes to choose from, but the fact that there are a good amount with a large skill tree for you to go down, a few varying mapas, AND the ability to change game types (conquer, fortress, etc.), it makes the game worthwhile.  If you don't have several friends (and hey, I'm not judging) who want to play a fun and tactical game with you, then I would say don't get it. But if you have at least one friend who wants to play a few rounds with or against you, then definitely, you should pick up the game and at least give it a try.

Their is some performance issues and im sure some patches to come will help on this. I like the mix of Dying light Parkour/Crafting Mechanics and the Openworld and the FPS style of guns and different types and mods for them. Not to mention gear for yourself so all in all a very customizable item game. The story I find interesting and the drive to free America from the Rule of the KPA is pretty out there idea but fun to toy with.  Im glad I picked this title up myself.

2612	1	a	It's such a good game, unfortunatley a lazy effort on the developers part. At launch there was no controller support, however that has now been patched, but the game itself can still be borderline unplayable unless patched with DPfix (the same person who fixed the Dark Souls port). Even with that patch however the game still suffers from a range of glitches, bugs, crashes and audio/visual problems, still it's hard to not recommend this game. After all it's problems have been sorted out, this is easily one of the best games on Steam, with a good sense of humor and some nice references to certain things in pop culture (such as Twin Peaks), you might want to hold of purchasing it until ALL of the problems have been fixed.

1019	0	a	Lucius is a puzzle game, where the puzzle to solve is murder.  The replayability is very low. The puzzles aren't always challenging, just frustratingly clueless. And often repetitive.  I finished it under 5 hours. The only reason I have so many hours on this game is for that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ achievement. 40 hours ? Really ? Nobody would ever play this game for that long without the achievement there ...
1741	1	a	Just finished it, overall I enjoyed it, took me two days to finish it.  Played it on medium on a gtx 970 with 60 fps, still looked nice enough for me. Everybody keeps complaining about bugs, I got 3 crashes and everytime the game crashed the keyboard settings were mixed up. Still, that's not so many bugs. Oh and once a civilian NPC made me stuck in a corridor, so I ended up kiling him.   I wanted to play this game like an infiltration game, but the stealth part is a bit wooky-dooky if you know what I mean. Hs don't os with the silenced pistol so that makes it even harder.  I bought it for 23 euros and I don't feel like I wasted my money, 20 hours to finish and FPS is kind of unusual nowadays.  I haven't tried the coop part, I'll update my review once I have !
1436	1	a	such game. much fun. wow
373	1	a	i liked the game enough to play it through, but it was a very rough cut out of what could have been a great game. the npc's constantly repeat the same things over and over which gets quit irritating. there aren't many clues to go off of so switching between abilities to see what may work as an option is quit frequent and often i needed to resort to youtube for help. the story is pretty bad in script and logic. however i will still give it a thumbs up because it was everything that i expected to be which was a low budget b film video game take on the movie 'the omen'. my final words on it is 'to get it on discount'.
2917	1	a	Zach, could you recommend this?
1893	1	a	I don't really understand the hate about that game, I get 55~75 fps on ultra with a single gtx 980 and the game is not that glitchy, I really enjoy it for now.
1973	1	a	So far this game is pretty awesome! The game plays alot like an 'urban warfare' Farcry. The graphics are awesome, gun customization is amazing (so are the animations of it). So far I have no complaints, i'll update the review when i've beaten the game, but i'm happy with my purchase :D.   Ps. The game is getting alot of bad reviews, mostly seems to be because of optimization issues (or just people hating on new release games with the other cool kids). While the optimization could be much better, this game has incredible graphics and i'm running it fine at 4k. Hopefully Dambuster will keep the game updated and maybe add some cool stuff to it like the devs of dying light did. This game is pretty awesome already but with some love and care from the dev's could become a 9/10 or so. So, if you are having problems running the game, these issues should hopefully be fixed soon.   980ti i7 4790k at 4 GHZ 16 GB of ram Game installed on a 1tb SSD

3044	1	a	The whole Knytt series is worth playing, but this one (as far as I know) is the only one on Steam. Luckily for you, it's also the best.   Knytt games are all about exploration, puzzles, and platforming, in that order. They're very engrossing and it's fun to run, jump, climb, and bounce over the strange and beautiful world. The movement in this game feels great - once you hear your little feet scamper up a wall as you climb it you'll fall in love.  This series of games proves that indie games don't have to hide behind quirky graphics and a 'message' (*cough* LIMBO *cough*) to be worth playing. Knytt Underground is fun, it's interesting, and it's definitely worth your time. Pick it up today.
1540	1	a	I'm not sure how much staying power the game has, but as an in-the-moment sort of the game, it's very fun. There are still a few bugs present, but if you wait even longer than I did, and the developer continues to refine their game, it wouldn't be unwise to purchase it for even full price or on sale.  As for the game itself, think Far Cry gameplay filtered through Call of Duty and Metro, visually stark and atmospheric but tonally fatuous like an action movie. Can't say I approve of the overt jingoism either, as it turns to inanity a few times. Guess it's an American thing, like that guy running for governer, firing a minigun in his campaign ad.
1542	1	a	I gave it a whirl and really enjoyed it. Is it top shelf? No. Is it the best game I've ever played? Nope, but given the subject matter, setting, and the freedom to do things however you want I think it gets close to something I've been craving for a long time.  I think it's what it could be once the kinks are worked out. I'm tired of pretty shooters that are more about how the water and grass looks. I'm tired of rail shooters that make you look in the background and wish that you could go there in the game. This game is not perfect but it stirs something in me. It makes me hope there is more to come.  With the 50% discount this game is now part of my library. You should NOT spend $60 on this game but for the first time in a long time I'm excited to see where this game goes or the impact it has on other games in the genre.  Some have mentioned that the game lacks the subtleties of other 'chose your own path' games. I totally agree but the framework is there. I wish there was more emphasis on that kind of game play too but if you take the time to play around a bit you can make it as epic or straight forward as you want really.  It's definitely the fault of the current game design that leads you towards the easiest options. I don't enjoy run and gun in single player games. I like the option for silent kills, sneaking through the sewers, using the environment, or flying over the wall on a flaming motorcycle while riding a wheely like Evel Knievel. These take time to set up and you could have just mowed them all down in half the time but you don't have to. All of those options exist but only on the harder difficulties do you start searching them out. Again, not a perfect game but you can kind of set the 'fun level' for it however you see fit.  The more I play Resistance Mode the more I like it! As a matter of fact, I will try to follow up on my review after I finish the campaign but I haven't stopped playing Resistance Mode, lol! The only advice I'd give is to slow play the campaign. Don't go out and take over everything as fast as you can. Enjoy the setting and use the environment whenever you can to take out the Norks in the most epic way possible. You won't regret it!

2223	1	a	The game is a lot of fun, despite some issues with bugs and glitches here and there. Once they have been patched, I reckon it will be an extremely solid, fun semi-open world shooter.   The story is patchy, and pretty bland, but it's passable for a shooter.
2387	1	a	great game looks amazing :D but could do with some performance improvements
1761	0	a	The first two single player levels are based on the premise that you need to avoid the enemy and not kill them (because killing them calls in reinforcements). However, the game doesnt give you the normal tools of an avoidance game; i.e., no sneaking, no crawling, no means to kill without setting off alarms (e.g., radio jamming). They do give you the standard run and gun tools, which backfire here. So, this game (at least in the first two levels) appears internally inconsistent, making it more difficult than necessary.

1937	1	a	played 40mins on the free weekend so far. nice graphics, not too hard gameplay.  only shortcoming may be the fps, this games requires very good gpu. having 980m and putting most settings on high only with AA off still only yields 45-55ish fps. and some screen tearings here and there.
1776	1	a	When o brought this game i was prepared to face a horrible and full of bugs game since i read a lot of bad reviews about it, but i got a rich and nice finished one ! Very Fun and with nice mechanics like the upgrade of weapons and customiations, a lot of gears to buy, 'open world' with good space and a lot of things to do ! Dun know why ppl want aways a triple A game and if its not they threat it like â¥â¥â¥â¥, This game is cool. I not regret the buy. Game on.
1130	1	a	This game is so â¥â¥â¥â¥. I'm so glad I got it for free.
834	0	a	You play as the 6 year old spawn of Satan, and every month or so, you target a victim (well, the game targets one for you) and by ways of a puzzle you get him killed, so as to claim his soul for Satan. In return, Satan promises to make you stronger, and every once in a while will grant you a new ability or upgrade the level of one you already have. The abilities are senseless however (more on that later), and solving the puzzles so as to get to the killing or murdering is more of a chore (even if the 'rewarding cutscene' is entertaining). Speaking of chores, the game even has some for you. Luckily they don't seem to be mandatory, though the game doesn't really let you know at first. Completing enough boring chores, which will have you running an errand for someone or looking for an item you will only have the vaguest idea of where to find, would grant you presents. Which I couldn't find any use for.  The entire game is based in one big mansion (it does have a garden I guess), with some new parts of the mansion unlocking as you progress through the levels. Each time you wake up, the game gives you a new target. It's an interesting thing to call this one a horror title, because you are actually playing the horror yourself, and that doesn't help the game scare you in any way. Though some of the deaths are gruesome, the poor graphics and crippled animations almost make them funny. They're meant to be rather cringy though. The premise of the game is an interesting one, but it isn't bolstered by you playing it. The plot has something going for it with an interesting overarching theme of a detective trying to investigate what the hell is going on in the mansion, but it isn't especially good, it's just one of two things solid about this game. The other being that the voice acting is surprisingly well delivered, though it is too held back - by poor animations and character models.  The graphics are poor. Beyond outdated character models, bad lightning effects, the game is lacking in environmental shadows. The textures are at least decent. The animations are outdated, but by outdated standards, not the worst (especially the face animaitions). Sometimes they warrant a giggle or two. The biggest problem with the presentation however is to do with tonemaps, with many crushed blacks and oversaturated filters that make the game uneasy on the eyes, also during gameplay, it just doesn't look good and much of the detail is lost as a result (the problem is visible in the screenshots). No AA options is also a problem, and the game doesn't seem to support DSR.   The mansion is rather dull. You are restricted to the same, boring environment, which is rather big and confusing, with many rooms you'll find trouble keeping track of, simply filled with furniture and very little of things interesting to look at or find. The map has no useful indication of where a person is likely to be. The game does nothing to help you keep track of your objectives, or pursue them. It is a point and click puzzle in the most traditional way, with no freedom whatsoever to solving the puzzles. While that is fine, the game has some weird, or unintuitive solutions to some puzzles. Many times you'll just run around the house not sure where to go, what to do, and you will have to resort to a guide.  The abilities, and their levels, are pointless. While you can use telekinesis on objects instead of picking them up with your hand, every puzzle and every interaction relating to a puzzle is specific, you cannot decide which power to use in order to kill your victim, it's all predetermined. The game could just as well keep it more simple by tying your abilities into one button which would serve this one purpose of 'supernatural' tinkering with puzzle elements. The levels of those abilities also make no sense, there is no significance to the level of the ability you are using while solving puzzles and they are gained through story-progression anyway.  The fact that you have no freedom in solving the puzzles or killing victims in different ways is not a bad thing on its own, although that would have made the game a lot more interesting to play. The problem is that the linear puzzles put in the game are boring, and like many adventure point and clicks they suffer from not making a whole lot of sense sometimes, or not being very intuitive at least, because the solutions are so specific, having to do with items scattered around a huge mansion you'll have trouble finding.   The mechanics of the game are also cluncky, and the controls suffer from the third person perspective - you play a short character, so sometimes to use items you'd have to go into weird camera angels, making it difficult to see the item you are trying to get to. Sometimes your character blocks the view of items you are searching in or controlling, and picking things up and moving them around and all the puzzles would have been easier to control in first person view.   All in all, the game is simply sub-par on almost every level or aspect of it, disappointing in many regards and only pleasantly surprising in plot and voice acting.

2678	1	a	Deadly Premonition is known for being the most polerizing Survival Horror game ever made.  That means people love it or hate it. I personally say this is my 2nd favourite game ever.  The plot goes like this a, girl called Anna has been murdered in the small town of Greenvale and hung to a tree, where 2 small boys called Isaac and Isaiah find her. So the F.B.I send Special Agent Francis York Morgan, to go solve the murder.  So pretty much it is Twin Peeks.   Gameplay and graphics are terrible but, you don't play this for that, you play this for the Fantastic story and characters and dumb dialogue.  Francis York Morgan is probably my favourite video game character ever, next to Raziel of Soul Reaver.  He is Smug and a â¥â¥â¥â¥ to other characters at first. He also talks to himself referring the person he is supposedly talking to as 'Zach' But I will not spoil how that ends. York is a very likeable character, and he has some of the bizarre dialogue you'll probably ever hear.  Speaking of bizarre, the entire game is strange. I can't really explain how. You just have to play it or watch videos on it.   The gameplay goes from linear missions, to Free-roam. The Town of Greenvale is pretty big but navigation is terrible and the map is next to useless.  You probably will learn your way around the town.  Or you can do a side quest that gives you Fast Travel, but by using fast travel you're missing out on the dialogue York says while driving.  While you're driving around York talks to Zach about...Movies. It comes right the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of nowhere and it's brilliant.   In the Linear missions the game goes all Survival horror on you! 'The game is not scary at all. It is more funny than scary.'  The enemyâs you fight 'all 1 of them' are called Mysterious Shadows.  They look like zombies with clown make up on.  And they make stupid noises when they die.  The shooting works but it wonât blow your mind or anything but it works. Melee weapons work decently.   The game's soundtrack is superb! The music sometimes goes from SUPER SERIOUS!!! To comedy relief.  It's baffling when it happens.  The game in general is 'unintentionally' funny.  The other characters like the sheriff George Woodman and Deputy Emily Wyatt are brilliant.  There is one character called Harry Stewart who wears a Gas mask and doesn't talk.  He has an assistant at all times called Michael Tillotson who talks in rhyme all the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing time.  There is, plenty of other characters too but this would be 5x longer than it already is.   Deadly Premonition as Jim Sterling put it is a beautiful train wreck, so terrible so awful but yet, so beautiful you can't look away. I want everyone to at least try this gem once. You might end up loving it as much as I did. 10/10 Also I would love to thank my good friend Niall for showing me this masterpiece of a gem. Keep your chungus sexy you beast!
2237	1	a	I dont usually write reviews, but just wanted to say it runs perfectly fine on my rig, the only time i ever get any sort of slow down is right after I open the store page or capture a point. This doesnt effect the game play at all so it doesnt bother me. Just wanted to put my two cents in here because I want people to know it does run fine on some rigs without a bunch of glitches. Ive enjoyed the five hours I have put in so far, and plan on putting alot more time in. My recomendation would be to buy it, and if it runs fine on your rig great, if not return it. But its definitly worth giving it a shot.
2794	1	a	Though for some reason I get terrible frames in this game (not optimized still?), I can't not recommend this game to fans of old Sega Dreamcast openworld adventure/mystery games (Shenmue, Blue Stinger, etc.). The music along with the dialogue is GOLD, if you're into more surreal, awkward humor. This game has gotten me to watch Twin Peaks, which I had previously refused to do, it's that infectious. Deadly Premonition certainly isn't for everyone and needs a special kind of eye to appreciate everything it has going for it. 9/10
1421	1	a	Not bad game but the trading cards have horribly price.
2722	1	a	I'm only recommending this game is the story behind this game. It it solid mystery, and I will finish the game at some point. What I really don't like are the controls, interface, and gameplay as they are quite lacking (on PC that is.....)  6/10, only because of a good backstory.

1944	1	a	Its amazing how far this game has come since launch. Its also amazing how much of a shoddy mess this was when it launched. Luckily the latest pactch has finally fixed the major performance issues, and we are finally able to play the pretty decent Far Cry 3 clone that lies beneath.  If you loved Far Cry 3 but are sick of replaying it, I'd give this ago. Lighting looks amazing too, if you're into that sort of thing.
914	1	a	demon child. 10/10
1043	0	a	Rather then a horror game or a game that stresses freedom of choosing whom the character kills, this game is more of a puzzle game... Figuring out how to linearly kill another character whithout getting caught... Not what I expected.
793	1	a	Lucius is a game that puts you in control of a child, the child of Lucifer to be specific. Without spoiling the story, you are the antichrist, making sacrifices to Satan in fun, creative, and very gruesome ways.   *Gameplay*
2049	0	a	  I played the story for about 50 min. It took about 15 before they turn control over to you to do some fetch quests and then another 5 min of story before you even get a gun to shoot it. I woudn't recommend this game on its own merit. If you're a fan of the Far Cry series then there may be something here for you but if you were looking for a deep level of immersion maybe look elsewhere. 6/10

3036	1	a	Knytt Underground is a more evolved amped up edition of the classic Knytt gameplay. Playing the original Knytt felt like a sweet regular nintendo game with way better sound.  Knytt Underground feels like if the franchise just came to Super Nintendo as it significantly sets the bar higher than the previous game. Everything is improved and worth paying for.   Years ago, I played Knytt which was a free platformer game from some guy i never heard of. He or someone provided a level editor and pretty soon, I was playing dozens and dozens of fan mods (essentially the same game concept but with different locations, music, puzzles and enemies and some pretty infuriating gameplay mechanics)  What drew me into Knytt and kept me coming back was the great feeling of size and scope. The sound design was always brilliant. Wonderful ambient music (which is some of my favorite kind of music) no voice acting (good thing) , satisfying sounds of scuttling along, jumping, crawling up walls, splashing into water, ect. You feel like a little beetle bug just trying to get somewhere.   Generally Knytt games revolved around a very bare bones narrative story, just simply enforcing the idea you had to get somewhere. Sometimes the motive was silly, sometimes it was supposed to be serious.   Depending on which map you got, you might have a giant maze world full of keys you have to collect to advance, like a typical metroidvania, and/or was simply set up in a way that required abilities to be found and progress. Sometimes it was both.  never did the game hold your hand. It generally pointed you to go 'left' and that's all the instructions you usually got. Figure it out on your own.   Knytt Underground is all of this, still. But its better. the new gameplay mechanics immediately feel welcome and a great add on to an already winning formula !   The only criticism I have for Knytt Underground is the art style of the 'sprites' (as in, the characters who identify as sprites, little magical beings). I don't mean the pixelated sprite that represents a game character in a 2D pixelated game. In action, the sprites look fantastic and I wouldn't change a thing. however, the points where the game pauses for dialog with a NPC are where I have issues.   The original Knytt, if I recall correctly, didn't do this. Character's 1 line or so of dialog would simply display as you walked near them and the dialog disappeared when you got a certain distance away.   Now the dialog is initiated by pressing a button, which is fine ! No problem with this. The problem is the hideous enlarged profile portrait of a sprite when you are talking to it (or when your sprite character is talking). Suddenly all that beautiful art style you were enjoying gets shattered by the worst looking MS PAINT quality blotches of color I've ever seen in a game. (ok, i've probably seen worse but the point is these are completely out of place). I wish they either re-did these to look smaller (as the larger presentation is what reveals how crappy they look) or simply use their head instead of the whole body. Because they simply look awful. I do not like.   Other than that, I pretty much covered it all ! Watch some gameplay vids of the original Knytt to see what i'm talking about.  A great experience. I recommend.
990	1	a	I just spent the last 6 hours playing through this insane game - and I loved every minute of it!   As the classic narrative goes (closest resemblance here is Rosemary's Baby), Satan is invoked to claim a child as his offspring - that would be our protagonist Lucius. He then continues to teach the boy in the sick ways of doing his bidding - the player takes over this role then. There is a total of 18 chapters and each contains a mission to creatively murder one or several people in a way that pleases his Dark Lordship, all while avoiding any suspicion and planting false clues and evidence.   Technically this game is well done. The graphics will certainly not win any prices, especially the textures of the surroundings, but on the other hand, the effects look good and the characters show a variety of body language, facial expressions and are lip-synced. The gamneplay/controls and what little menu (inventory) you need are smooth and fine as they are. I especially liked the audio: a variety of atmospheric music (and the annoying music on the tape that you will sooner or later hand to the driver - which is meant to be that way :D ) and good voice actors.  Overall, this game is unique: it's sadistic, dark and twisted, sometimes even humorous (depends on your kind of humor of course ;) ). The kill sequences, that crown your triumph at the end of each chapter, are a bizarre and wonderfully gruesome mix of sensation and childlike wonder - in the way children sometimes enjoy litting ants on fire and the like. An always fascinating and gripping ride from start to finish. 85% in my book.

0	1	a	Now here is a MOBA game that never got the credit it deserved. Demigod popped on my radar a few years back but when it launched there were several server issues that hindered the initial launch. I still praise this game because when the dust settled and the mud slinging stopped it turned out to be a pretty little gem.   Demigod borrows interesting ideas from RTS games and implements that into MOBA gameplay. Capturing points, upgrading troops, towers and buildings are just a few of these mechanics and I welcome them as a different way of looking at how MOBA games could add layers of gameplay. Unfortunately there was nothing else added to the game with the exception of two extra demigods. Each demigod is unique and you still level up, gain gold, upgrade skills and buy items.  I've had some incredible matches on Demigod when the community remained active and it is something I always go back to with a few friends for bot matches. The AI matches can get incredibly hectic on the higher difficulties with Demigod offering a variety of maps. You can pick up Demigod now for $10 but I've seen it for around $5 on the sales.

1530	0	a	I have to say.. due to all the bugs that exist within the game. 1 would think this is in beta state.. i say beta because it isnt terrible but there are alot. The lack of multiplayer base for this game literally within the first week of release tells me that this game will end up just like starwars battlefront. Flopped... an example is today.. sunday at 5 pm eastern.. i went looking for games and didnt find a single 1.. tells ya something about the future state of this game in general. story is ok but nothing to speak of. truthfully listening to the leaders of the resistance give talks to the resistance in single player was really eh. didnt feel really all that hardcore to resist haha.. some would say the story itself is short.. maybe not as short as the first game.. but short enough that i hammered threw it in a few hours.. so truthfully i went in really wanting to love this game and deep silver pre-released it to early.. really half did everything in the game.. and truthfully the hype everyone sees when watching the trailer.. the game didnt live up to. its a shame really as iv invested to many hours to request a refund and am stuck with the game. on the plus.. i wont have to spend any more money on dlcs/expensions as deepsilver kinda lost my business. really liked the company till now and always supported their games. shame but oh well.. sorry for any errors as i am writing this really quick before heading out the door. my advice is if you aint sure , give it a go as you may enjoy it but i personally wasnt impressed. games worth maybe 30 bucks at best at its current state. and truely feel it needs a way better story line.. but to each their own.

363	1	a	You are Lucius, you are the anti christ, you are death.  Play as a small quiet child named Lucius, born to a rich senator and a loving mother. You live in a large mansion, with maids and butlers that make your life easier.. in different ways than intended.  Normally maids and people of service are there to clean or fix, or even get you things when you are too lazy to grab them yourself. Not for Lucius, these servants are souls waiting to be reaped for the hellfire home you call hell.  But of course you are just a child with weak powers, you can not just reveal yourself, that would mean certain death and prolong the rebirth. No, you will do this silently and as if accidents have befallen your estate. What better way to absorb the poor souls of innocent men and woman then by 'accidently' killing them?  The gameplay isnt very linear sometimes, so that can be frustrating for some people, me included. I found myself looking at guides to find certain items or to find out where I need to go next. The mansion you are living in is also massive and complicated at first, really confusing you more than needed.   The deaths are fun, giving a sense of accomplishment when you kill someone.   You can break stuff, mind control people, erase their minds, use your mind to move objects and burn people alive.   About 5 hours of gameplay if you play it to finish, not including achievements or general exploration.   I'd say give it a shot, and if it gets too complicated or annoying just pull up a guide from the steam overlay or on your phone for ease of access.  Personal Rating: 3.5/5

2812	1	a	Deadly Premonition is one of the strangest games I have played. It has terrible graphics, a story largely ripped straight from Twin Peaks, combat that is so easy it feels tacked on, bad driving controls, and terrible sound design among other things. In the end though I enjoyed it enough to finish the game with all the side missions completed and I even got the 65th trading card. It isn't by any means a good game, but something about it just makes it fun. This is very much a video game equivalent of a cult film. Anyone who enjoys the sound of that should give the game a try.

3063	1	a	It feels somewhat like a free roam Oddworld game, with unbelievable amount of secrets scattered all across the huge map; if the story seems boring for someone- he can skip first 2 short chapters and head to the chapter three, with the map that feels just overwelming in size as you explore it; I can wander for hours, use characters abilities to reach diffirent places, while still experiencing that quite fun feeling that with enough skill and time- you can access just any place you want, you explore as you like, listening to chilling music with backgrounds that only add to the sleepy and mysterious atmosphere.  One who finds the plot interesting may also face handful of diffirent creatures, each with their own stories and/or optional tasks that may make traveling through the world easier. I would also note the great fairy companion Cilia, her intelligence and cynicism really brought a few smiles for me.  If you like slower platforming games and exploration, pick it up, it can come with some pretty big discounts during sales, there should be a demo somewhere on the internet, not much of a free roam but shows some of the gameplay to test.  Edit: Actually I think it's one of my favourite games ever, while Knytt Stories are endless, Underground is huge and complete, and I'm happy to have 100% completed it. If Nifflas decides to make the same type of game, but expand it to the point where I could zoom and scroll through the map, and it would stretch so far that it would require me to plan entire travels, because of how 'open-world-rpgy' long they would take- then that's the game that I could take on a deserted island. It's just that entrancing to play it for me.

It's not your Triple-A title with a rich plot and surprisingly innovative gameplay but I don't think that it intends to be that. If you want to let off steam, this is it. Kinda like Nation Red, only in a car.  Quality is also very good, visually and technically. Oh, and good controller support; playing it with a Xbox 360 controller.  One of the few games I like to get back to now and then and still enjoy it. Recommended.

1535	1	a	  Homefront TR is a surprisingly fun game! After all the bad reviews I expected a lame, buggy, and broken game. What I got was a competent, interesting, and well-made game. The environments are well laid out and visually interesting, the main story moves at a nice pace, all the grindy side content is avoidable, and the shooting and stealth mechanics are fine.  Clearly you could play better games like Wolfenstein or Doom or Deus Ex, but Homefront TR is actually a fun game, worth picking up when it's on sale.  Disclosure: I played this during the free weekend, and only got about half-way through. I'll buy it when the price goes down further.

695	0	a	Lucius starts out promising, but completely fails to deliver any interesting gameplay. The entire game feels like a tutorial, holding your hand and slowly introducing new concepts on the way. Every 'puzzle' is either incredibly obvious or makes no sense, but is either way handed to you. The various powers you are given are only useful in very specific situations and sometimes plain don't work since the puzzle does not call for them. All in all, highly disappointing from something so promising.

2165	1	a	This game is made out to be a terrible and worthless game. I do agree, the graphics and gameplay could be better but the story and atmosphere is excellent! This game is totally worth purchasing, although do not buy if you have Windows 8/8.1! The game will not work unless you have Windows 10. I recommend this game to a casual to moderate gamer. It is fun to play when you have some free-time or on the weekend. PLEASE IGNORE ALL OF THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS, most of them contain stupid and irrelevant information. This game does have its faults but overall is great!

2455	1	a	I cant help thinking how much effort developers put into this game, you can write a full book with that much diaologue. Artwork is amazing especially in churches. You can feel the despair of dark times and end of the world theme. The combat is decent. Besides good amount of spells, overall combat system is not the best. The story is very well written, characters are unique and interesting. Unique and well written music that makes you feel the game atmosphre   Overall 7/10

2203	1	a	I love this game, now true I do wish there was a little more to do in it. But in the long run I enjoy the game play.  P.S I don't know where people are getting that it doesn't run well because I have mine on high and there are no problems, it sounds more like people just don't have the right computer setup. Remember a big beautiful graphics card does not mean you have what you need to run the game.

871	1	a	(Spoiler Alerts) Ok so the game is fun but there are some huge freaking problems. My main one being: THAT CHAPTER 05B IS BROKEN! There you are, awake at night to get rat poison, and on your way to get it, your mom wakes up and you have to hide. Thats reasonable right? Except that once you go out of hiding when she walks downstairs, you can still somehow get spotted by her through the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ FLOOR! Then once you get past that, you probably won't be beating that chapter, because you ave to break a light to distract a detective. You can break it and he walks into the darkness to see if someones there, so you should be able to enter the room, right? Nope, because the detective will turn and see you as soon as you make it within 2 feet of the door and SPOT YOU INSTANTLY!!! FIX THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥!!! Other than that though, from what I've payed so far cuz I still can't beat chapter 05b, its fun and I reccomend it.

1462	1	a	I don't know why all the hate but to me this game is amazing. It has everything that I wanted.   First, a lot of people complaining about bad performance. I have a gtx980ti and I run everything maxed at 90-70 FPS. It drops to 57-54 there and there sometimes but nothing really bad. So to me the game is running smoothly and well.   The engine is amazing. The graphics, the animations, the rain, the lighting and the whole atmosphere look very nice. Oh and the cutscenes. They are beautiful, movie like, but not overdone, yet interesting to watch. Actually, this is one of the few games that got me really interested into them and not willing to skip.  The world doesn't feel empty. There is always something to loot, a secret to find or a piece of land to claim. You can always pick what you want to do next - a main mission, a small mission from the mission board or maybe conquest a stronghold or a sniper nest. Also there are dynamic objectives that popup when you are close to them - i.e. somebody contacts you via a radio saying they are pinned and need help to defend their outpost. Or find that juicy loot crate. And you can always pick the approach. What is even better, there are lots of NPCs around which you can recruit to help you with a simple button click. You can have up to 5 I think and each NPC in the world carries its unique loadout. They will help you by shooting enemies, throwing frags, some even carry rocket launchers - all accessible from a get go.   Gun fights are satisfying. There are no crosshairs so you have to aim, compensate the recoil and distance. Weapons have tons of upgrades and each of them have what the game calls a conversion system - i.e. you can convert an assault rifle into a machine gun or a sticky mine gun, a crossbow to a flamethrower etc. in a blink of an eye during the combat or before and then switch back when you want the previous weapon version right on spot. Weapons also have lots of mods and upgrades.   Yes, you can say that it is just an another average AC or Far Cry clone but this game is a blast to play provided you have a good enough system. What's most important to me - the game atmosphere and events shown in the cutscenes and during other moments really made me immersed in the game world willing to help the rebels win the war.   10/10

2558	1	a	A superb game for people who enjoy Twin Peaks, murder mysteries and unique game design, not to mention charm, ambition, complexity and creativity that most modern games simply lack.   The PC port has some issues, but generally runs well for me and the issues it does have can be fixed with a few forum/google searches.  It's a unique game, one that any player who enjoys great games should experience.
2690	1	a	-Worth Playing- -I bought it in a Steambundle!-
1184	1	a	After completing this after around 10 hours, I guess I have a few things to say about this game.   The only game I have played that is similar to this would be Among The Sleep. You know, where you're playing as a child and you'd really hate to see the kid get mauled by anything. Only this is different. ATS is a cute little toddler with his teddy, Lucius is a little psychopath and he reminds me of that kid from Ju-On. There's an order where people get killed by this little prick. You'll also need specific items to kill them. Maybe you'd want to blast them all to buggery with this fancy fire power thing you get half-way into the game but NO, you can't because that power only comes back to you occasionally (for reasons beyond me), you have to fart around the entire manor getting items needed to orchestrate the perfect murder. Most of the time you'll be on Youtube watching walkthroughs because you've run around the manor so much you're getting motion sickness and WHERE IS THIS STUPID TRASH THIS WOMAN WANTS ME TO TAKE OUT.   Get it during a sale, like I did. I wouldn't pay its full price even though it's only Â£7 because I am tight like that.

580	0	a	Utterly Linear, laggy(bad performance), generally boring, AWKWARD controls, terrible graphics(them character models) and the worst of all, it is all built around the philosophy of the one-way path gameplay to goal. Nothing like the multitudes of choice you get in a good Hitman game, lets say which is exactly what this game should have been like(Hitman as a Devil child with Super-natural powers). Instead you get to click on objects and wade through the terrible designied interface system un till you connect the dots metaphorically with some object(s) which are pre-determined to then finally allow you to kill some sterotypical house dweller in some very sterotypical pre-determined ways. Note PRE-DETERMINED, this felt more like a puzzle game to me than some crazy/inventive sandbox killing fun as an Omen child clone.   It's not worth even an hour of your time. I personally stopped playing after 4 missions it was SO terrible and laborious to wade through, has the typical cheesy investigator is getting suspicous of supernatural happenings storyline to from [insert random devil child movie here]. Oh and the investigators name is MCGUFFIN... even the Developers think this game is a joke, clearly.  Lets hope Lucius 2 really delivers the Hitman-esque Omen game that many of us, including me want.

2656	1	a	Horey shet, this game is great.  First things first though, while 'directors cut' is slightly different from the original on the consoles, its a horrible PC port. Luckily theres a fix for most of the issues and if you disable steam overlay, you can play it, crash free prettymuch. Just dont alt+tab or do anything outside the game while playing.  I absolutely love this game, its very story/character focused and both of those two are just batshit insane in a very charming way. The characters are so much fun, the story is interesting and keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way. The gameplay however is clunky, weird and feels like some really old Japanese RPG's in many ways and shares the many gripes that Jap games in general have, which would be clumsy menus, unnecessary button prompts here and there ect, but oddly enough, it didnt bother me that much. Killing baddies is kind of funny, but the general atmosphere is great and quite spooky at times too.  All in all, I'd say that get this on some console if you want to play it without any issues from the start, or get this PC version and be prepared to fix its many issues. Its an amazing, crazy, weird, funny and extremely interesting.  I'd r8 it an 8/8 m8, no h8.
500	1	a	Lucius is a puzzle game where your goal is to assasinate people in order to please your father lucifer without being caught in the process, each time you make a sacrifice, you become more powerful on one of the different evil magic areas, telekinesis, mind control, mind erase and fireball, although fireball is only usable in very specific ocasions. The graphics are not bad at all, controls are ok to play with, sadly you can't use a gamepad. Some of the deaths in the game are very gruesome, sadly there's not enough graphics quality to back that up. For achievement hunters this is a easy game to get them all. I do recommend.

2995	1	a	I do love this game, the story is very engaging. I love the characters and they are also engaging to the point I actually remember even the not very important ones. Gameplay is more old school horror kinda like RE, It is rare that I love horror games to where u always have a time limit. But I also understand why and they do give u enough time to do things. For it's time even the graphics were pretty I was amazed. Now for some of the Negitives was... I kept playing with my controller,And some times during QTE like running my controller wouldn't work at all. I tried to get the patch but the site didn't seem like it was there any more. And some glitches in the game were terrible like whe I had to follow someone, And she disappered off the screen and I failed the mission cause of it. Or I would go in a room and it would be completely black and I would fail the mission cause I fell through the world. Quite a few times I had to completely restart a mission cause of it. Or I would have to close the game because my game slowed to a crawl and if I didn't then I couldn't shoot anything fast enough or the QTE would be terrible. O ther than that I do recommend giving this a game a try especially if u are big on old school horror.
1680	1	a	Looked good, had lots of fun fighting for the 'revolution'!. There were a few small bugs, but nothing that ruined the game or story, overall a lot of fun. I like how the game left a lot of it somewhat open, so you could do what you wanted, but still had a linear story line. Good fun! Thanks to the rough road the developers had to get this out, was worth it.
1005	1	a	bought it just for intrest but man did it mess me up mentally but im not gunna let my taste make a bad review if you like the evil puzzle games then this game is for you just becareful when you play at night i had to delete this game cause of how bad i felt lmao 'its just a game does no justice...

Fantastic game with some low-budget development that constantly shows, but has an amazing plot. The characters and plot alone justify this purchase despite that you  will  have to use DPfix to get the most of this experience.  That is all.  Buy it, you casual scum.

Fair value, too, and honestly the only time I've ever wanted a game that Steam gave me a coupon for! I have two complaints, however: the controls take a bit to get used to, and those who aren't familiar with any sort of top down driving game may have trouble adapting to them, and second, the voice acting is just an abomination. I digress, as this game is very fun and can provide many hours of gameplay and many millions of SLAUGHTER FODDER! :D

1269	1	a	Ive finished the main story now. Almost a good game... Some fun, but the Cut Scenes are the MOST ANNOYING I have EVER seen. You cant skip them, even when repeating a mission. I cant believe that they would put such a stupid restriction on the game (and from what I have heard, they WILL NOT change it, despite many complaints). They are TERRIBLE. The voice acting is poor (it comes across as cheesy / fun the first time or two), and the cut scenes ruin the pace of the game. Not to mention the stupid difficulty changes in each mission. And Im SICK AND TIRED of every â¥â¥â¥â¥ing mission being timed in one way or another. Create a game that is potentially fun, then not allow you to actually enjoy it (except in other game modes maybe). Would have gotten an 8/10, but I have to give it a 6... it does its best to ruin the long term (replayable) enjoyment of the game.
1525	0	a	To be completely honest, this game isn't up to par with the original game. Sure, it looks nice, and the freeplay environment is cool, but somehow, they managed to make the gunplay worse than the original game's. Converting weapons on the fly is cool and everything, but realisticly, it's too fast and the changes that are made are sometimes quite rediculous. Also some conversions are just â¥â¥â¥â¥. Convert your sniper rifle into a firework cannon? Nope, do not do that. You'll have better luck with a grenade or you know, an actual rocket launcher. The online game is pretty just the missions from singleplayer(sure they're different missions, but they play out the same. No freeplay online, its just mission after mission and theres really not that many missions to play. Also, the online is dead already, so don't expect to actually get to play online if that â¥â¥â¥â¥ Bottom line, I bought the game to see if it was really as â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ as everyone said it was. I can confirm it's pretty bad, but probably not quite as bad as everyone else says. Buy this game if you want to play another Far Cry esque game and would like it in some 'The United States has been invaded and you, the most patriotic of patriots would rather die than let those â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Koreans win' kind of perspective. 8/10 Concept wise, 3/10 gameplay wise, 0/10 multiplayer, and 1/10 for optimsation and polish. Overall, I'd say its about a 3.5/10

It takes a while to get going but this is a brilliant game worthy of your time, with memorable characters, great music and a storyline straight out of Twin Peaks.
1113	1	a	Got this on sale, never finished the game, but I can just barely recommend this. It's good to play for awhile in the beginning, but after a few murders it starts to get a bit repetitive. I quit after the reporter guy in the basement. The house is also extremely easy to get lost in, especially since you have no minimap and have to open the map over and over to make sure you're going in the right direction.

1467	0	a	After finishing the game, I felt dissapointed. Not in the gameplay, but in the basic aspect of it. I loved the play style i chose, it was OP, but allowed for a challenge when i wanted it. I was a super fast stealth monster whose primary weapon was a knife and a crossbow. Many people complain about the stealth mechanic in the game being â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, and i can agree a bit. If you are caught, everyone know where you are, but, considering its a super advanced army with self driving tanks, I would not be surprised. There were more stealth options than people think, including if you kill an enemy quick enough, they can't call reinforcements. Made use of that real well.  But....  There is one thing i hated, absolutely hated. It was so bad that I have to give the game a thumbs down. The story, As you started feeling emersed in the game, the story comes by and tears you away like a bandaid held on with super glue. like, WTF happened to the original mission!    Your original mission is to find some dude who was a huge asset to the resistance. Halfway through the story, you forget he exists and you never hear from him again.   And the ending was so anti climactic and made no sense. spoilers ahead.   You are so OP that you end up going through the final mission barely getting damage, then out of nowhere, without any context as how it happened, you are on your death bed, limping at 0.2 MPH and only have a pistol. Where the â¥â¥â¥â¥ is my SMG, my battle rifle, my mine launcher. did they just disappear?!? And WHY THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ DOES THE â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ COMMIT SUICIDE I COULD HAVE TAKEN OUT THE GOLIATH WITH 2 â¥â¥â¥â¥ING MINES!   I can't understand it. While playing the game you are a god who runs up to enemies and stabs the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of them while blasting heads off with ease. then all of a sudden you are stopped by a grunt who somehow sneaks up on you and slaps you in the face.  Here is another problem. People mix up open world and sandbox. Open world means you have access to the entire world, but it can still be controlled by the story. Sandbox means no rules. Fallout 4 is a good example. You dont even need to do the missions, you can go and destroy the entire wasteland right out of the vault.  On the topic of open. The story is linear as â¥â¥â¥â¥. You have no control as to what happens. The only time you have the option to choose is when you decide to either kill, or spare a double agent. and you know what, your decision DOES JACK â¥â¥â¥â¥! IT DOES NOT DO ANYTHING!!! HELL YOU ARENT EVEN SENT AN EMAIL OR TEXT SAYING YOU SHOULDA LEFT HIM ALIVE OR KILL HIM! LIKE NO INTERACTION TO THE DECISION AT ALL! If you are going to give the option to choose, that option HAD BETTER HAVE A RIPPLE EFFECT!  At this current point in time, don't waste your money on the game. If there is an update or even a DLC that fixes these issues and helps close holes in the story, then it may be worth the buy.

2003	1	a	Pro's- I was really grabbed in the beginning by the story about a revolution, it has very good characters and the voice actors really make the characters feel real! No repetitive main missions, every new main mission is a new experience. I never got bored with the main missions. Great animations including finishers, reloading guns, and interactions with other NPCs. Not a COD cliche story and action like the first Homefront. Has over 30 hours of main story gameplay.  Con's- Graphics can be better because they are working with the Cryengine. The permocrence needs a lot of work I have a AMD FX 8350 and a GTX 970 and I can't play above low so wait for performance patches. There are MANY glitches and the AI is really bad very easy compat on easy I would recommend going Normal or Hard difficulty. The multiplayer is a full rip of any other â¥â¥â¥â¥ing shooter barely no guns, repetitive team deathmatch, choosing classes doesnt matter its who ever pulls the trigger first and bad connection issues.  6/10 It's ok

It's also got a lot of collectible content and events you may need multiple playthroughs to obtain. Whether that's a good or bad thing is up to how much you love the game.

1505	1	a	So this game has been getting many many bad reviews because of its 'terrible frame rate' and 'clunky gameplay' maybe its just my computer but this game has FANTASTIC gameplay!! it feels so good to just walk! and to run and climb and shoot. the gunplay is a bit sluggish but that is more because the game is going for a more realistic take on gunplay. its not like call of duty. its not my favorite type of gunplay mechanics but for what it is its fantastic. Not to mention the amazing graphics, story, and how gosh darn likable ALL of the characters are! the characters are all great! even people you just see on the street. they all feel so real! it really gives the entire game a different feel than most shooters! also the world is massive! it feels so open and free even when youre running through crowded alleyways. the weapon customazation is also really neat! you can see your character take apart your pistol and install parts to turn it into an SMG right before your eyes! it really interesting!! so overall i say this game is GREAT. maybe the framrate is actually pretty crappy for a normal computer, my computer is an absolute monster so...  well i freaking love this game. id definatly suggest giving it a try especially now that steam will let you refund games! id honestly give this game a solid 8/10. its pretty much all i expected and i am quite pleased with my perchase.

316	1	a	Lucius was born on the June 6th, 1966 and he was just a regular boy until his 6th birthday, when his true identity was revealed by his true father, Lucifer who instructed Lucius to orcastrate the deaths of the mansion's residents without anyone suspecting him, granting Lucius supernatural powers as he succeeds. The concept is interesting, the graphics and soundtrack are quite good, the gameplay is great and the story is intriguing. Despite all the controversy surrounding this game for obvious reasons, I still recommend it.
1588	1	a	Wish I had realized that the Steam Free Weekend was happening sooner because I really liked the story and the missions of this game. Although the game play was a bit laggy at times - even when I lowered the settings from what had automatically been selected, it had overall good mechanics and great graphics and decently smart AI. There were a few glitches that threw me outside the map when jumping a fence, but other than that, a very good experience.

2528	0	a	I normally don't write these little blurbs for games I've barely scratched the surface on, but this game is an exception. While I'm sure the game is incredibly rich and deep, there is a limit I have for presentation in the modern age. When the controls and flow are as good as they are on the classic standard-setters Baldur's Gate 1 and 2, there is no excuse for a game that plays as sloppy as this now. My apologies to the dev, but I uninstalled after one hour.

1891	0	a	One hour into the campaign and three hours into the multiplayer and I don't want to bother giving this game a better chance with what I've experienced so far. With a laughable open world, sub-par texturing, bad optimization, and animations that are like moving furniture; Homefront falls well below most anything Deep Silver had anything to do with.  I'm finding myself questioning why I've bothered giving the game a chance as much as I question the refund system that let my friend successfully refund this game, despite being as many hours into it as me, and myself not getting the refund.  Oh; and can we talk about what a laugh the multiplayer is? I understand Homefront is primarily a single player experience, but with how bad the multiplayer is; there was no point in even including it. It massively lacks any sort of content or progression. After the few hours I've played, I've already unlocked a majority of the weapons and a good chunk of any items to affect combat. The talent trees lack depth and the only real fun thing to pick up are cosmetic items; which can hardly hold a dry multiplayer scene with a couple maps down. If I wanted to collect cosmetic rewards all day, I'll at least do it in a more captivating and rewarding gaming experience like Overwatch.

2346	0	a	First let me give you a little background on my gaming so you dont think this is coming from some schmuck! I have been a gamer for over 35 years starting with Atari and the commodore 64. I have been playing FPS since the original call of duty. So here goes! The designers and producers of this game are either drunk or so far out of touch with what gamers are looking for in FPS that they should 1) stop producing games 2) refund the purchase price to everyone who purchased this game as a noob so they dont think this is what FPS should be and 3) apologize for ruining the Homefront title which was a great FPS game. This game is terrible from the story line to the gameplay. This is the worst multiplayer game I have ever encountered. To call this multiplayer or even co-op is a joke. My advise to anyone looking to purchase a good FPS is to buy anything other than this fiasco of a game. Developers and producers as well as graphic design should all be embarssed for putting out such a monstrosity of a game. Steam should pull they game so they are not associated with such garbage.

1573	0	a	   My experience with this game in a nutshell.  [i.imgur.com]   Seriously though, let me elaborate a bit. Everything starts with this dramatic and unbelievable story where North Korea sells tech to the US, and once they're the most trusted brand, they exploit a global backdoor to takeover the government. Whatever, I just wanna be a punk and kill soldiers. Anarchy forever, right?  Well, let's just say that the 'resistance' you're a part of it's actually a full blown military operation and everybody is a soldier... they just dress like punks because it looks cool, but they're not mere rebels. Everything is meticulously calculated and coordinated, they have high end tech, bases, recon squads, arsenals, tactical strategy planning... bloody hell, the only thing missing is having my fellow 'rebels' using the NATO alphabet for comms.  There is absolutely no sense of chaos and I don't feel like a rebel at all.    There's a HEAVY amount of handholding  (luckily you can disable most of it). NPCs talking through voice comms all the time, blabbering meaningless stuff that is supposed to make you feel tacticool, only reinforcing what I stated in the previous paragraph. I was quickly introduced to a bunch of mechanics (smartphone, weapon upgrading, camera, maps, etc.) and the only thing going through my head was 'is this really necessary? Why can't they just throw me into the action? Why don't they stop talking and stating the obvious? Why can't they let me figure things out by myself?'. It's so bad I got achievements for doing literally nothing... I went through a hole in the wall, boom, achievement. I'm not exaggerating.  AI is astoundingly dumb. Right after I got my first weapon, I went into the first underground area and killed everybody (I didn't know they were my allies).  The game will try to stop you by not letting you aim at the NPC's but you can kill them anyway ... you can even throw molotovs at them and THEY WON'T REACT AT ALL LMAO. I'd expect them to charge against me or at least run for their lives... nope, they just stand there and say their generic idle voicelines while you kill them. What happens if you throw a molotov towards an essential NPC? They burn and flap their arms and magically stop burning after a few secs; reach them and they'll talk to you like nothing happened.  Play on hard difficulty, disable the HUD clutter - doesn't matter,  game is ez af . Walk the streets, see a hot blondie, recruit her, headshot a NK guard from a long distance and no alarms will be rung. Enter a random building, see more snipars, patiently walk up the stairs and annihilate them at point-blank range, repeat a couple of times, BOOM, YOU WON, NEW BASE LIBERATED, PLAYER YOU'RE SUCH A WINNER AND HARDCORE SOLD--I MEAN REBEL, SINGLE-HANDEDLY WINNING THE W--REBELLION, JUST WOW.  The whole game is a giant scripted event that reeks of Call of Duty.   I wanted to take advantage of the free weekend and basically finish it for free, but it didn't hold my attention. Sound design is good, atmosphere is great, it's demanding enough to tax my rig... but it's casual garbage. Waste of 40GB.  Edit. it also crashes all the time.

270	1	a	It is so twisted :')  Prepare to see a lot of messed up scripted deaths, and a lot of â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up things like naked maids. Chodes and a perverted kid. All the reason to buy it :)
2373	1	a	  Not a bad FPS and while I dont intend on buying it after the free weekend, I would recommend it if it stays in the 20 dollar price range as there seems to be plenty of content in the base game.  Gameplay-wise, it starts off a bit chaotic after the overly long opening scene with tons of radio chatter and calls for help lighting up the HUD so much, I would suggest disabling most of the prompts for not only immersion but also an enjoyable less intrusive experience.  The game looks great and there is no doubt an improvement from the 1st title and it also plays very smoothly on modest hardware so you should be able to find your system sweet spot with a tweak here and there.

1627	1	a	Decent shooter, even though mobs disappearing out of 'nothing' gets kinda ... annoying.  Lots of ubistuff to do around the map.   The game world is decently 'littered' to resemble a post-Trump US. And even though we call them Norks we all know the bad guys are really China.   The hacking minigame really require a controller.  Not really happy about having to download and fill my SSD with 8GB of spoken 'crap' for language settings I would _never_ enable. That is around 13% of the total footprint of the game, so it is quite a lot.  
1179	0	a	I bought this and Lucius II in a bundle (I haven't played Lucius II yet) for like $1.75 or something.  For the price, I guess it's been okay?  It feels really empty, poorly explained, the video and audio aren't synced at all, and it just seems like the game is trying to keep you busy with simple tasks over and over.  It's like a poorly made Hitman clone, but with only one way to kill each person.  Rating: 2.3 / 10

5588	1	a	 Early Access Review
1409	1	a	The camera is a bit dizzying at times and the controls take some getting used to, but the graphics are great and the arcade gameplay is bang on.   It took me two years to figure out that since the game requires you to manually select your video card model from a drop down list in order to wok, upgrading or changing your card after you've installed the game will cause it to break. I manually selected my actual graphics card, and voila, after two years the game finally works. Nobody got back to me and the forums came up dry on this issue. Gave it a bad review at the time because of this.
1189	1	a	Lucius is a very fun game. The story is very fun and it can be very chalenging at times. I am not one to like puzzle games but I found my self really enjoying this one. It is a great mix between a horror game and a puzzle game. Overall, I would give this game a 8/10 and I would recomend it.
1804	1	a	I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing love this game, it is mainly about territory which is so fun and that you have to hide and be stealthy about it just makes it even more exhilarating
1681	1	a	I can honestly say that this game was actually really good. I played this game much later than most so I didn't experience any performance issues solid 60 fps on high all the way through. Now to the gameplay the guns in this felt really good and I loved the way you could customize the guns from the weapon wheel. In the beginning I would die quickly as I would just run in without a plan and I was slaughtered almost immediately, I do reconmmend to plan ahead such as marking enemys with your camera like the Far Cry games. I really got into the story it felt like you really fighting for something rather than mindlessly killing enemys. The two story add-ons are about 40 mins long but a big single player expansion is set to come out in sometimes this spring.  Great Game  Its a freaking steal at this price \0/

1827	1	a	Obviously could run better but I had no issues keeping between 80-120 fps so far, and the side missions are quite varried and interesting to evolve your play style and movement before advancing to the next stages of the campaign. For what the game went through to get released and me getting it for thirty some dollars, its worth picking up for a good single player. Merica.

212	0	a	  this game is very fun I got it from a giveaway on alienware arena not really expecting not to like it but so far I am really enjoying myself. but i dont really think it is a complete game and should still be in early access because there is just not enough features and things to do I really think this game has potential but needs more work done on it and more to do in the game so unless more things get added to the game i cannot reccomend the game for the price there selling it for. but definetly worth free from that giveaway. The moment they fix the bugs, properly optimize it and add the content needed to be a full game I will easily give it a thumbs up but till then I would hold off on buying it because there is no guantee they will add what is needed into the game.   Accidently Reviewed
2906	1	a	CAUTIOUS RECOMMENDATION: In its current state, I can't recommend DP to anyone but the old school PC gamers that don't mind getting their hands dirty with tweaks and fixes to keep it stable, let alone looking adequate. If you don't know what an .ini file is, stay away. Even then, a quality experience is far from assured.  Aside from the abundant technical problems, everything that could be called gameplay is clunky and monotonous. It's absent for most of the game, but the ending ramps it up a lot, which quickly feels like a chore to complete.  That said, the characters and story are worth the trouble for those with the requisite patience.
2423	1	a	I played this game during the FREE WEEKEND on steam.  Now the review. I went into this game excited as I've been watching this game ever since it was announced but was saddened by all the negative reviews. When there was a free weekend I was stoked and tried it out.  First off the graphics are very detailed and the lighting effects are amazing. Just the general atmoshpere is really immersive as you feel like you are living within an occupied city. The story seems a bit far fetched but hey its still a good game.  Secondly I will say that from the time I played it I realise why people were mad about the game as you do need a beefy computer in order to run it but they have released patches to make the game run smoother but since I do not have the game yet I do not know how big of a change this has had. Luckily my computer is beefy and ran the game very well.  So overall I enjoyed it but do admit the game was unoptimized at the time and a slightly beefy computer was required for this game. Once I buy the game I'll update my review to give a more complete review of it.
2317	1	a	Leave all the hatered behind the only flaw with this game is that it is not well optimised for anything nor pc nor ps4 but leaving that behind this is a all new game with new kind of vibe to it which we dont get in fps now a days the main campaign is good and the stealth and the open world element gives it a whole new touch and the gun play is too good although i get 30-40 fps it bothers me sometimes but if the patches can optimize the game then this could be one outstanding shooter. go ahead try it if you are into shooters and have a decent pc.
3083	0	a	Pretty backgrounds, terrible animations and simple gameplay. That's what Knytt Underground is all about. As far as I can tell, at least. Thank God I got this game in a bundle because it simply isn't worth â¬9. It's cute, in a way, but running around collecting useless stuff for NPCs so that I can enter new areas feels like a chore. Other games manage to pull it off in a way that it somehow can still be enjoyed. I'm sorry to say that Knytt just isn't one of those games. I'm not saying you should avoid it, but at least wait for a sale before getting this.  [Rating: 69/100]

320	0	a	Even though I got this at a 90% discount ($1.99), I was still left with a bad taste in my mouth, and wouldn't recommend it even at that price.  There's so much potential here, but the whole experience was messed up by frequent bugs and poor design choices. I'm normally very forgiving of bugs in games, but so many of these seemed like easy fixes that I felt like the product was rushed or lazily made.  The theme and enviornments are fun, as are the sidequests, but there are odd floating objects, crashes to desktop, and puzzle/action sequences that are extremely unguided and frustrating. Some puzzles are so counter-intuitive that you will either need to look up a guide or try to brute-force through a puzzle by 'pixelhunting' for the item you need to interact with. Probably half my playtime was spent being stuck, and when I finally found the answer it wasn't one of those 'DUH' moments, but rather 'that wasn't clear at all!'. The end sequence is so frustrating that I had absolutely no satisfaction from beating it, and was glad it was over.  A little more bugfixing and polish would have gone a LONG way here.  Can I get my $2 back?  Also, the acheivements are terrible! 40 hours playing this? Yeah right!
1723	0	a	I enjoyed the first homefront game quite a bit, although linear and feeling very outdated even upon release. I really wanted to try the second one. The reviews and outrage about the bugs, and constant glitches kept me away. After seeing the game on sale twice within two months I decided to give it a go for the heck of it.  I was very...disappointed. Even on max setting the game seemed to run ok, just up until you actually got to roam around. Within the first hour I ran across the same character models over...and over. People talking in the streets sunk into the ground up to their knees and popped back up, enemies would take one shot at me, then put away their weapon and walk away letting me just walk up to them and stab them. A sniper had a light on me for 6 minutes and never took a shot, allowing me to walk up to the second floor and stabing them without them even turning around. Your own people would suddenly veer off and get stuck on something or another, and run in place forever. So....in essence the AI is completely screwed up. For being an oocupied city, it was quite void of life. Two kpa walking around, though when you took an area suddenly 10 resistance people popped up, some stood still, some ran off to get stuck on objects. I kept sighing as the hour I played was painful.   I'm told there had been patches done and the game had been more stable, and many glicthes/bugs fixed. So I can't imagine what this game was like before that. Honestly, and dlc being released? The game is still a mess of bugs. I've seen early alpha games run smoother than this. 5 months after release, and it feels like a disaster. I'm not sure any free weekend, or sale will salvage this which is a shame. I love the concept, I love the idea of it all and was always a huge Red Dawn fan....old one not the newest one...  I really wanted to like this and intended on keeping it no matter what, hoping it would get better but after an hour of seeing people getting stuck on obstacles, enemies ignoring me as I walked up to them and shot them to pieces...I couldn't force myself to continue. What a mess....

1831	0	a	The missions are not randomized. The gunplay is not awesome. The coop works better than the campaign but there are very few missions and its get to point. defend horde, move to next point, defend horde. The graphics and the sound work are great. The game has a ton of work to be done on optimization as 90% of the users cant play it on pc on max settings on PC's that should be able to blow the game out of the water. A streamer who runs 3 Titan X's was getting 19 fps.  The Coop is still the best part of the game. It is very similar to the Dragon Age Inquisition Multiplayer where you go on a mission. Do the SAME mission each time you play it. Get xp and reward. Use your earned money to buy crates that give you weapons, attachments, boosters, gear, and cosmetics.   The campaign is trying to be 10 different games at once that don't blend all that well together. The driving part of the game is vomit inducing. The gunplay itself is pretty bad. It feels overly clunky and it doesnt flow well at all.   On easy the mobs will fill you with bullets at times and not hurt you at all. Then the same person shooting at you will 2 shot you. It is extremely inconsistent and infuriating. Badly designed.   Chances are if a person is claiming the game is great they either have bad taste, or are a hipster and like going against the grain.   I will have a full review at a later date for this game on  www.TheDrastikMeasure.com  but at this time the game is soooo bad I can't play it in it's current state.   Devs have to know the game was bad right? What is the thought process of releasing the game anyway ? The devs of the game even knew it was bad because in the credits they apologize for it and comment on it's troubled development. Was Deep Silver not willing to shell out more funding to help fix the title? Instead hey they IP will sell itself, lets rob our community ? I would love to know the thought process and inner workings of this game, the publisher and developer relationship.

1884	0	a	Homefront has all the right ideas, a story, large open world, different mechanics it all seems good. However the execution of these ideas leads to one of the worst games ive play while having the ideas I love. Its story falls short on importance, its open world suffers from buggy gameplay with far to few weapons and equipment. The A.I are a joke, friends cant hit anything and enemies kill you with no real notification that you are being shot. It reall is a shame considering how cool the games ideas are. Taking back a city from occupying DRNK forces block by block. With all these issues the multiplayer also has some great ideas, of outfitting a soldier and upgrading their gear and equipment how you see fit. With a backstory that acts like a perk, i can understand the direction. Again its poor execution, long load times, limited amounts of missions, and barely anyone to play with. Good try Deepsilver good try.

2471	0	a	The atmosphere of the game is great but, I feel the rest wasn't executed very well. The writing definitely captured some of the justice, heretic, interrogation theme but, ultimately wasn't very engaging to me.  The gameplay gets a bit repetitive, especially if you have to make multiple trips in certain areas due to equipment breaking or running out of potions. It seems a bit overkill if you have to bring 3 sets of weapons and 2 full pages of inventory filled with potions into one dungeon and you still have to make a 5 minute trip back out to resupply.  Those things said, I only played as a paladin and restarted twice to make stat adjustments. I never made it past the first act as well. I was about to write the review a while ago but, I decided to try to give it some more time. After a few more hours I still didn't make it out of act 1 and it was not worth it to push myself through this game.  All in all it's good for a few hours of mediocre entertainment at ~$2.00 but, I don't think it's worth your time.

1581	1	a	Great game. I dont believe it should be getting as much hate as it is. Never once crashed for me, no bugs, runned smooth and the entire idea of the game was just really neat and interesting. I enjoy every bit of it and Had a good time blowing the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of the KPA and starting the crowds of people to get all wild. There is some downsides though, I never felt SUPER attached to the campaign or story for example when a big character would die Id just be like,' welp â¥â¥â¥â¥.' It wasent like gears of war, red faction, arma 3, and bunch of more attached feeling campaignes. Other then that I enjoyed it all and if your looking for a cool story, fun gameplay to burn time, then I recommend buying this. 8/10  10/10 would whatch guys face get bashed with hammer again 10/10 would whatch that guy who bashed the other guys face in get his face bashed in 10/10 would whatch that guy who bashed the guys face in who bashed the other guys face in get shot in the knee.

2060	1	a	Have to say this game has already given me some memorable moments.  After the prologue the first two times i found a bike i drove it like i have never driven any vehicle in a game, and proceded to nearly run over the koreans and my allies while barely missing buildings and vehicles. I don't use them anymore.  But honestly the game has enough flashy parts to keep you interested and the game has a nice difficulty so that i can't just grab the marksman rifle or assualt rifle and treat this like the coop missions in CSGO.   The characters are detailed, better than than that one game..... Division..... so you can easily like or hate people.  Honestly i was expecting something more like this from The Division.   My biggest gripe is that the campaign is not co-op, i enjoy even bad games if i can bring my friends with me, and this isn't bad.

Characters are dull, main character Brady doesn't speak and everyone around him speaks for Brady and also everything related to revolution is up to Brady, so no one is trying to do anything to save their country except Brady. Cryengine and fancy graphics won't make it better. Consistent and rich story is what makes games fun to play not just graphics + gameplay.

You have a shÃ¯tty ten 'characters' to pick from, and you'd expect that with a roster that tiny, the few that're available will all feel completely unique and incredibly well-made, polished to a mirror sheen and then some! But guess what? NOPE! The so-called 'characters' are all bland and uninteresting, and there's absolutely zero balance between them.  Hell, there's absolutely zero balance in the game PERIOD! Now, I haven't played it for a while, so I can't know for sure, but last time I DID play it worked like this: earn a focking rÃ«tardedly massive amount of gold, buy All-Father's Ring, win the game. Because buying a singular item REALLY should make so much difference to everything in the game that you LITERALLY become unstoppable, unkillable and automatically win. Honestly, I don't get why they wouldn't just make it so that whichever player gets that focking stupid amount of unspent gold 'earns' his/her team a victory auto-stupid-matically.  The game has so many glitches, balance issues and outrageously rÃ«tarded design errors that it's just plain unplayable. Considering also that DOTA2 is now available, I will personally voodoo-curse anyone BUYING this game instead of playing DOTA2 FOR FREE. 0.7/10

2884	1	a	If youâre going to measure Deadly Premonition using traditional gaming yardsticks like graphical fidelity, gameplay challenge, and overall polish, then this Directorâs Cut still comes up short of modern standards even with the fixes. Yet despite any obvious technical shortcomings, it succeeds on the strength of its story, its characters, and its countless WTF moments. It doesnât feature enough new content to interest existing fans, but if you want to find out which side of the love-it-or-hate-it divide you're on, nowâs the perfect time to play one of the most memorable and utterly insane survival-horror games ever made in its most accessible form.

738	1	a	Great concept, graphics for a game like this it's okay. You are Lucius, a little boy and a killer. It's like (Hitboy) ;) and movies like 'The Omen'  You can open every drawer and cabinet, turn on/off every light. You can unlock 5 specials like telekinesis. You have an inventory and you can combine stuff. People talk to you and if you listen you can get infos about your next kill. If you finishes a job you get a final sequence with your kill which is mostly very violently and brutal bloody. Not for kids... but with kids. XD   -Points for too lineary story. Every kill has only 1 solution. Find this solution is sometimes really hard. You have to check out the big house for every little piece you maybe need. Try everything and you will find your way.  Another -Point for the ending. 1st it was terrible hard, 2nd it was harder if you dont know what to do and 3rd, it was too short. Final Fight and immediatly Credits.  Price is ok and i was entertained. 7/10

1946	1	a	This game is nasty, the reviews are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Sometimes the AI gets stuck on corners, breaks immersion a bit, but this is still a nasty game.  Molon Labe.
1608	1	a	The game is great..though not the best. Just beat the game last night b/c I decided to take off work to play Homefront. Overall a lengthful game, but quite repetative. It's fun raiding areas and doing strikes...for the first few times, but that gets really old and annoying. Good things about the game are the upgradable guns. They have gears that allow to enhance your character(Brady) to take more damage or reload faster. A note though. This is not an rpg shooter, but I maybe or interested in these takes for fps games. Having a standard shooter story is very boring and does not have quite the like for me. Though this game is story focus and this game does not have PVP fights like battlefield or raindbow six. This game is somewhat comparable to the metro games series. The story is understandable. U.S falling into debt to North Korea. Now they are under their rules until the debt is payed off(surprised China didn't do that in reality). I did run into some bugs like flickering walls or buildings. Had some dumb AI's walking towards walls and sudden framedrops. This only happended early and part of the way to the end. Great game for one go, but there is no newgame+. So no second journeys for me. I'd recommend if you're willing to look past the bad comments and possibly wait for another sale. Got it during the 23.99 sale.

1605	1	a	  This is definately a step up from the first Homefront game. It reminds me of Red Faction: Guerilla, the Saboteur, and maybe a little GTA.   The world is open but manageable. The look and feel are spot on and the gun play is as good as any other current shooter. It came across as a little to predictable for me so don't expect much from the story. I was plesantly amused by the upgrades to the guns. Maybe all weapons should be so easily swapped out with parts to make other bigger weapons.   I initially loved the idea of hoping on a motorcycle until I tried it. Too much debri on the streets and using the keyboard to drive made the experience a hectic motorcross nightmare.   Claiming locations to free up the map was a bit too easy also. Simply activate the console, laptop, pressure valve and the area is yours. All the enemies vanish and your own troops take up residence.  It's a good run around game where you get to shoot at guys or drones for a bit. Not the best game ever and certainly stuff we have seen a time or two before, but much better than the original.
1759	1	a	I have to recommend this game if you enjoy a good shooter game with a decent story. If you are a fan of the first Homefront its a conflicted feeling to like this game though I have a huge BUT about the entire game. I hope that the single player missions that are coming out will address some of the issues I have with this game. I would also hope this is not the end to the Homefront series and that the developer is given a better directive on how to craft the story and give us a better open world.  I can't make my review based upon the first Homefront because it wouldn't be fair to this game. Which is why I recommend the game. However I will give my opinion.  1) The history behind Korea's takeover of America is very different in this game. I find the history in this game far less believable than the first game,  2) The story has many holes in it. I feel the game tried to be Mad Max, Farcry, Assassins Creed, Batman, etc in its execution of areas to liberate and cause the whole region to rebel. But how can you rebel in a sector when you got airships in the air above you? When enemies keep spawning?  3) The story was simplistic. You can tell in the first few minutes of the game that the game is setting you up to be the face of the resistance at the end of the story.  4) I don't feel this is open world because why go back to other sectors if they are at 100% rebellion already? Or go back when the storyline has left that area and won't be coming back to there.   I feel perhaps they kept the game they had from 4 years ago (story and design wise) and used the cryengine to make the game look spiffy. They succeeded with that but I feel there was a lackluster effort to give us a better story &amp; open world.

150	1	a	It has been a while since I wanted to play Demigod and I'm happy to say I'm pretty satisfied, despite a few negative reviews I've read about it. In fact, I fully agree that Demigod is a really underrated game, and it's one of the few MOBAs I could relate to Dota in terms of quality.  It doesn't have the complexity of the previous one, but it is still quite entertaining even so. It requires thinking and study - although not as much as Dota -, mainly due to it's minions system. Being so, the game doesn't feel boring after a while - even though, I guess an in-game recommended item build would be very helpfull. While it is a bit hard to add inovative elements to the game genre, Demigod succeeds in having it's own traits that defines it's originality. Each hero has a unique story and they all seem to avoid the commonplace; it's quite easy to feel empathy for some characters (such as Rook - literally a moving castle). What may bother some is that the game's active community is actually pretty scarce. The AI is enough to keep the game fun and interesting; but being a MOBA, it is possible to feel the lack of other players after a while. In summary, I do recommend Demigod, it surely is worth it's cost. The game succeds in keeping you entertained, even though you have to rely mainly on playing against the AI.

3073	1	a	Knytt Underground absorbs you into a beautiful world. The music is atmospheric and changes according to your location. There's striking and interesting scenery wherever you go, and the intricate maze of platforming puzzles fits naturally in these mysterious and serene environments.  This game would be much better if there was no dialog. With rare exception, the humor is uncomfortable and embarrassing and the dramatic parts are offensive somehow. However, the often-preachy and confused writing can be ignored for the most part, as this is predominantly an  excellent  exploration puzzle platformer with only a nod to story.  I'd recommend a gamepad. Some parts expect quick reactions and precise timing where activating abilities mid-air is vital. There are a few puzzles involving the somewhat erratic bouncing physics which are frustrating, but when your character dies, you just restart at the last safe spot you were standing, so there's not much tedious repetition.
2325	1	a	Good game! So far into the game I like the gameplay, atmosphere, and concept. After adjusting the setting to the GeForce Experience recommended setting, which basically recommended me the lowest settings the game floats well and the graphics is still beautiful on my seasoned gaming laptop (Intel Core i7-4700MQ with GTX765M).  The story is credible enough, taking into account alternative history setting. Some glitches here and there, that are likely fixable with patches. Gameplay works well as soon you get used to it. This is a game you must play on the premises of the game. It is not a pure stealth game, and not a pure killâem-all game, but something in-between. Get used to that and it is fun.  Since there are so many bad reviews I feel I must defend myself, so I will do. If you want DOOM, get DOOM. If you want COD, get COD. If you want The Division, get The Division. They are probably better if those are the game you really want. This game requires something else from you, namely to play as an inferior guerilla soldier in hostile environment with superior power enemies. Tactics are required.   For me this game seems like a perfect warm up to Deus Ex: Mankind Divided and Dishonored 2. Give it a chance if you share my motivation.

1721	1	a	I don't understand why this game has such a bad rap. Sure, the intro is 30 minutes long and unskippable, but the game plays like an urban Far Cry title with weapon and character / gear customization, vehicles, stealth, lock picking and 'hacking'. The gunplay is decent, nothing special but it's fun enough on it's own. The ability to drastically modify your weapon mid-firefight is pretty cool. I haven't paid any attention to the story, so I can't really rate that, but all in all, the game is at least fun. I understand it had a terrible launch, and it was a sequel no one really wanted, but if it wasn't called 'Homefront' I think this game would have done a lot better. Not worth $60, but $30? Maybe. $20, definitely.

511	1	a	I got to play the Devil's advocate. 9/10.  Just quickly going to mass to ask for forgiveness.
671	1	a	When I first heard that they had finally decided to make Little Nicky into a video game, I had my reservations. I assumed it'd basically parrot back a bunch of snarky remarks from the film and follow the same [Oddball Character Introduced &gt; Conflict Arises &gt; Oddball Not Such A Bad Guy &gt; Oddball Makes Friends &gt; Oddball Gives Up &gt; Friends Rescue Oddball &gt; Everyone Falls In Love With Everyone] plotline that every other Adam Sandler movie has followed. But the creator gives the story an interesting twist! (Except the ending. Your Uncle Tom has sex with everyone in the mansion and then the game ends, so that's kind of the same.) But in this game Adam Sandler actually plays a role other than Guy With Fart Machine! In this game, Adam Sandler is Malcolm McDowell. First, the conflict arises. Your jerk of a Dad, like, wants you to rule hell and stuff. But instead of being all, like, 'BUT DAAAAD I DON'T WANNA RULE HELL! I WANNA PLAY WITH MY FART MACHINE!' Adam Sandler's all like 'This works for me. Killing idiots is fun. Does this humanitarian gesture come with a dental plan?' Then comes the part where Adam Sandler WOULD prove he's a good guy. And then, this is crucial now...he's NOT a good guy. He starts killing people and they, like, want to be friends and stuff because he's got, like, a moonpie face. But Malcolm McDowell Sandler is like ADAM SANDLER DON'T NEED NO MAN and like stuffs people in light sockets and stuff. Oh my god it's so cool. And your grandpa's all like FAMILY BONDING IS IMPORTANT and Adam Sandler's like I AIN'T NO GRANDPA'S BOY and guts him like a saggy skinned old fish. Then would come the part where he would give up because the cops and church are like 'I've never really been able to actually CONVICT anyone of a crime, but...process of elimination tells me that you must be the killer since, like...errbuddy ded lol' but does Adam Sandler give up and wait for his friends to save him? NO. Old Sandler might, but McDowell Sandler's crazy like a fox! He's all like GET IN THAT LIGHT SOCKET. And then the devil's all like BRO...I RESPEK YOU and then the game ends and you're, like, funny like Adam Sandler, but also not a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.  In conclusion; this Adam Sandler is cooler than real Adam Sandler. So if you don't like Adam Sandler movies, that's ok because this one's better. If you do like Adam Sandler movies, but also liked The Happening, then this is good too because New Malcolm Sandler also has these, like, tree powers than let him tell disco fans and college kids to put their faces in woodchippers.  8/10 Needs more Adrian.
785	1	a	Lucius has a very interesting concept behind it. The idea of playing the monster that is murdering people without others finding out about it is very brutal but a cool idea. However, this game has multiple problems with controls and communication. This causes simple puzzles to be both difficult to figure out and difficult to execute once you know the solution.   Overall, I would NOT recommend Lucius, but I support the ideas behind it and look forward to another game like it that has better puzzle and control design.

296	0	a	I can really only recommend this game if you get real cheap (right now it's 90% off and thus $2 making it worth it), but since the normal price is $20 I can't recommend this game. The reason I was interested in this game is because of the obvious: you're the son of the devil and you kill people. However the story doesn't really go beyond this (just the brief musings of the detective at the end of a chapter). You barely, if at all, get to know any of the people before you kill them. When there's no personality or character development with the characters then there's nothing felt when you kill them. I could forgive this if the ways that you setup the deaths of people weren't the very definition of linear. This too could be forgiven except the steps you take to setup the deaths are also very unintuitive. They aren't even puzzles; it's just a process of figuring out what weird way the developers want you to setup the next person's death. There's almost no thought or intelligence involved on your part.  Another thing I was interested in, like most people I'm sure, are the deaths themselves. Considering this game was supposed to have earned an AO for Adults Only rating from the ESRB (refused to avoid complications with release) I was a little disappointed. A couple of them are gruesome sure, but they've got nothing on some of the fatalities in the Mortal Kombat games (which are rated M for Mature). There is a kill that Lucius himself gets to personally make, but I was highly disappointed when we don't actually get to see Lucius do it. One minute he's standing there, and we know what he's about to do, but the next he's done it and we saw nothing. Boo!  You are slowly given 5 different powers to make these deaths happen. They can also level up in power when you make a new kill. Only problem is the concept of leveling them up is absolutely pointless because there's only 1 way to setup the death of a person and you are always at the right power level to do it. You don't get to use certain powers when you think you could either, because again there's only 1 way to make the deaths happen.  Pros: +Voice acting was decent or better, especially Lucifer's. +The basic concept.  Neutral: +-A couple of the deaths are cool. Most are forgettable. +-It's pretty easy to get lost; a minimap would've been nice. At least there is a map and a marker telling you where your kill target is located.  Cons: -The story lacks any depth beyond the obvious, and the characters themselves are given no time to develop or have much of a personality so that when they do die we the players don't care one way or the other. -Figuring out what to do next is part luck and part tedious searching of rooms and objects to find the right thing to interact with. -Completely linear death setups that don't allow creativity of your mind powers or anything else. -Mind powers have no depth despite being able to level up. -The graphics are pretty poor. Could be forgiven but the animations are also lacking which doesn't help the already lifeless characters.  Despite all this I am interested in the sequel and the promise that it corrects some of the issues here like linear deaths.

1820	0	a	Imagine buying a car, it looked cool in the pictures, drove smooth in the TV ad and gave you a sense that life would be better when you owned your very own. The price was reasonable, it had all the parts, but when you get in the door opens with screech, the key required a little force to get into the ignition and it reluctantly starts up after turning over a few times.   Your first ride is rough and bumpy, there's strange noises coming from everything, so you find yourself deviating from your course home to feel out the problems with a few detours, twists and turns, trying to pinpoint the issues it seems to have with the steering. The air-con doesn't seem to hold the right temperature, so you wind down the electric window, only to find there's a slight stutter as it drops a few steps, rather than giving a smooth wind. The stereo is only picking up a few stations with a bit of static, you can't find a good song and the talkback channels are a bit annoying, the off switch doesn't seem to work, so you just have to turn the volume down to 0%. You wanna have a cigarette to calm your nerves and frustration, but there's no lighter or ash tray, even so, you can't be bothered pulling into the 7-Eleven to buy a lighter, because you just wanna get the damn thing home and assess the whole deal, so you just imagine how good it would have been to have a smoke with your cool new ride.  You've driven around in the built up areas for a while now, the GPS has led you astray a few times and the route path seems quite disjointed, so you decide to jump on the freeway and open up before you dump it home and watch a movie to get your mind off things, there only seems to be four gears that grind into place even with the softest clutch control, and the engine has a limiter on, so you can't even let some frustration out by breaking the speed limit, but even then, the fuel gauge starts beeping and you've just hit reserve level.  You get it Home and park out Front, giving the thing a bit of gas in neutral to test The engine Revolution, which is a little underwhelming, but for some reason you're not entirely upset, but more disappointed with your new car, it has a slightly unique shape and colour from other cars, but the same stock-standard cheaply sourced parts from various suppliers, that don't seem to have been oiled or put together properly. Quality control was probably a bit slack, and you get the feeling this model was rushed into production to meet demand.  You find yourself having to shoulder-barge the door open to get out, the button doesn't work to remotely lock the doors and set the alarm, so you have to go back and lock it manually. Pulling the key out, you realise the back left tire is flat, but you just walk inside and throw the car keys on the floor, crack open a nice cold beer and wonder why you hadn't read any reviews about the car, waited a little longer before buying a brand new model or just taken it back to the dealer instead of driving all the way home. You're not entirely bummed though, it may be because you're equipped with those silly human traits of faith and hope, so you decide you'll leave it for a while, wait for a tow truck and let the mechanics sort it out eventually, because with a bit of oil, some fine tuning and a few added features, this car could one day be a sweet ride. But for now, you'll just use your trusty old whip to get you around.

2271	1	a	Having played the first Homefront on PC, I had to get this one before its launch. I must say the open world game play is amazing you can recruit resistant fighters to fight with you in the battle to reclaim the fallen America from the clutches of the Korean Agressors. weapons can customised to your fighting needs. Taking over strongholds would help the resistant side immensly in the war for Aamerica. This is one action packed game you must own. It is very addictive and cutting edge. The first game was more story driven whereas this game focuses more on the open world fighting aspect.  I still have a fair way to go with this game. If you love taking down the oppressor, But love Samsung phones. This is the game to get.  The scary reality is that the North Korean war could happen in the distant future. What you see in the news today is a scary reality. It could happen to us in real life.  We must stand up for what we believe in and to always KEEP ON FIGHTING.   10/10 MUST HAVE ON PC.
163	1	a	This is game is basically DOTA (WC3 Mod that took on a life of its own.) In it's current state it seems buggy, however the games community has released a number of fan patches that have made the game more enjoyable that can be used on line. I hated it at first, but found that these patches made the difference. This will never be a top 10 but for the price it s worth checking out.
2780	1	a	Deadly Premonition oscillates between brilliant and tedious. In terms of quality this game is hard to recommend, but if you give it a shot the game will surprise you with intriguing story, of wich you might fall in love with this game.

2052	1	a	I think this game is fun for the average gamer. I'm an average gamer that plays lots of games that I think are interesting. This one, while the setting is dumb, is relatively fun. It isn't the most optimized game, I get random major frame drops right after a section is loaded up. But it only lasts a couple second. there are some bugs and glitches, but nothing that is game breaking. Personally I think this game is fun, if you find it interesting. Look up some gameplay first, then decide if you want to buy it.

25	1	a	This game is a great mix of RTS, MOBA, and RPG style gaming. Very addicting and worth the price.
2730	1	a	Deadly Premonition is a unique experience that every videogame enthusiast should play.   The game obviously looks a bit rough around the edges and surely doesn't have the tightest controls, but once you get used to it, it will suck you in and never let go until you get to the end.  Its setting is heavily inspired by David Lynch's Twin Peaks, which may be a plus (it is for me), however as the story progresses you realize that it stands on its own and it's actually pretty interesting.  Every character you'll meet has some peculiarity that makes him or her different from the others, and you will likely get attached to York, the protagonist, one of the best playable characters of the last gen, IMHO.  Things I didn't like are basically related to the bad PC port: long loading times even on an SSD, crashes and some problems with getting my gamepad to work.   It was worth the trouble anyway.  Buy this game, you won't get to play anything like this for some time.

1447	0	a	I was willing to forgive the poor performance and numerous bugs until I got to the last mission and encounted a game-breaking bug. A piece of debris stopped an NPC truck from moving forward. I couldn't blow it up, shoot it, run into it, etc. Even loading the previous checkpoint didn't solve the problem. I reached out to Dambuster Studios and Deep Silver and have had no response yet.
664	1	a	Although the story is just filled with plot holes and therefore unimaginable, I did enjoy the concept. The cinematopgraphy was incredible and a joy to view (just look at the screenshots I took), however they were unsupported by poor voice acting throughout. The only voice actor I found believable was the actor playing Will.   Further, the games way of giving you a certain item to display hints on your hud was flawed as it didn't just show you hints specificially for the mission you were on, but instead, (I kid you not), it showed you hints for future missions aswell creating total confuson.   An example of a plot hole I identified: -There is no way Lucius' parents are fine with never hearing Lucius' voice before, actually no one should be. However, they live day to day fine with it. Further, everyone in the house doesn't seen affected by the murders in the manor expect for the mother displaying a natural character arc.   TL;DR: +Great game, great cutscenes, interesting concept - Poor voice acting, flawed help system, can't sympathise with characters due to lack of intentions and character arc.  
1997	1	a	First off I will say that yes, there are some buggy issues with the game right now, but if you enjoy feeling like a stealthy bad-â¥â¥â¥ in anyway, this game is probably for you. Gameplay feels great and is pretty easy to immerse youself into the game. I am looking forward to the next couple patches to really solidify a fun resistance expereince.
1986	1	a	There isn't an inbetween yes and no as this game is in the Middle. It's not BAD, it's not GOOD either, it's an ok game. My advise is to wait until it's patched and optimized.    Good points; Gameplay Weapons Hours of gameplay Back story via collectables RC cars ;)   Bad points: Runs slow on a pc with 16GB of ram and a 8GB graphics card... HOW!!  Cheesy acting ONLY two levels of a hidden game which I won't spoil for people unaware there is a classic game hidden in the game ;) NO multi-player, only co-op Spawning behind you insta-kill shotgun b*****ds!   7/10

There are a bunch of different weapons, but as far as I can tell they all do the same damage and combos/specials, and a bunch of cosmetics (shirts shoes, pants, backpacks, etc.)      The core gameplay is running around whacking zombies with your melee weapon or shooting them with your range, your melee gets combos with finishers, combos being x--&gt; y x--&gt; x--&gt; y x--&gt; x--&gt; x--&gt; y and your pistol gets like a grenade charge thing.     As it stands now I cant reccomend this game, because as it turns out, this game is complete.

1464	1	a	If you want a solid, semi-open-world shooter with all of the modern frills, you could do far worse than Rev 2. The setup is still ludicrous -- North Korea turns America into an occupied apocalyptic hellscape -- but it's pretty clear that the headcanon is that China are the bad guys, which is slightly less ludicrous. In any event, I had a very good time crawling around like the dirty Yankee rat that I am, avoiding contact when I could, and gunning down the faceless Yellow hordes when I couldn't. All of the various gameplay systems work well without any real gripes on my part, except maybe that the weapons lack enough 'oomph'. The graphics and effects are nicely current-gen in 2016. I recommend Rev 2 to anyone who wants a decent FPS to fill their time between the big releases.   Note that I played the game after it was patched up and the price knocked down half.

2463	1	a	Great game. 120+ hours of play time. I don't know the last time I got this many hours out of a single player game. Maybe never.  It was a bit rough at the start playing as a priest with hardly any spells and low chance to cast them successfully, but it gets much better. Use plenty of magic seal items at the start (instant magic spell items with 100% success) until your own magic abilities get better. When you get AoE spells much later in the game you will be unstoppable.  The story is very unique compared to other games I've played, and the gameplay is too. It combines investigation with regular RPG elements very well.

2400	1	a	I pre-ordered this game the day before it came out because I like spending money and, well, it's honestly nothing too remarkable. I remember it but nothing stood out as incredible which is a shame. I do remember liking the multiplayer more then the single player but considering nobody really plays this game anymore, nothing much there to do.  all in all, for the price now and after the recent update, I'd buy it. Good time for a couple days.
896	0	a	Bought this game on sale because it seemed interesting. I lost interest the moment the bugs kicked in. I've had framedrops on cutscenes, a bug which forced me to redo several chapters due to picking up an item too early and the game not recognizing it being picked up.  Overall this game isn't worth the 21.99 it's listed and it's definetly not worth most people's time.

A small gripe would be that the fluff desciption of the all father disapearing is wrong, the game into says he was killed. This proto-moba could have had a lot going for it, and I would be thrilled to see some of the demi-gods show up in Smite, as at least 2 (Sedna and Queen of thorns, aka The Obsidion Butterfly) are real historical dieites. The Queen may show up, shes Aztac/Mayan, but i doubt they will fit in a lone Inuit diety in the mix. Still between the two Sedna is the one with a dwarf planet named after her.

1620	0	a	Surprise, Homefront sequel is as good as the first. Which with how buggy, poorly written, horribly designed, and cheaply advertised as it was, meant that the bar to do better was set lower than qualifications needed to enroll into ITT Tech. Yet the developers did it, they managed to slide over that bar by making the game visually appealing, and that's about it. Sound design is out of sync, the voice actors seem uninterested, if you listen close enough you can hear their agents writing out their checks over the sound of monotone gunfire. The story is weaker than a polio stricken childs legs, with the US having given the keys to their military to North  Korea...why?  Because they made cool phones and apps. Your character doesn't talk as well, so you're basically Yes man Mario, with strong political views. Which with how the story plays out is really out of place. Questioned if you're a spy for the North Koreans, your lack of response clearly means you're not, and so you're trusted with every detail of the underground rebel fighters hide outs, weaknesses, locations, etc.  Outside of the story and sound, the Ai is terrible as well. You can be in the middle of a warzone running around with your gun out, but a few feet away a military patrol can be standing idly swapping kimchi recipes completely ignoring you. Taking out enemy stronghold points for your 'resistance' to take over is pretty simple as well. Walk into an area and shotgun enemies in the face as they frantically run around suffering Stormtrooper syndrome by missing most of their shots. Probably would have had more trouble firing a shotgun into a barrel of gerbils than I did taking on any of the threats in this game.  If the first game was supposed to be inspired by the movie Red Dawn, Homefront: The Revolution is more like watching Patrick Swayze die of pancreatic cancer.
1181	1	a	The game has some really inspired visuals and interesting ideas; the plot is simple, but the storytelling is neat, with backstories and subplots, and the and everything is entertaining for the whole duration of the game. Some bugs and interactions may be cause of involuntary hilarity: higly recomanded for fans of b-movies

1631	1	a	I was hesitant to buy this game because of all the bad reviews. I will say it is playable and cryengine looks good although I am disappointed that it doesn't have dual GPU support. Still my fury x coupled with a 5820k @ 4Ghz runs it on very high/ultra at 3440x1440. I don't get any stuttering except when the game saves.  It would be better if I could run both my fury x's :) like I can on crysis 3.  Yeah it's glitchy. Whenever it rains in game there is a strobe effect on the ground which is really irritating. The NPC AI is incredibly poor. Be prepared for some dumb enemies and allied NPCs doing things like blocking the player into corners of the room. Incredibly annoying programming basically.    I had read in reviews that enemies keep spawning until the player hides and/or runs away. I wasn't sure whta that meant but I am now.  To me though it's obviously a gameplay design choice the developers made and is part of building the atmosphere.  It's playable and I am going to play it through. Not worth the money though. Wait for it to go on sale. It is clearly a game that was released before it had been completed. If the deveoplers had the time and money then I am sure it would have been a far more polished product.  If I was feeling cynical I would say it has the feel of whoever provided the budget just wanting to break even. If it had been finished before it was released it would have been a great game. Still good enough to play though.  The following are just some additional musings......  I don't know if cryengine is optimised for amd. I would doubt it's optimised for either amd or nvidia and is a generic game engine for licensing to third parties. I am not talking about cry engine 3 which was optimised for amd in crysis 3 and is still one of the most hardware punishing game engines out there along with the 4A engine used in the metro games which is optimised for nvidia of course :)   Anyway recently I fired up far cry 3 again. It's unplayable using CF and if I use one card it's glitchy and I get ridiculous framedrops, stuttering and freezes. This is on an i7 5820k @ 4Ghz, 16GB of DDR4 Ram, Radeon R9 Fury X in 2 way crossfire, 3440x1440 acer @ 75hz. The OS is windows 10 pro.  While it is not an insanely over the top set up. It's still a fairly decent gaming machine. Which you would expect to handle Far Cry 3.  I know it's optimised for nvidia and when it dropped originally it was unplayable on amd hardware on higher settings I was using a 7970ghz CF setup. I had to drop the settngs to play it and that still had all sorts of graphics glitches as well.  I am waiting to see what amd has to offer with vega but I could be switching to nvidia. Personally I think it is bad for gaming having these hardware vendor tie ins. A decent set of graphics cards is not cheap. I would probably be better off getting a console.......nah.

Went to support to ask them to sort it out, they firstly seemed like they were trying to be helpful, then they tried to claim I didn't own the steam version, after sending them a screenshot of it in my library for proof the idiot in support somehow thought I had fixed the issue and closed my support ticket, I reopened it and questioned how they came to the conclusion that it was fixed. No response.   Avoid this company.

1058	1	a	If, and only if, you're sick and twisted, like i am, will you enjoy this game... The blood and gore in Lucius is brutal. Even for a gore fan like myself, I even cringed during a few death scenes, and it's so much more brutal because you play a 7 year old child. Lucius, is one of a kind, a child possessed by the devil himself. You then go on a journey of pure carnage, killing the entire household, in many twisted ways. Great game, sometimes it can be frustrating finding the answers to the clues, but its worth it to see the murderous scenes that unfold... The gameplay is nice, runs and looks great, not too long, but not too short either, and the achievements flow in as the game goes on. Noticed today that the game went on sale, with a 95% discount, which is insanely good value for the quality of the game you get. I'm looking forward to completing my remaining achievements, and heading on to Lucius 2. 8/10

1591	1	a	I really enjoyed playing this game. Cudos to developers for putting together a great single player campaign. I will say I purchased this game after most of the reported bugs had been patched and had no problems running the game on medium settings with my gtx 760 2 gb card. This game is running on the crysis engine, which is a lot more demanding than other graphic engines I know of. This game is worlds better than the first game. If you are trying to decide if you should buy this game, ignore the overwhelming negative reviews....they are mostly pre-patch reviews where people were having performance issues.   Pro's  + Great environment and sense of detail + Weapon changing system very creative and fun to interact with +Story kept me engaged for a respectable 18 plus hours...Yes it is hard to beleive North Korea took over US but the devs had to stay in keeping with the first game. +Great graphics and sound effects....will definitely replay once I upgrade my graphics card  Con's  -While the zones were decent in size, I wish the zones would have been linked into one zone...more open world  Overall, if you enjoy first person, open world games, you should pick up Homefront. Support the people who went through so much and so many years to bring us this great titile. I hope to see a sequel to this game in the future.

1539	1	a	  Well... It's not too bad. It's an average open world shooter. You might be into this style of game but i pretty much get bored of it.  I only really played this because of three reasons, one being i have a brand new 1060 graphics card which makes the game gorgeous looking so it gave it a good work out and the other being that there's an easter egg that contains two FULL levels of god damn TIMESPLITTERS 2 that works with mouse and keyboard. Oh... and it was free because of the free weekend thing so, why not? But i stayed for Timesplitters and i wouldnt have given Homefront a second look if it wasnt for that easter egg.  I mean, it has some nice ideas and some pretty great scenery, but it's just... eh, you've played it before. Just imagine Far Cry 3 and 4 in an urban environment and that's pretty much this. I guess i recommend the game but i'd wait for a discount maybe? Just don't buy it too expensive, like.  Anyway, speaking of that easter egg. Hey, see that Dambuster, former Free Radical i'm sure? You see that arcade cabinet? That's what i want in a shooter, that's fun. Open world stuff is overdone, i want to pick up a shooter that's Maybe your teasing ports of Timesplitters 2 and 3 on PC or a remaster or something. I want a shooter that doesnt take itself seriously and Timesplitters is 10/10 in my book. So... you know, please release them on PC? You know you want to.

2320	1	a	I find the other reviews drastically over dramatic towards the game and honestly i am perfectly fine with it since i am not choosing an side to both good or bad sides of people's opinions.  My honest opinion i find the game quite entertaining with the objectives and some how the stealth in the game in yellow and green zones to wake up a uprising! but i have to behonest the preformance is bad, the A.I. and so on... and we all know that! But dont you think the devs would know aswel after hearing the crying and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥tting of other â¥â¥â¥â¥ reviewers? yes, of course they did, and if you use some common sence they of course would go and fix it, they are obvious issues to the game preventing gameplay. I think people should just be patient and just â¥â¥â¥â¥ing wait xP With the other â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t aside from cry baby's like Jim Sterling, i find the game entertaining, only issues i've had was the freezing issue and the A.I. apart from that i looked past it and enjoyed the game to the fullest, i would say a 8/10. I would recommend it when the updates and patches are made for the main issues to the game so you can enjoy it! aside that, i hope you all had a nice time! c:

1956	1	a	This game got quite a lot of flak, but considering it took 4 years of development time by a new studio and with quite a few people...... It wasn't all THAT bad, for me at least.  In fact I actually liked it, the graphics were great, it ran smoothly, gun modifications were fabulous. I've always enjoyed the capturing stronghold element of games like far cry, so I was happy it was included here.  Yes the story felt predictable, and the hype around walker died down faster than a boner after watching a porno with an actual story... BUT that ending redeemed it for me.   I for one am looking forward to a sequel.

475	1	a	A very interesting and enjoyable game, especially when you are the villain. Lucius basically plays like a 3rd person adventure game, where you take items and use them to complete tasks like killing people or doing chores, but mostly killing people.(This game is very graphic in some of the killings.) You're playground is the entire house, that unlocks completely after the third murder, but you can only kill a specific individual at a time. The tools can be collected at any time during the game even if you don't need them for that murder. As a reward for you're sacrifices you get paranormal powers that will help you kill more people. Powers like Telekinesis which isn't quite precise, mind control which is only used after everything else was prepared for the murder, mind wipe in case you get caught and a fireball for the boss battles which ware not enjoyable.  For the things this game gets right one thing one thing will annoy you a lot, that is the speed of the game. The tutorial is extremely fast, but after that it takes ages to figure out what to do, sometimes it's obvious, sometimes you get so stressed you look at a walkthrough just to get past that part (and whenever I need help outside what the game provides, it ruins the experience). Also the fact that the game does not have any checkpoints or save system outside the start of each chapter, if you make a mistake you go back to the start of that chapter. Another thing that I think the game could do without are the stealth levels and to some degree the boss battles.  A rather unique game, it mostly reminds me of the first Black Mirror game, a horror adventure game that was also slow, that had difficult puzzles and that also had a plot about the devil needing sacrifices for power. If you like adventure games and are looking for a horror story where you get to do the killing, this is the game for you, just be patient on the ride.

HF:TR has everything a open world game need and it really lives upto the 'open world' genre,a decent story with bunch of decent characters like moon jesus she's crazy, however there were some cons to it like the weapon customization was very limited i mean VERY limited for each weapon and there was nothing exept kust bikes wich were all the same! jesus,u could at least add more variety to bikes right?! no color customization for anything not guns nor bikes,but the pros are more than the cons and beside the stuff i said, i really had a fun experience throught the game though i havnt yet finished it. i vote 7/10.

653	0	a	Lucius was a fun game but at times it felt more like a chore to complete this game. While the story was entertaining it was a little bland and the only thing that made up for this were the innovative kills and humor in said kills. Not only did the story struggle to entertain me, but the constant running around the house to find the most minute details aggrevated me to the point of looking at walkthroughs to find what I missed and where to go. I really wanted to enjoy Lucius and on some level I did, but if I were to give a rating it would be a 6.5/10. I think it didn't live up to what it could have been. I'm kind of in the middle about this game. Be warned that you may spend a lot of time roaming around wondering where to go.

1571	0	a	So I just Finish this game here is my review.  I did notice a lot of bugs while playing performance was bad at some points there was a lot of lag at points when doing a missions and ending side quests but I think everyone knows this.  So Pros and Cons.  Pros 1. the weapon systen is pretty sweet been able to change your gun to get the job done. 2. when taking over over the area you do see your allies all over fighting the KLPA so it feels like the missions you do does count. 3. the enviroment is pretty good it does give that feel that america has been taken over. 4. The Equitment in game was good gave me a lot of options on how to go about the missions  Cons 1. I do not like the bike the reason is just because there is a bike in game does not mean you need to make about 50% of the side quests need to be done with a bike that powers up a generator it gets really boring. 2. The Ai in game so many clones I felt like I was in Star wars the Clone wars....... 3.The Acting in this Game my God it felt like they went and got people that have never acted in there life it was so bad my head started to hurt listening to it. 4. The weapons I think they need to learn what recoil is my god it was so bad.  I will have to Give this a No for now it needs a lot of fixes and heaps more work this Game needed at least another year in Development way to soon to put it out it feels like a Alpha game might of been best to bring this out in EA and worked on it than people would of not been so negetive towards.

1041	1	a	Lucius is a puzzle game where your goal is to assasinate people in order to please your father lucifer without being caught in the process, each time you mkae a sacrifice, you become more powerful on one of the different evil magic areas, telekinesis, mind control, mind erase and fireball, altho fireball is only usable in very specific ocasions. The graphics are not bad at all but it's poorly optimized, controls are ok to play with, sadly you can't use a gamepad. Some of the deaths in the game are very gruesome, sadly there's not enough graphics quality to back that up. For achievement hunters this is a easy game to get them all, except the play 20 and 40 hours ones.

277	1	a	Despite its ups and downs, I think overall itâs a good game. If you just remember that it is a game and it would have been really difficult to give it the kind of freedom you might have been expecting, that is.   (I tried to keep this one fairly short but alas, that just didnât happen. Prepare your attention span!)  I meant the above in the sense that this game tries to give you an âopenâ feeling to it, as if itâs not linear and you are wreaking havoc at your own expense. But when you get down to it, it is linear. Itâs quite closed and itâs more of an organised chaos then just plain olâ chaos. Given that, itâs still a very enjoyable game. I would consider this game still quite indie, so that makes me think even more that for what resources they had or what they were capable of with a small team, they pulled off a really decent game.  Because of how the gameplay is laid out, each chapter youâre given a new target and in ways it kind of felt like more of a puzzle to figure out what you had to do with them rather then you plotting your own devilish plan. Which I still found quite fun.   There was a few times I really had no idea what I was supposed to do. Especially at the beginning when you get past the early stages of the game where parts of the house are blocked off and you canât roam around as much. When the game stopped leading me to where and what I was supposed to do and I was finally able to access the whole house, I wasnât sure on how it was supposed to work. Can I pick them off in any order, do I have to do them in an order and if so, what is the order, or what? Well, after wondering around for a long time completing chores of which I wasnât sure of why I was doing either, I finally figured it all out.  So, if you get something similar Iâd just say stick with it, it all becomes clear as you go. My state of confusion didnât last too long and in all honesty I can be dumb as hell sometimes.   In terms of story it was interesting. I wasnât really sure of where they were going with it or how the whole thing was going to conclude but I was eager to find out. Itâs nothing too profound or life changing but it was definitely not predictable or disappointing.   The English voice acting in this game is a little cringe worthy at times. Itâs not horrifically bad but you can tell there is no Academy Award winners amongst the lot. The worst in my opinion being the stereotypically drunk Irish janitor.  With that said, I donât think this game is primarily English. So I can see how the English voice acting might be a little lacked if they were focused mainly on another language.   Moving onto graphics. The graphics are pretty decent and I think I would say that âscenery and general surroundingsâ-wise is where its strengths are at. The AI and character models however are not the best. I got a very âGarryâs Mod videos before Valve Source Filmmakerâ feeling off of it at times. I might be over exaggerating a bit there. I think itâs just the expressions and slight glitches to the models that gave me that feeling. The AI is very robotic, the characters wonder around the house replaying a laid out routine (which I guess they have to on some level, seeing as certain characters need to be âluredâ to a certain place and you can only do that by waiting for them to lap back around to where you need them). They also shout the same sets of dialog at you whenever you get within a certain radius of them (doesnât even matter if thereâs a wall between you, you WILL get yelled at through walls).  Just to moan about the characters that tad bit more and bore you all to death when itâs not really necessary because I actually like the game, I am going to mention the lack ofâ¦ wellâ¦ characterâ¦ that I felt from our little man Lucius.  This isnât something that bothered me all that much but I thought it worth mentioning.  I love the concept of playing as a slightly younger character. âAmong the Sleepâ Is what Iâm going to be comparing to. Among the Sleep was a game where you played as a toddler and the child like mannerisms and little gestures and what not in that game really impressed me. You walk, talk and generally act like a toddler. You run too fast? Youâre poor little baby self will fall over.  Maybe this wasnât the best comparison to use seeing as the obvious age difference with the two characters in the two games. A 2 year old Vs. a 6 year old is hardly the same. But I kind of felt that the fact Lucius is so young and therefore it being so disturbing him being so sadistic, wasnât emphasised enough. I kind of felt like I was just playing as a midget adult. Which, I guess you could argue he isnât like a child at all and maybe that is the point? But, I think I would have enjoyed it a bit more if Lucius had more âdemon childâ like characteristics. Especially given that your character doesnât speak, mute characters usually need something to show their character in others ways then just talking. Or maybe I am just over analysing!  In terms of achievements this one is very doable. I played through the whole game and ended up going back for some achievements (which is easy to do seeing as there is a chapter select included). Iâm currently at 97% and in honesty the last two I need are baffling as too why theyâd even add them in. The last two are for playing the game for 20 and 40 hours. Now, Iâd say I must have played through the game one and a half times. With that Iâm at 9 hours at the moment. Now, with some simple maths you can obviously see that youâd need to play the game a nonsensically amount of times to actually get the 40 hour achievement. I know itâs titled âIâm addictedâ but I think Iâd actually feel genuinely worried for anyone that played a game about a demon child murdering people that many times. I think Iâll just idle for these last two! Other than that though, itâs an easy 100%.  EDIT: I have found that with the two last achievements, you cannot idle the game on the menu screen! You actually have to be in the game for it to work! (Hence why I have 72 hours on record, not just the 40 I need. Took me a while to notice it wasnât working) I thought this was worth mentioning for any achievement hunters out there.  All in all, despite me moaning and droning on about certain things, I would say this game is great and well worth a try. Itâs something a bit different and unique. It also has a sequel of which I think Iâm definitely going to be trying out. If youâre looking for something fun and mischievous to play then this one is a good place to start. Overall I got a very positive feeling off of this one.   TL;DR: Quite linear, interesting story, kind of cringe English voice acting, decent graphics, alright characters, an easy 100% and generally a lot of fun. Definitely try it if youâre looking for a bit of mischievous fun.

2504	1	a	Inquisitor is a very old-school take on the diablo 1 / 'Hard RP' RPG type game.  It's got loads of text, tons or reading to do to understand what the heck's going on, but it immerses you right in the world.  You are (theoretically) the arm of god, pardoned for a crime, and sent to a small village to look into some strange occurances. You have a wide latitude of juristiction, and are expected to gather evidence, point fingers, and (again, theoretically), figure out what's truly happening in the world, and do something about it.  ... That said, you could just as easily (probably more easily) abuse your position, blame the wrong people, and sentence them to imprisonment, torture, or death.  You will also be required to kill a veritable bucketload of monsters that plague the countryside, delve into dungeons, gather supplies and armourments, and (likely) gather a group of like minded people to help you on your quest (for good or evil, as the case may be).  If you like diablo 1, but found the story &amp; world-space way too simple, Or you liked arcanum, and found the world too hopeful &amp; bright, You might just like this game.  The world is full of that 'old-school' religious oppression, the combat systems unforgiving, and the story heavy and dark.  I rate is 8/10.

1990	1	a	I am LOVING this game... the weapons feel authentic and visceral. The graphics are phenominal and the gameplay sucks you in and makes you feel part of the world.  The combat feels like organized chaos which is exactly how urban combat should feel, There are many times you will be slowly walking through a warehouse listening for your enemies while they are listening for you and then you see eachother at the same time and fast bloody firefight insues. The AI is also interesting and surpised me several times with their actions, for example there was once where I am on the street about to enter a building when an enemy soldier starts screaming at me in Korean from behind, he did not instantly shoot me... I froze and stood there for a moment while he is yelling at me with his gun up, I then quickily dart to the right into the building and right when I do so he opens fire and bullets spray the doorway I was in just moments ago.  As far as some peoples complaints about it not running well... it has Crysis 3 level of detail and graphics only in a a large open world... It is going to bring your 970 to its knees not because it is poorly built but because it is built so well... I have two 980 TIs SLI'd and ran it with everything on high in 2k with a steady 70 FPS. Just for arguments sake I turned it from 2k to 1920x1080 which is what most people are running it at and cranked everything up to very high and ran at a steady 90 FPS... I then turned it back to 2k and down to high as it looks amazing this way and runs fine. If your computer can't run it fully cranked that is fine as the game still looks amazing on high rather then very high just turn some graphics options down... So stop giving the game bad reviews just because your computer is not powerful enough to run it please.
2065	1	a	Amidst all the bad reviews, I'm glad I gave this game a chance. This is not a COD game where you can run and gun. You have to strategize, take cover, know when to fight and when to run. Once they sorted out the optimization issue, this game will be a solid 8/10 for me.

2064	1	a	ive played about 7 hour and am gonna review Homefront now... Im running a GTX 960 4gb and an I5-4690K  i clock in with about 50 fps on High settings with 1080p graphics. its not 60 but its still higher than HITMAN... The game looks beautiful and the movement is super fluid (movement is like a river that is super beautiful to look at and handle) If youve never played Homefront i suggest that you get this game when you can because its really fun. if you are like some people however and like to â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ about not getting 60fps then you should wait to get it... I give this game a 9.5/10
3115	1	a	A really unique platformer. I love to just run around exploring in beautiful and fascinating environments without any hectic. ItÂ´s perfect as a stress reliever but itÂ´s not unchallenging, so it doesnÂ´t get boring. Also itÂ´s really great to know that there are optional secrets everywhere, so if you feel like exploring a bit more than usual, there is always something to find.  The story is rather lush, but itÂ´s much more about the people you meet, rather than saving the world. All of them have their own little story and itÂ´s refreshing to get to know their world view instead of just saving their day and be done with it.   To round it up it has a nice soundtrack. I recommend this game for everyone who likes platformers and for hard working casuals, because itÂ´s great to come back to this game every now and then, explore some more and relax.

Long story short, this game suffers heavily from bugs and glitches, There is no point in playing until the end with this uninspired setting and boring story and characters. I don't feel attached to anyone because there are no personality in these characters. Game graphics looks superior because it is built on the Cry Engine, but other than that, there is nothing great in this game worth mentioning. My rating: 1/5

Runs like a dream for me. The gun play is quite, quite good. Story is generic. The open world is pretty boring. Characters were pretty bland except for Dana who was marginally better than the rest of the cast.  I would not pay full price this. Wait for a deal if you can.  I have enjoyed myself, I was just expecting more. For a discounted price, I can recommend it.

I suggest that the devolopers should add some more weapons and a bigger map full of more stuff in the sequel (if their is one.)

I actually pre-ordered this game months ago and never looked back. That being said if you are an adult with a job and their own money to spend I would recommend investing in this game. I am sure haters are going to hate because that is what they do. So let them do their jobs. Because truth be told, if you ain't got no haters you ain't poppin!  8.5/10 before patch. 10/10 after patch.  Guns-check Sandbox-check Asymmetrical warfare-check Underlying social commentary-always!

52	1	a	Great game to play with friends! Amazing strategy. Ignore the bad reviews, everything in this game works just fine, including online play.
141	0	a	This is a MOBA. I'm not sure I understood that before I bought it but once I was in a game I realized, oh, this is laning and pushing and knocking down towers. There's a few differences, you take territory rather than simply wrecking enemy towers, and you can spend money to benefit your entire team with team upgrades and tower upgrades, as well as purchasing things for yourself. And you can have an army of your own minions, to either back you up or handle a different objective than your hero. The heroes are all pretty slow and the maps are pretty big so you do spend an enormous amount of time walking back and forth to buy things and heal and return to battle. Not long into any game the heroes get so powerful that if you are absent from a lane for even a moment, an enemy can take out a tower or two, so I find that a high HP and regend build is sort of OP, allowing you to stay in lane and push, even if your DPS isn't very good. Just being present matters more than being powerful. Some characters appear to be suited for certain roles, IE assassins or tanks, but some characters seem a bit strange. The plant lady would seem to be to be suited best with a big minion army, but she can also tank a bit, and has quite a bit of tower damage and creep extermination, leading me to think that the characters aren't very balanced. If that character has one good build but is flexible enough to be effective at literally everything else, I don't think the character's central role is powerful enough to not opt into the other branches of their tree. Though honestly in my experience the games last so long that you max out nearly everything by the time you win. Again, the heroes get pretty strong. You may spend a lot of money upgrading your towers and minions but it may not matter later on. This leads me to think that completely balanced hero upgrades does not mean that the other upgrades in the game are as balanced. The controls aren't quite fluid and there are times when I died because of it, but eventually I simply learned the quirks of the controls and the incomplete physics of bodyblocking to better avoid stupidly dying to inadequate game physics.  In my opinion this isn't nearly as fun as it should be. A MOBA where you effectively play as really huge characters and you take territory, it sounds really good as a recipe, but the result isn't quite as satisfying as the recipe sounds.

I see a lot of bad reviews on this game, but that's because half of them are AMD users and they complain about everything not working. Oh please enjoy the game for what it is. It isn't bad at all, well made game. The story line already is catching my attention a lot, i'm just looking forward to beating it already and more of the DLC to come out. A few patched need to be done but it runs smooth as Donald Trump's election speeches (JOKES). I definitely recommend getting the game, the sound quality and environmental textures are well defined.

1965	0	a	  Homefront: The Revolution is a game I've been interested in since it was originally announced. After playing the first game in the series in 2011, I was impressed by what I initially saw in the sequel. Although the game is a huge improvemant over the original game in terms of ideas, it's still not a good game. The main character's are sort of cookie cutter and not very well developed. The story is shallow, not well thought out, and in the end feels unimportant. The world design is boring and doesnt feel alive or real. The A.I. in this game is terrible. Strange scripting, like npc's hitting walls with melee weapons for no reason. The gameplay is 'ok' but feels outdated, the gunplay could have been a lot better. I really believe if this game came out 10 years ago (minus the modern graphics obviously) people really would have liked it. Sadly this game doesn't meet todays standards.  The optimization leaves a lot to be desired and I experienced frame drops/hitching/stuttering throughout my 10 hour playthrough of the game. This was on a 980 Ti mind you. I understand performance used to be worse before the latest update, but in my opionion it's nowhere near where it should be. I have seen worse though. Your experience may vary.  This game does have things I really liked. The graphics in some environmonts were great. The game also features a great gun customization resembling the one featured in the 'Crysis' series. There was some great character design throughout the game. I was very impressed by the way faces looked in this game as well. Besides the terrible animations, the characters looked real. The game does have a lot going for it, just not enough...  Overall I really think this game should have had A LOT more work. I know people don't like to hear this, but this game really should have been pushed back farther for optimization and gameplay improvements. I really feel this series and game have/had a lot of potential. This series and gamers deserve better.
1545	1	a	Great Stuff!  Atmospheric, moody and enjoyable. Satisfying weapons, fantastic derelict waistlands to manoeuvre around. Airships that make your heart jump a beat when they let-off their 'War of the World' type spot alert sound when youve been tagged.  Considering your part of the resistance in the revolution, it's true to its form and is what it should be.  Fortunately for me it runs buttery smooth getting v-synced 60fps @ 1080p with all settings maxed - on GTX 1080 (Aorus X7 DT V6 CF1).  It's a shame some are digruntled over this game, however I personally find there's fun to be had as otheres have also mentioned. It might not float everyone's boat, but I hope to play many hours more when I get the time off from work.
2014	1	a	This game is getting a lot of greif, simply because most computers seem to not be up to the task graphically to support this game. The game was a 35GB download, so you knew it was gonna be massive and that it was going to be graphically demanding. Besides a few FPS shuttering here and there, the game is great. That being said, I feel like this is a MAJOR improvement over the original Homefront, but there is still some room for development. The story could have been better developed and the map could have been a bit larger.   Otherwise, this is a solid game!
726	1	a	Pretty interesting concept
2535	0	a	Game seemed decent until I got to the first dungeon. Lots of grinding on the way, finally get in there and it's LOOOOONG. The difficulty levels in this game change without warning. You'll be having an ok time one second and then out of nowhere 3-4 goblin shamans will start spamming wall of flame and take out your whole party within literally one second. You can't control your party members. They run blindly into combat and chase fleeing enemies right into enemy lines.  If you get poisoned you pretty much have to leave the dungeon and walk all the way back to town for a healer. This will happen every time you see a spider.  Finally I decided to just use console commands to make my dude OP so i could at least enjoy the story.  Nope. Still the same problem. You get one second killed even when you're double the normal level for the dungeon you're in. I'm sorry, I tried to like this game, but I'm out.

2703	1	a	On paper, this game has everything. It's a horror adventure game with an elaborate Twin Peaks-inspired story that takes roughly 20 hours to complete depending on how much time you spend doing sidequests. It's got an open world for you to explore, there's a bunch of ranged and melee weapons, puzzle sequences, hunger mechanic, you name it. The problem is that this game plays and looks like a Playstation 2 game. The graphics are outdated, which wouldn't be too bad if the design wasn't also outdated: it basically plays like a poor man's Silent Hill, and it is full of tedious missions and easy combat encounters.  This PC port is also a mess that is locked to 720p, lacks color filters that the console version apparently had and crashes regularly. You can fix all of this by installing three easy fixes that you can find on the forums, but still. If you want a game that works right out of the digital box and plays like a modern survival horror game, it's hard to recommend this.  Yet, I absolutely loved this game, and it is all thanks to the story and characters. You play as Francis York Morgan, an FBI agent who comes to the small town of Greenvale to solve the murder of a young woman. Sounds familiar? Yes, the game's story is basically a funnier Twin Peaks, and I loved it. It is at times super weird, super funny and super interesting, so it was easy for me to overlook all the shortcomings of the game. The dialogue, story beats and even the cheesy comic relief made this game so easy to enjoy. I just wish this 'Director's Cut' had more stuff to it than extra costumes and some cutscenes, and also made the game look and play a bit better.

1502	0	a	I spent 33 euros. Still not worth it. Played 5 hours now. And all i feel is being bored. Side Missions are boring, main missions are boring. Characters are not likeable. Worst weapon handling iÂ´ve seen for a long time. All weapons feel the same. LotÂ´s of performence issues. Have i7 6700K, GTX 970 OC and 16 GB DDR4 RAM and guess what? Frame drops, freeze, audio stuttering. Dialogues are horrible. Oh did I forgot to mention? Yeah, glitches, bugs and getting stuck on everything in the world.  Really hoped it would be good after the first trailers. But no!!! DonÂ´t buy this game.

1108	1	a	This game gave me a good impiression for the neat graphic. Although I could go and search within the limited area of a mansion, the graphic of furniture and art works is detailed and well placed. I would enjoy the scenery if this game was just a walking simulator. I also enjoyed the cut scenes that are adding good charm on the atmosphere. However, the puzzle was confusing for me. The player can collect items for the current chapter and for the next chapter or for any other at the same time. That means if a certain puzzle that I thought was for the current chapter was about to be solved, I couldn't pass the current chapter since it's supposed later. Sometimes I lost my way wondering what I should do next. But anyway, we can see the game guides that are already posted, so it wasn't a big deal for me. The story is so-so, having a little twist but overall linear. This is an evil vs justice story which sounds typical, but the protagonist is on the evil side. Voice acting is also satisfactory and it has English subtitle.

1856	1	a	I don't get all the hate comments for this game, it's a really good game once you play it for a few hours. It has an awesome campaign, a good story and a bunch of things you can do once you finish it. The only thing that kind of bothers me is that it can bug out sometimes, like getting stuck for no reason and stuff like that. Also, I wish it was better optimized for PCs, but whatever.

2379	1	a	An inferior Far Cry styled game, buggy and a bit unoptimised, however has great graphics and enjoyable gameplay. For any Far Cry fan, this game is worth it when it even goes on a deep discount.
1006	1	a	6/10  At first couple hours, I thought this game is quite boring because how the game machanic it is. It doesn't give you freely how you gonna kill. It locks how you kill, which is only one approach. You just need the right tool which can be found on the right place. and using that tool for the right object. Given that you are at a large maze mansion with multiple rooms. You have to run around and get lost very often. I feel frustrate on running around, and many occasions I have no clue what I have to do. (and then finally looking through walkthrough for that particular stuck)   I still have to no idea why you can collect the item which you can't use right now for the chapter. And then in the later chapter., you don't have go to pick the items because you have collected them already from previously chapter. I think it ruins the game machanic. (for example, in some of chapter, you have to sneak at night, and avoid to get detection in order to collect a necessary item, but.... if you have picked the item on previously chapters, then you no longer need to go.)  The game then become more interested when playing further. I mean when you get used to the game, basicly you have to do something around the target. and use some hint on your notebook to clue you what you are supposed to do. (By the way, you still get confuse what you have to do most of the time)  The story can keep me continue playing, including satisfying dead scene for every end of chapter. However, after finish the game, this game has low replayable because you've known all what you have to do, where you have to go, which spot in the room you have to use your skill on. Furthermore, the extra contents is not good to play with. It's just not polish.    Good: -The dead scene for every end of chapter can satisfy me. -Story driven is good. (I get addict on the first playthough because of this) -The game can push me too keep looking for the sequence... (but from the Lucius2 review... I don't know if I should try Lucius2 or not.)  Bad: -Too frustrate finding the right item on the right place and use it on the right object. -Mansion is too large and quite like a maze. It take you to survey around a very long time until you familiarize with. -linearity with killing method for each chapter.  btw, still recommend this game when it sale. (yep, I got this game on sale for 1 usd)

This game works in slow motion and the I can't do the 1st mission, which is lock the maid in the freezer, byt locking the door when she enters to clean. The game is bugged for me as she doesn't enter the freezer and stay on the door cleaning and I can't close it and lock it. If your computer is as â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up as mine, so please do not buy it, cause it will be a waste of money. *sighs*
1700	1	a	I played this during the free weekend and I have to say that it's impressed me enough for me to spend money on actually buying it.   Yes, it has problems, but there is a good game underneath the glitches and slightly sloppy mechanics. It feels like a weird crossbreed between Dying Light, Far Cry and Half Life 2...that's a compliment by the way. There is the open world of the first two games mentioned, with elements such as base liberation and use of improvised equipment such as RC car explosives, which can be fun. Then there is the world itself, which reminds me quite a bit of City 17 from Half Life 2, with weird futuristic combine like structures side by side with dilapidated tenements.   Despite my annoyances, there is a lot of ambition on display here and I would very much like to see Dambusters have another crack at an open world shooter with a slightly more coherent, focused vision.  All in all...well worth a play!

This game does NOT 'blend action, strategy and role-playing elements into a thrilling new experience' as its description so claims! Demigod is just another â¥â¥â¥â¥ DOTA/LoL clone. Its like SMITE if you were playing it from a top-down perspective instead of 3rd person! DO NOT SPEND ANY MONEY ON THIS GAME! Instead go play SMITE for free, its basically the same game but made as a third person shooter!   0/10 - Would ask for my money back if I thought stardock would actually give it back. Even the $4.99 i spend when it was on sale was not worth the price!

1501	1	a	Single player / Coop Game  + This game uses a bunch of game mechanics that we've seen before in other games, but it uses them well in an open world first person shooter. It's a fun single player experience with lots to do.  + It has a fun coop game mode that uses an rpg style character progression system. 10 coop missions (at date of review)  - It's hard to find a random player for coop. Coop mode allows you to create a game and play by yourself but it wonât be open for other's to join. This creates a bunch of private games happening with everyone playing by themselves.

1078	1	a	Lucius is more of a puzzle game then anything else. There's 18 chapters in the game and each chapter, your goal is to kill a specific person of the Dante Manor, with the exception that some chapters you kill multiple people. It took me about 7 hours to beat this game and I feel like it was worth the money I spent while it was on sale (I beleive $5). Some missions were pretty easy to figure out while others were mearly impossible because the game didn't give you any sense of direction. In some chapters, you only have to find a couple of things to complete the mission, while others, you have to do a list of things. One thing I kept on forgetting was while playing was combining items, (for those of you who haven't played, you get batteries and a flashlight, you select the batteries and then place them in the flashlight). The games does a lot of combining items to make them useful to you, so make sure you don't forget that! Anyways, the quality of the game was iffy. The details seemed pretty fair, but when it goes to cutscenes where people talk, you can tell they didn't pay much attention to making the mouth open when you hear words. The story line made sence to me, like, you will kill a specific person first and then a character that was related to the person you just killed will get depressed and that would be your next target. Overall, I'd give this game a 5/10. I'm only giving it 5 because the story was short and the game didn't really help me with completing chapters which made it frustrating to figure out.  I would only buy it on sale if possible. There is a Lucius 2 which I'll be playing soon.

2603	1	a	N.B. There are some computers that the game just will not display properly on. It's fine on my AMD PC, but my Nvidia laptop can't display any text without severe distortion (both run 64-bit Windows 7, and have the same issue with Amnesia the Dark Descent). I don't know why, but if you can get a demo from somewhere to test whether it works, or check the forums, it might help. Also, this game is available on Xbox 360 and PS3, if you find the PC version isn't for you, although the PS3 version is the same as the Steam version (The Director's Cut).  This is one of the few buggy games I would recommend to people, and there are very good reasons why. For starters, it's horrifying and unique. The story sticks in my mind the way that Walking Dead has, and may I say, even more so.  Did you like Twin Peaks? Do strange events picque your curiosity? Then this game could be for you. You play the role of a FBI agent with a split personality. The twist here is that you, the player, are treated like the secondary personality. York needs your help to solve a cross-country murder spree, which brings him to the town the game is set in.  Mr Francis York Morgan is thust into a stunningly creepy town that appears norma on the surface, but harbours secrets in almost every home. Help York to stop the Raincoat Killer, and oh so much more. Scratch away the surface and look deeper, take your time and explore the world, talk to people each day, and you'll experience the best this story can offer you.  Please, if you feel you can handle a few bugs, give this game a go if only for the plot. Save often lest it crashes (but I've had to do that with Saints Row 4 about the same number of times). This game isn't about combat - it's about everything else. Solve the puzzles, find rare items for townsfolk to help you in your mission, remember the past and recount the present.   If you fancy something strange, and you don't mind rough edges, *please* try this game. Wait for a sale if you're unsure, but don't let it pass by without trying it. Even a year after playing it, the 36 hours I spent in this world are still etched in my mind. Thumbs up all the way.
341	1	a	This title quickly rocketed up to one of my favorite games of the last decade; itâs not flawless, itâs not a blockbuster or a triple A spectacle, but Lucius is exceptionally different, well executed and darkly captivating. I feel that itâs fair to assume that revealing your character to be an evil, twisted little demon child does not merit a spoiler warning. Lucius (even his name is evil) is an extremely rare phenomena of a character; even though he is the main character and you play as him, he is the single most horrifying part of playing this game. Obviously there are no jump scares since you are the one in control of him, but what is terrifying is how easily this fictional child brings out this dark evil personality from the player. The core of the game is a point and click murder mystery with the awesome twist that youâre the âbad guyâ and your goal is to not get caught. The mansion that the story takes place in is a bit confusing when you first started, and the map is pretty unexceptional, but after the first couple chapters youâll quickly get a hang of how itâs all laid out. Some of the optional quest objectives can be a bit tedious but the main missions are relatively easy to work your way through without feeling hopelessly stuck. The atmosphere is perfect, starting out peaceful and opulent then progressively sliding into emotional turmoil and fear. Lucius is absolutely incredible and I would recommend it to anyone.
1227	1	a	So this game is hella fun...People still say 'hella,' right? Anyways, more important than the entertainment to be had, in my opinion, is its value to achievement junkies. If you're anything like me and have difficulty getting it up for games that don't have a nice fat achievements, this game will be your mistress. I beleive this is the only game I've gotten 100% on, but I havn't been hunting on PC long, as I believed Steam lacked incentive to obtain achievements. I recently discovered the achievement percentage, and mine was 22%. Pathetic. Figured I'd start bumping it up by playing the bottom game in my library, and beleive me, my child, I picked the right one.

2366	0	a	Uninspired gameplay and graphics that are on-par with other titles but don't stand out hamper my enjoyment Homefront: The Revolution. Unfortunately, it doesn't compensate by capitalizing on its somewhat novel story: America is now subject to rule by North Korea, and you are part of an insurgency fighting them. The game tries to pass off what you're doing and people's suffering, but just fails. I never felt involved with the characters. Attempts to portray Americans in the ghettos as oppressed fell flat, just the developers trying to inject emotion. The worst were the constant radio updates from resistance members that sounded just so chipper to go out scouting when they're supposed to be pariahs suffering at the hands of this dictatorship. Ugh, just the worst.

2837	1	a	Deadly Premonition is the vieo game verson of Twin Peaks but with a supernatual twist and a japanese charm. Recomended if you like small town murder mysteries with bizzar characters and if you like the odd obscure Japanese game.
2641	1	a	Nominated for the 'Game within a game' Award.  (Review updated 11/23/2016) I first played this game many years ago on the Xbox 360. I then got it on steam from my better half.  I started to play it ( back in the day) because it looked silly.. AND at the time it got a review of 1/10 ( that has since been changed to a better score) but the game showed me it was much more than silly voice acting and odd characters.   This is a wonderful game with a deep story. VERY campy. Based around a show called Twin Peaks. Yes, there are some issues. Controller issues, things like that.. but playing the game is worth it even with the small issues.  This game is not for everyone! As i said it is very campy. Some might not understand this.( or it is not their type of humor) Try to give it a chance you might love it.   There is a mod out there to make the game easier to play ( more choices for screen size, better map and that) It is called DPfix 0.9.5 (  http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?p=438  ) be sure to get the newest one. I gave an older one by mistake and the map was so messed up.  Watch these videos to see! (I think it was the wrong one for 9 eps.. OOPS!! That was my fault. I am sorry.)

2390	1	a	  The game is good. I beat it in 8 hours during the free weekend. I would say it's worth $20 or less. My main issue with the story is the idea that North Korea is so advanced in technology and military warfare. It's almost laughable. Russians or the Chinese would have been more believable. Good game otherwise. I would give this a 6/10.
2500	1	a	I would have to say this game delivers in Storyline and that classic RPG, Baldurs Gate kind of feel. However, suffers from a very challenging combat system and lack of active pause feature. These do not detract from this game at all, but the experience would be much more enjoyable if Inquisitor had these features.

1881	0	a	  I loved the first Homefront. This sequel is a shameful attempt at continuing the series.  I've barely played it in co-op and I can already tell it suffers from some of the telltale signs of a bad game such as: -Even on Easy it's too hard (you die in a few shots, that's not easy) -VoIP with no push to talk is enabled on by default -Generic menu that looks like a Call of Duty/F2P ripoff/clone. -Generic Mission-Style coop system -Dropping my coop partner and I into combat not 5 seconds after the mission began (no time to take in mission objective or surroundings) -Guns using generic sound effects instead of the unique ones that the first Homefront presented  I suppose it's not horrible, it's just same old same old with a lot of problems. Meh. It's a really poor follow up to the original game.  
2973	1	a	It's a pretty good game despite all the crashes. I'd say 8/10.
214	0	a	  Promising upon first impressions... I customize a little character with a ton of different weapons/clothing/accessories/hair, the menus navigate well enough, and then hop into the first level... MASSIVE stuttering during most mouse movement despite pushing &gt;100FPS, movement acceleration per key press that resets on direction changes so the movement is unresponsive and incredibly clunky, mouse aim feels completely off, weapon changes and abilities often don't work while making other inputs, etc. The melee combat has no weight to it, and the shooting at least with the revolvers I chose offer some of the least satisfying gunplay I've seen in years irrespective of the stuttering.  I made it through a bad tutorial with timers for each section so you have to wait even after you've completed the objective, and a few of the levels, but when I go back to the customization and find EVERYTHING I had access to on first launch is now locked behind large exp and currency requirements, and simply entering that menu reset my character to defaults even though it stuck fine prior during the first few levels.  Judging by how the movement operates, and the hitching (almost outright freezing at times) during mouse camera movement, I have a feeling this was designed for controller despite having seemingly functional key rebinding. I'd whip out a controller and try it, but honestly f*k that, there's no way I'd want to play a 3rd-person shooter without mouse aim, so there's no point.  I remember seeing this 4 years ago during their Kickstarter campaign, and then again last year when Jim Sterling covered the first builds. The only thing I can see that has changed since is the effect when the 'mayhem level' increases, that and there's no insane stuttering likely because he used a controller. The original pitch and concept art was absolutely superb... interesting classes and abilities, fantastic style, color choice, and atmosphere... this 'released' game (minus the amount of customization options and the visuals) is as if it's still in the programming stage before even pre-Alpha, before core gameplay has been established.  It's so disappointing it's painful... so imagine how the Kickstarter backers feel about the state of this, and the fact that I just got the game and it's DLC for free from their Alienware promotion, and not the $8.29 they just sold it for in the sale two weeks ago, or the $15 they charged  4 years ago  on Kickstarter.

607	0	a	This game had me frustrated. The puzzles are sometimes stupidly hard to solve, even with clues, which will have you running up and down the hallways over and over again until you start screaming yourself red in the face. I found myself looking to the user made guides more often then I'd like to admit which left me feeling like a $3.00 hooker with a skin disorder. On the up shot, the guides were very well put together and very helpful if not a little presumptuous at times.  I don't recomend this game for anyone with attention problems which, lets face it, is most gamers. The graphics are nice and although it lacked the horror aspect, which is what I half expected when buying it, the story is fairly well written.  I didn't hate this game. I just can't bring myself to recommend it to anyone based on my experience with it. If it wasn't for the guides I would have given up on this game soon after pressing play.

2539	0	a	So you may have noticed that this game boasts a one-hundred hour playtime and I've only played this for about an hour before reviewing it. It might not make me qualified to give it a full review, but then again first impressions count for something, so kiss my â¥â¥â¥.  Here's the first hour of Inquisitor:  WELCOME TO 12TH CENTURY PROTO-ENGLAND. DEMONS ARE EVERYWHERE AND THE APOCALYPSE IS COMING. YOU'RE GONNA BE AN INVESTIGATOR, KID, SO GET YOUR â¥â¥â¥ TO HILLBRANDT. Me: â¥â¥â¥â¥ing ROCK. This is gonna be AWESOME. Hey, wait a minute - aren't there supposed to be more skills for, you know, investigating things? All I see are a bunch of proto-Baldur's Gate skills. GUARDS: HALT, INQUISITOR. WE'D LOVE TO LET YOU INTO HILLBRANDT SO YOU CAN GET TO ALL THE COOL DEMON SUMMONING STUFF. Me: Why do I shuffle like I've had The Pear permanently shoved up my â¥â¥â¥? GUARDS: NOT OUR FAULT. WE NEED YOU TO KILL TEN BATS BEFORE YOU CAN ENTER. Me: ...what. GUARDS: YOU WANT IN OR NOT? Me: ...fine. (SHUFFLES OFF TO KILL BATS)  (TWENTY MINUTES LATER)  Me: You â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s! You lied to me! This is just a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ier Diab -  GUARDS: You missed one. Me: ...â¥â¥â¥â¥. Back in a moment.  (TEN MINUTES LATER) Me: You â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s! You lied to me! This is just a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ier Diablo! GUARDS: YOU HAVE COMPLETED THY QUEST, AND CAN ENTER HILLBRANDT. Me: â¥â¥â¥â¥ you! CITIZENS OF HILLBRANDT: (LOUD WALL OF MUMBLING) Me: What? I can't hear you. All of your dialogue is being funneled through a small box in the center of my screen. CITIZENS OF HILLBRANDT: (MUMBLING INTENSIFIES) Me: Jesus God, someone actually took the time to write and translate all this. How do I get out of this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ user interface? I don't care if the game started development in 1999, I need more real estate for all this dialogue! CITIZENS OF HILLBRANDT: (MUMBLING NOT UNLIKE A LOUD 185 DECIBEL ROAR) Me: â¥â¥â¥â¥ HELP I'M DROWNING SAVE ME GUARDS: WE NEED YOU TO KILL SOME MORE BATS  So if you want me to review the other 99 hours of this game, please feel free to contact me in order to set up a payment plan. Because cash dollars are the only reason I would ever consider booting up this â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game again. That or if I run out of sleeping pills.

295	1	a	Meh, I have mixed feelings about the game. As much as I feel playing as the Son of The Devil, I cannot stop feeling this game is a little bit boring, after some of the few chapters. What makes it playable is the killings, and the end is climatic as Hell.  Get in on a sale day - itÂ´s a game to play and finish during a weekendÂ´s time, if you are into satanic stuff or if you despise the Abrahamic religions.
1350	1	a	Reminds me of GTA 1. That's a good thing. Good controller support. Fun, totally mindless. Worth the voucher price, easy.
2016	0	a	I bought this game because I liked the other homefront and I thought the trailers looked pretty cool. I downloaded the game and started playing, everything was fine until I beat the tutorial and actually started combat, Aiming feels akward, almost like your mouse is lagging and when you actually fire your weapon the recoil is very hard to manage, I'm not sure if this is intentional or not but either way it makes the experience suffer. Another thing that was unsatifactory was driving, I couldn't make any turns without crashing into walls and there was absolutley no way I could go up ramps (It was like driving a car in Hatred). Considering that those two things are major mechanics of the game it threw off the entire experince and I ended up refunding the game. However I will say that it had a few good parts; the graphics looked very nice (Although I feel like the devs put more time into them than the actual game mechanics) and the hacking bit that you could do with your phone was pretty cool too. Overall I'm extremely dissapointed

Controls could be better, just don't play on keyboard.  All around 8/10 so far, guess in the end will be 11/coffee 
2589	1	a	Honestly, I was surprised at how much I liked this game. I knew people had mixed views on it before playing, but I was not expecting the amazingly original storyline and surprise ending. If you think you're going to like this game even a little bit, it will probably surpass your expectations. Once you get it working, the awful port becomes just another quirk of this oddly satisfying game.

488	0	a	I bought the game while it was on sale for $5.49, I played through the entire game to see how it turned out, but it is the most twisted, f***ed up game I have ever seen... I mean you can   mind control someone into killing themself by jamming a cross into their face over and over  ... It is a VERY Linear story, so you must do at least 90% of the things only one way(with no direction from the game as to how to do these things, IE: wiki will help a lot), but for the other 10% its more or less do you want them to kill themselves violently, or very violently...

1480	1	a	I bought HF:TR for only 11$ in the Steam sale, I must say it is a great game. This game has on my rig pretty good optimization (AMD RX480). I play on 1080p with almost always 60 FPS on the highest settings.  The graphic is great. CryEngine really delivers it. The sound as well.  The plot is nice and the characters in the game are interesting, but it is not more than decent.  The gameplay is very similiar to Farcry gameplay: open world shooting game where you need to unlock outposts (or any other way you want to call it) and have a main missions that you can do.  The game is pretty easy as well.  in the end I think you should buy this game in a sale. it is a decent fun game. DONT BUY FOR CO OP! CO OP SUCKS â¥â¥â¥!

2552	1	a	This is the type of game that will only excite people who get into the characters and story. In concept the game itself is fantastic, but technical flaws narrows the overall appeal to an already niche title. I loved the game, but I feel it's only fair to recommend it with some caveats.  It's a murder mystery with quirky characters. They give the game a lot of heart and fans of the TV show Twin Peaks and 80s pop culture should find some things to love. The juxtaposition of horror and comedy is something special.  Basically this is an open world survival horror game where you drive around and look for clue to further the story. If I remember correctly there are 50 side quests as well. I really liked that many prizes for completing side quests were useful (unlike many open world games). You normally travel by car which is a jarring, experience. The car controls very poorly and has a blind spot where the frame of the windshield is. Opening the large map takes up half the screen and does not display all of the information that the menu map does. As bad as it all sounds, you do get used to it, and fast travel options open up with the right side quest completion. I would say the driving was my biggest peeve.  The combat is familiar to anyone who has played Resident Evil 4 or Dead Space. The controls are a stiffer than expected in the previously mentioned games and aiming is not as easy. There is some required melee combat and all weapons break after a few uses. I was ok with this considering that it's a survival horror game. I never was weaponless during my playthrough. there is not a lot of enemy variation though so be ready to hear 'noooo i dooon't want to dieeee!' about over 9000 times.  Though Deadly Premonition still contains a fair amount of jank, it only adds to the wealth of charm within. The end result is a ridiculously original masterpiece that hearkens back to an era where the gaming landscape had more room for wildly imaginative budget games, a far cry from the abundance of focus tested blockbusters that are prevalent today.   I love whistling this theme!         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Deadly Premonition (Whistle Theme)&nbsp;

3100	1	a	A surprisingly long game (I spent about 13 hours filling out 90% of everything). It's a exploration heavy metroidvania which is pretty puzzle based. This game has an incredibly expansive map that you explore and the more you play the more lore you uncover. It's really interesting.  If you like exploring, lore, depth, completing all sorts of quests, and other stuff, this game is for you. If you like fast paced gameplay, action, short games, and instant gratification, then it is not.   ALSO this game should NOT be rated M. It's only rated M because there's a little bit of language but that's it. It would have been E if there was none of that.

1968	1	a	Very Fun. Much improved over the original Homefront. Liked the weapon mod system. Enjoyed the game so much it pre-empted BF1 and Civ 6, even though it is not comparable. Did not try the multiplayer. It has an easy storyline, and less linear progression. I recommend this game.
639	0	a	This is my revew on Lucius and I have to give it a 4/10 because there are bugs and alot of them and thats not really a bad thing because only one is game breaking and thats only happens for in my words the better ending. As for the other bugs they just break the immersion of the game. Also at almost random the frame rate would heavaly drop to almost a frame per second and everything would come to a crawl. Also the game has a hard time at really telling you what you really need to do and at times I had to use Youtube to finish some chapters because of how poorly the game told me on what i had to do.  On the other hand the game is kinda boring 'unless if you like games like this' the cutscenes are well done, and for the most part the voice acting is good. Sadly I really cant recommend this game unless its on sale because in a way the game gets you to kinda want to kill off the people in it other then your mother, your first victim, and the butler other then that the people you kill kinda had it coming.
1362	1	a	I don't like zombie games and really can't remember why I bought this. You can choose between survival, racing or story mode.  Unlock cars and upgrades for those. You can pick up weapon mods like miniguns, rockets, flamethrower or a railgun. Partly destructible environment like picket fences, streetlights and parking cars.  Get mission rewards and achievements depending on your performance. Over hundred achievements and a six card set. 7/ 10

930	1	a	Every were that Lucius walks death follows of corse when people start to be murdered no one points to a child. This charming young evil child has captivated my soul hes almost to cute to say no to. his handsome father (the devil) almost makes me want to sell my soul to him. though i dout the devil has ever look so handsome in a game correct me if im wrong. Lucius will make your sick little devil love heart come out this game almost feels like it was made for me. The sick and twisted way that Lucius thinks is almost to much to for my girl hood.   This boy pulls off murders better than most real life adults. This boy is what nightmares are made of.  though i only have nice things to say. i spoiled the game for my self by watching someone play this and the seconed one but there so good &lt;3  
1266	1	a	Ive finished the main story now. Almost a good game... Some fun, but the Cut Scenes are the MOST ANNOYING I have EVER seen. You cant skip them, even when repeating a mission. I cant believe that they would put such a stupid restriction on the game (and from what I have heard, they WILL NOT change it, despite many complaints). They are TERRIBLE. The voice acting is poor (it comes across as cheesy / fun the first time or two), and the cut scenes ruin the pace of the game. Not to mention the stupid difficulty changes in each mission. And Im SICK AND TIRED of every â¥â¥â¥â¥ing mission being timed in one way or another. Create a game that is potentially fun, then not allow you to actually enjoy it (except in other game modes maybe). Would have gotten an 8/10, but I have to give it a 6... it does its best to ruin the long term (replayable) enjoyment of the game.

1970	0	a	  Updated/removed original review  The concept of Homefront, the IP itself, is a great idea and itâs something fresh. I feel like everytime this name gets used itâs already tainted because the original game had issues during development but not to the same extent this game went through.  There are sooo many issues with the game I cannot simply go through them all, the game felt rushed and was simply an unfinished AAA title. This isnât acceptable at all.  Even after being completely aware of the issues the game has, they even mislead the consumer in the 1.4 patch by saying and I quoteâ¦    âSave Stallsâ We have optimized the number of checkpoint save locations throughout the single player campaign. This means that the short âpausesâ that the player encounters are reduced and the game will now inform you that it is saving.â    How can you sit there and say that you fixed save stalls when the game stalls/stutters get worse the deeper into the campaign you get?  I do want to ask, it is great that you finished a project but why did you accept it as is? I cannot understand how this was accepted by Deep Silver as a final build or a finished product?

1679	1	a	the main game is great fun to play and there is plenty of a atmosphere in the occupied city where the game takes place. Plenty of exploring to be done, constantly avoiding the searchlights of the Blimps that loom overhead.  the linear DLC's are in my opinion not worth playing if you really enjoy the open world part of this game.

If you like Far Cry, Mad Max, Crysis, Stalker this game is probably for you.  If you try this game out do not be discouraged by the bad and boring start, wait until you at least get into the yellow (civilian zone) after an hour or two since that is the real deal and makes the game what it is.  Ran without bugs, very smooth.

Select from 10 different heroes (Assassins [specialise in taking out enemy heroes] and Generals [specialise in supporting friendly forces and commanding your own units]) each with unique skill trees and abilities, and each with a different playing style. Go stealth/critical damage, ranged caster, close combat disruptor or otherwise, any character will offer you a challenging experience. Only a handful of maps and game modes to choose from, but don't be alarmed; it doesn't get boring if you play multiplayer. Optional community mods available to crank up the gameplay, too, if that's your thing. All around, just awesome *****

Don't immediately believe what people are saying, go have a look at some of the lets plays and decide for yourself.

Pros -  Looks gorgeous at max settings Long campaign compaired to most popular fps games Maps are a nice size good atmosphere Rich backstory The interchangeable weapon system is cool changing Attachments on the fly   Cons -  not enough story element imo not enough characted development weapon selection is kinda limited  AI is a little basic the stealth mechanics need a little work Not totally open world  Some good, some bad but all in all a very enjoyable game. Not nearly as bad as most are making it out to be. Though i suppose thats the curse of homefront the first game was hated on when it was relesed but i found it was a solid game and really enjoyed it same as with this instalment.

Demigod is often overlooked but it a great game that bring a MOBA style to solo and LAN play, no internet connection required. Even better the DLC is such that you can use one copy and let everyone on the LAN play together.

1972	1	a	Steam is currently mixed about this game, and so am I. It has some great elements and some godawful elements to it, which balance it out to the point of... being mixed.  The guns and gear are very satisfying to use, but the UI can be infuriatinly unintuitive at times.  There are good maps, plenty to explore but after a while it starts to feel repetitive. Combined with a 'hearts and minds' mechanic in the game (where you have to win the hearts and minds of the citizens for the next stage of your revolution) which is also infuritatinly slow, this reached the point of boredom - note that there's a difference between patience and boredom, and this particular mechanic managed to stretch that patience.   I managed to force myself to slog through this but I had simply stopped caring, all the fun was sucked out.   From what I'm reading, this is a formula similar to the Far Cry series - so if you like that kind of mechanic you probably won't mind this. The good bit is that I have learned that I should be avoiding Far Cry!   The story is poor and at times feels extended for the sake of extending it. The characters involved are... morons... with no clear purpose or goal, who have no idea what they are doing. The ending was OK.   With all of this mixed it's really difficult to say. If you're looking for a story, stay away from this one. If you're looking for exploration and good gear, then have a look - but be prepared to understand what you're getting into.

2476	1	a	Inquisitor is an unpolished diamond. When playing a game of its genre, I expect it to have a compelling story and an immersive atmosphere. Gameplay always comes second. It certainly has hack&amp;slash elements and it could very well be categorized as such. However, it feels like a true old school rpg to me since its emphasis lies on lore, storyline and mood. You almost feel like you were tossed in this world and have to choose, heavy hearted, for the lesser evil. The devil you know. Or not...
2229	1	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOVx2sek-ME    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-SNjPbL0tE&amp;feature=youtu.be   This is an acceptable game but not good game. The graphics are amazing because the devs were smart enough to use the cry engine which kills ue4 or id4 for me personally having issues with the other two engines with other games.  The good:  Price compared to other AAA titles Intro is outstanding Graphics are amazing. There is story building and interesting cutscenes and dialogue compared to the crap that is thrown to us these days where the only goal is to make a quick buck. The sound is great and i like the background music creating mood. Drove a motorcycle.  The bad:  I have come across several issues where the last check point save would bring me back to the wrong place. Also in the first mission at one point it would not trigger that it was actually completed and stuck sort of in a loop.  Gameplay feels like Far Cry to be honest. Use the transceiver to discover items in a map. Parts of the map you would capture your team would move to. There is an armory.  Weponary seems basic and limited to weapons made of scrap kind of like metro because of the limited resources your faction/resistance group has.  I found AI to be quite dumb in most situations where they would just run at you and I easily killed 3 guys that walked in a row without sneaking on them. Sometimes i was surprised that the AI used grenades when I was hidden or would shoot me through a window when i passed by. Therefore there is some balancing to be done. Ai system felt like the one in gta when there are 1-5 police stars because at one point there seems to be a bunch of them that spawns somewhere if you create too much havoc and an aircraft shows up so need to gtfot.  This games needs a patch to be good but now it is acceptable.  I have no graphics problem and I have 3.9ghz 4700k intel and an old r7 2gd plus 24gig of ram and runs perfect so I do not know what the complaints are about.

Is Zombie Driver Hd on sale? You should definitely buy this game.  This game offers hours of gameplay and satisfying content.
2087	0	a	What a miserable game! Terrible in performance, terrible in story, terrible in execution. I have a famously low tolerance for bad open-world games, but this tested even my virtue; it's so bad. Real bad. Don't buy bad. Maybe at less than $10 on sale, but even that's iffy; this game has very little redeeming features. The story is frustratingly horrible at the start, the gameplay is uneven and just poorly laid out in the beginning. Ugh. And the performance on a GTX 970 is close to vomit-inducing; I've neverplayed a game that made me have to turn it down to keep from hurling until now.

2668	1	a	This game is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing art masterpiece!  So many feelings - it just puts you in right away with all the characters and atmosphere. Lots of laughter, drama, many wtf moments, challenging gameplay, beautiful cinematics and a decent dosage of a cry... One of a kind game, it will go down in the history as one of the most â¥â¥â¥â¥'d up, dramatistic, humoristic and unique games of all time...  A great example that you don't need perfect graphics or gameplay to make a great game, it's all about the originality and creativity, all the bugs n â¥â¥â¥â¥ made this game to what it is!  And yeah, animations &amp; dialogues are â¥â¥â¥â¥ing golden, this â¥â¥â¥â¥ should be nominated for an Oscar! Zach &amp; Francis York Morgan, Max Payne and Alan Wake - perfect combination! :D

2684	1	a	Despite having no right to be, this is one of my favourite games. It's utterly bizarre but I love it to bits. Please play it. It's a weird gem with some utterly horrible gameplay but it is somehow special.
2479	1	a	So I must admit this game is pretty hardcore. I also must admit I had to cheat in order to stay alive as a thief.  But!  I love Inquisitor's atmosphere, with it's foggy lands and superstitions. All this writing work really keeps me going! It has quite a unique lore, and for some reason I don't get, the old fashioned design really fits it. I also like some of the musics. This game inspires me!  I don't know if I'll ever be able to finish it, but I'll try my best. It's not every day you get to be a badass inquisitor.

665	0	a	I really anticipated this game ever since it was first announced. I waited for it to be released. And then it did, and the reviews were not kind. I thought I will still like it, until I started the game. 19 minutes later I wrote this review.  It was the most boring opening I have ever seen. The background music was the most uninspired I have ever heard. The voice acting was jarring at best. Stiff and emotionless. The writing lies somewhere between banal and cliche, at times unapologetically indifferent, or unapologetically dumbass, for the lack of a better word. A woman died and the police concluded it was heart attack, and the detective who just arrived concurred, stating that it was typical of women her age, before he even set foot into the house. That was all I could take before I shut down the game.  Controls were unintuitive. Explanations were a mystery in itself. I spent 3 minutes trying to figure out how to use a lock when you don't have a way to select it even when you see it on screen. In the previous step, the game told you to pick it up, then it instructed you to 'holster' it. Then the game asked you to use it, without explaining that you need to 'unholster' it before you can use it. Brilliant.   In the 19 minutes that I have played the game, I have probably played it for 5 minutes. I spent the other 14 waiting for the game to load, watching slow moving cutscenes that tells you what you already know, listening to words that hardly inspires, instill fear, or peak my interest in any way. It was more interesting watching paint dry.  Also, instead of opting for a first person perspective, the developers wanted to replicate a movie feel and go third person instead. I know, they are trying to recreate the tricycle scene of The Shinning, but ever wondered how awkward it is to control someone in-game like that? And that's not to mention how they always have to center the camera looking directly at Lucius, who admittedly looked creepy in the game. It's a wonder then, how no one suspected him.  Do I recommend this game? No. Will I continue to play it till the end? No. Will I buy Lucius II? No. Should you play this game? Depends. If you are patient and don't care about quality as much, you may enjoy it. If you are critical like I am, you will balk at the notion that this game was even made.

1800	0	a	I was really excited when Homefront:the revolution was announced as an open world game. I didn't play the first game in the series more than a few hours for a plethora of reasons. I even waited when reviews were somewhat spotty at best on this game. This new itteration of the Homefront series has some good quirks and some bad. Let's start with the pros shall we? On the list of pros Homefront presents a somewhat large open world for you to bring freedom to. It seems to breathe, it seems to move and be legitimately animated. When I first started playing I was absorbed into the world and excited to explore it. The next pro would definitely be the weapons. Although there isn't a large variety to be had with this game, what it does let you have are a few archetypes that can be customized to your liking (pistol, shotgun, assault rifle, sniper rifle) and each of these weapons has a feeling that it is scrounged up and hastily put together for a fight with a better equipped enemy. There is also crafting of implements of destruction here as well, mostly just your run of the mill grenades, molotovs, mines... and then you also have a few cool rc bombs and drones at your disposal. I feel like these are the main things the game does really well. On the bad side however I will open up to a list of the cons. The game feels rushed , even with the patches out for it so far (6-7ish months after release). Framerat can stutter at times even on a higher end rig. There is also the problem of render distance for the ai. I've seen many times in game where enemy ai can just suddenly disappear, even while you are looking at them. As you can imagine this hinders players who like to use sniping as their main playstyle. This has even happened up close in many tight quarters firefights. Next up is the gunplay, now to me , the gunplay can seem very blocky and almost robotic feeling. It's nice to have interesting tools of the trade, but if they all feel very robotic or almost clunky to operate that takes away part of the fun of having them. One of the final cons I'm going to touch on is the fact that the ai is very poor. The enemy ai seems to be able to predict where you are at instantaniously and almost without warning at all. They also seem to be able to hit you as soon as you start engaging them, I have very rarely been missed by an ai ever in this game. The health system does little to nothing to help this as when you are playing on the hardest difficulty , if you get hit once you're already dead pretty much. That wouldn't be a big deal if the ai weren't all competition grade shooters. Anyways, if you are looking for a fix on an insurgant like game. I suggest you pick up a game like Red Faction Guerilla instead. I had such high hopes for this game and was disappointed by what I had actually recieved.
116	1	a	This game is a great play for passing time. You know LOL and Dota well how about trying out Demigod. Sadly for every MLG wanna be there is no such thing for this game like there is in LOL and Dota
2079	0	a	Like many others here, I have also had preformance issues. I well exceed the recommended specs, and it runs awfully. The game looks amazing for the most part, but what good is a sweet looking game if it runs like total crap. Maybe future patches will further optimize and improve frame rates, but as it stands right now it's unplayable for me.
869	1	a	Overall, I enjoyed Lucius and the funny moments that arose when I played it. I thoroughly enjoyed the cutscenes that roll after each kill. It did glitch (cutscene wouldn't activate) for me in the last chapter, but other then that my gameplay experience was smooth sailing. If you're not a fan of games with linear and restricting gameplay then this isn't the game for you. Most of your time is spent looking for items to kill your target with. Also, unlike Hitman which i've seen this game compared to there is only one way to kill each target. The puzzles for the most part are pretty straight forward, and not much of a challenge. After the first couple of kills it gets a little repetitive. Nonetheless, I enjoyed my time in the world of Lucius, and do not regret my purchase. If this game is on sale I would highly recommend picking it up.
59	1	a	If you love DOTA, LOL, or any of those arena style games you'll enjoy this one! I just wish that they'd make a sequel.
1694	0	a	I used to recommend this game until about two weeks ago when they gave us a 2GB 'patch' taht â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up the rendering of the world. That 'patch' was just sjilling out their new DLC, so i guess you can see where the devs' priorites lay. Also there should be NO graphical issues (running GTX 1070 and i5 6600k).
1022	1	a	This game is one of my favorites, now that I have played it, and completed it in about 9-10 hours. I got it when it was on sale before Lucius 2 came out, and I'm so glad it was on sale and I had found it. No regrets on buying it, but now that it's no longer on sale as of right now, anyone interested in getting the game at the normal price, don't question it, you won't regret it. Especially if you love to kill people for no real reason, creepy demonic stuff, and I do enjoy the most in this game, because some parts are a little confusing, trying to figure out exactly what to do [or how to kill the person] that it will put that person on a 'repeated' schedule in the game until you figure out what you need to do, so you don't need to rush or panic that you can't figure it out for a while. I highly recommend!

286	0	a	Unfortunately, a game that looked so promising, turned out to be far from that. Lucius is a very simplistic point and click game that offers very little immersion, gameplay or anything else. The puzzles are mundane, if you can call them puzzles. You can complete the story in maybe 2 or 3 hours, if you can stand it for that long. The game offers no replayability and there are quite a lot of bugs around.  Avoid.
110	1	a	Anybody who is into DOTA/League of Legends is going to pick up this game very quickly. On the positive side of the differences are going to be that there are many more maps &amp; game modes than DOTA/LoL provide. Outside of the items/equipment you can purchase in the game, you can also purchase upgrades for your structures, towers &amp; creeps. Skill trees are much more detailed &amp; allow for more possibilities than the normal 4-skill loadout that DOTA/LoL offers. Another thing that is offered is the ability to rotate your map, which is something that hasn't been offered by DOTA/LoL, yet. There are also a couple single player modes which is something that DOTA was never able to do &amp; LoL only allows in custom matches. On the negative side of the differences, playable characters are rather limited. If you'd like to try before you buy, there is a demo you can try out.

2879	1	a	This is, hands down, my favorite 360 game from 2010. It started development as a PS2 game, and still looks and plays pretty much like a PS2 game.   Unfortunately it also isn't the best port. It has controller support, but there are some weird issues with the triggers that gets kind of annoying. Also at times your framerate will drop to single digits and the only way to fix it is to restart your PC, so that's weird.  But basically it's a Japanese take on David Lynch's Twin Peaks, just put into a videogame. The characters are eccentric and endearing, and the mystery and presentation of the story is actually pretty engaging. The shooting and driving isn't so great, but the game has so much god damn heart it's hard to be upset at it.

640	1	a	+good storyline +cinematic insertions +interesting achievements -a very hard game for those who are not familiar with the genre 'quest' -booring gameplay  -a lot of bugs but I recommend it
3046	1	a	If you like exploration in games then you will love this one. A ridiculously large map to explore, with every screen looking unique and interesting. The music is consistently wonderful. The gameplay is a lot of fun too, with the ability to turn into a bouncy ball at will. It makes for a lot of cool puzzles, some of which are very tricky. However, the game is generally as difficult as you want it to be. If you can't get past a certain screen you can usually backtrack and find a different route. Also, loads and loads of secrets! The story, themes, and characters can be a bit polarizing, but I think they are very well done, and you can really tell Nifflas put his heart and soul into this game. In my opinion there's only one thing wrong with this game: It's slow to get going. The first two chapters are maybe an hour long each and are more like tutorials than anything else. They don't give a great impression of the full game and I feel like that first impression drives some people away. But please, just keep playing. Chapter 3 is amazing.

1220	1	a	So far I've only played through a few hours of the story mode so this review relates to that. I'm looking forward to trying race mode later.  I always have a nostalgic hankering for a decent top down driving game but am usually disappointed. Zombie Driver HD however is fantastic fun.. Rich environments much of which you can destroy, engaging story, awesome voice acting (in the best B movie tradition), convincing hoards that can swamp you if you're careless, great explosive visual effects, quality audio and HUGE zombie bodycounts.  While you are required to develop a certain amount of driving skill it should'nt be too frustrating for novices of the top down style. missions can be completed at a slower pace, sticking to the streets but don't worry about leaving the road, the maps are sensibly designed so you don't constantly get stuck on scenery or in dead ends. As you become skilled with the handbrake you'll be pulling donuts and rail gunning through hundreds of bloody undead.  The different vehicles work well and purchaseable upgrades mean you're always tempted to stray from the mission to grab extra cash found around the city.  The atmosphere created in the game is great, weather changes, night time lighting, the army presence, shadows of jet fighters roaring overhead, vehicle getting covered in blood and a constant tension created by time critical mission elements all add the feel of this great little game.  One thing I would like added is the ability to move the camera a little to scan the environment. Playing with an xbox controller this seems untuitively what the second stick should be used for, although it's arguable that you shouldn't be able to see much further than the street you're driving in.  So in my opinion the developers have done a great job of creating a top down driving game set in a zombie apocalypse, if that sounds like something you need, you should probably grab it in a sale like I did, or at full price if you're feeling flush.  FUN.

3	1	a	This game is really well designed and has very high production values. All around a well polished game with great graphics and soundtrack. For instance, the opening movie sequence was voiced by the actor, Christopher Lee, known for his roles as Dracula and the evil wizard, Sauron, in Lord of the Rings.  The initial learning curve is a little steep without strong tutorial missions, but persistent players will be rewarded with hours of fun. I recommend playing against the computer bots on easy mode, and if possible, get a friend to play co-op with you against the bots. You won't be disappointed.  Demigod is something of a sleeper hit that may have been overshadowed by the likes of League of Legends (LOL) and Defense of the Ancients (DOTA 1 and DOTA 2). However, this game is just so cool when you have a friend to play with.  Keg gives Demigod four thumbs up!
2550	1	a	I wish there was a one thumb up, one thumb down rating; or a shoulder shrug or something for somewhere in-between a 'Yes' or 'No' Recommendation for these Steam-game Ratings.  RECOMMENDED - for the actual game experience: fantastic. NOT RECOMMENDED - for the awful PC technical port: horrible.  Before I actually even get into what an outstanding actual gem of a game itself, let's start right up front with this:  *****WARNING!************  *****BUYER BEWARE!*****  While Deadly Premonition is a unique + outstanding game, it is such a crime that this game is riddled with technical disaster after technical disaster here on the PC. In terms of technical disasters on the PC, this is right down there with the likes of Bully PC version + Dark Souls PTD PC. While Dark Souls: PTD was at least very functional before even modding, Deadly Premonition is absolutely NOT. This is a very basic PC port, lacking of many of the typical PC features we're accustomed to. First off: the game is locked in 720p, so nevermind any sort of 1080p support. Don't expect any sort of fancy graphics bells + whistles officially, either. Durante's DPFix Mod is going to be a must for PC gamers here, if they have any sort of higher-end monitors + graphics cards; especially if they want to bump the resolution past 720p + even make this aging game look a bit more modern.   Also, the game has crazy-issues with crashing to the desktop (CTD) frequently. You might want to even run a LAA (Large Address Awareness) program to make the game force using 4GB of RAM (since it runs even more horribly, without it), since this game has performance issues where it'll begin at 60 FPS (frames per second) when you start, eventually winding up - slowly, but surely - to a crawl. And if the game hasn't hit a crawl yet and crashed, give it time - it likely will. Saving constantly for most gamers anytime you get a chance will likely be a must.  While I did not try using KB-mouse, the game was a console-game: so, it was built around a gamepad. While you can change the controls configuration in the game's sart-up config/splash-screen for the gamepad, you're better off not doing so - b/c some keys might not even function properly, if moved elsewhere.   ****END OF BUYER BEWARE SECTION***  Now, onto the actual game itself...  What do you get when you cross an open-world game, a surreal David Lynch movie/TV show, survival-horror games (Resident Evil + Silent Hill series), and numerous brutal detective movies involving ritualistic murders (i.e. the movie Seven)? You get Deadly Premonition, one of the strangest, odded, weirdest, unique + most interesting games of this era. If any game has 'cult classic' written all over it in this era, this game would certainly easily fit the bill. Also, this game is a flawed-gem + an absolute diamond in the rough in numerous ways, if I've ever seen one.  The story + plot goes like this: Francis 'York' Morgan (who the player is, BTW) is a FBI Agent that comes to the small town of Greenvale, in an attempt to try to solve a bunch a murders occurring from what looks to be a serial killer. I don't want to spoil too much more + go off into the deep end here, as this is just the tip of the iceberg with this game's story, plot + characters; since this stuff should be experienced by the player, first-hand.  And boy, are there characters in this game! Most of the characters in this game do have something that make them stick-out in their own way, as either unique, bizarre, different, hilarious, ridiculous, or God knows what. The colorful cast of characters is always interesting + intriguing: for example, the lead 'York' talks to himself a lot, and refers to someone named 'Zach'; and there is a character that's filthy rich, wearing a gas mask and having his assistant speak in rhyme and poetically. Characters don't get often as unique, interesting, eccentric, hilarious (whether intentional, not intentional, or who knows on some occassions) than often what Deadly Premonition has on display here.   The story + plot are also no stranger from this type of insanity, madness and colorful-ness, as well. While the plot starts off with a typical detectives are out to 'catch the serial killer theme,' it doesn't take long to eventually graduates into something much more weird, interesting, strange, unique, bizarre - and then eventually go way off into the deep end, by the time the game finally finishes. Gamers will no doubt be replaynig the game; looking at an analysis online (or two, or three, or more); and having debates with their friends about things they couldn't figure out + things that are purposely left hanging ambiguously.  The controls and gameplay feels like it's right out of other classic survival-horror games. Think of the control-pad approach for Resident Evil 4 (especially since you can't move when you aim) - and you have the right idea. Combat always feels like it should with a controller: it feels solid. Areas often have their own 'Nightmare' version of an area, which feels like it's plucked right out of a Silent Hill game. There are even QTE (Quick-Time Events) in this game here and there, though this game doesn't really hammer you over the head with them, unlike some other games (i.e. Fahrenheit AKA Indigo Prophecy).  Players, by performing main-quests and side-quests, can make money - all so that they can buy more guns, melee weapons, ammo, med-kits, and other things to keep them on their journey Some quests, they can only be taken during a certain time of day - so, you might miss quests if you don't do them where they're placed in a game's Chapter or during a certain time of day. This could cause fans to replay the game, to see and experience more on an actual replay of the game. Quests varying from racing to get someone or something to another area; playing darts on a board; to just talking to NPC's and trying to get information out of them. That just doesn't tip the iceberg here, of what this game has on offer - as the game is constantly keeping the player immersed into the game, the world, the story, and especially the characters.  The game certianly lacks a lot of polish, in many areas. Sometimes, the game's sound effect doesn't sound strong, when hitting an enemy with a weapon. Sometimes, the dialogue isn't that juicy or great; while other times, it's fantastic. The quality of the graphics are nothing to write home about here, as it looks like a game that maybe should've been released on the PC years ago and/or this new version should've been updated with modern resolution support (1080p and above) + graphical features. Worst of all - as I've already stated, this game is an absolute technical mess, in terms of how this PC port was handled.  Deadly Premonition is a flawed-gem + a cult-classic, unfortunately riddled with having of the worst PC ports that I've ever seen - but it's an absolutely unforgettable experience, once you can everything in working order...hopefully, for the time being. It's a great gaming experience, when it's working. An experience that, per playthrough, likely will take the player 15-20 hours or so - if we're not counting all the crashes, frustrations, and other technical blunders that might cause the spike in the time-played. According to Steam, I had around 32 hours with this, if you count all of that madness; while the game itself had me clocked in around almost 20 hours. Unfortunately, this great game is brought down quite a bit because it's unfortunately riddled with an abysmal F-grade of a technical PC port - to the point that even mods can't even close to fix most of this game's technical mess. Even the absymal PC port couldn't stop me from trying to finish this fantastic game.  Game Experience = A PC Port = F. FINAL Overall Grade = C.

3040	1	a	 Tldr: One of the best games I played of all time.  This game is really well made, you have awesome character development, an extremly fitting art style and background music which makes you feel comfortable and the map of Knytt Underground is  huge  and got  tons  of secrets. The gameplay mechanic is innovative and after you got a hang of the controls you can involve your surroundings in your gameplay. Completing the main story of the game will take you about 6 hours, but you really want to miss out all the sidequests, additional characters, secret challenges, several ending and and and.  If you want to have an atmospheric and relaxing experience, try out Knytt, you will not regret it.

An oddly budget feeling, good way indeed. :P  I want to start this recommendation off with the major strength of this game and what will have you coming back despite the flawed gameplay and that is the story. You play as Fracis York Morgan, 'But please, just call me York. That's what everyone calls me.' Is the main character of the game who came to a small town to investigate a supernatural murder case and try to solve the mystery of why his most recent cases all have red seeds in them and where they are coming from.  The small town is filled with a pretty diverse set of characters and I think thatâs the biggest strength in this game. Itâs interesting to hear what they have to say and what kind of odd or oddly humorous things they have to say.  The gameplay, as stated earlier? Yep, itâs quite flawed haha. The controls feel a little clunky and the aiming takes a while to get used to and donât flow as smoothly as for example Resident Evil 4 or 5. The worst offender in the gameplay though? The vehicles. There is a small open town to drive around and the camera can give you motion sickness due to a bug that they never fixed in this port... For example, when you turn your car to the left? The camera pans slightly to the right and vise-versa. It messes with your brain and I found for the first few hours that yes, I was getting headaches or even a little nauseous as youâd expect the camera to pan in the same direction of the vehicle.  Second? The vehicles physics are some kind of weird mix between Mafia 1âs and those budget games youâd find on a rack at a gas station. Vehicles constantly clip in the ground when taking the exploratory paths, taking some corners too fast cause your vehicle to flip way too easily as if the weight of the vehicle is non-existent in this calculation and the engine sounds can sometimes be quite annoying.  So yeahâ¦ vehicles? Definitely the worst part of the game. They will annoy the crap out of you. In the PS2 era this game came out? We had good arcade vehicle physics from the likes of GTA 3 as a prime example of how they should have gone about it. But? I donât know the development cycle and I donât know their budget (which feels VERY tight btw) so this may have been an area that they didnât focus inâ¦ but at least they should have fixed the damn camera pan when they made this PC port. :P Oh, one warning about this port? It can be quite unstable. As nice as it is you get bonus points for remembering to use phones (to manually save your game) there are times you will get screwed over especially during side-missions where the game will crash and cost you time if you donât saveâ¦ so itâs up to you if you wish to use manual or auto saving (toggled in the options menu).  There are guides out there to resolving this, but I found using either Windows XP SP3 compatibility mode or Windows Vista (no service packs) got me through the full game along with this precompiled mod setup found here:  http://www.gog.com/forum/deadly_premonition_directors_cut/essentail_mods   Hope this helpsâ¦ so says, Mr. Stuart. ;)
1366	1	a	Such a simple game and idea yet had rediculous amounts of fun playing this game. You can rack up hours playing this and not notice the time go by. I think it will be a game compared to marmite but I love marmite and loved this! Must have in your library.

501	1	a	Good game. Teaches you how to kill in a lot of ways. Has some one or two NSFW and really horrendous achievement system.  Really? An Achievement for playing the game for 20 and 40 hours? One can finish this under 3 hours. I played about 5 hours maybe. Some hours I was AFK. I didn't skip cutscenes and took my time. I can't see how one could play this for 20 or 40 hours. It has a good story but after that you're definitely finished. Not so much repeatability.  But overall, good game.   This has been bundled SEVERAL times. Don't get this at full price. Find a trade or get this on a sale.

2112	1	a	Im 4 hours in and so far I like it. Ive done time on both single and multiplayer. There is a brutal occupation going on, and you get to go out into urban areas to blow people's heads off. The graphics are great, the bugs are just like every other game, and the controls and game mechanics are the same as far cry ... which is why I like this game so much. I loved blood dragon, and this is its meaner, grittier cousin. I give it 4 out of 5 stars. Higher to 4.5 if the modding community gets ahold of it for episodic multiplayer events. Sooner or later someone will mod some zombies, but maybe something new will be out there this time for these â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Norks.  *9 hrs in and the game keeps getting better. I can see why people that only invested 10 mins give horrible reviews. The first mission takes awhile, so it will soil the experience for some.
520	0	a	Near as bad as Anna. Congrats! Could have been a good game. But a LOT of little details come and screw the game. Plain history, unsuprising ending .... Sadly, forget it.
2760	1	a	Legendary game.  Twin Peaks, if interpreted by an unrestricted Japanese developer. Itâs a mystery-adventure game, not exactly a horror title. I'd say it shares more with Shenmue than Silent Hill. The cast of the game and their interactions provide for some of the most memorable game moments. Unfortunately gameplay, in terms of combat, lacks polish and will be considered abysmal by some.  If you want something different, a game that provides something far from Ubisoft's triple-a game dispenser products, give this one a shot. (The definitive version is the Xbox 360 version)  My favorite game of all time. My comfy game.

382	1	a	Lucius is a unique game. It is a brilliant puzzle game, figuring out how to use your powers and things around you to kill various people, even having a story that even though not fully compelling is made bareable by the great gameplay. The mansion is a joy to explore and its had top standard gore. If you like challenging puzzle games with a dash of blood, this is the one for you.

1683	0	a	Enemies disappear sometimes simply be spinning around. Almost always if trying to get a different vantage point APC, troops will disappear. This makes it hard to predict anything and annoying.  Kind of has a feel between Far Cry and Assasins Creed but needs work.
2670	1	a	Getting pass a few bugs here and there with the game sometimes crashing after a 'cutscene', the game runs fine.  Graphics aren't the greatest but the story line is where this game really shines. Did not expect the game to last over 10 hours as I did do a few sidequests. The gameplay is pretty generic with a bit of quick time action buttons and inventory management of sorts resident evil style. For achievement hunters, most of the achievements will be from doing the side quests or looking for items scattered around the map so expect to spend over 30 or more hours if you plan on getting 100% in the game. There will be a lot of driving around and there is no GPS guidance other than a huge arrow pointing main quest location, so you will need to use the map occassionally to find yourself around to the next point.  Got the game for free during a bundle promotion, but I would say the game is worth it at a discounted price of atleast 50%. Rating the game 7.1/10 mainly due to the story line being so good, but driving to each point is a hassel.

1734	0	a	NOT A PERFORMANCE REVIEW!  The game itself does have some great fighting in it, as a first person shooter it holds its own, however, the controls on computer are not very well thought out, the tutorials that explain the game get thrown at you so fast on screen that you literally have no idea whats going on and the idea behing the whole 'Gorilla warefare' way to play is simply very vague and doesnt really appear apparent in the game.  All in all I refuneded this game because I don't believe the single player campaign warrants a $83 AUD (conversion at time of perchase) pricetag.
332	1	a	Lucius is a game that you want to play only one time. It's a simple and lineal game in which you play a rol as a rich child with supernatural skills solving simple puzzles and killing people without leaving a single footprint. It also have 'Stealth missions' that you will hate because it's SO BUGGED that sometimes, some people can see you backwards or through walls. A couple of mission's hints are not quite clear enough to the player, so maybe sometimes you'll need to roam around the mansion trying to see what you need to do.  Pros:  + Great Idea of the game + Barely funny + Free movement + Open world (Mansion in this case) + Nice skills  Cons:  - A lot a bugs (Example: the stairs and the tricycle are not very compatible) - Bad face factions - Sequence repetitions (Those guys in the garage with the same music and the same conversation everytime) - Exaggerated ragdoll functions (See what happens when you shoot someone with the gun) - 6 Hour duration average - 2 unneccessary achievements: play 20 hours and 40 hours - You cannot do anything but the quests - When you finish the game, the only thing you can do is just start it over again - WTF final  My score is 6/10

1356	1	a	seems like a pretty cool driving/zed killing game.
450	0	a	First of all I can't really understand why this game has mostly positive reviews. Death ideas are clichÃ©d. The plot is non-existent. Shooting someone with a pistol, or using a fireball results in a hit-and-run like effect on the victim. Hitman 2 required a full clip to be emptied on a victim to get this effect. Lucius' cannon would flabbergast even Dirty Harry. The fire extinguisher scene from the end of the game should occur in the game studio during the production phase. The 20h and 40h achievements are an offence in their own right. Especially that the playthrough takes 10 hours if you take a nap in the meantime. It's good that you can sleep through their completion.    - 'Unique 3D horror adventure gaming experience' - depends on one's definition of 'unique';  - '3D Open World' - to some extent;  - 'Cinematic Cut-scenes' - but surely not climatic;  - 'Breathtaking Atmosphere and Stunning Visuals' - breathtaking like a cockroach on a kitchen table;  - 'Harness Supernatural Powers, including Telekinesis and Mind Control' - if you can harness the game physics to move items;  - 'Experience the terror of a classic tale from the horror movie genre' - terror indeed.  Shiver Games breaks the fourth wall by making the player scared with how the game is made, not by the game itself. Cheers on that!

From day 1, I could not get started due to the extremely slow and choppy framerate. No matter what I did, I could not get it to run correctly. All I can say is be warned....... This game is a real Piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ !!!!!
1985	1	a	I am having a lot of fun with this game - I don't think there's any point considering it alongside DOOM, as they're both entirely different propositions.   The open-world is great, full of loot and the gameplay features plenty of weapon and gear upgrades to chase. The weapons themselves have been fun, and the on-the-fly modding is fun. It's possible to recruit several AI followers to help you with quests, and you have to think a little bit before attempting to tackle them - it's not always possible to run in guns blazing. There's verticality in the environment that you have to use, and more than one kind of stealth that is necessary.  My main complaints would be that the enemies are capable of killing you within a few shots, which has led to a few frustrating moments where I've been sent back to square one. It's not always clear which way is the best to tackle missions and quests, but having said that, I'm still playing.   I think this is a way better game than what the reviews have been saying. I haven't had any performance problems, though, which would probably change my opinion of the game if I did have them.

1446	1	a	My experience with the first Homefront game was not especially pleasant. Although the setting was well done and interesting (even allowing for the ludicrous plot) the game itself felt like every linear FPS single-player campaign criticism rolled into one. So when Homefront: Revolution was announced, I scoffed and then ignored it until recently when a free weekend had some friends reporting good things and I tried it. Glad I did.  I think most people compare HF:R to an urban Far Cry 3/4 but that's because it's largely true. Enter a region, note your plot objective, then ignore it as you fight your way through buildings, conquering then and flipping the map from red to blue. Actions can increase your standing with the city residents until they are finally inspired to rise up and riot, attacking their Korean occupiers. It's repetitive and, like Far Cry (or games like Mad Max or Shadow of Mordor), by the second strike point you'll probably know if you feel like playing 30 more hours because the game won't change significantly. The story is serviceable even if nothing amazing or thought-provoking. It's an excuse to run around a ruined city and shoot dudes and take over territory. The simple bottom line is that if you enjoy games in the Ubisoft 'point control' model, you'll likely enjoy Homefront: Revolution.  Guns were interesting though the system took me a little while to appreciate. You have your Primary/Secondary weapon but each of them can convert into two additional weapons. So your semi-auto pistol can convert into a small SMG and/or a silenced pneumatic pistol depending on your needs. Add in attachments (scopes, silencers, etc) and you get an impressive amount of flexibility and essentially seven weapons at a time (3x Primary, 3x Secondary plus an RPG) though you'll need to plan tactically and find cover to convert your assault rifle into a light machine gun on the fly. Still, it nicely bridges the gap between console-based limited gun slots and becoming a walking arsenal.  Finally, the game includes a co-op system where you and up to three friends can band together for missions and gain experience and money for skill/weapon/gear unlocks. Although there's an air of randomness about it (you buy a crate and hope for a good weapon), it's all self-contained and there's no item store or cash shops. The system is in addition to the single player game rather than the focus and it adds some additional play once you're done.  To be fair, trying Homefront: Revolution well after its initial release meant that I avoided its rocky, buggy launch and got in after the worst of it was ironed out. When I played, it was relatively bug free. No game-breaking issues for me, although once I dropped through the map and once had a physics glitch fatally launch me into the air. Out of 50 hours of play, I can't complain though. It played well on my aging system (i7-860 @ 3.6GHz, R9 290X, 12GB) with a consistent 60fps at 1080p on High settings.
390	1	a	I literally just bought the game yesterday and I love it, only wish I have gotten it sooner, but I saw there's a sale and I got it. The puzzles, the story, the graphics, it's like none of the kind you see out there. Please note that this is a very hard and challenging game, but It'll never bore you as you'll continue to explore and test the many missions and mamny charachters.  8.5/10 Would definitely recommend.
1729	0	a	Controls are sloppy, Enemy AI is rough at best. A lot of potential squandered by poor execution. Sounds familiar to the franchise.
989	1	a	WAS OKAY not really a fun end 
1667	1	a	I really don't see why this game received all the hate it did. Yes, it's not ground-breaking and was maybe a bit over-hyped before release, but overall, it's a solid, quality, polished, semi-open-world FPS, with passable story, great GFX, good sound and customisable guns.  Recommended.
2742	1	a	Worst game i've played in my life. Best game of all time.  0/10 10/10  You will suffer it like a torture. You will enjoy it like an org*sm.  You will NEVER forget it.  Don't ask. Just play it.
3056	1	a	For many years Nifflas has been developing games on the PC. The two most notable of these titles are Within a Deep Forest and Knytt. Within a Deep Forest had players taking control of a sentient bouncing ball that had to save the world from a bomb. The game focused on the bouncing physics of different types of balls of different weights and materials.  Knytt focused on a little hero of the same name needing to find parts to fix a crashed spaceship so that he could get back home. The mechanics here dealt with the notion of climbing and sticking to walls. Both of these games have now been combined to create Knytt Underground which marks Nifflasâ first move into the realm of console gaming.  Split into three chapters, Knytt Underground has players take on the role of the mute Mi Sprocket as she explores a huge environment. Her aim is to look for human artefacts and complete quests in a Metroidvania style. The first two chapters act as short tutorials to help players understand the mechanics of how Mi and then Bob the ball handle. By chapter three the two characters have magically been morphed together allowing players to change from Mi to Bob at will.  This allows for some situations requiring lightning reflexes as you change from Mi to the bouncing ball mid-air to cannon off the landscape at all sorts of weird and wonderful angles in order to reach new areas. As well as the bouncing and climbing there are different coloured plumes of smoke which give temporary abilities. These range from turning Mi invisible, making her jump higher or turning her into a set that can shoot horizontally or vertically.  Everything is designed as a means for you to get to another locations and this is where Knytt Underground really works well. Nifflas games before this have always focused on short bursts of quick reflexes and skill. When Knytt Underground asks players to do the same it comes to life in a flurry of ever changing physics and colourful plumes of smoke. (Note to developer â a colour-blind filter would really help with those plumes of smoke)  However, in Knytt Underground there are often long stretches of exploration through empty screens to reach these areas. Sometimes the beautiful graphics and sound create a haunting and ambient environment which you donât mind trekking through. At other times it can all be a little dull as you wander through empty screen after empty screen. This was an issue on the PS3 version but strangely, seems to be much less of an issue on the PC. Maybe weâve mellowed a bit, or maybe it just fits the system a bit better.  When Knytt Underground works it works well but when it doesnât it can feel a bit empty. This isnât helped by the seeming lack of progress you make. There are numerous quests and items to discover but on completing or collecting them it doesnât seem to mean much. Of course it all adds up in the end but the game could do with tweaking its risk reward system to help players feel a greater sense of achievement after they have overcome some of the incredibly fiendish screens.  It is worth highlighting just how lovely the game looks and sounds. This game is beautiful and the music is of the highest standard. We expect no less from a Nifflas game and in that department Knytt Underground can never be faulted with a stunningly ambient atmosphere created throughout. The spaced out save points also seem less of an issue in the PC version, even though some of them are still some distance away from tricky sections of the game and back tracking is something that can begin to hinder the experience. We lost count of the amount of times we trekked along a tunnel for five or six screens only to reach a character telling us we needed to bring a certain item to them. This then meant trekking back through all the screens again. There really isnât a need for this and you wonder if the game would have benefitted from a slightly smaller, more focused, map without many of the empty screens - or at least the ability to teleport between save points.  Overall, Knytt Underground is another promising game for Nifflas. The look and sound of the game is gorgeous and easily rivals the best 2D artwork out there. The game itself gives players a huge world to explore but many may well feel that it lacks focus and a real sense of rewards for the skill you need in order to progress. Those looking for an adventure set at a slower pace will love it, while others will be left wanting a bit more excitement.  7/10
1459	0	a	Kind of average. The game, mechanics are relatively dull and boring, AI is horrible. I find this disappointing, as I actually enjoyed the original Homefront, and was looking forward to this. 4/10

2205	1	a	ill say it right now: they had a line to reach, and they missed it. not by much though.  pros: guns sound and handle well (by sound i mean reasonably realistic) graphically pleasing- there is a con ill talk about later fairly large map funny AI- another con ill talk about the co op mode is fun af, specially when you realise that you can kill yourself and your mates with one well timed bike dismount you can make a co op squad of old people (female and male) and kick â¥â¥â¥. Norks minimal gameplay bugs- bar the AI ones. yet to see any micros- remember reading about them being in game but seem to have disappeared.  cons: optimisation is needed hardcore. AI, both friendly and enemy, can go full potato- stuck on random objects, block doors, teleport, randomly spawn/despawn infront of you etc hoping for more co op content. even main story co op (maybe) very minimal realism in death (guess they didnt want to up the rating)  would i recommend this game? not at full price. worthy of a steam sale purchase.  season pass is up to you, id recommend just getting the bundle- ON SALE.

105	1	a	An amazing game that suffered a poor launch, and could have been as big as League of Legends if it wasn't for stardock messing up their end of the job with the netcode. Demigod was a true victim of Piracy, at launch it had around 18,000 units sold while there were over 100,000 players on the servers.   Extremely solid ARTS, all of the characters work well together and are interesting enough. Voice acting is ok. The music is cliche but definitely good enough to get you into those intense moments. Graphics mostly hold up to today's standards even though the game is from 2009.

1538	0	a	  Disclaimer: I tried this as part of the Steam Free Weekend. I own and have finished the original Homefront (under Wine), which I actually didn't mind (despite its flaws).  I really wanted to like Homefront: The Revolution too. And I do... to a point. Unfortunately, there's also a lot not to like. It's a shame too, since it feels like given a few more months of work, The Revolution could have been a real winner.   What I liked:  - The idea for the story is something I can get behind. However it wasn't well explained, and there were gaps missing which were left to the imagination.  - It's an open world FPS, like modern Far Cry games, Dying Light, Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, etc. I don't mind that they took the series in a new direction, although I was surprised.  - The artwork, voice acting, etc. were (for the most part) top notch.  - No in-game nagging for DLC content. There was actually no mention of DLC at all in-game. Good.  - Hidden Time Splitters 2 game, available from Extras under the main menu once unlocked.   What I disliked:  - Bugs. Bugs everywhere! Let's see...  I fell through the floor a few times. I once got stuck in the level causing me to need to restart from a checkpoint. Enemies sometimes fell through the floor after they died. There is a part where you need to stand in line, but the people in front of you get stuck and you can't pass - you have to reload a save (twice, in my case) to continue, with no ability to skip a lengthy cut scene. There was plenty of AI pathing issues. Enemies in the distance would spawn and de-spawning whenever they felt like it (even when looking right at them) making sniping from any significant distance useless. Some jobs could not be achieved if they were not attempted early in the game. Some achievements only activated upon closing the game, leading me to retry things I unknowingly already achieved.  At one point the game loaded a checkpoint without me telling it to (and without me dying). The game also crashed to the desktop multiple times. One time the game would not show anything on screen at launch (but the process was running in the background and had to be killed off through Task Manager). Explosives could be selected when you had none, which caused strange hand animations suggesting the player was carrying something invisible.  One issue I found one time was that I was unable to get back on a motorcycle because I accidentally drove it a few centimetres outside of the mission area, even though I was standing right next to it and there was no other motorcycle nearby. At another point I had to load a previous checkpoint because an audio loop (beeping indicating the close proximity to a Resistance stash) wouldn't stop playing once the stash was found and I had walked away.  Consider the game beta quality at best. It's really no wonder the game received such bad reviews in the face of so many problems. I didn't even try multiplayer!  - Still no sign of the promised GNU/Linux support. If the game had this at launch, I would have purchased it despite the bugs.  - Inability to fast travel to any point to the map which has been captured. Travelling to try to finish off uncompleted jobs is frustrating. Selecting a destination on the map is not remembered when you die and re-spawn. Further, the map is not accessible on the motorcycle.  - The store menu is a pain. If you want to purchase 10 consumable items (such as explosives), you need to select the explosive, confirm the purchase, and repeat this 10 times. I didn't even notice how to get to the job menu until late in the game due to the bad layout. If you don't specifically look for the active jobs menu, you won't notice it. You can also die looking at the menu, even though the game audio has stopped and you are in a single-player campaign.  - Gun-play needs work. It's more frustrating than it should be. If you're using the shotgun, there's one guy left nearby and you need to reload, the game won't let you insert just one or two shells and fire away - you need to fill it up completely with shells before the reload animation will stop and you can fire. This caused me to die on many occasions.  If an airship spots you, enemies will spawn from all around you almost instantly - even from areas you know you just cleared out. This forces you to play in a trigger-happy style, but the gun-play is not well geared for it.  Grenade and cover systems are horrible for keyboard+mouse. There is also no âHold to duckâ key binding option, so duck can only be toggled.  - Dying is frustrating. You won't generally lose much progress, but repawning takes too long. When you die, the game is unresponsive for a few seconds, eventually some text slowly fades in telling you to press enter. If you press enter too early (ie. before the text has fully faded in) the key press won't register. And you can't press or click any other button to continue - only enter will work. This causes me to constantly bash the key in frustration! Next, the game will start loading the level again. On my overclocked i7-6700k, that takes another 10 or so seconds I guess.  For me, this is perhaps the single most frustrating part of the entire game. If you die in a single player campaign, you should always be able to get back in the action immediately.  - No Crossfire support. It's 2016, and this isn't a Bethesda title (which typically run amazingly well even on a single GPU anyway). If you want to call yourself a AAA developer, Crossfire is the expectation. I played the game at 2560x1440 on a Fury X with basically everything maxed out, and I was getting anything from just under 40 FPS to just under 60 FPS. That's significantly worse than running Far Cry Primal on a single Fury X. Of course, Far Cry Primal can use Crossfire anyway.  - Lack of originality. The story was fine (although the last few minutes were somewhat painful), but the general game mechanics (capturing structures, unlocking parts of the map, finding hidden loot, etc. all feels a bit too familiar. This isn't in itself a problem provided there is also something new brought to the table, or the overall approach is polished and improved in some way. Unfortunately that just hasn't happened here, and actually a lot of the similarities to comparable titles seem like a step backwards. Obviously Ubisoft is a massive company with a lot of experience in making these types of games, so I'm not at all surprised that Homefront hasn't turned out better than a Far Cry experience. However Homefront developers should have anticipated this and provided something new to compensate.  - The original Homefront advertised the game with a metal compilation CD including tracks such as a Metalica cover by Periphery. Sadly, that never received much promotion, is no longer available and doesn't even appear to have been attempted for The Revolution.  - The textures all seem to be high resolution and generally look great, but occasionally I came across something strange. eg. a truck that was completely green, including the tires. The shading was drawn correctly, but possibly the textures were missing. It's unclear if that was another bug or the artwork was unfinished.  - Parkour really isn't a strong point here. The Revolution has it, but feels very limited compared to what the Far Cry and Dying Light universes offer. Climbing a building is generally a matter of walking around the outside of it (and nearby buildings) looking for a wooden ramp, as opposed to trying to perform risky manoeuvres from a great height. It all feels very dumbed down. The game also imposes significant impact damage if you fall.  - No benchmark mode.  In summary, the game feels like a poor-man's Far Cry. It's frustrating, both because the game causes you frustration, and also because the game feels like it was very close to becoming something much greater than it turned out to be.
1746	1	a	I've seen a lot of mixed reviews, but I'm really enjoying this game. The gameplay is a mashup of Call of Duty type combat mixed with the open-world territory capture of games like Far Cry. You have to capture points on a map until you control an entire area, and you choose whether to play stealth infiltration or go in guns blazing. If you can find this game on sale, it's a no-brainer to pick it up.

1476	1	a	Honestly not even a fraction of as bad as people say it is.  Guns feel nice. Neither you nor the enemies are bullet sponges. Story is interesting enough to keep you going. Don't expect a full open world RPG though. The open map serves only to give you a sense of freedom of engagement and movement, but it should be played running from mission to mission, the open world is not enough to keep you entertained for long, at all. This game can be compared to Far Cry 3/4 in terms of gameplay, but I think this game fixes a lot of things Far Cry 3/4 did wrong, such as the aforementioned bullet sponge enemies and the general feel of the weapons. You don't have a huge arsenal to choose between, but just enough to fit every possible playstyle, and the game features a rather simplistic weapon modding mechanic which allows you to toggle between certain weapon types, the pistol can quickly be converted into an SMG for example, and the rifle can be modded into a sniper in a matter of seconds, depending on if you've bought the mod.  All in all, a strong 7/10 in my opinion.

1046	0	a	Normally in games playing as the bad guys and killing people is fun. In this Devil's child simulator the act of murder is not satisfying or entertaining, it's an unpleasant chore, because people that you must eliminate to progress through the game, are actually nice men and women and killing them feels like a terrible thing to do. The deaths in this game are way too realistic and unnecessary brutal, the protagonist's character in nonexistent, and the plot is paper-thin. Forgettable and unimpressive.

1686	1	a	A fun, average shooter game. Would recommend when it dips to $30 or below
2300	1	a	The world is very immersive. That is all really...   The only thing in my opinion holding this game back is depth. Its like everything they did was only 50%... they decided to go with quantity over quality.  Although this game has its flaws(which is many) I couldnt keep myself away from it. The world was believable all the way until the final sequence. The story is cool, but I think the way they decided to engage it was a mistep. This game would've been better without the 'open world' mechanics. they could have invested more in a deeper rich story through linear well thought out levels.  At one point the game gives you a decision to kill someone or let them live. This game could've done so much more with real decision making mechanics to effect the outcome.   Things get repetative. You do the same thing in every district to further branch the story which was just annoying. On top of that it feels like you... just you... are the revolution. Most of the time you'll be doing things alone, even when there is all out anarchy and everyone is running around shooting the KPA you'll be lonewolfing through the mission. You can recruit 2 resistance members but they are kind of useless and sometimes end up walking into your bullets.  The thing they got right with this game though is the mood. Everything is a wreck, it really feels and looks like America went to â¥â¥â¥â¥ when you walk throughout these areas. The devs really outdid themselves with the level design. The level at the pier with the two aircraft carriers just rusting away was one of the coolest things ive seen in a video game.

422	0	a	I suspect that the early plans for Lucius involved dropping the son of Lucifer into a small open world filled with people who need killing and offering multiple ways to perform said kills. After the first couple of more scripted kills would offer a tutorial on how the game's mechanics functioned, Lucius would then be unleashed to study, stalk and ultimately execute each member of the household in whichever order the player wished. Sadly, this isn't the game we get. Instead, the game feels like it was massively scaled back and forced into a different, more linear mold about halfway through production. Instead of building traps, staging 'accidents' or setting people against each other, the player is instead forced to trigger scripted deaths using inventory items and a suite of flimsy magic powers that felt very tacked-on. You kill your targets in the order that is scripted for you and the game will sometimes set everything up so that basically all you need to do is pull the trigger. Yawn. I give Lucius an A- for concept but unfortunately, the execution of concept is equally (or more so) important and that's where Lucius fails. There's still some entertainment to be had during its 5-6 hour campaign and it floods you with achievements for almost no effort, but in the end it falls a little too short for a recommendation.

The story is the weakest part but it can easily be over looked cause the game is fun. Think a far cry set in a run down city instead of a jungle.

2105	1	a	Grabbed this+DLC on sale for 35 bucks, it's worth 35 bucks.  Also grabbed it because I wanted this kind of game from ARMA III, but haven't got it yet...   It's not really 'free roam'; you do roam freely, but the world is made up of comparment levels, interconnected by tubes, so still that old school Deus Ex, Postal 2 type free roam; not GTA or ARMA free roam...   THAT SAID; this is a fairly solid game so far in my experience, I turned most all details down to low and can run it fine on my 1 gig 550ti, 8 gig RAM five year old system with no sweat.  Story line and cinematics are pretty standard dramatic BS fair, rebels dress like rock stars; and don't seem fond of helmets... I donno... Anyway... Game play is good; shooting is good; explosions are good; lots of loot; could use more gibs; I haven't seen any gibs yet; why do all these new games fear gibs?
770	1	a	Bought this one on a whim, tempted by its description. No regrets, lads. Lucius has this nice feeling to it. Something like first Mafia and Max Payne 2. There's no shooting and you play as a six year old spawn of Lucifer born on 6 6 1966(jesus...) but resemblance in serving the plot and world is collosal. Gameplay straight out of Hitman series with some supernatural powers.  Had a lot of pleasure playin this, it was a one day blast without a rest. Not every day you are the bad guy without morals, or are you?
2998	1	a	Just love it. Sure itÂ´s 'terrible' as a game, but I canÂ´t but say that itÂ´s pure gold for anyone who loves Twin Peaks or something deeper than gameplay and visuals.
2488	1	a	Had to wait a while for the English translation and some patches to polish the game play but once i took the plunge and started playing i just can't stop playing it - Just have to see where this games richly detailed world takes me. Game play wise it is strictly hard core, old school and tougher than an trolls bum! Not one for the impatient or for those who skip dialogue though: the game contains a novels worth of text.

2889	1	a	This game is a cult classic. Not sure how I never got into this game when it originally came out.
2957	1	a	What a weird game.. Terrible PC port; keeps crashing, freezing, lagging with a GTX 1060. Also the gameplay, please, this is so BAD.. Probably the worst driving experience since a while. But.. BUT. This game is AMAZING, there is something so unique to it. A GTAxSilent HillxTwin Peaks cross over. How could it not be great ? Despite all its weaknesses, I spent an amazing moment with the inspector Morgan and I would definetely recommend it to anyone. You need to play it and to go through the first terrible crashes and weird 2-3 hours of gameplay adaptation.  Really really great story taking a twist on what seems a Twin Peaks copycat, but it's absolutely not. There is also a very interesting ending, and a truly beautiful analysis not so hard to understand on the player's take.
430	1	a	Lucius is quite a unique game which really caught my interest. It's not particularly a horror game, but it can be a little bit creepy at times and a lot of the deaths are pretty brutal. The game is mainly puzzle based and I think that the puzzles are quite easy, the only difficult part about it is probably locating the items. Everything graphically is good and it presents the game well in an appropriate style. I liked the achievements in this game, it really felt like I was progressing and it was quite motivating, I also liked the fun extra achievements too. However there were some problems with the game; there was a lot of laughable glitches concerning the character models, slow loading, a few crashes here and there, some freezing for a few seconds and bad lip syncing. I don't know if these (excluding glitches) were only exclusive to me though. Overall it's a nice, short game with a consistent theme, nice puzzles, nice graphics, a great soundtrack, well executed atmosphere. I recommend Lucius, especially if you like puzzles, looking for stuff, satanic stuff, murder and achievements. :)

2021	1	a	HTR is an awesome game, the story was exellent however I would have liked a character customization to make me feel like I was part of the game, seeing how we didn't get to see Ethan Brady's face through the entire game. The weapon customization is sweet but some of the attachments would have been used for more of weapons. The sound of the game was not okay, it seemed that the sound was taken from videos of weapons. The weapons didn't sound right, the gameplay sound was awful and backround sound was plain assault to the ears. The cut-sense was average, not 2016 graphics but more like 2013 graphics.  Resistance Mode is a dissapontment, you can customize a character but you are given little to work with and items are unlocked through game play. You play on maps with other players trying to complete the task. If one of your team is down, you can revive them but if every player is down then its game over and you have to restart the mission. Players can even drop-in or drop-out of the game.   The game is good to where you will keep playing it to the very end so i'd give this game a 6/10 score and would recommend gamers picking this game up.

489	0	a	This game is terrible. The idea is quite interesting, but the game is so poor in writing and programming that it is ruined from the start. The kills are probably ok for the most part (although there are some VERY silly ones), but sometimes you have to get items you wouldn't have even remotely considered getting for this kill, it gets ridiculous. The animations are just god awful, they are pretty basic and ruin most of the kills. Finally, the game is poorly optimized so even with a good rig you will get some fps drops, not to mention that on some parts I got stuck (usually in the garden ladders).

It has some sort of potential for fun game but I dunno not for me it's sketched to much, with plenty bugs which are making comedy of this. For few bucks you can try it.

1477	0	a	Story: Predictable, I'm ok with that Gameplay: Fair, slightly interested, I like it Graphics: Amazing assuming your comp handles it correctly(Many people have bugs, I do not) Bugs: MASSIVE AMOUNTS! AI Bugs, Wall Bugs, Graphic Bugs, and GAMEBREAKING BUGS!  I was ok to keep the game and play it through even with the bugs until I ran into GAMEBREAKING BUGS over and over again. 4 times I ran into these bugs. I reported them, I also reported how to recreate them. As of 5/22/16 they are not fixed. I am not a play tester for this game, but I assure you it needed some. These bugs were easily found and recreated.  Now how are these bugs Gamebreaking? Basically, it puts you in a mission that can neither be completed or end. Often area becomes a ghost town because AI won't spawn properly, or they get stuck in walls. Your objective will be to do X, but you have already completed X so you can't do it. Quest/Mission Flag fails to realize you have already done request. You are just stuck in same area, with no way to proceed in the game. Does not reward exploring because you might bug your game if you explore something too early.  Thats ok, I can just go to a previous save right. NO... by the time you figure out you have put yourself in a never ending bug. Its too late. There are no save states. Game autosaves and autosaves often. You have a total of 4 autosaves. These autosaves happen whenever you do something significant or if you change your weapon at a locker. Basically, you can't rely on savestates to return to if you bug the game.  Their solution if you get bugged and cannot proceed.  1. Wait for patch to fix bug.  2. Erase your saves, and start over.   I started over 4 times, and found different Gamebreaking bugs each time. The only way to avoid these bugs is to not explore and only follow mission requests. Makes game boring and not fun at all.

2074	1	a	LATEST AND FINAL UPDATE: I finished the game, 30 hours all told, and I really enjoyed it. I had one lockup after 27 hours, but that was it, otherwise it was great and mostly glitch free, one small bug that prevented a minor side mission from being completed, but nothing that effected the campaign. So, as before, I give the game a definite thumbs-up.   UPDATE: I now have over fifteen hours in and I'm still enjoying the game. The game world gets even more interesting when you reach the Ashgate Yellow Zone (which is the third Yellow Zone, if you include the first one you see at the start of the game). There is color and a whole different looking environment than the first couple of Yellow Zones.  And in those fifteen hours no crashes, no glitches and most smooth 60fps gameplay. It has slowed down at times, but the only way I knew was via the Steam fps counter, otherwise I never would have even known it's was doing 60fps. And damn, it's a really pretty, very detailed game.  ORIGINAL REVEW: I have in just under eleven hours on the Steam version and Iâm really enjoying it. It does have some rough spots, but itâs a lot of fun to play. I like open world games and Homefront scratches that itch. I think combat is a lot of fun and the modular weapon system works great and is a nice change. The plot is rather thin, but really so was the plot in Watch_Dogs and it didnât bother me. The game map is fantastic. I donât have any issues with the âgreynessâ of the Red Zones, there is a lot of color and objects around all that concrete. And there are tunnels and high catwalks and all sorts of paths to use.  I do have issues trying to access some of the harder to reach locations, the game doesnât make them easy. However the designers included a clever system of using blue paint or flags to let the player know that there really is something to find and gives hints on how to reach them.  Some people have faulted the AI, but Iâm finding them a challenge. They do seek cover when fired on, call in reinforcements and will flank you. And in the Yellow Zones, your stealth techniques really do get a workout.  Itâs not a perfect game, but it is fun. And if it doesnât break new ground in some areas, itâs better that the recent Assassinâs Creed games and as interesting (in a different way) as Far Cry 3 or 4. Fair warning however; it does take a good half-dozen hours before you really experience the complete gameplay.

906	0	a	I've played this game for only a short time, but I've found the experience to be long and drawn out. The system doesn't give you any way of assistance of navigating this confusing place, that is the Dante Manor. If you had a more defined area to explore and search in, the pace would have been much faster and would have made for a much more novel game. But as it stands, the game is fraught with small irrtations without relief. The only source to find a way forward with the quests is to access walk throughs online.

The narrative is good but its not great because you can't turn of subtitles and the voice actors are not that great. The murders are good but sometimes they don't always make sense. Sometimes their straightforward and you have no problems. Other times you can't figure them out and your forced to use a walkthrough. A shame the sequel to this game didn't turn out. This game could really use a re do to make better graphics and more lines of dialogue with better voice actors. Still, its good for 5 hours of fun.

1257	1	a	The title of this game basically tells you all you need to know about the gameplay: run over zombies with your selected vehicle. You run over zombies or kill them with weapons attached to the vehicle while completing primary and secondary objectives in the story mode.  The story mode has a basic plot that is very typical for zombie based games, not ground breaking. It looks like another apocalypse. Your mission begins with a briefing from General Blofeld that you must clear out an area filled with zombies or rescue certain people who are being overwhelmed by zombies. As you go about your mission, you run over zombies while your vehicle gets covered in blood and earn combo bonuses. These combo bonuses continue to multiply if you continue to mow down zombies in a bloody mess, something like chaining your matches in Audiosurf. The top-down perspective looks like the first 2 Grand Theft Auto games and the action looks like the Carmageddon series since you are constantly causing a bloody good time around town.  The weapons are scattered around town and all are pretty useful. They include flamethrowers, machine guns, railguns, rocket launchers, and nitro. All weapons can be upgraded using the cash you earn from each mission completed. The nitro really speeds up your car and helps you reach your destination faster, but it is also useful in getting out of a tight situation when being overwhelmed by large numbers of pedestrians that could potentially make your car explode.  Vehicles are varied and range from taxis to buses. Some vehicles are more useful than others in some missions. The military may ask you to rescue 8 people in a given mission, so the best vehicle could be the bus because it has a carrying capacity of 48 people. All vehicles can be upgraded for more speed and better ramming ability. Even with the variety of weapons at your disposal, ramming zombies with power slides and using nitro to go full speed ahead is still more common than shooting.  The zombies range from regular zombies to exploding zombies. The regular zombies are small or medium in size and there are many zombie dogs run over. The real challenge comes in the form of exploding zombies. Exploding zombies are the fat zombies who can detonate themselves when they get near your vehicle. You can be earning great combos while killing 300+ zombies, only to be ruined by a group of 3-4 exploding zombies who commit suicide next to your vehicle, causing it to explode.  There are a few bosses to battle in the game. These bosses can only be defeated with enough firepower using the various weapons in town. It is also necessary to use defense by running away from them when they are ready to attack. A lack of defensive moves will lead to certain death. In addition, the zombies will never leave you alone during boss battles. So, while you are running away to restock ammo the zombies are chasing you. When you are firing away at the bosses the zombies are still attacking you.  There are other modes in the game that add to the zombie splattering fun. There is the blood race mode and the slaughter mode. The blood race mode is about tournaments that require you to compete in different events such as races, eliminator, and endurance and have bronze, silver, and gold medals available. Races require you to finish 1st for gold and you can destroy vehicles by ramming them or with your weapons. Eliminator events require you to cause as many wrecks as possible while going through checkpoints to increase the time remaining. Endurance events require you to drive around with a bomb stuck to your vehicle going through checkpoints to increase the time remaining. The trick in Endurance events is to kill zombies and destroy as many objects as possible to contribute to the time remaining. The slaughter mode is a good old fashioned zombie killing, splattering entertainment. It is all about killing as many zombies as possible from one wave to the next until your vehicle explodes.  The graphics are decent and, while not dazzling, they provide a well-detailed environment. The death animations look cool and make you feel like it is so much fun making your vehicle all red in blood and guts. You can hear the zombies writhe in pain very loudly when you splatter them all over your vehicle or when you blow them away with your weapons.  The vehicles handle well, as the physics feel realistic during the times you have to turn and perform power slides. They also feel realistic according to the type of vehicle. The muscle car feels very fast whereas the bus feels slow, but very powerful for ramming zombies. The super car feels like it is both fast and powerful since it combines all the great attributes of speed and power.  Some may be disappointed by the fact the Zombie Driver HD has no multiplayer. True, there is more replay value after playing the story mode because of the blood race and slaughter modes. However, those who love multiplayer action will not have any opportunity to compete in multiplayer mode.  I think Zombie Driver HD is a lot of fun to play. The story mode feels a little bit short in length, but it is still entertaining enough. The blood race and slaughter modes provide more entertainment and replay value for a low price of $9.99. All the zombie crushing and splattering fun makes this game worth your purchase.  My Score: 7.5/10

283	0	a	Such an interesting concept, but such a poorly done product.  Pro: 1, interesting and immersive setting 2, quite a novel experience 3, nice Artwork (Skins, Landscape change with season, ...) 4, NPC development - distress grows as the game proceeds 5, sidequests (chores)  Contra: 1, the main character should depict a reckless, evil child - but no mimicry at all seems like a puppet -&gt; immersion lost 2, only one (two max) sentences per person per chapter, quite repetitive 3, clipping errors, items vanishing after telekinesis 4, some random audio artefacts (could be hw related) 5, powers should increase each chapter, but you only use them in the most basic form - no real progression 6, single solution problems - no replay value or deviation from plot 7, strange quest updates. like getting the pistol early requires you to retrace the steps to open the safe again (which is empty of course) 8, no saving between chapters   A bit more freedom, less plotholes and the sequel could be great.

1811	0	a	I was really excited when Homefront:the revolution was announced as an open world game. I didn't play the first game in the series more than a few hours for a plethora of reasons. I even waited when reviews were somewhat spotty at best on this game. This new itteration of the Homefront series has some good quirks and some bad. Let's start with the pros shall we? On the list of pros Homefront presents a somewhat large open world for you to bring freedom to. It seems to breathe, it seems to move and be legitimately animated. When I first started playing I was absorbed into the world and excited to explore it. The next pro would definitely be the weapons. Although there isn't a large variety to be had with this game, what it does let you have are a few archetypes that can be customized to your liking (pistol, shotgun, assault rifle, sniper rifle) and each of these weapons has a feeling that it is scrounged up and hastily put together for a fight with a better equipped enemy. There is also crafting of implements of destruction here as well, mostly just your run of the mill grenades, molotovs, mines... and then you also have a few cool rc bombs and drones at your disposal. I feel like these are the main things the game does really well. On the bad side however I will open up to a list of the cons. The game feels rushed , even with the patches out for it so far (6-7ish months after release). Framerat can stutter at times even on a higher end rig. There is also the problem of render distance for the ai. I've seen many times in game where enemy ai can just suddenly disappear, even while you are looking at them. As you can imagine this hinders players who like to use sniping as their main playstyle. This has even happened up close in many tight quarters firefights. Next up is the gunplay, now to me , the gunplay can seem very blocky and almost robotic feeling. It's nice to have interesting tools of the trade, but if they all feel very robotic or almost clunky to operate that takes away part of the fun of having them. One of the final cons I'm going to touch on is the fact that the ai is very poor. The enemy ai seems to be able to predict where you are at instantaniously and almost without warning at all. They also seem to be able to hit you as soon as you start engaging them, I have very rarely been missed by an ai ever in this game. The health system does little to nothing to help this as when you are playing on the hardest difficulty , if you get hit once you're already dead pretty much. That wouldn't be a big deal if the ai weren't all competition grade shooters. Anyways, if you are looking for a fix on an insurgant like game. I suggest you pick up a game like Red Faction Guerilla instead. I had such high hopes for this game and was disappointed by what I had actually recieved.
961	1	a	I Really Enjoyed This Game, I Completed It With All Achievements (Easy). The Ways You Kill The Manor Residents Was Fun &amp; Hilarious At Times.
760	0	a	This game lacks absolutely on being funny. The big problem here is that you have ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA of what to do and you find yourself wandering like an idiot in the house. Which is, as you may argue, NOT funny. The game lacks totally on giving informations about itself and about how to acomplish on tasks... Decent graphics, meh for the voice acting, definitely boring. Don't buy.

2430	1	a	I'm assuming it must have been some pretty horrid optimization and/or bugs that had folks giving this game such poor reviews when it first released. Bought it during the 2016 Winter sale and have had a bug-free, smooth playing experience.  The game itself is great. It takes the Far Cry approach to the open world but pulls it off much better in my opinion. Has yet to feel repetitive or stale and despite people knocking it, have really been enjoying the story. If you grew up watching movies like the original Red Dawn you will love the overall feel and atmosphere.   Visually it's excellent. The Crytek engine is on full display and everything from the lighting to the characters is well above average. The gameplay is great fun. I have really enjoyed the way they mix stealth and action, leaving the player great freedom in approaching most situations. Watching the Norks abuse and kill your Countrymen adds a nice layer of satisfaction when you sneak up on them and plunge a knife into back or neck.  It was about $12 during the sale, which is a ridiculous amount of fun for the money. I could have spent $30 and been plenty happy, hell, I could have probably spent $60 and not been upset with the purchase.  Have yet to try online co-op, but I bought this game for the story and the single player atmosphere more than anything.   Great sequel to the original Homefront that is better than the previous game in every way on the single player front.  8/10 - would stab a Nork in the face again for telling my countryman to lick their boot

1791	0	a	I enjoy the game. I really do, but it's extremely hard for me to give it a recommnedation, even if its discounted heavily. It's not because of the broken AI (not stupid, they're literally broken), laughable model placement mistakes (floating cars, floating debris, clipping scenery, disappearing objects when you go near, etc), broken mechanics (Drones will hunt you across the map instantly if you ever ride a bike even if nobody sees you, when hiding in bins or protable toilets in yellow zones, enemies can actually still see you and will even try to kill you by shooting and throwing bombs but they can never hurt you and your wanted cooldown will still go down. It's pretty funny actually) or that the gameplay can be repetitive (thought personally, i don't find this to be a problem since I'm actually enjoying it).  The reason why I cannot in good faith give this a recommendation, again even if its heavily discounted, is because the game has the potential to literally ruin your computer physically. After beating halfway through Holloway (in terms of main missions), the game will HARD CRASH randomly during your playthrough from hencepoint onwards (sound will still continue to play as normal). It doesn't matter if you reinstalled the game, if you try to modify game files to make it more stable or have the latest updated version of the game. The game will crash on you so hard that it literally freezes your entire computer and your only option (unless you have a fast CPU and W10, which then you can try to 'log out of user' thereby forcing the pc to do a 'soft reset' by forcibly turning everything running off when it exits your Window user account) is to restart the computer.  Trying to turn just the .exe of the game alone either via task manager or right clicking to close via the task bar hardly helps. Sometimes it does turn homefront off after repeated tries, but overall doing either a full reset or as mentioned with signing out of your Window account is significantly faster and helps.  Literally I am losing files and getting system error messages (twice i even had to do a window restore because the game somehow destroyed/corrupted some important files) because of these sudden serious freeze to the whole PC because of the game. Seeing how this is very likely the final patch version of the game, i suggest you avoid this game unless you are willing to bear with the hard freezes, nevermind the glitchiness of the game itself.  Disappointing really. One of the most broken games I have ever played thus far. And what makes it worse is that I actually personally find the game enjoyable despite it glitches and understandably repetitive gameaplay.  My rig loadout is on my profile if you need reference on my rig capabilities. Also another note is that if you're using RGB products such as keyboards (Corsair K70. Apex M800), mousepads (Razer firefly, Apex MM880) and mice (Rival 700, Razer Mamba new, Sensei Wireless, M65 Pro RGB) the game WILL freeze your lighting (another indication that the game has some serious software issue). Headsets RGB doesn't seem to be affected by it for some reason, same goes for any RGB lighting for your case such as RGB fans and NZXT Hue+.   I'm not sure if the issue is because of Nvidia cards since I'm running 2 1070 (i tried running the game with and without SLI, problem still persists), so i can't say the same for AMD users. Nevertheless take it a cautionary note
289	0	a	TL;DR: If you want a buggy satanic open-world-ish puzzle game,this might be the one for you,if it was cheaper.  This game is short and buggy.It didn't feel like a satanic murderer sandbox,like most reviews and curators have said,but rather a game that would belong to the puzzle genere.I,myself,have experienced quite a few (maybe a lot more than just a few) bugs trough my 2 times finishing the story.The one that bothered me the most was journal entries literally not appearing no matter what I done.My ouja board was the only thing that helped me commit the murders.They would all at once pop up only after I killed the person,and of course I had to use a walkthrough at certain points,even if it is not a thing I normally do.The other annoying bug was Lucius getting stuck in the ground in certain points of Dante Manor,making me restart the chapter.Kristen Stewart has MORE facial expressions than the main character,that doesn't really even look like a 6 year old,and this logic really ruined the immersion for me-basically,in that manor of rich and respectable people he was the only main character that dressed in a suit.A 6 year old.Not his dad,not the detective that tries to catch you,not his mom,only his grandfather if I'm not mistaken.The other bugs I was talking about were visible but not always ruining the gameplay,things like models becoming colourless,glitching out,etc.And the only thing I found is to blame were lazy developers,for even grammar is not correct sometimes,usually in the MAIN CUTSCENES.The Dante Manor,the place where the action of the game happens is also pretty repetitive itself,having two mirrored parts,only with different room layouts,giving the big bad house a repetitive feeling,and even despite it's maze like corridors,trust me,that layout is so simple you'll don't need the map anymore from chapter 6 onwards.The hitbox of your final spell 'Combustion' is very rough and not tweaked for individual models,it can only hit the chest I think,nothing will happen if you set someone's hand or foot on fire (so real).The turn-the-crosses-upside-down system is a bit cheesy,or cliche,whatever you want to call it.And if you may want an explanation to my 40 hours of playing it,I left it open,because there is an achievement where you need to play 40 hours,and as the other are really easy,with 3 quarters of them you have completed before you know it,it would be a shame to now make this one a perfect game...hell,even Dark Souls achievements are less annoying than leaving this damn game open 40 hours.

1592	1	a	Great game. I dont believe it should be getting as much hate as it is. Never once crashed for me, no bugs, runned smooth and the entire idea of the game was just really neat and interesting. I enjoy every bit of it and Had a good time blowing the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of the KPA and starting the crowds of people to get all wild. There is some downsides though, I never felt SUPER attached to the campaign or story for example when a big character would die Id just be like,' welp â¥â¥â¥â¥.' It wasent like gears of war, red faction, arma 3, and bunch of more attached feeling campaignes. Other then that I enjoyed it all and if your looking for a cool story, fun gameplay to burn time, then I recommend buying this. 8/10  10/10 would whatch guys face get bashed with hammer again 10/10 would whatch that guy who bashed the other guys face in get his face bashed in 10/10 would whatch that guy who bashed the guys face in who bashed the other guys face in get shot in the knee.

1014	1	a	Okay I first heard of this game by watching a Youtube streamer play it and I can say I sat and watched him play the entire game and enjoyed the storyline, the game play and even the fact that the main character is not your usual protaganist. I really wanted to play it so I went straight onto an e shop to see how much it was, though unfairly I was unemployed at the time so I could not afford to buy it so imagine my surprise when today on Steam it was reduced and I had money to buy it at last. I played it straight away and although I am rubbish with keyboard controls I found it quickly enjoyable and amusing. The dark story despite having seen it all before was much better than any goody two shoes story of heroism I was used too simply because of the idea of the story despite there not being a great deal of story anyway. I really suggest this game to any gamer type.

2318	1	a	This is exactly what Homefront should've been, however there are some weird stuff with the game  - Playing the game on Recruit difficulty is still a challenge, I don't get it that you die so easily - North Koreans depicited here are weird looking almost cyborgs like - On the PC version the frame rate drops aren't constant, while on the consoles the game runs at 15-30 fps - There just isn't so much stuff to do and the game becomes abit of a chore rather than fun  But still it's worth to checkout if you like alternate history games :)  It's a 6/10 for me, could've been better if they'd let it be in development more time :(

1942	1	a	I don't know what the complaining is all about. I do understand why the negetive reviews when it first came out but I started to play after all of the patches and it runs fine for me. I think that the people who are saying that their games are crashing after the updates aren't being honest with themselves or people about what their computers can handle or if it's even stable. I am running this on a 3-4 year old Alienware 18 laptop at medium settings at I have no issues at all. It's even locked in at 60 FPS and the game still looks amazing. I'm pretty sure that most people are trying to run the game at ultra when we all know that this has the cryengine and it's a very demanding engine.   As for the game review. I've only played 1 hour and 15 minutes so I don't know the storyline that well yet but I'm enjoying the open world aspect of it. I love games like this so it's my cup of tea but not for everybody. I think that people wanted a call of duty type of game when they bought into this game and was let down. I personaly believe that people have too high of expectations these days and do not remember back in the day when you got a glitchy game for $60 and it was like 5 hours long. The AI isn't that great on it but I am going to try a harder level to see what that's like.  One thing that annoys me is that I keep seeing reviews on people that are hating the game and not recommending it have 40+ hours soaked into the game. I don't know about you but I refuse to put that many hours into something I really hate. I also do not take bad reviews for people that have spent .2 hours on it as well. Not even sure if my 1.25 hours count but I just wanted to say that it's stable and like the game.   As for the price? I do think the $25 I spent on it is worth it and I also think that the developers are trying real hard to make the game great. Definately wait for the next sale.   There you go, my two cents worth. You can either hate it or like it but either way I'm going to keep playing this game because I enjoy it and do not care about people that whine about everything.

9	1	a	I love this game. I eternally love, love.. LOVE this game.  I can replay it over and over and over again, as if I'm searching for something new but never find it. Which brings me to why I hate this game. I hate this game so much for making me want more of this game.  Fantastic artwork, a storyline that you can pretty much sense just through some of the battle dialogue, the ability to constantly adjust the camera angles because I forget what game I'm playing and think that I'm strafing- instead, I disorient myself and forget where I am. I know that there are newer, updated games out there, and I know it had a rough start, but it's one of those simple games you can keep going back to with your friends or do some tournaments on your own and pretend that you have friends. (Clearly, I choose to do the latter.)  .. I really need friends. So I can buy them the 4-pack and make them pretend to be my pixelated friends.  (I love this game.)

2198	1	a	I get the hate, but at the same time I really am enjoying this game. Its kind of an open world Half-life. At 3440x1440 resolution Im getting solid 60fps, sometimes more. Granted I copied the SLI bits from RYSE and pasted them over to Homefronts. But that little copy and pasting gave me 90% utilization in both of my 980ti's. Who knows, I may grow bored of this game the more I play it, but right now its pretty fun!

950	1	a	Remember in Oblivion (Elder Scrolls Series) when you're in the dark brotherhood and you get to kill the house guests? This is a roided up version of that very short quest. But you can't be too blunt or obvious about your kills, no crouching with a sword this time, instead you've got to watch them, learn what they do... and proceed through your plan to ultimately sacrifice them to your 'father'.  Its a great game and I recommend everyone try it at least once.
1182	1	a	DO NOT miss a chance to pick up this game for the discounted steam price! I repeat! I mean cmon you play the son of Lucifer. the stealth mechanics are one of a kind and spot on, the story line is wonderful, there is loads of sublte, dark humour throughout the entire game. this game was very well planned out and put together! please play the first before you play the second. did i mention you play the son of lucifer. puzzle meets stealth, gorefest, with thrills and chills. its a must own. no real glitchs either. runs smooth and offers hours of fun.  8/10
2294	1	a	A lot of people's problems with this game are the optimisation and story, and to be honest, they aren't all that great. But if you can look past those, the graphics are nice-ish (with my system, I have to run it on minimal graphics, and even then it isn't the worst), the animations in my opinion are actually really good and the gunplay seems fairly solid, especially the heavy sniper.   Another part of the game I really enjoy is the stealth. I've seen a few reviews where they give it â¥â¥â¥â¥ but to me it seems like the AI are smart enough to track you down and at the same time, not being super-cosmic Ethan Brady sensing Norks. The takedowns are fun and actually pretty brutal, but to be honest, a little more detail (blood/gore) wouldn't have been bad.   The idea that you are guerilla fighters is really embedded through the fact that you are definitely not invincible. The hit and run style of fighting is almost your only option in the first 3 areas of Philly, until you gear up a little more.   All up I would say pick this game up when it's a little cheaper maybe, but if you can snag it on sale then you will absolutely enjoy yourself.

1053	0	a	Lucius, from what I knew of it, seemed like a great game. It had an interesting premise, the opening animatic looked great, and the idea of killing people to gain devil powers seemed cool. And it is, in theory. The game itself is awful. It's glitchy and even broken at places, the graphics aren't really much, and overall, if I was asked if I'd purchase it again, I wouldn't. You're left to figure out what to do on your own most of the time, with very vague, and very unhelpful clues. The controls are utter rubbish, and you're unsure of how to do anything most of the time. For many things, it's a trial and error kind of process, and while that in itself isn't such a bad thing, here, you must know certain things (such as not stepping in a bedroom, having to crouch just right to kill someone, or having to be just behind a certain object enough to complete an objective) in order to even complete a level. It's great for laughs, though, at various glitches and some deaths.  In short, it's a terrible game and I wouldn't recommend getting it unless you don't mind frustrating controls and poor gameplay in exchange for some confused laughs.

2543	1	a	A hate letter from 1998 filled with inexplicable design choices, such as removing control of your mouse cursor for 60 seconds when relatively common enemies cast spells on you. Overall, this game is aggressively annoying.
1815	1	a	It is free for the weekend so i try the game and it still is heavy on the machine and it got some minor bugs.. but for the 13 hours i played it plays like any other far cry game there is so its good for me, im gonna buy

2459	0	a	Having mixed feelings towards this game. It's not that it's a bad one. Just not well-made. From the creators of the dark, atmospheric, story-driven albeit a bit clumsy adventure Daemonica comes a dark, atmospheric, story-driven Inquisitorâ¦ but the RPG part and the duration made the whole clumsiness part exaggerated. Delve deep into the tedium of 1. pixelhunting! 2. stacking on bottles like a hobo junkie 3. collecting scalps 4. lengthy monotonous conversations 5. reeeeally slow walking 6. unskippable âI have to let you goâ dialogue whenever you accidentally click on your dog 7. spiders that poison you for 5 minutes with about the only remedy of going to the city and healâ¦ and did I mention slow walking? 8. broken balance with easy difficulty being worse off than hard (according to forums)  If you tell me now âbut it's a hardcore dialogue-rich RPG, what did you expect?â, please don't be like those people who mistake bad game design for a difficulty level. User-friendliness is not something for â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, it's a norm these days, and this game lacks a lot in this department.  Story-wise it's an interesting concept, being an inquisitor, collecting gossip and proof, uncovering crimes against faith â and these heretical rituals are kind of grim and do make you uneasy. I guess I'm about halfway through now, and decided to just use the cheat codes to get through the dungeons without madly running/crawling to the town and back.

2634	1	a	I played the GoG version of this game first. (So, don't be fooled by the time Steam is displaying :D)  tl;dr at the bottom  Let me say that this is one of the best games I  ever  played.  It is hard to compare this game to any other title... it has some sort of open world, a bit of RPG, a whole lot of an adventure....   It starts very strange and you don't have any clue what awaits you. But if you aren't afraid of that, you'll find yourself in a great adventure-thriller-detective-horror.... thingy.... o.O It's really hard to describe,  what  this game actually is.   The game has all sorts of moments. It is sometimes very creepy, sometimes ridiculus, exciting, surprising....  I really enjoied it and played the whole game within some days.   tl;dr

1560	0	a	Not bad in terms of the idea of the game. However, they could have made this game so much better with the storyline. As well as, they should have worked better for an open-world game. It was the same thing over and over with taking over the bases and all that. The graphics weren't bad, but the glitches were terrible. I waited for this game sice the lasr Homefront and it was not worth it. I give this game 5/10. Wait for the price to drop.

1952	1	a	Played abit, it isn't that bad. Although there are several lackness for texture, and weapons. Graphics itself is a mixed, the lighting is great but the texture can use improvement here especially the weapons texture. There are still some bugs, such as AI bugs. Overall, for a less than 1 year title and already dropped price, I can say it is fairly worth it. If you can get it on sale, it will be more worth.
2084	0	a	Like many others here, I have also had preformance issues. I well exceed the recommended specs, and it runs awfully. The game looks amazing for the most part, but what good is a sweet looking game if it runs like total crap. Maybe future patches will further optimize and improve frame rates, but as it stands right now it's unplayable for me.

293	1	a	I got this game as a gift, and oh boy I'm so happy about it.   The game's concept is simply amazing. You are pretty much the antichrist as a child and you kill people to please Lucifer and get stronger whilst not letting people find out about your real identity. The game is set up on a huge victorian-style mansion, with a lot of rooms to explore and designed in a way that it doesn't feel repetitive or confusing at all.   The gameplay  kind of mixes a sleath-ish style with an old-school game where you have to really search the rooms, collect objects and use them intelligently to complete each chapter. In fact, this game reminds me a lot of older games in the sense that it looks rather rough but presents an amazing gameplay experience.   The soundtrack  and voice acting were rather bad. The voice acting seems to be rather desynced with the model's mouth movements. It really seems as if the game was poorly dubbed from another language other than english. The soundtrack is rather repetitive and very uninspiring.   The achievements  are the best part of this game. They are rather easy to get but can be missed if the player doesn't pay attention. The only bad achievements are the 'I like this game' and 'I am addicted' ones, that the devs added to try to stretch the gameplay time. Fortunately there is a guide that teaches a method to work around them.  Overall this is an amazing game that is very underrated. You should probably buy it.

I can say this game at least gets a 8/10 and that's because it can also be a tad boring at times. The ending of the game was not cool, mostly because you are left hanging with the 'what happened?' and it isn't funny. But over all, I believe you should give it a try

99	1	a	This game is kind of interesting in a few ways. It reminds me of DOTA from Warcraft 3 in many regards, but on a small scale. I really only played the single player and it was kind of fun. I suppose if you can find a good deal on this game it is a worthwhile purchase, because you should get a few hours out of it and it is fun to kill time with every now and again. I just would not expect an amazing game.
1111	1	a	10/10
2848	1	a	Before I begin, I owned this on Xbox and recently started playing through the PC version.  I'm not sure I can say Deadly Premonition is good, but at the same time it is. I've used 'disgustingly average' to describe it before. Yet, I can't recommend it enough. Its basically Twin Peaks the game, in a sense.   If you like horror, or action, or story, this is a game for you. The game has many flaws. The driving sucks, the combat could be a little better, the squirrels make MONKEY noises. But, those make Deadly Premonition what it is.   This game is basically the definition of 'So bad it's good'
947	1	a	Darkness, evil and fun make this game a fantastic play. I love the aspect of being the evil protagonist along with kill everyone without getting caught. Highly recommended play, I only wish there were more games like this out there.
280	0	a	Game is incedibly unstable. It will slowdown and then crash if you break too many bottles. Did I mention there's an achievement for breaking bottles?  There's no manual save, so when the game crashes, you'll lose a lot of progress.  It controls poorly and perhaps worst of all, simply isn't all that fun. I can't recomend it.  EDIT: I've since finished the game and have softened a bit on it. The executions are creative if not necesaryily logical and the plot is coherent if unimaginative.   Between the instability and less than stellar gameplay, I still can't recommend it. It's the poster child of good idea, poor execution.  But if you get the game for free, and you're a fan of the Hitman series or hidden object games, it's worth a playthrough if you can get past the bugs.  Edit 2: And for you achievment hunters out there, Lucius has 2 time based acheivements. Play for 20 and for 40 hours. However, this game only takes about 10 hours to complete and that's if you're really taking your time. Each mission only has one way to solve it so the game has no replayability and the achievements force idling, but here's the kicker. Lucius can't even idle properly. If you alt+tab the window it doesn't count. Being at the menu doesn't count. You have to be in-game with the window in the foreground.  Yea.
2784	1	a	I seem to be one of the lucky few who has not experienced a crash or problem of any kind while playing this wonderfully strange game. The game itself is amazing in its unique way if you can get it to run. I highly recommend it as it's a game that exists in a class all its own. The characters are odd, different from one another, genuine, and full of quirk and personality. The story is intriguing and the music helps heighten the drama and mystery. It's like a really great, really strange TV show that you get to play through. Even the bad parts like the driving mechanics are enjoyable. It really feels like you're in a small town living the life of an eccentric FBI investigator. So, as long as you can get it to run properly, you're in for the weirdest treat available in gaming that I know of. Enjoy!

569	1	a	I'd give it a 7/10. It's about 7 hours of gameplay and plays like a horror Hitman. It's good fun, but def not worth $20. I'd say $10 is the right price.
2162	1	a	I went into the game not with very high hopes because from what i have seen people where getting bad fps, glitches all over the shop and bad graphics But I'm glad to say i have had none of that the game runs decent with not that bad fps drops and 96% of the time it stays at 60 fps.  For anyone wondering what setting im running it on im running on high at 1080p with vsync on pc specs: i7 5820k gtx 980 x2 in sli but i dont think this game has sli support so yeah (I have enabled it in nvidia inspector using the crysis 3 profile)  Game is really good fun and really impressed with the graphics as well they look amazing  however the game does need some patching before it will be 100% stable if you cant deal with stuttering i wouldnt buy it wait a few months or wait until its on sale because not everyone is able to run the game as well as i have been able to and you may not be as lucky as i was with it.   So good game but wait for a few months and or pick it up in a sale the summer sale isnt too far away and it will most likely be in it
1247	1	a	  Blood, cars, guns, cars with guns, explosions and, of course, zombies! What' not to like about this game. It has a decent campaign (4-5 hours), although it is kind of repetetive (no more than 5 type of missions), but every single one is satisfying.  The weapons feel great, the driving feels good and the camera may make you dizzy at first by there are 3 more option to change to.  *You have to play the game with a gamepad. The keypord controls are very clanky. Apart from the campaign there are to more mods to play, racing with others through zombies, and surviving waves of zombies. To sum up, fun game, worths the money, use gamepad.

If you can sit through horrible everything, it may get better farther in, but it sets a terrible first impression with terrible voice-acting, animations, story, and worst of all horrible gameplay. While it was a Diablo-Like, it felt more tedious than any other I've played. If you're a masochist, I recommend this game, otherwise please stay away.

It's most cardinal sin of all, and the one thing the game should have going for it, is the actual kills and puzzles are straightforward and bland. This trip to hell is not worth taking.

1222	1	a	Just drive back and forth until it feels right. When that doesn't happen, go make yourself some french fries and just keep goin until the screaming stops. When you're done with the fries, keep goin until your car is upgraded enough that you no longer slow down when the zombies become to thick. Do not play this game in real life unless you're sure there are zombies out on streets in your city. Apparently the military is too busy to kick some zombie â¥â¥â¥, so they have enlisted you to run over some zombies using all sorts of zany vehicles with many possible upgrades.     Just remember to keep goin!

2186	1	a	Edit: I've now ran an entire playthrough and have successfully completed the game on the standard difficulty so I figured I'd revisit this as I intended.   This might be the end of the Homefront franchise as we know it, if not forever. A disappointment I'll never get over. I wanted to love this game. Instead I tolerate it.  Initially I was scheptical about the jarring day one complaints and number of proposed bugs and issues many people seemed to be having that I simply wasn't. However after playing without issue for a few hours before taking a long break (a week or two) to allow some patching and otherwise cleaning up of the overall experience, I found that little had changed aside from that rediculous saving bug that occured every few minutes, forcing frames to drop to near zero as the game autosaved. I still experienced choppy visuals and framerate issues as well as god awful bugs like repeating or broken sound clips, xbox and PS4 controller prompts for buttons I'd recently seen a keyboard shortcut for, the usual tripe. There was nothing that prevented me from proceeding through the main campaign or the flashpoints but they were still everywhere.  Gameplay is thoroughly average, you capture bases and take territory, you kill some norks, you ambush some more norks, you use resistance boobytraps to launch norks thirty feet into the air, the game truly is just a run and gun affair with some not so nice stealth mechanics thrown in.  The gun play might feel floaty (I have aim assist off) and the recoil might seem excessive if you're used to current gen shooter mechanics- I'm looking at COD here, not ARMA3, so prepare for a vague learning curve on how weapons and the very basic cover system work together- though as a shooter it flops around like a fish out of water by comparison to superior releases in the genre.  The cut scenes and key character models are marvelous, but seem wasted when you look at the sub-par AI and the repetitive skins used for some of the civilians or non-essential fodder. Though I've not had any of the issues with people witnessing enemy vehicles simply not reversing when they hit walls etc, I have seen some less than stellar combat where enemies don't flank, they don't seem to adapt, they don't seem to think at all. They shoot at you, they duck, they run somewhere else thirty yards away, duck and shoot, and lets not forget the charging blindly at you around a corner deal. They sure like to rush you. Just like real combat! Not.  I'm getting a little ranty but I felt like given how hard this game has been nailed to the wall, I have to give it some credit, it went through a terrible development process and an even worse development cycle and it certainly shows on the rougher edges- but I DID have fun, and where the visuals are nothing ground breaking for 2016, I'd gladly say they're keeping up with many current shooters whilst not establishing any really new trends of their own.  TL;DR? Proceed with caution, read the reviews, check out up and coming patch notes and maybe try and grab this one on a sale. I don't feel it warrants a negative review but just barely earns a positive one. When you waited as long as I did for this game, only for it to get squeezed out of the digestive tract of a series of less than stellar studios or developers and handed on for someone else to clean up? Well it more than pains me to say it was thoroughly average.

649	0	a	  Cool concept. A point and click adventure game where you are the child of Lucifier sent to destroy everyone in your mansion. However, it isn't executed all that well. There is only one way to solve puzzles that require specific items and actions which are far too unclear. Also a lot of the time the game becomes 'click the correct pixel'. AI is also basically nonexistent. NPCs only walk along predefined paths and constantly get stuck.

1966	1	a	  Has it's issues? Yes. But seems that it was way worse than before and devs did hell of a job of fixing it. I'm running basically a 2012 high-end rig and have no problem running it at great details. Only thing that bothers me is basically the animations. I would say that even the price is reasonable comparing it some of every year 50$/â¬ piece of you know what games.  PS: Has a bit of a Dead Island spark to it (in the open world meaning).
2385	1	a	Checked it out for a bit during the free weekend so this will be more of a first impression instead of a review.   TLDR version: Overall seems like you could have a decent time with it but I'd wait for a 60%-75% discount before buying.    There seem to be a ton of things to do but just after around 1h of messing around in the first open area I could already feel the repetition in the core gameplay loop. It's just clear building, kill plebs, activate power switch, etc. The time sensitive 'flashpoint' missions that randomly pop up do add some variety but not sure if that's enough some 10+ hours into the game.   The shooting felt fairly average. Didn't have any real issues but I also could not feel any crazy impact when mowing down enemy troops. That may have something to do with early game unmoded weaps being kinda meh tho. Seems like there is some pretty deep weapon customization so shooting may be a lot more fun later down the line.  The silent protag constantly getting talked at by every pleb he meets is fairly detrimental to the story as far as I'm concerned. Can't say much more about it since I only did the first few missions tho.   Didn't see any of the bugs people keep posting about but that may be later in the game. For me it was a completely smooth experience.   Overall I really don't know why this is rated 'mostly negative' on Steam. It's not a top of the line shooter but you can still have quite a bit of fun here. Will probably buy it after the next price drop.  
310	1	a	âââââ - 'Worth your time, give it a bash'  PROS: -Playing as a villian is great fun, especially the spawn of satan. -Killing people in various ways has never been as enjoyable as it is in Lucius, almost hitman like. -This game is funny, mainy due to its faults but Lucius does not take itself seriously at all. -You have to use your innotive, the game does not tell you where to go, instead you must listen carefully and pay attention to your notes. Getting used to the map is also crucial as the house is big! - Although the story is corny and a little far fetched it worked and it was just like a tacky horror movie. - Fun achievements, the type that make you want to go back and play certain missions again.  CONS: - Its unpolished for sure, I dont really mind it as it played into the games enjoyable charm but animations are poor and controls are clunky. - Grapically the game is not brilliant  VERDICT?  An entirely daft premise and not exactly good delivery but the game is somehow one the most enjoyable ive played, which is worrying cause you play as a serial killer.

Played properly, it's quite enjoyable. There were some minor bugs, but I had only one that was substantial and prevented me from completing a zone, but it didn't impact the storyline. The game did have some stuttering issues, but they were fixed the first day.  A lot of people are complaining that it's not Doom, but I don't think it was intended to be. You can't just run in guns blazing and expect to survive. I played it as a stealth game and had a blast. It requires you to use your NPC comrades to create a squad. They would pin down the enemies and I would run around behind and pick them off one at a time.  Played the way it was intended, this game is a lot of fun.

2594	1	a	This game took me a while to get into, honestly. The PC port is not fantastic, and it would crash on me frequently, until I found a fix that would make it crash every few hours instead of every hour. So, y'know, still frequent crashes. Also, the gameplay isn't great, with the driving being especially terrible and the combat kind of feeling superfluous. However, the story itself is pretty great, with twists and turns that you don't quite expect. It's campy and great. I can't heartily actually recommend everyone play it, but if it sounds cool to you, give it a shot.

2705	1	a	I have purchased Deadly Premonition on every platform it has been released. The game's director Swery is the perfect kind of crazy, and he's a really sweet guy, and you should all support his work. His games aren't perfect, but they're beautiful windows into his soul. This world we live in does not deserve Swery, and he is a gift. Buy this game and D4, please.

2923	1	a	If you like campy movies and can get past the ps2 level graphics, Deadly Premonition has enough charm to keep you interested.
1726	1	a	i have had fun with the game sort of still good betterthan the last but be warned this game is realy bugy and is better with controler but have as much fun with what ever you buy. :{D
345	1	a	This game is pretty cool, funny to play, even if you will dafinetely need a guide to finish it. But seriously what are that achievements? 20h and 40h for a 7-8 hours game is insane. Maybe if there were more ways to kill or idk, multiple versions of the campaign. Anyway, buy the game, it is good.

1285	1	a	Have player through the campaign. My review is: Absolutely fantastic!!!! 10 out of 10 as a platformer. Addicting gameplay, good graphics, great variety of missions and adversaries. I could not wish for more. This game is simply a must buy for everyone who likes zombies and racing.
903	0	a	Recomend or not. It is hard to decide with this game.  The graphics arn't that good, but for the price I have seen worse. It is a very linear game with not that many options of what to do or not. The majority of the achievements are easy and fun to get if you ignore the 20 hour and 40 hour achievement. The game is much to short to get them without wasting electricity of the pc keeping the game active while you find something more interesting to do.   The ways you have to kill people is midly creative and fun to find out, but that is pretty much where the fun ends.

2666	1	a	I came to this game, as the creator did... directly after watching all of Twin Peaks. I had never seen the show, so I found it more than a little queer to play a game which cribbed so heavily from it; Not to say it doesn't build into it's own thing. It's very unimpressive for a few hours...then... I COULD NOT STOP PLAYING! Francis York Morgan is one of the most dryly hilarious characters ever in a videogame, at least some of which is intentional.  The most annoying parts where driving, especially in rain, and the one hang-up when you are literally fishing for a clue in the investigation. Even though I was sitting there like an â¥â¥â¥ losing at a roulette wheel repeatedly, I had to know what happened next in this surreal, unpredictable story. It's like the game was written/acted in the 90's with 2003 graphics. It's horrible as a game and highly recommended as a cross-cultural curiosity. The fact that the protagonist talks to a voice in his head, which can double as you, the player, is insanely brilliant. I want to play a solid, polished, 90 metascore game now, but York is calling me back for a second playthrough, 'Are you there, Zach?'

1521	1	a	An urban warfare variation of the Far Cry formula with a better level design, but overall more clunky.  Pros: - Good level design, especially some environmental puzzles in some of the strike points (think towers in Far Cry). They get better as you progress in the game. My favourite one: Hospital where you have to find medical supplies before unlocking the point. - The city is a much better environment for the Far Cry formula than a jungle or mountains, in my opinion. In Far Cry I found the travelling between bases and towers boring, here it's fun and you have to be wary of your surroundings all the time. - Vaulting over obstacles and mantling on higher platforms is used naturally everywhere - The writing in the later parts of the game - Voice acting - Diverse environments. From rich villas to gassed and desolate industrial zones  Cons: - The shooting is not very satisfying and some weapons behave strangely. A fully upgraded silenced SMG has more recoil than a LMG, for example - Rudimentary stealth with few options. Stealth is required as in some maps if you raise an alarm, the game spawns soldiers infinitely, unless you hide. But the tools you have at your disposal are lacking. - The movement system (vaulting, mantling) is quite slow, the PC feels like an elephant. Fast movement feels more fluid, see Dishonored or Titanfall - Writing in the earlier parts of the game is cliched and quite bad. I feel it gets better in later parts, where the situation is more desperate. - Some bugs (wrongly placed objects, levitating NPCs, even a show-stopping bug in the main quest, that was luckily solved by reloading)  Overall I recommend the game if the idea of a Far Cry formula in a city appeals to you. Just be ready for some clunkiness and a few bugs.

1231	1	a	Great Story, but repeats it's missions pretty fast. Many Vehicles, extremely huge masses of Zombies and nice weapons for every situation.   Also a great Race Gamemode with destroying the other racers and a Arena-Survival Gamemode where you can try to survive. (Obvious, isn't it? xD)  I recommend this game for friends of Racers that like to drive over zombies in a bird's eye view.

2716	1	a	A game where your salary is based on how many monsters you kill, nice story, the best combat system since resident evil 3, totally underrated. Running smoothly on intel hd graphics without using any fixes while the pc masterracef@gs keep whining about crashes/bugs/stuttering.  10/10 would drink their tears.

777	1	a	An interesting game concept; play as a demonic possessed kid and kill off the household. It's kinda like playing the Sims if you were Satan.  You free roam around the house looking for a way to kill your next target, set everything up, then let the brutal cutscene commence. Most of the puzzles involve just setting up the murder in the house, which the game kinda helps you with so its not like you run around clicking everything. Some of the murders are a bit mild, like you just poisen them and watch them die. Then you get to most of the others which escalate to the level of sawing a guys face in half with a saw. So if you like gore, this might get you off a bit.  Though the game is short and can be completed pretty quickly, its best to wait for a sale to buy. Even though the game is kinda amusing and interesting, it's content is still not worth $20.

1071	0	a	The game looked really promising and it gets to be really cheap on sales (around 90 cents), but it's so buggy that messes up the game.  You literally have to start over chapters due to the game being extremely buggy and causes you to be unable to process the to story.  Cons:  -The facial expressions are the worst. -Memory wipe power was worthless. -Some controls are clunky. -Most abilities are lame. -The House / Enviroment design in the game is rather poor. -The game offers no replayability. -The story is very short, you can beat the game in around 2-3 hours (if you can stand playing it for that much). -Too linear. -Boring concept.  Pros:  -You can ride a tricycle on your way to commit murder.

1716	1	a	Not as bad as I have heard. Gameplay felt like Dying Light but with North Koreans :D  I didn`t have any performance issues and could run the game on max settings on a 3 years old GPU.
