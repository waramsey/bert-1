0	This game has almost no single player content, except skirmish mode against AI. It is like practice for multiplayer, but there is no online community and there hasn't been for years. Waste of money.
1	Love this game so much. Don't have anything good to say that hasn't already been said. Only downside is the lack of online community means you are limited to playing with friends and bots.  That said.... don't buy it unless it's on sale. =(
2	Pretty fun MOBA and really underrated. Wish more people played it. 
3	Pros: &gt; BEAUTIFUL models and graphics &gt; The music isn't annoying &gt; Many maps &gt; While few characters to play (10 ain't too bad), each has a large tree of abilities to develop &gt; I found it quite easy to pick up the games main concepts and strategies &gt; Pretty cheap to pick up  Cons: &gt; Dead community &gt; Too few items to purchase &gt; Kinda slow paced I guess &gt; No tutorial  If you got someone else to play this with then there isn't much to complain about regards to the whole community being dead. But it's good, basically a simpler Dota 2,  &gt; without Russians
4	This game is like League of Legends, DOTA 2, Heroes of the Storm and nothing like them. It has a slow, deliberate gameplay where you always have the option of running away, but seldom do. This often gives the feeling of tactics more than a click-fest. You could have given up the defense and backed off, but you took a stand and won (or died heroically). There are only 10 heroes, but it is impossible to buy all abilities of a demigod during one match. The item list is a bit short, split between equipment (~6x6 low to medium-powered items) and artifacts (~12 late-stage heavy hitters). The heroes are all rendered as high-quality models, and the maps are plentiful. Add in the 4 different victory conditions and matches can be very different. I like the feeling of control and the well thought-out hero concepts. I mean, one of the demigods is a giant walking fortress that shoots arrows, catapults and magic tower blasts, slotting into the defense grid :).
5	I really wish Demigod was a free to play game with a better server and community, it's a fun MOBA except you will probably wait 1-2 hours before you can start a game that is 3v3. The community just isn't there because the servers are so weak, but the game is very fun.
6	I tried LOL at one point and I'm in the Heroes of the Storm Alpha but I just wasn't very good or had any idea what I was doing with these MOBA style games. Then my friend introduced me to this one and it was awesome. After the first battle I had a great grasp on what I was doing and pretty much stomped face for our remaining games. The graphics are nice, the characters are diverse and each one plays differently. My favorite thing are the levels. They are all very different. Instead of the same map with the same things just moved around in different spots, each arena is a new setting, the layout is different along with the placement of the various buildings, flags, and portals, and the ambient surroundings are somethign as well. It's a nice change. It forces you to rethink your path, strategy somewhat for each arena you play on. If you like League and Dota and other MOBA games, definitely get this one... and then play it with me!
7	A game that was so far ahead of its time that others are still trying to catch up. Beautiful graphics that still surpass any other MOBA out. Nice sound track and great sound effects. With a surround system the battles pound.(When Rook starts swinging his hammer, you feel it.) Not to mention, Christopher Lee as the narrator!  There is a small (and seemingly growing} group of players on this one. Join the community forums to find players that really enjoy it. Also there is a mod pack that absolutely crucial for this game, again see the steam community forums for details of where to get it.  (http://forums.demigodthegame.com/412017)   I have had this one for a while and I love that it came out in 2009 and I am still having so much fun with it. With the mod pack(which fixes some AI issues) the game provides an amazing single player experience and with a full roster in multiplayer the game owns. Inspite of Dota's massively superior numbers and the full weight of Valve's marketing, Demigod eats Dota's lunch. (Also, please note that I bought the Box version on release- then got the Steam version when it became available. Only mention it because the Steam hours played listed are not accurate of my play time with this one.)  Be advised though, you should consider this as a 'Single Player' purchase. Do that and you will enjoy the ride.
8	I only ever played the Single-player mode:   I really enjoyed this as a strategy game. I was surprised to see it is labelled as a MOBA but I've never played any other MOBA games.  Easy to learn Good for a casual player immersive unique story and game elements I think the current price is still worth it.
9	Demigod is a DOTA-like game that while providing a generally pleasing take on the genre fails to provide a complete experience and a number of game breaking issues means that most players will never truly enjoy it.  Demigod is a mix of strategy and role playing action, you pick from a list of demigods, either strong damage dealing assassins or minion summoning generals each with a unique set of skills and then do battle on a large arena as a team against another team of either human or AI controlled deities. As you kill enemies and do battle you earn currency and experience allowing you to level your demigod up through a branching skill-tree as well as purchase a variety of upgrades at your homebase, anything from stat boosting wearables to potions and massive faction boosts are available. At the end of a match all is reset and you get to do it all over again against a new foe or controlling a new hero.  Demigod makes a number of rookie mistakes however. The lack of any sort of tutorial makes the game difficult to learn and the single-player matches against the AI does in no way prepare you for the multi-player. As a heavily team dependent game it is quite possible for a single inexperienced player to lose the match regardless of his teammates leading to a generally hostile community.  The greatest mistake Demigod makes however, is in the multi-player. Connection issues plague every matchup and it requires an enormous amount of patience to play a full game. For a game that is so heavily multi-player based this should be a complete deal breaker for any potential buyers.  The game is fairly good looking and the sound and music is pleasant enough creating an enjoyable atmosphere.  All in all Demigod is a decent MOBA that provides you with a unique set of Generals and Assassins to control and has all the makings of an enjoyable game. The lack of single-player components and the massive connection issues makes me unable to recommend this to anyone however as even the most avid MOBA aficionado will be hard pressed to enjoy a game he cannot play.
10	For being marketed as 'the first commercial MOBA' it's not half bad for being as half-â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ as it is. You're right, it is pretty dynamic, not as challenging to pick up as Dota, and gives you some basic flexibility with your auto-throwaway units, which you can upgrade (along with towers) at your citadel. Despite there being only ten heroes, there's more gameplay options with the 'generals' (spawn your own minions) or 'assassin' (nuker) hero class categories.  *sighs*  That said, the game received no patches or additional content post-release. Even  at  release, there were very, very few maps with no tutorial or story campaign. So, basically, you jump right in with NPC fights or buggy, laggy online games (which, as you might imagine, do not exist) with the same limited map pool. While the game had the  capacity  for mod content, it's not like the Steak Workshop or Creator Kit was around when this came out, so there is no amateur content either to be found either unless you want some very basic UI tweaks.  I think, probably, the most aggravating part of this game is that what few maps there are don't really allow for progress like Dota does with  one  map. It's like Unreal Tournament (2004), if you create a game with just AI players, you can stay at your base for five hours if you wanted to, come back, everything is exactly how it was when you left it. Heroes do not have as significant presence/impact without reaching the maximum level. The gameplay is just...bland. There's no hiding, very limited potential for ganking, no terrain advantages/disadvantages, hidden items...No meaningful progress happens on the map without steamrolling with sheer numbers and, even then, that progress is easily reversed back to a stalemate automatically by creeps in no time flat. Die, kill me, anything. Games HAVE to end at some point.  Whereas some really good older titles were given new patches and content by their publishers to bring them back to being contenders with Steam re-releases, this was an already mediocre game that did not get that attention.  This is just the absolute embodiment of lost potential. 
11	By itself this is a great game, it's fun to play but there is so much wrong with it and it lacks content.   There is no explaination on how to play, no single player story or campaign and multiplayer is dead. There are just a few maps and on hard difficulty the game still is very easy.  Next to that I seem to have hit some bugs that I did not have in the first week of playing, For no apperant reason I have lost my profile and my single player progress is gone. The game worked fine for the first week, but now the keyboard does not work anymore and I am not able to click any of in game buttons. I can only make the character walk about and attack, but not upgrade or buy items.
12	I REALLY wish i could tell you that Demigod is a great game, but the game was doomed since it's launch.  To explain things, Demigod has some unique characters that are fun to play, and the game offers some strategy mechanics to players who are more comfortable with RTS games than MOBAs, i could easily tell you that this is the easiest moba out here, and that Demigod is a curious blend of all these mechanics in an epic warhammer-esque way.  THIS IS WHERE THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ HITS THE FAN  The game has got NO UPDATES SINCE RELEASE, meaning it's incredibly buggy and unbalanced at some point (assasin demigods are WAY more powerful than their general counterpart). Also a few years back (around it's release) pirates hacked the server service for the game, stardock, said pirates had acess to all the user's information, some of which includes credit card data. Gas powered and Stardock didn't do â¥â¥â¥â¥ about it and decided to abandon the game.   In other words: no online multiplayer unless you use third party software, and usually people who use these on demigod are hacking.  This game would've got an easy 8/10 if it wasn't for the developpers losing interest in the game, this could've been a competitor to league of legends, but then again they used an extremely old internet service for their game (stardock was already known to suck, the reason why they were chosen is because of budgetary reasons).  And no, the single player mode doesn't save this game: no campaign, no backstory, nada. Single player is basically a 'play against AI' mode, in which the AI is absolutely horrible and will get easily destroyed by anyone who auto-attacks them.  this gets a 3/10 for me, i really hate to say this, but you â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up Gas Powered.
13	This is a game that you cannot just start green and expect to have a short easy game, average time for each map is 1 hour. The combinations of friendlies and enemies that can give you some interesting games makes it always fun. This game is better played with a few people as the AI can be very frustrating sometimes.
14	I want to enjoy this game...I mean I REALLY want to (as someone who loves Mobas like LoL and Dota 2, I can say this game DOES have one of the more unique skill trees you can build) but the regerstartion system is complete garbage. I actually removed this game (along with From Dust for the same reason) because I couldn't even get to the start menu due to the registrations. It's 2016 people, get with the times. Maybe instead of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ your pants of online pirates, you should be focusing your time into making your game playable.
15	Pretty fun little moba type game. I'd definitely give it a shot if you are into mobas and want to try something a little bit different.
16	Fun game for multiplayer. It is to bad they don't have more maps
17	First off, let me state that when Demigod was released, it's multiplayer was pretty much broken due to the publisher insisting on doing the netcode and sucking at it hardcore. This issue has since been resolved, and is no longer an issue; the multiplayer works just fine now, no real problems.  Now, from there, let's get into a few aspects of the game itself:  Demigod is a MOBA style game, where you play as a single hero/champion/demigod/whatever style character who starts off kinda flimsy, and gradually levels up, fighting large armies of enemy units with the goal of defeating the enemy team. Thing LoL, HoN, DotA, Smite, Dawngate and so on.  Where Demigod leaves the rest of the pack, is that it focuses very heavily upon a small number of highly customizable and remarkably in depth characters, rather than a large number of half-done characters which is par for the course for the rest of the genre. Yes, everyone loves pudge and mundo, but they really simply aren't on par with pretty much anything in Demigod, and the Rook is just kind of a game ender in that contest =P  The next part where Demigod leaves traditional MOBA-style gameplay behind, is it focuses very heavily upon strategic assets and tactical control; holding onto flags is a game-changer, and you can upgrade or add to your army, with a remarkably large wealth of global upgrades for your whole team and even your minions.  You heard me right; other mobas rely on the concept of both sides having equal minions for the most part, a perpetual stalemate where the players are the only force that changes the tide of war, and minions are simply an exp/gold payday. In Demigod, however, you can capture the portals from an enemy that spawns their minions, upgrade your own minions, or even purchase new minions to be added to waves, such as healers or catapultasauri (yes, catapult dinosaurs, epix win, I know).  Another major part about Demigod is that the only gold comes from passive gold gain, and from killing Demigods/towers. How does this work? Well, mines are strategically set up around the map, and these can be captured to steal the gold away from the enemy team. Think Dawngate, but significantly more potent to hold onto more mines and territory, but harder to keep the strategic parts long term.  Yet another neat feature are items which can be purchased from points earned in any game, wherein these points last perpetually between games. Once you buy one of these special items, you can dump it onto your demigod at the start of a new round for free... but you only get one out of a list of about 20. It's an interesting feature, to say the least.  Again, we have another major feature that changes Demigod from all of it's competitors... virtually every single other MOBA out there has your character max all their skills out at maximum level. In Demigod, you instead get a much larger skill-tree (think closer to diablo-2), and will have to pick and choose which abilities to level over time. In this manner, the same character can play very differently from one match to the next... in one match, Sedna may be a general carrying around an army of minions and aura items, spamming heals out; in the next match, she might be a remarkably high-speed assassin with strong burst and self healing/regeneration. As such, your character choice has a significant impact upon the game, but you have a lot more leeway after character select than in most other MOBAs which can often be decided simply based on team composition.  The last major part about Demigod which sets it apart from the crowd, is it actually has a wealth of options for adjusting the game's difficulty and gameplay for each game played, and a remarkably robust AI. Co-op in Demigod is still farther along than even League of Legends, and most other MOBAs don't even have a co-op mode at all.    End verdict:  Demigod fails in a few minor ways, but not by a lot. Some of it's strengths make it a good game, but not a good MOBA for serious pro-level PvP. It's well worth the money for what it is, however, and it's probably the single best MOBA-style option out there for people who want to play co-op with their friends rather than PvP. Is it the best MOBA out there? No, but it's definitely one of the better ones and well worth looking into. Just keep in mind that the multiplayer community is kind of dead these days, so bring your own friends.  Overall, it deserves a good 75-85%, with variation for personal taste and whether you have friends to play with or not.
18	It's sad that this game is so well designed, and you look at League of legends and realize that it is such a crappy game compared to this. This game just has so much more triumph when playing it.
19	Why the hell do I have to register for a game I own on Steam. This makes the game unplayable for me since I must have done so years ago when I bought it but now I have no idea what my account was and the serial number is already registered. â¥â¥â¥â¥ stardock.
20	I have actually played this a lot before getting the Steam version (I got it on CD when it came out). This game is a lot of fun and I hope they come out with a sequel.
21	To be honest, it is not worth to buy unless your friends have bought this game already or you like play with BOT only. This game is too old to play multiplayer match.  No more developing and upgrading, only 10 heroes to chosen. Easy to build equipment set because not much equipment to choose First MOBA I have played, though I hate MOBA :(
22	highly underrated gem.
23	Really good game, lots of replay factor. Great for coop, but only a small singleplayer campaign.
24	its a pretty fun moba i have always thought the genre was interesting however i never actually wanted to play with other people and this caters to that perfectly, you can play your own solo offline tournaments against the bots and its loads of fun not to mention a wide selection of heroes and if you are interested in the multiplayer aspect i think you can still play with some people especially if you have a friend who has it.
25	I've been told this is very similar to League of Legends and Dota and various other things, though I haven't played the former. However I can say that I have played Dota 2 and find it incredily difficult to understand what is going on especially with the lack of a half-deent tutorial. Onto Demigod - This game for me is the perfect starting point into this genre, if you find the aformentionned games have too much of a learning curve.  I have to say I enjoy this game very much, it's reasonably fast-paced, though you may wish to take a bit of time to get to know your favourite character and the various items/upgrades that are in the game (which are easy to access and understand, unlike dota with it's various item 'trees'.  The Environments are beautifully realised in scale and really work well with the 'story' or if you like the 'setting' of the game being that various Demigods are battling it out and the victor will become a God and rule over the others. The way the environments are designed resemble a form of game 'board' like Chess or Labyrinth which just works well especially with symmetry that is involved.  Even if you are not a fan of this genre, I would recommend this game based on its reasonable learning curve, visuals and soundtrack along with playability. An all-round great experience.
26	excellent, and versatile game! Lot of players for multiplayer. Give it a try! You won't regret it.
27	A lot of games out there are excellent. The problem lies when some of them get overlooked for reasons beyond their control or through horrific consumer tastes! Iâm shining the spotlight on some overlook gems starting with Demigod. I chatted with Bert Bingham (Associate Producer on Demigod), now of Wargaming, about the project from its inception to its troubled launch and beyond.  Check my in depth interview with Bert Bingham on Demigod, MOBAs and the future   http://www.permanent-beta.net/interviews/2015/3/18/interview-demigod 
28	This is honestly a good game that just got overshadowed with the release of League of Legends. Once that happened, it just couldn't compete with Leagues F2P model. If you overlook the lack of online players, this game is seriously fun to play with friends. The graphics are much higher quality then League of Legends, Dota 2, Heroes of Newerth, etc. And the gameplay is solid.  TRY IT OUT !!!  ENVOY RATED: 7/10
29	You can play as a giant castle. NEED I SAY MORE? 
30	Very fun with stylish graphics. Only thing lacking is a single player campaign, which is to be expected from this type of game. But, it is still worth playing.
31	Stardock is the most mediocre of companies. They absolutely ruined this game with their ineptitude. I would recommend avoiding the company at all costs. The game was excellent but the publisher ruined it by being so damn cheap and shortsighted. Now it's dead. Great.
32	Even though I have only played this alone, I like this game. I wanted it when it was on the shelves of the big box store and it drew me back into Steam and playing on PC.  Even though at times it does not seem to make a difference as to the effort you put into your skill tree or trying to take a strategic point over and over, it does beg the question if the gameplay is different against humans rather than AI (and I'll admit to not reading any documentation if there is any). The premise is simple in that you grab your legion, secure some portals and wipe out the opponents 'base'. And while doing so, set up defensive structures and level up your DemiGod. But still, it is an interesting arena style game, with legions at your bidding and lots of eye candy in the creature models.
33	An incredible game. I'm not quite sure how to describe it really. Far ahead of its time, shunned for being TOO advanced, this masterpiece is quite possibly the single best game ever made. Nothing does anything better than Demigod. NOTHING. I have ascended. Join me.
34	This game gives me a stark erection!
35	Very playable, nice graphics, enough demigods to choose from, each with specific skills. A lot of fun in multiplayer with friends or solo skirmish. I bought 4-pack and it rocks.
36	Very fun in both single and multiplayer but there isnt a lot of people online so I reccommend getting it with friends.
37	Played this game when it was released and really enjoyed it
38	I regret the times, when I couldn't play this game in it's prime, when tournaments were alive. But I don't regret buying digital copy now. Back in 2008, when I read about the game, DotA Allstars was already a thing you need to be aware of if you play games. And I was indeed aware. I tried the thing and got bored pretty quickly. Something was amiss. Something didn't want me to enjoy the game, and I felt out of place, when I heard praise about this new exciting genre like MOBA. When I read about Demigod I got a little flame of hope lit up in me. Everything from background of characters to the name of the game and a little story behind already was to my liking. But would the gameplay keep up with that? I wasn't sure. Back in a day, when that game came out I hadn't good internet connection, but I could play via LAN, so we had the game on our rigs. And we had a blast of it. You know the feeling, when you play a game, that let's you dissolve into the process, to feel zen. That's one of that kind of games for me. What DotA couldn't possibly achieve (cause of this is unknown) Demigod did for me. My friends are trying to convey through words why they like it more than other MOBAs, but I think it's not possible. For me there's no actual reason (or list of them) I can name to describe why I'm never bored or never annoyed by Demigod. Some say that the thing is in variation, or quality, or balance, or in quantity of content. I'd say none of it matters, yet everything in this mosaic of attributes just needs to be alligned with your feeling of what's right. If you're ever wondering, whether should you buy it or not - first make sure you have friends to play with. Then consider your wallet. And lastly take a chance if you will. And maybe you will become one of us, the Demigods.
39	now one of my favourite RTS. a great classic that keeps you captivated the entire round. the down side is that the online matchmaking is one of the worst. fun to play against the A.I. or possibly friends in a private match. its an extremely underrated game. definatly recomend buying it. hoping for a sequal with bettering online.
40	This game paved the way for LOL and DOTA! Give it some respect FFS!
41	Vshe norm
42	Still a beginner I really like this MOBA. Unclean OOZE Beast forever!
43	No bad for a moba but I would recommend Heroes of the Storm first.
44	I enjoy the game a lot. I will just play a match, usually on a big map and it's an enjoyable few hours. The only negative for me is that they haven't added anything new, there should be a DLC with new maps and Demigods but there isn't and probably never will be. Still if you get it on sale it's really cheap and good to take your mind off some 50 hour game for a bit.
45	Fun. Balanced. Multiplayer. Nuff said. Now go play.
46	You need to log in to a stardock account everytime you want to play. Absolutely disgusting.
47	Do not buy this game if you want to play online multiplayer. It is so horribly bugged and impossible to get a game with friends going - the game appears to be abandoned by the creaters. It's a shame too: the game is actually quite fun when it was working.  
48	When I was little, this game looked like the â¥â¥â¥â¥ and I was so excited to play it, but my parents never let me get it or had a computer that could run it. However, when I grew up and remembered this game, I quickly realized that this game was definitely not the â¥â¥â¥â¥. It just lacks in variety, and the combat feels clunky and slow-paced. It's not a bad game and it's fun to play, but it's not doto or lol. However, I lost a lot of respect for the devs of Demigod when I learned about their attitude in some media they published, idr if it was an interview or what. But basically, the devs were like 'we're going to beat those guys at league of legends, our game is better, it has more potential', and then when they failed, they blamed it on logistic issues at launch and etc. I mean, cmon, league is huge and very well polished as a game, and Demigod is not much more than an amateur game. Nevertheless, the devs did do a pretty good job with the game as it is, and it is quite fun to play once in a while.   P.S. I had a huge crush on queen of thorns when I was going through puberty. After puberty I realized that I was a fool.
49	I just think its a terrible game. Not much more to say than the truth.
50	Even on sale this game is an unfortunate waste of money. No online community and its a MOBA, so you get single player or you can play with friends. This was true last year as well as today. It is def a fun moba, maybe if they made it free and changed the pay style to match that of DOTA or LOL they could revive it, but that means they would have to support it again and I'm sure the devs have moved on lol.  Dont buy this game expecting to play online multiplayer unless you have specific friends who want to play with you.
51	I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing love this game! I had it on disc before I got into steam and sunk so many hours into it, its so amazing and needs more attention.
52	Boring. Hard to understand.
53	Down't buy it , the developers have quit this game , And now there is no servers .There is only single-pleyer
54	Packing order. HoN My poop Dota LoL 300Heros DEMIGOD!!!
55	Perfect game and very fun to play, could use a update to with new gods / Maps.
56	An underrated gem. Incredibly fun single-player. If you are looking for a MOBA-esque experience that is fun alone, this is it.
57	My first MOBA that I had ever played and the first and only one I loved until I got my hands on Heroes of the Storm (HOTS) Closed Beta.   Compared to HOTS, Demigod can't really be compared because it plays so differently than HOTS and many other MOBAs.   Its characters are so diverse, in my opinion (imo), that character fatigue is highly unlikely. Each chnaracter clearly has different strategies they use and can be modified to fit the players style or the shifting nature of battle.  The graphics are still as good as I remember them and the fact that its still really good, IMO, compared to many of the current generation of games really impresses me.  The gameplay is very skill based and requires a good amount of play time to really master, which I haven't.  The audio is the only part I say is dated but the fact that I still enjoy listening to the hero speak as I battle is really nice and brought back a lot of my past times playing the game.  Over all this is a game that I would be more than willing to keep playing even if I have to get my own personally owned server to play it, which most likely won't happen, this is due to the games only true issue, imo, the weak servers for multiplayer.
58	7.8 Hours spent trying to get it to work still doesn't.
59	MOBA games are meant to be smooth and responsive, and sadly, this game isn't. It also has an EXTREMELY SMALL community, which does not bode well for a MOBA.
60	Forces you to create an account at a third party database to play a game on steam, don't do it
61	No longer working on my Windows 10 system, tried reinstalling but there was no change in behaviour.
62	YOU CAN PLAY AS A GIGANTIC EFFIN CASTLE DUDE  IF THAT DON'T GET YOU ROCK HARD THEN GET YOUR DOC TO CHECK YOUR PULSE BECAUSE YOU MIGHT BE DEAD  JUST LIKE THIS GAME AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
63	If you love DOTA, LOL, or any of those arena style games you'll enjoy this one! I just wish that they'd make a sequel.
64	This game had barely any single player content (could've at least put a campaign), and hte multiplayer community is dead
65	No single player content, nobody on multiplayer. Waste of money.
66	nice fast gameplay
67	I have no idea what i'm doing.
68	Was fun when it was released, multiplayer was unlike anything I had played, played many a game with friends and was a great experience. If they released this with Steamworks and bugfixes it would be in my most played games. Until then I don't recommend buying.
69	Steam's stupid system does not allow just to 'vote', you have to comment as well. This is the comment..
70	- plenty of gold! (played it for 20 mins and I got more than 60k gold. items are relatively expensive too.) - uncomfortable camera POV - heroes take control of minions (which is quite original) - takes time to get familiar with HUD - every interaction I make seem to be delayed for ~0.5 secs, and I was doing single play  not bad. worth giving a try if you're MOBA or AOS enthusiasts, but the whole multiplayer sessions seem to died out. 6/10 
71	Remember when Chris Taylor's name attached to something was a positive, and not a kiss of death? Well if you played Demigod you got to experience the exact turning point in that relationship with the world.  Although maybe Space Siege was worse/first. I always forget that one.  Anyway Demigod is what happens if you take a LoMa game and slice off features, polish, roster, and anything even remotely charming from it and then ship it in a Gearbox-like cloud of hype that never materializes or is outright fabrication. Don't buy this, I'm unable to get a single â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game of this going and this genre is on the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ rise/the game costs $1 right now.

Anyway Demigod is what happens if you take a LoMa game and slice off features, polish, roster, and anything even remotely charming from it and then ship it in a Gearbox-like cloud of hype that never materializes or is outright fabrication. Don't buy this, I'm unable to get a single â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game of this going and this genre is on the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ rise/the game costs $1 right now.
73	didn't play long but it basically looks like a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ MOBA.
74	is this doto?
75	Okay so I got this game and the mouse won't work the curser just says in one place on the screen so I just paid for nothing maybe it was just me or maybe other people have had this issue as well not sure but if there's a fix hopefully it gets sorted
76	top shelf MOBA that needs a pop. boost badly :o(
77	HOLY â¥â¥â¥â¥ING â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS GAME IS â¥â¥â¥â¥ING TERRIBLE! I GAVE SOMEONE A LUCKY EGG ON POKEMMO FOR THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥?!?!?! LEAGUE OF LEGENDS/DOTA RIP OFF. 0/10 DO NOT BUY.
78	Blows.
79	the cursor doesnt move just sits still. i was able to get through things by moving it until what i wanted to click highlighted but found no way to fix the issue. waste of 5$
80	I liked this game when it first came out. It never made it though. People weren't, and aren't, playing it. If you can get it for a couple bucks it's worth a playthrough on single player. Since the community is dead though I can't reccommend this game.
81	I've played League of Legends, DOTA 2 and Demigod. I didn't realize that demi-god was simliar till these games till I first loaded it up. I thought it was just a unique RTS game. I wish it would've been. The gameplay is fairly dull with several characters standing out as much more powerful than others. I used one character to outrange an enemies tower and minions and harass them until I got the gold I needed to just destroy them.   There's a good mix of character abilities but they are limited characters and choices because there some abilities that you need in order to really play well. If you are sick of League or DOTA. I suppose you can pick this up but I only put 37 hours into it and I really pushed myself to do that.
82	very very nice co-op game, with friends, Multi or even single with bot allies. Developer's abandonment of it is a real shame. no cards or real attention given to it. However, there is a wonderful MOD in the forum to add more content, items, and balance (AI is really nice after applying patch), the in-game achievements you can attempt to achieve (ANd they are many and hard) is a great single player incentive or goal, as is the great amount of customization you have in setting up an AI skirrmish which can be as causally easy or as overhwelmingly stomp your A** hard as you'd like to attempt..lol. The level up system, including some carry over items that become permanate in your God is also very entertaining. If you can find a group to get in multiP it woud be nice and you'll enjoy it. But even alone with just AI allies it is still a very fun and interesting game. well worth the money and to have in your library.
83	This game is so bad, it's like a dragon ate a baby, and the baby's tears fell in a cup.  The dragon felt so bad for eating the baby that it cried, and its tears fell in the cup.  And then you drank it. 10/10 Would drink tears again.
84	5/10
85	A useles DOTA clone. Fails in just about every aspect, but in fairness, it does look pretty. Go for DOTA 2 or LoL, instead.
86	I don't have a whole lot to say about Demigod, since its a DotA-like and unfortunately I don't have much interest in this type of game. It seems like its pretty good. Very small selection of characters, but a large selection of skills so you have a bit more flexibility inside a game.  I personally give it a pass, but it seems like it would rate up to people who like games such as LoL or DotA2.  If you liked this review, please have a look at   my other reviews.[/u]  
87	Pretty lame unless you are really into MOBAs
88	I have a couple of dozen games that were so bad I've created a garbage category (garbage is polite) and stopped playing them in minutes. Some I can't review since I haven't even put in the required 5 minutes they were so bad.  This I played... for about half an hour. It could have been good... but just wasn't.
89	It's a moba. It's just not good.
90	this game is just another knock off mmoba, just dont even think about it. As a matter of fact, slap yourself if you even consider buying this horrific game,
91	bought in a sale package. played 10 minutes.. figured out why it was in a sale package.. it sucks.
92	not game to be a good. right?
93	Play Smite instead
94	Just play League of legends or DOTA
95	Good old game, indeed. Actually I really want the developers to continue supporting this project, that is the only con point. The Demigod 2 would be nice.
96	pro: a good league of legends kind of game that can be played single player  con:  1. AI not great. but there is a mod that can make it very tough 2. game achievements bugged, the ones that require more than one match don't register  
97	add pls collection cards
98	pretty fun id suggest getting it now while its on sale
99	The control and camera is very annoying. I prefer to have bird eye view of the game instead of almost third person view. Not recommened.
100	Good RPG Game Fight as a God or a General and cap point and kill enemy HQ
101	as soon as this game touched my â¥â¥â¥â¥ I came and started farting
102	pretty kick â¥â¥â¥ game. seriously if you like LoL, this is better.
103	this game is very fun even though at a birds eye point of veiw you play as 1 of 8-10 assasins or generals wrecking havok upon your enemies base camps
104	Quite a brilliant game once you get into it, absolute must for any and all DOTA fans. Tad short perhaps - for the fun that it is, but luckily there's always multiplayer.  Registration system sucks â¥â¥â¥ though, especially if you owned this one before it got on the steam....
105	A game all can master except for Grant Cox.
106	You like LOL? You like Dota2? This game is for you. Around 15-20 Heros playable, standing ready to follow you into death. The concept is very balanced, nothing to worry about. As far as IÂ´ve seen this game sometimes lacks of having some extra adrenaline between pausing time/ trader time. But still there is much game experience waiting for you. Definetly worth it, if youÂ´re trying to be not that mainstream as others. ;)
107	LoL and this game should trade spaces. If the servers for this game weren't BROKEN AT LAUNCH, (which slaughtered the game before it had a chance...) it would have been a hit. Best MOBA by far. No playerbase.
108	This games fun if your looking for a casual bttle arena game, or a fun alterntive to Dota or LoL but without the competition.  To bad i dosent have more Demigods and Arena's.
109	Great game, HORRIBLY made. I can't tell you how many times its crashed, doesn't work, gets closed by DEP, and a number of otrher things.
110	At least it's better than league of legends
111	Dont play in Australia, it lags like Crazy
112	Good old game, indeed. Actually I really want the developers to continue supporting this project, that is the only con point. The Demigod 2 would be nice.
113	not a bad game at its core but the ai wus so â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ that thay die 30secs after the match starts BUT there is a fix for it with a hotfix that turns the game into what he rly is but after that it can be a great time killer with buddys
114	This game is quite good it balances the units,heros (you),and amount of damage delt very well.Gameplay is amazing if you plan on playing dota 2 first practice with this.In all ways i love this game then agian the creators of supreme commander were involed in this :}
115	pretty fun id suggest getting it now while its on sale
116	add pls collection cards
117	This game is seriously awesome. Quick fix skirmish fun that's gonna keep me coming back for ages! For $6, get it! But before playing it, besure to look up a tutorial on youtube, as to help ease you into the game better. Two thumbs up!
118	Anybody who is into DOTA/League of Legends is going to pick up this game very quickly. On the positive side of the differences are going to be that there are many more maps &amp; game modes than DOTA/LoL provide. Outside of the items/equipment you can purchase in the game, you can also purchase upgrades for your structures, towers &amp; creeps. Skill trees are much more detailed &amp; allow for more possibilities than the normal 4-skill loadout that DOTA/LoL offers. Another thing that is offered is the ability to rotate your map, which is something that hasn't been offered by DOTA/LoL, yet. There are also a couple single player modes which is something that DOTA was never able to do &amp; LoL only allows in custom matches. On the negative side of the differences, playable characters are rather limited. If you'd like to try before you buy, there is a demo you can try out.
119	Great game, HORRIBLY made. I can't tell you how many times its crashed, doesn't work, gets closed by DEP, and a number of otrher things.
120	fantastic game! love playing with my family and friends! would reccomend to anyone!
121	This great game only costs 10 dollars! It is worth the money and you will spend hours on hours playing it
122	Awesome fun at a LAN party with friends. Despite it being rounded and compelling, after a while you'll definitely be jonesing for new characters and levels.
123	Takes all the fun parts of leading an army and leaves you just doing that. It's an RTS where instead of clicking build grunt over and over again, you are left free to head for the front lines where the battle is raging and fight. Capture flags to boost your forces and fight other enemy heroes head on.   It's great. Really makes for a fun Action-RTS
124	3.5 Stars. This was the first arena genre game I played. I enjoyed the style, the graphics and some of the characters in particular. The general 'capture the flag' feel of the game means you can play a number of rounds on your own or with friends in an hour.  However, the game needs polish. It lacks a tutorial or really any information on how to play the game. I also found the speed difficult initially and the suggestions online were really helpful in getting more comfortable with the game. My other issue was that I found after playing for a while that I didn't really have a strong reason to go back to it unless I wanted a quick bash.  Even so it was a worthwhile experience and I'd still recommend it despite the steep learning curve.
125	I think this is a great take on the MOBA style of gameplay. Albeit that there are quite a small number of heroes to pick from, it is a well made game that I have been playing since it was released on Impulse. If you are a fan of LoL, Dota, or HoN, I highly recommend getting this game.
126	It has been a while since I wanted to play Demigod and I'm happy to say I'm pretty satisfied, despite a few negative reviews I've read about it. In fact, I fully agree that Demigod is a really underrated game, and it's one of the few MOBAs I could relate to Dota in terms of quality.  It doesn't have the complexity of the previous one, but it is still quite entertaining even so. It requires thinking and study - although not as much as Dota -, mainly due to it's minions system. Being so, the game doesn't feel boring after a while - even though, I guess an in-game recommended item build would be very helpfull. While it is a bit hard to add inovative elements to the game genre, Demigod succeeds in having it's own traits that defines it's originality. Each hero has a unique story and they all seem to avoid the commonplace; it's quite easy to feel empathy for some characters (such as Rook - literally a moving castle). What may bother some is that the game's active community is actually pretty scarce. The AI is enough to keep the game fun and interesting; but being a MOBA, it is possible to feel the lack of other players after a while. In summary, I do recommend Demigod, it surely is worth it's cost. The game succeds in keeping you entertained, even though you have to rely mainly on playing against the AI.
127	If you played the demo and thought you liked it I reccomend this. It is a team vs. team game. It is like League or Dota, but from the 2000s. This game is older, but still very fun in a different way that I can't put my finger on. I recommend that you get this game if you have the time and money for it.
128	It was good for the 1st two hours...  then like any stardock game, bugs and crashs and bs.  no one plays it in groups... no one plays this game.  It is made by a company of con artist looking for cash because no one as taken them to court yet for fraud.  Total rubbish you get tired of fast  1/10 for the 2hours of game play tell it got old as butter in a heart attack
129	GIANT CASTLE-MAN OR BUST
130	Quite a brilliant game once you get into it, absolute must for any and all DOTA fans. Tad short perhaps - for the fun that it is, but luckily there's always multiplayer.  Registration system sucks â¥â¥â¥ though, especially if you owned this one before it got on the steam....
131	Love this game! I love playing as a giant Castle monster with achers a trebuchet and lasers all firing off my shoulders
132	I'd recommend this game to some people who have a few friends looking for some fun to be had. I play this with my dad a lot, and we usually play against three to four enemies on Nightmare mode. This game isn't meant to have an incredible storyline (sure, it's fun to see what havoc your demigod would wreak upon the world, but honestly, I don't always have time to play ten rounds of the same repeating map over and over just to see that little snipit) but it is incredibly fun to play with some friends. Yes, there aren't a lot of classes to choose from, but the fact that there are a good amount with a large skill tree for you to go down, a few varying mapas, AND the ability to change game types (conquer, fortress, etc.), it makes the game worthwhile.  If you don't have several friends (and hey, I'm not judging) who want to play a fun and tactical game with you, then I would say don't get it. But if you have at least one friend who wants to play a few rounds with or against you, then definitely, you should pick up the game and at least give it a try.
133	Demigod is a great game with a huge amount of replay value. I have played through the game with most of the characters several times on different difficulty settings and years later I still find myself coming back to it occasionally for a quick battle.
134	I played this game for a few hours. Found out that it's pretty fun, 'cause I can just play single player, testing out how different things work.  I found out, I love The Rook. He's awesome. Tried him as a physical damage dealer first, found it a little hard, then realized that he's an epic mage. Bringing up towers, that can chain with those of your team? Quite stronk. And a tower on him, working the same way? Up to 8 turrets of that kind you can summon anywhere you want? OP. Set up a base, get ambushed by the whole enemy team, and WIPE THEM THE FAHK OUT. Then you're stronk stronk stronk.  This game is a lot of fun, and you don't even need to go competative. There are tournaments, single player, probably multi as well. They're fun as well. Took one, that was two hours of gameplay. Nice way of forcing a little gameplay on yourself if you think you need more. It's ultimately a very strange game, because it seems very deserted. But fun nevertheless! I enjoyed it, a lot. For 10â¬, it's not bad, since you can play all alone, plus the loading is quick and painless.
135	Nice variation of MOBA.
136	Graphics, visual design, gameplay, maps; all very high quality and well worth the $10 price, basically minidota
137	My buddies have gotten a lot of play from this game! While it doesn't have as many heroes as most other MOBA titles (eg League of Legends, DOTA 2, Heroes of Newerth), it offers a good variety of maps.
138	Demigod can be compared with LoL, although LoL is much better Demigod does have more realistic graphics and skills to be used. Overall good time killing game ;D
139	Before the DOTA/MOBA games really took off commercially (i.e before HoN, LoL, DotA2, etc) Demigod lept onto the bandwagon and bought with it really nice graphics and fast paced action.  Unfortunately the game bombed, it came out too early in the fad when the original DotA had such a strong fan base that people passed by this game. But the thing is that it's a good game, it looks great, the classes are varied (even if there are only about 10 character choices), and it's pretty deep. Unlike other MOBA games Demigod allows you to not only spend money on your hero and his items, but upgrade your towers, nexus/castle, even minion waves.   It has a bunch of unique elements but it let down by the fact it never got the promised expanded champion roster, making this a game fun for LANs (until DotA2 released officially) but not for online play. Plus it's cheap!
140	steaksauce. grab the mods for AI updates. play vs AI... with friends. if you don't like it, then get out.  sorry stardock that i didn't buy it when it first came out... and now you will never be able to make a sequel or further updates... because you went under... because you tried to be ahead of the curve and did not include DRM when you released it... and we all took advantage and pirated it... years later, i did give you up to $4 on a steam sale though!  it may have flaws... but my fun factor-enjoyment score is: 9.6/10.  
141	LoL and this game should trade spaces. If the servers for this game weren't BROKEN AT LAUNCH, (which slaughtered the game before it had a chance...) it would have been a hit. Best MOBA by far. No playerbase.
142	its no Dota but gather a bunch of your friends and this game can easily entertaine you for a few hours other then the lame A.I and very few map and character selections, no real complaints Demigod even had features that i would not mind seeing in dota, such as base upgrades.   if this game had a little bit more work, polish, and love put into it, it could have been great
143	Couldn't get into it, and I didn't particuarly enjoy it personally. Bought it on sale and still felt kind of ripped off
144	This is the first Moba i ever played, and it will be the last. I've tried Dota 2 and LoL, but they don't compare in my eyes to the majesty of Demigod. Beautiful graphics, giant epic battles, and just pure fun. More characters would be nice, but not really necessary. If you are considering buy this, then stop thinking about it. Do it. Totally worth the money in my opinion.
145	This game is a hidden gem which I wish more people knew about.
146	Demigod is a must buy for fans of games like Dota 2. There are less heroes to choose from but the skill trees are far more involved with active and passive abilities. Each hero has around four or five skills that can be upgraded in different ways making them more powerful and adding additional effects.  The level layouts are also worth mentioning. Unlike Dota or League of Legends Demigod can be played on various different maps that have drastically different layouts. Some levels are the common square shaped arenas, others are circle shaped and include winding paths.   The graphics are also amazing. Even today they hold up and look better than most games and is still one of the best looking games on pc.
147	Demigod is one of the few MOBA's out there that allow you and your team to have an army that can be upgraded, provided if you have gold + portals that periodically summon troops. Heck the game is came out even earlier than DOTA 2 albiet slightly later than LoL i think, but they have a huge ton of more maps to play in compared to both. Sadly the list of heroes is....small (If memory serves me right, 10 or less i think) and server issues ruined it. Get it while its cheap as i doubt new heroes are getting released.
148	This game, while clunky, may have its upsides but it has some major downsides. Good: 1. Varied selection of unique champions. 2. Skill trees allow for more than 1 combo of skills which makes each time playing a champion differ from previous times. 3. Several unique maps to chose from with each one containing objectives to capture. 4. Skilled AI system that allows for the game to be tuned to fight on your level in a player vs AI match. 5. The graphics are very good for a MOBA. 6. Lots of upgrades and plenty of items to pick.  Bad: 1. The game feels very slow in pacing which can make very simple decisions fatal. (like accidently stepping into an AoE and taking 5 seconds to get out of it) 2. The towers aren't a big deal when you have at least 1 minion around thanks to them usually targeting minions, so tower diving is easy when it shoudn't be. 3. Even with movement accelerating gear; getting to lane is an adventure. It takes about 30sec just to travel from the base to your 'lane' even with a good bit of movement speed gear. 4. Some character animation take a while to pull off (Such as regulas gaining his wings) and will end up practically making you stun yourself for a few seconds. 5. Towers can be hit from out of their range with certain champions.  Ugly: 1. The ballence between champions is missing. Almost completely. Take for example Regulas. This champion is supposed to have the best range in the game, yet His snipe ability does a measly 500 at max rank while another champion can (with high range) throw a knife to deal over 900 damage. Regulas' ability require a windup where this knife slinger champion does not. 2. The champion 'rook' can practically stage a 1 man wrecking machine event where he is able to practically run down towers with almost no damage taken thanks to an ability that restores a large sum of hp (800-2000) while dealing the same amount as damage to the targeted tower. This, with his 700-1700 dmg hammer, will almost 2 shot building aside from the citadel. 3. Rook also has a very troll ability. He can damage a building while healing himself. This can be used on ANY building in the map including the Citadel. So he can literally end his own team if he so desired. 4. Being that this game is so uncommon in the multiplayer servers, nobody will be on to play with for about 99.99% of the time. This pretty much means if you want to play with anything besides an AI, you need to buy another copy for a friend, or just have them buy it. 
149	Really cool game if you enjoy either strategy or moba games like HoN, Dota, League etc. It offers interesting heroes as well as a deep leveling system and a multitude of strategies. it even allows you to level you troops aswell making it a bit similar to many of the moba gems on Warcraft 3  the online matchmaking is a bit barren but get a few friends together and this is a blast!
150	I really love this game. Sadly the player base for it has fallen out a bit but that was largely due to the terrible online that stardock provided with it's release. Now that the online has been corrected this is one of the best MMOB's that I've played.
151	A damn good MOBA, that it practially doesn't fit the genre. Better and much more balanced than any of those other games in the genre. The only real hurdle you have to jump over, is memorizing all the items available to you in game, as you certainly don't have time to be perusing through the whole selection while the battle is being fought.  10 / 12  Made by the creators of Dungeon Siege and Supreme Commander. High quality games from great devs!
152	Really fun co-op.
153	This game is a lot of fun, but the trailer is a little misleading about what kind of game it is. JOIN ME!!
154	Fantastic game, hugely underrated.
155	A nifty old Dota style game that is nifty fun and a blast to master.
156	Demigod is one of the first dedicated MOBAs to come out. Way before the LoL or DoTA hype. From Stardock, the company that gave us Sins of a Solar Empire (yeah, I'm confused too) comes an excellent game with one major flaw: Lack of content.   Demigod has only a handful of maps and even though they look gorgeous (bear in mind this is an old game so be lenient) there's just too few of them. The same happens with the Heroes. The characters are all detailed and have different playstyle and abilities but there's so few of them that you'll grow tired pretty quick  Without a single player campaign or some kind of story mode, there's really no reason to buy this game over some of the newer (and even free in some cases) MOBA other than curiosity. You won't find many people to play with (community is almost dead for what I've seen) but it could function as a good time sink for you and your friends when you are bored.  I'll recommend Demigod, but bear in mind you can probably get something much better for free.
157	Honestly a terribly underdeveloped League of Legends or DOTA 2. The combat mechanic is terrible, no chance of escape unless you are by a tower, even then, you still will probably die if you are outgunned. Literally just go download DOTA 2 because this game is bad.
158	I have been playing this game for years and years and really love it. I bought a four pack, let several of my friends buy four packs. I find the Sardock activation troublesome from time to time. After a fresh install I just want to click and go, especially if I go to a LAN party.  I can recommend the game. It's cool, fun and atmospheric. It's also possible to download mods and to mod the game yourself.
159	Played this since original release. Download mods to really enjoy it!
160	An excellent MOBA. In my opinion superior to LOL and DOTA(2). Sadly there are not many playing multiplayer, possibly because it is not completely free.  A shame, as it is more fun than most games in the genre.
161	This is game would be great for a LAN party but not really a good single player game.
162	good game but hate stardock
163	It's a pretty fun game, if they kept updating it then it would have been amazing to have more units to play.
164	For those seeing negative reviews, I for one do not like MOBA games very much if at all. But, for once I like a game that genre I normally stay away from most of the bugs have been fixed and the game worked day one aswell. Hope the devs come back to this game, cause it would be nice to see all the other charactors. 3.5/5
165	IÂ´d give this game a 6 out of 10, but only because I played it on release back then.  I 'recommend' this game only to 'senior gamers' and if you get it at a SERIOUS discount.  This game is like an old 'DOTA /LOL'. But noone plays it anymore. I bought this 4pack for me and my friends for about 5â¬ and we had a few rounds of fun with it because it reminded us of the old times when we played it shortly after release.  The game still has its charme. The graphics scales nicely and the 'heroes' are different enough. Its not as fast as lol/dota, so its fine for me.  Newer players - stay away from it, theres better out there. Old players - bring your friends.
166	Very fun game, character models look great and it plays well. Not perfect but fun for a few hours :)
167	Not a bad little game but only a few maps and it really only shines when you play with friends. Hit it when it's on sale and get a few copies and share with your pals for the best results.
168	tl;dr Do I recommend this game? Hell no. It's the worst the MOBA world has to offer, which is impressive as it doesn't even have a player base and that's usually the biggest problems of MOBAs. This one is shoddily designed from the ground up. It can be fun for your occasional casual romp with friends, but don't expect any deep or balanced gameplay. This game is ALL over the place.  Probably the worst MOBA-style game I have ever played in my entire life. But I'll get into details, so bear with me here.  Demigod looks absolutely amazing. The graphics are, even to this day, absolutely stunning. The levels, Demigods and even the creeps are amazingly designed with great detail. Sounds are crisp and distinct and you can easily tell what is what and what just happened. So presentation is top notch.  AI is completely brain dead and there's basically a coin toss if you'll win a game against hard AI with hard AI on your team, because your team will do some absolutely â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ crap like trying to push while one of your portals is captured. Yeah. Ok then.   Item balance is all over the place. Literally. Some items (Unbreakable Boots, Groffing Warplate etc) are absolute must-haves no matter what demigod you are playing, others are utterly useless yet priced like they're premium items. Mkay then.  There's no ability scaling at all, meaning that caster demigods have very sharp power steps throughout the game, and a caster hitting a power step before you can spell utter doom for you if you're on the other side. In-hand Demigods are all over the place. Characters like Unclean Beast are WOEFULLY imabalanced, and a fed UB can singlehandedly win the game against a full team of three demigods without even breaking a sweat, while Demon Assassin is a character I'm scratching my head as to why he's even in the game. Even with his insane burst, he can barely kill anything at all, and once his burst is used he's a free kill.   There's some utterly stupid items in this game. Who thought that a relatively cheap consumable that gives you +50% HP was a good idea? EVERYONE uses them, ALL the time, which means that you basically have to kill people twice over, as they suddenly gain a second healthbar mid-battle. Usually they've already started running away then, and just as you're about to finish them off BOOM! They're back to almost full health due to that utterly stupid INSTANT USE item. Why is it instant use? I...I don't even.  The Citadel upgrades are a neat addition and is legitimately something I would like to see in other games as well. Because those actually change the dynamics of the game a lot, and while some upgrades are headscratchers (death penalty reduction? WHAT?) most upgrades do have a place on some maps and some are must-haves on every map.  There's a good variety of maps. From smaller 2v2 maps to humongous 5v5 maps. Good variety and they look awesome, all of them!  Controls are...well. I dunno how to describe it. They only work half the time. You can right click to make your demigod move to a specific spot, only to have him suddenly stop. Unless you are actively paying attention at that very moment, your demigod will stand there getting murdered, while you think he's running for his life. And no, I don't mean when you're hit by stuns, as that does give you a big hint in that all your abilities are redded out while you're stunned.   Defstacking is OP. It seems like the best way to win this game is to just stack armor and health. There are no percentage-damage based items to counter big stacks of health, nor are there any penetration items to punish extreme armorstackers. So stack armor and health and just never die unless you do something utterly stupid.  Artifacts. I don't even wanna talk about these. Hilariously expensive. Why are these even here? 18k for an item seems like they're NEVER going to get use. I've seen a mage slayer (8k) now and then, but usually only in really long games. And IF someone gets a hand on one of these, the game is over. Plain and simple. Unless that player is mario or demon assassin. Then you can just laugh. If he's unclean beast though, you're done. But you probably lost long before he even got any artifacts.  Online is deader than dead. No one plays this game anymore, so if you want to play with anything but brain dead AI-teammates you need to get some friends. Then you'll probably end up hating eachother as this game is an utter mess.
169	funny, relaxing but pretty unbalanced. still really for for an hour or two from time to time.
170	This game mastered Tug of War
171	The game itself is fun - very fun.  In fact I might say that in terms of gameplay demigod is my favorite RTS game in the style of mobas.   However - the single player is very meh. AI never does anything different and putting 2 ai's together is guaranteed to result in a infinite stalemate.  And that's really it for this review.   The multiplayer is all but dead - filled with nothing but elitists and impossible for newbies to get a game going. I played this about a year ago, so I can only imagine it is only more dead now.   I tried very hard to get a game going - went to the official forums and made a newbie thread and asked for anyone to play with me. Though some said yes, I never heard from them again and they didn't respond when I contacted them.   So I went into the online play in-game and joined one of the three games they had going - all were elitist games that didn't want newbies - I tried anyway because I was sick of single player. Told them up-front that I was new. I was kicked and told to go to another game that was in the lobby - so I did. Then they kicked me and told me to go to the one I was just kicked from.   Finally I met someone willing to play with me. The most horrible thing happened: The game crashed in the last 3 minutes of the game. It was already a done game - he was attacking my primary base. Somehow the game awarded me the win though - told me that the other guy lost connection. I guess there is some glitch that people can take advantage of and do this - because as soon as I contacted him he called me a cheater and refused to talk to me and swore he was done trying to help 'fake' newbies.   I love the lore and the gameplay but since single player mode is bad, and multiplayer is practically unplayable I cannot recommend this game at all.

200	Having a really good time playing this game! It's just the senseless silly fun that we all need in a game sometimes! See what I mean here         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  #Worth?! Ep.42 - Zombie Playground (Gameplay / Review)&nbsp;
201	The game is fun, the only problem is that im laggin with 60-90 fps. in addition to the camera being jittery makes it hard to play.
202	it's a nice game fun to play, even alone.  
203	I've rarely seen a game that embraces the bad guy as thoroughly and wholeheartedly as Lucius does. There's no hesitation, no complex explanations, no hedging of moral bets, or offering a suggestion that the game's victims kind of had it coming. In the game's opening minutes, the player is asked to lock a maid inside a walk-in freezer overnight, for no other reason than because the devil tells them to do it.Lucius is a singularly bleak and nasty experience, its only 'redeeming' characteristic being the utter straightforwardness with which it treats its darker subject matter. Not only does the game refuse to shy away from depicting the horrifically violent, it lavishes attention on the atrocities, showing them in slow motion from dramatic camera angles.A third-person adventure game based loosely on the film The Omen, Lucius lets players control the titular character. This nefarious six-year-old spawn of Satan murders everyone foolish enough to come onto the grounds of the family estate.The game is broken up into nearly 20 chapters, each one themed around Lucius killing someone in his house without drawing attention to himself. To accomplish these violent ends Lucius has access to a variety of powers, including telekinesis, mind control, and spontaneous combustion. The game manages to find a wide variety of clever and gruesomely creative ways to employ these powers, but it's important to note that all the cleverness is on the part of the developersâthere is no experimentation allowed, and each kill must be performed in a specific pre-scripted fashion.At times, this can make the game feel like it's on rails as the player moves mechanically from one kill to the next with only the barest context offered by cut-scenes. While the brutal murdering goes smoothly enoughâin fact, most of the levels can be zipped through in just a couple of minutes if the player knows what to doâthere are other aspects of the game that are downright rough.Two key stealth sections are far more difficult than they ought to be because the game never clearly expresses what its rules of stealth are.Even worse are the game's ill-conceived boss fights. There aren't many, but at certain points in the game Lucius is exposed, and has to kill a foe not through guile and trap-laying, but by throwing fireballs at them. The controls are a little wonky to start with, and in these sequences they completely fall apart.While the question of whether it's a good idea to put players in the role of a dead-eyed mute psychopath is open for debate, it's undeniable that Lucius's developers have captured the feel of their inspiration perfectly. There are missteps that keep the game from truly excelling, and the story is serviceable at best, but Lucius provides a unique horror gameplay experience.
204	Remember that horror flick titled The Omen? I know it was released in the '70s but it had some sequels (and a remake in the 2000s) and it was a unique film so you probably remember it.  Lucius, in essence, is the video game version of Omen. You take control of a 6-year old boy who, wait-for-it, is the son of The Devil. Now, the goal here is to eliminate people one by one in the household where Lucius lives. This is quite the manor as daddy is some famous politician who is preparing for the upcoming elections. So, the house is full of maids and other servants - offed one by one without anybody having a clue.  And that is the point here. We cause accidents. Pick up items, combine these items and get rid of the evidences or make sure those point to another person. I like how the breadwinner of the family and his wife slowly go mad as they have no idea how these people died or for what reason. Between the almost 20 chapters we get to see many cutscenes with some decent voice acting. A detective gets involved and decides to really find out what goes on with the family.  Anyway, I do not want to spoil it. The game has very nice graphics and memorable music. I like how the effects change to indicate a different time of the day or different season. This is good as it brings us change and running around in the same house does not get boring. Different rooms / areas of the house get into focus in each chapter and it is not uncommon that the season itself has a role.  Later on the game starts granting us abilities such as telekinesis or mind control. To be honest setting people on fire was a bit too much - after all this is an adventure game. I think they should have just stuck with the stealth / adventure approach but for some reason they added this spell to spice up the gameplay a bit. In fact, the ending sees two ways of solving the game: there is an action as well as a puzzle-oriented solution.  The game has some flaws, though. For instance, in some cases I really could not find out as to what I needed to do. Lucius does hint at the next task (you have a journal which regularly gets updated with his notes) but they are not always very helpful. Oh well, just grab some guides then and complete the game like in the old days with the point-and-click adventures, am I right?  I am a bit perplexed to see many negative reviews stating this game is mediocre at best. I think this is a nice little game and a must-have for the adventure game fans or those who like the idea of playing an homage to Omen. 
205	Quite possibly the most evil game ever created.  Bravo for another Indie developer.   This game is something else even though it's a familiar genre. As you play you may recall such movies as The Omen, The Shining, The Exorcist and Final Destination, among others. Also, if you like Hitman and Death to Spies series, then this game is definitely for you.   Anyways, I believe that Shiver Games is onto something here. This could easily be made into a movie. You play as the son of devil who wants you to harvest souls for him by killing people, or by rather making it look like freak, deus ex kind of accidents. You live in a huge manor along with a congressman (your fake father), his family and about a dozen of staff.   You play through 18 chapters (even though four separate chapters are molded into two missions, so it's essentially 16 chapters).The game may take you at least 6 hours to beat if you don't use any help online (which I quite often did).   This game requires your utmost attention, there are no abstract objectives as to what you are supposed to be doing. You have to read between the lines. You have to use your Ouija board and your notebook to try to figure out who is the next target. It may take you a long time to figure out which tool to use and on whom. After the sixth mission or so, you get access to the rest of the manor and you can pick up items that you are going to need for the rest of the game, making the job easier later on.   You also get to do around 7 menial chores to increase your behavior level in order to get three presents from your parents. As far as the killings go, well some of them are absolutely atrocious and were it not for the somewhat mediocre engine, they could look even more gruesome. The ambiance is awesome, the soundtrack is outstanding, the voice over decent enough (by male actors mostly, I found female voice acting weak).   One thing that bugs me is that Lucius doesn't speak, although they admit to that in the game itself.......There are also numerous crosses spread throughout the house that are nailed to the walls. These crosses take away your abilities of which there are 4 (telekinesis, pyro-control, mind control and forgetfulness spell). So you have to turn them upside down to be able to do your black magic tricks.   The story and the pacing of the game are amazingly well put together, the 'freak accidents' get more and more, well, freaky, and the detective investigating the murders narrates the entire story with a small preamble before each mission. Your parents also start getting suspicious to the point of them being scared of you, so every murder has an effect in the game. This kind of story telling sucks you in to say the least.   The last buggy mission coupled with some graphical glitches like (people warping ahead or you getting stuck in doors) was slightly annoying but it wasn't anything game breaking. In the end, I feel that this game needed slightly more polish. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- This is definitely an adult game, made by a confident studio. If the religious Right had GTA in their cross-hairs for all these years, then I would not be surprised if this game got the same treatment. That would be awesome so the game could get more publicity resulting in more sales. So please don't forget to support this new and bold Indie Developer, this IS a PC-exclusive after all.
206	A perfect gift for all your christian friends
207	Lucius is loosely based off of the 1976 movie âThe omen.â The game revolves around a 6 year old boy, who kills members of his household to please his father; Satan.     As far as the story goes, Lucius, the devil's son, murders members of his household, making them look like accidents. The Devil approaches you once in awhile, to congratulate you, as well as provide useful abilities or to demand better sacrifices. Over time, the means to kill your target, become harder and more arbitrary. After killing most of the live-ins, you will progress to start killing family members, leading up to the final chapter.     The gameplay revolves around checking notes, listening to people, doing chores on occasion, and finding a way to kill your target. The player will always be in the same house, and never leave it, becoming boring over time. The house, overall, has a creepy feel to it, fitting properly into the story, however becoming dull rather quickly. The player will spend time in three main areas of the house, with a lot of unexplored areas.     The art style, although aged at the time of this review, is still present; dark, creepy and mysterious. The sound and music in Lucius come across perfectly, trying to add to the creepy atmosphere. The Voice Acting is well done, by most of the cast. Some characters are more convincing than others but no character really stands out as a âBad sounding characterâ.    The game can be confusing at times, with the ingame hints being extremely arbitrary. The game isn't overly linear, making the game a tad harder to progress, and may be frustrating. With hundreds of hints and walkthroughs online, makes completing the game very easy, however if you are the type of gamer that refuses to look things up online it may take a long while before you complete all the chapters. I Myself only looked online when it came to the final âBoss fightâ.    Lucius did a lot of things right:     The sound and voices in game is solid   The cutscenes are gruesome and fantastic   The achievements are rather easy, if you plan ahead   Lucius is an enjoyable character   Lucifer is the best sounding, and most interesting character   The kills are satisfying      Lucius does a few things wrong     Massive map with spread out objectives   Can be very glitchy   Can be boring if lost or confused   May be frustrating to some players    can be to easy or to hard depending on skill level     Overall, lucius is a good game, it has its bugs and problems but can be very enjoyable. I killed almost 10 hours alone just playing the story, and i still got over 70% of the achievements by accident. Is it worth the $10.99CAD pricetag? That depends on if you enjoy either hunting achievements or are a fan of the genre. Although different from âThe Omenâ it's still very similar and fans of the movie will most likely enjoy it. Pick it up on sale sometime and give it a play.

209	Really wanted to like this game. Thought the setup was great.   Pros  - Decent story - Interesting concept  Cons  - Bugs that cause you to restart whole chapters - Memory wipe power was worthless - Sometimes obscure pieces to the puzzle - Very linear - Chore concept could have been better - lose suspicion allowing more flexibility for being a 'good boy' - House design is a little poor - takes some time to figure out where everything is - Would have preferred using powers to make others do terrible things on their own instead of just killing them outright - Some controls like Telekinesis and the tricycle are clunky. Same with final encounter mechanics  Kept waiting for the game to shine and it just never did. Can't recommend.
210	good game, although the 'deaths' are scrpited, could be better if you chose the way you killed your victims.
211	As a fan of The Omen movies, I immediately bought this game desipite the so-so reviews.   Yes, as a quality game it fails in some ways. The graphics are pretty bad and I thought I was looking at a Halflife 2-era game because it looked like something off the Source engine.   There also isn't a lot of freedom to trap setting because once you find the solution that's it. It's basically an adventure game.   Now that the bad is out of the way, the concept is so awesome and the deaths are so unbelievably cruel and gruesome that it's a memorable experience. I would wait until it goes on sale, however.   
212	Game name: Lucius Game score: 8/10 Reviewed by: Wolf   In Summary...
213	A great idea, executed in a not-so-great way. That is Lucius, a horror-focused action adventure.  So, the idea is great; a free roam game where you get to kill people like in those famous horror movies we've all seen. You'll be using items and powers to kill off these people. It's not all that straightforward though. You have to solve little puzzles to complete objectives. And every time you complete one of these objectives you're one step closer to killing a certain someone.  But it's all executed in a mediocre way; the inventory is cumbersome to use, but manageable. The 'stealth' missions are terrible; there's no way to see where a certain character is so you'll bump into someone frequently. And sometimes the hints you get just aren't clear enough, which results in you doing the wrong thing. And when it's Game Over you have to start the mission all over again (including sidequests).  It's an interesting idea though. And I would love to see a(n improved) sequel someday.  [Rating: 65/100]
214	10/10
215	Its like a Hitman Game but as a little kid with supernatural powers :D  Took me around 5.5 hours to beat the story  HOW MUCH BETTER COULD IT GET :D  10/10 Would recommend getting it on Sale
216	This is one seriously twisted game. The graphics are good looking and smooth but the gameplay is limited despite the undeniable pleasure of randomly killing just about everyone you come across in a variety of inventive ways. It will never be a classic but it's certainly worth a look if you can pick it up cheap. 60%
217	Finally a game where i can be the bad guy. Its rare to see a game like this. The voice acting is a little weird at times while the faces have little to no expression to them. You get to be a little demonic fuker going around killing everyone. Achievements are easy enough aslong as you try. Some of these deaths are really brutal, which i love. 10/10 Everyone should try this game.
218	I don't have 9 hours on this, I left it idling while going to get pizza. I bought this for 2 dollars. I did, however, beat this game in 4 hours.  If anyone were to find this game enjoyable, it would be myself. I am a huge fan of the hitman franchise, puzzle games, and being an edgy powerful spawn of satan that can manipulate people and burn â¥â¥â¥â¥ with his/her mind. I expected this to be an open ended puzzle game with many solutions to every mission (offering replayability) that slowly worked up to a Carrie-esque climax when your power reaches an apex.  This was not the case.   Reasons:  1. Every mission can only be solved one way. Past the 7th mission, [almost] every mission is solved by simply manipulating people to kill themselves. Most missions are either too easy or pseudo-difficult by not allowing you to use your satan given powers for unexplained reasons. Some missions are so unbelievably easy that it can take quite a few minutes to figure out because you need to take a moment and stop thinking creatively.  2. At your most powerful, a priest with a looped cliche voiceline 'The power of christ compels you' can 'game over' you in the matter of seconds. Same goes for a man with a fire extinguisher. Aparently, satan's child can be killed by a swift whack to the face with a fire extinguisher. Oh and god forbid satan's son got surrounded by fire because OF COURSE you can't walk through it. Same goes for locked doors.  3. The game does not play smoothly. In order to open a door, you must have the 'hand' ability equiped instead of any of the other powers given to you. Every action just enables another animation/cutscene. This makes you feel separated from the character entirely and everything feel like a chore. Might as well actually get off the computer and pace a large â¥â¥â¥ mansion looking for some super glue... the graphics in real life are better.  4. There was absolutely no attention to detail. The developers were obviously very lazy as they did not fix/add simple things. Uncomfortable pauses in voice acting, clipping, glitching, dull gore, the list goes on. One of the most lazy moments: When people see you using a power, you are spotted and it's a game over which makes sense but at one point, a person who is trying to kill you knows that you are a spawn of satan and you can still get a game over by them seeing you use a power in order to defend yourself. I suppose the developers simply forgot to remove this feature at this part in the game. This is probably because it is near the end and none of them could actually bring themselves to play this far.  5. The story is    The Omen    how original!  6. The side quests are so dull the developers didn't expect anyone to actually do all of them. Well guess what â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s, I did. I did all of your boring side missions. I did them because they unlocked items in game! However, this is only true for the first three or four chores. After this, the developers couldn't come up with any more easter eggs/items to use. Imagine doing a tedious side quest in an RPG only to be prompted with 'No more awards available' after you ran Dr.â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥head's Bread all the way to Fort Shimbles!  7. Even the achievments are lazy.  8. Finally, the developers were lazy which completely makes the game unenjoyable.  The moral of the story, don't give these lazy â¥â¥â¥ devs even two dollars of your money because they may possibly devote their profits toward ruining another good game idea!
219	Child of the Devil...
220	Lucius is a third-person adventure/puzzle game, in which you play as Lucifer's son and murder everyone in the manor you live in. The concept is interesting, since it's kinda like reverse horror, but unfortunately the execution is poor.   The gameplay is pretty much just murdering the people in the house in a certain order and in a pre-determined way and watching a cutscene showing the murder. After the murder cutscene you get a new cutscene, which usually involves a detective, who is put on the case after your first murder. The game could have easily been a point-and-click game, because you just look for items and after using the right items you watch the murder commence.  The game let's you free roam around the fairly big manor between the murders, but there isn't much to do aside from some 'fetch quests' called chores and looking for items needed in future murders. After doing enough chores you get some items, of which 2 just give hints for the murder puzzles and the last one is a tricycle. The tricycle let's you move around the manor a bit faster and also let's you use a glitched staircase to get out of the house.   After each murder you get a new superpower or upgrades to the ones you already have. The game has 4 superpowers: telekinesis, mind control, memory erase and combustion. You will need all those superpowers for the murder puzzles and while you can use some of them for other purposes, they're not really fun. The combustion power is also used in the boss battles the game has and also in some extra mini-game, which seemed to involve priests chasing you (a child) with crosses in a dark forest. I didn't like the boss battles or that mini-game at all, because the combustion power isn't fun and felt a bit clunky to use.  Graphics-wise the game looks pretty good for an indie game, but the devs decided to occasionally use some post-processing effects, which actually made the game look a bit uglier. The lip-syncing seemed to be a bit off, but it didn't really bother me. The voice acting ranged from pretty good to quite awful. The game also has a pretty badly done sex, which looks quite funny as a result and there's some frontal 3D nudity as well.   The story and dialogue is pretty bad and the ending was probably one of the worst endings ever.  It's a pretty bad game, which could have been so much more. I wouldn't really recommend playing it unless you want to experience some pretty funny glitches. The game is pretty short (took me 5 and a half hours to complete), so it's not like you'd waste a lot of time.
221	So I acutally bought this game last year, perhaps around October (2015) time, and I haven't played it until now.  This game is one that I would recommend for numerous reasons.   Upon initially loading up the game and killing my first person, I was completely hooked. I'm not too sure what that says about me, but who cares. I think perhaps it was the fact that I've never played a game where I am basically the spawn of Satan. Also, post purchase of the game, I was surprised that the game had an actual, well-written (arguable) storyline. It was nice to have to follow a pattern of scripted killings, instead of just walking round murdering at will (not the mechanic xD). I especially enjoyed the fact that every death was different and unpredictable. This was very pleasing.  Another reason why I enjoyed this game was because each character was different and had a different purpose. There was one particular character I had a problem 'ending'...and that was Alastair. I thougt he was cool, and he reminded me of Alfred Pennyworth, who's a pretty awesome Batman character.   However, having said that I would recommend this game THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT COULD IMPROVE.  First of all, I began to feel that the constant murdering towards the end (even though I did enjoy the story and each character's death scene) was getting a little teadous. It just felt like it was going on-and-on, chapter-after-chapter. Although it was still fun. Second of all, I had a real big problem with some of the achievements. As of writing this, I have all but three achievements left to collect:     Playing for 20 hours.     Playing for 40 hours.     Riding on the bike things for 10 miles.    At the moment, the 10 mile one isn't a problem because I know I'm just going to have to ride around, however, the other two are completely ridiculous.  First of all, I don't see how there is 40 hours of content here, and after looking at the global achievement statistics, only 2.9% (or something like that) of people have got this achievement. This is a game that I will come back to and replay in the future but, there is no way that I am getting a 40 hour achievement that is worthwhile to get. So I will be missing these achievements out. Having to do this really annoys me, because I am (and sorry for the colloquialism here) an 'achievement â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥'. I really like achievement hunting.   Anyway, I hope this was helpful. I've never really given a proper review before on here, but I felt like I should for this game.  Thanks for reading and please be respectful of my opinions, as I would be to yours.  Thanks again.  
222	Come to the dark side, we have cookies  about Lucius Its a good boy..................until he reach age of 6  pros +graphic s pretty good for that genre of game, it give the feel of evil +the story is pretty simple you need to kill people and they souls go to your Daddy aka Satan +however I said story is simple bu didnt said its easy, all murders need to happen by accident, first few are easy but later not so much +you know how they need to die you just need perfect timing and way to make it happen +later in game you get a challenge +its a big house where murders happen so lot of explore and side quest  +patience is key of sucess +game is challenging   cons -memory wipe power sometime doesnt matter when you get caught from behind you need turn around erase memory and run away, this can be good feel but after few times getting caught it really not good, btw when u get caught and not fast enough to erase you need restart chapter -.-, however it teach you to be more careful   Playing this game I can recommend this game 100% it give you challenge, and of course SATAN
223	Lucius has so many problems. So many glitches and bugs that make to solving puzzles impossible. And you can try so many times before you understand that its a bug. Graphics are acceptable but not smooth and i had fps problems with my i7 4720, gtx 860, 16 gb ram system (but this is not acceptable). And it wont scare you cause you are the guy who is scary. The best thing about Lucius is a idea of playing Lucifer's son (Omen? of course:) ) Totally it needs more things apart from a good idea. I dont recommend it.
224	Absoloutely love this game, It has hours of fun, lots of puzzles, and a very creative story. I would definetly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a dark game filled with satan and lucifer. This has many missions and a great character list. In the first mission alone you get to trap a maid into a freezing meat locker and freeze her to death, and that's only a tutorial on how to play!! I love this game and I would love to play it more, I'd give this a 7.5/10
225	This game is so amazing that I couldn't put it down until I finished it. I finished in a single playthrough that took 6 hours, where I also got 54 achievements along the way.   You play as the devil's child and you have to kill all persons in your father's mansion without leaving any traces, while a detective investigates every death as they happen.  The game is a bit of adventure, point and click, stealth and puzzles in general.  A special note to a chapter where you have to take the power down, then everyone in the house is walking around with a flashlight and you have to avoid them at all costs while doing some tasks - a really fun stealth experience.  LUCIUS IS REALLY BADASS.
226	9/10  +interesting quest +sex, violence and cruelty +interesting ways to kill them +cool and interesting story +play for evil -low quality -terrible bug
227	Lucius is a reversed horror-based detective story, where it's you who has to apparently outwit the detective and not the other way round (as is usually the case).  As the son of Lucifer, it's your task to rid the entire household of Mr Wagner, a US senator while being discreet as possible. In order to achieve this you're given some powers that will aid you along the way that include memory wipe and mind control.  It's fun while it lasts but because it's within a mansion and you have no control over how to go about killing these people (it's written in stone), it quickly becomes boring.  6/10.  My Youtube review:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UoIM6UsOio 
228	Would love to, but i just can't recommend this game. I like the idea, love the genre... but Lucius simply doesn't meet my expectations. Hope they do better next time tho.  Cons: - No plot at all (you are basically a paranormal serial killer) - No logic involved in many puzzles. - Huge mansion, small essential objects to collect not easy to spot quite often. - No AI. Just bots walking up un down predefined paths + some triggers. - Extremely linear game:  * Puzzles have 1 and only 1 solution, if you miss a tiny object in the corner of a room you are simply stuck till you spot it.   Overall: - Dull, repetitive, frustrating paranormal serial killer simulator. 'Avoid this game as hell, the power of the Christ compels you!'
229	This game was a birthday gift from a great Steam friend, always wanted the game and always wanted to try it but I was always unsure about the game if it would be good.  Well im glad I got to play this game because it is truly an amazing game yes it's from 2012 but the story is pretty cool, It does revolve around one house and one family but the developers have made this work in a good way, you play the game as a child coached by the devil into doing some pretty evil things.  The gameplay was great and I will play this game again to get the last achievements, the graphics are great and it worked well on my 5760x1080 resolution which I really liked.  controls are pretty basic but for this game and it is ok  To me the Steam write-up does not help sell this game and the metacritic score I don't really understand people's low ratings I guess we all see games from different prospective.  I will finish this off by saying if your thinking about buying the game buy it you wont regret it if your into horror.
230	Gore 10/10 Story 8/10  Gameplay 6/10 Replayable 8/10 Achievement 100% 7/10  Lucius is like the film Omen, but let's not talk about the film 'cause I can only remember bits. 'Bought this game when it was on sale and I would buy the game if it wasn't. The Story and Gameplay kept me playing alone.  If you enjoy playing a dark twisted 6 year old demon child, that go around killing residents of the Mansion you call home in the sometimes sick and gorey ways a demon child can kill you.   Story isn't majorly long about 6 hours, well thats how long it took me. On each of the chapters of the game you kill someone but you have to go on a hunt to find certain items or objects to set them up to look like a accident and not a young speachless boy.  And for more creepy is unlocking the bicycle and go riding around from room to room like its a scene out of a Stanley Kubrick horror movie.
231	   Non-flexibility at killing gets annoying after a while
232	Lucius is a game where it puts you in control of a 6 year old boy whos grandfather has a deal with Satan. Where he and his family well gain everything they could want, in return his first Grandson, Lucius. Satan comes to claim what is his on your 6th birthday, where he proceeds to instruct you on your new fait. You must kill every one living with in the house hold (maid, cooks, mechanic, family members, and your teacher) with out being caught by the investigator that is trying to piece the hole mystery together.   The killing is a little linear when it comes to who and how you kill them but it still makes it interesting trying to figure out how to do it. The story is good and the graphics are not to great but over all its still one of my fav games. If it goes on sale for $10 its a must grab if you enjoy Horror Adventure games from the killers point of view! 8/10
233	Ahhhhh, what can I say!!? The cutest little devil ever!!!!! :')
234	Lucius reminds me and I'm sure of a lot of people of The Omen. The gameplay is simple yet the manor is a big place to explore and the chores for side missions were fun to do for gifts and rewards that help you around.   The voice acting is pretty bad and the graphics are fair but despite this, it's the idea of controlling a six year old to kill that gives me, and people that actually understand this game, a very deep guilty pleasure.
235	There are too many 6's involved! The baby was born in June, the 6th month, on the 6th day, in 1966. That's four 6's! Now if the baby was born on 6-06-06 and the game was set back in the day just a bit further than what it is now (60 years lol), it would be freakier.  It's nice to play the bad person for once in a video game, that is what makes Lucius refreshing. The music is creepy enough to set the tone of the game and the controls are easy to use. There is no reset to default in the keybinds, so be sure you want to rebind keys before procceding. Some of the quests can be quite confusing. 'What do I do?' is the most used question I have asked myself throughout this game. You are not really given hints on what to do or where to go until you do them and your notebook is updated. Thanks notebook, where were you before I did this or that?! Satans notebook bites.  Man, I am one evil, little 6 year old murderous brat, it's great. Another creepy thing is, when writing this review my text was spazzing out all over the place. This game is haunted! One of the best game I have got for free through Indiegala.
236	The Omen Simulator. 10/10 would peep bathing maid again.
237	Meh.  As others have stated it's not a 'kill people in clever ways you choose in a sandbox'. It's a 'figure out how to kill people in ONE clever way that it pre-determind.'  It's narrative driven and probably not bad (gfx and controls are good) but not what I hoped. Should have researched before I bought.
238	In this adventure game you are Lucius, a son of the devil. Daddy likes souls so he asks Lucius to go kill people for him. He rewards Lucius with special powers that make him an even better killer.   Lucius shouldn't get caught, of course, so he makes murders look like an accident or frames someone for them. This means that each murder is a mini puzzle for which Lucius uses items he collects throughout the mansion and his special powers to 'solve the puzzle' and kill the target without getting caught.  Meanwhile, the story in the game is about the adults in the house: a bit of background for each target, how they react to the murders, the police detective investigating the deaths, etc.  For me, the puzzles were neither too hard nor too easy, so I found the difficulty perfect. At the start of each chapter, you are pointed to your target either via your note book or via the in-game map. Sometimes you may feel a bit stuck because you don't know what is expected, but when you look at the clues (you can get a cryptic clue from Daddy in your room, but you should especially look at the items you collected and at your notebook) the solution always comes to you because it makes sense.   Lucius' special powers like telekinesis and mind control are explained very well by Mr. Lucifer and they make the puzzle solving a lot more fun than your average 'point and click' adventure slash puzzle game.   The options in the game menu are: - adjust resolution, adjust graphics details (low, medium, high or ultra high), toggle full screen, toggle Vsync and adjust gamma - adjust sounds and music volume  - toggle 'invert mouse' and adjust mouse speed - re-bind keyboard keys or controller buttons  You should expect to get about 5 hours gameplay. About 7 hours if you don't rush and hunt most of the Steam Achievements. On that note, I should add that two achievements are absurd i.e. 'play the game for 20 hours' and 'play the game for 40 hours'. This means running the game as your active window, so running it in the background doesn't count. This is such an obvious and cheap way for the devs to try to get higher numbers of playtime for their game in Steam. Moreover, these two achievements appear to be bugged for me because the counter for both is still at zero.  All in all, I had fun playing this game and would recommend it but only when it's on sale at -50% or better.
239	good game reminds me of my childhood
240	Good concept for a game, although it is a bit short I completed the whole thing in just over 4 hours. However I have to continue to play or leave the game running for 40 hours for the final two acheivements. Whilst it is a decent game I can't see myself playing it for that length of time. I re did quite a few chapters when I was acheivement hunting so I think I'm done with it now.   The house can be quite difficult to navigate and the game feels a little clunky and buggy at points (It crashed twice and my new PC hasn't crashed with any game). Would have been nicer if you had a little more freedom in the game, as it is you have to stick rigidly to the storyline. But I did enjoy the story and some of the kills were just pure twisted and evil.   I got this in the Steam sale and am happy with it for the price I paid, but I don't see myself paying full price for it. 6/10
241	Very dark plot in this game, it is like that horror movie Omen. Game is bit too dark for me so I won't finish it. It plays okey and graphics are good. The mood is perfect anxiety if you like being villain in game then this is for you!
242	Unfortunately Lucius is buggy with a poor checkpoint system and has game breaking levels that are just unacceptable. The vague tutorials will have you looking for walkthroughs quickly and hampered by bugs in the game. Sometimes leaving you with the game over screen when it shouldnât be. Lucius is a clever idea and can be funny at times, but overall misses the mark.
243	An amazing puzzle game. Although it is quite twisted, I wouldnt class it under a horror genre.  The good:  - Generally speaking, it's a really fun game. - Good amount of play time, it took me 6 hours of playing to finish it. - The puzzles can be quite challenging and take some time (can be good for some, may be bad). - Involves some elements of stealth (can't get caught holding something or doing something bad, as well as not being caught running around at night). - Includes 'side quests' (you get chores to do and get rewards) - General gameplay is quite nice (other than a few bugs) - Key mapping is great and easy to use  The bad:  - A few bugs/glitches. I had to restart a few levels due to getting stuck. - Storyline lacks depth, although this does not affect the gameplay at all. - Ending (the puzzle ending) confused me a bit. Maybe it was meant to be left open ended, but I don't think this was done well at all..  Definately recommended. 
244	If you think you can run this game above 40 fps, you are very wrong. My old pc runs this game at around 5 to 20 fps. My new pc runs this game at around 15 to 40 fps. and I have saw so many posts about people cannot run this game with good fps. So yeah , I decided to uninstall this game. Poorly optimized , even high-end PCs cannot play it smoothly.  Current PC Specifications :  DELL Inspiron 7559  Windows 10 Home ( 64-bit )  Intel Core i7-6700HQ CPU @ 2.60 GHz ( 4 Core ) 16 GB RAM  NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960M 4GB   Old PC ( 2011 - 2016 ) Specifications :  ASUS Laptop N53J  Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit SP1  Intel Core i5 M480 @ 2.67 GHz  4GB RAM  NVIDIA GeForce 425M CUDA 2GB
245	I wish I could write iffy reviews. Because this is a game that will infuriate you with it's bugs and lack of a save feature but then make you laugh at all the stupid voice acting and goofy death scenes.  A lot of the times the missions will be vague and you *will* need a guide.  Sometimes your interface will disappear on you and not come back until you restart the whole game, and you can't save.  There's no first person camera so get used to the back of Lucius' head blocking everything.  But if you can look past all that, the game is still very amusing and atmospheric.
246	A fairly mediocre adventure game with an even worse story. Got bored really quickly of the mechanics of the game and the story never really interested me. It is a surprisingly violent game but I personally think it doesnt really add much to the experience.  It also has two really poorly designed achievements that require you to play a total of 20 hours and 40 hours of the game. Why is this poor design? Considering the game can easily be beaten in 7-9 hours the high time requirement just doesnt make much sense. Sure, the 20 hour one could be conisdered a 'beat the game twice' kind of achievement but as the game really lacks reasons to play it more then once not even that one feels justified. The 40 hour achievement just feel like they want people to keep the game running longer as free advertising.   Time to 100%:  40 hours
247	Well, this game is pretty awesome.. I mean killing people, worship Satan and stuff. But, there are also some annoying things such as broken controls, sometimes I couldn't pick up an item and had to reload. And one more thing which made me hate this game for a moment.. it's the mother of Lucius. I hate this stupid â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, she used to follow me every step while I was playing. So sad I had no chance to kill her in a first hour of playing :\
248	What can I say,I feel so satisfied when i can kill my bi#@y mother,my ugly Granfather and finally my dumb father :D
249	Not super polished, but still pretty good game where you control Lucius, and kill other people. And make them look like accidents. Game is somewhat limited, you kill everyone the way game wants you to. You can roam in the map pretty free, and it has some stealth elements to it. Little bit clunky, but after a while you get used to it.   If you can get through the rough edges of this game, it can be really fun. Or at least entertaining, as I don't think killing everyone one in your family should be considered fun.  Pick it up on a sale, or in a bundle
250	gifted this to my friend with christian parents  he got grounded
251	A brilliant concept, but inescapably dull gameplay. You have to spend too much time wandering around looking for objects, or specific interactions, and because the game's kills are so linear, there is no way around this.   A great idea, well built atmosphere and theme, but it just isnt really worth the time. Also, my xbox360 controler did not work for this game despite 'full controler support'.   6/10
252	great adventure and little bit horor game but very short storyline but while you are achvement hunter you must played this game 40 hours for all achvements
253	Quite an entertaining game. Would certainly recommend if found in a bundle or on sale.  Puzzles and gameplay are fairly simplistic, but the entertainment for me came from the darkness of it. You are running around as an evil child...
254	If you run out of matches.. Go buy new ones...
255	BEST TRICYCLE SIMULATOR EVER
256	An interesting concept, though poorly done. Doesn't worth to be picked up, unless on a very big sale.  Lucius has a very good story, decent graphics and amazing voice acting, though the bugs, glitches and the limited gameplay ruins the chances for an entertaining experience.  Being the son of Lucifer, he does have quite a few paranormal abilities, still, making his tricycle drive for a few seconds after he gets off it and eventualy crush half of it into the floor - is definetly not one of them. Same with Lucius walking through closed doors and getting into places where he is not supposed to be. Noticed this once in the middle of the game, and once again at the very end, when you're supposed to kill your father in the burning house, somehow i walked through the front door (which was locked) and could't manage to get back inside after trying for a half hour, ultimately being forced to restart the game. Yet, this is all pice of cake. The most annoying glitch in this game are the hints. It's not enough that they are kind of unclear, but sometimes they appear after you already completed the task, leaving you in the most complicated missions without no clue what to do. As for example there is a mission where you must kill one of your maids and the only hint is 'she is doing laundry'. After i spent about 2 hours trying everything that came into my mind, i finally gave up and decided to watch a walkthrough where i found out that i'm supposed to use telekinesis to pick up an iron from a top shelf and drop it into the washing machine, then start it. By doing this you'll brake the washing machine and leave the maid without an occupation, then she'll decide to take a bath giving you the opportunity to kill her. How the hell was i supposed to know this ? And guess what ? After i broke the washing machine i got the hint that i should do so...  What i hated the most was the limited gameplay. The history was already written for you. You can run around in a huge house, interact with the people you find, but you can't choose which one to kill, or at least how to kill him. Each crime is to be commited in order, and by the specific methods, even the special powers that you have can be used just on specific missions, specific people or objects...  I would recommend to skip this one, unless you get the occasion to pick it up on a very big sale (at least 80%) just for the heck of it.
257	Inferior OMEN game adaptation! Sacrifice people and get a tricycle!  (one-timer interactive movie, easy to get 100% achievements)
258	A game where you get to play as the antichrist, I found Lucius to be alot of fun. If you're a fan of the older Hitman games (Where planning of a hit was paramount) then you will find this game rewarding. Its also a breath of fresh air since you get to be truly evil for once.   A small indie dev so don't go in expecting AAA production values.
259	7/10 
260	Saw from Poods , if you like satanic stuffs and screwing around this game is just for you. Funny/dark playthrough so just buy and raise some hell !
261	Lucius is a gem of its own kind.  The story, very original, compliments and works perfectly with the very original and unique gameplay. Even though the basic concept remains the same throughout the game, it never fails to feel new and more innovative each time, by asking you to really sit and think about how to proceed in your tasks. It's also very challenging ! You may get stuck on a few of the murders as they will really push you to be creative in your process of thoughts.  It just was fun. Very fun.  Now of course it's not perfect : there are a few minor bugs scattered around, and the gory/satanic side of the game may give people some trouble, but then again that's what to expect with such a game.
262	Lucius is an evil game with a great atmosphere and an amazing soundtrack. The gameplay however is at times just moderate and a bit clumsy bot most of the time it's interesting to figure out how the next murder should be done. The gameplay, the characters, the graphics, the soundtrack and finally the setting - all go arms in arms and create a wonderful charme of spine-chilling scariness. Overal this game is simply brilliant and I'm not aware of any other game with such a deep haunting atmosphere.  Not recommended for weak nerves, otherwise try it out.
263	Completely brilliant, if somewhat linear.  Once you get the hang of figuring out creative ways to kill people, and how to navigate the map, it becomes less tedious.  Who needs clean underwear if you've already got your toys?
264	Great game, great story, not boring .
265	This was one of the best games that I have played. I wanted it for a while and I got it during February because it was on sale for $5. This was well worth the money! You play as a boy named Lucius who becomes interested in his true calling, killing people. So you kill everyone in your household and after each kill you wake up in your bedroom in the night and Lucifer teaches you a new skill. You get skills like Telekenesis, Mind Control, Memory Erase, and more. Overall great game! Buy it! 8.4/10
266	This looked like it could of been a good game but you are not given any info in the game on what your suppose to do.  This is the reason I do not Recommend this game Also its not worth $20 if you want to try it wait until its on Sale again here on Steam.  The Controls on this game are also worthless.  So Unless you get this free or for $1 like I did I don't recommend it 
267	Murdered the gardener by making him ram his head into the lawn mower and escaped on my getaway Tricycle. 10/10  In all honesty though this game can be kind of a pain to figure out. Don't go in with the mindset that you will absolutely NOT use a guide- because you will probably never beat it without one. Some of the kills are straight absurd on how you do it. Otherwise fun game, I still recommend!
268	Lucius was born on the June 6th, 1966 and he was just a regular boy until his 6th birthday, when his true identity was revealed by his true father, Lucifer who instructed Lucius to orcastrate the deaths of the mansion's residents without anyone suspecting him, granting Lucius supernatural powers as he succeeds. The concept is interesting, the graphics and soundtrack are quite good, the gameplay is great and the story is intriguing. Despite all the controversy surrounding this game for obvious reasons, I still recommend it.
269	this is the first game that gave me experience to be a   bad-satanish-boy   character.  at first I was really excited to be in this huge mansion but after like few hours Im getting bored cuz actually this mansion is not that 'huge'.  plus with lack of creativity in killing people cuz there is specific weapon for specific people in specific mission.  So, thanks to the walkthrough guide :D  well it is worth to try.      my playtime is including my little sister's playtime and also the one for getting the achievement    
270	So awful that it's actually kinda good.   Hilariously over-the-top gore, unexpected nudity, laughable writing and voice acting, wonky physics, bugs galore - it's like the Goat Simulator of horror games.  The game's main problem is that it is so linear, limited and obtuse that it's pretty much essential to play with a guide so that you can follow the precise series of steps required to complete a chapter. Wandering around the mansion with no clue what to do next gets old very fast.  
271	The criticisms are unfounded.  I didn't buy this for a while because many reviews spoke of mainly 2 reasons that made the game frustrating: 1) A lack of autosave means you have to do the WHOLE level again if you get caught. 2) It isn't clear what you have to do, and you spend forever wandering around trying to find or use the right item.  What they don't mention is 1) a level lasts 2 minutes when you figure what to do and, bar 1-and-a-third levels, you can move freely around your mansion. 2) You're given many clues, but there's always Google for when you derp. I HATE doing the same thing over again, even just backtracking, but this never happened.  Another common complaint is the linearity, but the way you have to kill them is often the logical choice. You're supposed to cover up your kills, so the game just letting you shoot everyone would bore as well as defeat the point. (Lucius 2 would go on to prove this point according to all those reviews.)  It falls down at the final part/ending, it's a bit awkward, but overall it's a fun, quick game. While some things aren't amazing (voice acting, cutscene animation, music use), it should be noted that this unique game came from an independent developer from Finland, so I give them leeway, and it's not bad anyway. Best of all, they actually care about their players. I'm reviewing their final, polished version. When there were noises that the finale was disappointing, they made a thread on Steam and asked for feedback and if people would like an alternate finale, then added one (it's a bit better).  Be that creepy mute kid who follows people around on his tricycle down hallways. It's a right laugh.
272	Great in concept, absolutely indescribably terrible in execution.
273	EDIT REVIEW:  Ok.. well there is now an auto save and a save after every chapter. So yeah... this game is excellent. After about 10 minutes, you get used to the controls and then the story captivates you. Played this game at one time. The game makes you think as you try to solve the puzzles to murder all the people in your house. What more could you want?  Oh and the ending... I won't spoil it... but it's great to see this type of ending.!!      ORIGINAL REVIEW: As much as I want to like and play this game, I don't. The story is good, but the controls are a little tricky to get used too. The worst part..? There is no option to save. So you will get so far and have to go for whatever reason, but your game hasn't saved so you can only start from the start again... No thanks. Fix this and I will play it again.
274	+Voice work  +Story  +Music  -Can't skip cutscenes  -Game becomes bugged if you pick up an item before you should.   -Resume game option only after intro level  -Can't skip HUD intro.
275	I love this game, it's so evil! If u like horror movies u will like it. The story is based off of The Omen.
276	It's entertaining, short, adventure, puzzle quest game with many gruesome deaths, little bit of nudity and few plot twists.   Game is straight forward - there is only one way to kill each person and you must find all items to do it. Even with all quest items, it may take some time to understand what and where is required to do, but luckily there are guides for that.  Don't expect open world here - mansion and garden is all you can explore.  Graphics even on Ultra High left me unsatisfied. You may encounter some bugs, restarting chapter will fix that.  There are 2 endings. First is easy, 2nd takes some time to do it right, but will reward you with more satisfying ending, a la horror movies.   Don't expect too much, this is no AAA title, but good for indie developers. Buy it on sale and you won't regret it.  P.S. Don't let your kids play this.
277	Have you ever wanted to corrupt the innocent and be a generally evil demonic little child? Well then this is the game for you.  If you just stick with it through the glitches and try to overlook the many shortcomings this title has then you WILL have a good time. Itâs a real diamond in the rough.  On the surface it may look like a third person action game, but itâs actually a third person puzzle gameâ¦ one with a good premise too.  Price wise though wait for a sale, full price it is a little much, unless you LOVE the idea of being the Antichrist then have at it.  Trust me, go ahead and play the son of the devil. Its fun ^_^ 
278	:::: Bringing the Devil Out :::::  What to expect from this game?  It is a game wrapped around the life of a boy who is not ordinary. In fact he is driven from the human number of the Beast, '666', and it is your goal to carry on some devilish fun. The game has very detailed graphical visuals that surround the setting of a Mansion where the boy does his evil deeds. If you are into some puzzle solving killing fun, this may be the game to enjoy those fantasies and desires.   What are the positive things about this game?  While playing this game, you will immerse yourself into a house full of family, staff and house guests who will live throughout their last days while you prey upon them. There are plenty of rooms to expllore and things to move or take for your goal needs. Once you play for an hour or so, you will feel like part of the family. There will be different missions/goals to achieve during the day or night, while others are awake or asleep. Rain, snow or sunshine will not keep you from killing. Just, do not get caught.   What is the negative things about this game?  This game is linear oriented to the variety of ways to kill your target. There is only one solution for each goal, which can be very fustrating. (For example: You can easily squash a bug, spray it with poison, or catch and release it. In this game, you can only spray the bug with poison.) This game would be better if their were alternative ways of reaching your goals. Also while playing this game I have encounter some game glitches, bugs and crashes. The game have crashed while loading the next part of the game. I also encounter a glitch while traveling down or upstairs, the NPC characters would either push your character off the stairs or get you stuck between them.  Would you recommend this game?  Yes, solely becuase of the orginality of this game's design. Although this is a very linear game, I find it ammusing to try to leave clues about you being the killer throughout the game. (Such as leaving toys or other objects to appear in the cutscenes when not needed. I had many laughs with it) **There is no playback value to this game, except to have fun and cause mischieve.   BE A VERY BAD BOY !!!!!
279	Lucius is a game that you want to play only one time. It's a simple and lineal game in which you play a rol as a rich child with supernatural skills solving simple puzzles and killing people without leaving a single footprint. It also have 'Stealth missions' that you will hate because it's SO BUGGED that sometimes, some people can see you backwards or through walls. A couple of mission's hints are not quite clear enough to the player, so maybe sometimes you'll need to roam around the mansion trying to see what you need to do.  Pros:  + Great Idea of the game + Barely funny + Free movement + Open world (Mansion in this case) + Nice skills  Cons:  - A lot a bugs (Example: the stairs and the tricycle are not very compatible) - Bad face factions - Sequence repetitions (Those guys in the garage with the same music and the same conversation everytime) - Exaggerated ragdoll functions (See what happens when you shoot someone with the gun) - 6 Hour duration average - 2 unneccessary achievements: play 20 hours and 40 hours - You cannot do anything but the quests - When you finish the game, the only thing you can do is just start it over again - WTF final  My score is 6/10

281	Quite a nIce game. It's about the everyday life of a 7-y.o. boy, with stuff like household chores, finding different stuff for people and ridind your small tricycle in the hallways. I recommend buying it, it's pretty relaxing and a lot of fun.
282	Lucius is a psychological horror stealth game developed by Shiver Games and published by Lace Mamba Global for Microsoft Windows. It is centered on a six-year-old boy, who is the son of Satan. Players take control of Lucius as he murders members of his household, using powers of telekinesis and mind control to orchestrate deadly accidents that lead to the deaths of multiple residents of Dante Manor. Players use their wits and follow hints to ensure they do not leave any evidence that would lead to a mission failing.
283	Bought it yesterday for $20, on sale today for $2. Worth it.

285	i noticed some problems with optimisation. with my GTX 850M and 2047 MB of memory, i had max 25 frames. anyway, despite technical problems, the game is absolutely awesome, great reference to the famous film Omen.  9/10 because of the fps, sorry.
286	Kill your family. Impress your unholy father. ????? Profit!  Other thoughts: I'm impressed that this game still gets occasional updates.
287	A little short but interesting and enjoyable game.
288	A personal guilty pleasure. Fans of tacky horror movies will find enjoyment in Lucius.  The mansion where the game takes place is very interesting and is a excellent environment to explore.   The graphics fail to impress and the controls feel very clumsy. Chapters also feel very short and fails to give players the chance to be creative as the way you kill people has already been pre-determined by the game.   Overall the game is enjoyable but could have used a bit more polishing.
289	That game can make the time you spend playing it fun and pretty interesting. The game has a fine graphic and cool gameplay, the soundtrack is good. This was a unique experience playing that game and I liked it a lot.
290	The next time you go to church and the preacher tells you that video games are evil, you can look him in the eye and tell him.......er....uh......Well, since this game's release, there's really no good counter argument. LOL Yep, in this game you play as the son of the devil. It is heavily influnced by the 1976 classic 'Omen,' and that honestly is the only thing that initially attracted me to this game. It's a third person mystery/adventure game where you explore a huge mansion and find creative ways to kill off the help. You do not play a hero. If this game has any heros at all, it's the detective and your clueless parents. The chapters of the game are divided into each person you kill, and with each murder, your satanic powers are increased. You get such skills as mind control, combustion, and memory erase. You can move things with your mind and set people on fire, but you can't be seen because you don't want to draw suspicion. The story is progressed through very good cutscenes told between chapters and the game has a lot of atmosphere. The story reaches it's climax during a very cool exorcism scene, but man I've never played a game where I wanted the character I play as to loose so bad. It's a very interesting twist that honestly, I wasn't totally comfortable with. But it was original, unique, and very interesting, with great controls and a neat open world mansion to explore. So if you don't mind taking the role of a devil child and knocking off helpless people for Satan, this might be your cup of tea. BWAHAHAHAHAHAAA!!
291	Very fun to play with people
292	6 year old kid killing his whole family for the glory of Satan. And you are that kid armed with demonic power. Each murder has to look like accident so they wont throw your â¥â¥â¥ in asylum, or yet worse, catholic church. The concept actually sounds better than actual gameplay looks like, but it is worth trying.
293	Lucius is one of those games where so much could have been done, but nothing was. It is very linear, you cannot decide who you want to kill and when, but the game tells you who, and exactly how to do it. It introduces new skills when they are to be used. The characters have no character, except for the father and the detective. Either the mansion is too big, or there is too little in it. I did enjoy the story-telling element of the detectives puzzlement.  I got Lucius on sale for 90% off, and that is a more fair price at which I would recommend it.
294	I've always dreamed at things that Lucius does. â¥â¥â¥â¥ing wonderful game. Best song for this game:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWNzZygAjJY 
295	Satan taught me how to use a flashlight.  10/10
296	This is a suprisingly nice game. Wasn't expecting nearly as much from it.  Basically you're a devilish child doing devilish things, cursing your manor and driving the family insane.   Pros:
297	Pretty neat little game, more fun if you go for 100% achievs.  (paid $3.50 for both Lucius 1 &amp; 2 very happy, felt like a steal)
298	This game is different from what I usually play. It does feel a bit glitchy using the telekenisis ability, especially if you haven;t played for a while, but that might be just me.   It's fun for the morbid part of all of us.

300	It's a fun game though sometimes the house can get pretty confusing. Worth the 5 dollars for sure.
301	666 out of 10
302	This game is great. Maybe not as polished as bigger titles, but a very good play.
303	Installed. Been playing for 16 minutes. Game freezes. GGWP Lucius.
304	This game was a joke to me. I don't know why it just seemed â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. You go around killing people as a little boy that never freakin talks man.
305	If you ever dreamed of being the son of evil, this is your chance. Lucius is a game with strong links to 'The Omen'. The player takes the role of Lucius, the son of the devil, who has to clear the mansion of itâs residents. To do this he must orcastrate âaccidentsâ without anyone suspecting him of any foul play.  Sounds great but sadly, the game is bogged down by its poor execution, buggy levels, and monotonous mission objectives.   Sound 9/10 Graphics 7/10 Gameplay 7/10 Atmosphere 8/10  If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:  http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides   http://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation 
306	There is something missing from this game. I love the idea of wandering around a house, finding items to use against hapless victims but the whole experience was a little stale.  Became very boring very quickly
307	At least as bad as some of the worst games I've played, Lucius is a cheaply-made game at not such a cheap price ($19.99, at least $25 over what it's worth, meaning the developers should pay you to play the game).  Everything from its looks, to its cutscene and gameplay style might make you think this is from another era (and not a good game from that era), yet it's a 2012 game, only one year old at the time of writing.  The game is incredibly frustrating, with no pointer as to what to do, yet it wants you to perform in a way that is 100% how the developers intend you to play a mission.  In fact, there is a hint as to what to do, the mission title, but even if you get it, which if you're like me you will usually, you don't get how to do it because the game just won't let you use your powers in a meaningful way unless you're at the right place, at the right time, under the right circumstances.  Lucius is a very poorly designed game.
308	Unfortunately this game is linear and uncreative. A promising game held back with poor execution including bad voice acting, lame writing and boring gameplay. In order to solve the way to kill someone it'll take you a matter of minutes because there are only a few areas to even access. No multiple ways to kill someone either. Got it for $2 and I feel like I over payed.
309	Excellent game! I loved the plot a lot! Buy it, it's worth it!
310	I just completed 'Lucius', and thought that there'd be no better time to write a review for it. In this game, you play the title character, a young boy called Lucius who happens to be the son of the devil. This is quite a departure from most other horror titles, and the effect it creates means that 'Lucius' isn't really a horror game at all, as you're implicit in the planning of all the atrocities committed throughout the story. The fact that it probably won't scare you doesn't mean that you will find it unenjoyable, though. 'Lucius' takes the form of a puzzle game, and a few action sequences are spread throughout the title; bear in mind, though, that the action isn't sufficiently frequent to appeal to someone who dislike puzzles and strategy. If you choose not to rely on walkthroughs (which, I admit, I did on a handful of occasions), you'll be spending a considerable amount of time riffling through drawers, shelves, rooms and cellars, looking for the various objects necessary for the completion of your mission. Your mission, invariably, is to eliminate the multitude of inhabitants and employees of Dante Manor. As you have the physical capabilities of a normal eight-year-old boy, you won't be relying on machetes, sledgehammers or firearms for your kills; instead, you have to use your environment. This complements the puzzle-based nature of the game, as, on occasion, the main challenge of your mission seems to be knowing just which weapon you should use. If you've seen 'The Omen', you've undoubtedly already drawn a handful of parallels between this game and the film. Whilst the acting talents of performers like Gregory Peck and Mia Farrow are sadly unreplicated in this uncannily similar game, you'll surely find enough interaction - whether object- or person-based - to immerse yourself in the world of Lucius and Dante Manor.
311	Finally a game that lets me BE an evil child instead of running away/fighting an evil child. There's nothing more relaxing after a hard day than murdering people. For the glory of Satan, of course!
312	Excellent game! I loved the plot a lot! Buy it, it's worth it!

314	At first i was not impressed with this, then slowly it began to grow on me. I bought this game in promise of a sandbox type serial killer game but this is not the case. Instead the game tasks you to kill specific Help around the house and it is your job to move things around and set up the perfect kill. As far as the sandbox experience goes, you can move seemingly random objects around the house and place them anywhere.  The game places you in the shoes of a seemingly innocent six-year old boy as he is celebrating his sixth birthday. Just so happens that this boy is not your average kid, he happens to be a literal spawn of Satan. Or Lucifer obviously implied by the developers naming the kid 'Lucius'. Lucifer wants souls and it is your job to give it to him. One day every month you are tasked to kill employees and family members who reside within the house. Every kill challenges you with intricate puzzles, easy or not depending on your skill level (I finished the game in seven hours). The story is not ground breaking, just your typical murder mystery manor. But it is pretty amusing to watch the mental health of your family members deteriate as they try to figure out who is commiting the murders. Towards the end, you are given the choice of what type of ending you want. Action or puzzle, given for players who like puzzles or action, or both.  Overall this game is really good and i would definitely recommend this game for my friends.
315	I would recommend this game. I like the concept of the game and the story. I think this isn't the kind of game you play for the incredible graphics and the game also has some bugs. But overall it was good fun, I liked the tricycle!
316	Bought this game on the Steam Summer sale and made a good choice. This game was fun. The story was pretty good too. Overall 9/10.
317	After completing the game I decide to write a review within minutes of completing the game no spoilers are included: The game is about killing everyone in your house without getting caught and using unique ways of killing. The game has decent graphic despite only a few characters having proper walking animations and everyone else just wobbles. There are some glitches like being cornered and then pushed off the map, but glitches are bound to happen with old game. I do have to say without help from a few guides on some missions that lacked explanation or I have not notice. 
318	pros -  satan is pretty handsome.  Spooky demonic powers  Harvasting souls for daddy. Smashing peoples faces in with pianos.   Cons:  Buggy as hell.
319	Very original game, worth the price and very fun in a sick kind of way!  Could improve with better instructions and tutorial and faster loading!  Overall very cool game! :)

321	I got this game when It was on sale for 99 cents, And It was worth it. It's very neat and interesting, Sure, It may be full of bugs. But I can guarantee that you'll always find your way around them. I would definitely recommend this game.
322	This game filled with pure evil that I can't manage to handle. Please only try the game if you could consume it... otherwise you end up having a weird nightmare and gonna experience heavy stress-out.  Just sayin'.
323	Frame drops and crashes almost all the time, I do not recommend unless you'd like a game full of lags and unpatched bugs.
324	Picked up maids panties, learned how to use a flashlight, killed a maid in a freezer. 10/10 would be antichrist again.
325	You can get bored after like 4-5 hour of playing, but It's a good game.
326	Fun game, you have to love killing people in a dark style or something. Worth my 94 cents xD  Leuk spel, je moet wel van mensen doden in een rare stijl houden ofzo. Het is mijn â¬0.94 zeker waard xD
327	This game makes you think you can get away with murder... NOTE: YOU (probably) CAN'T GET AWAY WITH MURDER  Pros: fun puzzles to solve, murder, b00bs (yes, it has b00bs), descent play time, gory, not terrible graphics, good story  Cons: Not enough people to murder ;)
328	Awesome.....hahahah this games teach you how to kill people
329	As Lucius, you're tasked with systematically slaughtering a mansion full of family and staff without getting caught. That also means you cannot attack your target directly by conventional standards. Because of this limitation, Lucifer himself had endowed you with various abilities and powers to assist in your work. Naturally, the more souls sent to your father, the stronger your powers become. These powers involve telekinesis, mind control, mind erase and combustion. You'll mostly be using telekinesis throughout the game, while others are used in specific areas or chapters. The only ability I thought had any growth was telekinesis. From lifting cups for a few seconds to starting cars and killing power to the entire mansion was the only time you felt like you were getting stronger.   When it came to the murders, I was a little let down. I had expected more freedom when planning each kill. Something closer to the Hitman games than what we got. You're presented a scenario in each chapter and you have to figure out what is expected of you to meet the criteria and proceed forward. Each scenario is interesting and satisfying in their own ways and involve homicide, suicide and accidents. Yeah, it's some pretty gruesome stuff, too. One example is using water on snow to ice over and having a character slip on it, then using telekinesis on an icicle to finish the job. Almost all of the murders involve an extreme element of puzzle solving instead of force to accomplish your goal. If you're into that style of game, it's pretty damn fun. I wasn't complaining too much after I got the hang of things.  OH yeah, you have to appear as a good boy to the house hold, too. You're actually given chores like cleaning your room and brushing your teeth to complete. Upon completion, you're given good behavior points and will receive gifts that may make your work easier. And it's kinda fun. A little. Maybe. What? It works and so does this game even if it's not the game I had expected. It's pretty damn close. And I cant think of another game that's really like this. It's far from perfect and can be very frustrating, but it's a neat experience and an interesting perspective to take on. It's a slow horror game about plotting your attack, without any threat of being attacked or having to hide in a closet. It's a liberating horror game in that sense, having so much power with nobody suspecting a damn thing.  After my first playthrough with Lucius, I was reminded of games like Destroy All Humans, Stubbs the Zombie and, well â¥â¥â¥â¥, Grand Theft Auto. I wasn't reminded because of gameplay similarities, but of the theme of playing as the villain or âbad guy.â You see, there once was a time when the ability to play as the villain was kind of a hot topic among various circles within the previous decade. Ultimately, the conversation didn't go anywhere and most people seemed fine with this idea. The most controversial moment was in a Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 segment that allowed you to play as a terrorist and shoot up an airport full of American civilians. That segment was so upsetting to some, it gained attention from national news networks. If that was something that got under your skin, playing as a seven year old spawn of Satan tasked with killing a bunch of people in horrific ways might have the same effect.
330	Pretty short and a little bit buggy. But very fun to play.
331	-SPOILER ALERT-  My Parent's Maid had an ice cold personality, so I put her in the Freezer!   10/10 would freeze again.  I feel my behaviour was a bit cold now that i think about it though...
332	It's a brilliant game but the police are awful. I froze someone in the freezer room and the police's final diagnosis is... cardiac arrest.
333	Great game. very fun
334	Fun. Demonic. Satanic. Lot's of killings (Nothing else lol) Ever wanted to be a 6 year old walking around a big mansion killing people with magic powers given by your father, The Devil? Well i have not, but the game is fun sooo, try it out.
335	Great story. It is fun to be evil. During the game you have to figure out how to kill all your targets. You also getting a few special powers. You can also use your tricycle in your house and break a few pots (and no ruppies inside, I am not link)  In the last level I do have a irritating bug/Crash, this make it very hard to finish that level.
336	Lucius 47, Codename: Devil  Unique, funny game where you slaughter everyone in the mansion while being possessed by Devil himself. Bought this for under 1 euro, was a blast to play through. Can't wait to jump into the 2nd one.
337	I got this game on sale a little while ago, and I had such a great time playing it. The game follows a strict storyline but allows you free reign of the house to explore. It does glitch at times, which can be frustrating, especially towards the end, but I would say that the gameplay itself makes up for that. The dark plot and graphic murders are definitely an enticing storyline, although I would say (without giving too much away) that the story seemed very rushed towards the end. But overall, a brilliant game, very enjoyable to play, would definitely recommend.
338	its a fun game but its creepy to the point that its scary
339	Frame drops and crashes almost all the time, I do not recommend unless you'd like a game full of lags and unpatched bugs.
340	You can have a tricicle and kill everyone, TEN OUT OF TEN
341	I got this game when It was on sale for 99 cents, And It was worth it. It's very neat and interesting, Sure, It may be full of bugs. But I can guarantee that you'll always find your way around them. I would definitely recommend this game.
342	.. forgive me father, for I have sinned..     and for those who's seeking to be enlightened about the game:  you will have no idea what you have to do, because you lack of clues. But don't worry tho, you will be guided. ;)
343	I rather enjoyed this game. Playing a precocious child by the name of Damien Dante, you have to kill people. Why? For the glory of Satan of course. This game is pretty much just The Omen: The Videogame. You have to figure out how to kill people without getting caught. The only problem is there is just one person per level that you kill, and there is only one way to kill that person. So it does not play like a sandbox murder simulator, it plays like an adventure game. That means it is boring. Even rudimentary skills at rpgs or adventure games will make this one far too easy. But still, it was fun. With the exception of the 20 hr and 40 hr acheivements, that is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t when I can, without cheating, complete the game in 6 hrs. The style of game also makes it not replayable. Buy it if you can get it on sale for super cheap.
344	Nice 10/10 would read the holy bible again
345	This goes to one of the 'Game you have to play before you die' on my list.  The gameplay is similar like Hitman.  But you are not bald.. And you are son of the Devil :)
346	Killing all the people in your house because you're the devil's son. Who'd have thought this would be such an amazing game to play. And no, I'm not playing the game just because the kid's name is close to mine.. I blame Pewds for getting me interested in the game, it's probably one of the most gruesome games I've played before, but I love it. (I'm not violent, I swear.)
347	It's a load of crap
348	It's a brilliant game but the police are awful. I froze someone in the freezer room and the police's final diagnosis is... cardiac arrest.
349	Fun. Demonic. Satanic. Lot's of killings (Nothing else lol) Ever wanted to be a 6 year old walking around a big mansion killing people with magic powers given by your father, The Devil? Well i have not, but the game is fun sooo, try it out.
350	Awesome.....hahahah this games teach you how to kill people
351	666  I enjoyed this game!  + story + cinematics + devil/hell things + you feel like a badass! + two ends   - sometimes glitches - kinda hard puzzles (I used walkthrough)
352	After completing the game I decide to write a review within minutes of completing the game no spoilers are included: The game is about killing everyone in your house without getting caught and using unique ways of killing.

I do have to say without help from a few guides on some missions that lacked explanation or I have not notice. 
353	Lucius is a unique game. It is a brilliant puzzle game, figuring out how to use your powers and things around you to kill various people, even having a story that even though not fully compelling is made bareable by the great gameplay. The mansion is a joy to explore and its had top standard gore. If you like challenging puzzle games with a dash of blood, this is the one for you.
354	This Game Is Very Good !!! Interactive !!!!
355	pros -  satan is pretty handsome.  Spooky demonic powers  Harvasting souls for daddy. Smashing peoples faces in with pianos.   Cons:  Buggy as hell.
356	Lucius is a devilish game that follows a little boy hellbent on murdering everyone in his house to please his father; Lucifer. The game is broken into chapters, and in each chapter you must kill an assigned target. There is no time limit to this, which gives you plenty of time to explore the game and interact with your fantastic surroundings, and talk to the characters which have unique dialogue that change as the story progresses.  The game has some very difficult parts that take quite a bit of thinking, and a couple of easier parts. Sadly, each death is scripted and you have no choice in the way they die, which means if you replay the game, you don't get a different experience. Having said this, it is a wonderful little game, with some very interesting cutscenes. The premise is a little cliche, but the execution is fantastic, as it keeps you interested until the very end.
357	*spooky scary skeletons play in the background*
358	being the son of satan is awesome  
359	Im almost 12 Now. Killed over a couple of Guys. Still no idea how to tidy my room.  
360	a bunch of wax dummies get murdered by damiatian from the omen, listen to black metal and meditate while playing this and your chakra will allow you to communicate with satan as you contemplate the abyss of the inferno society clings to. I stopped playing when your mom tells you to clean your room, hit too close to home.
361	100% Satan is my Dad now. I'm so proud.
362	An Amazing game with a brillant written storyline. Brought it yesterday i was unable to put it down. Managed to complete it within 5 hours
363	Interesting idea, pretty bad graphics, entertaining, but not creative gameplay. Strong 8/10, worth buying for that 1$ :)!
364	Very challenging, with a lot of exploration needed to solve the murder puzzles.
365	Lucius is a awesome game but can be hard at times. You need to find out what to do and eventually you'll get caught doing it or moving too it. Really frustrating at times but that's all part of the game. :) I loved the game, the killing parts are the best. xD
366	Satan's blood marches through my veins, like giant RADIOACTIVE RUBBER PANTS! The pants command me. Do not ignore my veins!  AND STOP TELLING ME TO PICK UP UNDERWEARS!! GIVE ME MY â¥â¥â¥â¥ TRIcycle that i had to ride in circles for an hour to get ONE achievement.  How i hate this game *hugs*~
367	Very challenging, with a lot of exploration needed to solve the murder puzzles.
368	This Indie-game is the perfect combination of 'The Omen' horror-film and gameplay from 'Hitman' franchise.
369	Pros. Nice graphic unique gameplay Need to think first before act Unique story  Cons. The stealth thingy feels stupid bug.lot of em even in the last fight you must restart the game more that 3 times.  Be aware that this game are full of satanic thing and gore if you can't stand or get triggered by that kind of thing then don't buy it,But if you like those thing i reccomend you to buy it because it can turn on your inner psychopath feeling  Overall 8/10
370	Its so amazing and funny. Ways of murders are so good :D
371	Murder your whole family.....
372	I really enjoyed this amazing game. 8/10.  + interesting storyline + not too easy + puzzle game + few side quests + the house is big and enjoyable + the powers are simple to learn + deaths were entertaining and creative + peli on suomalaisten tekemÃ¤ ja sisÃ¤ltÃ¤Ã¤ hiukan suomalaista insidelÃ¤ppÃ¤Ã¤ joten se on mainitsemisen arvoinen plussa :)  - felt like the game wasn't long enough - the graphics are not most appealing but it makes the game look more scary - characters (doesn't include lucius or lucifer) were kinda impersonal - voice acting wasn't that good - if you fail a quest you need to start the whole chapter all over again  I maybe wouldn't buy this at full price but when it is on sale it is a must have.
373	Walkthroughs Matter
374	I absolutely loved this game! The story was interesting and had me hooked the whole way. It was gruesome, fun, and paid homage to some of the greatest possession movies and stories out there in a fantastic way. Once I started it up I could not stop playing until the very end, nothing beats a night of plotting diabolical acts for a six year old demon to perpetrate!
375	Quite enjoyed this game, twas a good Saturday distraction. I managed to get 55 of the 58 achievements in under 10 hours, while also finishing the game with both endings. The remaining achievements were the running one, which I did while getting the laundry chore done (got lost enough! hehe) which I managed the following day within a half hour, and the other two were the time-based achievements (play for 20 hours and play for 40) which I'm still on my way to getting.  All in all, a very enjoyable game, though don't expect open-world, it's very scripted. This doesn't take much away from the experience though, and there is a great amount of enjoyment to be had from engineering the needless deaths of those around you.  Top story (though the acting/script could be better) and worth paying attention to, it does however give you the option to skip the cinematics (which I only used once I'd seen them already and was doing replay for achieves or random fun).
376	This game is good, if you like games where you can walk around and just cause havok. I like to play this game from time to time, when I am bored of my bigger games. This game is great, the story is a little corny, but i enjoy this game. I like the different ways you set up each person for the 'fall' they encounter and the different maze like ways in the mansion, you can get to different places. Also the story following the seasons and years also. The only thing I hate is some of the difficulties in the game are a little hard to get past, and the build up to the end of the story and having a crappy climax. Other than that an ok game to play on A rainy day. Thanks Pew Die Pie , for bringing this game to my attention. =0)
377	Went through a wall on the last floor and fell out of the map with a tricycle. Got back in from the wall next to the kitchen! 11/10 Would glitch out again
378	Spooky, scary and very satanic!  Warning! Upside-down crossed!   :p
379	amazing game pewdiepie plays it yay but all together i think it'sawesome :D
380	I fell in love with the game the minute I saw the name. Dark, creepy and really keeps you on your toes. I would recommend this to anyone who loves anything dark and creepy
381	Get to kill people with your power ''Telekinesis'' in the game and also uses strategy to kill them.  Gameplay is very fun, Voice acting was a bit late while the character moves it's mouth.  Graphics are pretty good for a 2012 game, I RECCOMEND IT!
382	This game can be difficult, but its well worth for how crazy it gets.
383	Ever wonder what it would be like to play the villain? Or need a good game to vent some real life frustrations on? This is definitely the game for you. This is a beautifully designed and rather well written dark parody of classic horror movies and video games. The story itself could take you anywhere between six to twelve hours of gameplay to beat depending on how well you fair in puzzle games. It does focus a lot more on puzzles and stealth, but has it's action moments. This game is definitely worth a pick up and play when you are bored. Personal Score: 7.5/10.
384	Lucius is quite a unique game which really caught my interest. It's not particularly a horror game, but it can be a little bit creepy at times and a lot of the deaths are pretty brutal. The game is mainly puzzle based and I think that the puzzles are quite easy, the only difficult part about it is probably locating the items. Everything graphically is good and it presents the game well in an appropriate style. I liked the achievements in this game, it really felt like I was progressing and it was quite motivating, I also liked the fun extra achievements too. However there were some problems with the game; there was a lot of laughable glitches concerning the character models, slow loading, a few crashes here and there, some freezing for a few seconds and bad lip syncing. I don't know if these (excluding glitches) were only exclusive to me though. Overall it's a nice, short game with a consistent theme, nice puzzles, nice graphics, a great soundtrack, well executed atmosphere. I recommend Lucius, especially if you like puzzles, looking for stuff, satanic stuff, murder and achievements. :)
385	damien returns in the sequel to the 1990s omen movie
386	It's hilarious!
387	Losing yourself in a giant mansion that looks more like a labyrinth SIMULATOR 2012 5/10

392	The idea is great and the it's sometimes satisfying due to the concept.  Overall though it's not something I can recommend. First off, the gameplay is just boring, outside a few stealth and combat sections this game has nothing exciting to offer as far as gameplay goes. The puzzles are sometimes nice, but mostly uninspired. The story is what kept me finishing the game, in the end I felt that it had more potential, but was still fine.  What really annoyed me though is the lack of life from most of the characters, if you can even call them characters. They have no personality, not even a glimpse of it, which would be fine if we didn't spend like I don't know, 75% of the game killing people like that. I mean as a hellspawn wouldn't it be much more satisfying to kill people who are good and have things to lose? It's more devilish, you know. Sure, everybody has something to lose, but why should we care about these people? Some of them are considered annoying â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s by Lucius himself (let alone me). And the others are just there, because somehow you must fill the mansion with people. The main characters are OK, and it's interesting to see them reacting to the events. So yeah, outside a few things this game doesn't really offer much. It's a great concept and a little bit of fresh air with the change of roles, but it doesn't execute well enough to be considered anything but a good idea.  tl;dr it's eh. 4/10
393	I got best walkthrough
394	An OK game. The gameplay is steady and fun. The achievements are quite easy to achieve (minus the 20 and 40 hour ones).  Unfortunately, replayability is not this game's strong suit. Once you have played it once (you can get all achievments on a single playthrough) there isn't any benefit to playing it again, since you know how to kill each and every one of them. The mansion's floorplan could have been better. It is very awkward to move around in and it is difficult to learn. Even after completing the entire game, I still don't have a good idea of what's where in the mansion.  7/10
395	1. Get powers 2. Kill the people u have to end 4. Turn all the crosses upside down 3. Like this if you have crippling depression
396	Lucius is a fun game. I've only played it for four Hour's and i'm almost done already. I bought this in feb But stayed off it because i couldn't run it very well. Now it's better! You should get this game!
397	Lucius is a bold attempt to put you in the shoes of an evil 6 year old with supernatural powers and a good standing with the devil in order to murder and cause mayhem amongst all other people in your home without being detected. While the developers characterize the game as an open world experience, it only takes place in the very confined place of the house and does not allow for creative approaches when it comes to murdering the inhabitants. Unfortunately, this is also my major issue with the game that has to be lauded for trying something different, but fails upon the execution - quite literally. In addition to that, controls are a detrimental to the experience and become your real enemy in the few, but frustrating fighting sequences. One can argue that a certain amount of dark humor is present, but again the execution feels forced and especially the sexual scenes add nothing except for their own sake being there. In short: Interesting concept - no buy
398	Great game. 7/10 :)

400	Hahaha, this is such an evil game.
401	Devilishly good and entertaining gameplay.
402	4.5 Stars out of 5. A really fun game to play. Only problem was sometimes understanding what your supposed to do next but you can easily find out through youtube vids. Also really easy to get 100% achievements.
403	Honestly there isn't anything negative I can say about this game. It does have amazing visuals and a great story line although I must point out this game isn't for the faint of heart or people of the Christian religion. It has a lot to do with the Devil and Dark Magic. I as a gamer don't take offense to simple video games however I am aware that many people or their family members may not entirely agree with this this game and I respect that, therefore should you be Christian or have family members who are either Christian or believe heavyly into the Bible, this isn't a game for you.
404	The game has a really neat idea, I like it although I do have some complaints: -There isn't very much direction, I understand it is meant to make you think, but some things are just completely random, I did find a guide for a little help though. -There are a few glitches, mostly just entertaing. (Mom walking in place at a door when the door is locked) -It is very linear in most aspects, ie: you can't do certain things unless you check your journal first, even if the update in the journal is a conversation you are in the middle of having.  -And a minute problem, I think the 'Devil' could have looked better. Although it's many issues, I do still like the game. I'm wondering what else may be coming out from the developers.
405	Very fun horror game. There are no jump scares or neither will this game make you â¥â¥â¥â¥ your pants.  But it is indeed horrofic, full gore, blood, and brain tissue. This is the story of a seven year old boy who bruttally murders anyone in his path, using most of the time stealth and satanic powers by making his victims look like a suicide/accident death. Example (Lucius will be): Locking someone in a freezer, forcing someone to put their head in a lawnmower, dropping icicles on people, or taking control of someone and making them jump off a roof. There are about 17 deaths and each are horrific. The map is beautiful and heavily detailed and the sidequest are fun and usefull. The story is captivating. I reccomend this only to people who can think outside the box and can solve puzzles without rage quitting. You can cheat if you get stuck using community guides, because the game is worth the story, but do not abuse it too much otherwise you are not immersed into the world of Lucius Wagner.    The game is a little pricy if you do not find beautiful graphics with great detail a bonus. So this game is a must have in your wishlist to wait fo it to go on sale. I picked up the game for 5$ very much worth it....a little too worth it.
406	I didn't know what I was in for when I got this, but I was in for a treat. The game does lack in action, gameplay, and replayability... but it makes up for it in storyline and fun.  The basic idea is that you are a little boy who is evil, cold, and heartless. Your goal... kill your rich family and its employee's. It is done by solving puzzles and making it appear like a tragic accident.  Unfortunately once you play/beat it... there is no alternative methods to really kill your objectives so its really good for one run through. It can be creepy and you might need a guide a couple off times...  But if you want to run the gambit of a child murder horror game... this is it for you. :-D (FYI - Gore, Nudity, and Cold Hearted Death.)
407	Positive surprice. I never thought that indie game inspired by 'The Omen' movies would make a good experience. Despite of the simple plot and gameplay this game succeeded to keep me playing it through without any larger pauses. The most unique thing in Lucius is damn well created cut-scenes. Especially those with murder were so stunning that they gave me cold chills. Good mixture of point&amp;click- and 'Hitman' -games, provides decent entertaiment for few hours. Play or Lucifer will have your soul!..kidding ^^ (Suomessa tehty)
408	Don't look at your map since it seems it will always tell you what you need to do next. There is no option to turn this off. Note that I have only played the game for about an hour so I don't know if this goes away. I just stopped looking at the map altogether.  With that said, if you're looking for a game where you play a character like Damien from the movie The Omen, this nails it.
409	Hahaha, this is such an evil game.
410	Devilishly good and entertaining gameplay.
411	Awesome and creative game with an eery soundtrack. There isn't much plot to the game (it's your generic Satanic horror movie story about a little kid being the anti-christ), but it's still sufficiently creepy to keep you intrigued to the very end.  Unfortunately, it is a rather short experience (I logged about five hours for my initial playthrough). Levels are fairly structured, though sometimes it can be easy to miss a certain detail and figure out what your next step is. You get several powers to use in the game, but realistically speaking, you will only use them each a few times.  I think there's room for a lot of potential here, some expansion that builds onto the story and lets you use your talents a little more creatively. But for what this game is right now, it's worth a playthrough.
412	My Favourite Little Brother!
413	Lucius is classified as an adventure game, but I feel like it deserves its own genre: Murder simulator. You play as, essentially, the son of the devil and stealthily murder people one by one. It's a twisted concept that is pulled off very well and is surprisingly fun.  Storytelling isn't this game's strong point as it isn't written or acted very well and seems to take a second seat to the gameplay. In a normal adventure game this would be a problem but here, gameplay is the focus. Otherwise it does have a similar structure to other adventure games: picking up various objects from the world, combining them, and discovering ways to use them to accomplish your current goal. Lucius is a third-person 3D game though which is unusual for the genre.  The main drawback of this game is that it can be very difficult to figure out what to do to progress, especially in the later chapters. The mansion is quite large and the game generally only gives you vague clues about where to go and rarely what you actually need to do there. You end up with a lot of useless items in your inventory which confuse things even further.  For the technical aspect, the graphics aren't very good and it requires a surprising amount of power to render them. Loading times are surprisingly long for the graphical quality but not long enough to make the game annoying to play. The engine also has a constant persistent stutter like the Gamebryo engine that seems to be impossible to get rid of.  If I had to sum up Lucius in two words, I'd say 'delightfully twisted.' It's great fun despite the technical issues and poor writing.
414	A great concept completely ruined by some of the worst gameplay decisions I've ever seen. First off, this game plays very similarly to Hitman: Blood Money - you're basically tasked with killing people and given absolutely no help as to how to go about doing it. The big difference is that with Hitman you had total freedom to explore your environment and try to figure out one of the many ways you could take out your target. In this game, the developers give you exactly one method of execution that you can't deviate from, and are expected to figure that out with only the vaguest of hints in your notebook - and by vague I mean not in any way helpful 75% of the time (in fact, many times the hint didn't even show up until I had already finished the task).  To make things even worse, you're expected not only to figure out the convoluted methods of killing the person, but also finding the various tools and items you'll need to complete the task in the sprawling mansion where the game takes place. These items could be anything and anywhere, they could be something you need to collect or a device you need to interact with, and no help is given to locate them - you basically have to wander around aimlessly until you your tiny cursor happens to land exactly on the item in order for it to highlight. You also have to be within a few feet of it for even that to work, which ultimately turns every chapter into a gigantic pixel-hunting nightmare.  You're given the choice of two final battles - one with a fire symbol and one with a puzzle symbol. I chose the fire one and ended up in a ridiculous boss fight, of all things, which was followed by a complete non-ending. The developers clearly wanted you to choose the puzzle ending, but by that point I was so over the whole game that I couldn't be bothered with even trying to play it - I just watched it on YouTube and saw that it was much more developed with several clear nods to The Omen.  I really wanted to like this game, as I loved The Omen, and essentially getting to play as Damien was a great idea. The few killings that were straightforward enough to be completed without too much frustration or walkthrough help were a lot of fun. Unfortunately too much of the gameplay was just an exasperating mess, and so I can't recommend it. If you really want to play through The Omen and don't mind frequent walkthrough checks, then you could pick this up in a cheap bundle. Otherwise you'll definately want to skip it.
415	i have some trouble with game :(  if i press M to open map &gt; crash
416	The idea for this game is great but the way it plays is really annoying. It lags cconstantly and the mouse control is horrible. The walking is way to slow and the running to fast for the lagging to keep up with and you end up running in to walls constantly. When you are given chores to do in the game it goes on for ages due to the bad controls and really just puts you off wanting to play onwards. Again its a great idea and if the problems are fixed i would happliy continue playing this game but for the moment im not planning to progress any further.
417	Yeah, I liked it. Feels so arbitrary plotted that I assume its plot is directly ripped from elsewhere, that aspect also means it's hard to have any â¥â¥â¥â¥ing clue what to do: Time for your Biology lesson Lucius! Next go steal an obscurely hidden key in room #43 and get the water bottle from the second shelf in room #3 of a million rooms, then use that to access a draw in a study with bullets and then guess the combination to a safe and take out the gun and then load the gun and don't shoot it no you have to put it on an arbitrary desk near the teacher and tell him to shoot himself and he's like what and then he does it but you don't get blamed.  I mean, no, right, I liked it. Worth like a pound, it was fun and being an evil boy is cool, it's like I was really Tulock.

420	My Favourite Little Brother!
421	Thank god they removed 2nd part of it from steam. Oh,and this game is good horror expect the scene where...you see a pair in a bed... And you are basically playing as devil child that wants to kill everyone. Via doom and 666.
422	So many ways to kill people. It's sad how addicting this game is. xD
423	Thank god they removed 2nd part of it from steam. Oh,and this game is good horror expect the scene where...you see a pair in a bed... And you are basically playing as devil child that wants to kill everyone. Via doom and 666.
424	  Puzzle game which fails at horror genre and is edgy as â¥â¥â¥â¥. But still playable, my little sister enjoyed it.
425	At first glance, this seems like a sandbox game where you use your inhuman powers to creatively kill innocent people in a variety of ways. In actuality it's simply an un-optimized puzzle game which rewards your frustrated attempts to lift an object across the room for more than 3 seconds with another unsatisfying useless power in the next chapter. The game itself had so much potential but the improper coding and limits of what you can and can't do with your powers was highly annoying. Think you're going to make awesome use of your mind-control powers to have a little fun with your victim before the big kill? Think again, you can only do anything useful with your mind-control if it relates directly to the step in the puzzle you're trying to complete right now. Think that piano is going to stay in it's proper room and on the floor? Expect to see it flying through the hall ways like a drunken pilot! Even chores will sometimes not complete once you've done all the steps required, forcing you to restart from the last save point.  I can't believe this game even made it to a sequel with how many problems the current game has but I'm glad it did. Maybe on the next one they'll have all the bugs worked out and actually make this a fun game somehow. Until then I wouldn't spend $10 on this game, let alone $20. Time to wait for Lucius 2 to come on sale and see if they actually did it right this time.  1/5 Not a very enjoyable game.
426	Delightfully demented!
427	I'm on chapter 4 of what, 20, and I'm through with this game's crappy control, annoying music, boring, linear gameplay, bad acting, bad animations, bad AI. Hell, the bathroom where the janitor I killed was working still has his todo list and toolbox two months later, WTF?  No care at all producing a game. Spent less than five bucks on sale, was not worth it.
428	Hitman for possessed children. Underrated and interesting game.
429	A perfect example of why a lack of quality assurance can turn a mediocre game into a bad one. The concept behind Lucius is a good one - you are a demonic child whose purpose is to sacrifice souls to Lucifer in exchange for power - but the execution is lacking. Rather than allow you to do anything on your own accord, Lucius plays out more or less like an old-school point-and-click adventure. Every event is coded in advance and the only thing expected from you is to follow the exact steps laid out by the game. There is no creativity of any sort, only trial and error.  Worse than that, the game is plagued by numerous bugs. The engine is poorly optimized and it's not uncommon for characters to clip into walls or objects to melt into the environment. The lighting is completely bonkers. Certain achievements don't trigger properly. The sound design is abysmal. Rather than put together a soundtrack, the developers downloaded a bunch of royalty-free 'horror' tracks and shoved them to play during the game without any sense or purpose, often completely ignoring what's going on. Get used to the atrocious 'chase scene' music from the tutorials to barge into the cutscenes that follow, even if that cutscene is a peaceful Christmas dinner.  Lucius is a game that tries to sell itself on its concept, but doesn't treat it with any kind of care. It feels like the developers simply pushed out the game, caring more about how much money it makes than whether it's actually any good. A shame, because a strong concept like Lucius could benefit from a developer who isn't completely apathetic toward their creations.
430	If you're religious don't buy this game. But I'm not, so all hail Satan ;)
431	Setting people on fire.. yes please!!
432	I fixed it so I could see the mouse, but it'd be nice if it could go fullscreen boarderless.
433	great game
434	Lucius, a 'Puzzle' game with a gloomy and dark setting.  Pros : + New kind of puzzle, I call it a puzzle to kill a person without anyone know  Cons : - You can't solve the puzzle in several ways - The puzzle clue is somewhat hard, and needs attention to solve  Why I repeat the puzzle word is because, while it's kind of new for the theme of this game, Lucius is no more that a puzzle game or point to click adventure like 'Deponia' or other games.  From the theme and review, I was expected I would have several ways to kill a person, but it seems the game didn't meet my expectation and you can kill the person with just one way, the way the game designer designed the next person will die in that way.  I hope steam allow me to do a so-so review, because while the game is kind of a new breeze in the theme, it's kind of boring because you have to roam the house just to find the correct item or way to help you kill the person. Why don't the game let you decide what do you want to do with that person way to die?  I still recommended this game to you that haven't played the game. And it would be wise if you wait until the game on sale.
435	You are playing as Satan`s child.  10/10
436	seriously love this game
437	I fixed it so I could see the mouse, but it'd be nice if it could go fullscreen boarderless.
438	An amazing puzzle game. Although it is quite twisted, I wouldnt class it under a horror genre.  The good:  - Generally speaking, it's a really fun game. - Good amount of play time, it took me 6 hours of playing to finish it. - The puzzles can be quite challenging and take some time (can be good for some, may be bad). - Involves some elements of stealth (can't get caught holding something or doing something bad, as well as not being caught running around at night). - Includes 'side quests' (you get chores to do and get rewards) - General gameplay is quite nice (other than a few bugs) - Key mapping is great and easy to use  The bad:  - A few bugs/glitches. I had to restart a few levels due to getting stuck. - Storyline lacks depth, although this does not affect the gameplay at all. - Ending (the puzzle ending) confused me a bit. Maybe it was meant to be left open ended, but I don't think this was done well at all..  Definately recommended
439	You are playing as Satan`s child.  10/10
440	Hehehehe I wish I had more time to play this game.... To cut a long story short I'm just gonna say it is 'THE OMEN MOVIE = LUCIUS'.... You play as the Son of the Devil, who's born into a rich family....your aim is to kill people while maintaining your innocent disposition... Do this by cleaning up your toys like a goodboy, then go downstairs, turn the crosses upside down and lock your nanny in the freezer room.....(accidently of course ;) Graphics are fantastic, the sound and lighting are sensational and the setting is spooky. As you're killing these people so stylishly, you cant help but grin from ear to ear....and you always feel great when you please your father (The Devil) I give this game a 9/10.... Nuff said..... I must for every disturbed player like me :D
441	I completed this game in 5.7hrs and I felt like it was an endless puzzle action game... I loved it. It had a few puns once in a while.
442	Good storyline Has a surprised and emotional ending There are many secrets But this game has lots of bugs/glitches and no one fix it. Overall: 7/10 
443	Take hours and hours to find things to get through story
444	Be right back, feeling an immense urge to kill everyone, everywhere.   It's just great.  I don't usually score games, but like someone said previously, 666/666.
445	Overall this is a very hit and miss adventure game.  It starts off well enough. Slowly introducing you to the game mechanics and drip feeding new abilities, but then the game never really goes anywhere.  A few levels in and the mansion opens up, but then most of it is pointless space with the occasional hunt for an object in one of the rooms. I feel it would have been better to restrict each chapter to a certain area, but admittedly this would feel constrained.  The solutions themselves range from pretty straightforward to bordering on the illogical. Additionally there is only one way to solve each murder and sometimes feels like guesswork to deduce the intended method (clues can be obtained using an unlockable item).  One for adventure fans to pickup on sale, otherwise avoid.
446	Kill people and get supernatural powers in return from Satan, what else do you want?   .
447	I thought this was an awesome game. If you are a fan of the Omen then i highly recommend this game.
448	OMG I love it. its great. It is well worth the money
449	Cleaned my room and brushed my teeth. I'm such a good boy!   11/10
450	Had to play for 4 times more hours of normal storytime to get all of the achievements.   Would play for 4 times more hours again to get all of the achievements.   666/666 3:)
451	Story: To start off, you're Lucius, the son of Lucifer. You're born in a rich family and only found out the truth about your true origin when you turn 6. Throughout the game, you murdered members of your household with several interesting methods to gain more powers, such as Telekinesis, where you can move objects or tinker with certain machinery with your mind.   Personally, I felt that the story is very interesting as most games that we play usually put us in the shoes of a 'I want to save the world and protect my friends' kinda protagonist. However in this game, we play the 'fk u, fk u, and fk u' kinda guy, where you simply don't give a â¥â¥â¥â¥ of the fact that you're just a 6 year old plotting to murder your entire household.   Gameplay: Similar to most sandbox games in areas such as where you can go around the manor and break stuff, explore around, talk to people, cycle around in the tricycle that was given for being a little good boy, but with a very huge difference. You can only kill someone in a set particular way. There's no other way around it. Nevertheless, it is still very interesting to witness the several different ways the game wants you to witness for the murder of each member of the household. However, due to the fact that you can only kill someone a certain way, the events and objects that you have to trigger or obtain can sometimes be fustrating to figure out yourself without looking at guides.   Achievements: All the achievements in the game are pretty easy to get. You simply have to look at guides while playing the game to make sure that you do not miss any, otherwise you have to replay the chapter that gives that achievement. However, if you want to achieve every single achievement from this game, I felt that it is pointless to try due to the fact that the last 2 achievements requires you to play 20 hours and 40 hours respectively. As mentioned before, the game only allows you to kill someone in a certain way. There's no flexibility in the amount of ways that you can kill someone, thus not giving any fun out of replaying the game again so that you can kill someone using another method. To add on, you can complete the game in 7 hours and you cannot afk in the game to achieve those 2 achievements. You would have to be 'playing' by moving around, and only that will make the game record the hours that you have played.   Graphics: Watching the gameplay of this game on platforms such as YouTube or twitch may cause some people to think that the game requires a very good graphic card to play, I have a NVIDIA NVS 5200M graphic card, which only allow me to run the game on low settings, but it still looks really good and it runs with a very decent fps of more than 60. It is still a plus if you have a good graphic card to play it on a higher setting though.  Price: Is it worth buying the game at full price? Well, $10.50 to entertain youself for more than 7 hours on average sounds pretty decent in my opinion. My call? Yes, buy it regardless whether it is on sale or not.
452	Lucius is loosely based off of the 1976 movie âThe omen.â The game revolves around a 6 year old boy, who kills members of his household to please his father; Satan.   Kinda Like it :D
453	Graphically unsatisfied. You could make it better
454	Oh boy, oh boy! What is better than being a Son of Satan and killing bunch of innocent people in your house while nobody know it's you...
455	It's good, just good.  Lore was what was keept me on the game.  Try it if you want but your expression might be 'meh, it's ok.'

468	There will be some spoilers in this review. Read at your own risk.  Lucius is a murder centric puzzle game where you play as the titular Lucius Wagner, a child of Lucifer. The premise of the game is rather interesting. Lucifer visits Lucius in a dream and bestows him the unholy mission of garnering the souls of people around Dante Manor. This is done through rather unintuitive and lacking puzzles.   The story takes place in the painfully large Dante Manor. From nearly the very beginning of the game, most of all of the manor is open to you. With the mechanics that exist in the game, this is NOT a good thing. It does not reward exploration (save for the aptly named 'Explorer' achievement). Furthermore, the puzzle solutions are extremely unintuitive and, quite frankly, boring. At several points, there shows potential for many possible ways to kill the chapter's target, but as the game requires deaths to be the ones laid out for you, it does not help at all (for example, one kill requires you to set someone on fire, but simply setting them on fire does not work. You have to douse him in gasoline and then setting him on fire will allow the kill.). More than that, the way some of these events transpire, it will severely test your suspension of disbelief (if you were to light a ciagrette at a stove, would YOU stick your face into the stove fire?) and the game simply can't be taken seriously.   Even worse still, this game at one (potentially two) point(s) tries to hopscotch between puzzle and action game. The controls and camera for this game are already pretty clunky as is and making it into a third person action game with a terrible camera does not help the game's case in the slightest. Lucius also suffers from having quite a few bugs (several things can go wrong during some chapters and will force you to restart the chapter) and collision issues (getting caught on nothing comes to mind).  Other bugs that come to mind are broken achievements. Some achievements do not work at times and can cause potential frustration.  All in all, this game is NOT worth your time or money. I got it on sale for 75% off ($4.99 instead of $19.99) and I still feel like I got ripped off.
469	Horrible game so far, Though idea is kind of nice, execution is really bad. Terrible lighting and animation, ugly character faces, too many long and boring cutscenes (which you can skip), linear gameplay, nothing about this game is good. 40 hours gameplay achieve? WTF
470	Got motion sickness from the repetitive lines and the 2005ish graphics.
471	Poor voice acting. Boring story. I honestly was about to fall asleep after watching the 5th long cutscene that is supposed to invite the player into learning the storyline, but it was just so poorly voiced and represented.
472	Very good game, especcialy for those, who want to play games with light part of fantasy. Game is something like Risen 2 and Harry Potter, but it's something better.  
473	Yes i do recommend this game it has good graphics, good story and everything to make a good horror game..
474	I Loved the game. I think it was well made but some things with the controls and game play could have been better. Only a few parts i got stuck on and got fustrated with. But overall i'd play another playthrough and look forward to some sort of sequal.
475	The Omen meets point and click adventure puzzle solving. Entertaining and provides you with some really dreadful deaths.
476	If you're a fan of old school horror movies, like The Omen, then you'll enjoy this.
477	Welcom to HELL 
478	\(._.\)  Good as  hell   (/._.)/
479	Good game. Think Hitman, but it takes place in a Mansion and you play as Lucifer's son. I Love the detail on Lucius, he looks like a ....devil.  Performance could be better, I was playing on a lower end laptop and it ran, but stutterd every now and again. Would still rec for good story, setting, and very immersive.  7/10
480	running around a big â¥â¥â¥ house made by some maze-maker with sever autism as some pre-pubescent hitler kid killing people and â¥â¥â¥â¥ for no apparent reason other than my dad is the devil and he said so.  10/10
481	this game is great and is so much fun bit sick and twisted but its got a lot of good things going for it
482	They need to make a Lucius II.  It is nice playing as the bad guy once in a while, but making the bad guy the 6 year old boy takes sinister to a whole new level. This is more of a story than a game as some of the controls are clunky and the game is completely linear. Still the game has a unique 'evil' feel about, a 'who-dun-it' atmosphere that is backed by a great musical score. **79%**
483	I was interested in the concept of this game but it just never really got me into it and I got bored fast. All the missions are very linear in that you can only kill the target in one way and it doesn't allow for any creativity or fun. Running around the mansion looking for the right items is tedious and it just doesn't have a lot of fun to it.
484	Really slow story line, amusing story telling, and overall decent atmosphere. Good when there's nothing else to play! :d
485	  One of the best games I have ever played... Wow. Everything was on point. Except for some subtitle mishaps but that didn't affect the experience much.  10/10  Had to use a guide, though, I didn't want to click through all the interactable objects in the game :D  The guesswork got boring at one point.
486	  Well yeah i would recommend this game, if someone has been â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ you off lately, most terrible ways to kill a person, (hold dis gaim away for da kids, gives ya'll f nightmares) good graphics even though it's a old game, pretty good story line, yeah ( thumbs up ) &lt;3
487	Lucius is loosely based off of the 1976 movie âThe omen.â The game revolves around a 6 year old boy, who kills members of his household to please his father; Satan.   Kinda Like it :D
488	I enjoyed every moment of this game. Except the chores! (Just kidding) It was quite good and I'll play it again to get all those achievements and kill them all once more!
489	Yes i do recommend this game it has good graphics, good story and everything to make a good horror game..
490	I Loved the game. I think it was well made but some things with the controls and game play could have been better. Only a few parts i got stuck on and got fustrated with. But overall i'd play another playthrough and look forward to some sort of sequal.

492	If you're a fan of old school horror movies, like The Omen, then you'll enjoy this.
493	Welcom to HELL 
494	I'd say the movie 'The Omen' was an inspiration for this game. You are the son of the devil and yur goal is to be a little â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Killing staff members in your giant mansion while 'Daddy Lucifer' occasionally visits to give you new gifts. Like a ouija board that hints at what you are supposed to do to kill your target for the chapter you are in. So far there have been some grizzly deaths and it has been entertaining to play and well designed. The only complaints I have is the acting is terrible, there are times where you just don't know what to do, and the AI could be much better. People walking into closed doors, and repeating themselves multiple times because they are only programed to say one line per level. But all in all, I would say it is worth the buy.
495	I got it in a steam sale and it was really cheap, like less than a cinema ticket, and its pretty cinematic and heavy enough on plot to keep me satisfied. All in all a pretty good game. An achievement hunters dream.
496	It is kind of free world, as far as the house goes, so I had to resort to a walkthrough to figure out what I was supposed to be doing next. Other than that great game.
497	Creative game, like seriously. Through out the game u feel like ur getting away with everything that u've done, and at the end BOOM u r son of satan and u burn everything down MUAHAHAHAHA, ahem.  That being said, the bicycle control is weird and the achievements r just unreasonable. I mean really, 40 hours? Who would play this game for 40 hours?  Other than that, I had fun in this game and its definiely a game u should try.
498	Surprisingly a good game with decent graphics, just let down by all the bugs and ****ed up things.   7/10
499	I'm Christian.
500	Good fun game with a lot of gore. I just love murdering my family in the morning....HAIL SATAN!

503	Welcom to HELL 
504	It'll make you a sadist. If you're a nice person you probably shouldn't play it.  7/10
505	An indie-game that requires intelligence, patience... and sometimes google.  Absolutely fascinating concept; with many, many allusions put into the game. Just the fact that the mansion is called 'Dante Mansion' is kind of a no-brainer, but passing names like Wuornos and Gacy; is lost on those who do not know. I, however, was not lost - and found the game to be refreshingly original.  It is a challenging game, not only in having to solve the 'puzzles' - but in an ethical sense.  A breath of fresh air/fire, this one.
506	I highly recommend this game for any horror fans out there. Gameplay-wise it's more of an adventure/stealth-game but the story is very similar to the movie 'The Omen'. You play as Lucius, son of the devil, and you do his evil deeds for him, mainly killing everyone in the mansion where you live, I had great fun with this one! And it sometimes is quite a challange to figure out what steps to take in order to complete the killings!
507	- Good game - Acceptable Graphs Too bad it's too short
508	The game isn't the best but it's not a disgrace so I recommend it for everyone :)
509	Much better game than I anticipated, I would've never spent 20 euros on this, but I've been keeping my eye on it as the concept intrigued me. Finally got it with an indie bundle, it's been quite fun (but I still wouldn't recommend it for that price, that's just too high). I've finished Lucius in 6,6 hours according to steam (lol the coincidence), the game allows you to free roam this mansion while you think of a way to kill your quarry, Hitman style, however, it is pretty linear in it's killings, while the world is pretty much open (you can do chores and help people to be a 'good boy' or just find stuff for chapter 7 while you're still on chapter 4 (for example, I found the revolver needed for ch 7 by randomly guessing the combination to a safe)) the solution to every kill is only one. Some solutions are harder, some are smarter, there's a fine line between freedom and story in what could be called an Adventure game, because it all boils down to you living a story and having no impact to the main events. That of course eliminates any incentive for a replay, except for the final part that has 2 endings, both which I found enjoyable, but one is better story-wise. Overall it was a fun experience for the 4,50 Euros, like following a film + adventure game, of course I wouldn't spend more than that on it, mainly because, if you have your witts with you, then the game will be over soon.
510	Play as the son of Lucifer, just make sure the grown ups do not catch you or it is back to your room and no dinner.
511	Good game, but you only realise its potential 75% through the game. Not enough playtime. 6/10
512	i love this game because it combines my two loves the first being puzzles and the second being satan. the game has a unique atmosphere and perspective, i love any game that lets you be the bad guy. i enjoy this game for the same reason i enyoy TTT in garys mod except i like this more because it forces you to be more intelligent and it means i don't have to deal with other people. i can't right a review on this game without mentioning that i broke it, there are stones that appear on the grass in the garden which you use in a puzzle late in the game, under no circumstances should you pick them up until you need them. a particularly like the things little things in this game like the crow that sits on the tree staring at you. i also need to point out that upside down crosses are not satanic. this game has one of my favourite depictions of satan in it because it is the spiting image of someone i know.
513	A twisted game that is definitely for horror fans, if you love movies like The Omen then this is for you. IMy only complaint is that the killings are scripted so there is no freedom on how you kill your victims.
514	\(._.\)  Good as  hell   (/._.)/
515	Good fun game with a lot of gore. I just love murdering my family in the morning....HAIL SATAN!
516	 Excellent plot, good animations, easy achievements and mother wearing the same clothes for months.  Recommended!!! . 
517	  What is this game exactly? Just a kid who has to find many different ways to kill everyone. Overall gets repetitive and boring and no actual plot to continue it. For the price of free I guess it was ok.    3/10  
518	This is an interesting game from a certain point of view. I enjoyed playing it, does have a special graphic and great game mechanics, the overall sound is good. Keeps you entertained and satisfied.
519	Lucius is a horror game that combines stealth killing like from Hitman games with puzzle solving but will you want to play this game ? In Lucius you play as Lucius who is the son of the devil. On his Six birthday Lucifer Grants Lucius powers but in exchange for souls which Lucius has to deliver to him by killing his fathers employees. So how is this game ? Overall Lucius is a very fun horror game. Now first the atmosphere is great. The entire game takes place in a mansion which is really confusing to navigate but theres alot of stuff to see and explore another thing thats really cool about this game is to figure out the ways that you need to dispose of enemies. You keep a journal which tells you about the victim and his or hers weakness which sometimes helps and sometimes doesnt. The game also has some illogical puzzles but just minor stuff and thats pretty much it. And plus this game takes inspiration from the Omen so you can practiclly say its Omen The video game. Overall its a really good game with a few small problems. I give Lucius a 7/10
520	Do NOT buy this game unless it's less than a $1. The only reason I've 'played' this game for 60 hours is to get that â¥â¥â¥â¥ing 'Addicted' achievement which requires you to play this â¥â¥â¥â¥ over 40 hours.
521	It's a shame Lucius is lacklustre. It's a neat concept for a dark and morbid puzzle/adventure game. It's a less-than-subtle homage to the 1976 film 'The Omen'. In it you play as the titular Lucius, a 10 year old boy to whom Satan (who looks and sounds like a poor Jack Nickelson impersonator) reveals is the antichrist. You're tasked with killing the entirety of the household, including your surrogate family, in ways that draw no suspicion to you, or your satanic nature. Asside from an entertaining concept the acting is probably the best thing about this game. Watching your family lose their minds over the inexplicable deaths tormenting them grows more and more harrowing as you progress. Unfortunately, that's where the praise ends. This game is a technical mess. Objectives are unclear, gameplay is stifling, the sidequests are boring and the glitches are rampant. I spent a whole hour on one of the early missions because you cant use your satan powers when in direct line of sight of NPCs. After looking it up in a guide it turned out I had to stand behind a small, suspended rack of meat about 2 feet away from where I was standing. On the plus side, i found out if you walk lengthways into a door while it's opening or closing, it'll slingshot you outside of the map, allowing you to get a better sense of the houses layout. Later in the game you can unlock a gun and mind-wiping abilities, but aside from the tutorial, I found no place to use either of these for the whole game. Another sidequest reward is a Jack-in-the-box, the function of which I was never able to figure out, but it had a limit of 2 charges of whatever it did. This was my reward for spending half an hour gathering socks from around the house and putting them into the laundry bin, one by one. Despite the open world, it becomes quickly apparent that there's only one way to complete each mission. Ideally, a game like this would involve forethought, strategy and precision. Instead it's just trial and error see-what-this-thing-does. For the finale of the game it takes a stark departure where you are suddenly just throwing fireballs at people like the fantastic four. It feels like the core gameplay just gave up.  Overall, Lucius is a neat concept but the execution feels rushed and incomplete. Can't recommend.
522	it sucks! big amount of glitches , boring as hell, saving system fail and NO CONTROL SUPPORT - WTF , this is a console game that you cant play with a joystick..
523	These are the kinda kids Joesph Fritzl should of kept in his basement
524	must play! if you love killing Lol!
525	The controls are stiff and the gameplay matches. While you do get to kill in roundabout ways, the entire interaction doesn't go smoothly and gets extremely boring extremely quicly.
526	Decent game. 6/10 The graphics are pretty well designed. The gameplay is a bit akward. It submerges you into the game with hardly any instruction. I was stuck on the second murder.  It's not worth the money unless you just enjoy figuring out stuff on your own.
527	demon babies make this game amazing buy this game and you get the chance to be satans little boy and murder your own family for satan with satanic powers!
528	Worst game I've seen this far. I was stuck in-game after some chapters and was never able to finish the game even with help of forums. There is also no ability to save. It looked promising but you will get detected often and 'game over'
529	This game must have been made by the devil because it's unholy. This game is the Citezen Kane of â¥â¥â¥â¥ because nothing is better than this game at sucking â¥â¥â¥â¥.
530	Love this game!! Lucius is creepy as heck though. I sometimes had to take breaks from playing because he just creeps me out too much. Overall this is a must play game... on sale for $5 what do you have to lose other than your soul...
531	  definetly one of my favorites games, Lucius, scary game, lots of blood every where and maybe the best feeling to play in the night, i must admit that the game is pretty hard, I used my internet to get some hints because you need to guess where the thing that you searching for that will help you to end the game but in conclusion its one of the best games that i have ever played, and i played alot, i give 8/10 only because that the game pretty hard
532	First time playing, this game was truly amazing, you're playing as the killer for once, as the bad guy, as the guy others fear and not the other way around. Mostly inspired by the Omen films I guess, you're basically the son of Lucifer. You live in this big mansion and you need to slowly kill basically everyone around you. Concept seemed fun, and it intrigued me to buy this game.  You'll gain different powers as you progress through the game, but most of the time, you'll need to rig something to make it count for a kill. Now my problem with this, is there are no waypoints or no hints whatsoever, it is expected from you to immediatly know what to do or where to go. You'll probably look through guides a lot while playing this.   If you miss a key item somewhere you'll be stuck till you find it. It's basically a linear game, you only have 1 choice and you can only execute the kill in a predetermined way. It's fun for the first time, but later feels like a chore. Especially with the addition of those 2 hour farming achievements, it's just a big drag.  AI is poorly designed and most of the time you'll see them crashing into walls, walking and turning around at times for no reason. Storyline is predictable if you know the genre.  I'd give this game a positive review, but it's basically a 1 time play. Those hour achievements could've been better if the game had a new game + mode, or a mode in which you could preform kills in a different way. All in all, overall disappointed with the game, had a lot of potential.
533	If you liked the Omen you will love this game.
534	I never thought being the child of Satan would be good fun. I do have a few problems with this game, but would recommend it overall. I feel like some of the achievments are a bit ridiculous and time-consuming, yet aren't fun. (Side note: I have been trying to get the music box achievment and still cannot get that even though I am sure I am right.) There are some things in the game that do not run as smooth as I would like, but this is an older game so it is actually kinda impressive. Just be careful using your tricycle because you might get stuck in a wall. It happens, no big deal. Some of the voice acting is a little cringy, but the gameplay itself is pretty fun. The story isn't exactly award-winning, but it doesn't totally suck either.   TLDR: Game isn't bad, and it fun but I personally would not pay full price for it. Achievements are annoying at times. Game itself, ignoring achievements, its entertaining. Not the best game, not the worst.
535	  definetly one of my favorites games, Lucius, scary game, lots of blood every where and maybe the best feeling to play in the night, i must admit that the game is pretty hard, I used my internet to get some hints because you need to guess where the thing that you searching for that will help you to end the game but in conclusion its one of the best games that i have ever played, and i played alot, i give 8/10 only because that the game pretty hard
536	The good first: Lucius is interesting, macabre, and keeps you wondering who you get to kill next. The storyline is pretty good. A couple of twists keep it interesting (even if you sort of see them coming, you get to say 'I knew it!'). I really did enjoy this game, and it's a game that I would reccommend... if you get it on sale.  The bad: The game gives you literally no options. You have to do everything in EXACTLY the way the developers intended, or you can't complete the chapter. Personally, I'd prefer a little bit of an option on how to kill my victims... I don't want to complete elaborate schemes with no choices. Often, quick timing is required with skills that are less than precise, which can prove to be incredibly frustrating. I do not recommend it to those who rage easily. One scene alone I played for about 45 minutes before I could beat it, and had to continuously kill myself to start the chapter over. Furthermore, there is no 'save' or 'load' option. If you lose a level, you start at the beginning of that level. The levels aren't too long though, so it didn't bother me too much. Some of the cutscenes are very long; I was almost late to work because I was determined to get through the cutscene(s) that were playing, and it took 14 minutes (I had figured itwould only be 2-5 minutes). It's pretty glitchy, and some of your 'powers' are very difficult to control.  Overall: I do recommend this game. It's an interesting premise. Although it could have been better executed, I took it for face value and thoroughly enjoyed it. If glitches or elaborate gameplay irritate you, this may not be the game for you. If you can work around the glitches and enjoy games that are more like movies that you interact with, it's 100% for you.
537	you get to â¥â¥â¥â¥ up your whole family and be satan 10/10 in my books.
538	Too Many Unskippable Cutscenes  That's basically the one fatal thing about this game I've got 50 mins in the game and I â¥â¥â¥â¥ you not 30 of those were spent between cutscenees and loading screens. It is neither difficulty nor nerve that prevents me from going forward in this game, it's dreading more of those unskippable cutscenes. I bought this game to play a devil child, not watch some cgi re-enactment of 'The Omen'
539	It\'s fun to kill people but this game is boring af
540	Great family game. Recommended for children ages 4-6.
541	This game seems half â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Like they released an alpha and then just ran with it.
542	You can't save the game, for starters. So everything you do, you have to start all over again next time you want to play. If you can manage to play it all in one sitting, then props to you. The story is only mediocre at best. The game play is only 'alright'. All in all, it isn't enough to capture my attention for more than an hour.
543	I am Lucius, six-year-old son of Lucifer. I can shatter objects with telekinesis, control peopleâs minds, erase memories and even set things on fire with the power of thought alone, but right now, Iâm running around a house carrying a single dirty sock. Iâm supposed to be killing someone, but to draw attention away from my suspicious behaviour, Iâm doing some chores around the house for my mum. One of those chores involves collecting dirty socks and underwear from various peopleâs rooms and taking them to the laundry room, and it takes forever because I canât carry more than one sock at a time. There is something very wrong here.
544	The son of the devil possesses all the grace and maneuverability of a pontoon boat with rocket thrusters. Who told you people this game was finished? It is a struggled just to walk through a door. Seriously. I'd like my $5 back.
545	don't bother. Buggy unfinished and Linear. Frustrating endgame, poor design. Decent concept but no imagination and very scripted use of powers. Dissapointing
546	This game makes me sad. It's a classic story of 'so much potential.' You basically play as a little devil-spawn kid (ala 'The Omen') and run around the house plotting and executing the murders of various occupants in your house without getting caught.  The gameplay isn't bad, but it takes far too long to figure out what your objective is and where the things you need to achieve it are. It would be a lot more fun if you could wander around exploring and gathering and then choose an execution method based on your inventory, rather than having to find the items for the single available method.  The other problem I had with this game was that it has far too many cutscenes which last for too long and happen too often. It interrupts the gameplay. At one point, you have to sneak out of your room to get some rat poison. You have to sneak around without being noticed, which is actually a good deal of fun. So I picked up the rat poison and expected to have to sneak back, but instead there was a cutscene that had me waking up the next morning. One of the best parts of the old Thief game was trying to get back out after you've accomplished your goals. No such 'extra drama' here. Just do your task and watch the next cutscene.  I was very happy I was able to give this game a try, but I can't say I recommend it. It's just too frustrating, the voice acting is poor, the characters are either unbelievably mean or oblivious, your actions are too limited, and worst of all, the story isn't compelling.
547	I haven't played this game for very long yet but from what I have I can tell I'm utterly annoyed the controls, the way the menu works and the amount of bugs.  It's sad because the concept is good. I like the idea of playing as a kid who kills people and has the ability to contact with the â¥â¥â¥â¥in' Devil but...this game didn't put it off very wel. I certainly won't stop trying to enjoy this game but I won't recommend it at all.
548	I guess, seeing trailers a lot of people may get an impression that Lucius is something like sandbox killing game... a Hitman game with demonic powers. Sadly - it's not.  In a game, you play a role of Lucius, a young boy, who - thanks to his Grandfather's occult involvement - posses demonic powers. Each month, he's visited by Lucifer himself and each month he has to kill a new target. It's an interesting, if not slightly controversial concept, which should have allowed for wide spectrum of possibilities. And even first 3 of the chapters show a fair amount of potential that this game should have used to maximum.  Well, the main problem of the game is that - there are no alternative solutions to a problem. After 5 or 6 missions, you realize that - even though 'the playground' is getting bigger and bigger - the concept and possibilities the game gives you stay exactly the same. This essentially makes the game just a shallow adventure game, where player's task isn't to find the best way to kill a target, but finding a way that developer's designed.... even if it doesn't make a lot of sense. And so - in later levels, you're running back and forth, through a gigantic mansion, trying to find that one object that you need to finish up your task, only to find something that is as big as rock or battery(!). This alone wouldn't be so bad, if the game gave you enough hints on what you're looking for or what you have to do, but that isn't a case.  Not only that - the game sometimes doesn't even fallow the rules of 'smart level design' and places many objects that you have to use in shadows and badly lighten places - the type of places, where a player is least likely going to look for them. I remember being stuck in chapter 10 for good 10 minutes, only to realize that objects I was looking for were hanging on the wall - the only place in the entire the room, that was in the shadows. Finally, the design on a mansion itself is extremely confusing and it's going to take good few hours, before you're going to learn where to go, to not run in circles.  From all of that, you may get an impression that I completely hated the game. That isn't the case. When everything was going fine and I had any idea what to do, where to find it etc. - the game was fairly entertaining. And storyline - even though, idea behind it felt flat on its face after 7 chapters - kept me interested enough to keep playing till the very end. The number of achievements also helped quite a bit, making me feel rewarded even for the most minor of tasks.  When it comes to graphics - Lucius looks decent. It's more or less something that I'd except from a game of this calibre. There are few textures that don't look right and few places in a house, that feel empty, but it isn't anything game breaking. Character animations sometimes look a little stiff - especially facial animation could use some work. There are also some weird problems with optimization, where a framerate drops in some areas for no obvious reason, but - once again - because it isn't really an action game, I don't consider it a major problem.  Lucius also has a decent music. Although, by the end of the game, you'll hear each of the tracks way too many times. Sound assets are good and fitting for the most part. Voice acting however is a mixed bag. I've played an English version and I personally wouldn't say that for the most part actors are doing a bad job. It's more of a case that script they had to work with and lines they had to deliver aren't very good. It's also obvious for me that in many places, they weren't given enough directions on how should they play their roles, which results in some hilarious conversations in few parts of the game.  Bottom line - I'd avoid Lucius for the price of 20â¬ or even 10â¬. However - with 75% discount, I could recommend it to people that like adventure games or simply don't mind checking walkthroughs. It's a 6-8hrs long mediocre game, that sometimes shows its potential, but at the same time - is flawed with problems.
549	It\'s fun to kill people but this game is boring af
550	Too Many Unskippable Cutscenes  That's basically the one fatal thing about this game I've got 50 mins in the game and I â¥â¥â¥â¥ you not 30 of those were spent between cutscenees and loading screens. It is neither difficulty nor nerve that prevents me from going forward in this game, it's dreading more of those unskippable cutscenes. I bought this game to play a devil child, not watch some cgi re-enactment of 'The Omen'
551	Saw this game on sale and thought I'd try it out.  Haven't stopped playing it since purchase and can truly say it's amazing for those who love a good little horror game :) Recommend to those with a tough gut and sick humour &lt;3  
552	You can't save the game, for starters. So everything you do, you have to start all over again next time you want to play. If you can manage to play it all in one sitting, then props to you. The story is only mediocre at best. The game play is only 'alright'. All in all, it isn't enough to capture my attention for more than an hour.
553	This game seems half â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Like they released an alpha and then just ran with it.
554	Great family game. Recommended for children ages 4-6.
555	A very good game with beautiful art about how is a common day in the life of satan's son.   Pros: - Good story - Good voice acting. - Violence  Cons: - Short gameplay - Some bugs
556	it has a pretty bad storyline, but if you want to you can â¥â¥â¥â¥ around with stuff in the house
557	This must be the feeling  to be like Damien Thorn.
558	restarted game for tricycle      SO â¥â¥â¥â¥ING WORTH IT.   
559	10/10 would never play again even though I would be given a nailgun at the beginning
560	Its an awesome game. You have to give it a try you won't be disappointed, cant wait for Lucius 2
561	666
562	I felt where this kid was coming from and so i have to rate this good.
563	10/10 would never play again even though I would be given a nailgun at the beginning
564	10/10 would never play again even though I would be given a nailgun at the beginning
565	I felt where this kid was coming from and so i have to rate this good.
566	  You play as the son of the Lucifer who goes on a killing spree while hiding in plain sight and make sure nobody suspects you in this game. Sounds fun, right?  Sadly, no, this game isn't as fun as it sounds on theory.  I really tried to like this game, I really did. But with mediocre story, boring puzzles, annoying music, confusing gameplay (you'll definitely need a walkthrough at some points) and not to mention the random glitches, I just cant make myself recommend this on a full price. Luckily this goes on sale/giveaway every so often so if you still feel like giving it a try, get it then.
567	I will admit I haven't played the game very far in (as far as I can tell), but it just felt bland. The first few kills had no challenge to them, as the game basically told me what to do. Then the next one, the butcher, found me in a room with no intuitive way to kill him at all as far as I could tell. I looked up a guide and without giving spoilers, it didn't feel creative or fun. Sure, it may sound like I want this game to both be easy and hard all at once, but quite frankly, if the in game journal didn't tell me how to beat the first kills, I probably would have wandered around this massive house even longer than I did. This game was advertised as being some interesting psychological thriller where I get to plot my family's demise and frame victims, but I didn't feel in control of my gameplay experience at all. I got a game that said 'click this, put this here, someone dies', and if that's what I wanted out of a game, I'd have just downloaded The Sims and lit a house on fire.
568	Wish to kill your household members in a gruesome way? If yes, this the game for you. It can be whip to get your brains whacked up to think and plot your murder. Despite the bugs, which can be really infuriating sometimes; this game is a gem of sorts. Head chopping, sending a nail through the face, burning a man alive... These are some of the ways of murder you will experience, which can be really satisfying. This game is gem, i hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did.
569	HOW did i miss this AMAZING game until now!? IT IS AMAZING!! you basically play as Damian from the Omen... and it's HELL ON EARTH! hahaha!!
570	Pretty good game. It is an amazing horror game where you have to murder people living in your own house... AS A SIX YEAR OLD! Might sounds weird but it is pretty fun for some odd reason.
571	This is fun i would reccomend it xD
572	Boring. Plays like a crappy version of Hitman, but with only like one way to kill targets.
573	I bought this on sale and got 10 hours of entertainment. The deaths are creative and gruesome but it's a shame there is only one for each target, this considerably reduces any replayability. What a shame there isn't a level editor.
574	Some of the cringiest modelling and voice acting I've ever seen.  Horrible map design, horrible quest design, really just quite a poorly made game in general.  3/10
575	Holy Crap, was this not any where even remotely close to the game I was expecting and in this case, that's a bad thing.  Don't come into this game thinking its a free roam multiple choice adventure where you play the Antichrist, no, rather its a very linear, do it this way or not at all, bore of a game. There is no deviation of choice, there is no abuse of demonic powers, just very sepcific ways you have to kill people placed in an open world to give you the illusion of choice when really it just pads the game out to make it seem like its worth a whopping $20 dollars. This game is not worth its full price or even on sale, its worth a dollar, because this isn't really a game: its an interactive movie. Go watch the Omen, its a superior expeirence, and make sure its the original and not the remake.  The negatives aside, the deaths were amusing once in awhile and I had more fun donig chores and exploring around the house then I had fun playing the main story.  2/10, take your money else where.
576	Thats ok son!I'll bring some body for kill them if u don't like them.  LucÄ±os is like problem kid,he directly become psychopath when saw someone around not like. Nice game if u wanna make ur self nerveus,very well go ahead :-/  Some of control not good enough in game when u set up new skill(s),details same like 'Max Payne' . 7/10  Creator/Producer that's ok son,i paid for it n u earned well.Isn't it?
577	Doesnt work for me Menu is glitched  10/10 IGN would buy again
578	Also try 'Lucius II'.
579	This is a game I got on sale for $1. The most i'd pay for it is maybe 3, and after getting to chapter 5 i can't recommend it. Figuring out how to kill your victims is an extremely boring process, probably even more so if i didnt use any walkthroughs or anything like that. It's also a big flaw that each of the victims only has one way they can die, so you get no freedom in that, which is what would make the game fun (if it had it). Kinda fun, very very boring and not worth the work once you finally figure out how to finish the chapter. I'd only recommend it it's on a big sale.  p.s. my hours aren't accurate, ive probably left the game open on accident a few times.
580	Fun to play. I liked it.
581	  You play as the son of the Lucifer who goes on a killing spree while hiding in plain sight and make sure nobody suspects you in this game. Sounds fun, right?

582	Just not fun. Its almost like a puzzle game, but it is made in a weird way that just doesn't work at all. It's a cool theme, being the spawn of satan, trying to kill random people without being suspected or worse, cought red-handed, but it's just so difficult to play. I think there's a second one, so I would look that one up. Probably fixed a lot of bugs and functionality.
583	OmerGherd such a goood game!!! :D Kill people and no one knows its the little kid!! MWHAHAHAHHA &gt;:) Any way haven't really played a LOT of this game but with what i have played a freakin' LOVE it! :D GET IT NOW WHILST ITS LIKE 74P!!!
584	I tried to get into this but i can't i simply can't
585	:v Nice Game And Nice Porn c:
586	this game is a yes but lemme tell you something ,  good: the graphics are good , 60 fps lock on vsync , mind games , easy achievements , chores and gifts ,  bad : after the last update (or so i noticed) : alot of bugs , if i ride the tricycle into the wall in the alastair stairs/backroom , it noclipped and i got out to the street , picked ivor's bottle on chapter 4 first time and i gave it to tom , now i restarted couldn't get it , i can take the one in the closet only , after killing alastair on christmas , he lived on tom's chapter , dunno how but he was standing there , driver smoke chapter the rug i am supposed to make him sniff didn't fall with him , stayed floating . i killed lucius' mom on chapter 6 by fault and no one noticed , you don't need to go put the plug to load the nailgun with air , when i killed susan she jumped from the bathroom and then everyone was flying including me and the house was underneath us , i have much more of these glitches screenshotted in my profile ..  flashlight lucifer's head and see what happens ,   all in all , 8/10 one of the best mind devilish games i have played    EDIT: would recommend this game when it's on sale ! not worth over 15 if you like playing long story driven games , the story is short but awesome gameplay
587	gonna play this, recommended
588	it gets borin but hey i got it on sale i really cant â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ for a game i bought for 0.99$
589	The game first appears to be some kind of  The Omen  tribute, where you can raise all Hell and make a mess of this little imaginary world. It could not be more far from the truth. But it does result to be a good puzzle-solving grotesque game. It will get your brains to hurt, not for its difficulty, but for the absurdity of some of them. I highly recommend to play it with a walkthrough and a guide, and trust me, you will thank me later. Bizarre, bloody, a sin itselft for some - but certainly fun. Turn down your crosses and leave your Jesus Christ crap at home, buddies!  6/10
590	Saw boobies, gave review.
591	It's good, the end is weird, but it's good.
592	great game
593	I wanted to like this game but the controls and save function kept me constantly frustrated so I stopped playing it. Wish there was an arrow option and for the love of God why no saving??? Dear every game developer: Allow us to save at will. Why they refuse to add this function is beyond me. You will get a thumbs down from me every time if you don't allow that.
594	To all atheists, and agnostics, this is actually a fun game. It would remind you of the Hitman series if you're familiar with it. The controls are a bit clunky, and the graphics are not bad per se, but the gameplay's nice. I wouldn't consider it a 'fun' game, though. There's no replayability, except when you want to get all the achievements. So, technically, the interesting aspect of this game is its story.   The death scenes of your targets are fun to watch, though.   Overall, it's a good game, not great, not bad. Just good. Also, there are not many games that focus more on Satanic references and all, so this is one of the good ones.  To all devoted Christians, nothing to see here. Move along.
595	If you are super religious God would probably look down on you for playing this game. It makes you evil to the core.
596	A very good game, I highly recommed for people who like puzzle solvings and, hell, this game is quite funny sometimes.
597	Bought this game because my wife likes these type of games.. She seems to like it.. controls are a little frustrating but overall it is good.
598	I feel that this game has no freedome of playstyle. It is very boring and I would not recommed it to anyone who likes to stay awake while playing a game!
599	Saw a person, killed them Saw another person, killed them too Oh and saw another person...killed them But I did see the Devil, I didn't kill him
600	  ....
601	Yeah it has a few gameplay bugs, but nothing that fully derails the experience. It's almost therapeutic to be the bad guy for once. The VERY VERY bad guy.  So see life from the other side for once...just please, don't try any of this at home ;)
602	It had so much potential and fails miserably.
603	I feel that this game has no freedome of playstyle. It is very boring and I would not recommed it to anyone who likes to stay awake while playing a game!
604	If you're looking for a positive review, then you're in the wrong place, HOWEVER, if you're here for a tremendous chicken Stir Fry recipe, THEN LOOK NO FURTHER!  - Serves 4 - 10 mins to prepare and 10 mins to cook - 325 calories / serving - Healthy  INGREDIENTS:  - 1 orange, zested and juiced - 2tbsp soy sauce - 2tbsp sesame oil - 250g (8oz) tender stem broccoli - 5cm (2in) piece root ginger - 1tbsp sunflower oil - 1 garlic clove, finely sliced - 1 red pepper, deseeded and thinly sliced - 150g Straight To Wok Noodles - 400g (13oz) chicken fillet, cut into thin slices  METHOD  Step 1 - Mix together the orange zest and juice, soy sauce and sesame oil and set aside.  Step 2 - Blanch the broccoli in boiling water for 2 minutes, then drain well and set aside.  Step 3 - Finely shred the ginger. Then heat a large frying pan or wok, add the sunflower oil, heat it until sizzling, and fry the ginger till it's crisp.  Step 4 - When it's done, remove with a slotted spoon. Add the chicken and garlic, and stir-fry until just browned. Remove the meat using a slotted spoon and set aside.  Step 5 - Add the red pepper and broccoli and stir-fry for around 2-3 minutes until it's just tender. Add the soy sauce mixture, bring it to the boil then return the chicken to the pan and heat through. Serve with noodles.
605	If I could remove this game from my library I would :cgpout:. The game story isn't new I know but I guess it's hard to be this much evil even in a virtual world, not that anyone is absolutely good, but still this is just too much. I do like to play a villain from time to time. It's fun and thrilling. They usually have a nice background story attached to them, too. Lucius lacks the depth and roundness of a villain character.It focuses more on evil for the sake of being evil and no reason at all besides that.You play as a six year old hell-spawn who is bent on mercilessly torturing and killing other NPCs. The game gives the player the tools to creatively excute the non-suspecting NPCs. I'm only not recommending the game because of its emphasis on the game major source of fun which is killing.  You can be evil and wreak havoc without spilling one drop of neither real nor virtual blood, that's creativity in its finest!
606	I really anticipated this game ever since it was first announced. I waited for it to be released. And then it did, and the reviews were not kind. I thought I will still like it, until I started the game. 19 minutes later I wrote this review.  It was the most boring opening I have ever seen. The background music was the most uninspired I have ever heard. The voice acting was jarring at best. Stiff and emotionless. The writing lies somewhere between banal and cliche, at times unapologetically indifferent, or unapologetically dumbass, for the lack of a better word. A woman died and the police concluded it was heart attack, and the detective who just arrived concurred, stating that it was typical of women her age, before he even set foot into the house. That was all I could take before I shut down the game.  Controls were unintuitive. Explanations were a mystery in itself. I spent 3 minutes trying to figure out how to use a lock when you don't have a way to select it even when you see it on screen. In the previous step, the game told you to pick it up, then it instructed you to 'holster' it. Then the game asked you to use it, without explaining that you need to 'unholster' it before you can use it. Brilliant.   In the 19 minutes that I have played the game, I have probably played it for 5 minutes. I spent the other 14 waiting for the game to load, watching slow moving cutscenes that tells you what you already know, listening to words that hardly inspires, instill fear, or peak my interest in any way. It was more interesting watching paint dry.  Also, instead of opting for a first person perspective, the developers wanted to replicate a movie feel and go third person instead. I know, they are trying to recreate the tricycle scene of The Shinning, but ever wondered how awkward it is to control someone in-game like that? And that's not to mention how they always have to center the camera looking directly at Lucius, who admittedly looked creepy in the game. It's a wonder then, how no one suspected him.  Do I recommend this game? No. Will I continue to play it till the end? No. Will I buy Lucius II? No. Should you play this game? Depends. If you are patient and don't care about quality as much, you may enjoy it. If you are critical like I am, you will balk at the notion that this game was even made.
607	Bought this game because my wife likes these type of games.. She seems to like it.. controls are a little frustrating but overall it is good.
608	First Impressions: You're a little â¥â¥â¥â¥ devil child that murders people and makes it look like accidents. If you're looking for a satanic murder puzzler then this is it.  7/10
609	Amasing game love it i like it more then Lucius 2 myself man i really like just taking screen shots of the deaths. 8.5/10
610	Originally I was sceptical about this game, but it was a really nice surprise for me. Story is pretty good and interesting, event with really weird ending (at least the action one, the puzzle one is a much better). Graphics is nice with solid performance optimization. The problems of this game are the bugs... many bugs. Many times I was stuck behind some stuff and I could get out from there, once I even somehow fall out by the texture to the outdoors and could not go back to the mansion. Also the game is loading too long always and when you encounter a bug you have to load the game over and over again (at least I've encountered critical bug when I had to load the game again only about 3 times). Game is also pretty short, it took me only 7.6 hours to get 56/58 achievements and now to get the rest of them I have to be ingame for 40 hours total... Like WTH, it is not even counting to be in menu, so I could just let the game running and doing something else and now I have to add another monitor to have the possibility to do something else if I want that achievements.  But despite the game having some negatives, I still recommend this game. 7/10
611	Heyyo, It's a neat and fun indie game... some of the ways you commit the 'murders' or 'assissted suicides' are pretty neat. It's a good game for the low price.. just not a very long game.
612	When I first heard that they had finally decided to make Little Nicky into a video game, I had my reservations. I assumed it'd basically parrot back a bunch of snarky remarks from the film and follow the same [Oddball Character Introduced &gt; Conflict Arises &gt; Oddball Not Such A Bad Guy &gt; Oddball Makes Friends &gt; Oddball Gives Up &gt; Friends Rescue Oddball &gt; Everyone Falls In Love With Everyone] plotline that every other Adam Sandler movie has followed. But the creator gives the story an interesting twist! (Except the ending. Your Uncle Tom has sex with everyone in the mansion and then the game ends, so that's kind of the same.) But in this game Adam Sandler actually plays a role other than Guy With Fart Machine! In this game, Adam Sandler is Malcolm McDowell. First, the conflict arises. Your jerk of a Dad, like, wants you to rule hell and stuff. But instead of being all, like, 'BUT DAAAAD I DON'T WANNA RULE HELL! I WANNA PLAY WITH MY FART MACHINE!' Adam Sandler's all like 'This works for me. Killing idiots is fun. Does this humanitarian gesture come with a dental plan?' Then comes the part where Adam Sandler WOULD prove he's a good guy. And then, this is crucial now...he's NOT a good guy. He starts killing people and they, like, want to be friends and stuff because he's got, like, a moonpie face. But Malcolm McDowell Sandler is like ADAM SANDLER DON'T NEED NO MAN and like stuffs people in light sockets and stuff. Oh my god it's so cool. And your grandpa's all like FAMILY BONDING IS IMPORTANT and Adam Sandler's like I AIN'T NO GRANDPA'S BOY and guts him like a saggy skinned old fish. Then would come the part where he would give up because the cops and church are like 'I've never really been able to actually CONVICT anyone of a crime, but...process of elimination tells me that you must be the killer since, like...errbuddy ded lol' but does Adam Sandler give up and wait for his friends to save him? NO. Old Sandler might, but McDowell Sandler's crazy like a fox! He's all like GET IN THAT LIGHT SOCKET. And then the devil's all like BRO...I RESPEK YOU and then the game ends and you're, like, funny like Adam Sandler, but also not a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.  In conclusion; this Adam Sandler is cooler than real Adam Sandler. So if you don't like Adam Sandler movies, that's ok because this one's better. If you do like Adam Sandler movies, but also liked The Happening, then this is good too because New Malcolm Sandler also has these, like, tree powers than let him tell disco fans and college kids to put their faces in woodchippers.  8/10 Needs more Adrian.
613	First Impressions: You're a little â¥â¥â¥â¥ devil child that murders people and makes it look like accidents. If you're looking for a satanic murder puzzler then this is it.  7/10
614	Fantastic game!
615	More like explore the mansion simulator,a real mediocore game,could be better if the house wasnt so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing big. Pros: - 9,99$ for this game is worth it. But you should wait for a sale more like for 1.49$ or something - 20+ Hours if you explore look for secrets and simply have fun with the mansion -Creative ways to kill -Lots of details -Nicely optimized -AI is kinda good... -You're a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing demon and a son of Lucifer how cool is that?! Cons: -IN THIS EPISODE OF WAT! DAFUQ AM I SUPOSED TO DO HERE  -LUCIOUS LOOKS LIKE A LITTLE â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥  -BORING CHARACTERS! -THIS ISNT A HOUSE BUT A â¥â¥â¥â¥ING MAZE -CONTROLS SUPPORT SO â¥â¥â¥â¥ING AWFUL -WHAT AM I SUPOSED TO DO WITH THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING DEMON POWERS THEY HAVE NO USE AT ALL! Conclusion: But either way It's a nice game,but avoid this â¥â¥â¥â¥, 69/100 just because there is a nude scene ( Í¡Â° ÍÊ Í¡Â°) and It's nice for a chil after playing all those FPS and head exploding games. Get it only if you are a story kind of player.
616	I played this once and to be honest, Its a really good game. I bought it again....because of......ACHIEVEMENTS.....DUN DUN DUN.  This game deserve a rating of 99999/10 Thanks 4 reading.
617	â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up devilish game
618	Great idea, bad execution.  The entire game feels really repetitive and gets boring after a couple hours. I have never really gotten into the story even though I have finished it. Bad voice acting and limited gameplay most likely contributed to it.   Pros:  - Interesting idea   Cons:  - Limited gameplay. You have only one way to complete your mission even though there are a lots of possibilities that you can think of. - Bad voice acting. It is cringe worthy at times. - Frustrating hints. It's either a little hint per stage or no hints at all. I've spent quite a lot of time just running around the house trying to find something to progress further. Eventually I got bored and had to look up for a hints online.

625	fun game, just don't play it if you're under 10 years old, there are enough underage psychopath killers in this world we don't want another. Worth playing this game though not worth buying the second game
626	Good concept and story, but sometimes glitchy.
627	I don't get the wow feeling when killing people, just the meh generic feeling.
628	The Omen ripoff, really liked it.
629	wow this game left me with so many mixed feelings being an Omen fan will leave you loving the house's layout, the graphics are fine and most of the murders are fun the gameplay gets long and boring not long after, unlikeable characters, buggy physics, stupid final mission
630	Great game, classic, and I beat it within the four hours I played. Not worth buying for the $10, asI bought it on sale for $1, so I would wait until then.

632	  Ive only played 13 minutes i dont remember playing this game i think its fun. ( Í¡Â° ÍÊ Í¡Â°)
633	BEST GAME EVER ~_~ STEAM TRADING CARD ART IS THE BEST!
634	So, my internet isn't great, and yet I really wanted Lucius. So I got it and downloaded it overnight. During the night, I had the weirdest dreams ever. When I woke up, I looked at the download. It had finished, but when I glanced at the download meter, I noticed that the highest kb/s it had reached was 66.6.  666/666, would be cursed by Satan again
635	It's like Hitman, but you play as a 6 year old hellspawn instead.  10/10
636	HAIL SATAN!!! 9/11-IGN
637	Great game!
638	I don't really know what to say but when i was trying to play it was messing up, I can't do the first kill because the maid wouldn't go in the freezer and one of my friends said it was laggy and buggie so i don't know what to do with it

647	A six-year old killing everyone in the mansion  why?  For the glory of satan of course!  10/10
648	It's definitely one of my favourite games.  Creative Fun Addictive Cheap price
649	Did you like Hitman?  If answer is yes, then get Lucius.  If answer is no, then bog off and go back to The Sims.  Why is it similar to Hitman? Accident. The safest, the hardest, but the most sophisticated way to get rid of someone. Let no shadow of suspicion lay on you. The farther into the game, the more powers you possess and they stronger they become. Use your hiding skills, use items, use devilish powers to achieve what your 'Father' tells you and don't get caught. Even if they find you, you still have a chance to escape. How? 'Father' teaches you how to trick weak people to act according to your will (or rather His will).  Anyway. You are Devil's disciple and you have to kill your targets. Area of your actions isn't big - it's a manor. 3 floors. Several people. Each must be killed in a specific way. Lucius is a very linear game. You can't choose targets and means to kill them. Your task is to figure out how to achieve this predicted result. You have the 'tools', sometimes you have to find certain items, but in general you have to play in a specific way to set things (sometimes literally) in motion. Push them over railing. Kill them with an icicle. Burn them... and many others. Souls is what you need.  Satan is your Master and you do what he says. Please him and bring him more souls.  Graphics is fine. Sound is fine. Music is nice. Location is ok (a bit empty at times). Mechanics is simple. Story is good. Pacing is ok.  So what's wrong with this game? Very linear. Little replay value. Simplicity.  As with every game you expect to play it more that one time or at least offer something more on another playthrough. That's not happening.   My suggestion is to treat Lucius like and point and click adventure game (just this time happening from 3rd person perspective). Those don't allow second playthrough as they serve all they got in first playthrough. Try to figure out puzzles on your own. If you like stealth, puzzle and adventure genres then Lucius is a good choice. It is a solid game overall, but nothing else.
650	Unlike real games, Lucius gives you almost no hints. It's a 3rd person game where you use your powers to murder people as you play as the son of the devil. More people you kill, the more your power grows in the story. The first time is a tutorial and basically tells you how to kill the first person and you're told each and every new target you get a hint in the jurnal. The hint is invisible to me or doesn't give me much of a suggestion. I was meant to kill some guy who smoked, ok. I realised damaging the gas on the cooker would be the point, however I had no idea how to make him go into the kitchen and light up.  A very interesting idea, but it falls flat and the arm animation on the characters seem a little...off.
651	You get to kill a guy with a saw using telekinesis 10/10 would recommended to those under 12 with Satanic urges.
652	came across far too many glitches in the game when playing... so now i am not even going to play anymore... between someone walking into the freezer, instead of into the hallway... and dropping the toy into the box but it keeps resetting... and then having to quit because of a glitch and sending me back another 10 minutes... screw that
653	This game is horrible.
654	Lucius name should be Satans-Little-Helper...
655	this is the worst garbage that i have ever played... i want my 2.99 back
656	Spawn of Satan simulator.

674	This game is awesome.
675	This game is just 0 out of 100
676	Only played 82 minuted so you can hardly call this a review but this game has one of the most just down right depressing graphics and storylines ever! Kind of fun i guess, the first 4 missions take like 3 minutes to finish even less, but not one of the worst indie titles on steam, also the voice acting sucks aids, but i would not pay full price for this crap it's not worth it wait until it's on sale or get a retail cdkey from the internet. 4/10

678	To be very blunt, this game was not what I was expecting. I was kind of expecting a sand box-y style horror game where I would be given mission(s) and could choose to fulfill them however I wanted, what I soon discovered was that this is more of a point and click adventure game, where they expect you to follow very specific rules and paths in the game. On top of that, the graphics suck, they are kind of outdated, like Grandtheft Auto 3 graphics and even on good hardware seem to have issues with frame rates.   Quite frankly, it's a massive disappointment.  It would have been amazing if I could go about killing the people in the house, how I wanted, with multiple endings and murders, but that just isn't what this game is like.   What's even more annoying is at the start of each mission, they usually give very, very vague hints and that's about it. I don't expect a puzzle to be handed to me, but when all you give me is like, 'I don't like this person' and that's it, it can become incredibly difficult.  The AI is also â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ to say the least. During the tutorial the characters mother spent the entire time simply walking up against a locked door watching me do the entire thing without saying a word.   it's not even remotely close to a 'open world' when not only are rooms locked off if you have no buisness being in them, but there are extremely specific guidelines for each mission you have to follow. If this were an open world, I should be able to kill the people, howeverr I want and this simply isn't true.   In short, a friend bought this game for me for Christmas and I am so very glad I didn't spend money on it, it's a waste of time and money. I feel bad my friend wasted money on this title. The developers had a real award winning idea here and they just wasted it with lazy design and production.
679	Cannot recommend this game. Nothing fun here for me.
680	I'm christian.
681	At first I wasn't sure if I would like this game. I had many problems (finishing quest before starting causing the quest to get stuck, and getting stuck in numerous walls) but I went with it (not gonna lie, those pantie physics made me want to keep playing).  As the game went on I started liking it more and more- Until the last level. (spoilers) I chose the puzzle instead of actionâ¦ it made me so mad. Trying to kill the priest I was aiming for the chandelier but I ended up getting âcaught.â So? He knows Iâm trying to kill him, why would it matter if I get caught? Then I realized I was supposed to use the fire to get him. Dang priest ran out so fast I donât even know how many times I had to restart because I ran out of time. Then, after that, when getting the father, I encountered a problem where after he was knocked down I was stuck. After messing around with various powers it eventually popped me to where I needed to be and I completed the game. Itâs not an overall bad game. I thought the game was enjoyable, but there are some things that can really make you angery- things that should have been fixed. As for recommending- it's a tie.
682	I killed my whole family threw this game   7/10  And I pick killing my family every â¥â¥â¥â¥ing time
683	This game rules man
684	it's very fun and inventive, but needs more detail so you know what to do exactly.
685	I cant even walk at the start of the game I try to walk using wasd and nothing happens the controls are horrid for me Im sure this is a problem for me only but I have no clue how to fix it
686	Super fun. Really cool that ypu get to play as a demon child. A little hard to find your way around the manor though. 9/10.
687	this game is wicked
688	I love the premise behind this game, and I was excited to play as a serial killer. But I can't seem to figure out a way to play this game that isnt low low graphics settings or normal graphics with very laggy gameplay.
689	Absolutely wonderful game. Full of Challenges, Both strategic and mental. Awesome graphics and game play. 10/10!
690	i â¥â¥â¥â¥ing love this game JOVITA DE LA COVITA MACITA!
691	Lucius is a simple and completely linear game about killing people for the glory of Satan. As the son of Satan you are giving cool powers, but can use them only when the game wants you to. In fact, only when the game wants you to do something you can actually do something, unless its doing chores as a sidequest. This is the game in a nutshell...  Most people insist this game is a puzzle game and that should make up for its linear play and restrictions, I completely disagree: to kill your target you are almost spoonfed how you need to kill someone (no thinking required wih all the hints). The 'puzzling' consists of searching for items in a big mansion where they are just waiting to be picked up, just very hard to find as most are very small, and adding these items in a very, very specific order to get to the next stage of the kill. I didn't feel like I was carefully planning a murder for Satan thinking hard how to do it, I just felt like I was fighting the game to make it process. This game tested my patience a lot more then my intelligence. This linear play also takes away any replayability and can be completed in about 4 hours (yet an achievement wants you to play it for 40 hours).  All of this makes it a linear satanic point and click Hitman game with a pinch of walking simulator where you spend most of the time searching for items. Only buy when the game is very cheap or you are an actual satanist (machosist is fine too).
692	Overall, I enjoyed Lucius and the funny moments that arose when I played it. I thoroughly enjoyed the cutscenes that roll after each kill. It did glitch (cutscene wouldn't activate) for me in the last chapter, but other then that my gameplay experience was smooth sailing. If you're not a fan of games with linear and restricting gameplay then this isn't the game for you. Most of your time is spent looking for items to kill your target with. Also, unlike Hitman which i've seen this game compared to there is only one way to kill each target. The puzzles for the most part are pretty straight forward, and not much of a challenge. After the first couple of kills it gets a little repetitive. Nonetheless, I enjoyed my time in the world of Lucius, and do not regret my purchase. If this game is on sale I would highly recommend picking it up.
693	Honestly played it for 30 minutes before stopping for good. I really wanted to like this game and I was excited to get it. The trailer was really well done and sold me. Unfortunately, the graphics are poor, the acting is poor, the script is poor, the programming is poor, even the layout of the mansion is poor. It didn't take long for this game to convince me that I was not going to enjoy muddling through it.
694	This game was great. I really enjoyed playing the evil, vindictive little brat.   Pros: -Art was great. It felt natural some how, and yet eerie. -Good story. There were times the plot was quite obvious and other times I was a little surprised, which is hard for stories to do lately. -Even I got scared sometimes.  -I thought the thought put into the exploration of the house was great.  Cons: -Some of the characters were quite flat. -I would have liked more interaction with the devil. -The ways in which you go about destroying your enemies were all planned out. Left little room for planning the demise of your enemies yourself.  Get this game. And be the bad guy!
695	Game runs smooth and its good af!!!
696	Creepy child of Satan on a quest to murder his family. Heck yes. Tiny bit repetitive, but an overall easy play.  Death sequences are hilarious.  Still working to get the 20hr and 40hr achievements. You can beat the game in under 10 hours easy. I can only play through so many times, gaiz. :&lt;
697	This is a fantastic game if have ever laughed at any of the death scense from Omen or thought that the first Exorstist movie was funny for trying to be scary.
698	game is sweet has its frustrating moments but still awesome
699	So much death, t'is good
700	Bring on Lucius 2!!
701	This game is so good . It's time to kill.
702	so in lucius you are the son of saton and you get all these really cool powers such as telekenesis and really cool things like that and the point of the game is that you attempt to kill everyone in the house and the game is the best. My favourite part in personel is the ending when you take control of your father and make him pick up a drill and drill right through your mums head
703	this is a sort of game you need to think outside the box, this is a massive puzzle game. you could get stuck on certian parts but when you figure it out you will have a bundle of fun being a demon child killing people for your deviel farhter
704	Great
705	this was a great game, some parts were a little challenging but thats what makes it fun, it also has a great story
706	Killing people as 6 year old, how can you go wrong? Open world-ish gameplay and inventive deaths makes it a good game however it's a little let down with poor directions and very little hints. Some areas will have you wandering around for ages looking for a clue when it turns out to be a tiny marker on the ground which you need to be 1ft away from. Overall a good game, storyline feels rushed but for the morbidly curious this ticks a lot of boxes.
707	Im not into horror games usually but this game I found really fun and I would recommend getting it.
708	Lucius was honestly one of the best games I've ever played. Granted, at times, it felt like an adventure game with a set path, but the satisfaction of independently finding out how to brutally maim someone while making it look like an accident is something no other game can match. There are a few bugs and glitches here and there, such as me spawning outside of the bedroom at the start of Chapter 4 and being able to walk freely outside the mansion, but it was fixed by me reloading the chapter. This game is worth it. There is a certain charm about being the son of the devil that just hooks me. 
709	Lucius!Idon't think that is a Horror game at all,because is not scary;I think is a half adventure and half puzzle game,in fact you have to find ways to kill every member of your family with various infernal powers and objects,that sometimes are easy to find,sometimes not.  This game reminds the 'Omen' movies that are a must to watch if you like horror movies with satanic characters.  I played 10.5 hours to end the story with a bit of exploration and to complete all the second quests and,finally,I think that Lucius is a very good game to play,but not spend 20â¬(yes,I'm Italian :D ) to buy this game!Wait for some sales,like I did!  Thanks for the attention!Bye ;)
710	I got this game for some two dollars or so. And I must say, what more could a man want from a game to be the six year old son of the devil, riding around on a trike in his mansion, while murdering everyone inside it.   Although taking out the trash is the hardest part of the game.
711	It was a nice game.  The story didn't take too long and it was somehow a creative feeling killing all these people. I can absolutely recommend it when you wanna have a shot but nice experience! Some passages were a little bit annoying though.
712	Very good game, very fun ! Only downside is that it is way too short. Was able to get all achievements except 2 before the end of my first playthrough.   Still, highly recommended, buy it !  Note that the game is averaging 5-7 hours in length. My gametime reflects time spent on 2 achievements that require 20 and 40 hours of being in-game.
713	Lucius is a guilty pleasure. Thereâs just something perversely satisfying about planning and committing murders under the guise of an innocent child for the sake of malice. The story is a bit predictable and sometimes implausible, even in a supernatural context, but its shortcomings pale in comparison to the thrill of getting away unpunished with serial killing and the supernatural powers acquired throughout are a lot of fun. Itâs so good to be bad.
714	This game... I don't know where to start. The bad storyline. Uh... the lip sync that makes old japanese anime look on time. The only thing this game is good for is the unintentional comedic value. Yet I've played it through three times. Save yourself. Save your wallet. Kill me.
715	It was ok, but I got bored after a bit, no challenge
716	Creative, fun and brings out the devil inside you. What else can anyone want in a game!!! 7.5/10
717	This game is by far the best game i ever played and i an supper exsited to play the 2nd one!
718	Destroyed by it's lack of a save function.  I love to spend time exploring. I don't love having to go over and over and over the same ground re-collecting items and repeating the same conversations just because the Devs are either too inept to program a save routine or think that it will make the game seem to be longer than it is.  Shame, because otherwise it was good fun.
719	Ahhhh... Lucius, Lucius, Lucius. What a great game, with a great concept. Killing people as LITERALLY the spawn of Satan. Alright into a list of pros and cons of the game.  Pros: -Great great concept of the game.  -Great character.  -Interesting ways of killing people.  -Loved the consistency throughout playing it.  Cons:  -There were a few bugs that I noticed. To list some: Falling out of the map, biking outside of the house, and... TELEPORTING PRIESTS.  -Final 'boss' battle, was too simple, but required the thinking to pull it off quickly. -I felt bad for some of the people I killed (LOLNOPE)  Overall an 8.5/10 game. Would run around burning people and biking over the dead bodies again.
720	Fun game just to sit back with and find the way that someone has to be killed, my only complaint would be that it is exremely restriced in the ways you are allowed to kill. Everyone has a way they have to die and you can't kill them any other way then that pre-determined way or you get a game over.
721	Well this is kinda unique advanture game where you become.... well, murderous antichrist. The game has 2 main flaws - there is only one way to perform current murder - so you need just to solve the puzzle - no room for artistic creativity :P - game has bugs... sometimes 'cut scenes' will not play as they should and you need to restart chepter to fix that... sometimes it's hard to figure out that is the case. It happened to me 4 times during playing so be aware  But the story, the way it is tolled, the idea and the idea makes those flows not really big. I have big hopes for Lucius 2 :D  Overall 8/10
722	Lucius is a fantastic concept but it does fall short of the promise of it's early trailers. Playing any game as the antagonist, let alone the antichrist, is a tough balance to pull off as we need to be drawn into the character despite their actions. Unfortunately the gameplay is so linear with no real choice over who dies/how we are entirely alienated from the main character and their motivations. They are a silent cipher unquestioningly carrying out commands. Whilst this is not dissimilar to many point and clicks, guybrush threepwood had a personality that carried you through.  There are other good factors about lucius such as clear intentioned level design and a dark humour that has great potential. These are not on their own redemptive enough and I would reccomend that you buy this game only in a sale or otherwise skip on to lucius 2.
723	Makes me enjoy murdering innocent people.  10/10 would murder again.
724	WORST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED.   Game does not provide any hints of how to kill your victims. A lot of it seems poorly written, especially the reasons as to why Lucius is murdering some of them.   This game was boring, there is not a lot to it thart makes the gameplay fun. The 'boss fights' are the most type of oss fights I have ever played on a game. I managed to complete the game hoping for a good ending but it was cheesy and lacked any real depth. This game had huge potenial but it wasn't delivered wel at all.   I wouldn't recommend buying this game.
725	So very interesting but buggy. You play as the Antichrist, a kid who murders everyone. It is dark and gruesome but the graphics are not amazing so the gross parts are not too bad. It's buggy as well and hard. I could not beat it without watching play throughs. All that being said it's still a super cool game pick it up at 50% off.
726	got a tricycle. rode through a wall. got out from the manor. so happy. much free, very freedom. wow. rode till there's no road. fell off. forever falling. halp?  haz porn. 10/10
727	i recommend to you this game only if you love to kill people or bobes!!
728	its was a nice game :)
729	This is an incomplete, broken game, dont wate your time or your money buying this crap. The gameplay is terrible, the animation looks made by a five year old, the game has numerous issues. Wont be buying part two or anyhting from this developer ever again, and neither should you.
730	The theme is good over all, solid voice work and great story however...  The controls on your powers are dodgey at best and if you're stuck then look up a guide because some of the things this game expects you to do and figure out are crazy and flatout unreasonable at times.   I recommend it, but only if you play with a walkthrough next to you and during the last chapter if you choose the right option and beat the game lemme know because I spent 2 hours on that encounter and had to switch to the left one to beat the game finally.
731	Don't mess up with children. (Sorry for my broken english)
732	Abnormal game... so dizzy during playing. However it is a good game with logical mission.
733	Cool Game
734	Best game ever 10/10.  And this was the most usefull review in the history of reviews.
735	This games so creepy :v
736	its a â¥â¥â¥â¥in twisted evil minded â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up child game     i luv it
737	Fun game. It's nice to be the creepy little kid and not running from him for a change.
738	Hey, any game that allows me to telepathically influence my father into killing my mother with a nail gun is a must play!  Right guys? Anyone..? No? Well if you are not a fan of the above mentioned you can ride your trike for hours! :D
739	Top tier lip synching
740	Pros  Fun game Good youtube content Fun kills BYCICLES CONS Linear story not very creative gets a bit repetive  0 replayablity
741	A little bit buggy and laggy, but I don't have a great PC. On the lower settings it helps this. Overall one of the more fun games I've played. Fun, great story, good mechanics. Awesome game overall.
742	-saw mom trying to walk thru a closed door -got stuck on the floor like if i was swimming in it -sneaked past mom while making all the noises in the world -got stuck in a level because the detective decided to see me because I was 1cm left to the spot i should be (what?) -had to take the garbage out but lost it in the middle of the living room, during day time, because the room was too dark (even tho if you look from outside, it's quite bright inside). -killed someone instantly with rat poison, even tho that stuff takes it's time to actually kill someone (right?)  i don't even know anymore
743	I got this game for some two dollars or so. And I must say, what more could a man want from a game to be the six year old son of the devil, riding around on a trike in his mansion, while murdering everyone inside it.   Although taking out the trash is the hardest part of the game.
744	Lucius has a very interesting concept behind it. The idea of playing the monster that is murdering people without others finding out about it is very brutal but a cool idea. However, this game has multiple problems with controls and communication. This causes simple puzzles to be both difficult to figure out and difficult to execute once you know the solution.   Overall, I would NOT recommend Lucius, but I support the ideas behind it and look forward to another game like it that has better puzzle and control design.
745	It was a nice game.  The story didn't take too long and it was somehow a creative feeling killing all these people. I can absolutely recommend it when you wanna have a shot but nice experience! Some passages were a little bit annoying though.
746	Lucius is a game very heavily based on the movie 'The Omen'. It's a great game that places you in the role of the devil's child Lucius. Despite it looking like a horror game, it is not really scary since you are the threat that's killing people on the go. You get a big mansion with a lot of staff in which you will kill them one by one in seperate chapters.  Overall the game feels like a puzzle game, and a pretty tough game at that. I really enjoyed playing it. I'm just going to list some positives and negatives below:  YES Great idea for a game Big location Gruesome deaths A lot of backstory on most characters Awesome demonic powers So much death!  NO A lot of bugs and glitches Controls make you feel like you are driving a tank instead of controlling a 6-year old Bad voice acting for some characters Not scary Very linear  Despite the games awesomeness, there are a lot of bugs and glitches. In the second chapter, the mom kept walking into the door leasing outside, despite it being locked. Also, the telekineses power is very hard to use most of the time. There have also been a couple of instances in which I hard to start a chapter again because people would not die when they were supposed to, or stayed put when they were supposed to wak out of the room.   Despite all of this, Lucius is an awesome little game that puts you in the bad guy's shoes. A part 2 is on its way, so let's hope the developers have learned from their mistakes and will release an awesome sequal!
747	OH GOD ITS SO EVIL. Yet somehow... I really liked it. I woudln't reccomend this game for people who don't like solving pretty complex and non-obvious puzzles (sometimes they were really out of sight), but its interesting to solve and watch the death cutscenes. Didn't like the repetetive things that the game characters said but it's not really too bad. Some minor glitches in the game but overall decent! I'd reccoment this game to anyone who enjoys murder mysteries, puzzles and a good story. 7/10
748	The lag in this game needs to be fixed
749	if you like running around like an idiot not knowing what to do next and having to go check a guide on youtube well this game is for you!!!! feel like home!!!!
750	Woke up, rode my trike into the garage, doused my mechanic in gasoline, and set that n-word on fire.
751	Creepy T_T
752	I Killed My Parents =)   10/10 Lovely Game
753	Pick this up on sale if it is marked down. I got a good 7 hours playtime out of, but I ended up resorting to using walkthroughs on a few spots I got stuck on. The controls at times can be frustrating, especially the levitation. You have to murder people in a very narrowly defined path and it can be very difficult in some parts to figure out what to do. I did still enjoy the game however, even with these flaws but would not recommend it at full price.
754	I didn't find the game to be that interesting or intuitive. There's no motivation from the main character to bring about the horrific deaths of other people in the house except 'Satan appeared in my room one night and told me that if I murder people I get more psychic, I am totally okay with this.' Like, okay, sure. I'll fumble around with no hints and kill people I have no/minor grudges against, sounds great.
755	:}
756	I rate it 9/11 its a solid game some glitches here and there and crashes but putting that aside, Got it for free, Gave it a try and it was pretty interesting, I mean if you want a short game thats pretty wack and some what fun its a game to get.
757	To be brief, the game is very linear and there may be little re-play value in it. That being said, the game is quite enjoyable. The kid is a little devil, and it's great setting up the deaths and watching them play out. The puzzles do feel a bit easy, and there are a few glitches, but those are quite minor - the game is definitely worth checking out.
758	Absoutly Stunning Creative Ways to kill people.
759	great and cinical game, fun. i liked it
760	WORST GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED.   Game does not provide any hints of how to kill your victims. A lot of it seems poorly written, especially the reasons as to why Lucius is murdering some of them.   This game was boring, there is not a lot to it thart makes the gameplay fun. The 'boss fights' are the most type of oss fights I have ever played on a game. I managed to complete the game hoping for a good ending but it was cheesy and lacked any real depth. This game had huge potenial but it wasn't delivered wel at all.   I wouldn't recommend buying this game.
761	To be honest I didn't expect much from this game, but I was pleasantly surprised! The graphics, gameplay, BGM and voice acting is average (the voice actress for Lucius's mum was pretty good though!), however the concept of playing the Antichrist made this a very entertaining experience.  Imagine this game as a horror movie, it would be very scary and suspenseful with all the mysterious unexplained deaths. However, playing as Lucius it was up to me to make these deaths happen and not be caught in the process.   Grab this game when it's on sale!
762	Such a great game
763	maybe toptenreviews should add like top 10 ways to dead
764	i love this game but hard to control at first
765	Lacking gaming objectives, spent hours finding how to continue the game.
766	It's a horror game where you play as the horror, and I've been wanting that for ages. Games where you play as the villain always intrigue me, and this game embraces the concept. Throughout the entire thing you're either plotting your next evil deed, enjoying the result of your work, or just using your hellish powers for giggles.  The game feels like a horror movie all the way through. You got a narrator talking about your progress, cutscenes to give the story more depth, and an impressive climax. The voice acting is decent; it ranged from superb to not so bad as to ruin the immersion. The characters are actually intriguing for the little time you know them and I almost felt sorry for some of the poor victims.   The whole puzzle theme of the game is intriguing since it forces you to think a lot. Sometimes you might get stuck for hours because you can't figure out you need that tiny thing in that room and put it in the other thing. But the cutscenes at the end of each chapter are rewarding and satisfying enough to make the frustration worth it.  The set of powers you get to wield with your character are also fun to use. I would have preferred some more freedom to fully enjoy your awesome powers of Antichrist, but as it is, the game takes great advantage of what it gives you. Especially in the climax, where you truly feel like a demonic badass with the help of great surroundings and an epic soundtrack. That too should be mentioned; the music in this game is really good.  If I were to point out flaws, I'd say that I did encounter a few bugs. Nothing so big that it damaged my experience, though. The characters' talking did get old really quickly as well. Especially the final boss, who has ONE LINE that he repeats the entire time.   To conclude, Lucius is the perfect game for the sadistic player who wants to feel like a villain and also enjoys puzzle games. The experience is enhanched by beautiful graphics for an indie game, great soundtrack and an interesting story.
767	There is a bike in the game :)
768	I love this game so much due to the fact that I'm playing as the son of the Devil. I'm going to just dive right in by saying that I haven't even completed the game yet but I felt like it deserved a nice review! So, the main goal of the game is to give your father souls. To do this you must kill your family, people who work for your family and your families friends. Pretty funny right? No. You literally give some pretty gruesome deaths to people for no reason whatsoever! I love it! You have cool powers like Telekinesis, Mind Control and more! This game focuses on following a plot [kinda] which is why you can't just kill people randomly, and you can only kill people with certain moves or objects.   Lucius 2 is the game for you if you feel like literally killing everyone who crosses your path. It's just rooms of people that you are allowed to kill - constantly. 
769	yes its nice game
770	well it seems fun but u can use your powers like you want to. also theres this one mission that is really annoying and seems like is completely random and impossible. after trying it about 30 times and failing at the same exact point i gave up and uninstalled the game
771	I do not recommend buying this game at full price - I got it for 2 dollars though, and if that is still the price when you see it, then by all means, drop two bucks. That being said, this game is a mess.  I like the idea - I REALLY like the idea - but the execution is mediocre at best. Run around a mansion as a 7 year old and murder everyone in various ways. Sounds like a blast! I didn't even care that it was all scripted, and that there was little to no creativity allowed. What I cared about was the wacky bugs and confusing as hell missions. I had to look at the wiki in order to figure out what to do in the last half of the game, and I regularly play the Sherlock Holmes games, so I'm no stranger to adventure/puzzle games. But there is very little guiding your way. An intial mark on the map shows you your target, but after that, nothing. No markers showing important objects or following your target or anything. You can get a couple 'gifts' that give you hints, but unfortunately my game bugged out and failed to register my 'chores' so I couldn't get past the Ouiji board (which only hints at an important item to obtain, not what to do). Need to kill one of the maids? Clearly the thing to do is...break the washing machine by dropping an iron into it, thus making her...take a shower? Of course! Need to kill the driver? Well break that washing machine with the iron again to lure out the mechanic (because to hell with washing clothes!), then...find a mix tape so he can turn around and listen to it, allowing you to get some paint thinner and a rag to knock him out with? Masterful! There are also plenty of zero purpose items in the game. Books and bottles can be picked up, but serve no purpose. You can't even throw them to distract NPCs away from locations. Light switches can be flicked on and off, leading one to believe that there is a 'stealth' aspect of the game Nope...in the one section where you can do it, darkness has no meaning - mom will find you whether you are standing in pitch black or right under the light bulb. There is a section of stealth gameplay later in the game where darkness actually matters...but you take out the power to the mansion, thus rendering the switches useless anyway!  The powers are cool, but you rarely get to use them. Telekenesis is your go to, followed by mind control. You can mind control a few of the people in the mansion, but unless they have some scripted interaction in that particular 'chapter', you can't do anything with them. Later in the game, you get some offensive spells...but unless you choose the 'Action' ending (oh yes, that is a thing), you will use the fireball spell twice and the combustion spell - your last spell, btw - once. Yep, one time. The only truly useful spell that doesn't require a scripted event is memory erase, where if you are caught doing something, you can make them forget (but only 6 times a chapter).   And don't even get me started on the bugs. I have witnessed: an NPC walking into a closed door, effectively locking it for me. A chore not registering as complete (taking out the garbage), thus failing to allow me to continue that line of 'side quests'. Dropping that iron into the washer didn't work a few times. Dropping a hair dryer into a tub didn't work because it got stuck behind it, and was out of 'range' of telekenesis. Entries in my journal not registering, leaving me with zero clues on how to continue. And many more minor annoyances (glitching through walls, glitching through each other, falling through the floor once, getting stuck in the courtyard on a very small 'hill'). The voice sync is awful, the voice acting is...not terrible, but not good either. If what they do with their faces could be called 'expressions' or 'emotions' then those are awful too. Many of these could of probably been fixed, but clearly the developer did not see a reason to.   Overall, the game is a mess, but it is certainly worth the two dollars I paid for it. I love the idea, and I would like to see more from the developer (although I'm told the sequel to this is even worse), but please polish it up, give a bit more creativity, and let us use our damn spells! If there isn't a sale on, avoid this one. If there is, anywhere from 1 to 5 bucks...go ahead and give it a whirl.
772	I'm playing this, because it's an adventure game. But I've never played a game so full of bugs. Clipping issues, falling through the floor constantly in one climactic scene, etc. I'm honestly surprised they came out with a sequel considering they haven't even worked the bugs out of the first one yet.  The concept is ok and while it's working properly it's pretty fun, but when it isn't you want to have an exorcism performed on your PC.  However, there isn't much actual story. You get assigned someone to kill, you kill them (and have exactly one way to do so), and then it fades to black and the next 'mission' starts. I was really expecting more of a sandbox.   If you are patient with bugs and like the idea of basically being the kid from the Omen, then this could be recommended. For everyone else, spend your money on a telltale game or something.
773	just completed this in 5 hours. was really good but found it easy to get stuck which meant reloading a save which is a bit annoying having to do everything again. finale was a bit annoying gameplay wise (you'll see what i mean when you play it), however it had a decent story line (if a little predictable at times). overall enjoyable game, even better that i picked it up for Â£1.50 in a sale
774	So much reverb.  Best played muted while listening to a horror soundtrack playlist on youtube.
775	Game runs smooth and its good af!!!
776	its a â¥â¥â¥â¥in twisted evil minded â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up child game     i luv it
777	I have enjoyed this game so far and i'm glad I bought it, but I probably only bought it because it's on sale, but either way this game is a good horror game in my opinion.
778	An interesting game concept but it gets frustrating and tiresome at times. It's definitely something I would recommend, but only on sale.
779	now im i want to â¥â¥â¥â¥ susan THX :D
780	Can't kill someone with a nail gun, 4/20
781	I would recommend playing this game, it's very good in my taste! I loved the main character plain and simple, the graphics were good, and there were plenty of neat ways to kill people. One of the bad things is, any kind of hint the game supplied such as the notes in your notebook weren't that helpful about 30% of the time in my experience. There were also more than enough bugs/glitches to even count, which most of the time ended in a game over or just simply resetting the level and doing all of that stuff you FINALLY accomplished all over again. But my main pet peeve about this game was that the telekinesis power was EXTREMELY hard to use. Things would go off into random directions or the item itself that you were trying to move will just be stuck in its place.  Other than physical game problems (bugs, glitches, mechanics, etc) both endings were just terrible. I appreciated the alternate ending feature, but both endings consisted of almost the exact same gameplay content at a ridiculously difficult level lol. Worst part about it, there was only a slight difference in the ending cinematics. Both endings in general were not creative at all. When I played the first, it was 3/10. The second one I'd give maybe a 5/10. Although my review sounds more negative than positive, I do like this game and rate it above average; my critique in endings of anything is always picky anyways lmao. But over all, the story and characters intrigued me the most, so I'd give it a solid 8/10, probably would play again! :^)
782	I would recommend this game,though somewhat reluctantly,because of it's very linear gameplay and 2 annoying stealth missions. Still,the premise is original,imo, it succeeds in mantaining the creepy horror atmosphere and playing a game where good guys don't have to win in the end is refreshing (Though it was amusing to watch Lucious getting successfully exorcised.'Hallelujah!') .  Worth buying , when on sale with a big discount. Oh and it probably won't take you more than 7 hours to complete it,so there's that too.
783	Nice Horror Puzzle Game Love It
784	Creepy child of Satan on a quest to murder his family. Heck yes. Tiny bit repetitive, but an overall easy play.  Death sequences are hilarious.  Still working to get the 20hr and 40hr achievements. You can beat the game in under 10 hours easy. I can only play through so many times, gaiz. :&lt;
785	It was a little entertaining, though the en was very quick and wasn't very wellmade
786	Lucius is a simple and completely linear game about killing people for the glory of Satan. As the son of Satan you are giving cool powers, but can use them only when the game wants you to. In fact, only when the game wants you to do something you can actually do something, unless its doing chores as a sidequest. This is the game in a nutshell...  Most people insist this game is a puzzle game and that should make up for its linear play and restrictions, I completely disagree: to kill your target you are almost spoonfed how you need to kill someone (no thinking required wih all the hints). The 'puzzling' consists of searching for items in a big mansion where they are just waiting to be picked up, just very hard to find as most are very small, and adding these items in a very, very specific order to get to the next stage of the kill. I didn't feel like I was carefully planning a murder for Satan thinking hard how to do it, I just felt like I was fighting the game to make it process. This game tested my patience a lot more then my intelligence. This linear play also takes away any replayability and can be completed in about 4 hours (yet an achievement wants you to play it for 40 hours).  All of this makes it a linear satanic point and click Hitman game with a pinch of walking simulator where you spend most of the time searching for items. Only buy when the game is very cheap or you are an actual satanist (machosist is fine too).
787	Lucius is one of those games that tries to present itself as new and unique, but it's really just a point-and-click adventure game delivered in a 'horror' RPG package. There are some parts of this game that try too hard to be edgy or shocking, such as the couple (unnecessary) sequences of low-censored nudity and sex.  Chapter after chapter is just a simple 'Use item X with location Y until Success' puzzle. Most of these are adequately explained or hinted at, but you will have one or two that are so ridiculous and make no sense that using a walkthrough is almost a requirement. Occasionally you will have a time restraint, but these chapters are rare. Each chapter details an individual murder of someone living/working in your mansion, usually by some bizarre and unnecessarily complicated chain of events (well, the difficulty has to increase somehow).  This game is technically 'open world', with the player having access to the entire mansion soon after the first several chapters. Regardless of where you go, each murder has to take place in the same location with the same objects, and it is typically set up that you don't need to wander too far to find key pieces of the murder.  Lucius is a puzzle game for those who like a little bit of a challenge, or for those that harbor an unsafe anger for childhood authority figures.
788	its a very fun game and stuff but i didnt really like it so you should get it!!
789	Great. The game doesn't allow me to go into windowed mode or even get to actually play this. Spend your money on something else. It isn't worth it in my opinion.
790	this game sucks it is so hard and borring at some parts!
791	WTG(((WOW THIS GAME))) This is very nice horror story game. The story is very good. This game is about this boy have black magic to kill the people areound him. The Lucifer is a bad guy of this game not Lucius. The Lucifer controll him to kill people. All of this,This game is the best of horror story game!!!!! BUT Outlast is the really best Horror game. :) I didn't make it end yet,But soon. :)  Graphic:2/3 Story:5/5 Character:1/2 Total Score:8/10
792	TL;DR: This game is honestly not that great. Took me 5 hours today to do the game entirely, including all the time I spent just running around the house trying to figure out what I'm supposed to do, which counts for most of it. For 20$, I would have expected more.  Full review:  Lucius isn't entirely bad, but it is far from great, and far from justifying the 20$ price.  You start the game having only 1 power, which is telekinesis. There are a lot of items in the game that you can move and swing around, which is great, but there are two down sides to this: first, you are suspicious because of items floating in the air, while you are just standing there (but turning those crosses upside-down isn't). Second, it's pointless. You can move vases, cups, glasses, etc but it serves no purpose whatsoever.  Second power you get is Mind Control, which is honestly not as great as it sounds. Just about everyone will be 'too strong' to be affected, so the use that they say about 'mind controlling them so you can do what you want'... not so much. The only ones that can be affected are the people you need to kill, but only under some circumstances.  Third is mind erase. Basically, if you get caught, you can wipe the person's memory, but once again, only in some circumstances. Caught at night walking around? Nope. Pretty much the only time it can be used is if you are caught swinging cups with your mind.  Final power is an incinerate power. Sounds cool, yet again, just like the previous 2 powers, can only be used in some situations. In fact, I think there is only 2-3 of those, maybe 4. Not much.  Aside from the powers, there are a lot of things that are lacking. I'm all up for a hard game, but at some point, give us some clues. One of the person to kill is the person taking care of the laundry (yes, that is ALL she does, for a family of 5 plus the workers). Only info you get is 'She takes care of the laundry'. That's it. You need to kill her in a way that won't incriminate you by only knowing she does the laundry (spoiler following) to in the end kill her in her bath.  A lot of thing happens, or are said, that either doesn't make sense, or the characters are jumping to conclusion too fast. The more you advance in the game, the more those things are obvious. And yes, the following contains spoilers.  ---  At first, there is a few things that bothers me, but it really starts with a confession from a cop to a priest:  Cop: I've been having nightmares, terrible scenes playing in my head. And this family are the players. Priest: It sounds to be like this family needs help, my son. Priest: It sounds to me like the church should intervene.  That is the exact text. What do they do? They try to contact the family to support them morally. Although it is 'helping the family, that is not an 'intervention'.   Second, there is actually a scene where you are sleeping with your shoes on, and you get woken up by your grand-father that punches you in the balls. And no reaction about this last part, obviously. About the shoes, all the other nights you sleep with your slippers on.  Third, you are told by your grandfather that your father and uncle never found the hidden door in the basement while playing there as kids... Really? They played there for years, in a room about 5m by 5m (max), with one of the walls being nothing more than a curtain and they never wondered what was on the other side? They never even noticed it?  Fourth, a journalist that was unconscious, wakes up to you throwing a fireball at him. His first though? It is the reversed crosses on the walls that gives you your powers! Forget trying to run away from the 7 years old, fireball throwing kid here, let's instead try to put back those crosses in the right way.  Fifth, your 'father' finds a book about satan on your grandfather's desk. First conclusion? Your grandfather used a ritual to curse your family, and you are the source of that curse! Don't think that the grandfather, which was already sounding partially senile, could just have been weirder, or that all this is just stupid, noooo... 'It's the only logical explanation!' (actual quote from the father)  Those are only some of the points that I find illogical. There are many more.  ---  As for the achievements... Most fit in one of two category: 'play the game' or 'do useless stuff to get this'. Examples:  Play 20/40 hours. With a 5 hours game, yes it will be hard, but not for the good reasons. Break X objects. Doesn't have any purpose, but you can get it! Get caught X times. Be rewarded for failing! Kill X persons. Basically, one per person that you NEED to kill. So 20 achievements right there Run 26 miles. Yes I did get it. That's how much running in circle you do. Take 20 pictures. You only need to take one in the game, but if you click 19 more times...  Finally, you would expect a horror game (or at least a game about satan and the antichrist) to have a dark atmosphere. Well, the only thing really dark about the game is the corridors, lacking lightning. All the murders are so cliche and msot are so predictable that the atmosphere it's trying to create just doesn't work.  In conclusion, if the game was between 5-10$, it would be acceptable. But 20$ for less than 5 hours of gameplay, without replay value and with how the game works, it is not worth it in my opinion.
793	Seems there is a glitch in the game, when sneaking around to get rat poison a door won't highlight to open.  Read one could reset the game and it would be fixed, did this and nothing, another said to use your flashlight on the door then open it, this did not help either. I enjoyed what I got to play of the game.
794	mad at your mom or dad. kill them in this game, also kill your butcher, uncle, maid, maid, mechanic, cop, butler, and more
795	This game was great. I really enjoyed playing the evil, vindictive little brat.   Pros: -Art was great. It felt natural some how, and yet eerie. -Good story. There were times the plot was quite obvious and other times I was a little surprised, which is hard for stories to do lately. -Even I got scared sometimes.  -I thought the thought put into the exploration of the house was great.  Cons: -Some of the characters were quite flat. -I would have liked more interaction with the devil. -The ways in which you go about destroying your enemies were all planned out. Left little room for planning the demise of your enemies yourself.  Get this game. And be the bad guy!
796	It's an alright game, I mean it's kind of old now. If you like doing missions and getting steam cards from a game. This is a game for you. You basically kill people the whole time and do missions for your dad and others.
797	This game manages to: - be overly directive on the fun part (use of powers, who to kill and when) - provide a complete freedom on the boring part (I hope you enjoy looking for an item for hours)  In the end, you are just free to get bored.
798	This game is probably one of my favorite games. The second ones a bit of a disappointment, but this one got me obsessed with Lucius.
799	Honestly played it for 30 minutes before stopping for good. I really wanted to like this game and I was excited to get it. The trailer was really well done and sold me. Unfortunately, the graphics are poor, the acting is poor, the script is poor, the programming is poor, even the layout of the mansion is poor. It didn't take long for this game to convince me that I was not going to enjoy muddling through it.
800	Needs quick saves as i am stuck trying to sneak around in the dark to find my Grandfather . YES , i did it .....nope , i must sneak to get super glue and back . Grrrrrrrr . Overall , it has been fun
801	finished the game it was great experience and good story and gameplay. Environment was also good but some pros on game play. Except that fewer gameplay issues totally worth the money
802	Top tier lip synching
803	good god...what have I done?
804	fun and creepy and funny-ish
805	Fun game. It's nice to be the creepy little kid and not running from him for a change.
806	Great game but is very difficult... at least for me.
807	I would recommend this game,though somewhat reluctantly,because of it's very linear gameplay and 2 annoying stealth missions. Still,the premise is original,imo, it succeeds in mantaining the creepy horror atmosphere and playing a game where good guys don't have to win in the end is refreshing (Though it was amusing to watch Lucious getting successfully exorcised.'Hallelujah!') .  Worth buying , when on sale with a big discount. Oh and it probably won't take you more than 7 hours to complete it,so there's that too.
808	its a good game a really good game but its not for me.
809	This game is messed up beyond anything i have ever played. You play a 7 year old who is the devil's son and you murder people. reminds me of the omen and children of the corn. Good game if you're into gory messed up games.
810	If yo are a satanist and enjoy killing and watching people suffer then this is the game for you!  I beat this in the shortest time possible for me, i was addicted to this games story and now im gonna try the second one
811	Great game 100x better than the 2nd don't even bother with that one!
812	Game has a good idea but unfortunatelly it is too lineer. 
813	Mt bom
814	Fun for a bit. Haven't beaten it, I walked into a wall and couldn't advance.
815	Bit of an overrated game. Nothing special about it, really. It's basically a blatant ripoff of the movie The Omen. Hell, it's played out almost identical. But even if you haven't seen the film, you can tell it's pretty hokey, between the crap voice acting, the rusty gameplay, the maze of a mansion design, the lack of character development, the lack of subtlety regarding Lucius and his father Lucifer (not much of a spoiler), and the lackluster gore moments. I mean I'm a gorehound, but this was pretty boring. There is little to no suspense, the plot is predicable, and the idea of making a killer child is getting tiresome, which doesn't help when you add in the satanic aspect. If you actually want this game, don't bother. EVen if it's on a Steam Sale, the price isn't worth it.
816	wow this game is boring!
817	Great game! Hope 2 is this fun
818	Fun stuff! Just wish there was controller support for it, (don't see it coming anytime soon) but still worth checking out!
819	Short but...   The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire, The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire, The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire, We don't need no water let the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ burn, Burn â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ burn. 
820	Every were that Lucius walks death follows of corse when people start to be murdered no one points to a child. This charming young evil child has captivated my soul hes almost to cute to say no to. his handsome father (the devil) almost makes me want to sell my soul to him. though i dout the devil has ever look so handsome in a game correct me if im wrong. Lucius will make your sick little devil love heart come out this game almost feels like it was made for me. The sick and twisted way that Lucius thinks is almost to much to for my girl hood.   This boy pulls off murders better than most real life adults. This boy is what nightmares are made of.  though i only have nice things to say. i spoiled the game for my self by watching someone play this and the seconed one but there so good &lt;3  
821	Lucius is a very good horror game! Go for it. You will have a great time. :)
822	Super sometimes stealth and sometimes bug :D (BUG TO MAKE IT FASTER)
823	  DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine
824	I beat this game in 7 hours, get most of the achievements in another two.  Sadly, there're two achievements over which you have to wonder: do you want to be a good boy and play this game for 40 hours (without pause) or be a bad boy and use Cheat Engine.  Satan is proud of me.
825	very nice game, but it not horror games, just puzzle and logic games
826	I enjoyed the game a lot, however imo I think that looking for objects was made unnecessary difficult. Overall, it's a great game!
827	...............wow   ....................many victims   .....so funny   ......................................much kills  ..........very bloody  .................such game
828	If you want a game about murdering your family then this game is for you. Its a unique game I suppose although it is very rough. The narrative is good but its not great because you can't turn of subtitles and the voice actors are not that great. The murders are good but sometimes they don't always make sense. Sometimes their straightforward and you have no problems. Other times you can't figure them out and your forced to use a walkthrough. A shame the sequel to this game didn't turn out. This game could really use a re do to make better graphics and more lines of dialogue with better voice actors. Still, its good for 5 hours of fun.
829	You get to saw some guy's head in half. That's the main selling point of the game for me.
830	This is a great game, you can interact with most things. Good texture/quality/graphics and gameplay. Some glitches, havent finished the whole game and it can be difficult since it doesen't give you many leads on what to do or where to find, what to do. It doesen't seem to have a story to be interested in but a small story like this game has is enough since you aren't playing it for the story. Could use more freeroam but where you don't get so lost in the manision. This game is something worth the try!
831	I am Christian, and even I find this game amusing!
832	Fun, interesting, very dark humor that I quite appreciate, but you can't really read the description of this game without expecting dark humor. The puzzle solutions are not quite as clear as they could be in some areas, you might end up on a bit of a search, and I am currently stuck at a stealth portion that is very frustrating. I will go back and beat it at some point though, I would recommend this to any of my friends who like this kind of humor and puzzles.
833	EN I have honestly to say that I was following Lucius from a long time, but at one of the last sales I've been kinda let down by some bad reviews saying that the mansion was huge and you had to find little objects and made it sound like a pixel hunter game. Last monday I bought it tho, since it was very very cheap (less than 1â¬) and I saw that all the bad reviews were pretty wrong. Sure the mansion isn't small, but let me tell you that if you're a 'game explorer' like me and love to go in every single place in games like Fallout 3 or Skyrim well this map will be a piece of cake and you'll learn it pretty fast. About the gameplay itself, yes there's no much freedom but it's kinda explained with the fact that the kills must look like accidents, but the puzzles ('cause after all it's a big puzzle game from a point of view, where you have to find out how to kill someone step by step) are never frustrating or absurds like in some point &amp; click adventures. If I should point a flaw it'd be about the stealth sections 'cause more than real stealth they're just a series of trial and error until you learn the patterns of the NPCs, so while I understand the willing to vary the gameplay they've been implemented poorly unfortunately. So to wrap it up I'd suggest this game 'cause it's pretty good and entertaining, dunno honestly if at the full price it's back again (18.99â¬ here), 'cause while fun it's pretty short (about 6-7hrs, taking my time to explore, achievements, etc.) P.s. Yes I cheated my way through the 20/40hrs achievements 'cause there was no way I was gonna leave my PC on just for that, it'd be different if the game would take that time to finish obviously!  IT Devo onestamente dire che stavo seguendo Lucius da un bel di tempo, ma ad una delle utlime svendite alcune recensioni che parlavano di una villa gigante dove dover cercare piccoli oggetti me l'han fatto sembrare un gioco stile 'pixel hunter' e quindi ho desistito. Lo scorso LunedÃ¬ perÃ² l'ho comperato, dato che il buon sconto (meno di 1â¬) ed ho notato che le recensioni negative erano sbagliate. Certo la villa non Ã¨ piccola, ma lasciatevi dire che se vi piace esplorare nei giochi come me ed amate andare in ogni singolo posto in giochi come Fallout 3 o Skyrim beh questa mappa sarÃ  un gioco da ragazzi e l'imparerete velocemente. Riguardo al gameplay in sÃ©, sÃ¬ non c'Ã¨ moltissima libertÃ  ma Ã¨ in parte spiegata dal fatto che le uccisioni devono sembrare incidenti, ma i puzzle (dato che alla fine Ã¨ un grande puzzle game da un certo punto di vista, dove dovete capire come uccidere qualcuno passo passo) non sono mai frustranti od assurde come in alcune avventure punta&amp;clicca.. Se dovessi citare un difetto sarebbero le sezioni stealth perchÃ© piÃ¹ che un vero stealth sono solo una serie di prova e riprova finchÃ© non imparate il percorso dei PNG, quindi anche se capisco l'intenzione di variare il gameplay sono state implementate malamente sfortunatamente. Quindi per concludere suggerirei il gioco perchÃ© Ã¨ buono e divertente, anche se non so onestamente se al prezzo pieno a cui Ã¨ tornato (18.99â¬ qui), perchÃ© anche se divertente Ã¨ abbstanza corto (circa 6-7hrs, prendendomi il tempo di esplorare, obbiettivi, etc.) P.s. SÃ¬ ho imbrogliato per ottenere l'obbiettivo delle 20/40 ore perchÃ© non avevo nessuna intenzione di lasciare il PC acceso solo per quello, sarebbe stato differente se il gioco avesse richiesto quel tempo per essere finito ovviamente!
834	This game is a great small sandbox game, it is not open world, but more of a sandbox. You are in a mansion, and can freely move anywhere, but limited to some places based upon progression; the more you progress, the more areas you can enter. If you are in it for the story, get it. I got this for 1 dollar, and was worth it, as it only took me 4 hours to complete, the levels in between are very short and small, and I would not consider this a puzzle, since it is way too easy. This game is rated A for adults only cause well...kids shouldn't play this =P 8/10 for very short chapters.
835	10/10 would murder everyone dear to me agian.
836	I bought this and Lucius II in a bundle (I haven't played Lucius II yet) for like $1.75 or something.  For the price, I guess it's been okay?  It feels really empty, poorly explained, the video and audio aren't synced at all, and it just seems like the game is trying to keep you busy with simple tasks over and over.  It's like a poorly made Hitman clone, but with only one way to kill each person.  Rating: 2.3 / 10
837	Anti-Christ Simulator 2012   Probably the only simulator game you can find out there with a story.
838	Apart from some glitch encountered with the notebook and chores missions, it's one of the funniest game I've played. Awsome achievements!

840	Screw this game. Seriously, screw this game. Its twisted, vile, and EVILLLLLLLLLer than satan himself. Nobody should have the displeasure of playing the game themselves, not even the son of satan, Lucius who the game is named after. Even judging by gameplay, its a boring joke of a game. -1/10
841	Like a more linear Hitman with weaker voice acting and graphics. Avoid.
842	This game is so bad it's good. The voice acting, glitches and mediorce graphics turn a crappy game into a hilarious one. It's so much fun to watch people scream and die while their eyes and mouth barely move. That said, I've had the game freeze and crash a few times and the controls are frustrating.
843	This is a great game, you can interact with most things. Good texture/quality/graphics and gameplay. Some glitches, havent finished the whole game and it can be difficult since it doesen't give you many leads on what to do or where to find, what to do. It doesen't seem to have a story to be interested in but a small story like this game has is enough since you aren't playing it for the story. Could use more freeroam but where you don't get so lost in the manision. This game is something worth the try!
844	This game is so buggy. So slow, it's only 16-18 FPS when the gameplay start but it goes 60 FPS when the movie play, We don't watch the movie dude, we want to play!!!
845	This my own likes and dislikes of the game  Likes &gt;Graphics Is great for old game &gt;Good Storyline &amp; Scenes &gt;Get to play as Villian which is rare in games &gt;Alot of Interaction &gt;After few unlocks be able to explore alot the house  Dislikes &gt;NPCS can get stuck &gt;NPCS detecting you can seem almost impossible to avoid   Is the game worth buying? I quite impressed with this game and sure is worth the buy in my opinion
846	That moment when u do the tour of the house,to find the victim ! 69/10
847	Watched Pewds play it.  I thought I was womanly enough to play it myself.  I. Can't. Play. This. Without. Someone. Besides me.  Overall a great story-based killing game. Role reversal is always fun. Instead of being the Hero, you're the bloody murderer. A 6 year-old professional killer.
848	Plain tedious.
849	great game //
850	A fun little game that I finished in (more or less) one 6-hour sitting. This game has as much jank as it has charm, and while being very linier, the puzzles are mostly stright forward (I resorted to a guide 2-3 times for specific moments, usually when there was a very specific spot you needed to interact with) and the murder animations are incredibly brutal, for the most part.  The stealth sections are garbage, as are the 'fight' sections, but these are both in the minority. Acheivements are dolled out fairly generously to begin with, but there is a 40-hour playtime acheivement which, as I already mentioned I finished the game in 6, will require me to leave the game running on its own for quite some time.  All in all, I recommend this game because it was fun and had enough content to keep me occupied and engaged for the entire time, which is more than can be said for titles like Assasin's Creed. Get this game, but get it on a sale, because as enjoyable as it was, it wasn't without its hiccups 'and' was completed in one sitting, so value that how you will.
851	Lucius had a nice idea for those of us who appreciate dark humour what with finding novel ways to kill his family and friends. However, there's not much creativity involved as you have set ways in which to get about your evil ways so the replay value is really low. The controls are clunky which often leads to frustrated mashing of buttons and a complete loss of immersion. Oh, and it doesn't matter if you've already figured out what to do, the game just won't let you do it until you've gone through the entire house looking for Lucius' thought processes so that HE figures out what has to be done.  Oh and the achievements are ridiculous. I finished the game and then spent 12 more hours on it until I could take no more and still am as far from the damned 'I Love Lucius' achievement as ever.
852	Great game, i really recommend it.
853	Good game totally worth it ..
854	If you've never played this kind of game you should give Lucius a shot. It's not perfect but it is interesting. Ok, now I'm just gonna go back to killing people.
855	A game about the devil. Finished it in 6.6 hours. 8/10
856	Lags to the point where I can't even play it :/
857	Actually really good. It's linear despite what it might lead you to believe. I got no bugs or anything. Story was alright, and the characters were interesting. Playing as the villian is strangely satisfying. Controls worked well, interface is good. not much to say. 4/5.
858	I wish there was a Neutral button.  This game feels kinda like an old hitman, but without all the different possibilities of killing. The game is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ at telling you what to do or what can be done, so be ready to alt tab-watch guide rinse-repeat.  Pro's: -The idea of being the son of lucifer is fun. -Murders are often awesome.  Neutral: Graphics, It's not very ugly, doesn't look good either though. Animations... same as above.  Cons: -Most of the time you have no idea what to do. -I couldn't find any mods to make the above better, in fact I couldn't find any mods at all and it's probably not supported. -Glitches are plenty, within the tutorial I picked up an item before Devildaddy told me to, and that was it.... stuck there forever untill restarting the level. -Voice acting and lipsync often failes. -You cannot choose how to murder people, you have to do it in a single specific way the game wants you to, and the game often doesn't tell you what that specific single way is.   Conclusion: If you like the idea of being the son of the devil and killing of everyone in the house one by one, then maybe get it.  Play it in short bursts, and prepare to read/watch lots of guides..
859	I watched Pewdiepie play this on Youtube, and then I rushed play it after. And I gotta say, I think Pewds was the best part of this game. Its just not that fun. So I actually recommend that you watch him play it, and save your money. 5/10 (by yourself) 8/10 (watching Pewds)
860	Wow &gt; luv this game  this is just the beginning there's more to come lol  
861	Very good game and mind thinking
862	This game makes its players struggle through its endless bugs, truly awful voice acting/animation, and cheesy dialouge with overuse of slow motion that gives the game an almost comedic tone.  Never the less, I did force my way though the levels, and I still got some fun out of it, but otherwise I'd really not reccomend this. It is just too shoddily made. 4/10.
863	I would have loved to play it however I can't due to a slow computer, I would love to know if they are working on a mac version and if they are when that would be released.
864	Completed 02/08/2016.
865	thsi game is fun and the creative ways to kill people are awesome. only problem i had was the camera was not what i was used to, but it was still good.
866	This game is a lot of fun. It is a nice change to be playing the bad guy. You play as a child possessed by the devil who goes round systematically murdering everyone. The gameplay is mostly puzzle based, you search the house collecting objects that you can use to precipitate the horrific death of your next victim. There are a couple of stealth missions which are quite annoying but they are only a minor part of the game. It is not the most polished looking game. The characters fall a bit too much into the uncanny valley, which works for the creepy child protagonist but is not that great for the others. And it appears they never got round adding in an animation for how the child gets his tricycle up the stairs so he just rides up and down the stairs. These are minor complaints overall it is fun, gruesome and has a good story.
867	A really fun game, there are some bugs... But worth the money
868	Even though that the deaths are scripted it is still a fun and funny game to play that will last you a while.
869	its completely demented but in a good way.
870	This game gave me a good impiression for the neat graphic. Although I could go and search within the limited area of a mansion, the graphic of furniture and art works is detailed and well placed. I would enjoy the scenery if this game was just a walking simulator. I also enjoyed the cut scenes that are adding good charm on the atmosphere. However, the puzzle was confusing for me. The player can collect items for the current chapter and for the next chapter or for any other at the same time. That means if a certain puzzle that I thought was for the current chapter was about to be solved, I couldn't pass the current chapter since it's supposed later. Sometimes I lost my way wondering what I should do next. But anyway, we can see the game guides that are already posted, so it wasn't a big deal for me. The story is so-so, having a little twist but overall linear. This is an evil vs justice story which sounds typical, but the protagonist is on the evil side. Voice acting is also satisfactory and it has English subtitle.
871	...............wow   ....................many victims   .....so funny   ......................................much kills  ..........very bloody  .................such game
872	If you want a game about murdering your family then this game is for you. Its a unique game I suppose although it is very rough. The narrative is good but its not great because you can't turn of subtitles and the voice actors are not that great. The murders are good but sometimes they don't always make sense. Sometimes their straightforward and you have no problems. Other times you can't figure them out and your forced to use a walkthrough. A shame the sequel to this game didn't turn out. This game could really use a re do to make better graphics and more lines of dialogue with better voice actors. Still, its good for 5 hours of fun.
873	Like a more linear Hitman with weaker voice acting and graphics. Avoid.
874	Very brutal death scenes, very bloody and very cool. However, this game has some hard missions, that can take some time to complete. Apart from that, 10/10.
875	Awesome tricycle sim... 10/10 would play again
876	10/10 would burn anyone
877	Lucius, from what I knew of it, seemed like a great game. It had an interesting premise, the opening animatic looked great, and the idea of killing people to gain devil powers seemed cool. And it is, in theory. The game itself is awful. It's glitchy and even broken at places, the graphics aren't really much, and overall, if I was asked if I'd purchase it again, I wouldn't. You're left to figure out what to do on your own most of the time, with very vague, and very unhelpful clues. The controls are utter rubbish, and you're unsure of how to do anything most of the time. For many things, it's a trial and error kind of process, and while that in itself isn't such a bad thing, here, you must know certain things (such as not stepping in a bedroom, having to crouch just right to kill someone, or having to be just behind a certain object enough to complete an objective) in order to even complete a level. It's great for laughs, though, at various glitches and some deaths.  In short, it's a terrible game and I wouldn't recommend getting it unless you don't mind frustrating controls and poor gameplay in exchange for some confused laughs.
878	A great violent game, different ways to kill people and a common but well-told story. supernatural abilities and 2 alternate endings. 8/10
879	Nice story, but â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ physics, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ graphics.
880	Playing this game has been really fun. The controls are not bad at all, and it's easy to pick up the game and just start playing. However, as the majority of people who have reviewed this game have stated, many times I was stuck wondering what to do. I also didn't favor running all around the house for the chores or items needed to make a kill. It seemed a bit tedious after a while. (â¥â¥â¥â¥ the laundry chore. Just skip it.)  But the kills! SO rewarding!  Lucius is one of the only games which compelled me to complete all of the Steam achievements. I have them all except for the 'I like this game' and 'I'm addicted' achievements. My only peeve with these 2 achievements is that it takes less than 5 hours to finish the game, so 40 hours is a LOT of time to fill!   Bottom line: -You get to be a cute little 6 year old who kills people. -Sweet powers from Satan himself. -You get to light people on fire. -You get a tricycle.  It's an enjoyable game. Get it on sale and play!
881	Half the time I don't know where I am supposed to go and the game is just plain slow and boring
882	From the devil satan father, then he speaks to his son for killing.
883	Yes if you like graphic death scenes and enjoy being the spawn of satan. However the story line does take a while to set itself up and its easier if you are reading a walkthrough since you are searching a large house for your next victim and murder weapon.
884	i love this game but hard to control at first
885	I haven't played much yet but i do plan to but so far, i'm loving the direction its headed towards.. After i finish my story, i shall come back to edit my review but for now, i find this game very creative, fun and i am really intriguied in the way its being unfolded.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sK2tOEBkJm4   I had done a video on it that probably no one cares about but this shows you the first chapter of it if you are interested.
886	Lucius was a lot of fun. Bought 1 and 2 on sale for around 5 bucks. Definitely recommend!
887	Even though it's an 'old' game, it's still very fun to play. Making my inner satan come out. 9/11
888	a game that is a hitman clone. it functions in almost the exact same way but can only kill targets in 1 very specific way. not to mention game breaking bugs that causes the game to crash. for example choosing puzzle option and throwing 2 specific tables causes the game to crash. last boss so to speak that you need to kill cant be done atleast not for me. all my powers were disables and could only run around
889	If you claim to not be able to enjoy playing the son of Satan in a game where the achievements is to kill people in all the ways you can imagine to kill them - you are lying. This is an awesome game, I wish it had lasted longer.
890	Reversed some crosses, burned some people, no one suspects anything, I'm just a nice child and surely not suspicous.  Nice story to play, don't check walkthroughs, cause it's too easy then. Buy it, enjoy, kill people have fun.
891	Nominated for The âVillain Most In Need Of A Hugâ Award.  This poor kid just needed some luv [of jesus]
892	very cool 
893	It got an interesting premise since it is like the unofficial video game adaptation of The Omen. That being the premise and the fact it comes from an indie studio are the only reasons why i can consider it an OK game and understand why some people love the game.  The only things that really bothered me about the game is that still has glitches considering how many updates it has had and that is very poorly optimized. It also got some really annoying achievements that force you to waste your time just for the sake of it. You can still manage to get them all in 15 hours like i did. If you don't care about the achievements, it can easily be finished in 10 hours or less. It may say in my profile or this review that i played this game for 40 hrs or more, Hell no, i just left it running to get 2 achievements that require it.  Hell yes that you may like it. Liking The Omen movie is a big requirement though.   In my case, I did liked it. However, I also got it for 1 dollar, so, that helped its case too.  [ Nominated it for a steam award ]
894	  THE GOOD 
895	I'll never look at a 7 year old the same way again
896	It's a very fun game! So delicious to play and figure out how to take care of your victims. I found the voice acting and some of the dialogue a bit poor, but it's a game worth playing.
897	I first seen this game on Pewdepie. (who else) It took me a while to get it. I used a shiity laptop to play the game. It runs around 30 fps at max on low setting but it is playable, just get at least 16 GB and a 980 Geforce to play this on good settings. The gameplay is a Hitman like clone but with no body draging and less freedom to do whatever. The Powers are only used in a certein place in the house. The playable charater is cool and I can't help but root for him. The game does have a game breaking bug that happens in the end of the game but it could be my PC than the game. The music is great and ok sound too. Voice acting is â¥â¥â¥â¥ but in the good old school horror way. The map can get coufsing and the game barly holds your hand so some traild and error is nessary. I think the story gets the job done.
898	So bad it's kind of good.
899	KILL YOUR FAMILY KILL YOUR FAMILY KILL YOUR FAMILY   Even if I didn't have the choice of the manner to kill my victims, the game was very pleasant for the sadistic person that I am :D  Satan/10
900	Don't ever mess with Satan son!!!
901	Decent gameplay and an interesting storyline, but vague puzzles, abilities being a bit confusing, and bad graphics bring the game down. 7/10. Still worth a try.  Gameplay: The gameplay worked out well and fit the game's theme. You had to pick up things and use powers while appearing to be a normal non suspicious child. If someone saw you with a gun, or psychically moving things around, you'd lose the level and have to start over. There were also side quests (or chores) you could do to get extra rewards to help you solve the levels. A weegie board to give riddle tips, a music box that gave limited use to see useful items around, but the last was a tricycle which was akward to maneuver through the halls and wasn't really worth getting.  Storyline: The storyline is well written and you can see bits of it happening while you walk around mid level. The characters all talk to you and will make comments about what all is happening which helped to expand the story. Add onto it the narrator explaining what all he saw going on and the connections he made after all was said and done being excellent really made the game worth while.  Puzzles: Not really sure they are puzzles, but the levels had you do a series of tasks you had to figure out to get someone killed. The first few levels were easy enough to figure out how to do them, the narrator explaining that something was learned from that death that was important for you to use during it. The later levels became overly vague on what you were doing, one of the levels being explained with 'She is doing laundry.' If you followed her around, she walked between a few places but you had to break something on the other side of the room to be able to kill her.  Abilities: As the game progresses, you get new powers. These powers level up as you get kills. There is no choice on what ability you level, nor is there an explanation of what these levels do. As far as I could tell, it was tracking progress through the game more than anything. To make things a little more complicated, some levels would start off with a tutorial on how to use an ability, then the level would prevent you from using it. The last ability even being removed from your ability choices after you get it. Though this was oddly done, each ability did get use at some point.  Graphics: Blocky and weird. I don't mind blocky graphics, aslong as I can tell what everything is, but a character would pick up an item in a video sequence and the object would move seperately from their hand. A little bit of effort would be appreciated in that, if it was part of gameplay and the other characters moved things around I could understand, but it was a predone video.   I had to look up walkthroughs for a few levels which frustrated me that the levels were too vague, but that could just be me. The graphics were still irelivant to my enjoyment and the abilities were easy enough to figure out the limits on my own.
902	The game was actually boring
903	Stuck To The Wall   10/10 Would Stuck Again ðð
904	Don't mess up with children. (Sorry for my broken english)
905	Well for $4.99 its a laugh, reminds me of the Omen Movies....there is something kinda fun roaming around and killing people as a 6 year old kid....lol Graphics are great for an Indie game, storyline short but intense, kinda game you play on a widescreen monitor in the dark.
906	fun game but its just a story no freeplay but its fun
907	Really awesome! The story and the solutions are already prescripted. So there is only one way to go through the game (only in the last mission you will have a choice to go for action or puzzle solving). But all in all the story is quite nice and it's all about finding the right keys and clues to do the murder. It's just fu*king great!
908	Great game, took about 5 hours to complete.. the deaths were entertaining!   Unfortunately the Last two Achievements are â¥â¥â¥â¥ing pathetic. A Big â¥â¥â¥â¥ you to the dev's for making me idle this â¥â¥â¥â¥ forever, it doesn't track the damn time correctly so far I have 46 hours counted by steam and still haven't got the stupid â¥â¥â¥ 40h achievement.   Idling the game while sitting in my room staring at the player like a creep so it's not like its on the menu or anything, not even alt-tabbed and the Achievements still take â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t time to get, it's just stupid padding â¥â¥â¥â¥ so people think 'Oh wow all these people played 48357975893479 hours this game must be awesome I'll buy it!'  ONLY BUY THIS GAME IN A BUNDLE, I GOT IT IN A $1.89 BUNDLE DO NOT PAY THE FULL PRICE  Other than the achievement annoyance it was fun the first run through.   # Finally managed to get the stupid 40h Achievement after 60 hours -.-
909	While the question of whether it's a good idea to put players in the role of a dead-eyed mute psychopath is open for debate, it's undeniable that Lucius's developers have captured the feel of their inspiration perfectly. There are missteps that keep the game from truly excelling, and the story is serviceable at best, but Lucius provides a unique horror gameplay experience, and any hardcore fans of the genre owe it to themselves to give it a look, provided they have strong stomachs.
910	Tired of shooters, rpg, action, even horror adventures? Good! How about taking the role of the son of the dark lord 'Lucifer' himself, huh? Took me around 5 hours to finish it from start till the very end, and i'll be damned it was worth it, yeah sometimes it can be buggy or stupid for some reasons... or very short. But! But i'm guarantee it's expirience worth playing :3
911	This is one of the best games I have ever played!
912	Watch my first impressions video of the game:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8RFJxg90ss 
913	Lucius Is AWESOME, great story!
914	Really freaking swaggy game right here.
915	Awesomely creepy game
916	this is an awesome game i ever played in my life but for my computer it laggs
917	It's entertaining, but starts to get a little repetitive after a while. Eventually, the novelty of essentially playing as the kid from The Omen wears off and the simplistic nature of 'gain a new psychic power, kill a person with it' starts to get old.
918	This game is a lot of fun. It is a nice change to be playing the bad guy. You play as a child possessed by the devil who goes round systematically murdering everyone. The gameplay is mostly puzzle based, you search the house collecting objects that you can use to precipitate the horrific death of your next victim. There are a couple of stealth missions which are quite annoying but they are only a minor part of the game. It is not the most polished looking game. The characters fall a bit too much into the uncanny valley, which works for the creepy child protagonist but is not that great for the others. And it appears they never got round adding in an animation for how the child gets his tricycle up the stairs so he just rides up and down the stairs. These are minor complaints overall it is fun, gruesome and has a good story.
919	Ever watched the Omen and thought 'wow, wouldn't it be fun to be the son of Satan?'. Well now you can. Lucius puts you in the shoes of a little boy who discovers on his 6th birthday that he is, in fact, the son of Lucifer, and that your true father is very interested in you conituning the family business of killing people in really nasty ways so he can have their souls.  The game is third person so you will always have the little tyke in your sights as you go around working out inventive ways of offing the people living in your family mansion. You can interact and pick up various objects, explore the mansion and do quests from murder to completing chores. After all, a good little boy does all his chores, while also killing. As you progress you also gain abilities like telekensis and mind control, making the murder more wholesome; after all, no one will suspect you if that object happens to crash down on someone without any outward control.
920	got this one during sale for like 3 or 5e, its great game, not that good looking but this game is not about it, lots of fun, good achievment, solid gameplay, 'story' if you wanna call it that way....  worth it
921	Half the time I don't know where I am supposed to go and the game is just plain slow and boring
922	From the devil satan father, then he speaks to his son for killing.
923	Best sacrafice sim I've played EVER!!! 10/10
924	This game is a great small sandbox game, it is not open world, but more of a sandbox. You are in a mansion, and can freely move anywhere, but limited to some places based upon progression; the more you progress, the more areas you can enter. If you are in it for the story, get it. I got this for 1 dollar, and was worth it, as it only took me 4 hours to complete, the levels in between are very short and small, and I would not consider this a puzzle, since it is way too easy. This game is rated A for adults only cause well...kids shouldn't play this =P 8/10 for very short chapters.
925	666/999 would recommend this game!! :D :D â¥
926	Great idea, sub-par execution.  Also, what's with the devs adding 20 and 40 hour playtime 'achievements' to a game that takes 7 hours to complete at most? That's insane considering it has literally zero replayability. You can't even decide how to off people, it's a linear story disguised as a sand-box 'hitman'-esque game.  Perhaps the devil really is in the details?
927	Got it on sale for $1. After playing it, I feel I would have paid up to $10; just not the normal asking price of $20. It is exactly what it says it is. A puzzle horror game putting you in the devilish shoes of a 6 year old antichrist. Pretty fun despite some flaws. Graphics aren't the best (but they work), lip sync is off sometimes during cut scenes which can take you out of the moment. Some of the acting is a little cheesy but overall good performances. One thing I wish was having more of a sandbox style for the killing. You have to kill people in very specific ways during each chapter, no choices. This is more akin to the old school point and click adventure games of the 90's (not in a bad way). I also would have liked to see a first person mode since much of your time is spend looking for items. When viewing as close as you can get in 3rd person the kids head blocks whatever the cursor is pointed at so you can't see it. All in all a fun experience. There is also a bonus game where you just try to kill priests using your fire spell, which was fun, but hard (they get into melee range and it's game over... damn crosses). Great value for the price I paid. If you enjoy old school horror movies like The Omen or Exorcist you will probably enjoy this game. Find it for $10 or less I would recommend picking it up.  If you are just looking for a slasher/shooter game go somewhere else, like I said this is a essentially a horror themed puzzle game.  Additionally they also have a sequel to this game, and it seems to have added in more open ended ways to kill people. Haven't tried it yet but thinking about checking it out.
928	Did you ever watch that movie called The Omen? This is pretty much that.
929	WTG(((WOW THIS GAME))) This is very nice horror story game. The story is very good. This game is about this boy have black magic to kill the people areound him. The Lucifer is a bad guy of this game not Lucius. The Lucifer controll him to kill people. All of this,This game is the best of horror story game!!!!! BUT Outlast is the really best Horror game. :) I didn't make it end yet,But soon. :)  Graphic:2/3 Story:5/5 Character:1/2 Total Score:8/10
930	I have a couple ways to recommend it, you choose which one tickles your pickles:  1) Do you like detective games? How about instead of solving mysteries, you would create them? ;D  2) Do you like the dark side? If so - this will be a sinister delight for you!  3) Murder! :|  4) Aggression begone! Oh, hello Lucifer o.o...
931	how this game got 81% possitive i have no idea, because it is a bore fest. you do next to nothing, just try to find your way around a house, pick up an item or two and use them to meddle with something which activates an ugly cutscene of someone dying. this is the worst assasination game i have ever played, dont buy
932	Okay, well, I wanted to play this game to have fun, but all it was is a linear omen rip-off with stiff stereotypical characters and voice acting that did not match the characters blank expressions and stiff body language. I have play indie games where the characters were more life-like than this and offered more gameplay. I don't see how you really can just go on a demonic killing spree. You have to do things in order and kill people in order. You can shoot people, it might get you caught, but at least it might count towards the acheivment. You're limited of how and when to use your 'demonic powers'. It would have been nice for the game to have been environmentally interactive other than the mission ojective items so as the player break glass, create disturbances, and just cause mental havoc.  I got this game on sale with a bunch of other games. After playing this game myself, it's not worth the $20 it's currently being sold for and find it's ridiculous. If one must get this game I suggest waiting for a big sale, maybe one that knocks it down to $7 or less, preferable $4. Good luck!  Note: I came across this site while looking at the news page for Lucius. Even though it's a review for Lucius II, it may help alot on describing the game as based on someone else's experience much like my own and the expectations of the game and what was really delivered: From RockPaperShotgun  http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/02/17/impressions-lucius-ii/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+rockpapershotgun%2Fsteam+%28Rock%2C+Paper%2C+Shotgun%3A+Steam+RSS%29   NOTE: This is my personal opinion and thoughts of the game, not an overall view if the game for general audience. As with many reviews and opinions, take this with a grain of salt and do your own research.
933	Ok, so people that know me know I enjoy horror films, this was an...Intriguing concept to say the least, when it succeeds, it shines, when it fails...It crashes into a fiery wreck on the I-90. I'm going to continue to play it because it caters to my particular tastes but...Its not for everyone. It has a beautifully done open world, really crummy voice acting, an actually intriguing storyline, and for those that put up with its quirks they will find a satisfactory gaming experience which falls just short of how good it could have been
934	for freeeee
935	Woke up, rode my trike into the garage, doused my mechanic in gasoline, and set that n-word on fire.
936	OH GOD ITS SO EVIL. Yet somehow... I really liked it. I woudln't reccomend this game for people who don't like solving pretty complex and non-obvious puzzles (sometimes they were really out of sight), but its interesting to solve and watch the death cutscenes. Didn't like the repetetive things that the game characters said but it's not really too bad. Some minor glitches in the game but overall decent! I'd reccoment this game to anyone who enjoys murder mysteries, puzzles and a good story. 7/10
937	cool and evil game lol
938	I like this game. It's a bit buggy and glitchy but on sale it's worth it. Had to use a walkthrough for my first mission or two but it was all good. Can't wait for the sequel.
939	It's a silly and nice game but the game  very  often expects you to make the connection of what to do to advance yourself with vague or little to no hints. Also a lot of the A.I of the people in the game are wonky a lil, leading to some frustrations, and at one point I was forced to restart game because I got glitch where the girl you kill stands up in the bathtub :(  It decent.
940	Childhood. Birthday cake. Playground. Friends. Family. Schooling. Presents. Horsing around. Dead bodies aplenty. Huh? Now, most people would never equate dead bodies with their childhood but you will when you play as the son of the devil. Lucius is the a gem of a game beacause it flourishes with what so many fps video games refuse to admit to: that we don't need a reason to kill anyone. Okay, in Lucius 'dad' wants more souls so we have to kill people for that reason. However, like every other gamer whom has played this game the joy of Lucius lies in the simple question 'whom should I kill today?'. As I played I thought of a song from a little known heavy metal band from detroit called Meliah Rage. That song was 'Kill To Survive'. As people died before my eyes in all matter of gore I sang to myself, 'I kill for killing, cause killing is my life..... I kill to survive'. That's as much as I can remember but this game delivers that devilsih joy of just killing people. Of course if I had made Lucius it would get ban every where on Earth because there are levels of depraivity, narcisism, and homicidal intention that people in the real world sink into without remorse. I would have given the gamer not just mind control but several options to make those dummies do something disgusting. Hopefully the secong game of Lucius will set our murderous selves free and let the gates of hell consume the world. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Thumbs up.
941	I got to hail satan and kill my parents.
942	11/10 IGN m9s, I liket teh pert wer u 360 noscop teh illuminaty leadr
943	So, only a day into playing Lucius I am already enthralled in starting my career as a profressional serial killer. Not only has this game taught me the necessary skills, but it has helped me master the art of confering with the devil.  10/10 would sell my soul again!
944	Not bad at all, but a bit disappointing at the same time.   I must admit that I was never  that big fan of  Omen  movies, but I know them quite well, which made me wondering if this game will try to replicate and refer to it, as the main character, place and story seems quite, well, familiar for everyone who watched Omen.  As for the story - it's simple, slowly progressing as you make your next kills. Not much to say about it - probably could be a bit better seeing that all adults seem really clueless. But oh, this is the part of fun.   Graphics and music are also okay  - I wasn't experiencing any sudden drop rates or weird rendering bugs - it's alright. I don't pay much of attention to graphics as long as they are fine-tuned. Animations and cutscenes are good, but the fact that little Lucius is keeping his poker face all the time is weird, or scary either. As for music I wouldn't expect more. the single track that keeps repeating in background while playing is matching game's atmosphere.   IBut as for gameplay.  Eh, here we go. The game itself isn't that sophisticated, I would call it fairly easy, but... Yeah. I've been playing adventure games for quite a long time but Lucius left me annoyed at times. Looking for a small, few pixels big object to break, or item to pick up isn't the way. And this brings up another topic. There's only one way to complete game. Everyone's way to hell is planned by developers and you need to follow it. No exceptions. You can't lit on fire a cute lady that is supposed to be poisioned. You can't shoot her in the face and then mind control the cop who caught you into commiting suicide with the same gun. For obvious reasons - this isn't sandbox game and any non-linear deaths would cause the whole scripted story-line to collapse. As for length of the game - took me around eight hours to complete. Could be better. Why people aren't trying anymore? There are some bugs, some of them causing game to crash (picking up dad's ammunition for the second time).  I know that Lucius 2 is around the corner and it's promised to be different game, making up for some of it's precursor mistakes. We shall see.   6/10 - Original game concept, but disappointing gameplay.  + Game concept, because there's nothing better than killing your family members on cold, winter night. + Game length. Of course another hour or two wouldn't be bad. + Heh, son of satan.  - Too linear. - Some annoying gameplay stuff.
945	A good horror game. :)
946	9/10 would kill stuff again
947	it is a bit limitted, i mean you cannot kill anyone that you want or how you want, but it's still a nice game.
948	An aglamation of interesting concepts that don't quite bear fruit. By the time you get to the middle or late missions, you're checking your diary and trying to decipher the incredibly vague clues you've scribbled down for yourself. It's like having a DM in D&amp;D running the Tomb of Horrors for your party, and he won't give you a straight damn answer no matter how well you roll.
949	Hitman + Harry Potter = Lucius If you like Hitman you should like this
950	Being a spawn of Satan is fun, so you know.
951	It's The Omen meets Hitman.   You play a kid who must kill people to apease your dad. It definitely pulls from the movie The Omen. While not as good as the film, it's still fun.  It may not have the greatest graphics or then best voice acting. it's still a great time killer.
952	Great game 100x better than the 2nd don't even bother with that one!
953	Aight
954	Best sacrafice sim I've played EVER!!! 10/10
955	Multiverse Hitman game where Agent 47 grew up in an upper-class suburban home rather than a cloning facility, killing his entire family in his pyjamas.
956	Lucius is a brilliant game, what other game allows you to play as the son of satan an offspring of evil and hate. Who doesn't want to play as a demented 6 year old child with an uncanny lust for murder.  The Constant dramatic Cinematics and Blood thirsty gory ways in which the player can kill someone just add to the puzzle solving feature to this game. Lucius gives players a Non-linear gameplay in which the player can be rewarded. Doing the chores in Lucius not only adds to the gameplay and story but also keeps this boys cover in check and rewards the player with items they can use later in the game e.g. a Trike which allows Lucius to move around freely throughout the house.  Murdering in lucius also gives the player rewards handed to you by the demonic figure of satan with help from these nasty abilities and the problem solving of the player, murdering becomes all that much sweeter.  So dive right in for the demonic and demented mind of Lucius I rate this game 8.5 DAX points out of 10
957	Evil 6 year old child simulator. Aside from your main objective of killing every living person in the house, there are an array of side quests that include helping mommy with chores, picking up panties, and riding around in circles on your badass tricycle. 10/10 would kill again
958	This is one of the best games. I'm really glad I purchased it during this special offer of being only 2 euros.  You roam a large mansion and kill your victims in stealth by using verious items. You gain abilities such as telekenises and mind control. It is one of the best game for sure, specially after you get your ride, it adds to the great atmosphere of an evil protagonist.
959	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tare0EnzWTA  Note : Recommended if it's going for a cheap price...   Lucius didn't have much chance of leading a normal life, right from the get go, he's the subject of a summoning ritual while in the womb, and if that wasn't bad enough, at age 6 Satan decides it's time he became a contract killer.  Though don't get your hopes up that this is childhood assassin's creed, there's no combat, or planning out your custom method for taking out the designated target. Instead each 'level' is; you wander around until the camera zooms over to your designated target, then you look at what's around that the game wants you to use to kill them. Sometimes the game helps you out and zooms in on your implementations of death too. Some of these kills get quite creative, others are pretty dumb and sadly others are obscure to the point of frustration. Speaking of which, there's also a night time stealth mission, which is probably the lowest point of the game.  As the body-count increases Satan comes more impressed with your ability and grants you additional powers. The most useful is telekinesis, allowing you to interact with things from a distance. Sadly the remaining powers are pretty limited in their uses; Mind Control does exactly that, but its a case of knowing when the game expects you to use it, who to use it on, and what specifically they are supposed to interact with, which really destroys the potential for experimentation. There's also fire, which serves as pretty much your only form of direct offense.  While the premise is pretty dumb, and working out what the game wants you to do can be laborious, the game does have some pretty interesting puzzles on offer, and what's more just the idea itself more than makes up for the lack of sparkle in the execution.  Sure, there isn't much to the world (it all takes place in a pretty large house) and it doesn't look great; the character models are serviceable, but the animations are really quite poor, and the voice acting (while there's lots of it) is pretty forgettable (except one of the maids and the terrible attempt at an accent). Oh and in the credits they list out all the free sound effects and music that was used in the game...  But for as idiotic as the plot is, it's pulled off so well! The progression from working your way up from the lower tiers of the household and the increased violence that accompanies keeps the game chugging along at a decent pace and leaving you wondering what could possibly be up Lucius' sleeve next.  The storytelling is actually pretty amazing, and the game manages to maintain the dark mood almost the entirety of it (a few of the kills are pretty dumb). An investigator chalking the initial deaths as accidental, the belief that the house is cursed, the idea that there's some kind of coverup, how the blame shifts from one character to another... It a really interesting tale. Sure the actual script isn't on point 100% of the time, but the idea stands up and shines through despite the shortcomings of the game.  Lucius, from a gameplay perspective, is not a delight to play, everything about the implementation is incredibly average to below average... But it is saved by it's plot, which is memorable and something that I've actually discussed with friends, even if only to talk about how messed up some parts are... Which is something that I haven't done with games that have far more polish. It may be asking a lot to overlook the aesthetics, but if you're willing to, you'll uncover one of gaming's better told stories.
960	Almost impossible to figure it out without going crazy and quiting or checking an online walkthrough. Anyway, the game itself has an unique concept and storyline. +Very good for a puzzle game, and games like Penumbra and Amnesia, where you have to find items and know how and when to use them. -Bad optimization even for a game from 2012. +Graphics are above average of a 2012 game but poor customization overall. (No anti-aliazing, shadow configuration and I can't figure out if the resolution is actually the one I chose.) -Personally I expected more complexity from the game itself but the 'powers' you get you use them not very often, and they become obnoxious. +The idea of the game is spectacular and i'd love to see a sequel.
961	The hell with this. 
962	Inventory is only usable with the scroll wheel. When the game even bothers to respond to the scroll wheel, it scrolls to the very first or very last item, making the game completely unplayable. Waste of money.
963	I'll recommend only if your computer is not as â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up as mine. This game works in slow motion and the I can't do the 1st mission, which is lock the maid in the freezer, byt locking the door when she enters to clean. The game is bugged for me as she doesn't enter the freezer and stay on the door cleaning and I can't close it and lock it. If your computer is as â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up as mine, so please do not buy it, cause it will be a waste of money. *sighs*
964	great and cinical game, fun. i liked it
965	It's just a cheap knock-off the Hitman series.  Study targets movements, follow directions, identify patterns, use all to kill target.  Dull.
966	If you are burning with love of god and christ, play this game.
967	First blood was pointless and not rewarding. Next scene was like, 'WTF'.
968	Can brake bottles of vine!  10/10 broken bottles of vine! :wasted:
969	Just glicthed on me out of nowhere on chapter 10 and now wont let me use the invictory and do my hypnosis ....this game needs to be fixed!!!
970	This game is boring as â¥â¥â¥â¥
971	I'll admit that the gameplay is a bit awful, but the game makes up for it with an interesting story and gruesome deaths. You feel powerfull murdering as Lucius while the detective and the residents of your house just can't figure it out that you're the one responsible. The graphics and music are just decent, and the game is short. Has a lot of achievements but one needs you to play (or idle) for 40 hours, where you'll need around 8 hours to beat it. It's an interesting game, but i can only recommend it on sale. For one or two bucks it's worth it.
972	Awesome tricycle sim... 10/10 would play again
973	I love watching peopleplaying the game. I don't like to play it myself. I love killing people, this game is funny and brings up good jokes on the way. But, since the game is old, I find the controlring system kinda annoying and buggy sometimes... Still recommending this game for people who want to record for youtube or play with friends!
974	I greatly enjoyed this game. Yes, there were times when the journal was too vague to figure out but that doesn't outweigh the rest of the game. I personally loved it.
975	I want to like it, but the puzzles are far, far too vague. I'm not expecting hand-holding, but once through the tutorial there is precisely zero guidance on what to do next, it's not obvious from context. If you like having to work out literally everything about a game through trial and error, this is the game for you. Otherwise, move on by, nothing to see here.
976	This game is top notch best game i've ever played
977	Short but...   The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire, The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire, The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire, We don't need no water let the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ burn, Burn â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ burn. 
978	Rough around the edges but fun, original, and it makes you think.
979	Lucius thrives on the suspenseful build-up and gruesome pay-off of its high body count, but not much else. The delectable killings seesaw between immersion shattering hilarity and visceral jolts of brutality. The game rapidly falls apart towards the end, as all charm that was present is thoroughly eradicated. Don't go in expecting anything of substance that demands multiple playthroughs.  An intriguing concept tarnished by a shoddy delivery.  5/10
980	Really loved the game, and obviously the fact of beeing son of the devil &gt;:3. Funny to play, average cutscenes, but not as interactive and 'free' as lucius 2 in my opinion, cuz you have to follow the rules and have limited space to work with. BUT, it doesnt prevent it to be a good game!  Probably a 8/10, and recommendable! :D
981	evil demon child lol
982	The concept of a young devilish child reaving havoc was one that definately piqued my interest, however, sadly dissapointed with the gameplay. One of the many problems I found with this game that I don't usually have with many others is that I have to constantly refer to other sources for help. You will find yourself looking for quest items that are often way too subtley hidden in a mansion where you will pace back and forth, room to room just looking for something to get by. The problem lies in the lack of the games ability to aid the player without necessarily giving anything away (Note: You are given a tool to find items but even this is given 6 limits and can only be used in a room so it is nontheless wasteful unless you know the item could be in a specific room). Even better yet this could be solved with a non-linear format, one which provides players the ability to use multiple killing methods. This would increase replayibility and ease the painfully dullness of searching items. Some of the game mechanics lacked sense, for instance why give certain abilities only to be limited. The game sacrifices player free reign with a linear story line which isn't that great to begin with. You'd think that with multiple deaths in one home would peak the interest of the media (besides the one journalist) and feds or perhaps even motivate the family or employees to move out, but the characters all lacked sense regardless of how 'strange' or accidental the deaths are. It's no surprise that the sequel, (yes there's a sequel) didn't do well. Once the intial pique of the concept passes, theres hardly anything else that holds you there. The game needs to be rebooted, everything but the concept out the window.
983	It seems like a great game but can't get it to start on my Windows 10 PC
984	This game is top notch best game i've ever played
985	Erm... where should i begin? First of all, the price is way too high for this game. 20 euros? are you kidding me? i bought it for 0.94, and i still want my money back... Well, the story is... just another Satan's Son story, that kills people just because he's Satan... It seemed promissing when i saw it, but after an hour of playing... i change my mind Environments were... uhm... really large, but weird done. Poor animations, choppy transitions, non-existent facial expresions, also very very stupid AI. I'm sorry guys, i thought this game would be cool and fun to play, but gets repetitive after THE FIRST CHAPTER! '2/10 would refund' -Nick It was unexpectedly bad...
986	Not enough hinted in the gameplay, and far too much is narrowly locked down to fit the deaths of each people. The game pretends to allow you some roaming ability and general freedom as you sneak around the house, but you quickly find you're basically on rails the entire time.
987	Entertaining game if you like being a devil and killing your family.
988	was a good game if you like puzzel games you have to think alot, its alot of fun being the devild son when you walk around a mantion killing most of your staff.haigly recommend it if you have the pastion fore it
989	If you like puzzle games with smooth controls and a refined stealth system, then this is definitely  NOT  the game for you.   I can't think of a kind word to say about Lucien, either the titular character or his 'adventure'. The entire thing is on rails, to the point of explaining what happens before you do it â no suspense, not even the illusion of choice â and constantly swapping between flagrant handholding and dropping you into a room with no idea what to do except flail at the glitchy and painfully-limited interface until something happens.   Then there's the horrible model animation; characters's limbs and held objects routinely clip through things, and it doesn't seem like they bothered at all to syncronise movements to interactions.. Despite there being very few interactions to be displayed. The ONLY positive is the well-detailled house itself, but you'd better get used to it because you never go anywhere  else .  All in all, Lucius takes the worst from point-and-click games and combines it with the worst from 3d RPGs.. and I haven't even mentioned the part where the  six year old child  you play takes photographs of people having sex, or visits a room full of nothing but softcore pornography and sex toys. One has to wonder whether this game was made for anything other than shock value.
990	IM SO EVIL.
991	For the price, its not a bad game. A little clunky but you get used to it after a little bit.   Edit:  Bugged achievements have really made this game obnoxious. As an achievement hunter, this game would normally be an easy 100% completion. A lot of achievements will unlock as you play through, and also a lot will trigger without doing all the requirements. But when you play and play and play and the time achievements don't trigger(see my play time) it pisses me off to the point i'm glad I got this game for free from an auction site. Don't buy it outright. Find a special or a bundle if you feel you must play this.
992	not very clear with this game...
993	its a good game a really good game but its not for me.
994	This game is messed up beyond anything i have ever played. You play a 7 year old who is the devil's son and you murder people. reminds me of the omen and children of the corn. Good game if you're into gory messed up games.
995	If yo are a satanist and enjoy killing and watching people suffer then this is the game for you!  I beat this in the shortest time possible for me, i was addicted to this games story and now im gonna try the second one
996	We are part Satan in this game.   RECOMMEND  10/10 
997	Bugs, bugs, bugs, inconsistencies, stupid scenario, low fluidity, bugs.
998	anti-christ? anarchist? kill them all. rule the world, watch it burn!
999	  Well this game, is kind of complicated,altough it's really satisfing, the moment when you get all the puzzel's pieces and finish a level. This is a game for a vast mind, and a lot of thinking. I really reccomend this game.
1000	It wasn't bad it kept me there for almost 10 hours it has no replayability though. bad powers hard to use control. the whole game is just a big puzzle that has one way and one way only to beat it Can't recommend buying also the soundtracks are annoying as â¥â¥â¥â¥ 
1001	  This game is quite hard to put down. On one hand, it has a good feel, like a horror movie, on the other hand its annoying and repetitive. The puzzles are easy, there is no problem solving them, the murders are very graphical. There is a sex scene with a fat guy banging a maid, there is peeping on another maid when she takes a bath... everything seems to be in place but I wish it wasnt so linear. It has no replay value, takes like 5h to complete it, but there are achievements for playing it for 40 hours. I mean, no clue what the point of that is, but I'm probably gonna get it just by afking in game. I'll give it a thumbs up but only if you didnt pay for it more than 5â¬
1002	Nice game ! 666/10 Hail Satan |-|
1003	This game has an achievement which wants you to play the game for like 40 hours. That is not happening.  The killing is extremely linear in this game. If it wasn't, I would love this game. In the end, its ok.
1004	I wish I was Lucius 666
1005	nice game, i found this game in youtube, when pewdiepie play it.
1006	Honestly Ive played through this game and almost 100%'ed the achievments, in my personal opinion a brillaint game would definatley recomend it. I found hours flying by and me saying to my self, just one more murder. The story lines okay could be better but overal I'd definatley say give it a chance.
1007	I killed many adults like a complete â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ while being satanbabby 10/10
1008	this is a fun little a game where you play as a evil little boy killing the unsuspecting people in your family's manor to gain dark powers.  pros -unique concept -really embracing evil, which is not really common in gaming -nice story, but it could have been much better  cons -some powers were not very useful, one of them, telekinesis, was simply useless. the controls for it were that bad -house layout was very confusing. it takes time to get used to it, but this is a short game. -doing chore could have had more impact -the ending could have bee better  score : 7/10  just get it with steam sales
1009	Lucius had a nice idea for those of us who appreciate dark humour what with finding novel ways to kill his family and friends. However, there's not much creativity involved as you have set ways in which to get about your evil ways so the replay value is really low. The controls are clunky which often leads to frustrated mashing of buttons and a complete loss of immersion. Oh, and it doesn't matter if you've already figured out what to do, the game just won't let you do it until you've gone through the entire house looking for Lucius' thought processes so that HE figures out what has to be done.  Oh and the achievements are ridiculous. I finished the game and then spent 12 more hours on it until I could take no more and still am as far from the damned 'I Love Lucius' achievement as ever.
1010	I don't think I like you, DIE!
1011	The game was pretty, engaging &amp; overall pleasant experience. I really like the cheeky, yet simple storyline, &amp; exploring is a bunch of fun.   My experience: Personally I love exploring, &amp; I seemed to rush ahead from the story so when I went exploring I would find items or places specified for a chapter, &amp; get confused with the items &amp; places alot. They had a weird balance between being able to interact with some future chapter items, while some not at all, which didn't help me. When the eye icon showed up &amp; I clicked it, for particular things it wouldn't say anything which to me defeats the purpose of putting an eye icon.   Needs fixing: I had trouble at chapter 19 because the head statue I was meant to use didn't spawn in the right spot.  Recommendations: Chores are great, I was able to get all the gifts in the first 2 chapters. Make sure to read the clues carefully, &amp; look around the rooms to find all the items &amp; hints u can find. If u are really stuck hold an item up that u expect to use, &amp; it will give u a indicator to show u where to place it. Use ur abilities wisely &amp; u will do great.
1012	This my own likes and dislikes of the game  Likes &gt;Graphics Is great for old game &gt;Good Storyline &amp; Scenes &gt;Get to play as Villian which is rare in games &gt;Alot of Interaction &gt;After few unlocks be able to explore alot the house  Dislikes &gt;NPCS can get stuck &gt;NPCS detecting you can seem almost impossible to avoid   Is the game worth buying? I quite impressed with this game and sure is worth the buy in my opinion
1013	â¥â¥â¥â¥ para â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
1014	I watched Pewdiepie played this game before so i had interest in buying it. At first i was like hmm should i buy the game or not... But i was like meh.. F*ck it! It took me 6.5 hrs to finish the game.  #PlayedWithWalkthroughs #noob   Pros: -Has a great story -You can unlock cool stuff like a bike if you're a good boy! (if you do some chores) -You get to see some ;) (you'll see) -Decent graphics  -Decent voice acting -SATISFYING KILLS AND SH*T!  Cons: -Some characters in the cutscenes have late reactions (LOL) -There are some bugs but its minor. -Few powers sadly :( -The game's kinda short tho -YOU DEFINITELY NEED GUIDES AND WALKTHROUGHS TO FINISH THIS -Can be boring at times if you don't know what to do...  10/10 would Recommend this Unholy game :P  Give me a +rep in my profile if you found this review helpful :)   Thanks!
1015	Awesome game, cool content and great 'killcams' :D
1016	How to be the antichrist. I had fun killing those meat bags. lol
1017	this is a fun little a game where you play as a evil little boy killing the unsuspecting people in your family's manor to gain dark powers.  pros -unique concept -really embracing evil, which is not really common in gaming -nice story, but it could have been much better  cons -some powers were not very useful, one of them, telekinesis, was simply useless. the controls for it were that bad -house layout was very confusing. it takes time to get used to it, but this is a short game. -doing chore could have had more impact -the ending could have bee better  score : 7/10  just get it with steam sales
1018	great game.
1019	Fun, interesting, very dark humor that I quite appreciate, but you can't really read the description of this game without expecting dark humor. The puzzle solutions are not quite as clear as they could be in some areas, you might end up on a bit of a search, and I am currently stuck at a stealth portion that is very frustrating. I will go back and beat it at some point though, I would recommend this to any of my friends who like this kind of humor and puzzles.
1020	666/10
1021	It's a ok game but I expected there to be more freedom, it's all too scripted.
1022	The Omen simulator
1023	This game is soooooo badass, the graphics are cool, but overall it's just fun to play as the Devils son. 8/10
1024	.
1025	Well its easy:   - Don't play if you're a good person!
1026	- Generally speaking, it's a really fun game. - Good amount of play time, it took me 6 hours of playing to finish it. - The puzzles can be quite challenging and take some time (can be good for some, may be bad). - Involves some elements of stealth (can't get caught holding something or doing something bad, as well as not being caught running around at night). - Includes 'side quests' (you get chores to do and get rewards) - General gameplay is quite nice (other than a few bugs) - Key mapping is great and easy to use 
1027	i played like 2 hours and the game is kinda interesting !!
1028	..
1029	pro  - cool idea - big house to explore - music  cons  - Theres no hints where to go or what to do. - Damm big house gets boring when u have to wander around it over and over again. - Laggy - Glitchy - cant kill how u want  Buy it on sale, otherwise i dont recommend it. Liked it from the start , but after like 2 hours im ready to abandon it gets so boring.
1030	This game has me just thinking woah the whole time. The idea that a little kid has powers from lucifer and kills people, while having time to take out the 'trash.'
1031	Nice game!
1032	i realy liked this game it was so fun to play but i ran into a lot of bugs i realy liked the gameplay it was fun to run around the house and kill people but i got stuck on some parts like killing uncle tom but over all fun 9/10
1033	Oh Lucius, with his blank expression and dead eyes.   Overall a pretty fun and wellmade game, although a bit aÌ¶nÌ¶tÌ¶iÌ¶cÌ¶hÌ¶rÌ¶iÌ¶sÌ¶tÌ¶ anticlimactic by the time the credits roll. Stepping into the tiny shoes of Lucius you get the sense and feel of what made the Hitman games so inventive although once you scratch that surface, the goals are much more linear and there's really only one true solution to wiping out each member of the household. Sure you can experiment and have fun, but this will always lead back to a 'game over' screen. This doesn't make each chapter any less fun.   Honestly, I had a great time running aroung a confusingly constructed house, observing many of the twisted occupants, and then gleefully offering them to that Lucifer fella. There's a lot of fun little detail (shine your flashlight on Lucifer,) so many gruesome deaths, a bunch of chores to do, and math class.   Definitely worth the price of admission.
1034	Definantly recommended for hours upon hours of fun. This game is excellent for those who are into horror-ish ames, or, with the right sense of humor, a few good laughs.
1035	This is not a scary game... It's evil, you are the scary. So far though i've been loving how the games plays out aside from the fact that my map was drawn by a 6-year-old and finding out what/how to kill the next subject is explained. They say you have to listen to the people around the house but they are very vague. It's like they took lessons from castlevania 2.   Aside from that though the games controls are pretty good and simple. Graphics aren't bad either aside from when some areas are too dark. All in all 7/10
1036	I was very supprised with this game. After finishing this game I look back and realize there are three things that makes this a game i can recommend. 1. The house is a character, the house has alot of detail and is layed out in a manner that makes it fun to traverse. 2. Not sure if it is intentional, but its like a bad horror movie you get to play. Some of the sappy things that you would see happen in 80's horror movies, make this game fun. 3. This game would be a complete disaster if it didn't control good, but the controls work great and make alot of sense, and the parts that are not that great make for fun to master like the telekenisis. If you can get this on a sale it makes it even better, but if not I would still recommend this game a purchase.

1038	As a player who decides what games to buy based on the reviews of the certain game, it's my duty to write a complete review about any game i finish, so here is my review:  LUCIUS:  Lucius a game where you are a kid of a rich family, the son of Lucifer (your family doesnt know that, that is what makes the game exist), where you get orders from your father to bring him 'tributes' by killing people. The thing is, nobody must find out who you really are nor what can you do, so, by using your mind and your powers you have to make every kill look like an 'accident'.  Before i procceed with the PROS and CONS i would like to remind anyone who is reading this that these are my personal preferences and may differ by any individual who plays the game.  PROS: +Very good story. +Even if it isn't listed anywhere, it is an open world game, you can get almost anywhere in the house at any time of the game. +You can get a bunch of items in the inventory that can be usefull at any time.  CONS: -The map is almost uselss, it has no explanation of the place nor your target. Needs too much thinking on finding out where to go. -The controls of the bike are bad, like trying to play a shooter game with a joystick bad. -The achievements are not a challenge at all, you can just do something, then replay it 4 times to get the achievemnt, doesnt matter if you get a Game Over. -The 40-hour achievent has no use at all, this a 8-13 hour game, you just have to leave the game running all night.  TL;DR It is a good, not great, psychological horror game and has a good story. Get it on sale  8/10
1039	ur an evil kid trying to annihilate ur own family.
1040	666/10
1041	Great game,very hard,but still a great one 10/10 would kill people again
1042	Good game with good plot. It's an easy game. Not much to think :) but it give me a lot of fun. Also its easy to get all achivments :) game have some bugs but its playable. for me 5.5/10
1043	If you've never played this kind of game you should give Lucius a shot. It's not perfect but it is interesting. Ok, now I'm just gonna go back to killing people.
1044	I really like this game, and feel bad about liking it at the same time. For anyone who has seen any of 'The Omen' movies, the main story is pretty much the same, for the ones that haven't, here it is. You play as Lucius (duh) the son of Lucifer (pinnacle of evil etc.) and you job as his son is to give him offerings in the form of human life. You start of easy with little accidents that leads to fatalities, and slowly work your way up with power he grants you as you go along. You live in a huge mansion with lots of staff, maids, a driver, mechanic, custodian and you even have a private tutor. Each mission introduces something new you can do or have to do, in order to act innocent you have to appear to be a good boy and do chores, which gives you presents (that's how parenting works) This game have some issues though, for me it was mainly graphics, in the form of lighting effects that were way off at times, but also some crashes, which is really annoying because you can't save. The game autosaves for you, mostly after a kill (a new chapter begins). It still alot of fun though and there alot you can do, and it takes you awhile to figure everything out in every mission. Overall a solid experience and loads of innocent blood. 6.7/10
1045	I love satan but its a bit buggy :/ get it on sale its pretty amusing
1046	When buying this game, I knew that it would either be amazing or horrible. Lucius succeeds in surpassing my expectations with it's artistic flair and gripping story. with a plot heavily inspired by The Horror Classic 'The Omen' yet cis creative enough to pump in original ideas and establish its own identity, Lucius triumphs in a storytelling view. the visuals work well with fleshed out character designs and and a beautiful mansion setting, large enough to work as a world within the game and can be explored throughout. If there was one thing to gripe about it's the controls. Lucius has only two speeds: Slow as S#it or fast as F*@k, depending on if you sprint or not. still, the game is well worth a play and I highly reccomend it
1047	This is a great game and I definitely recommend it to everyone!
1048	I feel like this game is like on the Movie: The Omen.. It's about the birth of a boy whom his family does not know the truth that he is the son of Satan.. It's a cult game but will get repetetive soon since you are exploring a small amount of world..
1049	this game was soo much fun xD  well worth the purchase
1050	Got this for $2 on a Steam sale, not worth more. This is an incredibly frustrating, glitchy point-and-click I had to consult a walkthrough for on almost every level, because you are given almost no clues and controls are not straightforward (ex: really hard to lift objects with telekinesis and get them where they need to go). I frequently got clipped between front doors and cabinet doors and had to restart. Other reviews made it sound like there was more of a story; characters repeat the same line of dialogue every time you approach them each chapter, so you don't care about any of these doll-like creatures. 'Chores' are a fairly meaningless function unless they're central to the person you're supposed to kill that chapter. Since this is obviously an homage to The Omen, I was really hoping for all-out 70s references and decor, but there is none. Only thing I got a kick out of was Lucius's resemblance to Mads Mikkelsen and the soundtrack. Kept playing just to see all the ways he would kill, and because I try my darndest to complete something I've paid for, but Lucius has no replay value and little payoff the first time around.
1051	Really fun to play through, wish it was a little bit longer though! The music and the atmorsphere was really good! A game you should defenatly play during halloween! Hopefully the sequel is better or just as good, fingers crossed!
1052	An entertaining puzzle game with a unique concept. It's actually a lot of fun and features some great music and controls! However, the second half of the game becomes lazy with the puzzle design, almost as if the product was rushed. Also, you are forced to murder people in specific ways while being restricted to a small environment to explore. Get past all of this, and there's still a solid game underneath.
1053	Is an old game that I will never forget.
1054	iz good fam bcoz you gt to kill peopl for no reazon coz you iz teh devils son and dat iz fun :) dere iz also a sex scene so 20000000/10 IGN wud ploy agin
1055	A smart game with a great story and lots of character. There is many well made cinematics and good use of music. I very much enjoyed running around the classically decorated old mansion discovering how to take out each target. I had to resort to a walkthrough for just a few parts but that hasn't made the game any less enjoyable. I'm just a few chapters in and so far I'm very impressed. This is a must play for practical thinkers and murder enthusiasts alike.
1056	Surely better than the second game. Got lost more than once in that big â¥â¥â¥ manor.
1057	Why Is My Game In A 3D Effect Please Help Turn It Off
1058	enjoy this games really. cos i can kill everyone as we want like serial killer. but we cant choose how we kill them
1059	Idea and story of this game is not bad at all. I can more or less say that I enjoy final cinematic with murder for every chapter, but what I definetly didnt enjoy was the way to it.   Since like chapter 8 whenever I wasnt sure what to do next, I better look into walkthrought because you are constanly running from one point to another with mostly no idead what you looking for (some items are very small and not indicated in any way) with wasnt fun at all. Also technical part of game is kinda bad and most of the character are just roaming mansion and repeat 1-2 sentece, with really didnt help with atmosphere.  So overall not the worst game, but for me to be enjoyable experience, it would need much more work into it.  
1060	This is a perfect example of very VERY amazing idea ... which end up being completely garbage...  Short:  Really boring logic game with loooot of searching stupid stuff and almost zero satisfaction (for me) + I finished game in 5-8 hours - I don't remember... There are achievements on playing 20 and 40 hours.... YEA!?  Long: Man! It was so sad!  Playing as a little boy, who is a son of a devil? Making convenient traps? Killing people? Wow! I really want to play this game, mommy!  NAH - it is soooo boring... We have 0 choices - we must kill exact as the game want us to do it. We must find / use the exact ducking (usually) small thing to trigger the events / the guide-notebook. Our powers are trash - they are just for triggering things mentioned above.  I hoped for some free play after completing 50% of the game. Then after 75%... maybe after 100%? Nah... I can't leave house and make a killing spree...     At least screenshots are nice?
1061	Pretty good game to kill time with. Decent graphics, many possibilities. It has it bugs/glitches but in the end is really entertaining. Strong 7/10 for me.
1062	:)
1063	Good game, very funny but a bit broken sometimes in terms of design and how the game gives the player clues about what to do. Play it with another person until you both make Lucius own the house! Bahahahahahaa! 
1064	What feels like a should-be fun sandbox murder game ends up being a bunch of one-solution puzzles of murder. Would be improved exponentially if there were more possible ways to go about solving each problem. Still, it's a really interesting game, just not one that gelled with me.  You can watch our attempted playthrough here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoQVsov5Zk0 
1065	I thought this game would be good...But i can't say much because i got stuck on the first level so i'm not going to give a negitive review..yet. WHY WON'T IT LET ME BREAK THINGS OVER HIM AND HURT HIM?
1066	If you liked the movie 'The Omen' you will enjoy Lucius because it is basically the same premis. Creepy with a few jump scares but mostly milder horror/gore. I realy enjoyed playing the game and knocking off the characters one by one in increasingly elaborate designs. The 1980's graphics/coloring also made me feel like I was watching 'The Omen' and added to the overall feel of the 1972 setting
1067	so dissapointed the fact that it doesnt run n mac, BUT AMAZING
1068	TL;DR for lazy people: Boring, confusing, horrible stealth mechanics. Decent story.  This game sounded a whole lot better on paper than it is in practice. You're a creepy mute kid who is apparently the son of Lucifer and you have to kill everybody in your house so your father can have souls, using diverse methods to knock off your targets one by one while making it look like an accident.  Unfortunately, finding how to do it is a hassle, there's only one way to kill each target and it's not always obvious. there are few clues and if some of them are usually simple and clear, you never know where to find the item, you have to search a huge, confusing manner to find said item and use it. Even after you found the thing, it's not always clear where and how you're supposed to use it. This game doesn't hold you by the hand.  Despite those problems, the game is rather interesting to follow as some drama starts because everybody's stumped and the detective in charge has no idea how all these deaths happen. But then comes ... The Betrayal. The one chapter that manages to ruin what little fun this game managed to offer. You have to cause a power outage so you can sneak around to get in the garage, which is on the ground floor, on the absolute opposite of your starting point. Here, you have to contend with locked doors and horrible stealth mechanics that barely work coherently. you can't see a thing but you don't dare use the flashlight in case this game actually makes you easier to spot when your light's on. All you do is try just about every door in the frickin' house while avoiding the adults patrolling with flashlight for no obvious reasons while your remaining satanic powers are drained because you manage to get spotted by someone who's at the far opposite of you in the corridor or by people you couldn't see or hear and open the exact same door you were planning to open.  This, this is what killed the game, that was barely alive in the first place. It'll probably end up being one of those curios I bought for a buck that I'll never finish, let alone re-install and that's too bad 'cause I'm rather curious about how the story ends. Oh well.  
1069	Good fun. Look forward to playing more of it. Fun for all those who enjoy puzzle-y type games.
1070	I really enjoyed this game. The game itself looks great and I love the story. One of the best games I've gotten from the Steam sales. I would recommend it to other people.
1071	Before you buy the game, please not that it is VERY HARD. There are many components you have to think of before killing each person. Unless you look up a walkthrough/playthrough/guide, it is going to be difficult.  That being said, this game is also good, and it feels like you've actually accomplished something once you've completed on of the components. So, here is a crisp list of pros and cons to help you decide if you want to buy the game or something.  Pro: Gameplay It's very important that your gameplay is a pro, that is a MUST with the community, And luckily for Lucius, it actually has unique gameplay that is quite good at the same time. You really have to think and explore, which not a lot of video games take the time to do these days.  Pro: Amount of Content There are around 16 puzzling levels that feel like a game in themselves. And if you're a completionist like me, there are many achievements for you to collect. All of which aren't to difficult but aren't easy either.  Con: Unpolished The game feels like it's in beta, with the slighlty (quite slightly) long load times and the unsynced voices. It just feels slightly unpolished and could use that extra push to get it to the finish. I also ran into some door glitches on my joutney through the game.  Con: Tutorials The game doesn't do the best job of explaing things. Pure and simple.  Pro: Story Good enough story to make you acrually want to kill people. You don't really care about the people that you're killing, Which in a sense is actually GOOD. Becasue it makes you feel like a cold hearted killer.  Overall: Lucius is worth the full price. There are better games around it's price, but Lucius feels good enough to be worth the price. I got it for 1,45 when it was on sale, and it was extremely worth it.  Also Tom's â¥â¥â¥ is 10/10.
1072	I HIGHLY recommend playing this game! If your not sure it's right for your taste's though maybe you should watch PewDiePie on Youtube play it.
1073	Have you ever felt like murdering innocent strangers or even your whole family?  Have you ever wanted to be an evil, satanic 8 year old? Have you ever wanted to be in a cult?  Well, now is your chance. Play as a satanic, ungrateful little â¥â¥â¥â¥ who slowly murders everyone around him because he is part of the cult.  This game is recommended if YOU have ever wanted to fulfill YOUR dream of becoming Satan.  
1074	pro  - cool idea - big house to explore - music  cons  - Theres no hints where to go or what to do. - Damm big house gets boring when u have to wander around it over and over again. - Laggy - Glitchy - cant kill how u want  Buy it on sale, otherwise i dont recommend it. Liked it from the start , but after like 2 hours im ready to abandon it gets so boring.
1075	This game has me just thinking woah the whole time. The idea that a little kid has powers from lucifer and kills people, while having time to take out the 'trash.'
1076	REALLY FUN GAME has a few issues but still fun game
1077	.
1078	Completed 02/08/2016.
1079	The controls made this almost unplayable, I wish I could have used my controller though it would have only helped slightly. You move so slowly and if you try to run it goes crazy which makes manuevering around very hard and disorienting. I saw potential but I can't play this game with these controls...
1080	I would have loved to play it however I can't due to a slow computer, I would love to know if they are working on a mac version and if they are when that would be released.
1081	Truly a messed up game. You play Lucius, son of Lucifer in a house of people who were once your family. You need to kill them all for Lucifer to harvest their souls. Maids, chauffers, deputies, family, no one is safe from this messed up 6 year old. It's a VERY linear game where you need to kill people in a certain order and a certain way for a scripted event. Some deaths are very gruesome like the nailgun to the back of the head. It's a very mature game that's almost a puzzle game. A very interesting take on The Omen film. It's not a great ache but it's not bad. It's 20 very short chapters, will take you no less than 7 hours to finish this game. If you just want something to hold off your satanic killing/assassinations... this is a decent game.
1082	666/666
1083	Recommended. You are a child who are just turned into 6 years old, and you will receive a 'guest' during your birthday. You will then slowly learning, and control your evil power which is bestowed/awaked from that guest.   This game is very puzzled though. Some clue might appear on your note book. I only plaued and completed chapter 2 (during this review) and it was a good game, and satanic.  7/10 for now.
1084	This is such an evil game...I LOVE IT!
1085	This is a very linear game and there is only one way to kill each person.
1086	In the first chapter, you murder someone and meet the devil. In the second? You get stuck trying to figure out what to do for an hour and told to pick up your room and brush your teeth. I plan on coming back to this game eventually, but I wasn't very impressed.
1087	So I'm not one to play games with a linear storyline from beginning to end. But Lucius was one of those games, though could use some work, had me entertained throuhgout... I mean how often can you play the son of the devil and go around killing people?   I do recommend this game and even though it's not a huge game it's still very enjoyable.  I did a full playthrough of the game, just in case you get stuck at some points. Here's the first episode to taste what the game has in store for you.   https://youtu.be/yeizmSoOvsM   
1088	Wow... This is a hardcore scary number one indie game!!
1089	  Well this game, is kind of complicated,altough it's really satisfing, the moment when you get all the puzzel's pieces and finish a level. This is a game for a vast mind, and a lot of thinking. I really reccomend this game.
1090	Good game it teach me how to be a psycho and how i feel to be a son of demon
1091	Old but gold I rate 666/69
1092	Recommended, if it's on sale or bundled (and if you haven't watched a 'tuber play through it first as there won't be any more surprises for you.)  As others have said, it's just linear progression with only one solution for every stage, like an older point and click adventure, While it was fun enough on first playthrough, some parts of the game seem to hold your hand only to then suddenly push you down the stairs. Though only once did I have to check a walkthrough thinking the game had bugged. (It hadn't. An item was easily missed.)  You're offered three profiles when launching the game. I played through once, unlocking every stage (all in one location, a mansion) while paying no mind to inventory items. Started fresh using the second one after learning once you acquire a certain weapon early then complete the level, it will stay in your inventory for the subsequent ones. This is where I got most of my enjoyment from, failing over and over again because I found it simply hilarious to murder every NPC. This would sometimes cause ragdoll bugs for them that were almost as terrifying as the in-game death sequences. Several death scenes left me aghast as they're fairly well done and I hadn't seen footage beforehand.  I stopped playing just before the 20-hour achievement as it'll give me a bit more incentive to play again in the future. Earning the 40-hour 'chieve w/o cheating it is right out. With the Lucius de-make coming, some people might take another look at this game and I felt it warranted a bit of warning. If you have fun with that game, it might be best to leave it at that as the story and puzzles look to be truly identical. At least low-end PC users will get a chance to play now. I'm hesitant about purchasing said 'demake,' hoping the devs use that potential income to fix Lucius II, a game I'll never finish in its current state because I'm not into masochism. That said, I still hope to see more offerings from Shiver Games and (besides mocap and audio,) their staff of three.
1093	Its a pretty good game. I finished it in about 7 hours.... (the rest was just in idle to get achievements). It has some bugs still, and maybe its my computer but the graphics are alittle wonky at some points. Either way, it was a fun game, and I'm glad i bought it.
1094	i like trains but this is good game
1095	The kid looks like a complete douch but the game is actually pretty fun.
1096	Killing people the the anti-christ with mind powers is fun &lt;3
1097	  Now now, who doesn't like to brutally murder some people? I surely awakens that little devil that's hidden deep within you~
1098	  Lucius is a game about a little boy who's a son of a  â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ lucifer. One of the best indie games ever seen, even the optimization is good. Worth buying anyway.
1099	  This game is quite hard to put down. On one hand, it has a good feel, like a horror movie, on the other hand its annoying and repetitive. The puzzles are easy, there is no problem solving them, the murders are very graphical. There is a sex scene with a fat guy banging a maid, there is peeping on another maid when she takes a bath... everything seems to be in place but I wish it wasnt so linear. It has no replay value, takes like 5h to complete it, but there are achievements for playing it for 40 hours. I mean, no clue what the point of that is, but I'm probably gonna get it just by afking in game. I'll give it a thumbs up but only if you didnt pay for it more than 5â¬
1100	If you ever dream to be that demon lovechild no one ever wanted and a bunch of fanbases scattering around to praise your mighty-ness whatevs, at least Mr. Lucifer is your father.   but mom hates you dad hates you your servants hates you grandpa hates you police hates you.  10/10 recomend. 
1101	10/10 The Omen: The Video Game 
1102	Lucius reminds me of Hitman: Blood Money; you have a target, now find the best way to kill them. Generally I enjoyed the game dispite it being released in 2012. The game starts off by explaining that since it's your birthday you inherit the unholy powers of your father(the devil). Through out the game you must kill poeple in the manor to gain more abilities. Each chapter, you find your target and are given hints on how to kill them; the way some characters die in the manor are pretty grim, from being    crushed by a piano to being shot with a nail gun.    The game is not afraid to show it's true colours. 
1103	It wasn't bad it kept me there for almost 10 hours it has no replayability though. bad powers hard to use control. the whole game is just a big puzzle that has one way and one way only to beat it Can't recommend buying also the soundtracks are annoying as â¥â¥â¥â¥ 
1104	I looked at this game for a long time when it finally got on sale. So I went and bought it. My little brother warned me against getting this game. He said it was bad. I ignored him. I owe him an apology. He told me the controls were hard to work with and the plot was stupid. Lo and behold, the controls were hard to work with. Not at all helped by how the framerate likes to bounce up and down like a hyperactive child in a bouncy castle going through a sugar high. As for the plot and story , I don't know what to telI you on that front because I was too busy having a wrestling match with the controls to find out what the story was.  I was so unsatisfied I requested a refund, which I normally never do to a game that is on sale. I am really disappointed in this game and myself for buying it.  Just go watch one of those 'demonic child movies' I heard about. I'm sure you'll get the same experience.
1105	Hard as â¥â¥â¥â¥ and also for a bagde
1106	KILL YOUR FAMILY KILL YOUR FAMILY KILL YOUR FAMILY   Even if I didn't have the choice of the manner to kill my victims, the game was very pleasant for the sadistic person that I am :D  Satan/10
1107	Reversed some crosses, burned some people, no one suspects anything, I'm just a nice child and surely not suspicous.  Nice story to play, don't check walkthroughs, cause it's too easy then. Buy it, enjoy, kill people have fun.
1108	A really misunderstood kid is Lucius, one of the creepiest kids in games but so utterly, devastatingly adorable beyond measure!!!
1109	Not to bad a bit evil for me so not my kind of game
1110	Now, I've only played a bit of this game, but I would say it's VERY interesting, some parts are a bit difficult, but nothing bad.  I'd buy.
1111	51/100   Buy this only on sale and nothing else to play   Genre: Strategy, gore, protagonist, story Play-time: 5~10 hours  PROS: - Cheap (buy it on sale only) - Achievements are quite easy (buggy tho)  CONS: - Buggy as hell (have to restart sometimes) - Bad controls (played with joystick) - Low fps (my newer games run better) - Useless game hints (at least state whos gonna be the next target!!!) 
1112	First time getting a boner from a horror game.
1113	This game gave me the weirdest boner. Anyone else with me.
1114	  Now now, who doesn't like to brutally murder some people? I surely awakens that little devil that's hidden deep within you~
1115	The game is pretty fun, till it gets to the point where you can't figure anything out without some hints. Still a really cool game
1116	my lil demonic baby
1117	das pretty neat
1118	Amazing game, Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ^^
1119	You play as Lucius a little boy who receives orders from the Devil himself ordering you to kill various people in the mansion in where you live.  In order to do this you will have to roam the huge mansion in search of items which you can use. Figuring out which items to use on a person and how to perform the execution without being caught can be tricky and you will have to use your brain to figure out the best way.  Overall a pretty fun game grab it when it's on sale, it only takes around 9 hours to complete and the achievements are easy.
1120	im on â¥â¥â¥â¥in rampage
1121	Ready to play the Omen, I mean, Lucius? Learn powers that you'll literally never use until you're told to and kill people in so many limited ways! Thinking of a creative way to pick off the maid? Well stop that right now! You've got to do it step by cryptic step. Half the time you won't know what you're looking at/for!  Ready to be sucked into an in depth world filled with emmersive characters? What are you doing here? There's none of that! You have an uncle and more than one maid! If you say you knew you had an uncle before chapter seven you're clearly lying.  Who can forget such amazing dioluge like 'Now Lucius don't forget to brush your teeth. Don't make me tell you again.' And 'Now Lucius don't forget to brush your teeth. Don't make me tell you again.' Your mother won't say anything else to you so you better brush those teeth (teeth brushing optional)  11/10 would walk in on uncle again.
1122	This game that put a smile on my face. ( ï¾ â ï¾ )
1123	I enjoy playing this game if i got nothing to do and this game should definitely won the 'Villain most in need of a hug' cause even tho lucius is the main char i feel he is also the villain XD and yea lucius wants to be hugged or wants to have attention from his father.
1124	  Playing as the six year old son of the Devil (like in The Omen) was really fun. Similar to Hitman: Blood Money, the levels are big and the objective is to find ways to kill your target. Unlike Hitman, you can't just pull out a gun and kill them if you can't figure out a way to stealth it, making it more of a puzzle game than an action game.  The deaths are all amusingly gruesome, with good graphics and a soundtrack that sounds like Danny Elfman. It's a bit buggy but the missions are short so restarting them due to a glitch isn't a big deal.
1125	For when it is discounted by atleast 60%, i'd suggest buying it for a fun little mess around when all your other games dont seem to be filling your needs. Great GAME but only worth it on discount!
1126	Not to bad a bit evil for me so not my kind of game
1127	After playing this game i literally googled 'how to make a pact with satan'.. The game has nice storyline and convinced me I could be the decendent of lucifer (praise be to him) himself.. Anyone who loves to manipulate peoples' life and be the cause of their suffering then play this game..Finished it in a few days though with some walkthrough help..
1128	reminds my of a horror move and as a 'expert' horror movie watcher as myself i realy appriceated the story line along with the pulling attraction of suspence 8/10 
1129	First time I finished Lucius it was cool, but on second time it wasnÂ´t bad but itÂ´s not game you would like to play many times...  but I canÂ´t say anything bad on it  so 10/10
1130	Zombie Driver is the same for the top-down car racing games as Zombie Shooter is for the isometric style action-RPGs: mindless fun offering you hours and hours of entertainment while ridding the world of a horde of zombies!  You play as a taxi driver who is entrusted by the government to complete certain tasks during a zombie outbreak. The story is nothing special but some of these missions can be very exciting - sometimes you can use a tank to just destroy everything that's in your path but even with the taxi cab mowing down hordes of zombies can prove to be satisfying.  While story mode can get really boring (you should mainly play it for the money) Survival Mode puts you in a much smaller area and makes you the target of never ending zombie waves. The longer you can survive the higher score you can achieve and you can compete with your friends on the leardboards.  Furthermore, in Blood Race you have the opportunity to compete against other drivers controlled by the A.I.   This game offers long-lasting, solid fun! You have machine gun, rocket launcher, flame thrower and even a rail gun at your disposal to wreak havoc!  This is a highly recommended game!
1131	I used to wonder what the big woop about this game was. Now I know. You get to mow zombies down- in a car- with machine guns- and rockets- and flamethrowers- and spikes. Nuf' said.
1132	If lavender tea and deep breathing don't help after a bad day, try this. Mixed with the proper metal this game's survival mode is a great stress reliever. Plus, it throws out achievements like candy making you feel like even more of a rock star. I sat down planning to spend 30 minutes killing some zombies...I walked away 4 hours later feeling as if I had been at a day spa.
1133	Pretty much the same thing as the non HD version so definitely not worth getting unless you can get it really cheap in a indy bundle which is just exactly how I acquired it. As far as I've noticed all it really adds is some boss monsters in the single player stages. That's about it.  If you don't have the original though it's a nice drive and gun game with some cool extra modes that's recommended if that sounds like your kinda fun.
1134	Played a few levels, this is AWESOME. No clever jokes, no 11/10 would blah blah, it's great, buy it.
1135	For those who just want some mindless random fun this is it. It's a simple but hard to put down game. Always a joy to run over hordes of zombies! ;)
1136	In ZDHD, you are Joe Citizen who, for reasons unknown and never really explained, has been recruited by the military to conduct a series of combat, scouting, and search-and-rescue missions. The first ten or so story missions of Zombie Driver HD were fun and the last twenty-one generally vacillated somewhere between tedium and entertainment, with a couple of teeth-grinding exceptions. Most of the components of a good game are here, but none of them stand out in any way, which makes the whole more-or-less precisely the sum of its parts: a mediocre story, weak voice-acting, decent but not remarkable gameplay, nice car models and (mostly) destructible terrain, and some value-added game modes.  Your missions start with briefings, like the one shown above, after which you select a vehicle and buy any upgrades that you can afford based on what youâve unlocked so far and how much cash youâve earned from completing objectives or finding money stashes. ZDHD is one of those top-down games where you never get out of your car. The variety of vehicles, ranging from your starter car, a taxicab, to a giant armored vehicle with a 10-passenger capacity, is fairly impressive, but when you dig into the game youâll find that youâre really only using one or two of the vehicles in your garage, generally a compromise between carrying capacity (most of your missions involve rescuing scientists, first responders, or civilians with special skills such as pilots) and durability.  The upgrades available for your vehicles fall into two categories: weapons and modifications. Modifications affect a specific vehicle only and are these: armor, speed, and ramming (the last of these represents a vehicleâs ease of turning intact infected into smears of roadkill). Weapons include such items as machine guns, rocket launchers, flamethrowers, and a rail gun, each of which has three power level upgrades. Weapons are provided in the form of âpickups,â meaning that you drive over a weapon to equip it and only one may be equipped at a time.  What story there is in the campaign unfolds largely through the mission briefings and monologues by survivors that you pick up and bring back to base. No explanation for what caused this breakout of zombie-ism is forthcoming although itâs evidently some kind of bio-toxin, and the military has you picking up various groups of folks to assist in containment and control efforts. Many of these groups will question (as you, the player, no doubt will) why the military is sending a lone, untrained civilian to perform these dangerous tasks and some will hint that the military is somehow behind the zombie plague, but whether these are the ravings of a paranoid few or glimpses of the truth is never made clear.  Once youâve completed (for me after about 10-12 hours) or gotten tired of the story mode, there are two other single-player modes to explore: Blood Race and Slaughter. The Slaughter mode is basically a horde modeâyou have one vehicle and you pick up powerups and kill as many waves of zombies as you can before your car is destroyed. Blood Race felt a bit like a less-fun version of Death Rally: you compete in a marathon of eight events composed of âeliminatorâ (destroy a target number of enemy AI vehicles before time runs out), âenduranceâ (survive as long as you can with a bomb on your vehicle by passing checkpoints to add time to the countdown), and âraceâ (what it sounds like). The race sections arenât really up to DR because destroying an opponent only takes him out of the race for as long as it takes for him to respawn and most of the tracks are very curvy. Even using a gamepad, the steering for most vehicles is very slippery, so sliding around corners isnât really an option for novice racers.  If you like top-down driving games and hate zombies, you may enjoy Zombie Driver HD. Itâs not a great game but itâs not a terrible game and thatâs about the best faint praise I can give it.
1137	If you liked driving around and killing people with your car in GTA 1 &amp; 2, you might take a pleasure in playing Zombie Driver. You've either got a machine gun, a flamethrower, a rocket launcher or a railgun mounted on your car. You even can choose your vehicle, e.g. a taxi, a sports car and not at last a tank in story mode. Beside the story mode, which is not that challenging, there is a racing called Blood Race and a survival mode called Slaughter. All of those are fun and the game itself is just about fun, it is certainly not a high-class game. Despite the variety of three playable modes, the game is rather short. Nonetheless it is worth buying, especially on sale.
1138	English (US) Nice history campain mode, you play as a mercenary hired for the military to aid in the zombie elemination, it is very simple and funny, looks like the old jungle strike series, however the race campain mode is terrible, it does not work proprely, your car reacts different every time it touches the wall, so its more about luck than player ability.  PROS: - Fun n simple - Lots of cars - Lots of upgrades  CONS: - Very repetitive - Race mode is terrible   Portugues (Brasil) O modo historia Ã© muito bom, nele vocÃª joga um jogo de carro de aÃ§Ã£o, bem simples e divertido, no estilo jungle strike, agora no modo corrida, o jogo simplesmente Ã© podre, nÃ£o depende da habilidade do jogador e sim da sorte, pois cada hora seu carro se comporta de maneira diferente.  PROS: - Divertido e simples - VÃ¡rios carros e armas. - Upgrades dos carros e armas  CONTRAS: - Bem repetitivo - Modo corrida Ã© pÃ©ssimo.   Nota 6/10
1139	-ZOMBIE DRIVER HD REWIEW-  This game is not bad.There is long Story Mode Stages and Blood Race Mode Cup events to get some action and Slaughter Mode to teste your drive ability and experience in this game.If you have gamer soul you can't get bored while playing this game.  Different Cars to drive and you can upgrade them that sounds good.Also you can try to reach high rank at leaderboard on all stages and modes like you want but i need to warn you i said ''if you have gamer soul you cant get bored white playing this game''before.Yea its true but this game is kinda slow like not a normal race game or different category car game maybe cause it's a 2nd person strategical driving game that makes it slow i think  So is it worth to buy it? Maybe yes or no but you can try it anyway if you liking to climb leaderboards in different games   Drive to your best score Good Luck :)  My General Point To This Game:5/10
1140	The objective of each level is to navigate the vehicle through the confines of the city while completing missions and killing Zombies.   PRO:
1141	Suddenly it's a very nice game. I'm shocked, lol. Dynamic racing action, blood, gore, zombies and interesting car upgrades. Cool.
1142	So close to being an awesome game. Manic zombie killing vehicular apocolypse, but the six inch visibility means hitting every wall in town, and the ten mile turning radius means each kill is annoying to go back for, and the two seconds of ammo capacity means guns are a pipe deam, combined with unskippable bad voice-acting... so close to awesome, but not quite.
1143	Tons of fun, and easy to just pick up and go. Dont have a lot of time, but need a few minutes of game time? Most of these levels only take a few minutes to complete. It is, however, hard to put down once you get started. Well worth the $.
1144	Good fun couple of hours  Like a hooker, but cheaper.
1145	Fun medium-sized game with detailed graphics, different from others of zombies because has vehicles as main weapons.
1146	Buy it! but beware of motion sickness if you suffer from it.  It is a top down driver shooter, where the camera will constantly swing around as you turn however it is great fun if you don't mind gta 1 type top down driving, had the game on the xbox when it first come out glad it's on steam now.  playtime might not appear like ive played it much but just was trying it out to see if its changed much since i last played it and nope im still a little bit dizzy but i'd still recommend the game for sure!
1147	Much fun to play through the storyline and the arcademode, trying to get better highscores. Most satisfying topdown and car-driving game to kill zombies. Maaaaany zombies. And so much stisfying gore :-P  Ever heard like a railgun slices through a mass of zombies big like a footballfield? No? Get the game then ;)
1148	People are often surprised about the amount of time I devoted to this game. The concept is not very complex here - you drive around, smashing zombies and surroundings, sowing destruction and collecting upgrades to your car and momey to buy even more upgrades.  Can this game be any good? Definitely! It's one of the games that I spent most time playing. It has some storyline, but it's not the reason you play this game, is it? I play it when I feel the need for speed and destruction without excessive brain exercise. In fact you can freely relax your brain in this game, you will be using your eyes and fingers, but won't need to plan any complex strategies. But when you play a game that is all about driving into hordes of zombies, can you expect anything else?
1149	(Updated 29/10/16) ... Added Video.  There are two fundamental flaws with this game...  1) It's not multiplayer. I say flaw because if this game was multiplayer, I am pretty confident none of us would ever play another game ever again except this one. Explosions, endless bullet spray, flames...flames at the corner of my brain, fodder, more flames and a laser which basically just punches a hole through an entire city block. Now all that control in one mans hands is fun, place it in three, have a timer and endless enemy spawns and you have a pixelated armageddon catering for an endless maniacal laughter.  2) There is a scientific equation law here which is never broken. The equation is this... Zombie + Speeding Car = Tomato Sauce. Problem is not everyone likes tomato sauce. Some like Bbq, others go for mayonaise, some like wasabi and some boring people dont want any sauce at all. Since the developer/s do not want to limit their audience they should really provide an option in game where you can either change color of sauce, or even have the option of 'no sauce'.   Maybe modders can come to the developers rescue on the second point since the game has been completely opened up for them to run mayhem. Personally i like to place several sauces at the same time on my fodder, so give me white, red, green, in fact even make a rainbow sauce please so i can really paint the town.  Basically the story mode is rather linear in the way it plays out like carmageddon, so that you run over various zombies picking up people from various locations in the city. Each time you pick someone up you get treated to a small dialogue of the story which more often than not pokes a bit of fun at itself and the zombie game genre providing some laugh out loud moments. But it does become a bit stale after a while because most of the levels are basically the same thing over and over. You just grind away making money so you can buy more cars and upgrades.   Most of the zombies really do the same thing, they just cause your car's health meter to go down when they hit it while your standing still or if they throw a projectile at it. It doesnt take much intelligence to find the zombie spawn points which are usually a converted zombie bus, or a massive zombie hive and blow it up first. There is one zombie which really is a major pain though and thats the fat zombie, which is somewhat parroted from the 'boomer' in 'left for dead' if he gets close enough to your car he will explode causing massive health damage to your car if your still within his blast radius.  The HD graphics in this game are TRULY AMAZING. I found myself a number of times just parking and looking at the beauty around the place regardless to the fact that I was being pounded into the concrete. I just had to look at the houses and green houses and go 'isnt that pretty, go away zombie leave me alone i'm admiring this flowering bush'...  The other grand mention of this game are the two other modes. This is where the game REALLY shines.   First there is a Slaughter mode where its your job to last as long as possible driving around a small map collecting upgrades and money as the waves of zombie spawns slowly get worse each round. There is an achievement to last for 30 waves. This is really challenging and more often than not personally found that my car was exploding into tiny debri even around wave 10. Place this mode in multiplayer and it would be awesome.  Second there is a tournament mode. The tournament caters three events. 1) Blood race. Race around a track against challenging ai racers poling for first position. 2) Endurance mode. Race around a track by yourself, trying to hit the checkpoints in time against a devilish timer. 3) Elimination mode. Race and blow up as many AI cars as possible.  Again if all this was in multiplayer it would bring back the feeling of the good old days of 'rock and roll racing' google it.  Seriously enjoyed the graphics and the fun of the modes, just really, really wish it was multi player and could turn off that damn red color and change it to pretty rainbows. Still recommend, but if you don't like tomato sauce I would give this one a miss until modders or devs give more options.  Finally here is an interesting video which shows the evolution behind Zombie Driver HD so far...         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Making of Zombie Driver&nbsp;
1150	Simple premise - zombies have resulted from a large explosion at a corporation trying to cure cancer, and everyone is infected. You are a talented driver (I guess) and you are recruited to help out the army as they try to evaculate or establish a base. Missions are fun, fast and filled with satisfying gibbing of zombies everywhere. Typical mission is going to pick up a few specific survivors to help build the base (Doctors, Shipcrew, etc) or going to defend a specific objective. There are secondary objectives, and the game does a good job of mixing up the mission objectives.   Simply put, this is a great game to sit back and relax with, slamming into a billion zombies. I have only played the Campaign so far, but there is two additional modes to the game! Really excited to dive in further. Absolutely worth the price paid.  TLDR; Fantastic fun arcade driver game, in the vein of Carmageedon and others. Splatter zombies, equip and upgrade vehicles. 8/10
1151	Surprisingly fun! I didn't expect much from a game where you just drive around the whole time, but through fitting audio, brutal animations, powerful weapons, massive zombie doom-bringing tanks, and fast paced action, this game makes mass zombie squishing extremely satisfying. 'Slaughter', a wave-based survival mode, brings all of the weapons to your disposal early on, like the super powerful railgun, making normally repetitive zombie smashing very enjoyable.
1152	This game is like the original grand theft autos with zombies so you don't feel guilty for flattening them. It's a fun game worth the money. N.B. Recommendation moved from the 1st one as this is simply a better version with a race mode like death rally, and it's in HD...
1153	Never played the original, so no comment on how this is or isn't a dev/pub cash-grab, but this game scratches that car combat itch. Lots of repetitive zombies and sound effects (and poor voice-acting), but the positives are a nicely-bombed-out lookin' city, and a good range of cars and weapons at your disposal. The different game modes (story mission, racing, and survival) help mix things up, and a bunch of not-unreachable achievements is always a bonus.
1154	Great game! Like carmageddon, just with zombies :)
1155	I like the game, fun to kill Zombies.. light &amp; good time pass.
1156	Zombie Driver HD as the title says is a game about driving. And the problem of driving game is that most of the time they gets boring real fast. I like that game, the music is good, the graphics are pleasant enough but there are lacks of variety. You just spent 90% of your time to go pick some guys up or to destroy something. That's the main problem of the game. Another problem is the scrolling speed. When you pick a fast car and if you use turbo it is going too fast and you don't see well what you're doing and where you're going.  However, I still find this game fun. It's a no brainer, that's why and I like the idea of blasting away zombies with a mounted minigun, laser, rocket on a taxi,bus,limousine etc. But one thing I don't recommend is to buy it full price.
1157	Pretty fun game to pass some time reminds me alot of the game Carmageddon for N64 when I was younger.
1158	Buying this game on sale, the complete HD edition I might add.  I don't need to play this for very long to realize that this is a brainless fun game. If you like that Baldurs Gate camera view, vehicles armed Flamethrowers, rocket launchers and gatling guns all in the name of cauasing mass zombie genocide combing mbloodier kills for a higher score multiplier.  Then this is your game.
1159	So far for my first 30 minutes this game trows me instantly into a zombie mess, after that there is no tutorial (-1 point) and you must learn the controls from the settings, the game mecanics are impresive plus the graphics are good enough and working good witht the blood decals, the weapons are ranked to bad to better like the flametrower, can do some damage to the big zombies but not for a long range but shorty it will ran out of amm and than we have the rocket launcher that has low ammo but massive damage and explosive radius. Upon this game basics, this gem brings you car and gun upgrades, not so good because they kinda are unlockables and that means they can be unlocked trough the story, the enviroment is very fascinating plus that weather and day/night system makes it look even gorgeous and they couldn't just leave the game only with zombies by their selves, they added freaking BOSS fights, the controls may not be that easy while trying to aim your weapons but it's worth the try.  I feel like I haven't payed enough for this game, still haven't enough money in wallet xd. 8/10 will run into zombies if I had the chance in real life, wish me luck.
1160	I'd call it gta 2 where you can only be in a vehicle.     Its OK. That really sums it up.
1161	If you ever wanted to drive a tank during a zombie apocalypse, then this game is for you!
1162	Although it is very repetative, you get a good feeling when you drive through a horde of zombies. Each and every time.
1163	Pretty damn good top down driving game in GTA 1 and 2 style. If you liked the original GTA style driving games, this is just like them, only with content and graphics like they were made today. It also reminds me a lot of the old APB arcade game.
1164	Really fun game driving round killing zombies in a kitted out killing machine of a car, good if you just want to play something fun for a while to pass time, after a while gets abit repetitive but its good as a time waster.
1165	love this gane and it fun to play
1166	Drive, kill, blood, guns, big guns, bigger guns, zombies. And they give us a free update that made the game look better and add more zombies on screen. So there is a lot of zombies And a lot of fun!
1167	Enjoy it for what it is.   It's an isometric fast paced zombi shooter on wheels. You get your upgrades, new vehicles, races, end bosses etc etc.  Not sure if its worth the full price, but under 5 Euro's (if you have a coupon or something) is a fair price in my opinion.  Lets not forget it's fun to kill zombies in wich ever way we can.  
1168	Sooooo much better than the original. This one just feels so much more polished, and fun. There is soo much more detail now. Take my word for it, its worth 9.99 (or 4.99 if you already have the non-hd version)  I will admit, I was a little dismayed when I heard that owners of the original were not getting this HD free. However, after playing it (and getting 50% off to boot) I can see why they had to charge something, they kept what made ZD fun, and added much needed jazz to it.
1169	I'd call it gta 2 where you can only be in a vehicle.     Its OK. That really sums it up.
1170	It's okay. Repetitive and the end missions are stupidly unforgiving though.  It's fun for a while, at least. One to pick up when it's cheap.
1171	Although it is very repetative, you get a good feeling when you drive through a horde of zombies. Each and every time.
1172	Pretty damn good top down driving game in GTA 1 and 2 style. If you liked the original GTA style driving games, this is just like them, only with content and graphics like they were made today. It also reminds me a lot of the old APB arcade game.
1173	Apogees Duke Nukem Death Rally meets Rockstars Classic Grand Theft Auto. Top down car driving gun blazing zombie killing goodness.  Played the original a what seem like 6 ish years ago ?, and to be honest didn't give it much thought, it was ok but found it fiddly with a keyboard and mouse. Skip forward to 2015 and I picked up the ZD HD complete pack for just over Â£2 and have been playing it nearly 5 days now, this time however with an xbox controller.  In short the game visualy looks very nice, easily some of the best 'indie' game graphics available even against 2014/15 offerings. SFX compliment the game well nice solid sounding guns and squishy zombie splatter under the tires. Heavy Metal BGM during the survival mini games gets your adrenalin pumping but is less suited perhaps to the missions of the main game, it is good but can become repetative. Voice acting ... well at least there is some, lets just say it doesnt add nor detract from the game, and I've defo heard a lot lot worse.   Game can be tricky to control with kyb and mouse and is definatly easier to be prescise with a stick controller like xbox/ps3 controller.  Main game offers 31 missions each taking between 3-10 mins to complete on your first play through, each with highscore tables and secondary optional missions offering limited replay value but atleast it has. These can be replayed in any order, using any car you have unlocked with ay upgrades you have unlocked making a replay easier to obtain a better score or to do secondary missions.  Survival mode offers erm.... 7 ish arena maps with the aim to survive as long as possible with waves or increasing numbers and toughness of mobs, earning upgrades each wave to assist you and random weapon and bonus score drops. each map having its own high score tables. This is easily the most fun mode and will keep you playing for significant time after having completed the main game. To be fair some of these maps can feel a little small or tight to move around and can feel like you are just driving in a circle, but most are nice arenas with multiple paths to manouvre around.  Race mode, this is somewhat similar to a classic game Death Rally from the 90s, I havent played much of this so far but is a series of tournaments made up of a set number of events, such as race, checkpoint and elimination. This can be a little frustrating as it is very easy to get stitched up right at the end of an event after leading 95% of a race. This mode seems to be 75% player skill and 25% luck.  Money spent on car and weapon upgrades from the main game are for the main game only, in the main game new cars are unlocked through playthrough. In survival upgrades are earned in each game for that game only by completing waves cars are unlocked in this mode by unlocking them in the main game. In race mode cars have to be unlocked with money, money earned and spent on cars and upgrades in race mode is for race mode only.   I can not comment of the race mode achievements, however achievements for the main game are not difficult to obtain. There is one that you should be aware of before starting your first playthrough which if missed will require a full 2nd replay.... which is probably best as it will be easier with some experience having played the game, and one that will require a little skill and luck and several play throughs requiring to complete last mission with less than 10% health. The survial achievements are easily obtainable and fun to boot. With my limited time spent of race mode, I do not think they will be too hard just frustrating needing several replays that will take time, depending on skill or rather luck.  Perhaps the best thing about ZD HD is whether you have 5 mins to play a game or 4 hours, it will keep you entertained and survival mode will always suck you in for just one more try.  If your paying full price just pickup the main game and the Apocalypse pack well worth the money. If its on sale then buy the complete edition, either way this game is easily a must buy for your collection.   ***EDIT***  Just a quick note, system specs are i7 4500HQ, 16gb, R9 265x and game runs fine at max settings 1080p, a little slowdown ( just dips below 30fps ) at points in a couple of the later missions, no slow down on survival or race modes. Accidently run with onboard 4600HD for the first couple of missions and would be fair to say it handled max settings well around 28-38 fps but would be fair to say later missions would pose a problem given the 265x diped below 30 at times, should be ok on HD or HD+ however with 4600HD.
1174	Running over zombies has never been more fun.  Buy this game while its on sale for $0.99  8/10
1175	A relaxing mindless carnage is the best way to describe this game.
1176	Excellent, fun little game. keeps sucking me in for a few more hours destruction.
1177	Zombie Driver HD..Title says it all Your Driving and Killing Zombies with your car! This game is quite good but sometimes gets boring fast because of standart story mode...There are diferent modes and the best is Slaughter mode I think you must survive as much as possible while zombies are comming and comming! Also you can unlock upgrades for your cars! Flamethrower power, Rockets, Speed, Armor and much more! Get it you wont regret!:)
1178	HD version of the original with quite a few improvements. They've basically fixed everything, and improved the quality of the effects. I noticed slight graphical improvement with the environment, but not much. The dialogue was barely fixed. There were still parts where I was like 'Skip...Skip...Skip...COME ON!' I want to *hick* run this *hick* game into a *hick* wall sometimes...... *hick* Seriously. Drunk people don't do that or sound like that. STOP IT!  Missions were improved, and I don't remember the original having the huge boss fights which can actually be challenging towards the middle of it. I also got the DLC with the car and the truck. The truck helps a lot, but you'll also have to upgrade the dlc car if you want to beat those timed missions with... *hick* time to spare. *hick*  One of the things people wanted was multiplayer, and I'm really hoping to see that in a possible sequel.
1179	This game is really addictive. Very satisfying to drive through hordes of zombies...oh man! You just scratched my paint.
1180	Highly addictive action/racing
1181	It`s a fun game after 8 hours working and you came home play this game 10 min and you feel much better ..   Recomand it ..  
1182	What is there to say about Zombie driver HD that has not already been said?   Coopl story, excellent concept, and easy to have fun with, but hard to master. If you have ever dreamed about racing a taxi with rocket launchers into a zombie mob, pressing fire, and driving through a fireball of epic proportions, then this game is for you.   I would suggest buying an X-box controller for this.   Drink for this game? Mountain dew, mixed with vodka and a dash of lime, with a spoonfull of strawberry jam.
1183	This game is a hell of alot of Fun ! 10/10 on the fun scale ! I like everything about this game..
1184	Haven't played it very much, but so far it seems pretty fun . . . worth $10? No. But if it is on sale for around $3 I would definitely pick it up!
1185	Very fun and easy to play game. Only downside is that it cant be played multiplayer.
1186	This game is a really great new twist on a classic style of game. The old game series where you'd fly a helicopter around, saving guys with your ladder and fighting enemies all over the map as you did little missions.  It's like those old games but with a slightly customizable car selection and zombies. Grab it if you like zombies and see it on sale, it's a very fun smaller title.
1187	I have mixed feeling about this game, overall it's good but not very well done, I'm reviewing it with all dlc available. Edit: I have beat the main story so I think I should update this review   pro : - good music - stunning graphics - ram all zombies and blood everywhere - good game without thinking much  con: - there are not much content in this game so the game feel very much repetitive, I played until the very end of the game and the last 2 levels are very predictable - the survivors that looks like asian has russian accent :D ( I think it was on mission 28 or 29) - feels like mobile game with controller support, i don't know why, but it just feel that way - the plot is kinda stupid, till the endm why a taxi driver do everything and army sit behind desk. I meant the story is pretty much predictable - I hate the zombie that can throw things, i just don't make sense at all, I keep thinking when playing where they get throwable things and able to throw like 50 meters away -- and when there are too many of them and you don't pay attention you will die almost instantly from them  other: - GPU intensive, my notebook was overheated while playing it for hours :D - CPU intensive too starting on mission 25++ - The apocalypse DLC ruins the game because new player like me didn't know anything about the game and we could pick truck monster that was overpowerful for early level.  -   stupid ending, doesn't explain anything    final score 7/10 (it was 6.5) give 0.5 because at least they put something new for the last mission
1188	If you can buy it for a dollar, buy it, you will make 1,50$ with the card, WINNING!!!

1190	A little awesome game which kicks â¥â¥â¥
1191	Zombie Driver HD is a race / shoot game.  Core game play is very nice. Story mode you drive around the city to shoot, race and kill your enemies. Many various of mission to give you hour of fun.  Camera is top/down view only you can adjust this if you prefure a other camere view. Controls feel very good and playing this game will me easy and fun. I still prefure a controller abvoe keyboard &amp; mouse.  Collecting guns and other items for shooting your way though the wave of zombies. Or just use nitro and drive over them !!!!!! Many upgades and new unlocks like new cars.  Good game, nice sotry mode. I give this a 8/10 score. !!!!! 
1192	Running over zombies in a Bugatti Veyron with mounted missiles and guns. Come on! How could you not like it?
1193	Oh how satisfying it is to kill THOUSAND of zombies! Got it on sale for only 1.34 â¬. I think they should've added some kind of a free roam mode but that's just me :)
1194	This game is so fun.I feel so manly as I run over a horde of zombies in a taxi.Get the full version its on sale atm and its worth it.
1195	This game is incrediable! for $9.99 you get a lot of game play, three different modes of play, and a awesome amount of enjoyment!! Buy today!!
1196	Squish zombies. Fry zombies. Shoot zombies. Repeat.  Oh, and you can do it in a sports car.
1197	holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ i just played one hour and i can deffenatly say that this was the best 1 euro that i've spent , its such a well made game !
1198	Man I hope they will release Zombie Driver..... 4k! Get it? EH? Becasue... the reso- uhmm  10/10?
1199	A remastered version of original one with good soundtrack.
1200	fantastic game worth the money 10/10
1201	TL;DR: Take the fun of Carmageddon, the viewing angle from GTA (the original ones) and strap weapons on your taxi and you're good to go on a quest to save the city.  In Zombie Driver (HD) you are some dude who drives a taxi. Military ('if they even are the military', says the random hippie) enlists you to save a bunch of civilians in a zombie infested city. Mow those zombies! Mayor will pay you a bonus for their smashed bodies! Gruesome, silly kind of humour is cultured in the overly dramatized monologues everyone else gets to give you when you meet them.  Zombie driving gets a lot more fun once they strap a machine gun to your car. Later, you'll get equipped with flamethrowers, rocket launchers and even experimental rail guns that shoot blue, helical rays of mass destruction. Not to forget, a tongue-in-cheek car game wouldn't be complete without a turbo booster. Between missions you get to upgrade your cars (new ones unlocked every few missions) and weapons.  There are no surprises in the zombie varieties: in addition to the regular, shambling corpses, there are legions of zombie dogs, wailing slingers of industrial junk, bloated monsters of the exploding variety and of course the hulk. Naturally, it is more difficult to ram the bigger ones and especially in large groups.  Story mode has two kinds of basic missions: 1) taxi missions: go and save people from buildings around the town (usually with generous time limits), and 2) slaughter missions: go somewhere and kill everything. Here,  everything  includes the zombie spawners (introduced by the HD version): enormous Jabba the Hut creatures that blurt out more of the monsters (it figures that these are not your average zombies after all). In addition, there are the awesome cleaning and destroying special missions where you get to drive e.g. tanks, with infinite ammo of course. HD version also has a couple of bosses that add nicely into the game's limited lore.  Story wasn't the strong part of the original Zombie Driver and it has only been patched partly by the HD upgrade. It ends abrubtly but rather appropriately although leaving your contribution vague: it is unfortunately never explained why the army (or whatever they are) needed a random taxi driver to sort their mess.  Two other game modes are more like what the game was designed for: there's the copy of Death Rally called Blood Race (though you can't destroy your opponents permanently) with several different tournaments and challenge missions. Unfortunately, career mode is missing. You'll get money for winning races and can then buy limited upgrades to your car. On the other hand, Slaughter mode is an endless killing spree of perpetually spawning zombies for higher points to show off in the leaderboards. Here only death ends the level.  Game is fun and pretty awesome. However, it is easy to get stuck in corners and sometimes it is not clear what items can be driven through resulting in further stuckiness. Mob spawning can be ruthless and illogical, especially in Slaughter mode: zombies tend not to walk as fast (or at all?) when you are not seeing them in front of you in the camera and the game considers it fair to spawn a group of exploding zombies right behind you when you are reversing.  Despite the few complaints, I can give it thumbs up. Graphics are nice, sounds are not irritating and gameplay is very nice (I used keyboard and mouse). Also, the improvements from the original Zombie Driver are very welcome: e.g. they made booster a separate item from weapons, added a map and made the story mode more interesting with the zombie spawners, bosses and special vehicles. If you have doubts but are interested, you can also grab it on sale for 2 euros or less.
1202	Super Fun plan on playing more
1203	Awesome game!!! Sometimes, it reminds me of Land of the Dead meets Death Race! Lovely blood gore gameplay with tons of achievements to unlock. Graphics is also good. No need of high end gaming rig to run it smoothly. If you like to play zombie killer games with set of wheels, this is the perfect game to choose from. I'll rate this game 10/10. Highly recommended during Sale.
1204	Nice game. Upgrade your car and check how it wil run over zombies. Had a lot of fun playing this one.
1205	Pretty nice 'Carmageddon meets GTA2' kind of game. Also zombies. Nothing more to say. Just a small time-killer. 5/10
1206	Quite a fun and entertaining zombie-slaying car game. It's a top-down view (so it makes it hard to navigate unless you stare at your radar 24/7) action-packed apocalypse slaughtercity of bullets, fire, explosives and plasma. A very entertaining game for when you just want to chill out and blow everything up. And for some reason be satisfied with such a bloodfest.   Well, if you have a huge bloodlust and like cars, then this game's probably for you.  The only con I have for this game is the forced top-down view and the voice acting.
1207	too funny recommended
1208	The game is great. Has the full potential, the graphics and gameplay are doing it.
1209	'It's like Skyrim with Zombie and Car without Skyrim ' IGN  10/9
1210	ZOMBIE. YOU. DIE!! I DRIVE!! Buy it, costs peanuts and plays like a boss!
1211	I payed 2.99 (complete edition) 0.4h on record atm, but i have to say thats totally worth it. Reminds me a little bit a game from '97 IGNITION (lots of hours played on this game xD), similar camera (not because the zombies hehe).
1212	éå¸¸ã«æ¥½ãããæé«ã®ã¤ã³ãã£ã¼ã¬ã¼ã·ã³ã°ã¾ã³ãã²ã¼ã ããã¬ã¤ãããã very fun and easy to play. best indie zombie racing game ever
1213	Great game, i got the DLC for it gave me 1truck for 1$ good deal, very fun!!
1214	its a good game yes driveing is good nice customizeashen (spelled that wrong)     only down side is that there is no graphics lowering so for poor pc`s this is not 4 u
1215	Really fun game.
1216	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing highly addictive, alot of replay value in this game, and rightn ow its only 3 bucks with all DLC, you can't beat that!
1217	Tons of fun and challenge!
1218	Zombie Driver HD is a very simple but yet brilliant game and well worth the cost, it is basically a small 2d zombie driver/killing game in which the aim is to save innocent people from the zombies and get them back into safety and kill many, many zombies overall i would give this game a 7.5/10 for its brilliant planning and gameplay.
1219	The game is fun, simple as that :)
1220	Gore Gore Gore and more Gore Great Fun Game  Nuff Said
1221	This game is a lot of fun.The missions tend to be rescue survivors or destroy this and that or collect this and lastly defend that.However when your on the missions the zombies become quite the pain in the â¥â¥â¥ enough that it keeps you playing. I dunno if I would get this for a $10 but its worth buying the game at whatever price you feel comfortable with. Game is loaded with driveable vehicles and you can upgrade things nicely. If you like some driving plus zombie killing,this game is not a bad fit. Not the best,but good times.
1222	You start off as a humble taxi driver. Then a nuclear plant explodes. Things begin to mutate. And it all goes downhill from there. Which is kinda nice. 'Cause you'll be needing that extra momentum.  (You should totally get this game. It's a new take on an old idea and quite refreshing as well)
1223	Sure, it's another zombie game, but this one is actually quite good! Top down driving and gunning fun, for a good price and a relatively compact gaming experience. I wiped out the original in about 20 hours, so I expect this HD version to give up 40 hours of enhanced and added play.  Tip: if this is still like the original, it might be a good idea to hold off all upgrades in the story mode until you unlock the discounts. Going to find out for myself.  Recommended for single players. 8 / 12
1224	so much achievements!
1225	Love it :)
1226	This game is a load of fun. Needs a lot of work and updates still but hey can't dispute this is entertaining.
1227	So this game is basically Crazy Taxi with flamethowers and machine guns but zombies and random mutant bosses get in your way. There's also a kind of pimp my ride aspect to it with the garage and the spray paint and stuff. I weren't expecting much from this but it's probably actually one of the funnest games I've played lately..
1228	put guns on your battle cars so you can kill zeds while you kill zeds. f#ck yeah!  i loved the original release of this game and the 'HD' steam release is even better.  now there's not only the story mode but also race, destruction race and survival. i focused on the story mode and only played the other modes for the achievements but the other modes certainly aren't bad. it never hurts to have more options to extend your playtime and increase the value of the game.  the story mode includes quite a lot of levels and they offer a decent variety of missions and side missions. plus you can finish the missions and still drive around for a while to kill some more zeds and increase your reward. with a fine selection of cars and weapons it just never gets boring. the other game modes are pretty much self-explanatory.  there are some DLC for this game but they are not essential and you don't need them for the achievements. i completed the game 100% after little more than 19 hours and it was just as big fun as the original release.  if you like cars and guns and want to kill some time and zeds then you really can't go wrong with this game.
1229	Best zombie game ever on steam just they are $9.99 XD there 1 car i love it so much but money to upgrate that just found money XD
1230	I wonder if GTA1 would could be produced with these graphics.
1231	This game is really fun to play and it is worth the price, which is low anyway. I highly recommend you get it.
1232	I just want to say that I am pleasantly suprised at the fun this game has provided so far. I really didn't expect much going into the demo version when I downloaded it and played it. After playing the demo I rushed over and bought the bundle pack. I would most definantly recommend this game to people who want a break from the high budget blockbuster titles. On a scale from 1-10 I give the game about 8
1233	Pure, mindless, zombie massacring FUN.  Ending's kind of a letdown, though.
1234	Run over zombies, fry them, electrocute them, blow 'em up etc. A brainless, but enjoyable game. Story mode + 2 other game modes.
1235	Someone please mod Mercedes-Benz into the game!
1236	a single player Twisted Metal-style, top-down shooter with everything you could ask for in its genre. thousands of zombies to kill by minigun, flamethrower, rockets, etc or simply just ram and run them over and destructible environments evertywhere. almost a dozen vehicles to drive around with ,over two dozen story missions to experience wtih a variety objectives for each, and 2 additional modes: Blood Race [Racing, Endurance, and Elimanator] and Slaughter [Survival] to keep you playing.
1237	I keep coming back to this game. Great vehicular combat
1238	Look at the bloodstains right there
1239	one of the best games i played, they should make a 3d version of it
1240	  Nice Game... Good Graffics. I Like Play Games with Categorie Zombie... :) Yes... i Recommend for You!!!
1241	Great Game.  +easy Game +Fun +Zombies +Story +Bosses  -Awful Camera Movement, it moves automaticly, but not automaticly in the right way it should/ when you Turn your Car, most of the Time the Camera is â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up you should make the Camera free, so you can move the Camera with the Mouse a little bit
1242	Not bad, not worth much though. unoriginal on top of that.  I'd pay $1, not much more.
1243	I enjoyed it for what is worth.
1244	Its amazing this driver can see with all that blood smeared across the windscreen!  10/10!
1245	you can't play as a zombie and drive a car, don't be fooled!
1246	Awsome game, love cars with guns, and who doesn't like killing tons of zombies.
1247	Best game ever. And a solid amount of gameplay too.
1248	killing Zombies with cars ooo what fun!!!!!
1249	Very good game! Played it for hours and hours!
1250	Pretty good game, haven't beat it yet though. Fun and cheap...the way i like my games.
1251	THIS GAME IS A WHOLE LOT OF FUN I ENJOY IT BY SMASHING ZOMBIES GUTS OUT IN CARS AND ITS WORTH MONEY AND TIME
1252	Drifting an Auroch and got stuck , Dogs at my Armored Truck..  10/10
1253	Honestly, really fun and really well done, a perfect time waster and looks great for a top down driver.
1254	it has zombies and uprades;)
1255	I have Nausea but still I enjoyed the game.
1256	Can't stop playing. Worth more than what I paid for.
1257	Cool enough to keep you busy when you need some blood
1258	Fun single player story line, shoot zombies, drive cars, mmmmk sure...
1259	Arcade zombie slaughtering 2D game,it's one of the best 2D games i have ever played.Definitely recommended
1260	good old fashioned zombie-killah :)
1261	Cheap and entertaining. Nothing special but worth the few cents to pick it up on sale, good for killing time (and zombies)
1262	Fun racing/zombie squashing game. Tournaments are fun, there are leaderboards, achievements and a ton of GORE! In case you like it. Me, I don't, but the game is well-made and enjoy-able. Oh, did I mention achievements? None are broken, so you can 100% this.  Grab the demo to test it out.
1263	This game is suprisingly fun to play. I definitely reccommend it to anyone who likes car combat games, and zombies. Cant forget the zombies.....  
1264	Cool and Bloody Game! :)
1265	WE NEED MORE CARS AND MISSIONS ONLINE GAMEMODES MORE MISSIONS AND SIDE MISSIONS AND MORE PAINT JOBS AND MORE BOSSES AND ZOMBE CLASS MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORE
1266	This game is a lot more fun than it has any right to be. Top-down view, drive around the city (and other environments in the different game modes) and slaughter zombies. That doesn't sound like it should be anything special, but this game pulls it off especially well to make it a fun game.   It's definitely a great little time waster, and definitely worth getting. :)
1267	I like this for a quick thrash. Load up, mash zombies, finish a level and quit.
1268	Not bad. You drive with crazy controls and sometimes feel like your characters drunk half the time.
1269	Is this a good game? Well, you get to run over zombies... which is delicious.  What I am disappointed with though is the people behind this. Instead of just updating Zombie Driver, they went and re-branded the game as HD, updated and improved upon the game with some new content, and sold it for another $10-15.  So while I consider that a crummy move, the game is still good.
1270	8/10 Good. The game is a perfect mix between racing and zombies, simple graphics but magnificent visuals, the missions are great, the zombie killing is intense and a lot of gore. I like this game and it is worth it.  Pros &amp; Cons: +awesome car upgrades. +big map to play in. +long missions. +sooo much blood and gore  -No free roam mode.. seriously, why?? -a few variety of weapons. 
1271	I like this game:) Recently i played on pc and the game i downloaded from windows store but the version is payable. So yee I love this game:)
1272	Not bad at all when bored.
1273	If you like twinstick shooters you should like this, up there with renegade ops.  Worth grabbing with all DLC and its not expensive.
1274	A surprisingly fun game to â¥â¥â¥â¥ around in
1275	Very Nice game to waist some free time on, Online play is dead. no one on.. okay storie line for something to do if your bored, and or if you just like to kill zombies in Style..

1277	Very good game but maybe you can make it better if you want 
1278	Got this game for a song. Was worth singing.  
1279	This is a quick and satisfying game about driving through crowds of zombies. The graphics aren't phenominal but they work for this type of game.  My only gripe is the fixed, top down camera which makes it hard to drive really fast and plan out where you're heading.  If you don't have a lot of time to play videogames, this is great for a quick fix.
1280	This is a very...meh game. It isnt bad, its just it isnt very engaging. You'll get bored of it after level seven. I guess they couldnt pay for voice actors, but for the love of god you could have at least gave a little enthusiasm in some lines. I never thought I could hear. 'Our driver was eaten by zombies.' come from someone who sounded like they were bored out of their mind till now.
1281	Fast,Fun,and zombie gore everywhere!!!!! MUAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA
1282	Brilliantly addicting game, not much thought need to go into driving over zombies. For a couple of quid you can play for hours also which is pretty good compared to most new games.
1283	This game is 10 / 10 no questions ask .
1284	It's a decent game, it's not the best of it's genre but it's a good when u just want some mindnumbing zombie crushing action, its fun to mow down a huge horde of zombies or destroy stuff with the bulldozer, missions get repeatitive tho and their isnt much depth to it other than a really basic upgrade system. but overall its a decent game, worth getting on sale
1285	This remake gives the player everything what a good remake needs to. Better graphics, added gameplay elements with extended storyline (awesome new vehicles and boss battles), while keeping everything what made the original so entertaining, so if you enjoyed the original game or the demo of this version, give it a try!  Also this review was written some time ago and in the earlier version I was complaining about the really frustating (minutes length) loading times, BUT it seems like that the developers have fixed this issue with the DLC releases, so Thank You dev people for not letting this awesome experience be ruined by some stupid glitch. Now I can actually enjoy playing the game without worrying about that loading back the main menu will take effing 5 minutes.  P.S.: You can also drive a tank (not always of course, that'd be way too easy) to wade through the hordes of zombies. If THIS can't convince you, nothing will.
1286	This game is hilariously cheesy! If you like squishing zombies with cars, this game is for you!
1287	Play some heavy metal music, blow a line, and drive really fast over zombies  10/10 would blow again
1288	This game reminds me of the good old days of Grand Theft Auto, back when it was a top down game, based on stealing cars. Anyway, this game improves on that one, because you're mowing down zombies with your machinegun/railgun/bumper. Its short but you get wha you pay for.
1289	Love this game, its one of those that you find yourself going back to over and over again. Killing Zombies in a car, Blood Gore and some really nice graphics make this game just a joy to play.  7.5/10
1290	Great Game Loads Of Fun !!!
1291	A great time killer  oh and it has zombies! Everyone likes zombies don't they........?
1292	Now in HD!!! A simple and fun zombie game. It offers cool upgrades for your vehicles so you might start with an ordinary run-of-the-mill taxi, but you will end with a zombie-splattering-engine-of-doom! Best part is, it's a low price and easy to run!
1293	The camera is a bit dizzying at times and the controls take some getting used to, but the graphics are great and the arcade gameplay is bang on.   It took me two years to figure out that since the game requires you to manually select your video card model from a drop down list in order to wok, upgrading or changing your card after you've installed the game will cause it to break. I manually selected my actual graphics card, and voila, after two years the game finally works. Nobody got back to me and the forums came up dry on this issue. Gave it a bad review at the time because of this.
1294	Zombie Driver doesn't sound like much on paper, but it's actually a very addictive game once you've given it a chance. The gameplay feels like a mixture of GTA1, Twisted Metal and Left 4 Dead. In story mode you get to kill countless zombies by running them over with your vehicle and with whatever weapons you pick up to complete objectives, unlock more vehicles, and upgrades for your weapons and cars. There's two other modes to play as well: Slaughter (survival) and Blood Race.  If this sounds like a mindless game to you, well...it is. But Zombie Driver is really fun in my opinion, and a nice little game to waste a few (or several) hours on. It's also noteworthy that HD made the story mode longer and better as well, with new features like zombie spawns, bosses and new vehicles you get to drive. 4.0/5.0
1295	A lot of fun if you know what you're getting into. Just a top-down shooter/racer. The races didn't interest me, but the campaign was a lot of fun.
1296	Suprisingly fun and addictive game, you can splash hordes of zombies untill you get your satisfaction. For 90c not bad not bad at all
1297	Had a 90% off coupon, so I got the game for $1. Man....what an entertaining $1. I don't even like the whole zombie genre of games. But this somehow managed to keep my attention for 3-4 days till I beat it. The voice overs are hilariously bad, which adds a little humor to this simplistic drive-around-kill-everything game . The game itself is simple and pretty long if you take your time. Really kinda suprised I liked it....Try it
1298	Good game and beautiful game. You must try it! 10/10.
1299	This game is a blast for the most part. Just zombie smashing fun.  Really nice graphics, atmosphere, environments and awesome zombie physics. Cool other physics too.   The main game mode is great. The story is amusing.  The only part I absolutely hated with a passion was the blood race tournaments, and no event worse than the race mode. Every freaking corner or turn just becomes a friggin mess.   The cars don't have the handling to take the insane turns and cornering and you just end up spinning out or getting stuck in some random obstacle. Gotta hand it to them, they didn't ease up one bit. They really put the chaos into those races. I only put up with that madness for the achievements. I got all the steam achievements for this game, phew...  The elimination mode of the blood race isn't as bad, but is still a pain. The endurance mode just has a trick to it.   The real fun though is the slaughter mode. Just endless waves of zombies.  After a while it becomes so dense it's like driving through Times Square on New Year's Eve.
1300	Got this game for a song. Was worth singing.  
1301	Very enjoyable game, it's a top down car based arcade title where you have a story mode, races, and my personal favorite, slaughter mode.   Campaign is you're a cab driver during a zombie outbreak and you complete various missions, races and wipe out hordes of zombies while progressing and unlocking new upgrades/weapons for your vehicle.  Race is pretty much what you'd expect except (fun words to use in sequence) you can blow up your opposition to set them back/eliminate them and there are zombies on the race track.  Slaughter is a mode where you survive/wipe out as many zombies as you can in timer based waves earning weapon/repair/cash (score) drops. Various maps you can unlock based on doing well in previous ones+new cars to unlock via the 3 modes and a score board leads to an addictive 'Beat your/friends high score' mentality of old school games.  I only have less than an hour on the PC version (picked it up for $3.74 on sale) but I have 20+ hours on the xbox one version (paid $15 and don't regret it).  The game runs well on my potato so no complaints there.   Fun way to kill time/hilarious game to watch via broadcasts.
1302	Rating: 7/10  A very fun, addictive game. It seems that driving over thousands of zombies and watching them splatter with full blood and gore effects never gets old! This game offers you just that. The gameplay is the core of this game, as all you get to do is kill zombies (Thousands of them), save survivors and cause mayhem. It's fairly arcade-like, so it's fun for a few minutes at a time. The graphics are not that great, but the game makes you look over it with the amount of blood and gore it throws at you on the screen. It pretty much is a top-down version of Carmageddon, so if you have played the old classic, you're gonna love this. For owners of the old Zombie Driver, this game is some what of a rip off as it doesn't offer you much in comparison - But at a nice discount it's well worth it.
1303	It is a exicting game. If the person who likes car, zombies and guns!!!, well this is the game for you. Upgrade your car to the max while also unlocking new cars thoughout the way.
1304	Nothing like some Zombi guts all over you car.
1305	This game is fun to run over zombies and customise cars.  10/10
1306	This is, in every way, better than the 1st one. I think the previous edition was great but this one is way better.
1307	this game is surprisingly good, i like it. the camera is a bit iffy, but a good game overall
1308	Kill kill the zombie !! A nice drive-in game.
1309	Nice game, wondered what if this game had a multiplayer.
1310	It's currently Â£2.20 for all DLC and the game. Buy it. You won't regret and and if you do.. it's only Â£2.20.   Zombies, check. Vehicles, check. Decent music, not so much. Flamethrowers, check. Machine guns, check.  9/10 so far. No issues and works 'out of the box'.
1311	What better way to learn to drive..... Buy it !!!
1312	Truly an amazing 3rd person zombie game :D i would highly reccomend getting this game :)
1313	Fun for a couple of hours
1314	Great value for money (except that I broke my keyboard and have to buy a new one). Pros: fluid, fast paced, some variety, decent length. Cons: frustrating, some vehicles barely controllable with the keyboard (all or nothing) and others too slow, Logitech gamepad not recognized. I gave up at mission 28 (out of 36) after 3 attempts.
1315	zombie driver HD is an extremely fun game if you just love to kill zombies in really badass ways, like me!
1316	A lot of fun if you know what you're getting into. Just a top-down shooter/racer. The races didn't interest me, but the campaign was a lot of fun.
1317	Honestly, this game is not great but its not bad either. If you just want some mindless top down driver combined with zombies, go for it. It will get tedious over time so I ended up playing a few missions and then coming back to it months later. There are a few different game modes: story, races, etc. each of them are quite good but you will find yourself playing a few hours and getting fed up.
1318	Zombie Driver doesn't sound like much on paper, but it's actually a very addictive game once you've given it a chance. The gameplay feels like a mixture of GTA1, Twisted Metal and Left 4 Dead. In story mode you get to kill countless zombies by running them over with your vehicle and with whatever weapons you pick up to complete objectives, unlock more vehicles, and upgrades for your weapons and cars. There's two other modes to play as well: Slaughter (survival) and Blood Race.  If this sounds like a mindless game to you, well...it is. But Zombie Driver is really fun in my opinion, and a nice little game to waste a few (or several) hours on. It's also noteworthy that HD made the story mode longer and better as well, with new features like zombie spawns, bosses and new vehicles you get to drive. 4.0/5.0
1319	tons of fun blood and pew pew in this arcade style game. love it!
1320	A lot of fun if you know what you're getting into. Just a top-down shooter/racer. The races didn't interest me, but the campaign was a lot of fun.
1321	Nice splattergame! I recommend a controller. Unfortunately, there is no Multiplayer...

1323	Fast,Fun,and zombie gore everywhere!!!!! MUAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA
1324	Brilliantly addicting game, not much thought need to go into driving over zombies. For a couple of quid you can play for hours also which is pretty good compared to most new games.
1325	Awsome game perfect for lovers of zombie killing :)
1326	Play this game its really fun. The title may sound corny at first, I thought the same thing, but its surprisingly good!
1327	Love this game, its one of those that you find yourself going back to over and over again. Killing Zombies in a car, Blood Gore and some really nice graphics make this game just a joy to play.  7.5/10
1328	A great time killer  oh and it has zombies! Everyone likes zombies don't they........?
1329	Fun remake of Zombie Driver and more stuff and vehicles to play and more achievements great game :)!
1330	What better way to learn to drive..... Buy it !!!
1331	Are you looking for a casual game which can help you blow of some steam? You should buy this game. Do you like running over and shooting zombies with armored cars? You should buy this game. Is Zombie Driver Hd on sale? You should definitely buy this game.  This game offers hours of gameplay and satisfying content.
1332	Buy it itÂ´s fun.
1333	Reminds me of GTA 1. That's a good thing. Good controller support. Fun, totally mindless. Worth the voucher price, easy.
1334	Haha, epic fun. Don't expect anything too expansive though, comparable to web games
1335	Finnaly can have guns on my car without having the risk of falling out of the car
1336	Zombie Driver very good game when i thought.If you have a free time definitly you enjoy to spending hours.Basically you have a car and weapons and all you have to do killing zombies with guns or just crush.Story very similar and sounds ok, but gameplay very enjoying.Probably you wont boring this game.
1337	I played this expecting it to be a terrible waste of time. I am actually having a great time playing it. A great way to waste 30-45 minute time periods in between my Counter Strike matches. 8/10.
1338	Very Nice game to waist some free time on, Online play is dead. no one on.. okay storie line for something to do if your bored, and or if you just like to kill zombies in Style..
1339	Buy it and the DLC. Discounted at $2 is an amazing buy if you love tricking out post-apocalyptic cars to kill zombies.
1340	Not bad. You drive with crazy controls and sometimes feel like your characters drunk half the time.
1341	Zombies flood the streets and the city's last hope is apparently someone in a taxi cab.. It's stupidly fun and there's blood splatter everywhere, especially when you mow down hoards of zombies with your vehicle. The view is an overhead topdown kind of view so the camera can be a bit awkward sometimes if you back up too close to a building. The voice acting in this game is also hilariously bad but considering this game doesn't seem to take itself too seriously I'll let that slide. If you like the idea of clearing the streets with a flamethrower equipped limo then this is your game!
1342	It is a exicting game. If the person who likes car, zombies and guns!!!, well this is the game for you. Upgrade your car to the max while also unlocking new cars thoughout the way.
1343	Didn't expect this game to be fun at all, turns out I was completely wrong. This game is a nice small type of indie where you can upgrade your ride as you smash and kill zombies while completing missions
1344	buy this game cause its good.
1345	It's worth the price if it's on sale. I just came back to this game to review it and saw it's on sale for 2.50, so that's a good price. The full 10.00 is a bit high though. Actual multiplayer races would've been fantastic. The dialogue makes me think it was written in another language and translated back to English. Mechanics and the game itself were fun though. I liked the tropical map, in fact, the graphics overall were wonderful! Some levels felt like they were designed to punish you for even trying to beat the challenges set up for you. But you know what? I had fun and I think it's worth it- on sale that is. The assets were well done and woven together, but the story was a mess... my review is as messy as the experience I had.
1346	buy this game cause its good.
1347	Exciting and attractive arcade game, but late-game it seems to seriously lack unique enemy types/hazards/weapons/objectives. 7/10
1348	I thought I was a Taxi Cab Driver during an Apocalyse. Then I picked the Mayor and learned =  Don't eat the Nachos.
1349	More combat rich and much more of a gorefest-ival...see what i did there.  TOP KEK!  not that i'm going to be allowed to say this but...well â¥â¥â¥â¥ing done....
1350	Great game. Can be played casually but can also become quite challenging towards the end.
1351	A very good game with crazy missions and lots of roadkilling the zombies, crazy choice in cars and alot of achievements
1352	This game is still good
1353	Pretty fun little game, its the kind of game you should play in small sessions and not very long ones or it will get possibly repetitive. Its the kind of game you would start up to have some good old fashioned casual zombie killing action loaded with a bunch of fun. Perfect for when you want to vent some frustration/stress. I got it on sale, got the whole package for less than 4 euros, pretty much worth it if you ask me!
1354	A very good game with crazy missions and lots of roadkilling the zombies, crazy choice in cars and alot of achievements
1355	The best top down driving shooting zombie game there is.
1356	  An awsome game indeed. Its too underated.
1357	Imagine Crimsonland, but while driving a car... running over and shooting and burning and exploding millions of zombies. Heaven.
1358	The game is solid for the price point. There are few things about it that are irritating, but nothing major. Just minor nit picks.   A full review for anyone interested can be found here, but the short version is it's worht the $10 dollar price tag if you don't mind lack of any substantial narrative.   https://basedgamer.com/review/2934/zombie-driver-hd-zombie-driver-is-a-decent-way-to-spend-ten-bucks 
1359	Well worth the Â£1 I spent for all the DLC edition.
1360	A really good game its simpale and most important fun in many ways there is few game mods and a leaderboard if you care about being number one , i bought the complete edition because it was on sale -90% and its worth it trust me
1361	worth every 99 cents xD grumpy approves!
1362	I bought this game at a deeply discounted price (around $1, I believe) not expecting much out of it. So I was happy to find that it is actually really fun. It's reminiscent of the first two GTA games - a top down driver where you're occasionally equipped with weapons but always running over crowds of zombies. The music isn't great, so I muted that and played my own tunes. Lots of fun though.
1363	Its a good game if you have a very short attention span and purchase all the dlc. running over zombies for the first 2 or 3 missions is fun but gets old fast.  If you have any kind of motion sickness like i do and get headaches from too much headbob or unoptimized games, skip this title. Not saying this game is poorly optimized, it runs fine. If i didnt get a migrane from looking straight down, and only seeing 10 feet in front of the vehicle then maybe i would consider launching this game a second time
1364	A short- or mid-length (20-40 hours) zombie driving game with several well known elements: - Story Mode (Delivery, Rescue, Elimination, Conquest, Bulldozer, Tank and Fire Truck Mission(s)), overall 30 Missions, all to take place in the same town at one time. - Tournament Mode: (Elimination and Standard Races with elements of NITRO and Super Cars International, Endurance Races against the clock), 6 tournaments with 4,5,6,7,8,6 events respectively (overall 36 single events) - Arena Mode (Endless Mode, Score and Upgrade (Armor, Weapons) driven) overall 10 arenas  Further Features: Three main types of zombies, small (person-like), tall (bully) and fat (poison balloon zombie, sound of detonation reminds of Batman The Movie Mission 4 balloon catching), more than ten cars and three paints for each car available (similarity of cars, two or three standard cars would be sufficient), destroyable environment and thats about it.
1365	Well it's hard to either recommend this game or not. But since the negative things overweigh, I choose to not recommend this game.  The positive things: - Mowing down zombies which explode. Fun! - Bonus for mowing down even more zombies, wohoo! - A game that doesn't need any explanation and is simple.  The negative things: - Driving can be very frustrating, since you very often get stuck on some stupid corners. And half of the time you're maneuvring back and forth and back an forth and back an forth, while insulting the bad controls with a very foul language. I'm from Lower Bavaria / Germany, which makes this even worse. - You never see what's coming, since the camera angles (no matter which one you chose) takes away any sight or fun. - Time limits, time limits, time limits. Of course not every mission has to be completed in a certain amount of time, but it's annoying as hell if you have to. Why do game makers don't realize we hate time limits as much as we hate escort missions? - Most of the time you're searching for a route to your objective, instead of just driving and giving zombies some hell. The map is very confusing and of course your objectives are at the most far end of the map. The military has helicopters, but meh, f--- this s---, let's just send a normal car instead. The city's completely overrun with zombies and world is in peril, but that's fine. A normal car will do juuust fine! - The cars are a joke. I understand that you're beginning slowly with a taxi, a limo, a van, and that every car has its specific speed, passenger seats and maneuvrabilty. Thats ok, because one has to begin slowly. But they are boring and it's not really getting any better. No special cars or anything. The bulldozer and the tank, which are FUN AS HELL every meter you drive them, you're only allowed to use in one, maybe two missions. Yeah, just take the fun away from the player, I don't think he doesn't mind at all. Let's tease him with greatness and bash him afterwards. It's like getting the biggest and most-fun weapon of a game and than losing it forever and never being able to use it again. - The ending. Really? It seems the creators of this game lost any interest or motiviation or had been cut really short in terms of available time. It seems kind of unfinished.  The things that don't matter: - For a simple game like this it has an evolving story. Which doesn't make sense. Because yeah, let's send a taxi driver in a city overun with zombies to get some crucial things, while the bulldozer and the tank and all the military stays at the base. Are you kidding? Why not a person on a bicycle, just to make things interesting? Yeah, take this, zombie! *bashes zombiehead with club*  Things that could make this game awesome: - A camera angle which actually puts some fun and clarity in the gameplay. - More cars / vehicles which also look differently after upgrading. - Cars that feel like cars and not like toy cars or bricks. - The option to buy upgrades before you start the mission. Not finding powerups during the missions. You can include an arcade mode where this is enabled by default, I'm fine with that. But for story mode it's uninspiring and fun-breaking. Even with the upgrades your machine gun only has 300 rounds - if you pick up the flame thrower, the machine gun's gone. Mission briefing, upgrading the car, killing zombies. This should be the way. So what is the problem? One can never concentrate in mowing down zombies. Instead you're constantly on the lookout for said powerups.  Overall, it's a decent little game, which could be an effin awesome game, if they just would have put some awesomeness in it. I did not finish the game and after failing in a mission several times and watching videos of the last missions on YouTube, I'm glad I didn't finish the game. It would be absolutely not rewarding.
1366	Zombies, cars, big weapons and gore. What could possible go wrong? Well, the chunky controlls on both, mouse + keyboard and Xbox controller.  Surprisingly, it's worse with the controller, not with the keyboard.  
1367	good game,louds of blood,,good story,...........but in blood rase mode game is crashing WTF/?????????????????????
1368	Right, well it's miles better than the first one anyway! Which is to say, it's not a great game by any means, but it's certainly... playable.  Basically, y'know Micro Machines: Military Madness? What's that, you don't? Oh, it's this really great (as I remember it) Mega Drive tank racing game! Well anyway, this game is like that game... but not nearly as good. Go play that instead.
1369	I would have avoided wasting 10 minutes, if I had cleared the mission. I would have cleared the mission, if I had killed the zombies faster. I would have killed the zombies faster, if I had a fair amount of ammo. I would have had a fair amount of ammo, if I could aim the car correctly. I would have aimed the car correctly, if I could have controls that aren't clunky. I would have controls that aren't clunky, if the gameplay was better designed.  I would have liked this game, if the gameplay was better designed. 
1370	Viewpoint and Controls: Two basics that Zombie Driver screws-up. Each on their own would be bearable, but not being able to see where you're going and not being able to respond appropriately when you get there is a killer blow. The campaign is alright but you'll have more fun playing one of the normal Zombie/Alien Shooter games that doesn't hinder you with an unresponsive/over-responsive vehicle.  
1371	the video shows it to be great, but the reality is that you can never really drive fast and ram zombies. the controls are so clunky, the game is too easy, and the cars drive way faster than you can possibly comprehend the map that is loaded with obstacles. if you play this game your time will mostly be spent bumping itnto walls and trying to turn around or changing from drive to reverse. its such a shame that a game can fall so ahrd on the basics like controls. maybe its because i played on keyboard, maybe not. also you cant change any graphics settings.
1372	I thought this would be a great game, going around using your vehicle as a weapon and killing all the zombies. However, everything in the game is against you. When driving, you have to collect fuel, health and ammo, but you don't know where to find these meaning you run out of fuel or ammo, or your health does down and you die. You can either try and rescue the survivors but with not enough fuel, or you can try and find fuel but then there is not enough time remaining to rescue the survivors. Some of the zombie groups must have hundreds of zombies in, and even with a tough car, you car easily gets damaged. Then there are super zombies who will damage your car even further, and even throw objects at your car! At least make the zombies realistic, not super thinking toughened zombies who will seek out objects to throw at your car! The graphics are awesome as very detailed, and in theory this is a good game, but in practice it is awful. You end up keep being killed which puts you off playing the game any more.
1373	A lot of fun for a few missions, then the problems quickly add up. I've never seen a game like this with such a large amount of small annoying problems that all add up to one big disappointment. I was constantly shaking my head and squinting my eyes in disbelief at the stupid little ways in which they did most things that they could have done differently/better. It's too bad, because in the hands of a real game company that knows how to make a real game, this could have been great. Or actually probably not since it's vehicle combat meaning you only fire in one direction: forward. Then you back up, reposition, line up, hit the brakes, turn around, speed up, reposition more and â¥â¥â¥â¥-all else to get more shots off in a straight line before quickly having to do all that again. lol.  There are a ton of other problems with the game but it really isn't worth my time talking about it in detail. The bottom line is that this is just not fun for long because of poor design concepts and new flaws popping up constantly as the game progresses.  5/10
1374	Visually cluttered to the extent that I couldn't see the track clearly enough to drive round it competitively, so either the game is too fast paced, or the track needs to be more clearly defined.  Gave up before realising that I'd driven the same race several times and that I was supposed to select the next one. It's not the worst game on Steam, but it didn't draw me in as an intuitive and fun experience. It's rough around the edges, but atleast it's cheap and works.
1375	The controls for driving in this game are terrible with keyboard. I will most likely change this review as soon as I get a controller if it turns out to be good. 
1376	ZOMBIES ARE NOT THE ENEMY. THE CONTROLS ARE.
1377	i have had the worst experience with this game when i run it it has an unknown error ive spent hours trying to figure it out and nothing  
1378	Vehicle and camera movement are awful, otherwise this would be a fun game.
1379	Fun while it lasts, but alas hit 'n' run is about all you get.
1380	Great looking game, great idea, but the steering is horrible, and it ruins the game.
1381	Thanks to the awful camera system I only lasted five vomit-inducing minutes. I've no idea how people completed this game. They can't be human.
1382	The game was interesting and certainly a unique concept but unfortunately I found the game unplayable. The car acted clunky and unreallistic. The voice acting and sound effects were less than great. Of course this game is in early release so I am sure they are dealling with this.
1383	What a terrible game.  Firstly, the map has too many things I collide into. In a game like this, you'd expect to be driving around at high speeds, mowing down hordes and hordes. But no, instead when you navigate around you must take your time and try not to ram into every little thing! It slowed down the game so badly, and this has got to be one of the worst parts, since the 1 hour I spent was carefully driving slowly, so I don't bump into something.  What about the other 30 dreadful minutes I spent? Well, let's say it was just killing a few zombies here and there, but it wasn't exciting in any way. Just shooting them, drive away, shoot, probably run over them a bit, it wasn't too satisfying really. The bosses were also ridiculously hard for some reason, I just stopped though by the time I killed the 1st one, it was so boring.  Oh yeah, I completely forgot there was a story that was just shoved in, trying to interest you, but it didn't. At least they tried to make one though, but I would've prefered nothing.  I hate this game. I spent a dollar on it and I still regret my decision.
1384	This game is more of an arcade type of game with not very many upgrades. Also the gameplay wasnt even that great. Honestly the only slightly cool thing in my opinion is the zombie bosses. This is more of a game for people who like a challenging driving game and pick up upgrades on the side of the rode. Personally I dislike it and I didnt know what I was expecting when I bought thankfully I got it when it was on sale for a cheap price but I still wouldnt suggest it to anyone of my friends though.
1385	this game got my confused i always wanted to PLAY a zombie theni bought this and i get just automobile, you never get to see driver is he realy zombie or not?? so huge let-down for me..
1386	Driving is stupid as ape. You should only use WASD for driving...
1387	Graphics are HORRIBLE.  DO NOT BUY  3/10
1388	2016 and still there are games where you can't bind keys. WTF dude.  Basically, if you don't have qwerty keyvboard, can't play.
1389	you crash in every wall..useless speed..
1390	ä¹°äºç©ä¸äºï¼ï¼ï¼ä¸ç´æ¥éï¼ï¼ï¼ Some ERROR has occured and it can't be played.
1391	the game is ok, can be boring, can also be fun. if you like cars and killing zombies can get some power up - But very repetive, you have to do some quests or side quests to move on.  If u are into cars and into racing things, this might be for you, you will also kill some zombies in the progress but don't really expect too much fun from the game though.  i give this 6/10
1392	Gave it a shot- it was $2.49... its ok. cars handle differently, and hitting zombies with them has impact. Racing mode was fun (single player only). i didnt try the arena mode. Story mode has zero variety, but thats forgivable i guess, you drive around killing zombies and pick up powerups and upgrade your car. the thing that makes me NOT recommend - is that i break out into cold sweats from getting dizzy while driving. i think this may be due to the camera... if i played this for an hour i think i would throw up and need to lie down. i dont know - that may be just me... but other top down games like Nation Red or Gatling Gears, did not make me feel this way. too bad. it had some things going for it. maybe playing a mission once in a while or playing a race when waiting for a download or something would be cool. i also liked that it had full controller support, thats always nice to have in a game. But overall - if you are sensitive to cameras spinning without your input- i would avoid.   EDIT: OK i went back and tried 1 more mission - with the 3rd and last camera option.... Free Camera mode is a little better. And the game threw a Defend this Area type mission... but its still made me dizzy a bit. I think the camera is too close and has to adjust itself too often since you can be driving quite fast. so yea.... i still would not really recommend.
1393	So I picked this up in the weeklong sale for $3.  The gameplay seems fun. I like the upgrade system and the car handles generally well.  I asked for a refund because the camera movement is crazy and makde me feel ill. I haven't ever gotten that feeling from a game before but Zombie Driver HD got me feeling sick. So buyer beware!
1394	Sweet Jesus.  from the wiki: 'Motion sickness or kinetosis, also known as travel sickness, is a condition in which a disagreement exists between visually perceived movement and the vestibular system's sense of movement. Depending on the cause, it can also be referred to as seasickness, car sickness, simulation sickness or airsickness.[1]  Dizziness, fatigue, and nausea are the most common symptoms of motion sickness.[2] Sopite syndrome in which a person feels fatigue or tiredness is also associated with motion sickness. Nausea in Greek means seasickness (naus means ship).[3][4] If the motion causing nausea is not resolved, the sufferer will usually vomit. Vomiting won't relieve the feeling of weakness and nausea, which means the person could vomit until the cause of nausea is found.'  Well, 'the cause of the nausea' has been found and its name is 'Zombie Driver HD'. Seriously, if you were to design a game to cause 'a condition in which a disagreement exists between visually perceived movement and the vestibular system's sense of movement', this would be it. Zombie Driver HD, is basically a vomit simulator . . . in HD (or should that be 'stimulator'? I dont know. I've just been playing it, so im fairly disorientated).  I would highly recommend trying the demo before you buy, as watching the trailer does not do justice to the epic degree of nausea felt while actualy playing.  Then again, you might, (like I did), think 'â¥â¥â¥â¥ it. It looks cool. Im getting it.' More power to you. You too can be the ower of the most powerful 'multicolour yawn' inducing set of camera options in gaming. 
1395	4/10
1396	hated everything
1397	its not leting me play
1398	I take back what I said, this 'HD' upgrade isn't so great, a lot of the new content is just filler and the voice acting is so bad that it's awful, good thing it was cheap.
1399	It looks cool, it seems cool but i dont like controls, feels akward, ammo ends too fast
1400	Stopped playing due to the awful camera-movement. 3/10
1401	Fun but very,very,very buggy and glitchy.  Fps drops to 0 in cutscenes and at random during gameplay. The map doesn't load in the story mode. And more that I probably forgot to list.  If the devs fix these problems and I have this brought to my attention, I will change my review because the actual game is pretty fun but again, the bugs just ruin it.
1402	I had really high expectations for this game because of its awesome ideas and sweet trailer. I was sadly disappointed.  The game seems to be a cheap port of a mobile game, with car handling very suited for tilt controls, or at least a gamepad, but certainly not a keyboard. The gameplay is dull, and early on too difficult. The voice acted cutscenes seem too long and there is no way to skip them, forcing you to endure their pain.  Overall, do not buy this game on Steam. Even at 50% or 75% off, it is a rip off. It's probably on some sort of app store somewhere, go buy it there.
1403	This game does have some decent aspects to it but nothing exceptional and the ending was....less then complimentary. If you can get it on sale for $2 or less its worth it because there is some fun aspects to it but overall the game is in my opinion not worth more then that.
1404	This games was great on my other laptop. However my new laptop has a Nvidia Optimus chipset (Intel + Nvidia). If i launch the game with the integrated Intel HD4600 it start and runs, but cannot keep up. If i launch with the Nvidia card I get the configuration utility which only shows the Intel HD4600, if i try to launch I get a Microsoft Visual C++ error.   There have been multiple threads about the issue, i have tried all possible solutions but no luck. This has to do with the video card (and the fact the configuration utility cannot even choose my Nvidia card). My setup works on all 40 of my other steam games without a problem (even tried the Nvidia on Monkey Island, a little overkill but it still works).  The game itself is fun an brillant, however due to the fact no one with the Nvidia Optimus can get any support from the game developers i would not purchase this game (there was just an update in August so the game is far from abandoned). If they fix the game i will change my recommendation. However seeing as though i cannot play it i would not recommend to anyone else to purchase.
1405	I recieved a coupon through crafting a badge that showed me this game. It actually allowed me to get this game for a dollar. I was pleased - an inexpensive game with an interesting and fun sounding idea and an equally interesting and fun looking trailer? Sign me up.  No no no, wait, take my name back off of that. Now. I changed my mind. First impressions told me that this game was goign to be fun, to be interesting, and be overall very enjoyable. It isn't. The controlls make the car hard to manuver, amn near impossible to kill anything with, and overall, it simply feels broken. I figured, then, with the story mode being lackluster, I could probably get some enjoyment out of the Arena mode. Locked in an arena with a near endless supply of zombies. Just you can your car to fight them all off... Sounds good, right? Just as boring. Jombies drop like rocks at the touch of your car, and do almost nothing to it. I started the first arena in hard mode - ten minutes later I got the gold medal by doing nothinbg but holding the fire button and driving in circles.  Terrible game.
1406	Pretty basic and boring.
1407	Runover a zombie. Get yelled at by your boss. Runover some more zombies.... Thats the whole game... â¥â¥â¥â¥in... 9 euros
1408	Don't buy this game. It has its fun moments, but there are way too few of them and most of the time you're bored while playing it. The levels have no gimmicks, no variety, nothing. Just skip it.
1409	Worst game i've played in a while. Bad controls, boring, not fun at all. My belief is this game started as a joke.
1410	It was on offer and cheap
1411	This game is so bad. Luckily I only spent 70p on it. First person mode or bust.
1412	WARNING ! This game give nausea !!!  Even if you never get nausea by playing, buy this game only if you want to vomit.  Read the forums, there are discussions about that.   The game is cool, but it's actually unplayable.
1413	Vrrrrrm vrrrummmmmm.... okay, why? You run over zombie stuff and shoot big creatures...  It's pretty boring. I guess I get bored too easy, I don't see it as a racing game, I mean, you can try to beat it within a certain time limit, but games that have time limits, you don't tag it as a racing game.  So what you do is run â¥â¥â¥â¥ over and then pick â¥â¥â¥â¥ up and then drop â¥â¥â¥â¥ off.  THis game is not worth it.
1414	Repetative gameplay, annoying controls. Don't like.
1415	Top down driving game/zombie killer. Recalls classics like the first GTA's and Death Rally. 2/5
1416	
1417	This should of been a free flash game.
1418	Another garbage game full of cheater's ! ( is not right to play from TOP 10 )   TOP 10 in this game are cheater's with Cheat Engine !  Steam id :  http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198011536129  - TOP10 ( is already V.A.C. banned )  Steam id :  http://steamcommunity.com/id/RADO787/  - TOP 10 ( is already V.A.C banned )   This 2 kids are in TOP 10 clasament from Zombie Drivers ... !  Why i need to pay money from this game ??? For what ???  To see TOP 10 CHEATERS ???  WHEN DEV. remove all cheaters from TOP 10 LIST ... i change my review in pozitive review !
1419	Game doesn't work with my keyboard or PS4 wireless controller. Could only play a little bit going back and forward and using the emergency break a little bit.
1420	Not really my cup of brains...
1421	It's a mobile game, and personally I don't want to play them on a expensive computer.
1422	Controls are crap. Not sure at which disount I got it, but I think it was a waste.
1423	even Mobile Phone Grapics are way better
1424	the ground is always blue and glitchy  i would not play this for 50 cents p.s its also really buggy
1425	Don't spent your money for sh*(ts
1426	not really that great of a games. So many better options out there. Design is really lacking. Doesnt create a desire to keep playing.
1427	This game gets boring really fast and reminds me of free games you play on a phone! I got it for 99 cents and would have to say I wouldnt play it if it were free! Not worth downloading onto a gaming rig at all and I laugh at reviews that say it is great.
1428	To be honest, I wanted a Netrual button over here, its unffair to say that this game is crap, but there are some points that avoid me to enjoy this 100% Tobe honest I have played only the single-player campaign. need to say that for cons this game is well balanced, has a fair challenge, great graphics and has a nice twist on the over-used zombie formula. But the game has some very annoying issues, first of all the campaign drags itself far too long. 30 levels with many many missions types repetead over and over again,how many scientis do I need to rescue ?  And : Stop at the marker  Zombies left in the area : 2 Stop at the marker Zombies left in te area : 3 Stop at the marker Zombies left in the area : 1 
1429	It's okay to play for a few minutes at a time but it gets very repetitive. Bought the game on sale so it's worth the $2.50 but I wouldn't pay full price for it.
1430	Wou;ld've liked this game more if it had more mission variety since 70% of the missions is mostly rescuing survivors.
1431	Don't bother buying, did not start properly. Despite trying ways suggested in the support forum I could not get this game running. Emailed my problems to the support team but no answers from them.
1432	ZDHD didn't agree with me. The gameplay is too shallow to be entertaining, environments to crowded to enjoy the top-down driving aspects. Controls didn't work too well for me, either.  All in all: Stay away.
1433	The HD version officially makes the game not fun anymore. It ruins it. Sure the graphics and atmosphere are much better, but it's now escort missions and uneeded boss fights. Not to mention it likes to grab the camera away from you to see the objective like you are some dummy. Oh and you can't pause to look at the map anymore, which is by far the most annoying thing.
1434	As I write this review I'm on the verge of vomiting. Not because I'm being over dramatic, but because I'm literally nauseous from playing this game. I thought it was just me until a read another reviewer suffering the same symptoms. The graphics, theme, and content of the game are fine. But it's the gameplay that made me sick which consists of you driving endlessly round, and round, and round... Oh gosh I'm making myself sicker just thinking about it.  Perhaps if the maps were bigger and had a better layout, I would have no complaints. But because of my negative experience I say stay away from this game if you get car sick easily. It's too bad because I was looking forward to this game. At least I only paid something like $2.  By the way I just took a pill for motion sickness and I hope it kicks in real soon.
1435	Ignore all the positive reviews, this game sucks. I only played it because the steam trading cards this thing gives , have a pretty nice value regular cards about 20 cents and the foils over 2 bucks. if you want some steam money , then buy this â¥â¥â¥â¥ while its on sale, grab all the cards , and never talk about this game ever again
1436	The looks nice and is quite interesting. Although I have DLCs with additional missions and so on, I didn't used them. The game bored me after about 15-20 missions. It's all about killing zombies. Without co-op it's not worth playing longer than just to relax few times for about 20 minutes. Also the ingame font is really small on big screens and resolutions. And since you can play with controller it should have better fit for big screens.
1437	The game is kinda fun but the biggest weakness is the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing driving, which makes up about... all of the game. The only reason this game is so bad for me is that every 10~ seconds of holding down the button to turn left or right the car will randomly say 'hey i see you wanna turn in that direction, welp â¥â¥â¥â¥ you.'  Seriously in what world does a driving game not listen to the directions you give it. I mean the shooting is ok and so is the whole gun and repair mechanic but the fact you cant drive three feet without your car suddenly not listening to you is impossible.
1438	I had a coupon for this game and I think I paid $2.50, I'm kind of regretting spending that much money on this. I mean it was an entertaining game, the problem is its not worth the money you pay, not even $2.50 like in my situation. A few days before I got this game, I had 2 coupon codes for 2 other games. One game was in the $10 price range and the other game was in a $5 price range. In total, the price was $1.75 (these coupons were bigger). One of the 2 games (the $10 one) I would've gladly paid $7 or even $10 at max for, while the other one (the $5 one) I would've paid $3.75 at max for; this game I would've paid at max $0.50. So I guess its a good game, just not worth the money you pay.
1439	Every generation has their own 'Citizen Kane', mine was 'Citizen Kane' and actually, so was every other generation's when you think about it.  Zombie Driver HD (ZDHD) is very honest in its marketing, I appreciate that. Let's all golf clap for ZDHD. Now, on to gameplay:  If you enjoy driving, with Zombies around - this game is for you. If perhaps you prefer a more cerebral experience - why on earth are you reading reviews for a game called 'Zombie Driver HD'?  If you're into a tablet port where things go splat - great, here's your game. Enjoy, splat some zombies and have fun. I don't doubt that you'll have fun as this is a fun game - just not for me.
1440	It honestly just feels like a mobile game. The game is so bland and uninteresting and it's so fast paced you don't even know (or care) about what you're doing, whether its finding a survivor or just running over zombies (basically the only two things you can do in the game). That being said, all you really do is    run over zombies and    try to steer a car with a wonky turning system. This is literally a game about driving, they could have at least gotten that right. The game looks good and all, and the achievements seem like they would keep the repetitive game alive, but all and all, it just isn't fun after 10 minutes. It tries to tell a story but 20 minutes in you'll be scratching your head at the pathetic dialogue and nonexistent 'plot'. You just drive over zombies. It's not god-awful, but even on sale for $3 I want my money back.
1441	Game is broken as â¥â¥â¥â¥ and devs refuse to help or tell you if theyre working on an update or a fix.  I couldnt not be more dissapointed..hope this game gets pulled off steam.
1442	My Playstation 2 called from the garage and wants it's â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game back.
1443	Game is great. But wont work on my win 7 64bits and nvidia cart. Game goes crazy avery time after few min.
1444	You will never find a game like this where the designers had to cheat to make it work. No matter how shallow an angle you will stick to the object you hit. You take seconds to get moving from a stop where the other cars go right to full speed. Any oversteer puts you right into the opposite wall. There are times you are looking at the screen wondering how the hell you ended up the way you did. No matter what you buy you will never have an advantage. Save the money and save the stress.
1445	Fails every time to start. Steam integrity check finds 1 corrupted file every time and re-downloads it. Fails to start again. Everything else on my PC works fine, no viruses to make the files corrupt and such.  -/10  Once it starts and is running I'll evaluate it.
1446	-2/10- Nowhere near the Open World games that are out already, its way too linear and story is kinda dull The idea behind the game is great and very innovative, but poorly executed twice now In the open world game genre this game fails to deliver mainly because it lacks any RPG elements and sandbox, basically its a linear shooter with nice areas to explore. Fails to deliver even in the shooter (FPS) category, I only kept playing it because I like the map detail and the idea, exploring is actually the most fun this game has to offer as it is a very nicely crafted postwar map. I tried, but somehow I just can't force myself anymore to finish this game  Pros: -Good graphics, but could be better -beautifully crafted, detailed and dense world -Weapon customization on the go -Most of gameplay reminds me on Far Cry, but its good if you are a fan of it -Cry Engine was a great engine choice for this game, but read bellow, it needs fixing  Cons: -BUGFEST, lost count how many times I fell though the ground into the big empty and how many times it failed to load environment and how many times I had to restart the game because couldn't complete mission due to a bug. -In many places game feels incomplete, like content has been cut out to be sold later as DLC -Optimization needs working on, stuttering in some places and other glitches -Dull, predictable AI, poor AI variation, AI bullet sponges -Poor voice acting -Poor writing, story is just not engaging and not detailed enough -Very tiny weapon choice, why the hell can't I pick up and use enemy weaponry??? -Cannot shoot while riding a bike -No supressor for rifles -Stealth system is a total lackluster, a disaster in a game that requires it to a large part, cannot even hide bodies -No voice acting or dialogue options for main character -Characters are boring, mostly feel irrelevant, couldn't care less about them -Activities and missions get repetitive very fast, some even to an annoying level -No co-op for story mode and co-op resistance mode has only a few missions -No other multiplayer besides co-operative mode -Map is separated into sectors which can only to be unlocked one by one in doing story missions, so where is the open world? -Liberating outposts and other side activities don't feel rewarding, but rather a chore after a while  In summary I couldn't care less about liberating a bunch of boring, dull, lazy, same repeating face over and over characters and AI, it rather seems that the KPA is the best thing that could happen to the people in the game. its a rushed out game, its substandard, with a pseudo open world, where your movement is so limited, that it feels just like a linear shooter. A lot work is needed here to make it worth to be a AAA title, many updates on gameplay and mechanics including stealth are needed. Can't even recommend it on sale, not worth its full price, no way. I guess this is it for Homefront franchise
1447	Listen, I love the whole homefront theme. Well I loved it until this garbage came out. I know you guys worked hard on it but still. Glitches up the wazoo, horrible storyline, and no real feel of change as you take back all the tiny outposts along your way to the main missions. I wish I had listened to the reviews and not given you guys the benefit of the doubt. I hate to say it but damn guys....
1448	For the first ten or so hours, I was ready to defend Homefront: The Revolution. The setting and atmosphere was, for a while at least, enough to make me overlook some small bugs here and there.   But then the cracks really started showing, specifically in regards to artificial difficulty brought about by endlessly spawning enemies. As the game continued, it seemed that engaging even one enemy out in the open summoned a horde of his buddies, all of whom know exactly where you are as soon as they show up. They will continue spawning until you eventually become overwhelmed and die.   This becomes increasingly annoying when you're merely trying to make your way to the next main objective and each time you turn a corner there's a patrol that wasn't there 2 minutes ago. Yes, they just popped into existence once you looked away and back again. And now they're like some sort of reverse necromancers, endlessly summoning every living thing within a 10 mile radius to zero in on you for the rest of time.   I was willing to overlook the iffy blandness of the rest of the game and just kick back for a low budget urban Far Cry. But this is supremely unfun. Do not buy or play this game ever.
1449	The hype was real for this game, at least for me that is. Love it or hate it, but I was a huge fan of the first Homefront. Even though the gameplay was a bit generic, I did enjoy the setting and world it brought you into. So naturally when watching trailers for the next installment, Homefront: The Revolution, I was pretty hyped. I preordered it and was happy to finally get my hands on it. Then I played it.   I first noticed small changes in the story and the opening 'cinematic' seemed kind of cheesy at times with its obvious people standing in front of a green screen but it was fine. Opening scenes were pretty cool, I was starting to get into it, then I got to control the character. The first little city area was really nice and detailed, but I noticed some issues with animations on NPC characters and my character. For example, when I was using a tool to cut some chain on a fence, the animation was totally out of sync. Minor things, nothing to get upset about but it was noticable. So I finish this kind of tutorial mission and was on my way to the more open world section of the game. Then I notice a lot of other... Things.  First thing I noticed was this NPC character I was talking to, the most interesting thing about him is he had a twin brother who sounded exactly the same. But what do you mean? Well I guess they decided that two of the same NPCs were going to stand right next to eachother all the time. Now I understand that character models will be reused, that's normal, but when two of the same model NPC are next to eachother all the time and in a VERY small area it's just really noticable. This actually happened multiple times too, if it happened a few times sure I get it, it happens, but this was constant and just really off putting.   Now when I started entering this 'open world' area, I noticed immediate frame drops. Now my PC is pretty decent, i7 4690k, GTX 970, 16GB memory, ect., and even when turning the settings on low it was still really choppy. On top of that the game just felt clunky, moving around and shooting just didn't feel fluid. I had just got done playing the new DOOM, which is a wonderful game that is just a very smooth experience, and I did feel that Homefront felt more clunky just from comparison. I know they are two different games with different play styles, but they are both FPS games and it really gives a comparison from a smooth FPS, to a clunky FPS.   Something to mention is the graphics. I'm not too picky about the way a game looks, but really this game did not look very good for something coming out in 2016 on CryEngine, even on the highest settings. They are not bad, the graphics just seemed a bit outdated. Now some areas of the game look really nice, for example the city areas. They can be very detailed, and look especially good durning night time with some weather effects like rain. However there are lots of areas that just look bland and have very poor textures.  One thing I thought was pretty innovative was the weapon system. You can unlock different customizations to turn one basic weapon into a completely different weapon, or just swapping out parts for that weapon on the spot. Like turning a crossbow into a shotgun, that's awesome. You can go in all sneaky beaky like (except sneaking is almost non-existant) and then blast someone in close quarters. Only problem is navigating the menu for swapping out weapon parts can be really clunky, and has often gotten me killed when I was trying to swap things out on the fly.  After plays a few missions the game felt kind of repeatitive, which is fine if you like games like that, I personally don't mind it. It kind of reminds me of Farcry, specifically Farcry 3. The side missions in Farcry 3 could get repeatitive, but the main story missions were actually unique and were overall fun. Homefronts side missions could get repeatitive, but the main story missions were only kind of fun... Sometimes. The biggest problem I had was when you entered a new city area and you had to 'raise morale' by doing stuff that the KPA (Bad guys) didn't like. The game just slowed to a crawl. I was SO BORED at this part and it took what seemed like forever to even finish the mission.   At this point the game was running terribly with choppy frames and clunky gameplay, I was bored out of my mind, the teammates I recruited were all the same NPC model, and the game looked very subpar. I'm pretty disappointed, and this is where I stopped playing. Now I know this game went through development hell and that heavy affected the way this project turned out, but these things still cannot be overlooked. I wish I had played a bit more before writing this review, especially since this is only touching on the single player experience and not the co-op, but only after a few hours in I think I've had quite a bit to talk about.   Of course this is all just my experience and opinion on things, which I know everyone cares about and values on the internet, but I hope my insight has given you some useful information about Homefront: The Revolution. I strongly recommend watching some gameplay video of both the story and coop mode and reading more before you decide to purchase to see if this game is reight for you.    -Hunnytoes    
1450	If you were waiting for the 2.0 patch then I'm happy to say you made the right decision. The patch released today makes the game run like a whole new game. They did a fantastic job with this patch. My SLI flicker woes are now gone and the game is running like a well oiled machine at 3440x1440 with everything maxed, minus the TAA blur. Prior to this patch the game was a flickering, juddery mess with huge fps drops randomly. Good job Dambuster on this patch. Had only the game released like this, you would have had a 'mostly positive' game I'm sure.
1451	Short Review:  Pros -Decent Graphics -Okay gun customization and combat  Cons -Poorly Optimized -Short Story -Terrible Animation -Bad Voice Acting -Lack of uniqueness in content -Very small for being advertised as 'Open World'   Long Review:  Intro: Homefront at first seemed like a promising game, but red lights began flashing when the original studio closed down and had to switch hands to Dambuster. Deepsilver ended up publishing the game and they have published decent titles in the past including the newest Saints Row and both games in the Metro series. Following this obvious poor pattern of development, it should already be a clear sign that the title probably won't be that good.   Pros: That being said the game itself is pretty bad. To start with the pros, I tried my best to understand what good came out of this game, but its really tough considering theres such a very very small amount of unique polish that no other game has. The idea of liberating apartments just reminds me of Far Cry 4, and the 'Hearts and Minds' or morale meter of increasing the civillian morale is already stolen from other games, first that comes to mind is InFamous: Second Son. The gunplay is that of every other game except it does sort've have an interesting customization concept of swapping gun's slide and replacing it with totally different body. As mentioned in the short review, the graphics are decent, but they're really nothing to go home about, moderate as of 2016 although in a year's time they definitely will fall very short.   Cons: Now after slaying the pros I want to present the cons. For one thing, I am running a Nvidia GeForce GtX 980 FTW Edition, and I still found a lot of very poor optimization areas throughout my playthrough. Many stuttering issues that brought my FPS just because a cutscene began or a few enemies loaded on my screen. Next I want to touch on the story. In my opinion the concept seemed kind've cool and sort've unique. The execution of that said concept is very poor, the story is very cliche and predictable, Its also incredibly short, I managed to beat it in 3 sit downs of about 3 hours. The gameplay in it is so repetitive and you just do the exact same things which include capturing small bases, finding an object and fighting KPA. After you end up beating this short but not very sweet game, you can't even return to it to complete extra side content or upgrade your weapons all the way, which punishes any player who decides to dedicate extra time towards doing the repetitive tasks. The overall production value in this game falls short of many games I've ever played. The animation is absolutely terrible. when jumping in real life I typically don't see my legs spaghetti everywhere even if I am quite thin. Also in cutscenes the major characters seem to just sink into the ground as if the KPA replaced all of America's ground with quicksand. The voice acting falls very short in the impressions that some VA's try to do. And it almost seems as if the highest produced portion of this game is the song that plays in the 35 minute long credits.  Overall: The only time I'd recommend you to buy this game is to MAYBE play resistance mode with your friends, but under no circumstances should you spend $60 on it, I'd wait until a sale marks this price down to $10-$20, because thats the absolute MOST value you can get out of this title.
1452	 Update 5/20 - They released a patch today that is supposed to change how the game saves graphical settings, but other than that I did notice that the game does not stutter when the framerate drops below 60, and the devs have repeatedly acknowledged that many are having performance issues. It's a great sign for the future that the game will improve.   Graphics
1453	7.5 out of 10 Until some patches are released then it will certainly be an 8.  Let me give and quick review and then a rant about the crap I have seen around this game. First you as a consumer must know what you are buying. You are not buying a game that puts you in the position of being able to run through waves of enemies with a minigun. The game is trying to make you feel like you can't do that. So for all of you who are not very good at shooters and just like casually running through waves of enemies. Buy something else.   If you are a HUGE story buff and need plot twists, grand complexity, and touching moments mixed of course with the tad of romance. This is not your game.   This game is about the end of America and the resistance fighters who are trying to get it back. It is about being out numbered and knowing when to run. It is about exploring a beautiful world and doing some pretty awesome stuff along the way. Its not that innovative, but it still has its innovations and, for my computer, it works.  Pros - Excellent world - Graphics are beautiful - Solid game play and game mechanics (melee kills are great too) - Very cool attachment system - It is challenging - Story is not too bad - You do feel like a guerilla - Sometimes the AI actually is pretty decent (see below though) - There actually does seem to be quite a bit of attention to detail in the world - Coop is very fun, especially with the right people who want to do more than just rush to the objective - The coop maps are pretty cool - The customization in the coop definitely adds some replay ability - Though we will have to see how long it takes, they have promised 18 more free coop maps to be released over this year.  Cons - There are some occasional frame drops (but there are basically no loading screens, what do you expect?) - There are some glitches - The game does feel like it is lacking some polish that hopefully will come out in updates and patches very soon. - As with any open world game, there can be some repetition in side missions, but there is still diversity - The AI can be stupid at times. - The coop is short  Let me say that I have officailly disowned IGN as a credible game review company. It certainly seems like the higher they are paid, the better the score and this game did not have the money to spare I guess. However, the real issues I have are with the people who have reviewed it and are not pro reviewers.   I saw multiple 0 out of 10 reviews within the first 3 hours of the game being released and these were not people who had it before and they did not indicate such. They also did not complain about not being able to run it, but just talked about how much of a flop it was. GARBAGE. I highly doubt they even played the game at all.  I am honestly amazed at the gaming community. It is like the vast majority are a bunch of bummed out, depressed athiests, who hate everything. There isn't a single game they call good except stupid indie games. Have you become so jaded that you can't enjoy games anymore? It appears so.   So shame on you gaming community. You have become a bunch of ungrateful whiners.  I will update this review the more I play it.   UPDATE: I have now completed the game and would like to say that I will give this game a 7.5 of 10. It simply was not polished enough to get an 8. Had the polishing work been done, then it would have been a solid 8. There are definitely some bugs, frame drops, second or two freezes all which do hamper the experience at times. Thankfully with my system, I have not had them too often. The storyline was so close to being solid, but again polish with a few more cinematic pauses in some of the cut scenes to take things in would have made it very sweet.   Again, polish is all this game is lacking. Aside from that I have had a blast with it. I have really enjoyed the coop and I am looking forward to more levels. I will definitely replay the single player game once the devs get it more stable. They have been working on it and seem to be very concerned about making this game work well. I would say, pick this game up on a sale and it will be totally worth it.
1454	This game is like a very very broken far cry. You can't play it rambo style because of endless respawning enemies and you cant play it stealth because every enemy in the whole â¥â¥â¥â¥ing world is alerted when you only shoot once. You cant even buy silencers. Furthermore the A.I. is completly broken: On one hand its ridiculously underpowerd... enemies keep walking in the same doorframe so you can stack 100000 corpses there. On the other hand is overpowered because it makes stealth literally impossible. The A.I basicly detects you instantly and you could run through the sewer for hours without anyone seeing you but when you are back in the open the enemy still knows exactly where you are. EXTREMLY unsatisfying gameplay. I cant force myself to play any more of this crap.
1455	Things I can say for Homefront: The Revolution:  Please note this is from  Single Player experience   - Poor Graphics Optimization - Poor Lip Sync - POOR Storyline - Limited Weapon Attachemnts (I'm talking to you rifle silencers...) (even though cool Weapon Customization) - Side Missions are bad - Finished main story, unable to finish the remaining side missions - Poor Waypoint Optimization! *rage flips table* - KPAs not searching hiding spots (Year 1990-1995 game?) - Arcade game,   Time Splitters 2, found in restricted area (Prisoner Zone)   has better gameplay - Sudden freeze in between cutscenes and ammo refilling - Bad RC consumable movement &amp; collision - Cannot use bikes to shoot  Is this worth $50 or $70 (with expansion)?  North Koreans may even think this game's a joke...
1456	Just completed the campaign and it was 19 hours for me, doing just about everything. haven't done the co-op but from what I can see it's not worth writing home about. Gameplay is ok, not great, story is good, not great. All and all it's probably a item that should wait until it's on sale. It's a decent game just not worth the money it's listed as right now.  I had no problems with crashing, fps was consistent 54 on high with shadows turned down (they seemed buggy fps wise) with I7-3770k Gtx 960 with 16 gb of ram.. I didn't have any issues with fps drops or hitching of any kind ran good. Also there are reports of adding this  -USEALLAVAILABLECORE to launch options helps.
1457	Played the game for a couple of hours, the story is nothing to write home about but after the september 1 patch it seems all the slowdown and graphical glitches are gone. I havent experienced any stuttering either. And game runs 30-40 fps on my rather old GTX 870M powered laptop with medium to high setting at 1080p. The game feels a lot like a post war far cry  Pros: 1. You can shoot a lot of people 2. The game runs smooth now 3. Bad guys are called Norks (Norks=Boobs in England) LOL! 4. Weapon customization can be fun. 5. Its really cheap now so worth a try  Cons: 1. Story is silly and requires an extreme suspension of disbelief 2. THe bad guys are fairly generic 3. Feels a lot like Far Cry but not quite as good 4. Mouse is terrible smoothed but it can be fixed (See below) 5. Not worth more than a single playthrough  Summary : Worth playing once now that the glitches, graphical issues and bugs have been fixed  6.5/10  CORRECT MOUSE SMOOTHENING BY DOING THIS :  Go to your system.cfg file and add these line   CVar: i_mouse_smooth=0.0 CVar: i_mouse_accel=0.0  'found this info on steam forums'
1458	 Terminator: The Game or How I stopped worrying about the hate and love the game
1459	I am with a lot of the people out there who have encountered a glitch in this game. Regrettably mine was a game killing one. Everything I have seen online suggests that the only way to fix this glitch is to uninstall then reinstall and start all over again. When in Lombard and doing the find the goliath schematics mission be wary to only shoot the tiles in the designated building don't stab them.  This game had great potential and I wanted to believe that it wouldn't be as bad as a lot of people were making it out to be. However, this glitch along with a few other annoyances that made the game seem excessively rushed and incomplete.  Parts of this game were amazing but then the others were just terrible. I can't in good conscience recommend a game that will be as potentially faulty as mine. Dambuster... Please try again, don't give up on it.
1460	I am a man of positive thinking. I don't like exposing hatred towards everything. Well, let me start writing something about this game. This game, if i say overall, is an average. Its neither so good nor so bad. I wont talk about the mainstream topic about this game which is bug.    Pros
1461	I read the reviews before I began to play and thought to myself (oh crap, another assassins creed unity fiasco) I mean every game has bad reviews the first couple days or even weeks because of reasons that many new releases suffer for that usually get patched within a couple weeks, but people were seriously hammering down on this game like it had reset the cure for cancer back to 0. I reluctantly started playing it after a long days work expecting to be disappointed by another crappy AAA title, and then you know what happened next? I sat in disbelief and confusion in what in the actual hell everyone was complaining about! I have an amd 8350 cpu and a GTX 760 (not massively high end) and I play this game on all high settings with NO PERFORMANCE ISSUES AT ALL like seriously, I can't say I understand how people with I7's and 980s are having performance problems when I can run at high with a steady 60fps no problem.  I havent encountered a single bug and the game plays exactly as I wished it would, open world style fps with a challenge, I would say this game is almost like a combination between farcry &amp; Mercinaries 2, it has the rpg aspects that everyone expected with the epic gun customization and crafting, and keeps to the promise of guerilla warfare over run and gun tactics.  I find it ironic that I followed the division for 3 years only to play it for less hours than I've already put into this game which I only knew about a few weeks before launch. The story so far is amazing, some parts funny some parts really dark (pretty much exactly what I expected from a sequel to the original storyline) but in all seriousness I can't put my finger on why people hate this game so much, its like people are just aching for the next game to blame and follow the band wagon.  Hopefully the reviews dont stay the way that they are because if so then I know a lot of people are going to be holding back on this purchase which is a real shame since it's actually quite solid of a title.  All things considered I could give this game a solid 7.5 personally, mainly because the voice acting is pretty poor, but the gameplay and story more than make up for some interlapping lines and such.  EDIT: So I havent beaten the story yet, but I have dabbled in the multiplayer to see what they have going on there since it was a pretty big part of the game. Firstly to anybody whos wondering, there's no competitive multiplayer, all of the focus was put into the coop which I personally prefer. The characters customization is pretty varied, male and female characters and a crap ton of gear that you unlock using currency and exp from playing in coop matches. roughly 25 or so items for each part of the body, head, arms, legs etc. and then a wide variety of skills that don't make any appearance in the single player portion of the game. It has a very similar feel to the single player, for example if one player decides to be loud and proud it doesn't mean that you have to be as well, you can remain silent and unseen by the enemy even if they are blasting their converted LMG into the heavens. Speaking of which the gun customization is all the same in the multiplayer but the system implemented makes it take far longer to unlock all of the guns, conversions, gear etc. because you unlock them via crates and don't directly choose what you want to unlock (although you can choose categories to unlock like attachements, vanity, weapons and such, but you just cant choose precisely what you want)  All in all im happy with the multiplayer, very good if playing with friends since you truly do need to rely on your allies to win since the game can be unforgivingly difficult, but that's not to say that randoms are no good, but obviously with no in game voice chat it's nice to have people you can talk to directly via TS or other means. Anyways with that being said I can confidently give the game a solid 8 now for very nice and replayable multiplayer.
1462	 My short review
1463	  A decent looking game with a few critical flaws.
1464	Pros: I enjoyed the game for the most part, Assassins creed like, post-apocalyptic Shooter. Capturing different areas, and building the resistance was fun for me. The weapon customization was kind of cool. RC Car grenade/Hack tool was a fun idea.   Cons:  THE BUGS! This Game was horribly optimized and buggy. I have a high end computer i7-5820K, 16Gb DDR4, and a GTX 970. Playing on a Med-High Settings it would lag out at parts dropping down to 10 FPS.  The game wasn\'t even finished, some of the safe houses glitched out and I literally had to look up work arounds to get into a safe house because the doors were glitched shut. (Ashegate Propaganda Depot) Multiple times I got stuck in areas that I couldn\'t get out of and had to restart the game.  When you customized the weapons it wouldn\'t save the configuration half the time.  The developers got very lazy with the GTK equipment; they all had the exact same upgrades for each device and you really only used 1 or 2.  My biggest complaint: On one of the last missions, you need to escort 2 trucks to different spots so you can shoot down some blimps. The truck was trying to path through a building!!! Eventually out of frustration I used explosives and got it unstuck, At which point it tried to drive through a broken car blocking the road. When I got close to it, It said I was out of the mission area.   Conclusion: I spent 18 hours on this game, and had an OK time doing it. But I couldnât even finish this game if I wanted to. Awesome concept, but please finish your game next time before releasing it. 
1465	For now, this game is still a construction site. Sorry for clear and honest words. It has potential. It theoretically is fun if you like the formula of Far Cry 3 and Far Cry 4. But there are a few heavy down-sides that kill the fun:  - Performance: As soon as I left the tutorial area, the performance went down. I usually get between constant 60 down to 40 fps. But as soon as this game hits 55 fps or less, it feels as if it goes down to 15. I tried all the settings in different combinations, playing on 1080p and 720p and I can't get this game to run smoothly on my rig (i7 4790k @ 4.4GHz, 16gb RAM, GTX 980, Win10 Pro x64).  - AI: Dumb as hell, they are running into my gunfire. 30 minutes of shooting, 200 killed enemies of which like 25-30 corpses stack up on one single pile within a doorframe and I knew: The AI is sadly broken. Buying a silencer and silenced boots at the beginning seem to be somewhat overpowered and allowed me to gun down a whole platoon within the very first hour of the game.  - Spawnpoints of enemies and mini-events: They spawn randomly. Everywhere. Even within a 15-meter-circle, I was able to run in circles between 3 mini-events to fulfil my 'get 100% of trust'-mission within 5 minutes. Also friends and foes tend to spawn right next to each other when war is going on. And after 30 minutes of defending a house, one enemy spawned right behind me within that hermetically sealed house as soon as I stepped out of the doorframe. That wasn't a pleasure.  In general, these issues aren't things that would make me say 'DAYUM, 'DIS GAME'S BROKEN, DUDE!' - but these 3 issues are the main reason why I couldn't truly enjoy my first 2 hours of this game. I'm diving into it a bit more and hope that there will soon be a bunch of bugfixes and patches. But for now, I simply can't recommend this game in it's current shape. The potential is there, but now is the time the devs have to show whether they're willing to use it or not.
1466	A flawed but ultimately enjoyable game.  I love the North Korean space ships that are flying over, looking for resistance.
1467	This is nowhere near as bad as people are making it out to be. This is just your standard open world shooter set in an alternate future where the North Koreans have taken over the US. There's elements from Just Cause 2, Far Cry 3, Assassin's Creed, Infamous and pretty much any open world game you've played in the last decade.  Average shooting controls, nice visuals, brain dead AI and a pretty lengthy campaign. Bargain bin type stuff, but not a total write off.  Full video review:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCPp3FX7R4A 
1468	Homefront 2 didn't interest me much. I finished the first one and it wasn't a good game. On the rails shooting gallery that felt too long even with its pathetic four hours of playtime. Second one wasn't developed by Kaos, but when I learnt that it's being cooked by Crytek UK, known as the muppets behind Haze, my enthusiasm didn't exactly grow. Plus all the trouble during development, bankruptcy of the publisher, change of dev team to Frankfurt, then back to UK, unpaid salaries of emplyoees, half the dev team leaving, then Deep Silver buying the project (followed by the return of the previously left devs, incl. game director Hasit Zala)...  No good game could have come out of this mess, could it ?  Well, according to reviews, no, it could not and it did not. For inexplicable reason (well..of course it was money) Deep Silver decided to release the game around 4 months before it was finished, at a time when console versions were almost unplayable due to low framerates, and PC version was a lottery ticket - one had it unplayable, the other could play, plagued by bugs. To Deep Silver's credit though, they allowed Dambusters (new name of Crytek UK aka Free Radical) to finish the game post-release, via some hardcore patching. Of course, the low sales and low review scores are set.  But, patch it they did!   First the technical side then. Homefront 2 looks fantastic, almost photorealistic at times. Cryengine has amazing lightning. War zones have, particularly at night, impressive atmosphere. Framerate is pretty much perfect now - 60fps maxed out in 1080p (on 2500K@4ghz, GTX1070) without any significant drops or stutters. There are some ocassional glitches here and there, a bit of pop-in, but nothing too distracting. The patches also added ability to tune HUD (turn off almost everything) and FoV.  Now on to the game itself. Unlike the first one, Revolution is much more open affair. It takes place in Philadelphia divided into multiple zones. These zones are either Red, where most of the battles against Korea took place (Revolution takes place 4 years after the US lost the war), so they are bombed out and reminded me of the 2029 scenes of Terminator 2 (Revolution also takes place in 2029, probably not a coincindence). These zones have great atmosphere and contain the FarCry/STALKER like gameplay with taking over bases and open combat against KPA armed forces. Yellow zones are full of civilians and instead of open combat, you need to play a guerilla rebel, taking out enemies stealthily. These most reminded me of City 17 from HL2 right after you arrive, except here you are an active saboteur, not just an observer. Thanks to these zones the game is nicely varied, it is not constantly the same killing gameplay all the time. Revolution has some very likeable sense for detail, you can see some here:  https://twitter.com/BlendoGames/status/776632296472313856   I like games that show their interface through ingame object - in STALKER it was PDA, in FarCry 2 you hand held the map, in Homefront you have a korean phone :) The arsenal is great. There are not many weapons, but each can be modified in multitude of ways and each upgrade feels worthwhile. The punch and feel of the guns is flawless, the sniper rifle is one of my favourites. You can transform guns completely, for example make uzi from a pistol, or a flamethrower from a crossbow. Plus there are bombs strapped to RC cars or teddy bears at your leisure.  The game surprised me. I only gave it a chance because of the free weekend and I ended up buying it and finishing it since I enjoyed it so much. I liked it significantly more than FarCry 4 or Division, which I played right before Homefront. That said, there are some flaws. The most significant one for me - the silent fu**ing protagonist. Oh how I hate this trope. There is even a moment in the game when another character shouted at me 'Say something Ethan!' and my lovely Ethan just looked, the mute idiot that he is. Please devs, stop with this nonsense. It is not adding to immersion. It is hurting it. Another flaw is that the AI could be better. Felt a bit too canon foddery at times. Too bad we will probably never see AI exceed or at least match what first FEAR offered in 2005.  Anyway. Great game. Give it a chance. Oh and that easter egg is effin' awesome.  Here are some gameplay vids I took:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bSG7au_RII  (red zone)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weXgxB3PevE  (yellow zone)
1469	At the beginning of the launch, the game was 'somewhat playable'. The performance issue was annoying, but still playable, there were moments that initiated huge FPS drops.  After the latest patch that the team was working on has finally made a game - the game. The game runs nicely on Ultra. They also updated a lot of other things and added GearScore (basically to show other players how 'advanced' of a player you are). The graphics of Cryengine is as always pleasing to the eye, and the textures in this game (guns, gloves, equipment etc.) look amazing.  With a on the move weapon customization you don't need to be worrying for bringing the wrong weapon to the field, as you can customize your gun in-game, just make sure you choose the right right class for yourself before initiating the mission.  They also added 2 free maps which are really nice, and pretty big size with of course new missions and objectives.  From this day on, do not let the 'MIXED' reviews to bother you. The game is great and surely needed sequel to Homefront series. And always make sure before buying games that your PC can handle it.  *Feel free to add me for coop or helping you to start up.
1470	Not sure, why everyone is hatin' this game. It's nice.
1471	I love this game so much, At its core it really is something fantastic but the buggy and terrible gameplay ruins all of it. The dependency on broken AI is too high, Why can't I take control instead of watch this AI walk into wall for 4 hours before taking another path? This game is great it really is but it's not worth the money in its current state. Wait til' they patch this 'thing'.
1472	I am so glad I didn't pre-order the 'Freedom Fighter Bundle'. So much framerates dropping and Bugs, way to go Devs.
1473	A missed opportunity.  I've played it for a bit and overall, its boring.  Its repetitive, falls utterly flat on is mechanics in more ways then you can see . The save system is Completely useless, and activates when you least needed it. And can utterly screw up you progress in game. The graphic/frame rate is a utter shame seeing as to how it optimized. The shooting mechanics are tedious and down right frustrating in critical situations.The story is underlay executed and wasted in half of the missions. Its a shoot this, break that repeat. Its like they took the far cry dynamics and stretched them out. Hell you can't even acquire enemy weapons. It a waste of a title.
1474	It took me 106 hours to complete. I will say this game was very fun! Very good combat and good choice of weapons. I played more stealth and with a hit and run strategy, take some things out and run! I think the way it was meant to be played. I think the story was good although the writing was a little weak, sort of like a B or B+ rated movie. I will admit I played on easy but for me (being 56 years old) it was just a right amount of AI and even still I needed to use a good strategy. I would recommend this game to any fan of FPS Iâm sure on hard or higher it will give you a very hard time.
1475	Playing this felt like a complete chor, at every stage I felt the game fighting back at my input. Even just basic movement was jerky and unresponsive. Gunplay was bland and overall not very satisfying.   I noticed pretty early on that the gun lowering on allies (Preventing you from shooting them) ended at about 10 metres or so and no one responded to it. On top of that, the loot you could scavenge off of them was the same as enemies, so you could get the same results for significantly less effort by just gunning down all your allies that spawn in safezones.  It's a shame, the setting was an interesting one. But there was very little story telling, you just sort of bumbled from point to point on your own (because allies are completely useless). It seems very much akin to Far Cry's idea of open worlds, just without a clear idea of what it is you should be doing.  I never thought I'd play a game that had managed to fail at virtually every aspect. Both the story and gameplay elements are dull and comletely forgettable.
1476	It's not terrible. Gun play is good, graphics are good, and it's all very fluid. The story is meh, and the acting is pretty meh too. It's fun in a 'I just want to go blow stuff up' kind of way.
1477	This is better than I thought it would be, if you can get past the stupid premise that North Korea invaded America and won somehow? According to Wikipedia 24 million people live in North Korea, 324 million live in Americaâ¦ hell North Korea couldnât even take over South Korea, they apparently have a population of 50 millionâ¦..so yeah stupid as f*ck.   China makes sense, they have a population of over 1 billion, but America wants that Chinese currency so they donât wanna p*ss them off in their media. The Red Dawn remake switched the invading force to North Korea as well (but they already filmed it with the Chinese as the enemy and just CGIâd the uniforms and such lol).  As for the gameplay, this is what Crysis 2 should have been. If youâve played any of the Crysis games this plays exactly like those. The gun sounds even sound similar, and they both use the Crytek engine. I would say itâs better than the 2nd and 3rd Crysis games.  This is open worldâ¦.ish. There are about 6 pretty big areas that you can run around in and take over by capturing strikepoints (think outposts from Far Cry). Itâs Far Cry mixed with Crysis. I really liked how most of the enemies donât take a lot of ammo to kill on normal difficulty, and die pretty fast. The actually adds a lot to immersion after playing games like The Division where it takes a week to kill a mofo.  Also, this looks amazing on high settings, most games that use the Crytek engine look amazing. Whatâs not so amazing is the performance, I got between 40 â 50 fps on high settings.  The characters and story are all meh, I managed to complete the story mode over the free weekendâ¦so I donât plan on buying it anytime soon lol. If you are a fan of the Crysis games I would recommend it though, if you arenât then maybe wait till itâs cheap.  P.S. There's a hidden arcade machine on the top floor of the prison area (where the two people in the cage fight) near the end of the game, which has two full levels of Timesplitters 2 you can play!!!
1478	It's a buggy game. Other than that, it's a good game but not worth wasting your money on. Wait for it to be on sale or wait till the developers releases a few patches to fix these bugs.
1479	Bought the game because I really enjoyed the first Homefront game. I regretted buying this one. It has many bugs and issues, such as out-of-sync audio, buggy AI, clunky controls both on foot and on the motorbike. The biggest issue I have is the Ashgate 'Hearts &amp; Mind' error which to be fixed requires you to delete your save and restart the whole game. After spending a good 10hrs to reach the Ashgate level I dont believe it is worth it anymore. If you are thinking of buying this game maybe hold off until the developers actually fix the issues.
1480	I reall wish there was a so-so button, instead of the like or dislike Option.  Because I really kinda liked the games at times and at other times I was soooo â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ for the many things that are wrong with the game.  So here the hard facts   Pro  + Setting : very cinematic dystopian USA , feels a little like Fallout  + Graphics : Raindrops falling, water puddles on the ground,  + challenging : This can be also be deemed negatively. Let's be warned you'll die a lot . Truth be told I'm not the best FPS gamer around, but I played on normal and I died countless times ( not as much as in Dark Souls though)  + the motorcycle: driving that motorcycle through town feels very realistic  + plays very smooth ( GTX 750ti ) with ZERO frame drops   Con   - Enemy AI : At times you can just walk past them and they won't really bother to do anything and at other times they will 'sense' you killed one of their own even if you killed them with no-one in sight and with the knife. Which will make them automatically go into alert mode. - Graphic glitches : e.g. Fellow rebels which obviously should be carrying a gun, but in reality there are just moving their empty hand with the trigger finger in the position of holding a gun. Enemies vanishing, citizens running into walls, enemies being able to see you through walls and hit you with a gun sometimes, ... - at times Tedious side missions : collect this, donate some cash to beggars, pull that lever in the enemy base, hacking terminals , still there are some big games out there that did worse.  - Story sometimes a little cliche ( won't spoil it)    I enjoyed playing the game because I enjoyed the setting and the combat system, although it felt unfair at times, with the enemies being able to hit me through walls and stuff. It feels and plays a little like a mix of METRO and Watch Dogs.  MUST BUY ? Hm depends on you, maybe you should be waiting until there are a few more patches released.   Honestly I don't think it deserves the mixed reviews it got. It's not bad. It's fun. Also I was talking with a friend and it seems that gamers who are using AMD graphical cards are the ones to experience performance problems mainly. So maybe if you are owning AMD, you should buy it on STEAM directly so you'll be able to return it in case it won't work  
1481	Not without it flaws, but very fun game nonetheless. It's basically a Far Cry in urban setting and that worked spectacularly for me. Fights are fun, gunplay is solid, bots are fairly stupid to abuse but still competent enough to fight.  World is divided in several regions that you will 'liberate' by hacking/blowing different objects of interest inside it, these regions can 'red' or 'yellow' zones, which I've found very interesting.  Red Zones are pretty large open areas with a lot of ruins and rubble, where enemies shoot on sight and your gameplay is mainly kill everybody and capture everything. Also ride on bike on every stairwell. Yellow Zones are more like City 17 in Half-Life 2. Building are mostly intact, there are lots of alleys, civilians and patrols. Fighting there is a little tricky, thanks to constant enemy reinforcements - you should run away and fight smart. Both zone types feel a little different while keeping focus and gameplay loop intact. That results in pretty varied but consistent experience, which is pretty hard for a sandbox. Maybe there will be a green zone, I haven't reached it yet.  Being pretty much happy with the game it the current state, I must mention that it is very clunky. It does suffer from the lack of polish you expect from AAA open-world games, but mainly because in a game of this scale there is a LOT you need to polish. Some voice actors are really dull, radio chatter is extensive, human models are pretty bad and it is a little buggy. From minor physics glitches to disappearing enemies on long distances.  And oh my god the intro sequence was horrendous. Cutscene, cutscene, walk, instant failure if you walk wrong, cutscene, walk, cutscene, loading, walking cutscene. You'll see all the flaws in this intro: bugs, clunkiness, bad acting, bad character models and it's pretty lengthy too. I do hope that intro won't scare you, because after that you'll be dropped inside a Red Zone and it's a great fun. With ruins you can run and bike inside, stronghold to capture, koreans to ambush and random flashpoints the game generates for you - it's really fun. Clunky, but fun... Funky?..  Also, there is a coop Resistance mode. It's... weaker, but still fun. Missions are heavily scripted and linear, while progression and loot systems are not very interesting. So I can't say there is a lot of replayability after you beat all missions on Hard. Which by the way IS hard, so you know, it's fine as a side activity.  In the end I can see why people was unhappy on the release of this game, but right now, without anything gamebreaking, with fixed performance and lowered price - this game is very, very solid.
1482	If you like the idea of running around and blowing people up with cool gadgets, this is the game for you.  I can't however with honesty recommend a game that breaks every single design rule I have learned. - A long, and I mean long cinematic and then period that you can't skip or do anything in. - 30 minutes until you do anything at all aside from hack a console that you are given no tutorial for but punished heavily when you fail (you take a lot of health damage - not that it's a big issue since it's pretty easy anyways once you figure out what to do). - AIs will constantly get in your way. About 10 minutes into the game, a civilian made me stuck between two doors causing me to glitch onto the roof then fall out of the map. - There is no clear effect for when you take damage. It looks like you are barely damaged and then you fall dead. - Enemies can run into the respawn area making you die repeatedly. - Enemies are in no way scaled to teach you the ropes. You will right off the bat be swarmed with enemies and APCs. - Speaking of which. If you see an APC and then go around the corner to bomb it. When you turn back, it is gone. Just poff. Very weird despawning. Even had a robot teleport from one side to another.  Now that is just the game design and some common sense rules that they break.  Aside from that, the game just doesn't feel responsive and they have some really ethically questionable stuff like teddy bears functioning as proximity mines. Because as wel know, toy bombs are weapons aimed at children, not soldiers. That's like a basic 'don't do it' of content design. It's not funny to joke about murdering children.  At its current state, I can only recommend it to people who just want something to play while waiting on other games. I recommend however that you wait until there is a discount.
1483	Not worth it. Wait for 50%+ off.
1484	Find an FOV calculator, enter in your desired horizontal FOV and then use the calculated vertical FOV number to set your FOV higher in the files.   Go to: (user name)\Saved Games\homefront2\game.cfg and open the file in Notepad.  Find the below text, which should be right at the top.  cl_defaultnearfov = 50 cl_fov = 50  The default vertical is set at 50. But I like to play it at 68, which is 100 horizontal FOV.  Save the file after the changes, boot up the game and enjoy your new perspective on the world.  --  The game itself though, I honestly find really enjoyable. I have not played another game that has really nailed the feeling of urban warfare and guerrilla tactics like Homefront: The Revolution has. You will frequently feel outmanned and outgunned, which I find incredibly refreshing compared to the mass of games that treat you like a super soldier.  The difficulty is no walk in the park either, even on Easy a shotgun to the face will kill you instantly if you aren't at full health. Again, I very much enjoy this kind of feeling where engagements have to be planned out and taken seriously.  The co-op is a real high point, adding a very positive team dynamic to the guerrilla warfare, but unfortunately it is pretty dead. This is a huge shame, as some of the best fun in the game can be found in these missions playing with other people and sharing the experience.   Bring friends for the great co-op or buy it just for the singleplayer.
1485	Well ..... i love the idea of the game and lets just say i have faith they will manage to fix all those bugs as i spent more time closing the game and re-loading and uninstall to just re-install the game. made me disappointed as i was eager to play this game and chosen tp pre purchase (HomefrontÂ®: The Revolution) than to go for another game .
1486	Really enjoying this game. Played both co-op and single playeer and have had zero issues with the game. Am I lucky I didn't buy it when it first released? Probably. I've followed the game for awhile and finally decided to make my purchased. I'm quite sure others that posted problems about their experience was valid. It is a risk we all take, and it is something we all will experience ourselves on making game purchases. The game-play for me feels a bit in-between Dying Light and Metro. The graphics are on the side of Metro and the play feels like Dying Light with on the climbing and looting for componants. Bots are a bit dingy. Not much help, and more in the way. They are not scripted to the story so there you go. Par-for-the-course. Sounds are good. Weather is awesome. I love seeing the rain begin and start to dampen the sidewalk. That detail was something I don't ever recall seeing in a game before. Usually it just begins raining and tada!, its wet! Story and acting is primo! Very well done. UI is simple and has most of what you need in regards to tuning your game right. Like with most games the story doesn't seem to be that long, but you add-in the side-quest or just (like me) going for that 'completionist' set' the game will last for awhile. I would say get it if your unsure. Make sure all your drivers are utd. Enjoy! No regrets and I'm happy with my purchase. Rig is; CPU i7-5930@ 3.5ghz, mobo Asus X99 Deluxe, 16g Corsiar DDR4 LPX 2666, 1T Samusung TLC EVO SSD, Corsair i1200AX psu, EVGA 980 GTX.
1487	Worst 60$ I ever spent!  Apart from performance issues, I got stuck on last mission 'SAM Security'. Stupid driver keeps crashing into obstacles! So I didn't even finish this buggy game!  CPU: Core i7-6700K @ 4.5 GHz VGA: Gigabyte GeForce GTX 980Ti Xtreme Gaming WaterForce
1488	Homefront: The Revolution follows what's known as the Far Cry Formula. So basicly it's a open world shooter with a bunch of side activities to do apart from the main missions. So if you like the Far Cry Games (FC2-FC4) (FC1 doesn't actually follow this open world formula, which the other Far Cry Games do), there is a good chance you'll like this aswell. However I don't think it can live quiet up to the Far Cry Games. But that's enough comparison to the Far Cry Franchise.  The game is running on one of the more recent versions of the Cry-Engine. So it looks pretty good. Not quiet as good as Crysis 3, but close. I like the design of the Environment. I think it pictures very realisticly how a destroyed American City would actually look like.  The Shooter mechanics work just fine thoughout the game.  The game is set in Philadelphia in the year 2027. Two years, after North Korea invaded the USA. The main story is entertaining, but nothing particularly special. However I think the story telling outside of the actual main story is done pretty well. you can find letters from people, both american and korean throughout the city, where you can read more of the story of individuals during the war. simular to how you can find journal entries and stuff on terminals in fallout games that will tell you more little stories that happened in this fictional world.  So yes it's a good game. But if you are not particularly looking for this dirty somewhat realistic war setting of the near future and you have not played all the Far Cry Games yet, than these may be worth to take a look at aswell.
1489	Never pre-ordering a game again. I paid an outrageous amount of money to download 35.5 GB worth of data that is a waste of space on my hard drive.  So poorly optimized, it's unplayable.
1490	Homefront The Revolution is a heavily flawed game.  The first Homefront was a CoD copy and not even a good one. Homefront The Revolution plays like Far Cry 3 and 4 but without a great story or memorable missions.   How to free the checkpoints is the only thing HTR does better than FC 3+4. In the Ubishooters you have to climb towers over and over again. In HTR you have to complete different objectives, like killing certain targets or hack a computer but here the developers made some mistakes too: One computer was hidden in a building and I found a different way to it. I could have easily jumped up and climbed through the window but was forced to take a different route to it. Funny that I could jump out of that window to get back on the streets. On another checkpoint I could have climbed over a fence but wasn't able to do so. I had to climb up on another building and jump on the rooftop.   The modular weapon system may have been a great idea on the paper but the Crysis trilogy does it a lot better. In HTR it just takes too much time to switch the weapons and the enemies take way too much bullets even with the upgraded guns. The programmers said that you are no CoD hero but why do I still have to kill dozens of enemies per mission? Many of the main story missions didn't feel much different than your average CoD massmurdering.   The story itself is also very weak: You play as a guy named Brady who doesn't speak and gets mixed up in the resistance where you are some sort of John Connor because you alone can do what dozens of other fighters can't and you have your Resistance buddies like the typical leader, the nice doctor and a female psycho. Oh and there is a traitor too! Surprise!  What the game does get right however is the atmosphere. When you start in a yellow zone the people are depressed and the KPA shows up just everywhere. The more you liberate the zone the more the people will rise up and you can actually see it. First there are some people protesting and later on the start to kill the KPA and the whole zone atmosphere changes.   But that is also the only cool thing about the game. The rest just feels mediocre and in the final mission you even have some heavy bugs. You have to escort two vehicles but they can get stuck. First time on some debris the second time on each other. Had to exit to the main menu to avoid the first bug and the second time when the car didn't continue and dozens of enemies spawned from nowhere I got killed but when I reloaded the checkpoint the car continued. Totally annoying!   Overall this game is boring and repetitive and brings nothing new to the shooter genre. It copies heavily from other games but doesn't even get that right.  So I really can't recommened this game.
1491	I'm usually not reviewing games, but I love this game!   The storyline is pretty good tbh. The freeroam gameplay is also good. The normal gameplay looks a bit like Dying Light; the way of running + there's a bit freerunning in it.   Lip sync is not so good, but I think that that isnt a big deal.    + Good Storyline + Smooth Gameplay + A lot of fun to play  - Bad Lipsync - Sometimes the just won't load   
1492	What a disapointment. Been waiting for this game and all i can say is why did i bother?  My computer is way above recomended spec and still only getting mid 20's frame rate. Game play feel sloppy and choppy. After playing the division this game seems old clunky. The game needs alot more development to get to a properly playable level.  SImply put dont waste your money and if you want a shooter of a similar style get 'The division' instead, much more polish and fun to play.  So far the only game i have ever put in for a refund on.
1493	After much debate I ended up getting this game. This was before the Patch Two.  ( If you are reading this and are debating on playing, the games fps issues are very very smoothed out IMO and many bugs are fixed. On my end I have had ZERO bugs )  So when I first got it I was plagued with the crazy fps issues. Blah blah the game rolls on and finally Patch 2 comes out.   Amazing. For me, I have everything on very high besides shadows. With a sweetfx setting for 'DPX cinema' only which really lifens the game up! 40-45 fps here for me with the very rare dip in heavy heavy combat.  The game is pretty intense depedning how you play. I love it. Theres many ways to deal with enemies, scenarios or you can do hit and run guerilla tactics instead of the usal BAMBAMBAMBAM kill them all style. The cutscenes are SUPBERB, the environments are great. In my opinion the npcs are pretty repetitive in their day to day banter, I wish we could hear some more game lore and hear some tragedies or atrocities the Norks have commited.   So......... Gameplay? epic. Visual? epic ( you will def need to play with them i youre on a medium end rig this game is gpu based) Story? Pretty good.   People are very picky. The game needed some time to grow up, which it did and its very good. Definite reccomend
1494	Concept sounds good, execution..... kind of like playing a 5 USD unity FPS game. The game has great potental, but don't spend your money quite yet. The mechanics and concept is pretty good, shooting and movement is clunky, and online Co-op is kind of boring. Single player is a bit more entertaining, but still in a buggy not launch ready state. Wait and give this game sometime before droping that 60 USD on this.
1495	Homefront the Revolution is a post apocalyptic game set in the realms of philadelphia attempting to tell the story of survival and rebelion under a ruthless and oppressive enemy or so you would think. The story is very lackluster with no real sense of making a diffrence to the people who inhabit the game world, there is zero emotion to be felt with Homefront the Revolution which is a shame as again another AAA game chooses a real possible scenario as the backdrop to there game but it carries no weight in terms of emotion or caring for the person (character) next to you. The story or main campaign is easily one of the most forgettable stories i have played the only thing i remember is getting frustrated with the hearts and minds parts of the game which is very tedious and repetitive. Combat in Homefront the Revolution is very unsatisfying the game is an FPS game but has none of the fundementals of an FPS game FoV is limited to 65 i would like at the very least 90 there is no dual sensitivity for hipfire and aimed fire. There is a few bugs in the game and a lot of cut corners. You cant even freeroam after the main story is complete so if you missed things in the game like side quests you have to start the game again.  There is a co-op section in the game which was fun for a little bit but what i dont understand is why for a couple of co-op missions there is so much in terms of character customization and weapons when there is no multiplayer, there is certain attachments for weapons like the suppresor for your assault rifle which you can only use on your assault rifle in co-op mode and not in the main game.   There is a lot of cons with this game and not enough pros to justify giving it a positive review which is unfortunate as it could of been such a great game that i could of been quite happy to sink alot of hours into but after 14 hours the main story is complete and so are the co-op missions and there is no desire to go back and play it again so as it stands its an over priced ballon that quickly deflates and i wouldnt recommend this game and would suggest either waiting for a sale or investing in another game. So sadly its a thumbs down for this one.
1496	Even with a decent PC (GTX970 and a second gen i7) This game is optimised terribly. Even when turing every setting down to low I can't even hold a steady 60fps. The shooting feels terrible, inacurate, and jerky, along with enemies feeling very bullet spoungy.  I actually love the setting, and was hoping for something like another Freedom Fighters with this, but it's such a â¥â¥â¥â¥ poor attempt, avoid this game.
1497	terrible performance
1498	Have anyone the same problem as me ? On pc the aiming feels so console like(no offence to people on consoles),its hardly playble for me that i cant hit a damm KPA soldier right in front of me, is there any way to turn it off or to change the layout of controls ?Also i feel so robbed for pre ordering the game like all i get is a skin for my motorbike and pistol and some stuff for level 5 in coop for my trust in this game.Also the poor performance which kills the game for most players.
1499	 holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ this games just so bad, its story and 'lolstealth' mechanics lowered my iq by at least 10 points   Okay, let's look at this another way:  This game  cannot  be worth its full price. Seriously. It's a full-priced FPS which has innate Mouse Acceleration, FOV cap at 65, no options for toggling ADS...  And it literally just plays like Call of Duty with a  â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ier  plot. At the very least, the Modern Warfare games felt like playing through some bombastic Michael Bay flick, this game feels like I'm playing through a film that Zack Snyder directed after he got stoned, played Half Life 2, watched Red Dawn, and decided: 'hey, i can make something like this'. The plot is stupidly over the top -- and the worst part is that it takes itself way too seriously to the point of pretension.  Guys, Doom is out. The New Wolfenstein's  been  out. Buy those instead.  And if you'd rather Call of Duty, just play whatever CoD you're playing now. It's probably better than this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
1500	This game is not worth playing. You feel like you are doing the same thing over and over again. Do not buy this game, save your money for another game. It is not worth the 60$.
1501	I have no idea why people give this game a bad rep. I have played only the single player campaign and not touched the multiplayer. So far, I'm having a good time with this. Sure, it's a little rough on the edges, but every good game has it's quirks. The thing I like most in this game is the overall difficulty. This isn't some run of the mill FPS where you can run around and start gunning people down. You have to be careful and think what you do. Stealth is the key in many places and because this game runs like Far Cry in many ways, you have to loot bodies and stuff to get some valuables to sell. With money you can buy attachments to your weapons and better gear for your character, like kneepads that makes you faster while crouching and backpack that hold's more loot. Guns can be modified on the fly, just like in Crysis and that's really nice feature in this game. It runs on Cryengine so expect the same machine requirements.  Overall, this isn't a bad game! Get it if you can from Steam sales or somewhere else. I could have bought this from the getgo if I would have knew this game is this fun to play.
1502	Gameplay is horrible, poorly optimized on PC...you'd think after 5 years in the making this thing would run better than DOOM. Refund is pending...
1503	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME... COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY. DEVELOPERS AND PUBLISHERS SHOULD BE ASHAMED TO RELEASE SUCH A GAME!!!
1504	So much potential so when it falls it falls hard
1505	I have read may bad reviews for this game, but I enjoyed it very much. I thought the story was interesting. I like the setting and the feeling of having to avoid the guards, and play hide and seek. I did hit a few things with the AI acting strange, but not enough to stop my enjoyment. I will admit I only played the single player game, and doing the hearts and minds of each zone was the same, but the map made it somewhat interesting. Maybe I'm just not picky enough.  I thought it was well worth my 60 bucks, and I can only hope they do another one. I didn't reinvint the wheel, but I didn't expect it to. It's a good solid shooter, with a good enviroment. I thought the graphics were good, and I liked the fact it made the zones easier the more you captured of it. I felt part of the Revolution without making me some type of Superman.  If you want a fun ride just enjoy the game, but it's not going to change your life or how you see FPSs.
1506	Call me a sucker, for expecting much more from this pile of sh..! If you like unfinished games, than this game is for you...  -Really bad Optimization, almost all players experience FPS drops, and to be blunt this game doesn`t look really that pretty! -Chunky Controls, sometimes unresponsive, pretty hard to aim w/o the aim assist (and I`m never using this) -Horrible Lightning, Glitchy fire particles but man, does the shadows look bad and glitchy...awful. -Audio glitches, peeping the whole mission the hiddens stash, after I found and looted it, well it`s not my idea of a FUN! And there is no music at all - Just some ambient loop crap! -Repetitive Gameplay, not bad but nothing new. Side missions are really easy, playing on the hardest btw..There are at least 10 games with better gameplay. -Story sux hard! Pretty dumb, bad acting...audio mash-up from radio msg, 'main story' and some random people deciding to speak some uninteresting bullcrap.  It is really a shame, because I was expecting this game to be in my top Games this year.  I`m still playing it thou, but we`ll see how much more I can endure this abbomination.
1507	  Ten minute intro scene is a bit much :D After that you get control, it plays a bit like an urban Far Cry, the Koreans have occupied the USA and you are part of the resistance. You get to ride a bike early on, with somewhat clunky controls, the FOV can't be made larger than 65Â° so you have a very limited vision as well. I wanted to make a first impression video like I do with all my games, but after I checked to see if it recorded well, the recording froze :/ Wasted an hour of recording, and screw it, I'm not gonna try again. The game's not fun anyway.  Also they need to use more character models, saw two resistance twins having a conversation, maybe they are supposed to be twins, but I doubt that, was pretty funny tho At least it runs smooth on my GTX 1080 Skylake beast, no problems playing here, it does heat up my rig, that's usually how I can tell if a game is demanding, as they all run smooth lol and there is still that recording issue of course. Anyway if you like to see some first impression vids of random steam games, check out my YouTube:  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZBJJtaPXEeCubP-2YPKk4g 
1508	It turned out to be a great game as soon as I leaned how to avoid getting killed by an airship or drone. The system recommendations are definitely off. The graphics are great and will run a smooth 100-120FPS on 2x SLI GTX 970s with a couple setting turned back to high but it will drop below 45FPS and get choppy with everything on ultra. I highly recommend this game, just know that it takes some serious hardware to truly enjoy it.
1509	Thanks to the developers at Dambusters and Publisher Deep Silver for providing a really fun new IP for me to enjoy and escape.  As one of my most anticipated FPS games this year I never faltered even after a middling beta(I didn't play) and middling reviews(suckers buy games day one) I did my usual.I sat back relaxed and played other games while it received a few patches, updates and a price drop where I was comfortable and upon completion what different gaming universe do I live in? Homefront TR is part Dying Light, Fallout, The Division, Half-Life 2, and Far Cry and while it doesn't achieve greatness as some of those titles it does the next best thing, it provides a helluva lot of fun in both single player and surprising co op gameplay.  Lets talk about performance since everyone today seems to go ballistic if there is a minor issue. During gameplay I had all options set to high including V-sync,playing at 2560x1080 and never had any frame rate(60+), crashes or game breaking issues. In game I did notice enemies would disappear in the distance on occasion and some minor sound outages but game play for the most part is fast and solid. I Also noticed if you downsized the game to the toolbar and brought it back up you would need to restart the game as it just seems to chug. Its an open world game where minor hic cups will exsist and if you dont know that by now stop playing them.  Homefront begins with one of the most brutal opening seqences I can remember it's very disturbing and cringe worthy as are some of the melee kills and just scenes of violence. You are cast as the typical silent protagonist Ethan Brady who arrives to the front lines of the resistance for a meeting with their leader Benjamin Walker. Walker is captured during this meet and greet and this sets up the main story and thrusts you straight into the world of the revolution where North Korea(the Norks as they are called) has taken over the US due to unpaid gas bills. The story is split into 4 acts and it doesn't give a very good first impression but if you hang in there the voice work, mo cap and some moments have feeling but because you are mute with no opinion you just follow orders, whether right or wrong. HUGE problem for the story and huge mistake by the devs but overall its not bad.  While the game bills itself as open world its really divided into three zones. The green and yellow zones are the heart of the enemy and where they are they strongest. The environments are clean and is militarized with constant enemy patrols. This is also where most of the regular population resides and these patrols, scanners, cameras and drones have a constant presence and stealth is required. The red zone is more chaotic, open and war torn. The buildings are bombed out, roads are an obstacle course of carnage and the resistance actually has a small advantage if any. This is where you can freely roam with a gun in the open, easily recruit resistance members to help with missions and you will also be given the ability to use a motorcycle to get around. Breaking these areas up into these zones keeps gameplay from being stagnant and was a great decision by the devs.   In these zones you will be given the usual main or side open world missions which involve sabotage, reconnaissance, retrieval, investigation, etc. All are familiar but depending on the objective and zone there are a lot of ways to approach each mission and end goal. This approach is highlighted by outstanding level(world) design and the tools at your disposal. One additional task you will be given in each zone is to make the people 'rise up' or as its called in game win 'hearts and minds'. This is mandatory as some missions and zones will stay locked until you reach 100% resistance for that particular zone. Increasing resistance can be accomplished by turning on radios know as the voice of freedom, completing flash missions, liberating strategic sites, saving civilians, assassinating targets, or just blowing stuff up. I can't tell you how awesome this feature is especially as the resistance grows NPCs begin to act different, say different things and it truly feels you are impacting the world and that's pretty cool a definite highlight for the game.   One thing absolutely clear at the start is you are underpowered and its highlighted with limited weapons, gadgets and amount of damage you absorb before falling. It makes sense the resistance is underpowered and the weapons and guerrilla tool kits(GTK) have a unique home made feel which is another cool highlight. However, being able to purchase GTKs and scarce resources at the store is sort of confusing. Every weapon you purchase except the RPG can be converted into 3 weapons and all have different attachments. The animations for the weapon conversions are cool and the weapons themselves are solid, a lot of fun and in some cases a little too good(hello auto matic shotgun). There are also 4 GTks you can equip at all times that include hacking, molotovs, pipe bombs, and firecracker. All of these base GTKs can be converted and then used as a remote(use smart phone to detonate), proximity(land mine), or driven on on an RC car and detonated. As you explore the world you will also be scrounging parts or finding hidden stashes to build gadgets and a reason being able to purchase them at the store is a mistake.   As for the world of Homefront its beautiful though it doesn't look like a Cryengine game in some aspects. Graphically it doesnt compare to the likes of The Diviions but it equals it with its attention to detail. Every room, alley, street, tunnel, and bombed out building all look unique it's really impressive and it makes exploring so much fun. Character models on the other hand look impressive as do animations and mo cap.   The absolute biggest suprise in Homefront are the co op missions. A co op vetern with my friend Silver(15+ co op adventures) we absolutely loved this mode. There are 10 missions(2-4 players) that are mulit mission based and avg. about 15-25 minutes each. As it was in single player you begin bare bones and are very vulnerable at the start so a little grinding is necesary. The level cap is only 6 and money(at various prices) is then used to unlock chests which give you armor, consumbles, guns, attachments. As you gain XP and DNA you can then spend them in 4 skill trees labeled Brains, Brawn, fighter, Survivor. None of the trees differentiate themselves and once you have maxed your charcter and skills you are unable to respec those points. All that said its fanatstic co op fun and challenging.   Homefront is a pretty ambitious game that has been through the ringer of development and unfortunately due to bad release it has been killed by the casual reviewers polluting the industry. Dambusters did not waiver and have continued to provide patches, updates and support. I like the game its not perfect and maybe it was too big for this small team but its provided dozens of hours of fun and that's all I ever ask out of a game.   I played the game with m/kb 2560x1080 High setting on Deathwish difficulty  Positives Great Atmosphere world feels lived in Solid 60FPS performance 1080P(2560x1080) high settings Fun gameplay all around Great level design. Multiple paths offer choice on how to approach objectives Mo cap and acting is pretty good, story is ok Hearts and Minds and watching change is unique and awesome Weapons and GTKs are a lot of fun to use Suprising and addicting mission based co op   Negatives Slow start does not give a good first impression  Enemy and variety is very lacking. Also I hated more of my comrades than any of the NKs Poor sound and graphic optimization Can't use phone/map while on motorcycle You are a mute with no opinion Being able to purchase GTKs and resources at the store makes no sense A few bugs and obvious game would have benefited with another 6-12 months of development 
1510	This game is a little bit of Far Cry and a little bit of...well it's a lot like Far Cry. Based on that if you like/love Far Cry then you'll enjoy this game. I've played two hours and so far have had a blast freeing civilians, taking down enemy positions and upgrading my weapons.  You can choose to sneak or blast your way through most enemy encampments which is nice and depending on which weapons you buy either of those can be done much easier. The protagonist is silent but honestly I don't mind it, Gordon Freeman and Doom Guy don't talk so now I can put my own thoughts in the characters head.  Running on a GTX 980 with an Intel i7 and 16 Gigs of RAM = No problems with loading anything, game runs fine. I've also installed on an SSD so that probably helps as well.
1511	Pros: Pretty decent story, awesome gun customization, cool exploration, and nice map layout. Cons: Shooting sucks especially aim assist it doesnt put the crosshair on the target more likely on the side of the target causeing you to miss shots, recruits are always in the way of your line of fire and you cannot give them orders to move to certain points. IF this game was to suppose to be tactical your recruits run all over the place making it hard to sneak or perform silent take downs. (note the cons are from a single player stand point.) I would recommend waiting till game has been patched up fixing some of thses issues otherwise prepare to be angry and put thumbs down, 
1512	Worst decision ever made: Ignoring reviews and purchasing a pre-ALPHA quality game  Best decision ever made: REFUND!!!
1513	Don't waste your money on this title... It's not worthy a single penny! Buy something else from it...
1514	It had potential, IF the game would have been how they advertised it... right now it feels like a beta.. many grafical glitches, fps drops, getting stuck in weird places, etc... after 2 hours it felt like i had already done it all and it got boring.. real fast. also in those 2 hours i had unlocked all the weapons but one + their secondarys and all the attachments... for now, I do not recommend it. mayby when it is on sale and after a few patches... then maybe..
1515	game run good, at least for me and yes for very high settings, story is good, but the coop really i want more for this price i expect more staffs like coop mission and not only 4 stages, more level rank not only level 6. for 60 euro no the game is no worth it :( for 30 euro meaby yes. if devs give more to this game i vote good. now no
1516	I feel for a game souly based on shooting, the gunplay and way the weapons handle are garbage, and thats coming from someone with a ton of experience with fps games. Also, the voice acting is non-believable and garbage. For an 'Open World' game its extremely linear and doesnt allow you yo freeroam at all. I pre-ordered this believing that maybe this homefront would turn around this series, but unfortunatly, it has let me down once again. I wouldn't even pay $30 let alone $60. I would definitly not buy this game, unless its on a serious sale.
1517	I haven't played a lot of this game, and the reason being is I just can't stand the bad optimization, gameplay, voice acting, AI and story. Gun customization is pretty decent, but I don't think anyone is going to buy this game just for the guns. I know everyone keeps saying this, but it has such great potential, and the concept is amazing, but the way they executed it was just horrible. It's simply not a good game, and it's not worth 59,99 euros.
1518	...sigh I had this on my radar for a long while now, and when I saw the 'free weekend' offer I knew I had to try it. I've sunk a lot of hours into this game this weekend and feel I have enough experience in it to make a judgement on the game. If you played the first Homefront, there's not much in common here other than it's the rag-tag US vs. THEM gameplay from the first. But the first game may as well not even existed because nothing from the first story carried over. Maybe the name of the 'main' leader you are trying to rescue, but that's about it. Simply put, this is a first-person shooter where you are an American rebel fighting a guerilla war against an occupying Korean Military force. That's about all the 'story' you get. You get thrown into the fray pretty quickly without hardly any hand-holding. This can be a good thing for mechanics that anyone familiar with playing a fps should be used to, but the game needs to have a much deeper tutorial on the aspects of the game that are different from the generic shooter. The game is severaly lacking in telling you how to use the map correctly, which 'opprotunities' are more important than others, and explaining why you can't modify your weapon into the cooler choices or why so many of the upgrade choices are greyed out and not even attainable until you are halfway through the game and have meet a certain story mark (ie scripted section). I learned that I could recruit AI rebels to assist me, but they do much more harm than good. First of all, you can't give them any commands what-so-ever and secondly they do nothing but get in %$&amp;@#*(%! way. I have died several times because AI GI-Joe would push me out of cover as they stole my position. They also will lock you in behind objects, walls and doorays and the only way I could get the idiots to move out of my way was to kill them or sometimes disbanding them. Since you have no control over them, you don't get to choose who they shoot at or when. Trying to sneak up on the an enemy base with them is pointless because they start shooting (very badly I might add) at the first bad guy they spot 2000 yards away. Even that is pointless because for some reason the enemy they shoot at become super bullet sponges that seem to take round after round from my AI guys but they can take my guys out in 2 shots. They don't use cover, except to push me out of mine, they don't use tactics, unless you consider running out in the open past multiple cover spots, screaming patriotic â¥â¥â¥â¥ and firing (and missing) at a group of enemy AI that outnumber them 10 to 1 and getting killed. Not only are they ineffective, but their actions cause the enemy to pursue me all over the map because the idiot rebel AI doesn't understand when it is losing. They never retreat, which is odd because the enemy AI will use retreating and flanking actions when they come under fire. The game is also very brutal with the deaths. 2 to 3 shots and you are dead. This would be fine and great if the game modeled everything else related to infantry combat realisticly, but in this case the 2 to 3 hits and your dead is just annoying. When you die you spawn at the nearest friendly area, loose all valuables you picked up and any work you may have put in.(I guess none of your valuable 'recruits' would have thought to retrieve and of your things). Say you wiped out 25 guys and a couple drone machines and got killed with one half-shot up bad guy left... You run back to the area not more than 10 seconds later and everything is 'restocked' with full enemies. Oh, and back to 'your' friendlies, they don't offer medical help, they don't offer ammo, they don't engage anyone killing you, they just go off in Rambo mode in their own little world and just do their thing. Story wise the game is just boring and so cliched it hurts. You become like a God to the rebels just for pulling off a few missions. I seriously heard a brain dead AI female rebel gushing over with her friend as if I smiled at her or not. These are supposed to be hardened rebels who have been at war and endured a hard-â¥â¥â¥ life for some time now, not a bunch of teenage pop-star fans who get starry-eyed at the new guy who completed one mission successfully. It just feels fake and overly pandering to the player. I can't put my finger on what feels so wrong with the actual mechanics of the shooting gameplay, but it just feels weak. Weapons feel like BB guns, killing a bad guy just feels really ho-hum and nothing you do seems to matter because you have 'HQ' screaming in your ear ever 5 damn seconds to go support this AI group or that AI group. How about letting me concentrate on my actual objective you said was so darn important instead of sending 10 miles in the opposite direction to secure a pointless magazine of bullets? So 25 innocent people dying from a bombing is less important than 30 rounds of ammo some idiot left behind? According to AI/HQ and their 'Strike mission' mentality, yes. Early on I believed them and would hustle to the area where the AI was supposedly getting run over and people would just be hanging out talking about the latest gossip. Then once I would get within a 'trigger' area, suddenly the bad guys would show up. So it's all scripted BS made to feel like it's dynamic. Oh, here is another nag. You are given a phone. On said phone is a mission roster, a map, a camera and a thing I call the 'beeping annoyance from hell'. You are given the minimal instruction on the functions, not anything about the camera. The camera is sopposed to automagically identify bad guys, and you are supposed to be able to take pictures I assume to send to HQ. Not once have I been instructed or told what the camera does, or how to get the photos to actually do anything. I did take a 'job' offer posted on a bulletin board that said I needed to take photos of an enemy convoy. No waypoints, no idea where said convoy might be. I ran all over the place for a solid hour looking for this supposed convoy... Never found it (Yes I checked the map). So, I thought maybe if I sneak up on an enemy base and take some photos that will help HQ? Hahahaa. Apparently the camera function only works for very scripted missions. Since I took the job 'too early' in the game, the convoys were showing up yet so I couldn't complete the job anyway. And the beeping transponder? It's supposed to show you where a cache of supplies are, but several times I would get to said cache, and take as much stuff as I could, but either through a glitch or poor implementation, if I didn't pick-up every single cache item there was, the transponder would keep beeping every few seconds and not 'clear' that I had gotten to said cache. A few times I would find a 'journal', basicalyl a wall of text that shows up on your magic phone, and that would clear the transponder, but at least twice I went to a cache and there was no 'journal' to pick-up so the darn thing would never shut-up or clear the location.  TL:DR Game is a scripted pile of crap that pretends to be dynamically played out. An 8-year old can see through the fake scripting in 15 minutes. Your AI are an annoyance who do not help, actually they do more damage than good, and have the emotional maturity of a teenage pop-star idol girl.  I give this game a 5 out of 10. A big fat 'Meh' It's been awhile since a games broken mechnics have actually made me mad. Well done Homefront, you â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ me off pretty good.
1519	I liked the earlier Homefront and was semi hyped for this game. The game fell a bit short and is just average, not anything special. I hope they fix some stuff in the game just for their pride, it's not going to make this game good even if would have no bugs at all.  Plus points: +The shooting mechanics are decent/okay +Gun customization is nice +The single player length is 10+ hours +Possibly more to play in multiplayer/co-op +At the hardest difficulty the AI offers a decent challenge  Minus points: -Graphics -Dull story -Bad vehicle (bike) mechanics -Bad performance -Lots of bugs on release -The final mission is really buggy, takes many tries to complete just because X's are getting stuck. (X= would be considered as a spoiler) -throughout the game they have used the exact same mechanic for hacking, no increasing challenge -The health mechanic are kinda stupid: firstly you take no damage at all and then you just lose 95% of it by one shot of enemy sniper
1520	it was fun but it only took me like 6 hours to finish the game
1521	This game is a pile of crap! If these are the triple-A games coming out in 2016, There is no hope for game companies.  * Could not recommend this.
1522	not a bad game, the gunplay is decent and everything feels like it has a kick to it like it should, not like the laser pointers we get in most fps the gadgets are decent especially the remote controlled cars with bombs, the graphics are good with a few bugs once in a while with the lighting but only happened twice in 3 and a half hours of play. I would really recommend this game if you enjoyed the past farcry games or the previous homefront game, this game is like farcry in a destroyed city but alittle bit less bullet spongey as you die faster so its good to recruit rebels to fight with you max 3 at a time, one thing I dont like alot is the motercycle driving which is completely impractical because of all the terrain obstacles that stop you from really going far, story is not amazing but serviceable and the characters are generic but I wouldnt play this for that anyways, would recommend if you can find it on sale for like 70% off as you should get your moneys worth from that. I should also note that I run it on maxed settings on my gtx 970 and 980m at 55-60 fps with v sync on, sometimes it dips to the high 40s on especially hectic moments but rarely.  7.5/10
1523	I've really enjoyed this game. I was looking for a fun FPS to play and it delivered. Sure the story could be a bit better and the gameplay got somewhat repetitive closer to the end, but overall, I loved it!  I would love to see DLC content from the Homefront team.  So many negative reviews of this game made me reluctant to get it in the beginning. I'm glad I finally did.  I can see myself playing this again on a harder difficulty level. I just wish the stealth was more developed.
1524	I liked the game; even with the choppy gameplay and short DLC length, which they could've and should've made longer. I loved riding around on the motorcycle and blowing up KPA convoys in the Red Zones.
1525	  The game feels so awesome though i dont see why this game is beeing trashed because its rly alot of fun. I so love the story! The way you walk to the way you shoot! From me they get a thumbs up.
1526	this game is a turd  delivered nothing what they said this game was about
1527	I had a good time with it. You're looking at around 20 hours give or take worth of content if you're willing to deal with frustrating ai and doing the same objective over and over again. To be fair, it gives you a lot of ways to takle objectives, which i loved. In one part i had to release a prisoner with 2 heavies and a armored convoy nearby. I set up remote decoys ahead of time and approached from a different direction. When the convoy passed i remotely activated the decoys, rushed in and hacked the panels to let the prisoner out, only to have to fight my way out and run. If this game gets something right is the feeling of being chased. In an actual scale of 1 - 10 where anything lower than 7 is â¥â¥â¥â¥ i would give this a 6/10. Super fun.
1528	  both this game and this studio deserve another chance  played it during the free days and had a genuine blast. No doubt it's riddled with minor bugs and it still needs some overall polish, but it's way better than i thought.  A free demo on steam/XBL/PSN would do wonders for it's sales IMO.
1529	  Far Cry clone in urban territory. Boring.  Dumb ai.
1530	  Played through the entire game over the Free Weekend, and unfortunately it's just not that good of a game. It doesn't have anything that really makes it stand out or makes up for the number of crashes and other bugs it has.  I think the developers honestly tried, but it just didn't work out. Although, when I say developers, I mean everyone except the writers. The plot is subpar at absolute best, and straight up stupid at several points.  Overall, you never really feel involved in the revolution, combined with bugs and rather average gameplay, it all just falls apart. Maybe pick it up if it's 5-10 USD.
1531	I was happy to see Homefront 2 coming out. Happy enough to pre-order (which I don't usually do). It had an interesting setting, story was so-so and over acted (so was the original Homefront -- it was to be expected). But the more I played this game, the excitement diminished more and more and frustration took its place. It wasn't frustrating because it was difficult or challenging. No, it was frustrating because there were so many stupid things to deal with. Either bad design, random puzzle mechanics (especially those where the mechanics were not properly introduced or apparent), ugly dev shortcuts (patrols randomly popping into view?), and bugs. As another reviewer stated, you could start seeing the âcracksâ appear. The story, the acting, that all would've been forgiveable. But the engine was ridiculous.   I understand the issues with development and changing hands and all that, but when you take a game and patch it only to make it worse, you really have to question what is going on. Some of those changes were not even needed, yet the developers messed with them and screw it up even more.   I recorded my playthrough and put it on YouTube, but by the end of the series, I was basically muttering âthis is so stupidâ the entire time.   The multiplayer is okay, but not worth the hassles you have to go through to paly it. If you can actually find a game, you have to hope that youâre a decent enough player to not fail the mission for your team. And of course, you have to hope that you get decent teammates. Itâs not bad if you have to exit a game because of those issues, but it takes forever to find enough players for a game you could spend your entire âgaming timeâ allotment sitting there waiting. the multiplayer is nothing like the original Homefront.   And on that note, the guns/shooting/etc feels nothing like the original Homefront. Those had some good feeling to it, but Homefront 2... man...  Summary: Do not buy it at full price (terrible mistake on my part). Buy it at around $5.99 USD (okay, maybe $8.99) for some fun that you can jump out of when it gets tedious. Or better yet, watch it on YouTube.
1532	This is good game  I like the Spirit of the revolution Good Graphics Open World FPS Recommend buy this game while Winter Full DLC  
1533	  Played this game during the free weekend, and I made through the whole main story in 24 hours. I'm not saying it's bad but it's also not good, just mediocre. The story is predictable and repetitive in several ways, the enemies are just a bunch of idiots running around, and there seems to be some kind of a weird bug that sometimes make some NPCs disappear into thin air. At least I didn't put 60 bucks into this game went it first launched.
1534	I am a huge fan of the Far Cry series. If you are too, then this game is for you. It has a few issues here and there but nothing major. Nothing game breaking. The game gets tense when you are being chased in the red zone on low health, whilst trying to find somewhere to hide. The game is not 10/10 but it is good enough that you will enjoy it immensly if you enjoyed Far cry.   Get it on sale if you must. Such a shame it had a very dodgy laynch. Patch 2.0 fixed it all apprently and I have not seen anything game breaking.  The multiplayer is fantastic. Objective-based Co-Op missions. Nothing addictive mind you, but good enough to jump into every now and then.
1535	Ran into issues like cant mount a bike. Some capture points are greyed out forever. AI is a bit stupid at times.  But overall i've been hooked to the game
1536	  Played during the free weekend.  PROS: It's like FarCry 3, but in the city, but not really open world; Good graphics;  CONS: The first was better; Weak plot; The main character has zero personality; Very repetitive.
1537	One of my favorite games is freedom fighters. I wanted to like this game since its so alike but with all the crashing and freezing I get, can't say I'm going to be buying this (playing it via free to play weekend). Maybe I'll buy it at gamestop in a year or two for the ps4, should be playable and cheap after that.
1538	  This game by far is the most mixed review I have ever though of.  Long story short... Pro: Nice open worled Good apocolyptic atmosephere Cool guns and customization Nice graphics  Neutral: Generic patriotic story line Voice acting isn't top notch Shooting isn't very clean  Cons: Sloppy driving Quite a lot of performance issues Uncleaned bugs which ruin the experience Repetitive gameplay(Destiny like) Boring story progression Forgettable campaing(Said to be 20 hours long)  I came into the game with zero expectations and came out with really mixed thoughts. It a unpolished sequel to Homefront which feels like Destiny but in a apocolyptic modern take.  I only played like an hour and got bored because of the Cons listed. 
1539	  Thank god it was free to play. Do not waste your money on this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥.
1540	  It was nice to try this game for free. I'm really sorry to say this, but now I know for sure that I won't buy this game ever. - Terrible AI - Pretty boring single player - But worst of all huge FPS drops
1541	To be completely honest, this game isn't up to par with the original game. Sure, it looks nice, and the freeplay environment is cool, but somehow, they managed to make the gunplay worse than the original game's. Converting weapons on the fly is cool and everything, but realisticly, it's too fast and the changes that are made are sometimes quite rediculous. Also some conversions are just â¥â¥â¥â¥. Convert your sniper rifle into a firework cannon? Nope, do not do that. You'll have better luck with a grenade or you know, an actual rocket launcher. The online game is pretty just the missions from singleplayer(sure they're different missions, but they play out the same. No freeplay online, its just mission after mission and theres really not that many missions to play. Also, the online is dead already, so don't expect to actually get to play online if that â¥â¥â¥â¥ Bottom line, I bought the game to see if it was really as â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ as everyone said it was. I can confirm it's pretty bad, but probably not quite as bad as everyone else says. Buy this game if you want to play another Far Cry esque game and would like it in some 'The United States has been invaded and you, the most patriotic of patriots would rather die than let those â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Koreans win' kind of perspective. 8/10 Concept wise, 3/10 gameplay wise, 0/10 multiplayer, and 1/10 for optimsation and polish. Overall, I'd say its about a 3.5/10
1542	this game is non stop bugs and glitches, the gameplay is blan and boring. the AI are absolutely stupid as hell, the slient protagonist makes you feel like youre a mime with a gun, and somehow you completely get out of a torture room by doing absolutely nothing but keeping quiet... this game is a great concept and great elements, but falls entirely short with HORRIBLE Bug problems, glitches, and a game with absolutely no depth.
1543	  One of the most intros i've ever seen! graphics are stunning, i'll be honest, i was a bit afraid the gameplay would be bad but nope! it's awesome, the driving is a bit wierd tho but i like it :p
1544	First 5 mins playing the game and welllllllllllllllll.......... The sound's a very bad, shots at the window you can see but not hear, you can hear sounds before things even happened (eg i heard a gun shot then 20 sec someone get's shot with no sound) the lip sync is all out of order, the lips move for about 5 sec then you start to hear what the people are even saying, The game freezes 4 times within 5 mins... and that is just the start of it  2/10 lets hop the update for the fixes will be soon
1545	Not worth the 60â¬ original price, neither is it worth 30â¬. This game is at best a 15â¬ game in my opinion. I expected it to be a great mix of known games like Division (Haven't played), Metro (10/10), latest Far Cries (Man of the people, fighting the revolution etc.). I bought the game solely because of seeing how the graphics were and what the theme was. Sadly I have to say, this game's story is a major lackluster.   In terms of mechanics, imagine the Devs are sitting in their kitchen, they have this Pot full of boiling water that has 'Mechanics' written on it. It is meant to be the Mechanics soup. What they did there, they decided that peeling the ingredients for this soup, would be a waste of time and simply took them raw as they were and threw them in the pot, expecting their soup to taste the same. Little to their knowledge, soup tastes like garbage now and they totally should've spent more time on each ingredient. Stealth mechanic is below basic, Weapon customization is half-done(you're gonna reach end-game gear really quick and you won't have to grind for it, in fact you will have too much cash left over sitting there doing nothing useful for you), Core gameplay lies in the amount of bullets you put into your enemy and where you shoot. Its as simple as that. The mechanics of this game are nothing special, and some are even worse than any of their competitors not just by a little bit but by a lot.    Expect this game to be short-lived in your library. The whole story took me as much as I will ever play it. No, I did not complete every single objective, Cause simply these objectives had literally 0 use, but yes I did complete a major part of them like 50%. You can rush through the main story-line brainlessly and you're not going to miss out on anything, mainly because side-quests are nothing more but eye-candy.    Character development sucks, although I'm not really criticizing that aspect in the games enough to explain it well enough. Other reviews have done a good job of describing how it is.   
1546	By the time you realize how disappointing this game actually is, you're beyond the point of refunding the game.
1547	  I've just downloaded 40 gigs of meh. I would like to comment on the main story but I kept getting distracted by 'reestablish that radiostation' or 'reclaim that house'. I liked the female sidekick - that is all. Jesus Christ, thanks God for the free wkdn game because I was flirting with the idea to buy this game. It's not a BAD game, it's just painfully avarage.   I would advise only buying if seriously discounted.   
1548	I wanted this to be a good game, and it may have been a few years ago. Now, however, it's simply not polished enough to warrant a $60 price tag.
1549	Good game, great, modern, realistic FPS, nice design (actually, I expected something of this level for Fallout 4), interesting concept, but only partially developed. The game feels incomplete at times, but I had a great time and the bugs didn't, not once, impede a good gaming experience. The hate probably comes from the early players. At this stage, Homefront is superior to most games around (even at this stage, I should say). It's rare to see good single-player games these days, but this is one of them. There are problems, as I said, but I didn't care much about them. I'd say there are more opportunities than problems. The game beginning presents an awesome concept which keeps you asking for more, but there is little of the same quality for the rest of the game. I could play the game at around 50-55 fps, there are some frame drops, but they never took place during crucial moments, so, despite there being room for improvement, the experience is nonetheless amazing. I think the game is worth 40hrs of enjoyment, I have explored only to some extent the multiplayer, which seemed very entertaining, but lacking diversity - I suppose that it will continue in this state, after all the marketing failures of the game. I had a great time, I applaud the effort to produce a complex single-player game, and I do recommend it with the above minor qualifications.
1550	It's been a ride finishing up this game. I must admit, this game will not win game of the year. However. Homefront: The Revolution is not a bad game. It's not great, but it isnt bad. Probably because of all the problems this game had, this game could have been more. There are good fun features in this game, but they are poorly executed. Story is 'okay', but not interesting. I loved the first Homefront, but this one...doesn't go much in the background or story. It feels like doing a shore. Liberating area's seems fun for the first two area's, afterwards it seems pretty much the same thing. It seems like some things were simplified, and that seemed like it was just for 'speeding up' the proces. It's not a good game, but it's not a bad one either. I do like the voice actors, and they do try their best to create a homefront world. But it just doesn't feel right. I want to say this game was worth it, but it just doesn't feel so. Great sound effects, great music. The gameplay is 'okay', story was dissapointing, but it wasn't 'bad'. I love the game, but it missed a lot of greatness. I rate this game a 6/10. But i can not recommend this game at full price. Wait for a sale, and then maybe sure.
1551	Like some I waited until I'd heard there had been a major patch to address the bugs this game is known for. Waited for a discount day and decided I'd try this. I was pleasantly surprised. The gunplay is well done and I had a lot of fun with the weapon customization. It didn't always make sense (like converting a sniper rifle/DMR into a rocket launcher) but there was a wide variety of weapons and equipment to choose from and play with. The type of game where you see a group of enemies headed your way and spend 10-20 seconds deciding how you want to dispatch them each time.  Was the game bug free? Absolutely not. The wreckage of enemy drones or humvee's would often glitch out right as I could tell the game had timed them to explode. Some of narrative stalls due to glitchy npc's, and there is a checkpoint scene where you follow a line of 4 or so people past a desk. I had to reload that part about 8 times to get the npc's to walk forward when they were supposed to and not just randomly stop which prevented the scene from progressing. Sometimes enemies would see/detect you through solid objects like police barriers when you couldn't see them. So they definitely don't have everything worked out, but I was able to brush most of this off and still have fun.  The story was nothing impressive although there was plenty to do. My current time played (36h) is one play through, though I'll admit I took a semi-completionist route to get about 90% of the weapons/items unlocked. And I did find the premise of this alternate reality where North Korea has developed all the best technology in the world an entertaining one. Basically the same route Wolfenstein: TNO took but...with far less polish and using N Koreans as a modern-day villain equivalent.  If I was as pessimistic as a lot of these other reviewers (but still objective) I'd give this a 6/10. Optimistically an 8/10. So a 7 is probably realistic and fair for this game overall. Either way I'd recommend trying it. On a sale day of course.
1552	Played it during the Free Weekend period. The game looks beautiful and ran pretty well, so the updates the developers have been pumping out seem to be working based on launch problems we've all read.  The shooting itself felt a little lifeless and the A.I. can be dodgy sometimes but the gameplay it solid and the atmosphere great.  They did a great job of showing you a war-torn Phili and the oppressed lives of the Americans that live there. Voice work was top notch and I can't wait to buy and jump back in once I get tired of Legion.  The Multipler Co-op mode is pretty neat with lots of options for customization and character building. If you have 3 other friends that are willing to pick the game up, I highly recommend checking it out.
1553	Nice cinematic and fps experience. One small con is the control and feedback of riding motorcycles.
1554	I had the change to try the game during a free weekend event. All in all I think not every negative review is justified and the game can be fun. Think of it as the following game mix: Far Cry 3 missions and movement set in a dystopian scenario using the typical Crysis engine and weapon modification features.  Story / Missions: The missions are not very innovative and can be copied 1:1 from Far Cry 3. Kill/destroy, defend, collect, use/hack. It can get boring to hack another console for the 100 time, but if you liked to simply stray in FC3, you might also like it here. I can't say much about the story, but from what I've seen it's more like a no brainer. More like a medium to get you through the scenario. Dont't expect crazy drug dreams like in FC3. So don't play it if you expect much story.  Maps / Levels: The game has no big open world map like FC3, more like about 7 bigger levels with tasks. Each area has a distinctive look, although the alltogether look similar due to the destruction of the city (ruins, kinda grey). What i like about those semi-open-world levels is that most actions change the level. Buildings look different, when you liberate them. You can even notice more and more rebels moving around or civilians revolting, which is nice for the atmosphere. In the end, if you begin the real rebellion in a sector it starts to look more like a warzone.  Graphics: The game is by far not ugly. It sometimes looks very 'Call of Duty' / grey-in-grey mid day. But I guess thats only realistic in cities. Sunrise and sundown look very nice and give a nice touch of colors to the greyness of mid day. The night is usually really dark, so you need your flashlight (think pitch black darnkess like in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. with mods). So in the end the graphics are atmospheric considering the scenario.  AI: Quite dumb. More like Call of Duty AI / quantity instead of quality.  TL;DR: Mix Far Cry 3 with Crysis set in a dystopian scenario without much story. If you liked doing mischief in FC3, give it a try. But don't play it for story.
1555	Its really just not that bad, not worth full price but not at all deserving the hate it has gotten.  Will review more with time played
1556	  Ok so I played this for Steam Weekend It really was not that bad I ran a solid 60fps after optimizing through Nvidias driver. The gameplay is pretty generic but otherwise it can be fun for a while.The gun customization comes from the crysis series. Played a bit of the coop mode it was a mission based kind of thing complete objectives and extract. I liked the game I always thought the premise of the game was interesting North Korea vs The USA. This game defintely is not worth the high price though wait for a sale something under 20 the story is not very enaging but man do those graphics impress.  [8/10 Would Play Again]
1557	Bad game. The story is just horrible and the gameplay is bad. Graphics are not acceptable with that performance.  The performance was supposed to be fixed by now, but it's not. I get enough FPS (70-80) but it still lags.   In total I would give this 2,5/10. It's not worth playing as there is nothing original about this game, and compared to others it's just a failure.
1558	I have to admit, even after the patches, the game has serious bugs that 'bugged' me out (see what I did there?). But in truth, the game feels good. It took me 3 days to finnish, capturing all stuff and getting all stuff but it felt necessary, many games have those collectibles that many people don't care about, but Homefront has a way of making it feel necessary to have them, and so, as a non collectible guy, I collected everything, don't ask. As for the story, it could be worse, but it could also be better lacking the emotional stuff of certain games. with all the sacrifice around, I could feel a little bit more attached to the characters but perhaps it was my fault for being around doing run'n'shoot :/ There is a character that I HATE, who is the sadistic Dana. She looks like a b**ch, acts like one, and talks like one. Just something I have to get out my chest.  Now I have to tell you something about a VERY frustrating mission called 'Goliath Online!'    In the mission, you will have the escort of a Goliath that fires explosive rounds. Do yourself a favor and don't get in line between the Goliath and the enemies or YOU WILL DIE. You can thank me later (or not)     Homefront includes TimeSplitters 2 in an arcade machine on the prison zone. Don't know if it has other 'mini-games' but it this made me vote for the 'Game within a game' Steam Award  Overall I'd say it's a 6/10 game. Not good, not bad but somewhere that could be better with some more work, polish and better actors. Just sayin'
1559	This game has gotten a bad rep based on the state of the game back when it was released but I am here to assure you that the developers have made some astronomical fixes that have made this game not only enjoyable, but one of the best open world FPS on the market. I'm gonna be blunt, this game is not easy and if the only FPS experience you have is Call of Duty than this game might not be for you...BUT if you enjoy realistic shooters that actually make you think and come up with a game plan before you go in, than this game is perfect. If you enjoyed any of the Metro games or any games in the S.T.A.L.K.E.R series than pick this bad boy up.
1560	I dont really understand why there was so much hate for this game. I mean when the game launched it was full of bugs and performance issues, so was fallout but nobod complained. The only thing diffrent would be that this game was ok. Doesnt really do anything special so it kinda feels like a knockoff farcry but farcry was fun and so is this. So i would say is to wait for a sale and buy it and see for yourself.
1561	Ok so this is actually a pretty good game. It's definitely overpriced at 40$. I got it on sale for 12$. I'd say i would def. pay 20$ for it. I think the marketing for the game was somewhat poor since it's actually pretty good.   It plays a lot of Far Cry 3 and Red Faction: Guerrila but it's non-open world. Rather you have multiple hubs you get to explore, scavange supplies and pick off 'Norcs' (North Korean Military).   Collect supplies. Hack relays. Shoot Norcs. Unlock upgrades. Unlock safehouses. Progress through Story (which they made into alt-history reaching as far back as the 1970s.)   So far so good! Definitely recommend if you like Far Cry and Red Faction style gameplay with a Deus Ex-like environment hubs.
1562	A fun FPS with a ridiculous fictional story. Perfect for killing a weekend.
1563	This could be a masterpiece 10 years ago, but pretty much a piece of 'I've played this in other games mutiple times' work now.
1564	  Hmmm, what to say about this......Well the game looks pretty (but we all know that good graphics do not necessarily make a good game) the shooting mechanics seem solid and fun but there doesn't seem to be much structure to the gameplay. After the initial getting to know everyone stage, the game sends you on a mission and then BAM all of a sudden the map is filled with so many things to do you forgot what you were supposed to be doing, so you head towards the nearest marker thinking that is where you need to go to finish your current mission only to find that you have just started a new side mission instead...  I don't mind games giving you loots to do but not before you are familiar with a few mechanics first.  I am still going to recommend this game but only if you love being swamped with things to do before you have enough knowledge about how to accomplish anything.
1565	I really wish Valve would stop letting these people plaster Co-op on any game that has the slightest ounce of multiplayer mode, this has absolutely no campaign based co-op therefore it is 'not' co-op in the sense most people expect, it is 'only' an online multiplayer game where you rinse and repeat as part of a  team...COD/Battlefield  etc..same old same old. Fun still but a lost opportunity. Recommended due to the price I paid, just over Â£7 squid and will no doubt enjoy the single player for that price. Full price and I would have been â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
1566	I've had fun so far, plesantly surprised! :)
1567	I found the game and campaign as well as the multiplayer to be very fun with high replay value. HOWEVER the amount of glitches and performance problems make the game a nightmare to some which lowers the replay value down. So even though I really do like the game I will have to say 'don't buy it'.
1568	  Not entirely sure why people are ragging this game. It's not terrible, yes; I did get it for free this weekend, but ultimately, I bought it.  The gameplay isn't bad, the only thing is the sensitivity of the gun play, but that's fixed by decreasing sensitivity. The upgrades and attachments are wicked, you only have to buy one of the attachment to attach it to all guns. You quickly get cash to unlock and buy equipment.  It is open world, where just like Fallout, you can do what you want when you want all while completing the main story.
1569	With some small additions to the stealth aspect of the game, could have been much better; had my fun with it, plus they downgra... -ahem, patched it to run nice now.
1570	For a game with such hatred, I enjoyed every moment of it!  -Gameplay is amazing and highly resembles FarCry 3 aswell as has graphics and parkour style like Dying Light. -The story is not bad but it isnt as crazy as some other games, the story is more pinned towards you seeing both sides of a war where one has soldiers just like another -Over all its a great game for gameplay and the story is pretty good aswell HIGHLY RECOMMEND
1571	It took a while for patching to make the game playable, but after 1.7 it went from unplayable to very playable. It's not a perfect game by any stretch, but I highly recommend it.   Note that i am a fan of the core Far Cry series, FC 2,3,4 as well as Arma. Those are the kinds of games I like to play.  Here's why Homefront The Revolution is a good game, for me... and maybe you...  1. They nailed philly and post invasion occupation. If you ever wanted to star in your own 'Reds' movie, this is it.   2. The whole premise, which starts with the Military in the US being disabled via hacking, is within the realm of possibility, say 30 years down the road.  3. The technological advanced machines the Koreans have in the game, if you project say 20-30 years ahead, are entirely plausable.  4. The enjoyment of this game, the immersion of it, went way up when I shut the Mini-map off. Recommend you do the same. It's all in settings and is easy to do.  5. The sound in the game is pretty good, sounds of occupation. It grows as the population is stirred up. Really adds to the immersion. I like to shut off the music unless I am really feeling 'cinematic'. But normally, I like the music off which adds immersion IMHO.  6. I have not finished the game but I am several hours into it. DON'T JUDGE THE GAME BY THE FIRST YELLOW AND RED ZONE you work. The game gets increasingly more exciting after a while. You will feel like you are a fugitive from justice.  7. There are a ton of side missions to do along the way, or stick with the main thread. I started my playing with medium difficulty and hud on, focusing on the main mission 'cause I was getting my butt kicked. Then I stopped the game, and began a new one, this time on hardest, no mini map (love it off!), and pursue all teh side missions.    And so this is why I enjoy playing this game.  There are some things I wish were better however: a. You can upgrade your guns, bombs etc... but the way you obtain them is by accumulating cash (or something called 'KPA points').   The whole thing about using cash for weapon upgrades just strikes me as totally non-immersive. Look, you're in a rag-tag group of resistance fighters, where you and your copatriots live in poverty... and you will become a big deal in teh resistence.,.. but you need money for weapons? I'd rather they use something like the 'renown' system found in silent hunter... if ya know what that is... they do use something called KPA points, but they can onl;y be used on certain items and not your main weapons.  This is not a fatal flaw, but one that just strikes me as silly each time I purchase an upgrade....  b. As a fan of the far cry series FC 2,3,4, the protagonist speaks a few words here and there in those games. Not a lot, but enough to feel like your character is a human. In Home Front, you are always silent, even when you woudl expect something to be said (I won't spoil it for you....).  This is not a major flaw as most of the time you are doing what freedom fighters do so well... and I suspect it was about budget, why we don't have that in the game. But just a little character talking on even rare occasions would have made the story more real.  Some have been critical of the story.. and it doesn't quite equal what you get in Far Cry ... still it plays a part in the journey and glues together the pieces in to a whole. I give the story a B.   ====================  Conclusion - as I said earlier - if you want to be in your own Reds movie (the original, not the sucky newer one...), and want to experience the feeling of taking back your community and your nation from an occupying force, I highly recommend this game for you.
1572	Dudes, I think this game's got way too much miscredit. I guess its the 'reverse hypetrain'.  The game isnt brilliant (as in 8.5-9+ in Gamespot/IGN) but it certainly, in my experience, isnt a failed game eighter.   What it sets out to portrait: An occupied america where you play as a tiny part of the opposition, it accomplishes fairly well. Sure, theres no huge set-pieces or surprising advances in gameplay. But, its solid.  As performance goes, its acutally one of this years 'demanding' games which runs better on my maschine. And, its a very humble potato: 12ram, i7, Nvida 900-somthing 4GBram, an old carrot' 1gb hdd w. some ssd sprayed on top.   -it handles this without one (1!) single hickup. Period. No stuttering. No do-hickeys or but..wrinckles. And if the measly performance and huge issues at launch is to believed, then Cudos to the devs. for fixing this and ACTUALLY Care for their product.  Some of the big-wig' companies could learn from that.   My only caveat with this one is the graphic style. Why, in all the Nordic Gods' names, do we have to get served those 'slightly cartoonish' graphics. When surely the same effort and coding could have given us near picture-perfect graphics. Its just distracting and I cant help but catching myself dreaming and imagining how Philadelphia would have looked in 'true to life' graphic style; dilapidated and worn down; bruised and burnt by firefights; defecated upon by thousands.  - Lennon would have fired up a pipe', but I linger on in game'.  /Dr. Mabuse,  Gaming since the 1980'ties C-64 days and never getting enough. 
1573	i cant tell if they wrote these resistance characters with a straight face or tounge in cheek but they were some of the least likeable characters in any game i have ever played.   north korea did nothing wrong, gas the resistance.  gameplay was ok however
1574	This game overall isnt worth sixty dollars, however the gameplay mechanics were interesting and fun. My most enjoyable moments were overthrowing certain districts from kpa authority and the gun customization was interesting and fun as well. However the bugs are prevelant through out the entire game, such as npc's getting stuck in the floor or running into walls all the time, and an escort mission i had to do 3 times, because the truck got stuck on debris. This game just isnt finished all the way, it needs ai updates for it to be better. The story is mediocre at best.   TLDR: Wait till it is on sale or the price drops to buy, it isnt worth 60 dollars.
1575	Dissapointed ... Many bugs in the game like a getting stuck in the walls when you take takefowns in doors ... The game stops running and freezze many times during the game play. Poor SLI optymalisation with low usage og 2nd GPU Poor AI ... That`s not a open world game since enemy`s appear suddenly and people in the streets dissapear ... 6 Houers of game play and I had â¥â¥â¥â¥ing enough ...  How do I get the refound ?
1576	worst pre purchase i've ever made ,  and i've pre purchased games like watch dogs ;(
1577	bad performance. fps usually drop down and my spec: i7-4790k gtx 980ti 16gb ram poor graphic in spite of cryengine
1578	Gameplay is OK, graphics are great, but AI is pretty stupid. Overall i think the game is decent.  7/10
1579	-The gunplay doesn't feel good and is not accurate. I ended up hip shooting most of the time instead of aiming down the ironsights because it is to hard to hit anyone. It does make the game hard and frustrating. The stealth part of the gameplay is annoying since the AI have super good vision and spot you most of the time but doing a stealth kill takedown can be fun. Driving the motorcycle is hard to control and gets caught on the terrain in a matter of seconds. I ended up running on foot most of the time because of it.   The story is very boring and not interesting. The voice acting is terrible and the AI isn't smart. Overall it feels really repetitive and generic. They should of made the game linear like the first Homefront instead of open world. It would be better off that way instead of fetching for things going back and forth which gets old really quick. They could of focused more on the gameplay and story that way.
1580	absolutely rubbish 1/10
1581	Well I am going to absolutely honest here I have accessed so far the 4th part of the city into the game within the 2 hours (slightly over 2 hours actually) of gameplay I have actually played in this game.   I firstly must say I been looking forward to this game since it was first announced and I played the first Homefront. I have read the reviews from others and other major sites. I can honestly say the only negative thing I can personally find in this game is optimization.  Gameplay and graphics were spot on in my opinion and even though I set my expectations low because I didn't expect it to even release after waiting so long with no news. I am extremely appreciated of the fact they brought everything I honestly expected in the game. Story is pretty good so far and I have no complaints and the gameplay and the feel of the game is very good.  Optimization as I mention is the only downside of this. I did update to the latest drivers in hopes for SLI to work with this game since it was provided in the latest drivers by Nvidia, but it seems SLI does not work for this game. So I am only able to get on high settings across the board (nearly maxed settings, but not quite there) and I achieve a stable framerate around 90 FPS constantly through my playthrough of the game. Of course when I attempted max settings the frames were so unstable and plummeted to nothingness when it is maxed out. This would be the only downside, but the game only just released so I am not going to gripe about it because of that and will wait and see for future updates.  As for other negative reviews and the reviews from IGN, etc. I honestly would suggest others to take it with a grain of salt. I would honestly give this game an easy 8.5 for the quality gameplay, story and experience this game has given. Which I personally find very enjoyable right now and I like the game and for those who enjoyed Far Cry or any type of shooter game this is great.  I love how many options this game gives you for upgradability and changing out your weapons which is a great feature to the game and a pretty decent game changer. I also enjoy the challenge it brings and how you can roam the world without a gun always on your screen. I look forward to unlocking further 'yellow zones' and other things. I was also a huge fan of 'Freedom Fighters' that came out during the good Playstation 2 days. I personally find this game a good successor of both it and the Homefront series and hope to see more like it in the future (with better optimization and graphics).   As I said don't take negative reviews of this game to seriously. Take this game as it was advertised during E3 and your expectations because it truly delivers and offers a good experience for a open world first person shooter.
1582	I really enjoyed the game, it wasn't such a smooth experience as say Far Cry 3 and 4.  But it was a nice challenge (for me) and you don't really end up like a one man army like Far Cry, you die in a few shots just like your enemies.  It was simply a fun game.  Oh and it ran smoothly 60 fps all game long, it was great. (GTX 970)
1583	  Played enough of it while it was free to get a good idea of what this game is all about. If you are a fan of Dying Light and the like I think you'll dig this. No zombies though.
1584	Îne of the best games I've played till now. And within the steam and outside. The Playthrough was an endless experience and there were incredible changes to the events . Amazing graphics,amazing reflections, super clean and very detailed shadows. Also , technical area of Homefront: The Revolution is the one who played the leading role in my experience . Looking however below the stack of amazing technical matters , I met a stress filled and inspiring story , extreme realistic gameplay mechanisms and a highly trial campaign.  - WARNING.. if you dont have a 250$ or better graphics card dont even buy it.It wont play even at the low settings. With my ( r9 380 ) barely playing at high settings and got rarely fps drop.Te game also want 5 GB of RAM
1585	Although there are many issues with this game, overall it is still a very enjoyable experience and well worth the reduced price of $27. I recommend it, but not for full price.
1586	Its sort of fun in a nutshell.  Has the feeling/gameplay type like far cry 3/4.. you know the so called allied. Those allies not doing anything but yet showing up after the battle to have the stones to take credit for taking credit and then wanting your help. Just like.. far cry 3.  AI sucks though on your side of course, the enemies hack through walls maybe 25-30% of the time so they'll see you through it some how. Or they'll just spawn like directly behind you. Which is annoying as all can get out. No major bugs but I got it when they've probably fixed most of what others had in the beginning plus for 20$.. Its worth it probably. I say 20 cause I got it cheaper with steam wallet.  Also even though I recommend it I doubt there will be a third. Considering that the first homefront botched its release by bugginess and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ campaign. Now this one being the exact same on launch day with having problems. So.. pretty sure sales on both and reviews at the start have killed the franchise.
1587	  I like this game even if there are many animation bugs and there are models like cars that has low detail.  The free peried has ended too soon :(
1588	massivly improved from the original release. Plays a lot like Far Cry 3 or STALKER, and offers a lot of challenge.
1589	Don't have much playtime on the game but I'm gonna throw my two cents in about the port. Currently running a 770 and this game runs at 55-60 FPS for me on maximum. This is a midrange card from 2013 or so running a new game that looks pretty good in some places at a decent framerate. After the dumpster fire that was this game's launch, I've honestly never seen a turnaround on a game like this one. Very well optimized, and it's a free weekend, so it's worth trying out at the very least. From what I can tell it's like a smaller-scale Far Cry 3/4 with a by the numbers story of getting revenge on invading forces. Guns feel pretty good to control, vehicles don't feel too bad either. I can see this game becoming a pretty good 'Get it on sale' game.
1590	  While the game was free for the weekend I decided to test it considering well can't turn down free stuff right depending on what may be free that is lol.   While the game absolutely runs smooth for me only issue is in my whole playing time thus far which idk atm haha, game itself has frozen 12 times literally...  While this game resembles parts of Farcry, it well idk it does a horrible job at telling a story really. Like literally you supposedly just join the revolution 3 days beforehand and get to meet this great person only to hear hes been kidnapped and the people who recruited you are killed. I suppose the remainder of the game is rescue the fearless leader who you just manage to miss every single time lol.   Sadly the character you play doesn't speak at all... which really doesn't get me involved into the story much kinda like The Division.  This games freezing reminds me of Batman Arkham Knight just saying which till this day I don't think it's fully fixed and probably never will be lol.  Oh yeah you magically know how to swap guns into other variants I guess you some how learned that on the first three days which you don't play lol.   While it's on the sale, I would say it's a good buy but at full price I myself won't and not going to buy while it's on sale due to the multiple freezes.  Though I will say thank you to the Dev/Publisher for the free demo of the game and that's why I'll go ahead and make it positive. If only I could get a free demo of Hitman Prologue Episode :P
1591	Hacking System Look Better Than Wa*** Do* I love Design Of The Map I love This Game it Worth The Money If You Ask Me
1592	Loving the game so far!!! It was really well done and a lot of fun to play! Looking great on the gtx 970
1593	I avoided this game in the beginning after hearing so many terrible reviews due to optimization. However, after playing it over the free weekend, I immediately bought it. The game runs smooth as glass, the graphics and gameplay are both great, it's not a massive system hog, and the story is actually very good and quite long. It took about 30 hours to beat. The co-op play is a lot of fun as well and finally you can play a game with friends without having to be amped up on cocaine and Red Bull to have enough reflexes just to kill something.  The story is quite a bit of a stretch, what with the US being beholden to North Korea for its technology and finances. Yes, you will need to suspend reality a bit to enjoy it, but it IS enjoyable. I have a sneaking suspicion that originally it was about China, but possibly due to real-world political and PR fallout they decided to substitute China for North Korea. This is just my opinion and speculation. Think of it more of an alternate reality than an actual cold war Red Dawn scenario, where there really was a credible fear of a Soviet attack.  All in all, I give it an 8.5 out of 10. I would give it a 9, but I would have liked more weapons in the game. Yes, I do like the system of customization and cannabilizing weapons for parts to create new upgrades, but I would have liked to do that with different types of rifles and submachine guns, not just an AR-15 that turns into a SAW and a pistol that turns into some half-â¥â¥â¥ SMG. Also, being unable to pick up enemies' weapons is pretty lame, although I guess it could be argued that they would all have electronic trigger locks for each individual. Finally, I would have liked to have more accessories, such as silencers for the sniper rifle. It's not a big deal, but it would've added more to the stealth aspect, which is lacking. But, then again, you're a resistance fighter, not a ninja.  The obvious parallels to Far Cry are there, with the only real difference being there is no vehicle usage in the game. I actually kinda liked that, because it's not very realistic that the average resistance fighter would know how to drive a futuristic North Korean tank.  Finally, I'm very excited that they're planning DLCs in the form of both Co-Op multiplayer maps and big single player maps as well. I will be keeping this game on my hard drive for a while, and I might just replay the single player again. It's a lot of fun and you would be missing out on a great experience if you don't buy this massively (at least now) underrated game. If you like FPS games but despise the spastic 11-year-old â¥â¥â¥â¥-talking CoD scene, get this game.   Is it worth the full price? Yes, in my opinion. Others may disagree but I think 50 bucks is fair for this game, especially since it runs so well now.  Is it worth the sale price? Absolutely. It would be criminal to overlook it on sale.
1594	The story is kinda simple, the gameplay isn't 100% new. But honestly this game is just really fun. There's so many different ways to play the co-op, pretty varied level variety, and just generally dependable entertainment. 
1595	Overall this is a great game gg
1596	finished the Storyline during the free Steamweekend and bought the FreedomFighter Edition after finishing because i liked it that much, now want to progress in Coop-Mode and support the Devs.  In short: (i can only talk about the current state of the game): interesting scenario with really nice gameplay (silence &amp; loud mixed) and gunplay - running smooth (60 FPS) on a 980M  
1597	I ran like miles from a kpa officer but he still found me....then I ran like three feet from him and hid in the dumpster. He and three other officers proceeded to drain their ammo into the trash can while looking at me DEAD in the eye. But then they left...10/10
1598	It's a good game! I'm surprised. It's reminds me 'dying light', but homefront has a better graphics, better weapons, better enemys, better cutscenes and so on. I just dont know why the rating is so low. I think this game must have 80+ if not 90+.
1599	It's an OK game. Could be better. The dialogues don't feel genuine enough. All in all it's like a microwave meal, pretty alright but nothing special. 6/10
1600	Better then reviews give it credit for. Well worth the money especially at the sale price. Combat is good, friendly AI is iffy, graphics are decent, large open world, always something to do. Would have liked to have seen a skill tree and leveling but it all works well as is. Word of caution, you will need a decent GPU to get steady performance due to bad optimization. My 780Ti worked perfect with everything maxed 1080p, but others results have varied. Overall 8/10
1601	If you like Far Cry style games, where you are in an open area and have to take over outposts, you will probably like this game. With the gun play and gadgets in the game, this was where the main fun was for me in this game. However, I found the set plays in this game annoying due to bad AI and glitches. I have seen people sitting in cars that don't exist, for example. I have had missions that dont go correctly because the trigger for the next part of the mission doesn't work. Due to these glitches, I would only recommend to buy this game on sale.
1602	i just learn about how to be a freedom country, its start from bottom, make an chaos situation, then boom , REVOLUTION !!!!!!
1603	Many wrote a negative review of this game, and i'm sure that's because of how bad the optimization was when the game came out. Now in late June 2016 the game runs smooth and without problems (Atleast on my hardware which is i7 4790K, 16 GB ram, GTX 970) But i experienced a lot of glitches that i wish was fixed. The lighting in the game is fantastic, and forget everything about maxing the game out, unless you own a GTX 1070 or better. Sound is good aswell, but some sound effects are misplaced (Such as 10 people in the street but you hear a giant crowd) I like the gameplay aswell, but the story wasn't that interesting i think. It started out great, but mid and late game wasn't that great. I never felt a connection to the characters, and there are only few important throughout the game. Many face models were reused in the city which is also a shame. A nice thing is the weapon customization. You can pick between 16 different weapons and add attachments you want in a nice Crysis style. There's also RC Car, Proximity and Remote bombs. Multiplayer has potential to be fun, but is already kinda dead, and there's currently no PVP. A more hardcore open world shooter is possible by choosing Hard difficulty. You die fast and can't craft health kits. My final score for the game would be 6/10 which is of course decent. Not recommended at full price, and don't expect to be blown away by the story. Below is 3 videos of some Story gameplay (Minor spoilers), Multiplayer gameplay and all weapons shown.   https://youtu.be/Ewu1E3g6gEY    https://youtu.be/WoMr9CQU-1k    https://youtu.be/Z0B5K3Qsynw 
1604	Runs perfectly fine and is pretty fun. Wouldn't pay full price but worth it for $12 that it was during Christmas Sale.
1605	This game really could have been great if maybe there had been more playtesting and tweaking of the controls? Riding a motorcycle is pointless as it's impossible to control. I also feel like my gun fire is all over the place. I also DESPISE checkpoint games. Why can't we just go back to the old Quicksave world where you get to keep every inch of progress you earn in a game? Grrrr. Still - the game is gorgeous and framerates high and smooth.... I'll keep playing it but I would change a few things about it if I could.
1606	This game is fun, but with all the issues it is not worth your time. Thankfully I didn't pay much for this game. Buying any game you should not have to deal with frame rate issues, game crashing and much more.
1607	With all of the negative press and steam reviews, I picked up this game after a lot of hesitation. I kept waiting to find some gamebreaking bug or for the story to suck, but I was pleasantly surprised. I really enjoyed this game, and I actually thought the story was great. It definitely isn't perfect, but it's a hell of a lot better than some of the reviews would have you believe.  If you are an ultra-PC SJW, this game will probably trigger you. But if you want to take on the role of an American insurgent, fighting against foreign occupants, and go full-on 'Murica mode, then you need to play Homefront: The Revolution.
1608	This game isn't perfect, but it is good. It feels a lot like an open world game similar to FarCry 3 and 4 only set in an urban wasteland like the denser parts of Fallout 3 and 4. All in all it's a decent game that is massively underrated in its current patched form.
1609	This game sat on my wishlist for a while. I had always wanted to try out the series, but I wasn't willing to pay full price. During the fall sale, I picked it up for about $13, which I think is a super fair price for this game. After playing it, I can safely say that it was worth that price. I still don't think I'd ever pay full price for it, but it's really not a bad game. The mechanics, like others have said, are a lot like Crysis, which makes sense since it was built in Cryengine. Add in the parkour elements and stealth action of Dying Light, and you generally have the mechanics of this game. The graphics are pretty good, and I find the gunplay fairly great as well. My only complaint is that the game can get stale quickly once you figure out you repeat the same things over and over. Overall, I enjoyed it.
1610	  Far Cry: North Korean Warfare
1611	Listen, I'm gonna be honest with you guys, this game ain't crap. Here's what some people have said and here's what I think about it.  'This game's too repetitive.'  Shooter's are repetitive, numbnuts. You point and shoot things, that's COD, Arma, Battlefield, Goldeneye, it's all of them. You should probably stop playing shooters.  Yeah, a lot of the open world side quests might seem cut and paste, and some of them are but to me that's okay. Each time you clear a stronghold or clear a strikepoint you gain part of the map, but it's enticing to see the map turn from red to blue. And at that, most of the strikepoints are different, and you can decide to take different approaches to each of these objectives. And the impression I got from other reviews was that I was going to have to incite rebellion in like 20 districts and it's this long and grindy process and the devs did this just for an 'open world' concept. That's nonsense, you do that 3 times, it's not that hard to, and I had a â¥â¥â¥â¥ ton of fun doing it.  As a matter of fact guys, stealth does infact work. Stop sucking at the game, please.  On another note, it's more andmore challenging as the game goes on to find the routes you need to take to get to the places you need to get to complete the objectives. And in a way it brings an adventure aspect tot he game, and some of the routes can get tricky with different things you need to set off to make a path connecting buildings or whatever. So I guess people don't like thinking either. It get's too repetitive I guess.  'The story sucks.'  I mean, these guys didn't write Star Wars or anything. Yeah, North Korea's not ever going to be in a position to exhibit this much control, nor have they ever been interested in 'humanitarian' efforts. But the story they set up creates an immersive and interesting environment to explore and fight in. And at that, you actually feel like you're fighting a superior military force. And still, the story is designed to question whether or not you should like the characters, and while sometimes it plays on cliches it's still original.  'It's not really open world.'  Really? What's all this freeroaming I'm doing? There's like 4 or 5 sections that are almost a kilometer across that you freeroam in. You don't know what you're talking about.  And yeah, you can't go back and freeroam after you beat the story. You couldn't in Super Mario Bros either to unlock the rest of the levels. Guess that's a â¥â¥â¥â¥ game too.    Whelp, I had fun beating this game for the first time. I'm gonna do it again, because I happen to like trying to find ways to survive when you're outnumbered and outgunned and that is the point. Death can be a bit problematic in this game. Almost done cracking a stronghold? Got like 90 valuables in your pack you're gonna sell? Progress wiped, start again. Cover is important, because AI is lethal, and that's another thing.  'The AI sucks.'  AI sucks in every game. It sucked in Smash Melee, it sucked in Soul Calibur, it sucked in COD, it sucked in every strategy game ever, and it's always going to suck.  To be honest, I thought the AI in this game was a bit better. There were only two instances of me finding AI spawning on top of me and one was because I shot ym rifle in a safe zone and the other was cuz I was storming a stronghold and apparently there was a spawn point there. As for actual movement and play of the AI, they do lethal damage and aren't to be underestimated. And when they have numbers, they will flank you, which is the smart thing to do. But you can trick large groups into trying to approach you up a staircase and you can just gun em down easy, but there's ways to gimp AI in every game, you just have to learn how and decide what you're gonna do with this knowledge. Does the AI suck? No, it's AI, and it works like it's supposed to. And again, don't underestimate them. You will die.    Do me a favor, y'all stop bein â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥es, k? K thx.  This game was pretty good, and as far as mechanics and environments go this is pretty much everything I wanted in a shooter. There's a lot of ways to take on the enemy, stealth, bring a gun, bring some resistance friends, bring a bike, throw some bombs, snipe em down, whatever. Urban environments are always fun, especially for me.  And uh, one last thing. Those myths of frame glitches or whatever the hip new kids are calling it these days, they exist in this game. Now, two solutions. 1) Get a better system to run this on. 2) Turn the graphics down. I had a good amount of frame hiccups, and I have to imagine that it was super buggy on release for people to say what they did about the game. I still like the game though; it's unique in its ability to let me decide how I'm gonna shoot up my neighbor's house.  But still, 11/10, would nuke my son and kill Boston (try the damn game).
1612	In my opinion this game is 7/10 maybe even 8 after they have patched the game completely.(not finished the game) Cons: -Some fps drops -Too much same missions -some bugs here and there Pros: -long story -good gun play -many ways to finish missions -immersive openworld I would recommend this game to people that like farcry, Metro, Crysis and dying light.
1613	Anyone that does not like this game is a dork! All the negative reviews are wrong. This game is amazing. It's as good or better then any other top rated FPS. There may have been problems at the start, but after patching any issues went away. Performance is not an issue. I couldn't stop playing and even after finishing the story I went right back in to play again. There are so many side missions that you can play again and again. So don't be afraid of the negative reviews. Get this game. You won't be sorry!
1614	So, it's Farcry's gameplay with a Homefront skin on it, with the racism turned way down. I really enjoy Farcry's gameplay, and this game is budget priced, with interesting weapons and enemies and it doesn't overstay its welcome. The text logs are thoughtful and the voices don't get too repetitive and the themed maps are interesting. It's not going to light the world on fire but it all works pretty well.  There's some kind of online mode or something. For me, the campaign was worth the price of admission, and I haven't tried online, so whatever.  Buy it if you like Farcry.   A final note: This isn't the Blood Dragon sequel that we deserve, but I'm not going to hold that against it. I'm for sure going to blame someone somewhere though, you can bet on that.
1615	User dood1234 couldnt have said it any better. I just finished the game and I feel the same now about it as I did when I first started playing. Here is his review and its spot on.  'I have never written a reivew before because I generally feel like the community or the critics get it right. This game is a different case. This game is so underrated it hurts. I cannot speak for how it played at launch but I can speak to how it plays now. It honestly does something other games dont't, and thats give me a ton of tools but at the same time make me feel like an underdog. In my opinion the shooting is very crisp and strategic. Also the weapon modding is awesome making one gun so much more versitile. Also the story seems decent with a very good setting to boot. The graphics are good but demanding. Because of this if you don't have current hardware you should wait to buy this. so far I am only a few hours in but this feels like a more focused and difficult far cry game. Because of the launch issues this game experienced I think it's reputation got ruined. This is definetly one of those games that needs to be given a second chance because it's to much dang fun not to.' -dood1234
1616	So I played this game for a few hours on and off for a few weeks. I was not really a fan of the first one but I really like the concept that the homefront story line has to offer. When I first started playing the bugs and the system slowdowns really, really, really killed the game for me and stopped playing it (got to the game breaking bug were I met some random dude before the armory got raided). On a whim I decided to pick it up again after fallout 4 and because of the patching the game is FAR BETTER and actually worth playing.  The game is not the game I wanted Homefront TR to be but it is ok and a good way to kill a few hours. By far my biggest issues with this game is two fold...  1. The lack of weapons, in the first Homefront there were tons of different weapons from several types of HMG, MMG, SMGs, pistols, AR/AK variants, ect. In this game there are maybe about 12'ish weapons that are diverse but you get the one or two that work with your play style and generally keep them. With the last homefront you felt that need to pick up a new weapon every few mins because you felt the need to try this M4 with the EO Tech, oh look a AK with a CCO, OMG a Shotgun with a ACOG!!!!!!  2. This game suffers from the Farcry outpost capturing bug. Once you clear a sector it is sort of rinse and repeat, there are sectors that are more fun to libreate such as the one where the KNA supporters live but once again there is little variety.   TLDR: Good game (NOW), pick it up on sale, waste a few hours that god has given us and move on with your life. Wish they used the weapon variety that the old homefront had.  
1617	I really enjoyed playing homefront the revolution, it kinda reminded me of a nice mix between madmax and the division. with a nice story line.   only negative thing is the bugs in the game, every now you see enemy's bug out, and here and there some objectives seem bugged, but if you are really resourcefull you can even overcome these :)  Enjoyed this game and was worth my time and money.
1618	Here are just some ideas i thought about the game while playing. its the first review i've written so many words! 1. i bought this game on winter sale so the price doesnt matter so much to me. 2. the game run well on my pc but abit laggy on co-op mode. 3. the game itself could be quite repetitive as in looting bins, dead bodies and taking down enemy towers but the atmosphere was so well done. i died several times cuz it was very easy for soldiers to find and kill me but it felt very realistic. taking down the facilities on normal mode was extrmely hard but there is a sense of achievment, like, sky high. 4. looting is something i do so that i could sell it for money but whats the difference between, for e.g., 'canned food' and 'children's toy'? is something worth more than others? 5. the lighting on characters was dark on darker characters....i have to turn on the torch to see their face clearly.,, and with the torch on, moving makes me feel dizzy. 6.resistance mode/ co-op is separate from story mode and the missions are quite challenging on normal mode. 7. the anime for customising guns look so so cool, but the options are still limited to 3 custimisations for each gun. 8. the RC cars made me think of Watchdogs 2, but in this case they expode!
1619	 This game is pretty sick
1620	This game is very good, the campaign is long, the environment is fairly big, and the mechanics of this game is unique seeing it has a mix of Farcry freeroam yet not so open as such. However, they should continue to expand on that, and with the newest DLC that has just been released, im sad to say they fell very short. As it doesnt even add 20 minutes of gameplay at most. Hell. It could have been part of the main game to begin with, as it isnt DLC worthy.  Yes this is a company that has been able to stand up to Ubisoft and go 'â¥â¥â¥â¥ you'. But with the latest DLC as an example. They arent going to get much further unless they step their game up. If they continue to go down the path of what was shown in the latest DLC. They wont be in business for much longer, because they will just end up becoming just like Ubisoft. Come on Developers, don't make the game look good so you can steal peoples money. Thats how you lose your business. Make the game entertaining, more specifically make DLC's that further enchances the reputation and the dynamics of the main game, expand it further. So that more people want to play it, and because its good quality, more people will soon get it, and that will earn you more consumers, where as just making it look good and coming out with a DLC that barely adds anything just to steal peoples money will only come back to haunt you, and in this industry, those consequences are to the fullest.  Would I recommend this game. Yes. But, that is only for the main game content. Would I still recommend this game if they continue to come out with let down DLC's to grab peoples money. No. So step up your game devs, You are one of the few if not the only company to say 'â¥â¥â¥â¥ you Ubisoft' and still be in business. Don't throw all that away.
1621	Games is pretty fun, but as of right now it is worthless. I wan't to say im about 40-50% through the game and I am glitched to where I can't even progress to the next part of the mission. That's a big definite fail in book. Until this game is fixed, which I doubt it, I would pass and wait for a sale, but be forwarned of this glitch.  The gameplay is ok and the story kind bores me. Just seems so random that both enemy and friendly coexist within the same blcok. It's like the DMZ, but in the US. Takes the realism away for me. Weapon modifications are different , but more fantasy. Voice acting is bad as well. I kind feel like I was starting to dreage through game at this point, but I would have at least liked to get my moneys worth before it crapped out.
1622	  30 MIN OF PLAY TIME REALLY!!!!! Don't bother buying the Voice of Freedom DLC 5.99 is not worth it if you have to buy it. The main game is a blast though.
1623	i'm playing the game and i feel the the game is not polish or finish. the gunns are to big and they look like balloons the story of occupation of the usa is a joke still for a fantasy story and i feel that the game will crash when the game freeze up. don't get me wrong i like the guerrilla warfare and the gamplay and i wish the map was bigger. no disrespect to anyone but i got this feeling that if this game was made by top the developers it was going to be a unique and awesome game. o and you don't get to free roam after you finish the game
1624	Good plot, thats about it. the game is bascially a lag simultor it is really hard to shoot enemy's and they basically get hit once run away and then bring the army.  4/10 would not bang again
1625	First off, wow, a great idea killed by the Devs. I mean the promise of everything that was not included in the First, but nope lied to again.   This is a single player game unless you have two to four friends who also bought it, as there is no Multiplayer/resistance mode. As stated by so many the graphics are dated, weird mouse lag, cursor bug, smart phone great idea but the texts on the ims are hard to read.  If you take an area don't worry the KPA will not try to take it back nor will they venture there unless its for a strike mission or you are spotted by a large â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ ship with a red light that can be dodged quickly.  I really wanted to love this game, but for the cost of the game not including if you bought the season pass, this game is not worth 20 bucks. Oh and as for custimization nope other then putting acceries onto your weapons thats it. But you can make your charector in the non existant MP.  Open world is a lie!!!!! Open world like Fallout series to be able to go anywhere and do what you want to do, well you can in this game but that means in a couple of city blocks. Not only that but the game does not feel like its in Philly. It does not feel like in any American city.  Pros: The idea of the game Cons: Everything about this game Frame Rates on High end machines are the same for E machines Graphics dated and muted (not in a good way) Lag in single player Lack of making your Person unique Poor AI on both sides allies are stupid and stand out in middle of the street (no way to give orders to them either) KPA will walk into ambushes, they have a vehicle that will sit and allow you to throw grenades at it. Molitove Cocktails that do not damage vehicles but only Infantry. Apparently they never read why Moltoves were used and where they were successful i.e. against tanks and armor, vehicles, not that great on Infantry as people move away from a flaming bottle.  So if you buy this game due so when its on sale for 10 bucks and you and some friends can play together for an hour or so, or on a drinking night.
1626	DO NOT BUY IT! Its anwful, very limited story, multiplayer have few missions, linear quests inside, few weapons and the AI is dumb, like very, all u have to do is bunker up in any bulding with stairs and wait and shoot. 'Open world' big lie, solo is kinda that, somehow similar to farcry primal, u have the main missions, u can kill AI around the maps, side missions and thats it... Oh, beside the fact that multiplayer sucks, also its quiet hard to find a room with all 4 players, usually u have to go solo or with 2 players due to bad matchmaking.  If u MUST buy this game, check youtube gameplay and foruns, this is a BETA game
1627	This game is an insult to Homefront. I tried not to listen to the talk about it being bad, but 6 hours in, I find myself whining outloud to myself as I play 'uugggh It's sooo â¥â¥â¥â¥ing buggyy!!!!' Example... There's a part where you need to run to defend an area, and your rebel fighters are running down a corridor with you, at the end of a corridor is an open door to the next area. You can't run through the door because it's a loading point where you need to press E to load the next zone, but the NPCs are running through the door, pushing you out of the way so you can't get into the half-inch wide area to press E and you're stuck getting hipchecked over and over until eventually you button mash your way into the loading screen.  On top of that, the mission structure is weird, it's like they thought 'What are some popular games?' and tried to mix farcry with assassin's creed for the 'open world' gameplay, the instructions are often unclear (to me at least) and I don't even know why I need 3 different currencies for things... It's just one of those games where some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ corporate â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ tells developers they need to have this popular feature and that feature and have it done by yesterday, I'm sure...  The story's still... ok I guess. I mean I still wanna finish the game but I think it's only because I don't want to waste the time I've put in.
1628	Can't play it, Can't return it. Took a chance since the game came out in May, maybe they fixed everything. Nope, everytime i run there's constantly lag. I am running i5 4690k and 1070 FTW
1629	Waste of money. - Story is boring and the gameplay is dull and repetitive. - Graphics are great, gun sounds are wonderful and the melee takedowns are nice. - Voice acting is half decent but (and this may sound weird) the animations during 'cutscenes' are overdone and cringey. - Since the cutscenes happen real time, if you stand in the wrong spot the NPCs will just collide with you and slide you out of the way.  - Citizens and Friendly soldiers can sometimes trap you into corners and you either have to wait for them to move or fast travel away. Really annoying. - Apparently everyone in the future will have a **** ton of facial piercings?  If you get it, get it cheap.

1633	Like Farcry but bad. Seriously, if you like repetitive open world FPS games, Farcry games are a far superior choice. This game has:    Bad AI.    Bad spawns, did you just kill that KPA soldier bashing a civ? Oh well, he'll respawn in a few seconds.    Poor level design.    Crap story, none of the characters are interesting.    Lots and I mean, LOTS of bugs.   Just don't do it, don't buy this rubbish, I got it on a big sale and I still think I overpaid.
1634	This game is an insult to Homefront.

1635	  30 minutes into the game and I can't play it anymore the audio of the gunshots are completely off you have to wait like 10 seconds to hear them and the game freezes every other minute this game is below pre-alpha and should never have been released a like this. If they fix the game and it has great potential but otherwise stay away from it.  Graphics : 8/10 play ability : 2/10
1636	This game has one big problem: It feels mediocre in many ways.   There is nothing particulary bad about it, sure there are some bugs, mostly visual, sure the AI has some hiccups here and there and sure the story isn't super engaging but none of that makes the game bad, none of it really disturbes the flow of gameplay all that much.   Yet the game doesn't really have anything great about it, nothing you are going to remember 2 years from now, no amazing stories to tell your buddies and thats what makes this game... well mediocre.    Still it's worth a buy and thus i'm giving it a thumbs up. Surely not at full price but if you see this in a sale and want to have an entertaining open world FPS that borrows heavily from the Far Cry series then Homefront is certainly worth picking up.
1637	Diceroll: 2/6 Remember Rome 2? Or perhaps Act of Aggression? How they went for 'Remastered?' This game needs it. Overlooking the bugs, the performance sinks, the blindly stupid AI, the mediocre graphics, the disappointing 'Mission' based Co-op and a somewhat bland SP experience and the clunky/unresponsive parkour... I'd be very much inclined to say 'It's worth it... If its price was 20â¬'  As the game kept me in just over refund time, I pray the devs will accept my money and spend it on improving this game... Because right now it is a shameful display. Really. It needs a 'remastered' -very- badly. Please convince me that I did not make a bad investment.  But! Do not dismiss this game out of hand. Come back in a half-year's time. If it is given -a lot- of loving care, it can still be saved.
1638	The game died so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing fast
1639	Definitely not worth 59.99. Pretty buggy for me, got stuck on a main mission that must have glitched out and now my story line cant even progress because of one little bug.....tried going back to recent checkpoints but that did nothing. I will admit though, sneaking around philly and taking out KPA and looting is pretty fun.
1640	Ever want to hear your self say the following:  -Who just killed me and how?!  -I'm getting stuck here, how?!  -I just cleared that place less than three minutes ago, how are they back?!  -Get out of the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing way ally npcs!   Well then this is the game for YOU! Pick it up NOW!   First map (not the intromap), i finally decided to bumrush every capture point. Hey, it worked! Second map, finally (!) some sneaking and hit 'n' run attacks. Enemies spawning out of nowhere right next to you and shotgun you in the face, it will happen. Enemies that pop in and out of the map when you are sniping down the road, it will happen.
1641	It's not challenging. It's too easy. The mini map is too large. Agree with others that the AI is poor. And there's no story really.
1642	I have always loved movies like Red Dawn and games like World in Conflict and Freedom Fighter that use an invaded/occupied USA as a narrative backdrop. Homefront was decent enough for me to play all the way through a few times and dive into the multiplayer for a bit. I say all of this to emphasize how much I really wanted this game to be good.  It just wasn't. I would only recommend buying this game for more than $20 when it goes on sale some time in the future.  1) Technical Flaws: While some of these may be fixed in the future this game has serious technical flaws. More than any other game I've bought and played on through steam. This includes even alpha games. There were serious graphical errors and huge immersion breaking flaws in the AI and certain scripted events.  2) A flawed implementation of a Far Cry 3 Rip off: Numerous aspects of core-gameplay will be instantly recognizable as a direct rip off of Far Cry 3's approach to open world FPS. Even the loot of bodies looks and functions in the same way. That in itself isn't a bad thing; I love FC3's style and Ubi's trying to milk that for all its worth with FC4 and FCprimal. But the implementation of this style in this game could have been amazing but it just didn't quite cut it. The city sections were far more limited in scope and it didn't feel so much like an open world as a series of very repetitive events. FC3 can get bland after liberating your umpteenth radio tower but this game somehow made it even worse.  3) Horrible Weapons System: It might sound cool to have one weapon that can switch on the fly into other weapons but in practice I found this was severely limiting and underwhelming. Within a short time I had unlocked every weapon in the game and none of them were thrilling to use. This might seem nitpicky, but in an FPS your weapons are a huge part part of your experience and I didn't like how it was implemented at all. It was novel, but it wasn't good.
1643	Was and avid player of the first homefront, unfortunately this game does not live up to the hype that was created for it, and did not reach the potential of the story that its predecessor gave. I would not recommend this game to anyone who is looking for an open world game as it is marketed it to.
1644	Its not that its buggy, but in fact its the gameplay itself.  - You are hunted like it feels 24/7 but you cant hide unless you go in a trashcan. - The combat is horrid, your AI team doesnt do anything for you and you have to kill them all.. In 5~ shots you are dead and there is about 10 at a time to take out. - Its trying to be realistic but in reality its not at all - It feels like a wanna be dying light before the zombies came into play  Problems I have:   - The optimization, I run a 750 ti and get a MAX of 45 fps ingame.  - Again.. It tries very hard to be realistic but cant be
1645	Music 3/5 Combat 2/5 Graphics/Visuals 3/5 Overall Gameplay 2/5 Animations 3/5 Sound Effects 2/5 Controls 1/5 Stability 4/5 Story 2/5 Multiplayer (not rated; didn't experience) UI 1/5  Comments: Worst controls, UI and mission direction of any game i've played in a long time.  half the time you don't even know what you're supposed to be doing because the game just keeps throwing timed mission objectives at you before you can even complete one of them and then you just auto fail the rest because they expire before you can even start them.  then the vehicle controls (specifically the bike) are worse than the pc controls on the original pc port of dark souls  the ui tries to be cute by trying to make it more immersive, but what they actually ended up doing was just turning the UI into a bloated, convoluted, complicated mess.
1646	Wait for new patch 
1647	Bought it for Guerilla Warfare, Insted I got a the opposite with face to face combat...  That and This game is unoriginal and consists of caputing points, The Ai is crappy coded and the aiming just sucks....  I preorderd this game off â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, If I had got it off steam I would of asked for a refund as this sucks really Badly.
1648	This is like those B-rated action movies that use recycled plots and use B-rated, forgotten actors to play in it.  As they say, 'good ideas, poor execution.'

1652	So far this game is horrible. It's not so much the plot or the AI or that, it's that the movement is HORRIBLE; the framerate sucks, and I'm @ patch 1.5 right now. I've played w/ the video detail and the mouse sensitivity, but the movement is lose; it's terrbile. It's like moving underwater.. which you can't have in a fire fight. A good FPS has sharp, crisp movements (ie COD or BF4). This is just... well.. bleh..   Do NOT buy this game. There is no amount of patching that's going to fix the CryEngine.
1653	First I Have a 980 Ti and a G-sync monitor. The game itself is fun, if you liked farcry 3 and 4 and I like that style however many dont. Instead of one sprawling world it's split into smaller zones that seems to work. However it really fails in the performance side, not only does it struggle to maintain 60 FPS it struggles to maintain ANY FPS. As in, in 5 min of gameplay I can get anywhere between 78-22 FPS it becomes completely unplayable when it is dropping to 20-30 FPS and theres no apparent reason it does it, and it happens for 5 min at a time. So to sum up if you like the farcry style this game might be for you, however dont buy it till theres a few major patches it needs to be cooked for a little longer. 
1654	5/10 rinse and repeat shallow storyline, main character is like a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sheep...way too linear..
1655	I played through the campaign, finished it and deleted the game. Not likely I will ever play it again. It plays like COD (but worse). The game is glitchy, NPCs sitting mid-air, within chairs (I mean, as in being part of the chair) or fighting non-existing enemies inside a safe house or just blocking a doorway so you can't go through to finish your mission. I had to reload the last checkpoint a few times because the game just stalled and NPC just went into a neverending loop of nothingness. Not happy with that one.
1656	 First off,the people who give this game a positive review are the people trying to console themselves because they know they've just wasted 60$.Get over it guys.   After giving this game a solid 8 hours and progressing half way throught the story,i must say this is one of the worst games i have ever played in my life.This is a disgrace for a FPS game.   Blatant storyline and gameplay,Wack â¥â¥â¥ NPC's, Crappy shadows all over the game,Frame drops then and there and the list goes on.  Oh and the most disastrous thing in this game is the aiming and shooting mechanism,if i aim an enemy and shoot,i would be shooting at the enemy but the enemy wont be shot.In simple words if i aim and fire a rocket launcher at an enemy vehicle,the rocket launcher simply wont strike the vehicle.Thats how awful it is. .  Although the game is only 17$ for me on the INDIAN store,For others this game is not worth 60$.i would skip this game infact. Over this i dont know why they implemented denuvo over this piece of crap.This wont be played even if its pirated.The developers plainly copied farcry's mechanics and parts of dying light's BGM and gameplay.Nothing really good to say about this game except the Weapon customization,which they messed up because it takes a long damn time to customize a weapon and by the time you customize it , the enemy would kill you.   Overall the game is appaling.Please dont buy this. 
1657	It's not as bad as everyone is saying it is. Don't pay 60 bucks for it though, that it isnt worth it. Wait for a sale or get it through some other site.
1658	I enjoyed the game ! but the thing is there were like 30 bugs and glitches in the game and i can't even complete the campaign because of one of the glitches. &gt;:( Now i have to watch the ending on youtube! I DON'T RECOMMEND
1659	Save your money for better games like Watch dogs 2, Ghostrecon wildland, Mass effect Andromeda this year. It is absolutely not what the trailer showed. Terrible AI, bad optimization, nothing interesting to make you have an over 1 hours' gameplay.
1660	I don't know what's a bigger mess, this game or my life
1661	It's Not Always Sunny In Philadelphia.  Homefront: The Revolution screams lack of polish. The main character moves so slow and clunky, you ride a dirt bike straight through enemies like they are holograms because they don't react after getting hit, AI and NPC get stucked in various objects or just looping around corners, pathfinding for AI in general is absolute bonker. There's no such thing as scavenging in a 'hard time' because loots are plentiful especially when you get ammo upgrade, but for some reasons, of all things you can craft, the most important piece of consumable - which is healing kit, isn't one of them?  The game has some of the strangest designs I've ever seen in an FPS title. Just like standard open world shooter formula, you can go loud or you can stealth, but it seems like the game just can't decide which aspect to flesh out more instead of balancing them out. You can buy a silencer but you can't slap on anything aside from a pistol, the other silenced weapon is the pneumatic pistol which has abysmal damage drop off. You can buy some upgrades to help stealth more reliable like camouflage or silent footstep, but... why do we need these when there's no upgrade to increase the number of equipments, you know, the things that help us much more in and outside combat? The guns handle well, the customize system is neat, but some are definitely better than others, why would you switch to standard AR while you already have LMG already? Why would you use the marksman rifle when the battle rifle only need 1 more bullet to kill an enemy while it has more ammo?  The activities are boring. You can destroy machineries, turn on propaganda radios, help random civilians like slitting a KPA soldier's throat, destroy their APC, giving beggars $10... for the 'big' ones like transceivers reveal points of interest or safe house that brings Resistance soldiers to overwatch, the way you capture them are the same: Kill all KPA soldiers and interact with a radio. You might say capturing outposts in Far Cry games are the same, but here's one thing: outposts in Far Cry have more variety. In Homefront: The Revolution, when you capture these locations, you don't need to care about alarm (because if you get into a house then the enemies won't be able attack you), you don't need to scout the location (because they are not big enough to worth giving a damn about patrol's pattern), you can't do creative things like wingsuit into a compound or use a vehicle to ramp straight into it, instead you have to find entraces that are already placed around the compound by the dev. Even the factories in red zone have the same layout and the same number of enemies, unique locations are few and far between making it a chore to capture them all.  The open world feels so contrived and limited, different sections are connected through tunnels and are divided into red and yellow zones. Red zones contain exclusively ruins, bombarded cities which left only ruins after ruins after ruins, and it doesn't make any â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sense why KPA still has heavy patrol out there. It looks fine in the first hours, but then I quickly grew tired of repetitive destroyed streets and buildings. Lombard, a section which was previously nuked by the KPA and has turned into a S.T.A.L.K.E.R wonderland has the same treatment, and KPA even bothered to put rare weaponry into it.  Yellow zones are more civilized, you can hide behind civilians to avoid detection but that isn't effective all the time. When the KPA is alarmed, thanks to horrible AI design, you can cheese out enemies by running around dark corners and find a dumbster to hide. If you get caught, just run away, the KPA isn't more aggressive the more you create destruction, their reinforcement is just some soldiers, sometimes heavy soldier, a Wolverine and heavy armored tank. If your objective is capturing a section on the map then don't worry, activate the radio and alarm will be clear immediately.  Story is probably the worst offender of Homefront: The Revolution. You know some movies or B-games that you can watch or play them drunk and still have a giggle out of them? Homefront is not one of them. It takes itself so serious with the 'REVOLUTION!!!!' theme that constantly shout into your ears until you put on your uncle Sam shirt and eat 2 hamburgers at the same time. There's a guy on the radio who keep saying good job to me when I stab a KPA soldier in the face or destroy random machine which make me want to reach through the radio and slap him until he call his mother's name. The story revolves around a silent protagonist who has PhD in errand jobs, a leader who talks obvious things, a tough-â¥â¥â¥ woman who can't just shut up for 2 seconds about killing every KPA soldier and their kids, a doctor who speaks low Samuel L. Jackson's accent and kinda be there to balance out the acts of violence with peace. The story is about saving some guy you can't give a â¥â¥â¥â¥ about but apparently he's the ultimate terrorist so all we need is to get his â¥â¥â¥ out of the prison despite we only seeing him for like 3 or 4 times throughout the game, hell even who the main villian is isn't confirmed until 2/3 of the game. The theme of Homefront: The Revotion turns from guerrila warfare and oppressing the brutality, yet we don't interact with any civilian, we only create destruction for 'the greater good', you ARE THE TERRORIST, and the revolution is lead by a bunch of childish kids with access to guns.  Deep inside, I know there's a great foundation in Homefront: The Revolution. The gunplay is decent, graphics are top-notch, the atmosphere oozes style, yet its gameplay design is outdated for 2016 standard. It's probably the closest thing to a Far Cry clone with interesting world design, but as a whole package, Homefront: The Revolution is simply forgettable. It's not a revolution worth fighting for.
1662	Please read if you want to know basics  For starters i would just like to point out that i have 36 min in this game. When i started playing i put an alarm on my phone for the next 1:30 min to make sure i still had the chance to refund which is 2hrs btw and 12 days (so if you want to refund do it while you can). The first problem i came across was the performance. The game was very jittery throughout. I played the game on low and still had issues. My pc specs is a gtx 760, 16gb ddr4 and a 5820k (bottleneck much) but my setup is for self-explanitory reasons. I was very impatient to get into the fighting and when i did, i felt like garbage. The overall movement such as mantling and aiming feels unfinished. Aiming is just dreadful and this was just the beginning of the game. The start of the game feels slow but gets increasingly better. The concepts and ideas are very innovative but it is ruined by the story and what you must accomplish. Gameplay is repetitive and i got bored and frustrated just so early into the game.  The first homefront was a thrilling game with a very action-pact feel. In Homefront TR, i dont agree with the open world and would rather keep it as a point-to-point style gameplay still having freedom to explore. But since we cant change anything heres the verdict:  I could see this game enjoyable but frankly no original multiplayer where you fight team vs team and poor optimization, if i was to play this game without spending almost $60, i would find myself discovering better titles that i would rather spend my time playing and not beat myself with the appalling gameflow. AND LEAVE THIS GAME TO THE NON-EXISTENT   KAOS STUDIOS and THQ
1663	I Keep Seeing Reviews that say 'This is so Bad' or 'Worst game I've ever Played' So, in response to this, I think its time I Shed some light on how I feel about this Game.  So, First off, Is it good? Well, it kinda depends if you dont really care about the story or stuff like that. It is Fun... But if you're looking for something like Destiny or Halo, you're in the wrong place my friend. The Story starts out great at first, but it fades off around mid-game. The gameplay itself is fun, its what you'd expect from any fps. The aiming is a little clunky, and the AI is somewhat stupid, but its enjoyable. Before patch 1.5, it was broken, not horribly, but it was broken. The only real downside now is how bad its optimizations are, but I'll cover why its like this soon.  Secondly, the Multiplayer: It's Okay, there is no PvP (Sorry all of You Cod and Halo Fans, but this isn't for you!) This is a Bluntly stated PvE Experience. This doesn't mean its bad, the missions are enjoyable. There's Just a Lack of Multiplayer maps, But Dambuster studios said that they'd Make More maps for FREE (Everyones Favorite Word!)  Thirdly, My opinion as to why this game was bad at first: This is most likely on combination of 2 reasons,  ONE: This was rushed by the publishers, the Devs were probably going to take more time with this, but the publishers probably said, 'This needs to go out now, or we wont release it.'  TWO: Inexperince with Making a Game like this. If you never knew what Dambuster Studios was before this, well... You're not alone. This Is Dambuster's FIRST GAME. If you were in their shoes, and It was your first time making a game like this, It's obvious that you're going to have problems with your game, This Is also most likely why this game is badly optimized,they dont Quite Know what to do yet. Dambuster studios have made a great first impression with this game however, they obviously have some raw talent. This game was, and still is, Glitchy and Buggy, but Again, It's their FIRST TIME Doing something like this.(Give 'Em Some credit at least!)  IN CONCLUSION/ TL;DR: This game is Wonky, but it's clearly not as bad as people say it is, its a solid 7/10, its release price was kinda High, but if you can find it on sale, Go for it.   EDIT: Good lord, some people are really going out of their way to make this game look worse than it really is...and you know whats funny? This is near IDENTICAL to what happened to the original homefront on it's release: the game came out, everyone thought it sucked, a small group of players kept playing it, and a year or two later: everyone respects homefront as a good game. Watch, in the next year or so, everyone is gonna play this game and they'll like it, and everyone who joined the hate bandwagon will realize that they screwed up.  EDIT 2: Update 2.0 came out and god DAMN. That Just turned the dial up to 11! It runs WAY better, It looks like my prediction was correct...For now.
1664	Its not that the Game is bad in general, sequences/ cutscenes look pretty nice, light effects too. i like the story idea as well.     But the Game has more flaws than good aspects for me.
1665	 Ignoring the â¥â¥â¥â¥ poor story and repitition, I do like the mechanics surrounding armament and how nicely it compares to other shooters from the early 2000s.   That being said, it's 2016, and maybe I was spoiled with amazing games in childhood but there is no where near enough content to be priced where it is, especially if they add paid dlc.   Last point, it shouldn't be more fun to watch a trailer then play the actual game, especiallywith something in such dire need of polish and bug fixes.  4/10, 3 for creativity and the tactical sense you need, 1 for â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥y hot nose ring lady marry me plox
1666	I've had a great time with this game so far. I've seen all of the horrid reviews describing this game as terrible, but personally I can already tell this will be one of my favorite games of the year. The story is quite intriguing to me, I love the revolutionary aspect. The environments are beautiful, even though I run the game on low due to a bad computer. It runs at a solid frame rate for me as well. The gameplay is amazing, too. The guns each individual different recoil kicks and sounds make them quite distinct from eachother and gunfights feel amazing. The weapon customization is one of the best things about this game, as every gun has 2 other sub-types. For example, the battle rifle, my personal favorite weapon, comes off the shop as a DMR, but it can also be turned into a semi-auto sniper rifle and even a 'freedom launcher' rocket launcher! Every gun in the game including the basic pistol has 2 other weapon convertions available for it, adding even more variability and possibilities for strategy. In my setup, I use a shotgun with the 'incendiary launcher' conversion with a marksman rifle as my other weapon. The game will remind you a lot of Far Cry, as it is open world and has different zones with activities to do inside, like capturing outposts. Except, this game takes that Far Cry formula to the next level. The outposts to capture have variability and are fun, instead of the Far Cry outposts where I'd get bored and find them just as tedious chores to do. The world around you feels alive as while you walk around, some citizens may support you, but others may be 'Nork' sympathizers. This game is truly a diamond hidden in the rough. The only problem is the sub-par optimization. Frame drops aren't too common but they happen sometimes and it's a bit of a inconvienence but I can get past this as I enjoy the game a lot. The game is actually rather difficult, too. I played it on normal difficulty with aim assist off and I found that stealth was a requirement unless I did some hit and run. You might want to go guns blazing right off the bat but patience is the key as you really feel like you are a revolutionary due to the KPA outnumbering and outgunning you. The multiplayer is actually very fleshed out and really makes you feel as if you are a revolution. You can do some amazing things when you work together in this co-op mode. Now, for the final verdict. I reccomend buying it on sale due to those optimization errors and bad AI, but wait a while and that will be fixed (hopefully). I give the game an 8.5/10 due to stellar gameplay and story, only limited by bad AI and a below-average launch.
1667	10/10 Probably the best looking game I have ever seen.
1668	Definitely not the greatest first person shooter ever...but not the worst either.   Relatively bland (6/10) but I'd still recommend it if it's on sale!
1669	It lags randomly and stutters frequently But after the patch its plays kinda smooth now oh btw dumbass A.I  but i recommend This game since it is free now and is at a discount.
1670	  This game is caca dookie. let me start off by saying in full disclosure that I did not pay for this game i only played it on the free weekend. So what makes this game utter crap, well kinda everything. 1) the weapons in the game seem to lack any real feeling, i cant place my finger on it they just seem to all feel wrong. 2) the story, i could give a flying rats â¥â¥â¥ about my charecter or any other charecter i have met. i have zero emotional attachment to anyone one, either as a comrade or a brother in arms. it just fails on all levels of making you connect with the world or the charecters. Finally number 3) this is the big MF of why this game gets the golden turd award. First let me bring your attention to the fact that I am playing this game in {{1080}} not 4k not 1440 but {{1080}}. now let me also tell you my system specs. I have a beast of a pc with an i7 4690k (no overclock at this time, i know dont judge), 16gb ddr3 1600mhz, samsung pro 250 ssd. and the BMF of a gpu. Now the game has a huge fps problem even with my specs going from the 120 down to around 70. So what is a BMF gpu you ask? well its not the 750ti, or the 960, not the 970 or the 980 hell it's not even the titan x, nope its the top of the line 1080. So there is absolutely no F'ing reason this game should not be running at a consistant 144 with max everthing except for the fact of â¥â¥â¥â¥ poor optimization. Stay away from this game if the developer cant produce a game that runs at a decent FPS in {{{{{1080}}}}} on the top of the line card, made for gaming in 8k than someone done f'ed it up.
1671	  I would suggest Deep Silver to rename the game to one of the following titles:  'HomefrontÂ®: The MEH' 'HomefrontÂ®: Ì¶ Ì¶CÌ¶lÌ¶uÌ¶nÌ¶kÌ¶yÌ¶ Ì¶FÌ¶aÌ¶rÌ¶ Ì¶CÌ¶rÌ¶yÌ¶ Ì¶EÌ¶dÌ¶iÌ¶tÌ¶iÌ¶oÌ¶nÌ¶' 'Far Cry &amp; Crysis: Re-tarded Son'  Don't get me wrong, it looks awesome if you don't mind random crashes, weird bugs, the cluncky controls and the steps you have to follow to actually aim to something with your mouse.   Get it for $10 or $15, it has nice graphics and... nevermind, i need more vodka to finish this.
1672	More bugs than in Amazon Forest
1673	  Played the game through the free weekend deal. Positives Taking over some of the compounds with just a pistol (my own challenge) was fun.  Negatives The game took about 10 hours to beat on hard mode (poor for an open world game). There was no real reason to take over strikepoints. The phone 'stash finder' was absolutely pointless as they show on the map anyway. The weapon mods are all available straight away (I only used the LMG and Battle Rifle - no need to change it up). The story makes barely any sense (slight spoiler - why use gas???) The jobs were boring (take pictures of 20 KPA - really?) I don't feel like I achieved anything.  At least I can thank the publisher for letting me play it for nothing and save myself the anguish of paying to be disappointed.
1674	In mission Hearh and Minds is bug what deny you to progress in game. I enjoy the game a lot, but I cant progress any further, because of that gamebreaking bug. Do not buy until the bug is fixed !
1675	Great game. I admittedly didnt play it until after it was patched but the game was very stable for me. Never had a crash or anything gamebreaking. Found a couple spots where I could leave the map and then you would fall under the map and die. But you have to be looking for these and they arent common.
1676	I would Buy this game agian if i had to i will admit the game has some bugs and glitches but if u get pat that there is a good story well made game and gets patches and updates to fix it so if u have the money for this game i would say you should buy it
1677	I having fun with this game, sure the story is nothing special, there are not a lot of weapons even with the Mods but its quit fun and i looking forward to the first DLC.  
1678	  Experience: Played 4 hours into the game; started liberating the yellow zone. The game is a lot of fun in my opinion and plays like an Urban Far Cry. I would honestly pay a full retail price for the game but I won't be. The reason is due to poor optimization. I am running above the recommended specs but the game constantly hitches and stutters. Even though the game is fun, I can't have fun due to the poor optimization.
1679	Whoa, not what I expected! Thank you for the free weekend. I would have never known how good this game is without this free trial weekend. I WILL purchase this game, I suggest you do to if you like Open World FPS games with loot drops!   Open World Homefront game! Very cool!  I haven't had any stability issues playing this game. I run this game on all max settings and I get close to my max 75 frame rate.  What am I playing on? (My Computer Specs (up-to-date drivers)): -------------------------------------------- .Windows 10 .NVIDIA Geforce 980M .1080p Resolution .Intel i7 .32 GB RAM .2TB SSD Hard Drive --------------------------------------------  Buy this game!
1680	Frankly Dont know what people are complaining about. The game in its current state is good. Nothing incredibly special. played this game with no idea how gameplay was going to be and was surprised. Wasnt expecting the Far Cry Esque style open world/missions. Game ran perfectly fine for me with no hiccups on gtx970.  -graphics wise. Game looks great to me. Npcs are a little robotic and AI isnt too bad and ran smooth  -story wise. Didnt get to play much but so far the story is Okay. nothing spectacular. the gameplay is mainly where the fun is at. upcoming dlc will add more to single player.  -gameplay. Fun. Got a Far Cry vibe from playing. going around and completing missions that pop up around the map. find materials to craft useful items and moddable guns.  -mulitplayer. resistance mode actually wasnt that bad. didnt have that hard of a time finding a lobby. You can also play missions solo. Although Not very much missions, theyre meant to be replayed multiple times and they arent very long. (depends on the difficulty you play it on?) but it was enjoyable. Create your fighter complete missions to earn money and rank up and unlock skills and customize your avatar with gear that effects your playstyle. upcoming dlc will add more to multiplayer.  Overall my rating is 7/10  Would recommend purchasing it on sale. 
1681	Great Game!!!!  I love the post apocalyptic tech things and the story line and open world take over places concept
1682	It was free for 3 days. YAY i said. Installed the game, maxed it out (bad choice) Game ran like â¥â¥â¥â¥. On the first cutscene, the guy had no torso/arms (like that GTAV bug). No audio at all. On the next cutscene, one of the guards is invisible and because of that, a blue briefcase is floating. Game crashes. Doesnt start anymore. Reinstalled twice. I have 1TB of disk space. Third time i tried to install it says i cant download it. Why? No disk space. GG  Good experience. 10/10  Edit: Before maxing out the game, i also ran it in the lowest possible. Same bugs and same performance as maxed out. And i used 1366x768 resolution, so to the fanboys whining on the commentaries, please try to ask more information about my setup/settings before calling me a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ &lt;3
1683	I have been playing this game from the beginning, well before the patch's that Dambuster studio's has been putting out, don't believe me check my hours.   Would I suggest people to play it, Damn right YES I would. The story is amazing and alot longer than I would have even expected, the gameplay is even better, come on who doesn't like setting up daisy chains and driving an RC car packed with either a molotov or C4 strapped onto it into a nicely set up murder zone. Yes it has co-op but this game isn't all about its co-op mode which can also be pretty nice, its about the single player game.  If you want multiplayer go back to the biggest multiplayer map called 'The World' in the award winning game called 'Your Real Life'   To be honest, other than a couple instances of drop in frames per second I have yet to have any game breaking bugs.  Not like the fun falling through the ground in Battlefield 4, dieing to invunerable npc's in The Division or the downright annoying crashing in Fallout 4.  For all those scrubs who are about to â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ I run an I7 Intel chip and a high end graphics card. I have yet to find a game which doesnt run at 60-80fps on ultra settings.  I should further mention it is becoming common practice for alot of high end game production teams including bethesda and the notorious ubisoft for releasing games which should have spent more time in the bug testing phase than we actually got in return. Effectively producing games which should not even be available to purchase.  Now how does it differ hear, firstly Dambuster studios is a much smaller company and more importantly they actually listened to all of the problems from both genuine gaming enthusiast's and the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ing from scrubs and managed to fix alot of the games problems.  All I can say to all of those whiney idiots who need a fresh nappy and their dummy is, that the story is beautifully put together ok yes its a little cliche but let me say this clearly.  ITS A DAMN GAME STFU.  Also I will finish this with at least it isn't 'No Man's Fail'  So while I wait for the first expansion and more importantly The Walking Dead Season 3 from Telltale games, time for some Witcher 3.
1684	This game is fine and fun. The misions are kinda repetetive yes, but that's like that with every Open World Game (nearly). The story is okay.
1685	fantastic game, this one is better than the first.
1686	Honestly, had a lot of fun with this game. Might just be my pc specs, but had no performance issues whatsoever and the game looks great. Wouldn't buy for full price, but definitely pick up in a sale
1687	This game is fine and fun. The misions are kinda repetetive yes, but that's like that with every Open World Game (nearly). The story is okay.
1688	fantastic game, this one is better than the first.
1689	This is a fantastic game. Graphics are good, the gameplay is realistic, especially the vertical movement.
1690	The game played fine for a little bit, but then started crashing. After the first crash, I was not able to play for more than 5 minutes before it crashed again. This sucks, because what I played was actually quite fun. Being able to customize your weapons on the fly was great, and reminded me a lot of Crysis. However, I can't recommend a game that just doesn't work. Don't buy this game. EVER. You may not get crashes, but it's not worth the risk. If they do another free weekend, then I say try it out. Otherwise, just stay away.
1691	  (Single player review)  Graphics: 10/10 - nothing to complain about Music: 8/10 - fits really good Voice Acting: 7/10 - overall pretty good Story: 3/10 - a bit too unrealistic for me  Bugs: You might have to load last checkpoint sometimes as objects or animations might get stuck. Got thrown of the map twice.  Casual completion time: ~8 hrs  If you like the Far Cry game-style, you'll feel right at home in this one.  Thank you for the free weekend :)
1692	FREE WEEKEND FOR A SINGLEPLAYER GAME. This show the quality of this game  This is just another boring, slow, repatative game. No wonder why this game was crushed by DOOM.  its like a boring version of far cry series and runs worse than far cry 4 at launch  3/10  atleast the graphics are good, but bad rats would still be â¥â¥â¥â¥ if the graphics looked good
1693	  Homefront: the Revolution, not a perfect game by any means. Having said that, I don't understand why there is so much hate on this game. I realize it had a terrible launch, however it does seem like they've fixed most of the bugs. It only crashed on me once near the beginning which caused me to have to replay about 5 minutes. Other than that, a few graphic bugs mostly but nothing gamebreaking. My specs are   i7-6700, gtx 960, 16gb RAM   and I had about 45-60 fps on all high settings. The AI is pretty bad but not gamebreaking, at least not for me. The story was pretty basic, nothing special but it did it's job. I managed to finish the story during the free weekend so I didn't actually buy it. However on it's 40% off sale (or if you can get it even cheaper) I would say it's worth it, not at full price though.     Overall Rating
1694	  Very smart of the developers to have a free weekend on Steam, I would have never taken notice of this game otherwise. I'll buy it once it's finally done, still not 100% bug-free and still needs PvP and a proper way to spectate.
1695	Very repetitive much like farcry : free checkpoints until main mission unlock , AI is dumb , average game at best and not worth the price , the good thing is I tried it during free week-end.
1696	Only positive I can say about this game, is that you can play as a grandma in resistance mode :)
1697	Interesting game mechanics similar to Far Cry in the aspect of taking over strongholds and other various points on the map however that's pretty much all you end up doing area's may look different but it's a rehash of the same events.   This game sadly fails to capture the grittiness of the previous title which is a missed opportunity on the developers part. You geniunely feel no attachment to any character or the struggles America is going through this entire game. As the previous title you had a lot of gut churning moments at how monsterious an invading force can be however it's downfall was how short the game was.  Despite it being free over the weekend I personally have played enough to say I won't be purchasing the game as I've experienced all the game has to offer for me, I didn't have a chance to play the multiplayer aspect of it but I don't feel like I am missing out on much, I'd say it's a 5/10 kept my attention for a bit and the appeal wore off shortly after.
1698	This game certianly doesn't deserve all the negativity that I have seen surrounding it, though its far from a perfect game.  The levels and missions can become rather repetative and there isn't nearly enough weapons in the game and it dissapointed me on the 'Open World' aspect, as it's nothing like a true open world game.  However, the levels are large, there is plenty of side missions to keep you busy for hours, the weapon customizing is quite cool, the AI, Alarm system, change of surroundings as the game progresses, these are all fantastic.  If this game is on sale (Like it is on the Humble Store) I'd certainly pick it up.
1699	Best graphics i have seen in a while, uses alot of ram and graphics but if your pc is storng enough i recomend
1700	I played both Homefront. I really loved the athmosphere in both games. Both games had a lot of critics. Both games are that type of games that not everybody like. What can I say about this game:  The Graphic is very good. The Sound is good. I didn't saw much bugs in this game, so this is pretty good. But when I first buyed the game I had a lot of problem cuz of the lag. The game was laging to much. I even thought to send the game to hell and don't play it cuz of this. But I solved the problem. And enjoyed it. So this is a big bad thing. The story itself is... interesting. But a lil boring. I liked the 'far cry' system of the game, but it's so repetitive. The IA is good. On hard mode the enemy is letal. In the first part of the game, exactly. I can't say nothing about the multiplayer cuz nobody plays it. But I really enjoed the game. This game give you to think a little. Why are you doing this? Are you on the right side? And how to conquest a point aswell. You can choose action or stealth.   It's a good game in the end. I buyed it for a couple of rubli ( cuz I'm from Russia ) and I can say that this game does not cost the price of 70 euros ( cuz new games in Europe cost like this, I'm saying it like this so you can understand what I mean ).   7.5 of 10
1701	Homefront: The Revolution is an open world first-person shooter video game and has some great aesthetic devices and a cool concept, however, the game felt repetitive, unpolished in my opinion. Also, I had some issues with it detecting my mechanical keyboard, which has RGB backlighting for some weird reason it kept on changing the color of it and I think the game engine didn't like the corsair software which was strange. I would recommend this game, however, isn't worth the asking price of Â£29.99 which it was before the steam sales.
1702	Game is completely broken. Outside of the game glitches the consistent stuttering, screwed up FOV (on ultrawide displays) and horrible endless spawning of enemies just makes this game completely not worth playing.
1703	This game is a bit hard to get used to, it is a totally different FPS shooter playing style where 'hit and run' is the best tactic. Going in guns blazing will get you killed every time. I like the strategic aspect of planning the attack and figuring ou how you can approach the target the best. Awesome game, doe not get boring anytime soon!
1704	Honestly, sometimes you just need a dumb shooter that's easy to pick up and put down. The mechanics are simular to Far Cry and the city setting is kinda cool.  DON'T play this for the story. DO play this if you just want something to play that you don't need to get too invested in.  Doesn't deserve any awards, but it's fun in the blowing off steam after work/school
1705	Game is completely broken. Outside of the game glitches the consistent stuttering, screwed up FOV (on ultrawide displays) and horrible endless spawning of enemies just makes this game completely not worth playing.
1706	So... I know why people were alittle mad about the game as the AIs still were idiotic when in combat, you die way to fast, have a limited amount of weapons plus expansion mods of said weapons. But overall the graphics are awesome, I like shooters and being able to craft so that was a plus, and the storyline was well I havent finished yet but right now its good a little bland and also bull at the part I am on. But otherwise I would recommend this game very open world with different styles also I like the fact that the redzones arent has hard as the yellow zones

1708	Found a Time Splitters 2 mini-game. Damn nostalgia trip 10/10
1709	Actually a very good game. I liked it so much, I bought several of the DLC's.
1710	To be honest, when I first started playing this game I was not very impressed - every time I encountered the KPA a huge gunfight would ensue and I would die pretty quickly (also partly due to my average shooting skills). I forced myself to play on, and the more I played, the more I loved it..... As you gain the hearts and minds of the locals, and get some better firepower, defeating the KPA is much more of a fair challenge than early-on. I have played almost 50 hours and don't really have any idea how far through the story I am at the moment, but the game grows on you and I am really enjoying it now... The story is great, graphics very nice - I am getting over 90FPS with a 6600k and a GTX 970 on highest settings - and most of the mechanics and game-play aspects are good, no complaints. I love how you can run (sprint) infinitely and the gun mods and upgrades are all great too  After a rocky start, I would give the game 8/10
1711	Tons of fun, great graphics, sweet in game weapon customization. I'm not sure why this game has gotten â¥â¥â¥â¥ on so hard, but after considering it for a month or so, I decided to purchase it on a sale, and haven't regretted it. Check it out if you like open world, fps, or just want to try something that will happily surprise you.
1712	Great game, with some interesting easter eggs. Enjoyed to play, I am one of the few people who go from new game to new game. Forgeting about the old. But when it comes to homefront nothing can replace the classic. 
1713	I really don't know why this game has so many negative reviews. At first I hesitated buying this game because of its bad reviews, but then it went on sale (13.56$) so I bought it. Now I'm 5 hours into the game and I am really enjoying this game. Although its fps are low, I have i7 6700k, 16GB ram and gtx 1080 and I'm getting 35-45 fps while all setting maxed out. I was expecting 60+ fps with my rig.
1714	This game is really good for single player. I thoroughly enjoy the righteous Merica mentality of it all. The open world aspect can be off putting but i think it allows for great emergent game play moments, ex, i took over a small appartment rooftop in a controlled contested area of a high security section of the city, and i started sniping the N. Koreans and started this huge battle, running roof top to roof top, like 5 star level GTA type crazy response by the NorKs but it was awesome because the resistance was joining the battle, oppressed civilians started attacking the NK soldiers and the whole thing felt really organic. It's a fun game.
1715	This game is a bit hard to get used to, it is a totally different FPS shooter playing style where 'hit and run' is the best tactic. Going in guns blazing will get you killed every time. I like the strategic aspect of planning the attack and figuring ou how you can approach the target the best. Awesome game, doe not get boring anytime soon!
1716	So... I know why people were alittle mad about the game as the AIs still were idiotic when in combat, you die way to fast, have a limited amount of weapons plus expansion mods of said weapons. But overall the graphics are awesome, I like shooters and being able to craft so that was a plus, and the storyline was well I havent finished yet but right now its good a little bland and also bull at the part I am on. But otherwise I would recommend this game very open world with different styles also I like the fact that the redzones arent has hard as the yellow zones
1717	not sure why so many people are mixed on this, its a great game, great look, works well and charactors look real
1718	At least level design is decent so you can enjoy what is it looks like when america city in ruin (?  gameplay is mediocre, it's not really interesting but not â¥â¥â¥â¥ either  about A.I sometimes enemy working as intended, sometimes dumb as hell  maybe pick this game when it's cheap
1719	I waited to purchase this game, because of all the bad reviews and bugs that were reported. I have played for a few hours and I have to say that the game is keeping my interest. No, it is not the most graphically stunning game I have ever seen, but it is certainly not deserving of all the trash talking that went on when it was first released. Additionally, the gameplay is somewhat repetitious, but I like it. It's simple, straight forward fun. I am currently playing the game on easy; because I like a good story with some action mixed in. So far, the game is meeting my expectations and is addicting. I will raise the bar after my initial experience and report back. Overall, a good, fun game that is great for some simplistic fun.
1720	great! for 20 bux would not pay 60 but the sale i got it on was awesome no one seems to play multi though
1721	Okay I'm about 7 hours into this game and I can't understand where all the bad reviews come from. Is it a perfect game? No, it's not. But for $11.99 I really can't complain one bit.  I'm playing the game on medium difficulty and it can still be very challenging. You must strike and move otherwise you will get shot up very fast.  Every once in a while, I try to climb into a hole in the wall or window and the game wonât let me. This usually leads to death or wasting health packs. This is my only complaint. But it doesn't warrant the bad press this game has. Maybe earlier version were less stable? I can't really say, because I bought the game during the winter sale of 2016.  Honestly if I bought this game earlier for around $30 I still would probably be happy with it. Go ahead and give it a try, it may surprise you.
1722	This game is currently underrated. That may not have been the case 6 months ago when steam/professionals reviews nominated it the biggest AAA poopstain of 2016. Six months later, a lot of the technical/gamebreaking bugs are gone. What's left is something of an urban Far Cry clone with a pretty outlandish story that delivers a few different gameplay elements in a pretty above-average way. I spent about 50 hours playing it and I enjoyed myself.   Setting: North Korea won the Korean War, uniting the entire peninsula and creating the world's foremost technological superpower. Years later, the US is depleted and heavily dependent on Korea. The Koreans take advantage of this and essentially take over the US under the pretense of peacekeeping. You are a newly recruited revolutionary in the Philadelphia branch of the resistance against the takeover.   What you may like:  -Above average artistic presentation. Good textures with limited popping. Dynamic day/night cycle. Quality motion-captured animations. The resistance fighters look cool.  -Level design is top notch. Lots of nooks and crannies for you to scavange and take potshots at the enemy form. Very vertical with lots of parkour, with lots of open-ended methods of approach. The different areas of the game vary enough to keep it fresh despite you doing basically the same thing.   What you may not like: -Still quite buggy, although not game-breaking. I was not able to complete some side jobs. I fell through the world once. Some texture flickering. -The story is pretty ridiculous and the enemies are kinda goofy/comicbookish. They look like some brokeass power rangers mixed with the guy from Speed Racer. I'm pretty sure the designers went for this look on purpose, to create a B-Movie kind of atmosphere.  -No matter how you pamper it with quality level design, capturing a tower is still capturing a tower. This is basically like an urban far cry, so if you are tired of that, look elsewhere.   Everything else: -Although the weapon modification system is interesting, the upgrades to the weapons are boring stat boosts -Even though the actors did a great job delivering it, the overall writing of the story is pretty cheesy.  -The enemy AI itself is not bad. Enemies flank, take cover, and attack in groups.However, sometimes enemies will appear/disappear right in front of your face.  Conclusion:  If you're itching for a quality urban far cry experience, this is for you. The game doesn't stray too far from that formula. The level design is easily the best part of this game, and it kept it pretty fresh throughout. It's still pretty buggy but the massive game-breaking bugs seem to be gone. I quite enjoyed the different areas of its open world, and thought they were pretty varied, even moreso than many of its competitors.
1723	This game is what the first HomeFront game should have been. rich stroy telling. Nice open world maps. tons of fun. A must buy.
1724	19h Incl Idle time to finish all SP.  All the trouble the game Dev team ran into regrettebly did not improve the outcome, It's an average game at best with allot of repeats,  It's been out for a while and thus i don't really feel the need to write a full on review.   Did not try The restance mode.  If its cheap enough its a decent buy just to mess about a bit.
1725	As many reviews here show, gamers these days have mutated into a bunch of cry-babies.  This game has some technical flaws but is no way a bad game.  Just a few minutes into this game and i love it already.  ***UPDATE: After spending 3h into the game i must say, despite some technical flaws of course, this is one of the best shooters i played lately. I love the graphics, the atmosphere and the way how missions progress. On hardest difficulty you really have to carefully use stealth-tactics, every rambo-style gameplay works as well....that means if you dont have a problem with dozens of mission-restarts until you finally made it.  Its really a miracle to me how this game gets such bad critics and when it comes to the technical flaws i have to say i actually play with FXAA and everything else on highest setting, and all i get is some slight stuttering at certain surroundings which never became annoying enough to make me stop playing it.
1726	  Playin this during the free weekend, so take that with a word of warning.  Pro: Lots of side content. Upgradeable gear and weapons. Weapons can switch between 3 types, i.e. Pistol, SMG, Silenced Pneumatic Pistol. Side tools are neat to use. The ambiance/mood of the world is pretty nice for the setting it is in.  Con:  Some of the actors are pretty bad. Sound shorts out for the radios and some of the enemies, but not enough to hender gameplay.  If you liked Watch_Dogs, you'd probably like this game, but thats not saying much since you probably aren't reading this far into the positive reviews anyways.
1727	I hoped so desperately that this game would take chances. Sadly, it had no balls.
1728	  A lot of people are saying this game is bad, and I can see why, there a lot of bad elements to the game such as the horrific AI. But, in my sight I think its a fine game, gameplay was fun. The story was great, and the soundtrack was amazing. If only they worked a little harder they couldve made the game better, hopefully future updates will fix the game's issues and such.
1729	good game completed in 12.2 hours
1730	Homefront: The Revolution was one of the games that I was looking forward to playing this year being a fan of the Far Cry series, however, when it launched with so many performance issues and bugs I didn't bother to buy it. Now they have since optimised the performance and fixed a large number of bugs, I decided to give it a try the weekend where it was available for free. I have to say that in its current form I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys open world games and particularly if you like the Far Cry mechanics. Although it is still not perfect, and certainly could have taken its potential further but it is still a great game in its own right.  This is the first review I've ever written on Steam, and I felt like after such a poor reception the game first received it was only fair to give a positive account of my experience given the effort the devs have clearly gone to to put the game right.  Pros: Beautiful graphics Varied game styles (Yellow zone stealth, Red zone aggressive) Tried and tested Far Cry formula Weapon customisation RC Car bombs!  Cons: Unlikeable allies No reason for your character to be a mute Ridiculously fast respawns for the yellow zone Hearts and Minds activities Loot system could be more varied (e.g weapon mods, more craftable items)  I'd give this a solid 75% in its curent state and would highly recommend it if you can pick it up on sale. I purchased it, after trying it for free, at 40% off so it was Â£17.99. At that price it's well worth it
1731	  This game is just bad as the first Homefront, poor performance on a high-end system. I got myself a GTX1070 and i don't even get 60FPS with everything on high. It feels and plays like an poorly console port.

1736	I dont know why people dislike this game so much. I wanted to buy it when it came out, and didnt because of the reviews. Now, with the free weekend...I realize I should have listened to my gut and bought it.  It has great graphics and atmosphere.  It doesnt resonate as a rugged shooter feeling you get with other blockbusters. Much more of a Clean and Steady Axis.  I like Feeling Clean. Anger doesnt lead me and rage is detrumental to gameplay. Thats something the blockbusters might learn from Homefront.  Players look for esteem and accomplishment when they play games... I dare to presume that the negativity is simply because the gamers arent clean within themselves, their own spirit and identity...and more of any, lack a sense of patriotism, drive and deliverance.  Ive played only 2 hours and my opinion might change , but homefront is an enjoyable and challenging game. One where the gamer decides if he wants to banter, destroy and pummel...or rather cultivate and build.  Its a well made game...and im pretty sure I will purchase it when I can. If I dont finish it this weekend when its Free ;)  GG
1737	[Played during free weekend, I didn't really receive the product itself so I left the box unchecked]  Homefront: The Revolution is like, an urban Far Cry, but with North Korea having taken over the world so you've kinda got some themes from Wolfenstein: The New Order in there with the bad guys having taken over the world and all.  However, the gameplay is nothing like Wolfenstein: TNO and it doesn't have the animal hunting seen in Far Cry 3. That doesn't mean it's not fun, it's actually great to play and who doesn't love shooting up North Korea for good ol' America? As for the graphics, I find them pretty nice and the faces also are visually appealing as well although I do hate it when designers give facial piercings to a character (as I hate facial piercings).  Pros: -Great gunplay -Fun weapon modding system -It's like an urban Far Cry 3 -Runs great on my PC (thanks, performance patch) -Interesting concept -Neat soundtrack  Cons: -Multiplayer resources should've been spent on the game itself, as no one would play Homefront for the multiplayer (and no one plays FPS multiplayer if it isn't CS:GO or CoD). While the multiplayer is fun (I only played solo as I couldn't find any lobby), I'd have avoided creating it altogether as people only play CS:GO or Call of Duty or hell, why not make the multiplayer a standalone experience instead? -Some collision with some meshes like tarps are stupid and immersion-breaking, I should be able to go over those IRL. -Has Denuvo. It's a pos software that not only ruins modding but it also locks people out for overclocking their CPU, and even is known to lock out legitimate buyers, too.  Score: 8.5/10
1738	Singleplayer campaign is really good and fun. If you like Far Cry like games, you wil most likely love this game. It's a RPG shooter. Take over areas from bad guys. Find new gear. Runs smooth with great gfx.  I have plyaed like 3 hours (free weekend)
1739	I dont know why people dislike this game so much. I wanted to buy it when it came out, and didnt because of the reviews.

1740	Based off of the free weekend I tried, The only thing wrong I see about this game is that the performance is balls.   Other than that, its got a decent story with nice cutscenes, even the voiceover is good like you can tell the devs put a lot of effort. The graphics are really good too. It even plays like your typical Far Cry game but the setting is what really does it for me.   Set in Philadellphia where North Koreans have treated Americans like dogs, you must rebel and start resistances throughout different parts of the city to ultimately overthrow the 'Norks'. That is so sick! In Far Cry, you are just getting signals and revealing parts of the map!   Trust me, if this game was the original Homefront, people would LOVE this game. I think the reason why people hate on it hard is because of two things.  1) Poor optimization = I personally get 40-60 fps on a gtx 970, amd 8320fx and 16gb ram. I get that, that sucks but it does NOT warrant a negative review UNLESS the devs are not putting out patches.  From what I understand, they have been pumping patches and actually have a pastebin where they want people to submit their dxdiag logs to see what causes the issue.   THAT IS EFFORT. THEY ARE TRYING. WHY DONT YOU BECOME A DEV AND SEE WHY YOUR GAME LAGS ON DIFFERENT BUILDS. DO YOU SEE HOW IT COULD TAKE TIME TO DIAGNOSE THAT?  2) Unoriginal 'Far Cry 3' gameply - It has that 'scavenge, resource, and take over base' gameplay thats been replicated a lot. I dont mind it. That is all I did the first 3 hours and enjoyed it. If you dont likE that gameplay, that is also fine. It just suits different people well.  Overall, I plan on buying the game since the free weekend help me form an opinion on it.
1741	In the time i played this game, i can only say its amazing, and i know, i dont have a lot of hours in this game, not even 1 hour. But i can surely recommend this to you guys. 
1742	Overall the game was decent, the gameplay felt good, I had no game breaking bugs, and the few bugs that're there make for some funny scenarios. I had none of the game breaking bugs or lag issues that other people had, and I'm not exactly running the game on a high end rig.  My only issue with the game was it felt quite repetitive and forced in the story, and the story itself felt quite difficult to attach yourself to and immerse in the game, and the characters I found annoying and destroyed the enjoyability of the story later on in the game.  The online however can be great fun if you and a few friends want to hop on a coop game, although it can be quite difficult without a lot of experience. The unlock and buying system used for online is tedious, and takes a long while and many of the same, few missions to unlock, the lack of variety in the online missions kills it pretty quickly because it just gets repetitive and boring after a while.  All in all, the game is decent, the gameplay feels fluid and reactive, the parkour around the map can be frustrating at times, but feels rewarding at fun most of the time. It's main downfalls is a lack of replayability, and being really repetitive, coupled with a very draw out, forced story.
1743	This game had so much potential, but it failed miserably.   The stealth is awful. Enemies can see you through walls or can't see you until you are standing in front of them. Distraction grenades can be thrown while en enemy is shooting at you, and they will look at the grenade that they saw you throw. Horrible.   Movement feels clunky and awkward. Weapon customization is not what it seems. A M4 can be turned into a grenade launcher and a m249. You can change the sight, foregrip and muzzle on the guns. Very small changes that don't affect   I couldn't finish the story. I gave up on this game.   Everything about this game is half done and mediocre at best. It's worth maybe $20. I don't know if I'd pay that for this game.
1744	  Advice to publishers/developers : don't put games that can be finished under 15 hours on free weekend  Game is ok though
1745	So, to start things off, I'll have to say that this is the first game I've ever asked for a refund over.  I'll start off with what I like about it first, and I'm not a big proponent of listed items. I think the visual fidelity of the game is good, you can tell it was built on Cryengine, it LOOKS good, it was hard to get a good framerate when I played it, however that was right around the time it was released, and I returned it quite fast after playing it.  The gameplay foundations are also there, I can tell that this could be a solid game experience and its bothering that it simply but these features fall so flat on their face with some of the issues that just ruin everything that could be good.  One of the biggest design decisions was to make everything sort of open world and Far Cry-esque, but when you die, what the hell happens? You get stuck about a minute or two back in the game, or if you happened to get stuck by a checkpoint, good job. But if you didn't get to a checkpoint and happened to use a vehicle to get to your objective thats about a minute away with enemy patrols on your way? Well good luck, because that vehicle is no longer there anymore, and you lost a 'valuable item' or something like that simply for dying. So you get punished in a good few different ways just for dying! Enemies are randomized in their locations, you get set back fairly far in gameplay, you lose a valuable item, and if you used a vehicle? Good â¥â¥â¥â¥ing luck, its gone off into the oblivion. Its just so bloody confusing when you die, no idea where your progress was last set, so its just not worth trying to figure that out in my opinion.  This hurts though, because I love this sort of 'America has fallen' style game, Red Dawn is one of my favorite movies ever, but this game just doesn't work for me.  If someone ever comes back and tells me that these issues have been fixed, I'll give this game a try again, because believe me, I really wanted this game to be good.

1747	After the 2.0 patch the game is playable and enjoyable. At first there is a bit of a learning curve but so far it's been pretty good.
1748	  characters = basic plot = mediocre level design = very nice sounds = not bad potential = so much.but not executed properly. replayability = a little. stealth = ...what stealth? enemy AI = ...what enemy?
1749	I remember how Homefront was advertised as coop story game. Finally, I bought the game aaaand... THERE IS NO STORY COOP. It has extremely sh**y resistance mode coop with absolutely independent missions. Moreover it is impossible to find any1 for coop missions. SO if you dont have a friend, never buy the game for coop!  I'm dissapointed, sadly, cant return the game as I left it working in background for todays night :(
1750	This game is great, yes it has bugs but graphically it looks good, you do only have access to 1 vehicle, but if you love explossions and big guns this game is great, the story is a bit slow and the game is pretty FarCry 4 esk, but if you buy this game, buy it with no expectations, a clean slate and you will enjoy this game.
1751	it a fun game - i give it 7 out 10
1752	This game is awesome i can see it just from the start. but there is only one problem: OPTIMIZATION!!  I'm on GTX 960 and its running on 30 fps for â¥â¥â¥â¥ sake!!  Fully agree:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtfV5gHKzvo 
1753	Brady? Brady. Good. Brady, come here. Brady I got some Freedom here. Brady, take the Freedom. Deliver it to the Norks. Brady? Are you there Brady? Good. Now take that area, Brady! It's important. For Amerika. Brady. Are you following this, Brady? Good. We're glad to have you with us, Brady. Did you deliver that Freedom? Brady? Brady?  7/10 would Brady again.
1754	Great Graphics[besides the crates disolving], Decent Gameplay[the econemy/modding/crafting, the open world][besides the driving, and the ai], Overall I like it, but it keeps randomly freezing
1755	Underrated. Had fun playing it.
1756	  Homefront: The Revolution   *was*   a bad game, but now that the game is patched I can happily say it's pretty solid. Sure it's no masterpiece but for a low price you get a Far Cry like experience in an urban environment. Can't really complain about that.
1757	Game is obviously lacking many many good features a AAA game like any other on it's category should have, it runs poorly and not even with a high end pc can achieve a decent amount of fps, framedrops everywhere...even more when restocking ammo and quicksaving were the game will freeze for even 5 seconds killing immersion on a very savage way. Story is decent, but seems rushed, clichÃ©, and has a very forced air into it. Game mechanics aren't bad, I like that you have to make a district react and rise(that's a revolution after all) but how you achieve it is so repetitive that it can be obnoxious, tiring and for some people, not worth the try due to the horrible optimisation problems we've already talked about. Weapon system is by far a thing I would be praising about this game since it was done very well, the conversion of a marksman rifle to a 'freedom launcher' would make me giggle and murder incontable enemies with explosions and joy and the rain effects were in my opinion..sublime due to the fact that things such as the ground, clothes and everything else gets wet in real time, drop by drop. It's truly a shame that this was opaqued by the poor way the game would run. Would I recommend thia game? only as an experiment and a reminder that the all glorious PC Master Race has it's own derps(even though I was told console versions was even worse) but absolutely never by full price. It's only worth if you feel like reviewing it, having the experience by yourself and finally because of the trading cards, an overall game that had so much potential and all the terrain it had left behind because of mistakes that for some looked like little and finally made the game pretty much unplayable for almost everyone.
1758	While its a solid enough game, there are some technical isues, (nothing dealbreaking, just the ocational framerate stutter.) Even so, I found I quite enjoyed It, and the story even tuged my heartstings ocationally. but the multyplayer, aulthought rather well put together, has no vs mode. therefor, no one is playing it.   Get it if you want singleplayer, and at least try the multi (which can be played single, but you will die) 6 out of 10, has potential though
1759	I've only put 4 hours in so far, but it's enough to answer a few questions for a potential buyer. First, my system specs. Dell Inspiron 7000 laptop. I7, 960m, SSD, 16gb ram. Nothing hardcore. I run the game on medium settings at 1080p and average a solid 30 fps. The game still looks good on medium and 30 fps is just fine with me. There are some glitches with the AI on occasion, but for the most part they act like any other games AI. The story line is enough to justify the game. I'm a big fan of Farcry, I get most of my enjoyment out of taking the the enemy strongholds and I get plenty of that here. So far the red zone was exactly what I enjoy, we'll see what the other two zones have to offer. 
1760	I'm not really sure what to think at the moment, I am kinda shocked to be honest. I expected more out of this game, it can't even compare to the first one. Sure it had its moments however over all it felt kinda dull to be honest, the atmosphere felt kinda nice and the graphics wasn't that bad however the story line was weak and it didn't really capture you the player EVER.  To me a great game needs to capture the player like it does in The Last of Us or other games where you just wanna keep playing and playing and playing and wish it never ends. This game never does that and you play on wishing it would end faster yet the developers keep draging out a thin story as long as it goes without making it better or more exciting.  This is an open world game in the style of Far Cry 3, 4 and Primal, you get different 'bases' to take over throughout the game and it just goes on and on and on without any major changes.  You could bascially say this is a remake of a Far Cry game or any other open world capture points game, without the fun and exciting story and instead a pretty dull and weak story and a fairly predictable one too. And not to forget MUCH WORSE, if you're thinking of buying this game then buy Far Cry 4 instead!  Oh and not to forget, the AI in the game is just crap to be honest. They get stuck everywhere and act all weird etc.  I feel like I've wasted my money, money that I could have used to buy some ice cream or some cola, that would have brought me more joy than this game and at least I wouldn't feel like I've wasted my money on something completely useless.  I really liked the first Homefront, you got captured in the story and it was really likeable as a game.  This game gets 2/10  I would not recommend other players to buy it at the moment because like I've said it's like a Far Cry game without the fun or exciting parts.
1761	Performance, Bugs, Stupid AI
1762	This game is quite possibly the biggest diasappointment to date. There is constant frame rate lag, the graphics are a step above last gen console games, and the game is extremely repetitive. All in all the game is not worth the $60 price tag it comes with because of all of the issues it has and the lack of story line a replayability. It just feels like it was a game on the Xbox 360 from about 4 years ago. The game generally feels like the dev team gave up on their vision half way through and decided to make a sub par game instead. 4/10 Would not reccommend
1763	Had such high expections and was let down so bad...  The frame rates suck (980 ti G1) Graphics suck Constant stuttering and freezeing  Controls suck  At one point i jumped out the window into the street and fell threw the road followed by a crash to desktop.  How they could release this game and charge the money they do for it i have no idea.   Dont buy it.  
1764	I've only put 4 hours in so far, but it's enough to answer a few questions for a potential buyer. First, my system specs. Dell Inspiron 7000 laptop. I7, 960m, SSD, 16gb ram. Nothing hardcore.

1765	The reason that i dont recommend this game is that its far over priced for the the short story line it has but it the story line is good but to short fot the price of it
1766	For a $60 game, this is not okay. Graphics are bad, repetive gameplay, and no real choices. Little varity in the world. There are two types of enemies that you come across. NO VARIATION in them. Just not a very good game.
1767	fine, but not living up to potential. The review is ONLY regarding the story-mode, seeing that i only played this mode so far.  I feel somewhat constricted in my opportunities to revolt against the 'KPA', so far its the same everywhere i've gone. Take over one part of the city at a time by doing the exact same thing i just did in the previous part of the city.  Setting up ambushes and fighting a superior force occupying your territory seemed alot more interesting in the trailers and it gave the impression of a vast array of opportunity to fight back.  The very structured progression is also a contributor to the constricted feel, because there is no real open-world. It's is for all intents and purposes a level based story-mode. one level being one part of town, and the next being a different part of town.  The controls of the game also feel off. Coming from Dying light that i just finished, the controls of Homefront are severly awkward. Wonky at best. And there is a lack of details that would have given the game a little more 'umphf'. Like looting is just a loadbar, no hands fiddleling, no hands reached for the drawer. The drawer just magically opens when you click, and you dont pick anything up. You just get a text on your screen telling you what you picked up.  On the plus side though, the story and game idea has massive potential.  And the combat is really nice, im not sure how they made the controls so wonky but still managed to make the combat feel solid.   in conclusion its a decent game, but i feel pretty riped off price wise. I would have much rather waited 4-6 months and bought it on sale for 20-25 euro's.
1768	This game is bad, it's really bad, don't buy it. Such a dissapointment. It's not even because of bugs or bad framerate, game is flat and boring. If you really want to waste your money, then buy some other games, this one is not worth it.
1769	  I have mixed feelings about Homefront: The Revolution. On one hand, I thought it looked nice for the most part, and played like your average shooter, but at the same time the animations, and especially the mouths when speaking looked really janky. To top it off I experienced a good deal of bugs including multiple crashes to desktop. I liked the game, but I wish it worked better. I would say buy at your own risk, but do check it out if you are interested.
1770	 HomefrontÂ®: The Revolution
1771	I have to admit the game started out rough on launch, but the game is a decent open world first person game in the same vein as Far Cry and Crysis. You have to temporarily suspend your disbelieve of the story. It would have been far more plausible if it were russians, chinese or even the british. But the north koreans seem abit far fetched to be honest. THe gameplay on the other hand took inspiration from Far Cry and made the theme work. Driving the motorcycle and rc car bombs is incredibly over sensitive, which makes maneuvering them a chore, and the gun play seems average at best. Stealth works fine and the world do make the game interesting. The game do occasionally have it's bugs but none of them I have encountered through my playthrough I would say, game breaking. In it's current state I would say the game is far from perfect, but neither is it a turd. It's an average game with alot of decent mechanics. I would say, give the game a chance if you like open world in the same vein as far cry.
1772	OK, I recomend this game - with reservations. Only giving thumbs up for balance.   I loved old Far Cry games. 4 wore on me. I liked primal but despite the change up it still was jungle far cry. This despite not being 'far cry' is far cry in a city and I am actually enjoying it a lot.   Heres the reservations after only a couple hours in, and I will update.   Runs 60 fps for me on gtx 760 but have to turn a few things down. Still amazing atmosphere. I have had a random black screen freeze up and crash to desk top so it needs work on the optimization side. So, yeah seems rushed tbh.  Yet, if you liked Far Cry 3 but might enjoy it in a burned out city this may be for you. I suggest finding on sale. It does mix things up a bit and far cry in a city is almost falloutesque at times. Definitely reminds me of Dying LIght without the zombies.  I DGAF about the short freezing when it auto-saves. All in all the game seems rushed but it's OK. I think the critics were a bit harsh though. 7/10 (so far)
1773	Just finished it, overall I enjoyed it, took me two days to finish it.  Played it on medium on a gtx 970 with 60 fps, still looked nice enough for me. Everybody keeps complaining about bugs, I got 3 crashes and everytime the game crashed the keyboard settings were mixed up. Still, that's not so many bugs. Oh and once a civilian NPC made me stuck in a corridor, so I ended up kiling him.   I wanted to play this game like an infiltration game, but the stealth part is a bit wooky-dooky if you know what I mean. Hs don't os with the silenced pistol so that makes it even harder.  I bought it for 23 euros and I don't feel like I wasted my money, 20 hours to finish and FPS is kind of unusual nowadays.  I haven't tried the coop part, I'll update my review once I have !
1774	the game feels more like a free to play shooter then a 60 $ title.... think they needed more time developing, its just note worth the money
1775	boring gameplay... just one or two missions were actually entertaining after that same gameplay through out the game ... also open world of this game is not that good .... nothing much to explore ... personal thoughts ... i have played this game for about 7 hours and now i wish shouldnt ... i can get refund now :/
1776	instead of buying this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game where they remove all the fun from the first game set your money on fire and watch it burn down slowly thats the same feeling you will get when buying this game and launching it for the first time.....    0/10
1777	First review of a game I've ever done. Everyone knows about the performance issues so I don't even need to start with that. Beyond the performance issues, the game seems pretty fun considering the fact that I got half way through the game and had to restart because of a bug. Tried to play online but can't find a match so I can't talk about that.  Pros: Graphics? Maybe. Probably not. 5ish/10  Lag and FPS issues 10/10  Extremely Repetative Campaign 15/10   10/10 Would probably not recommend.   Would I recommend this game. Maybe if it worked.  Honestly, If I could refund or sell this, I would.
1778	one word to sum up the game (CRASH) start the game crash get it go 5 mins crash swich in to lowers setings run fine for 10 mins crash shut it off come back to it 10hours later crash get â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off ask for refund so i dont punch my pc  AMD FX 8320 3.50 GHz EVGA OC GTX 980 tuned up  so ya it looks like it wound be a good game if u can keep it running for more than 10 MINS   
1779	My little piece of review for this waste of money...  The single player part of it is OK, i didn't experience any bugs that the other reviews speak of,   the gun customization part was pretty fun, all you need is basically the Assult Rifle which you can spend ingame cash to upgrade to do more damage, reload faster, and more range, the AR can be customized by pressing X and can transfrom into 2 other forms, a LMG which is much more accurate at fireing full auto then the AR, and a Gernade Launcher which locks onto vehicles (range is pretty limited, but the maps aren't big enough that you need to pack a RPG around).   The Snipers actually fight from range, thus you have a 2nd weapon slot, which i've equiped a Battle Rifle [Sniper rifle and a weaker gernade launcher], depending on the range of the enemy, you can swap out different scopes at ease.   Flashpoint missions are repetitive, and occures way too often, there also isn't a better reward nor punishment for doing/not doing Flashpoint missions,  now enough about the single player portion, now the Multiplayer Part.  ................. i can't think of what to write here, because my experience of the multiplayer portion consists of only doing 1 thing.... WAITING i've waited close to 30mins in a lobby waiting just for 1 person to join so that i can experience the multiplayer, but my paitence ran thin at 30 mins, and i can't start the lobby with myself as the game prevents me from doing so. having finished the singleplayer, i felt there was nothing more to do so i quit the game.  Will try the multiplayer part again soon, hope either more people start playing multiplayer or for the Dev to fix the lobby queing process
1780	before i bought this game i read alot of negative reviews and could not believe the game could be so bad ,to be honest i can not even come up anything positive to say. it is not one particular thing for me it is just everything, walking ,running ,riding ,shooting ,noises and gunshots when there was nothing going on , no noise in the heat of battle and i could keep going on and on. it is not fun to play. it is not that the game is so bad there are a lot of bad games out there ,it is the fact that the people that made this piece of crap are ok with charging me 60 dollars ,i have been playing computer games for a long time and have paid 60 dollars recently for some unbelievable games and i am ok with that. but i am not ok with this. then i started reading some of the positive reviews to find out what could be positive about this game and came to the conclusion that there must be two different games out there, i must have gotten one of the bad copies ,just my luck, can anybody tell me how to get one of the good copies.
1781	Just not a good game. Buggy, weapon handling feels weak. While I was brought in by the story everything else was horrible. Only purchase when on sale. Not worth at full price.
1782	Its pretty fun. Its not great but its fun enough to waste some time on. Get it on special.
1783	Played it for 25 minutes crashed 4 times while i could play it was only at 20-30 fps on low settings and still had massive fps drop every now and then. I got an -i5 6600k, 16gb ram, ssd drives, r9 280x 4gb- It's simply not worth the buy! I got a refund!!!
1784	I dont get why it has so many negative reviews, this game has almost everything Crysis 2-3, Far Cry 3-4, Dying Light, Metro, Division, MGSV, Call of Duty, Deus Ex Human Revolution and Mankind Devided and other games like this has and in many terms this game is much better than most of what i just listed, its quite realistic and mostly immersive (execept for UI and hihghlighting that breakes immersion), it has body awareness it has cool atmosphere which reminded me surprisingly Terminator, it has Koreans just like Crysis 1, execpt no nanosuit this time, and mostly it has core mechanics from Crysis which was and still as above most of FPS games in terms of game design.   Basically this is Crytek game, that was sold a little bit unfinished and was finished by Deep Silver, and i bet if name of developer was still Crytek this game would get much higher scores, and if it was A HIDEO KOJIMA GAME, everyone would give it a 10 or 20 of 10 just because of name or just because some critics said so, but in fact this game is way better than â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ MGSV, yet its score is lower, how the â¥â¥â¥â¥ is this even possible?  While crytek's Crysis (and despite different name, you can pretty much consider this game a Crysis 4 without nanosuit and aliens, but with good old Koreans, it has all the *CRY DNA in it) game has some difference to Ubisofts approach to crytek's legacy Far Cry, this game is pretty much similar to recent Ubisoft CRY games, its not worse at least, and average score of Far Cry 3-4 is about 7-8 of 10, which means that if people will start judging this game with their brains and not with reflective emotion like (OMG MY GAME CRASHES! -100 of 10! Found few minor bugs, -10 of 10! Has turned everything to ultra on my 5 years old unpotimised PC and game runs like â¥â¥â¥â¥, and desptie it has one of the best graphics and despite im dumb enough to try to disable heavy settings like SSAA its -10 - 10! and more dumb negative reviewes like this) this game cant have a score bellow 7 of 10 in worst case.  And i personally think it should has scores higher than MGSV, DXHR and DXMD, any Call of Duty, Crysis 2-3, Division, and other somewhat similar open world games and should have score nearly equal to Far Cry 3-4 and Dying Light, because these 3 are the closes matches to Homefront 2 (while 1 was just a plain Call of Duty clone) and this game has mostly same gameplay features and production values and overall quallity.  Yes, game is not perfect, there are some technical flaws that require extra polishing, some bad design decisions that require some changes (like ui customisation that dont break gameplay and allows to turn off more things separated to each other, fov slider that goes to at least 75, separate sliders for vertical and horisontal gamepad sensitivty, and deadzone, plus abilityu to rebind gamepad buttons freely or DECRYPTED CONFIG WITH BUTTON MAPPINGS THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY EDIT!, unlocked developer console - CryEngine Editor and workshop support for single and coop, ability to turn off highlight of interactive items, fully immersive phone mode that will show all menues in real time and in phone instead of going fullscreen, and some improvements to stealth to make it more realistic and challenging), but it does not make this game bad - it makes it not perfect, but its still good enough to enjoy its core, even if some details are flawed and frustrating,   This game honestly deserves 7 of 10 at this current state, if they will fix gameplay bugs and will improve some bad design decitions or will introduce some positive changes or alternate modes for more hardcore, immersive and realistic type of players, i think this game would deserve even a 8 of 10.  ALso im thankful for free weekend that allowed me to judge this game and for good discount of 40% that makes this game worth buying without regret. I can understand that at launch some people was frustrated because they paid full price and game was badly optimized and had crashes and other major bugs, but right now most critical issues are fixed and people can finally enjoy game, which is good, even despite some flaws still need to be fixed.   Just dont judge this game with emotions, use your brain and look at complex gameplay system, atmosphere, imnmersion, a lot of well designed features, very good graphics, good music, simple but suitable story, which is not very important in this game since its more or less simulator of resistant movement and story here only exist to glue simulation sequences together, its should not be cinematic as much as you blockbusters like Call of Duty, real life is not that enterntaining, and this games aims to reflect real life closer than you typical blockbuster games.  Oh, and it has quite intensive and enjoyable Co-op which is like stand alone game of Left 4 Dead kind, with Koreans instead of Zombies and has great replay value!
1785	I was really looking forward to playing this game years before it was released and sadly as the game was plagued with bugs and performance issues at launch to the point of being unplayable I decided to wait.   The thing is, now after months of its initial release date there are quite a few reviews saying that the game is patched now and runs very smoothly. To my dismay I bought the game believing what I read. While I know that my R9 graphics card is not the sharpest tool in the box it still runs most recent AAA games with 60FPS at the highest setting with few tweaks here and there.   This game, however, even though they patched it, It is still unplayable( for me at least). The game would run smoothly at 60 FPS or even higher and then without any apparent reason the frame rate would drop to half that number and in some cases the game just freezes. This happened to me very frequently to the point of making this piece of crap unplayable. I changed the setting but the same issues surfaced again and again... I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing give up.
1786	Sweet lord this game has issues. As with many others, I wanted nothing more than this game to be a success, but the first 30 minutes of gameplay have left me feeling cheated almost. The original Homefront had issues, but it was enjoyable to play regardless. If the combat was tight and on point like other games using the same engine then many issues could be looked past, but when the basics of movement, gun control and shooting feedback are lacking it is hard to physically continue playing without causing damage to ones keyboard, mouse or soul. It seems a higher priority was placed on quantity rather than quality... delaying this for another year would have been a better idea than releasing as is  I feel sorry for the developers and presenters of this as they must have been going through shock treatment to big up this one in front of the public. I will return to this one once a few patches come through, but i find it hard to believe it will rectify what feels like a unfinished game
1787	It doesnt work as it should, its not optimized very well
1788	Didn't make me want to play more for it.
1789	Worst Cry-Engine based game ever -.-
1790	No one seems to like this game, but I like this game!
1791	  Way too much cutscenes and You can't skip them. Watching this is a pain. I''m glad I had an opportunity to check it for free, it would be a waste of do$h for me.
1792	Kind of like shadow of mordor, only instead of orks you're killing norks
1793	36 gigs for this? are you kidding me?   not only is it a burden on your HDD, 30-40 mins before you even get to fire your weapon. dumbest easiest AI ive ever seen, laughable. runs like crap even with (newupdate) thank you free weekend for making me remember why i completely ignored this game to begin with.   graphics are nice i guess.
1794	a waste of 37.9GB runs well until you get into the open then it lags like someone tased my pc combat is boring and repetitive looks okay but its hard to admire the same dark wall and average lighting when youve seen it 20 times and your game lags whenever it renders more than a road sign, i couldnt even get out of the tutorial without my game jittering and freezing even though the fps counter said 50 overall, it is a boring and poorly made game with dissapointing combat and gameplay but has an okay weapon customization system.  
1795	I was very happy to see this game for free that weekend.. deleted some other games so i can install it.. and than first mission.. my npc is opening the door... and boom game freezes.. tried to check game files but no success.. steam couldn't fix it.. game is broken and devs are lazy (dumbustards is not only the name i guess ) and unfortunately i will play the cracked version when it's fixed because i don't trust a company that released a game and couldn't fix a common issue like that for more than 3 months (check the forums this issue is all over steam no matter what your specs are..) everything on pc is up to date running a gtx 980..  Fix your Sh*t devs!  if anyone wanna buy this game.. wait until it's fully fixed and buy it on sale or somthing.. but buying in the current condition.. even 20$ are way too much.
1796	  Played this during the Free Weekend. I had it on my wishlist for a long time, but did not want to commit any money to it because of the negative feedback it's gotten.  The game usually runs at a nice frame rate on High quality (GTX 980 Ti, i7, 8 GB RAM) but there are microstutters or uneven frame timings that make the game seem choppier than the frame rate suggests. Ultimately I couldn't even finish the first real mission because the game kept reproducibly freezing at a particular checkpoint, so I can't recommend this to anyone.
1797	  Sadly while I want to recommend this game, I just can't at this point in time. I read with anticipation all the reviews stating that the latest patches had fixed all the problems. I was one of the apparently few people who really liked the first Homefront game a few years ago so I eagerly awaited this.  However, for me, this is still broken. I can play it for about 10 minutes and then it freezes, locks up and I have to stop it from the Task Manager. The frame rates are usually ok but occasionally lag pretty bad which speaks volumes about how unoptimized this game is given I'm running it on a GTX 980, plenty of grunt for 1080p gaming.  I think this will be a great game if the dev's keep working on it but right now I just can't recommend it.
1798	the game is to choppy for me frame rate sucks
1799	I actually don't mind it, better than a large chunk of early access trash I've played and on sale costs much less.
1800	This review is after the september 2016 Patch. Do not buy this buggy mess of a game. They may have fixed the performance issue, well almost. But bugs galore and bad game design still remain.
1801	I expected nothing and I'm still let down
1802	Not worth it. Frame rate stutters no matter what settings I try. Gameplay is also mediocore and hugely repetitive. Spend your money on something else. 
1803	It was pretty fun but a 40gb install and repetivity made me quit.
1804	Not a fan. In weird ways the game is hand holdy, and in others it totally hangs you out to dry. 38 minutes before you even get to play. In that time your character gets knocked out twice, and beaten up another. Not a very heroic beginning.   The game world is a pain to move through. There are certain walls that I would like to walk on top of. As the wall is 2 feet wide this does not seem to be an irrational request; however, the only interaction that I am allowed with said wall is to jump over it. Not knowing this I jumped to my death.  The rules of engagement on alarms is very buggy. I was hidden in a building, and had broken LOS for three minutes, but the guards kept shooting me through the wall. never hitting or doing damage. As such I couldn't break the alarm.  On the plus side the graphics, lighting, and mood are all top notch. The story so far has been decent. It can be hard to keep the main story straight with all the side things that pop up on your way from A to B to complete a mission.  As you can see I dont' have much time in the game. I got it on a sale, and might come back to it at some point, but for right now I just dont' have the intrest in learning the game. Which is kinda sad because the story really looks promising
1805	This is actually quite a decent game
1806	Its system is look alike Far Cry3 but its OK for me because it isn't like Far cry theme
1807	  lets get something straight right here. This game plays 60FPS on high with a GTX 960 and the games looks amazing BUT i wont recommend because i go into the game i get to subway  i get to almost out of subway it freezes but i can still hear audio cant use pc anymore cancer
1808	Decent Far Cry 3 with an immersive city, and some of the worst voice acting in a video game.  Pick it up cheap!
1809	Good game for a free weekend, the concept is nice, capturing points like you do in Far Cry games but on a more smaller urban scale. Weapon customisation is limited, no silencer for a sniper for example and you use one primary weapon and a pistol that can convert to a small SMG.   Even on a free weekend there is little MP action going.  The graphics work perfectly fine for me but this is post launch and post patches.  The end is very much a let down and is just as scripted as most COD end scenes. The enemy in this is always a faceless foreign enemy with no real depth or insight. You face scores of soldiers yet there is no real threat or fear of what you are doing.   There is no real dread or fear compared to a game like HL2 where you are in a similar situation.
1810	I was intrigued from all of the early word on this one, decided to wait it out for the patches - grabbed it on the free weekend to give it a spin and bought it an hour later. This game has gotten some hard raps, mostly not deserved from I've seen. 11 hours in and this is one of the better titles I've played this year. It's gorgeous, well realized. Excellent sound design and weapon action. Great open world, does its own take on the Stalker/Dying Light/Half Life feels. Definitely the best Far Cry ever... Good writing, excellent acting, some musing on war what is it good for, interesting setting.  Absolutely â¥â¥â¥â¥ story though :) All in all a solid game, executed well, with some interesting design and slick minute to minute gameplay loops. Highly recommended. 
1811	Great Game So far But the Frames and the bugs cant wait till there fixed and is anyone else have this game crash ur computer with a red screen 
1812	  All this free weekend accomplished was giving more people an opportunity to expose this horrific chore that doesn't deserve to be called a game.  The characters you fight with are Haze (PS3) level loathable. They are the most annoying form of stereotypes to the point of me suspecting that I was supposed to hate them due to some predictable plot twist where they betray me and become my enemies... to my surprise this doesn't happen so I'm just left hating them without being able to shoot them in the face.  Gunplay is interesting initially but then you realize that non-story related gunfights are futile and useless because enemies infinitely respawn. I also don't like that I'm so easily killed, I mean I don't even realize that I'm about to die and all of a sudden I fall flat on my face. Customization is cool, if only it were tied to a different game.  Story... screw it. I got bored before clearing the first district because they were forcing me to 100% all of their generic tasks before advancing.  Multiplayer... idgaf. Tried it in the beta or alpha and it was mediocre.  Deleted before the weekend was even over.
1813	  I liked the original homefront, I thought it was a very good game and after trying this for about an hour I'd say they've gone backwards...the open world setting doesn't suit this game at all, the UI is clunky, the map is a mess full of icons and stuff to do, the game suffers from the ubisoft syndrome quite a lot. The story is really bad right from the start, it doesn't hook you or anything, but it's known that open world games have crap story so I wasn't expecting miracles.  The only good thing is the gun customization, I think it's very well done, however the gunplay doesn't feel very good at all, the aiming is weirdly snappy and sometimes even unresponsive so youre better off hip firing. Performance isn't something to brag about either. With my i5 3570k oc`ed to 4.6 GHZ and, GB gtx 980 ti xtreme and 16 GB ram the game runs on everything maxed out between 40 and 120 fps depending on the area and the dips are quite significant in some places. It's weird though sometimes in one particular area the framerate is stable and never goes below 60 and sometimes it gets choppy and dips even below 40.  Iam glad I had a chance to try this game for free and Iam happy I didn't buy it, there is a huge propability I never will, ever. The game is just not very good at all, there is no atmosphere, everything feels rushed and just weird.
1814	  Imagine playing Far Cry 3, on a wet mac, and Vass has been replaced by the CEO of Samsung. Kim Jong/Un
1815	  Played this during the Free Weekend. I had it on my wishlist for a long time, but did not want to commit any money to it because of the negative feedback it's gotten.  The game usually runs at a nice frame rate on High quality (GTX 980 Ti, i7, 8 GB RAM) but there are microstutters or uneven frame timings that make the game seem choppier than the frame rate suggests. Ultimately I couldn't even finish the first real mission because the game kept reproducibly freezing at a particular checkpoint, so I can't recommend this to anyone.
1816	Good game for a free weekend, the concept is nice, capturing points like you do in Far Cry games but on a more smaller urban scale. Weapon customisation is limited, no silencer for a sniper for example and you use one primary weapon and a pistol that can convert to a small SMG.   Even on a free weekend there is little MP action going.  The graphics work perfectly fine for me but this is post launch and post patches.  The end is very much a let down and is just as scripted as most COD end scenes. The enemy in this is always a faceless foreign enemy with no real depth or insight. You face scores of soldiers yet there is no real threat or fear of what you are doing.   There is no real dread or fear compared to a game like HL2 where you are in a similar situation.
1817	I was intrigued from all of the early word on this one, decided to wait it out for the patches - grabbed it on the free weekend to give it a spin and bought it an hour later. This game has gotten some hard raps, mostly not deserved from I've seen. 11 hours in and this is one of the better titles I've played this year. It's gorgeous, well realized. Excellent sound design and weapon action. Great open world, does its own take on the Stalker/Dying Light/Half Life feels. Definitely the best Far Cry ever... Good writing, excellent acting, some musing on war what is it good for, interesting setting.  Absolutely â¥â¥â¥â¥ story though :) All in all a solid game, executed well, with some interesting design and slick minute to minute gameplay loops. Highly recommended. 
1818	I wanted to like this game. I really did. It looks amazing, but the game is poorly optimized. I can't hold a steady framerate on low settings, the first mission glitched right off the bat and wouldn't let me continue, and the voice acting was completely offset the entire game. It was not enjoyable what so ever to me.  I'm glad I played this as a free weekend exclusive so that I could find out the investment isn't worth it.
1819	  my rig spec  6700k gtx970 16 gb ram  the rest you can imagine a dragon ( budum tss )  but let me tell you something the game is great in my opinion i enjoyed it,   I focused only on the main story it took me somewhere 10 - 11 hours to finish on easy  the beginning it was very glitchy for instance that happened  the waypoint purpose is for you to make sure to go forward right nope what it did made me go backwards then i go forwards to progress the story but if you didnt OBEY THE WAYPOINT you dont get to go forward the story but you can go through the map but if you see the norks they will shoot you if it wasnt like a starwars shoot out like come OOOOONN !!! im 1 cm close point blank on the gunSS BARREL ( 5 enemies all sides ) including the car on machine gun couldnt hurt me unless i go back to the waypoint then i can get shot stabed and getting run over by a friendly car you do get hurt from that on the final mission or any thing that moves to be honest .  then there is the weapons the only weapons you NEED IS THE MERUCA SHOTGUN why ??? you may ask OP that it and it also acts like a sinper if the buckshot reaches that certain place you want to shoot but if you want get another gun you will get in the main mission a rocket launcher but its useless 100% of the time i ended up using MY SHUTUPGUN to on CARS , MINI GOLAITHE THAT SHOOTS STUN GUN THAT GETS YOU KILLED SOMEHOW , and a seeker but really 1 shot on there weak spot with a shotgun it takes care of it or you can get automatic shotgun which does the job better and faster but not accurate the rest of the weapons is on you   the story its okay it didnt make me feel any emotion ON ALL CHARACTER even in the start all on the ending it kinda stupid and clitche but some momments is just too dull but the only character i only is heather forsome reason maybe she is an engeneire that why i feel her problame   i enjoed the game dont bother doing the side mission for the cash i got alot of cash on the main mission i have used them all for character upgrades guns and that's it to be honest you can finish the game without any to almost no upgrades the only upgrades you need is haveing more med kits   oh the only trasportation for you is only motorbike witch is better in my opinion and you are going to be a DAREDEIVEL because of its puzzel and riding arround the city   if you you are going to ask me how big is the map i didnt even check that go watch a youtube video much easier for me and you  guns customization just like crysis which it is cool   i know that people use Ctrl+Shift+Esc to get out of some games but for this game it's Ctrl+Alt+DELETE then star up task manager that's how you can get out of THIS GAME and also if the loading screen for somereason stoped working that means 2 things longer waiting or the game crashed that the window WONT COME UP TO TELL YOU THAT GAME CRASH OR STOPPED WORKING becasue that game is tightly locked DOWN LIKE NORKS GAMING LAAAAW   i give the rating a solid 7/10 if you dont mind the clitche mommnet , stupid AI , stupid way point AND COMEPLETE LOCKDOWN BUT REALLY it a good game you will like it but for buying it thats up to you if you dont mind playing only single player on HARD trust me easy it kinda dull but putting it hard my change my opinion on this review if i played it hard but i played it on easy to know the story and funny mooon roller blading knee it is it finiest norks army traning okay bye  how i got this game for free well it free to play for only 2 to 3 days long then goes back to buying them
1820	  I have heard a lot of negative aspects about this game. And after trying it during the F2P weekend, I don't really understand why it got so much hate (yeah, it might not be worth 60â¬ or 40â¬ but for sub-25â¬ it's decent). I didn't experience any technical issue (aka crash to desktop, low FPS etc.), graphics are really nice and I really enjoy the whole gameplay aspect. NB! I had Low FPS due to budget GPU (GTX 650 w/ 1GB), was like 20-50FPS(aver. 30-ish) with low settings on 768p. (Lol, I know but wanted to try out that game and I love these kind games nevertheless the 'repeativity')  If you love Far Cry(3) like games, you'll like Homefront: The Revolution.
1821	  Even for a free weekend i find it dissapointing.  Dull open world that manages to feel repetitive even after only 3 hours of gameplay. Its a shame about this franchise, could have been great.
1822	First the positives: The graphics are really up their; very beautiful game. The story is also a lot better and more immersive than the last game, so thats a huge plus. I really had a good experience playing this game.  As for the negatives: My game crashed about 3 times in about 20 hours of gameplay. Thats not as bad as some other reviewers had posted but it still annoyed me and it should be noted otherwise. The mechanics of the game could be better; it is annoying sometimes to figure out how to get into building that help rertake an area.  Another thing worth noting is that this game is really graphics intensive. My GTX 970 would get anywhere from 30 fps to 60 on High settings on a single 1080p monitor. This is pretty much the only game that I get that type of performance.  Overall all though, I enjoyed it; it was very fun. I reccomend it if you like the plot and general story behind the game. It is a good reboot of the last game and it is definetley the game the original title should have been.
1823	still needs a lot of work
1824	Well I recommend it for its gameplay. But for me it has a game bug so I can't go further in the campaign. Tryed to uinstall and install again. Google searched the problem, but nothing. So its a thumbs down from me.
1825	I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing love this game, it is mainly about territory which is so fun and that you have to hide and be stealthy about it just makes it even more exhilarating
1826	Bought the game even if the rating are low, gave the game a try. It's exactly the type of game I was searching for, Single-Player FPS.  However, the game keeps crashing at the same point. Save file doesn't load.
1827	wtf.. NOBODY playing coop.. :o SO THIS IS HOW BADLY OPTIMIZED THIS GAME IS ?  ALL SETTINGS MAXED OUT AT 1080P EXCEPT SHADOWS AT HIGH AND SSAA TURNED TO 1xAA (NORMAL) AND I GET ONLY ABOUT 40-50 FPS ON GTX970 OC, I7 3770K, 16 GB RAM SETUP.. WTF ??!! REALLY? and fps drops to as low as mid-30s when in combat with KPA.. dont have any idea how will it perform on a GTX 1080SLI set up! I would recommend just refunding this game lol !!!!! :D Its worse than even Arkham Knight at launch -_- ATLEAST ARKHAM KNIGHT HAD LIKE REALLY GOOD GAMEPLAY AND THIS?? LOL NOT EVEN CLOSE -_- JUST FORGET THIS GAME AND UNFROTUNATE BUYERS SIMPLY CLICK REFUND :)))))))))))))))))))))))))
1828	buggy game, died and just sat there for 5 min after selecting restart from checkpoint and nothing happened, quit to main menu and tried to load back into campaign and nothing happened, 3/10
1829	Played for about 40 minutes. 30 minutes to get the first gun and 31 to get the first crash. Game runs at 120fps + on my setup but crashed two times for no good reason. Also, the gameplay is a clusterâ¥â¥â¥â¥, i have no idea what I was supposed to do and the battles are so chaotic (in a bad manner, guerrila warfare is supposed to be chaotic). All in all, terrible, don't do this, not even for free.
1830	trash. they should just reopen Homefront 1 servers way better then this garbage.
1831	  Disclaimer: I received this for free on a free weekend. I played a couple hours of it, so in no way is it a full experience. With that aside, I very rarely actually dislike games. This is one of them and I'll explain why.  As a quick summary, this game is simply broken. I'll explain more later. The only pros so far: if you enjoy Far Cry 4's capturing of locations, you'll find this here, and the visuals are really great.   But otherwise: buggy, absurdly poor performance, poor scalability, mouse acceleration on with no way to turn it off besides configs, and other strange issues make it nigh unplayable. Whatever, I can fix some of that, ignore some of it, and try to play the game, right? Nope. The controls are very clunky and the psuedo-freerunning is also subject to many of the same bugs. I've gotten stuck on terrain so many times. Gunplay feels extremely awkward at best. The customization was something I was looking forward to, but after unlocking the battle rifle, AR, and LMG plus kitting them out nearly fully within an  HOUR  I realized there simply isn't much depth offered here.   The AI is so remarkably stupid that I've discovered a trick to defeat them nearly every time. They don't know how to shoot through surfaces below them. For example: industrial iron floor grids are things you can shoot through. I captured a couple points because they did not know how to shoot through it, while I easily picked them off. They get stuck on walls, in the ground, and I've seen a couple go to the default Jesus pose. It's VERY broken.   Until/if they ever fix this--this game feels pre-alpha and I am   not exaggerating when I say that  it's not worth any amount of money. I didn't even pay for the bandwidth and I still kind of regret downloading it.    I'd give it a 2/10, even considering the unfortunate circumstances of development. The fun just isn't really there. The only thing I can really say about it is that it's 'kind of' functional as a tech demo. 
1832	  Homefront: The Revolution is a mixed bag, but I think it ultimately prevails as an above average open world FPS. I played this game a good bit through its free weekend, and I enjoyed it. There's many reasons why its a mixed bag, so lets get to those reasons, shall we?   Positives
1833	I'm 13 hours in it. Playing on harder difficulty and still liberating the 2nd zone (I fully liberated the first zone, even after 100% H&amp;M.) These are my pros and cons so far.  PROS + Beautiful graphics and atmosphere. + Day &amp; night cycle + Cool guerilla warfare feeling. + Weapon modding on the go. + Plenty of weapons and bombs, each weapon has a three tier upgrade. + Pleanty of gear upgrades. + Co-op can be played alone and it still allows for progression (that's a plus for me as I don't have gaming friends).  __________________________________________________________   CONS - AI pathfinding quite glitchy. - Savegame is very unintuitive. It doesn't save when you destroy an armored car but it save after you buy a medkit. - Can be repetitive. - AI can act very dumb (F**ck the police, I'm going to hit this mailbox with a baseball bat!)  __________________________________________________________   NEUTRAL * Performance wise, I have a nice rig (i7 3770, 16GB RAM, GTX1080 FE) and the game runs at solid 60fps with everything on ultra at 1080p. I've heard it runs poorly on other systems, though. * Enemy AI it's a mixed bag.  __________________________________________________________   I think the game is worth it at $23 if you have a nice rig and like open world shooters. At full price... I don't know. Watch some let's play videos and see if you like it.   
1834	  Kill an enemy equipped with Assault Rifle. Magically, he drops an ammunition to your weapon (Garand).  10/10
1835	So far this has been an awesome game. I guess I missed all the bugs and issues because it works great. It's like a combination of This War of Mine and Metro except without the nuclear implications.
1836	Bought a Marksman rifle. getting ready to snipe. get a new addon for it. its now a rocket launcher. okay. sure.   I must say that this game is not the best game i have played. but it is entertaining and i find it fun to play.
1837	Didnt play this Game when it was released as my GTX 670 was having difficulty running it, i could run it if i turned all settings on low it was playable just. But i have a GTX 1070 and it runs much better now plus i believe its been updated and all in all a decent game i am 3/4 through the campaign and have enjoyed it so far Graphics are decent weapons are ok gameplay is ok the campaign is a decent length 32 levels i think and there are lots of side missions to keep you busy. Things can get pretty repetative though. AI is not so good can be pretty ridiculous at times. Its not a bad game but its also not great definitely worth it if you can pick it up in the sale. I dont think it deserves all the bad reports it gets now maybe when it was released but its a pretty solid game now and funt to play.
1838	Finished in just over 10hrs on the hardest difficulty. Run around from zone to zone, objectives are all the same. The whole turn your mk14 into a rocket launcher ideia is absurd. Lack of weapon variety when compared to the original. To sum it up in one word. Meh
1839	Ok, so I was struggling with a hard time of liking or hating this game. There are bugs that exist but I don't see too many, so let's subtract the bugs from my review.  The campaign: I have no choice but to get that Murcia' feeling when I play, but others might not like the story. From the beginning I was a little attached to it, I think the voice acting was pretty great, and there's a few clichÃ© parts but the voice acting from them still felt like they were into it. Though only thing I wish I could do would be to be able to play after the ending and be able to reset the strike points and so on and have the KPA attempt to retake them.  The weapons in the campaign are pretty diverse, and the only ones I hate are the shotgun and the flamethrower unlock. close quarters fighting is insane here because the AI rarely miss. I do wish there were more attachments and gear available. I also wish there was something I could do with KPA points after I unlocked everything, or that they just capped the amount you could earn overall.  Resistance mode:  I canât find anyone ever so I canât give my opinion on how it plays. 
1840	I love this game. I think its great. I can see why people are having issues running it though. I initially ran the game with maxed out settings but that got me about 30FPS. I fiddled with them a bit and have the game running a consistent 60FPS with mostly maxed settings but some turned to medium like shadows. The recommended spec is a gtx 760 and thats a joke. I have a Titan X and cant max it out.   Aside from the FPS problems, I think the game is awesome. I love the ambiance and setting. It feels like a first person perspective of Division. A combo of Far Cry and Dying Light. I wish more FPS shooters went the route of open world like this game did. I highly recommend this game if you can run it. I hope they patch the problems soon.
1841	Nice game, AMAZING GRAPHICS its looks like one of those concept art for games BUT THIS TIME IT REALLY LOOKS LIKE IT   GOOD JOB!
1842	Got this game on special for $24 usd, only reason i held off was I seen alot of negitive reviews... other than i few minor bugs like people walking in mid air, have experianced no problems. the story is great and ive spent like 12 hours just running around capturing everything and doing the bonus stuff very fun, It is kind of a different experiance than the first one. but i like it would rate.
1843	still needs a lot of work
1844	The game looks very nice, the atmosphere is great, I enjoy this kind of game. I love STALKER, Farcry 3, etc, so I know I could really dig this. If it ran. I get a CTD every time I try to play. I've tried many tweaks and changes to try to get it to work. I've tried the affinity fix, the multithreading fix (I don't have MT anyways), I've tried different cfg file edits. I do hope that someday I can play it, maybe then I can change my review.
1845	  Video recorded during the FREE WEEKEND!  The video below features 'first hand' gameplay experience of the game:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxJcUzrykuM   Game Details: HomefrontÂ®: The Revolution is an open-world first person shooter where you must lead the Resistance movement in guerrilla warfare against a superior military force.

1849	This is a very odd title. Imagine Crysis got a actually good sequel, before it escalated waaaay too fast and got the aliens and all that. They are on the island with North Korea in Crysis 1, and lets just imagine it ends with North Korea finding out about the attack and them invading America and winning. Boom, Homefront The Revolution right there but with less super suit. This really does feel like Crysis and how 2 should have played in terms of free roam in a city. Urban Guerrilla warfare for days. Keep in mind each part if a section but each sector is usually 400m-1000m with lots to find.   You are in an occupied Philly, part of the resistance tasked with miltant attacks to take your country back. The game itself is beautiful, since it is in CryEngine. There's moments I find myself staring at the ground while the rain falls watching the drops lets completely coat the road drop by drop until they turn into puddles and I get shot.   This game has a slight feel of what STALKER/Metro 2033 has, but really feels more like Crysis meets the Saboteur/Far Cry. I have really been enjoying the game, and would easily pay 20+. The game suffered from terrible publisher disorder and was released with a ton of bugs, I haven't had any real issues with the game, I did have a load error issue but that was due to a validation.  Tips for getting started. Turn off the music. Just do it. Set your FOV to something more tolerable and then finally remove the MipMap/Onscreenmap since that thing makes the game feel completely different with it enabled and by removing it forces you to take things slow since you don't have telekenetic abilites to see every enemy in real time.   AI is pretty good all things considered and is on point with flanking and covering. Gunplay is fun, finding out what bullets penetrate what is one of most fun things in the game. Lots of enviromental hazards and multiple types of ways to play. Supposedly there is a way to stealth, but I end up just running around shooting people through walls.   Shame the game had a rocky release, but excited to see new DLC's and support the developers on this. According to the developers, there are 2 more DLCs and the final one adding a massive new zone to operate in.   Tl;dr Like Crysis, Far Cry, Red Faction Guerrilla, &amp; The Saboteur? Buy it.
1850	Just bought the game, Just started the first area. It's alot like farcry. So far the story is ok, And the gameplay is fine. I don't understand why people gave it such bad reviews. IF you like farcry you WILL like this game.  Edit: Just finshed the game, It was good. I still can't understand why it got bad reviews??? Yes, the AI is not the best but it was still fun.
1851	Im a casual gamer, i played the first homefront and i liked it and this one is good aswell. the game style reminds me of shadow of mordor as in both games you capture outposts to expand your map and you have upgrades for your weapons. dont buy the freedom fighter pack just the base game when its on sale.
1852	the game out since May is still plagued with performance issues seven months in, what was supposed to be a great follow up to the first game is virtually unplayable
1853	  A stale, unfinished game. Honestly, I love the concept of playing as part of a guerrilla resistance, but this game follows the boring trends of all the other open world first person shooters. Clear out this base, it is now your base, get rewards, repeat. This repetitiveness on top of a generic story that tries too hard to make you care for a character two seconds before they die for dramatic emphasis and endless clipping, pop in, and other technical issues makes me not want to play this even for free.
1854	I was really excited when Homefront:the revolution was announced as an open world game. I didn't play the first game in the series more than a few hours for a plethora of reasons. I even waited when reviews were somewhat spotty at best on this game. This new itteration of the Homefront series has some good quirks and some bad. Let's start with the pros shall we? On the list of pros Homefront presents a somewhat large open world for you to bring freedom to. It seems to breathe, it seems to move and be legitimately animated. When I first started playing I was absorbed into the world and excited to explore it. The next pro would definitely be the weapons. Although there isn't a large variety to be had with this game, what it does let you have are a few archetypes that can be customized to your liking (pistol, shotgun, assault rifle, sniper rifle) and each of these weapons has a feeling that it is scrounged up and hastily put together for a fight with a better equipped enemy. There is also crafting of implements of destruction here as well, mostly just your run of the mill grenades, molotovs, mines... and then you also have a few cool rc bombs and drones at your disposal. I feel like these are the main things the game does really well. On the bad side however I will open up to a list of the cons. The game feels rushed , even with the patches out for it so far (6-7ish months after release). Framerat can stutter at times even on a higher end rig. There is also the problem of render distance for the ai. I've seen many times in game where enemy ai can just suddenly disappear, even while you are looking at them. As you can imagine this hinders players who like to use sniping as their main playstyle. This has even happened up close in many tight quarters firefights. Next up is the gunplay, now to me , the gunplay can seem very blocky and almost robotic feeling. It's nice to have interesting tools of the trade, but if they all feel very robotic or almost clunky to operate that takes away part of the fun of having them. One of the final cons I'm going to touch on is the fact that the ai is very poor. The enemy ai seems to be able to predict where you are at instantaniously and almost without warning at all. They also seem to be able to hit you as soon as you start engaging them, I have very rarely been missed by an ai ever in this game. The health system does little to nothing to help this as when you are playing on the hardest difficulty , if you get hit once you're already dead pretty much. That wouldn't be a big deal if the ai weren't all competition grade shooters. Anyways, if you are looking for a fix on an insurgant like game. I suggest you pick up a game like Red Faction Guerilla instead. I had such high hopes for this game and was disappointed by what I had actually recieved.
1855	Pros:  Open World makes you feel like you make a difference Gun modification Liberating areas  CONS: Storyline makes no sense Linear Last Level glitch/map error makes near unwinnable Repetetive   So.. Homefront The Revolution is a mixed bag which is why it deserves a 'mixed' review. I am going to be honest in saying that I probably like this game because of when I played the first one and how nostalgic it made me feel to play this game.  Unfortunately, it felt like they did a retcon so that everything you did in Homefront 1 didn't occur. Which sucks, it was fun helping the military and seeing them in action. The fact that NORTH KOREA could do all of this to the United States is perposterious. I know they changed it from China, but going with CHina would have made it feel more real.  The game play, Except for the last level, is solid and the game can be fun. The story makes no sense, and is barely logical. They create threads that they never finish - and some of the groups you see are stereotypes.   I did enjoy the radio chatter as you freed different districts.. It made it feel like a real revolution as the group became more and more organized, however.  Overall , It's a very mixed bag.. The game is work 30 bucks at the high end in my opinion - a solid buy at 20.. They're stealing money at 60, or even 40.
1856	Most slept on game of the decade, it's fall out for mixed with assassin's creed with a hint of fable esc story telling. I didn't buy it because of the reviews but got it on sale just for poops and giggles.... I hate single player games.... I didn't really like fall out 4... but this game, the universe, it really draws you in. I recommend it on sale, or with the money you got back from.no mans sky
1857	Game is unfinished, Full of bugs etc. etc. Waste of money. Enemies spawn behind of your back in corner you just cleared. You get stuck in objects. I dont normaly rage quit games, this one made me do it 3 times in same day.
1858	-Glitchy gameplay -Clunky game mechanics -Stupid AI -Boring music -Boring storyline I really wanted to enjoy this game and i tried hard to do that, but failed. So don't waste your money on this one. Buy it on a sale maybe if its super cheap.
1859	Easily could have been one of the best games i have ever played.  This game could use more optimization, but other than that its great.  Guerilla warfare was executed perfectly, played through the whole game on the hardest difficulty and you learn to really fear the enemy, Its great and i loved it, good job to the developers,  HOWEVER. The frame rate and computer optimization lacked severely. I was strongly disappointed by this, If you have a good computer, i recommend it. if you just make minimal req, i dont.
1860	Im a casual gamer, i played the first homefront and i liked it and this one is good aswell. the game style reminds me of shadow of mordor as in both games you capture outposts to expand your map and you have upgrades for your weapons. dont buy the freedom fighter pack just the base game when its on sale.
1861	Got shot tried to revive got shot again until 5 deaths I could move again to finish a simple strike point.
1862	It is free for the weekend so i try the game and it still is heavy on the machine and it got some minor bugs.. but for the 13 hours i played it plays like any other far cry game there is so its good for me, im gonna buy
1863	One of the most unstable games I have ever had the misfortune of wasting money on. After no more than 5 minutes of game play it crashes and im forced to restart my pc.  If I could get a refund i would.  UPDATE: Traced the issue back to the Graphics card (R9 380). I have now got it working (and it is a fun game now) but only after reseting my overclocks,wiping the drivers and game from the pc and then reinstalling the drivers and game.  If you have an AMD graphics card be ready for lot cursing and shouting
1864	Nice game, AMAZING GRAPHICS its looks like one of those concept art for games BUT THIS TIME IT REALLY LOOKS LIKE IT   GOOD JOB!
1865	Got this game on special for $24 usd, only reason i held off was I seen alot of negitive reviews... other than i few minor bugs like people walking in mid air, have experianced no problems. the story is great and ive spent like 12 hours just running around capturing everything and doing the bonus stuff very fun, It is kind of a different experiance than the first one. but i like it would rate.
1866	still needs a lot of work
1867	The game looks very nice, the atmosphere is great, I enjoy this kind of game. I love STALKER, Farcry 3, etc, so I know I could really dig this. If it ran. I get a CTD every time I try to play. I've tried many tweaks and changes to try to get it to work. I've tried the affinity fix, the multithreading fix (I don't have MT anyways), I've tried different cfg file edits. I do hope that someday I can play it, maybe then I can change my review.
1868	  Video recorded during the FREE WEEKEND!  The video below features 'first hand' gameplay experience of the game:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxJcUzrykuM   Game Details: HomefrontÂ®: The Revolution is an open-world first person shooter where you must lead the Resistance movement in guerrilla warfare against a superior military force.
1869	This is a very odd title. Imagine Crysis got a actually good sequel, before it escalated waaaay too fast and got the aliens and all that. They are on the island with North Korea in Crysis 1, and lets just imagine it ends with North Korea finding out about the attack and them invading America and winning. Boom, Homefront The Revolution right there but with less super suit. This really does feel like Crysis and how 2 should have played in terms of free roam in a city. Urban Guerrilla warfare for days. Keep in mind each part if a section but each sector is usually 400m-1000m with lots to find.   You are in an occupied Philly, part of the resistance tasked with miltant attacks to take your country back. The game itself is beautiful, since it is in CryEngine. There's moments I find myself staring at the ground while the rain falls watching the drops lets completely coat the road drop by drop until they turn into puddles and I get shot.   This game has a slight feel of what STALKER/Metro 2033 has, but really feels more like Crysis meets the Saboteur/Far Cry. I have really been enjoying the game, and would easily pay 20+. The game suffered from terrible publisher disorder and was released with a ton of bugs, I haven't had any real issues with the game, I did have a load error issue but that was due to a validation.  Tips for getting started. Turn off the music. Just do it. Set your FOV to something more tolerable and then finally remove the MipMap/Onscreenmap since that thing makes the game feel completely different with it enabled and by removing it forces you to take things slow since you don't have telekenetic abilites to see every enemy in real time.   AI is pretty good all things considered and is on point with flanking and covering. Gunplay is fun, finding out what bullets penetrate what is one of most fun things in the game. Lots of enviromental hazards and multiple types of ways to play. Supposedly there is a way to stealth, but I end up just running around shooting people through walls.   Shame the game had a rocky release, but excited to see new DLC's and support the developers on this. According to the developers, there are 2 more DLCs and the final one adding a massive new zone to operate in.   Tl;dr Like Crysis, Far Cry, Red Faction Guerrilla, &amp; The Saboteur? Buy it.
1870	its ok, a bit laggy but i bought half price at amazon on disc! So buy on sale or after next patch!
1871	  A stale, unfinished game. Honestly, I love the concept of playing as part of a guerrilla resistance, but this game follows the boring trends of all the other open world first person shooters. Clear out this base, it is now your base, get rewards, repeat. This repetitiveness on top of a generic story that tries too hard to make you care for a character two seconds before they die for dramatic emphasis and endless clipping, pop in, and other technical issues makes me not want to play this even for free.
1872	  FREE WEEKEND TRIAL  Positives: -Visuals  Negatives: -Shallow characters -Mute hero -Firearms lack 'oomph' -Marksman like enemies -Liberating gets very old very fast -Horrible AI -Bugs 
1873	This is a very odd title. Imagine Crysis got a actually good sequel, before it escalated waaaay too fast and got the aliens and all that.

1874	The game itself is quite interesting and has the potential to be fun. after some time testing out graphics and such, the game has a constant low fps. even on the lowest graphics that the game could achieve it still lags and the frames freeze. fun game but bad optimization.
1875	just... *sigh* just buy this game in a sale. dont pay 60 â¬/$ for this.
1876	Loving the game so far was waiting till I could afford it but now i cna play it for 2 days. I like the gun paly in the game and the fact its an open world game where you can explore pretty much anywhere and I was a big fan of the one that was released in 2011
1877	The amount of time says how entertaining this game was
1878	It's....just terrible ;-(
1879	Great game, single player lasted me 34hrs so I got my moneys worth ran great in SLI using the Crysis 3 compatibility bits (Not the Nvidia profile or the rise sone of roam profile).  Very enjoyable game play with a half descent story.  Multiplayer has been a great let down still cant even play due to the game not letting me rebind my keys. 
1880	This game is basically Dying Light but instead of zombies you're killing Koreans  Even though it gets repetitive and there's stuttering on a machine that really should have no performance problems (plus the near criminal lack of multiplayer when the first Homefront's MP was what carried it), there's something fairly satisfying each time you knife a Korean sniper
1881	First, I would like to say that I think all the hate for this game is a bit misplaced. To many reviewers base their reviews solely on how well the game runs. I think that it is an important factor yes, but people should review on content as well.   Does the game stutter, or suffer from graphical problems. Yes. Slightly. I am used to running Fallout, skyrim, MGS:TPP, Killing Floor 2, Elite Dangerous, basically everything I own on high or max settings with 60fps. Currently I am running about 47-50fps on the 'High' settings. There was some tearing and choppiness, but turning on V-sync helps.   There are complaints about lip syncing being bad. My answer to that is, 'Have you played any video game, ever?' I don't think I have ever seen a game with perfect lip sync, or even what I would call great. Mouths are hard to animate. Get over it. If you really care so much about lip syncing, that that kills the game for you, you need to lighten your standards.   Now, IN TERMS OF ACTUAL GAME PLAY AND CONTENT!!! I would say this is definitely worth a purchase. Try it. I found the whole Koreans invading the US a bit Red-Dawn esque, but if you can get by it, the story is not half bad. I am only in about an hour or so, but everything has been pretty solid so far.   MOVEMENT/GUNPLAY: Movement handles pretty much how you would expect from a CryEngine game. It can be a bit blocky. Yes, your character moves slow, but what you have to realize is that this isnt Halo or COD where you just run around and shoot people in turbo mode. You are outnumbered, outgunned, and outclassed in about every way, so moving slow is essential to make sure you dont run smack into a patrol and die. The gunplay is crisp and rewarding, and it feels good when your bullets find their mark. I think people have gotten too used to being super soldiers, and expect too much flashy gunplay. While it doesn't suffer the 'cap gun' feel of COD and some other games, the gun sounds could use more 'oomph' to them.   AI: While I have only had about an hour to examine the AI, I will say that I have been more impressed with other games, but that being said, I have definitely seen much worse AI, in more popular games. Have the people complaining about the AI ever played a Bethesda game, like ever??? The enemy AI seems pretty keen, and I have deliberately fired shots just to see how well their 'search' mechanic feels, and I think it is pretty good. You definitely feel like you are being searched for, rather than the AI just going through the motions.   Is it worth 60 bucks? I think so. To the rapid-fire, ADD-like, spastic pewdiepie generation, it might bee too slow for you. I am playing on the normal difficulty, and I have died several times in firefights, but never have I felt cheated or gypped. You will die after being shot a few times. Welcome to real life pal. No BS overshields, no health regen that babies you. Preparation and thoughtful execution of your objectives will give you satisfying payoffs and make you feel like you really worked to liberate that stronghold, or find those supplies.   TL:DR Bottom line; Don't let the negative hype decide for you. Buy it, put an hour into it, and decide for yourself. You can always refund.
1882	So far I really like this game. The gameplay is fun. It's story is more engaging than FarCry. My CPU is a 4 year old AMD teamed with an nvidia gtx 970 running Windows 10 at 4k resolution and I have yet to experience any bugs or slowdowns. Performance is good and the game looks pretty.
1883	  This game suck   IT WON'T LET ME LAUNCH THE GAME  IT SAYS press enter to begin   I KEEP SPAMMING ENTER NOTING HAPPENED  PLEASE TELL ME
1884	Not as bad of a game as people have been saying. I think people set the bar too high.   Positives:  Story line is excellent The world is belivable and fun to explore and loot The graphics in this game KICK â¥â¥â¥ (Not the best out there but pretty good)  Negatives: LAckluster framerates at times.  Glitches  But what game HASN'T been shipped with those problems?  With a few patches overtime, most if not all of these bugs will be fixed, so I'm not even fronting about that.
1885	  Bouncing Bombs Rarely Hit Target During WW2
1886	Amazing game. The developer is really supportive and transparent about fixes to its customers.I have not completed it yet but, I have really enjoyed this game. I think it is a awesome story with some really cool concepts on the future of America in captivity. This is a perfect sequel to the original Homefront by THQ. Some things that would be awesome. 1. 30 fps lock built in 2. If the screen on the phone was a little bit easier to see, slightly more seamless from map to other settings and back to game play. 3. The recoil on the guns needs to be scaled back slightly. Without auto aiming enabled its a struggle to hit your targets. Other than that it is on the top shelf of my library.
1887	CAUSE OF LOW PERFORMANCE IS: WINDOWS 8 AND WINDOWS 10 Users with weaker systems but Windows 7 have higher performance than High end systems using any version of Windows that is higher than Win 7....There you go. That's the culprit...If your windows version is higher than Windows 7 ...you're gonna have problems. Devs need to work on optimization for Windows 8 and Windows 10    If not, this is the cause: 'Don't see what the problem is... I'm running it with a stock GTX 970 at 2103x1314 (Nvidia DSR). Performance is 50+ FPS in combat and stable. I don't see what all the crying is about. Probably the same thing as always. People blindly turn all the graphic settings to the max like idiots. Keep in mind that , just like any game, some graphical settings make absolutely no difference in visuals but reduce FPS immensly and more importantly, also keep in mind that some settings not only reduce your FPS by a lot, they also downgrade the visuals. Settings like post processing for example that just make everything look blurry and remove 20 FPS from your performance. You can have the game look amazing and run great with the right settings..... Max Graphical settings does not equal max visual quality...as I said. Turning up / enabling certain settings will reduce visual quality ( and FPS) in this game just like any other game.... NOOB: ' OH, if I want the game to look as good as possible, I have to turn up the settings to the max' Nope, that's a fallacy.   As for gameplay it's an enjoyable game. I think that people are having their experience ruined and calling this game trash because of their poor performance that they cause because they don't know what each setting really does and blindly try to turn everything to the max like idiots..'
1888	32 gb ram, 2x Nvidia GeForce GTX 780M and running the game in low. My FPS is 20~25 ... WDF?
1889	My personal opinion is that i like this game, at the beginning it didn't seem very exciting and i have to admit it got a little bit boring but from halfway throughout the story i enjoyed it.  Ingame there are very cool options like transforming your assault rifle into an LMG, your pistol into a submachinegun, etc. Driving is not that bad but it's not the greatest, map is big but objectives and missions aren't very far and the max. time that you'll need to 'run' to them is probably 2 minutes.   Other than that graphics are fantastic and story can be nice and immersive if you pay attention to notes and other random stuff that you get by exploring.  Performance is not great, with my setup i have huge fps gaps that go from 110 to 30 but NEVER under 30. I thought about it and i recommend it.  Until half story i would give 5/10 From halfway to the end and even after 7/10
1890	For 18$, this game is quite ok. At least faaaar better than Umbrella Corps...
1891	Dont listen to the bad reviews,This game is awsome!.  Yes there are some small glitches as with any new title with this much open world.  Having a blast playing and going almost anywere I want in a huge city.  The detail and AI are great.  Check it out :)
1892	After putting some good time into this game I can say that the thing is playable.. but there is so many problems with it. I hope it gets some good patches, it could be fun. It feels like it's release was rushed because there is some ugly looking graphical errors and glitches in the game. And they're very obvious, say goodbye to your immersion!
1893	Not ready for release yet
1894	waste of time-just bad 
1895	Poor gameplay. Poor graphics. I have just played it for 90 minutes and become extremely bored. Not sure that I will return for another session. What a waste of my hard earned cash.
1896	cant see what people are moaning about. Those that say their 'high end' computer has trouble running this, i doubt their computer is'nt as 'high end' as they think it is. But basically i really like this game. nuff said.
1897	Development hell do I need to say more?  Pros- Graphics are good Great idea  Cool on the move gun modification voice acting is ok?  Cons- Story is boring  They just throw you into the open game expecting you to just find it all out on your own Animations are â¥â¥â¥â¥  Gun play is â¥â¥â¥â¥ Ai is â¥â¥â¥â¥ Theres not alot of diffrent voice lines so alot of npc repeates the same lines over and over again   This is another case of development hell a good idea moved from developer to developer that eventualy just got released when it should have been worked on for another solid year.
1898	!!!!!DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!  The story is okay, but everything else is terrible. The gunplay is janky as hell, the movement controls are terrible, it's super glitchy, and it doesn't run very well.  If you do buy do not pay full price.
1899	Dont listen to the bad reviews,This game is awsome!.  Yes there are some small glitches as with any new title with this much open world.  Having a blast playing and going almost anywere I want in a huge city.  The detail and AI are great.  Check it out :)
1900	The 9FPS simulator 2016. Recommended!
1901	this game is 10/10 crap,dont wast ur money on it.
1902	To be honest at the beggining I didn't like the game ('At the beggining' I mean when game has its first trailer). My friend showed me that game, and for me it was kinda boring shooter with boring story etc. Now, I look forward to play the first Homefront game. But let's get back to Homefront: The Revolution. For me this game has great actors, I was able to feel their desire for revolution and making US again independent, I was able to hear this in their voices. Story is great for me, it's not perfect but is great. Characters are well-written, I really liked their character and how they act (Especially Dana). Gameplay, I'm kinda sad because there weren't any stealth options only when the quest (I think we can call it the quest) was telling you to be quiet and stealthy, I couldn't approach that part of story without getting detected or I didn't see that opportunity, well if I am wrong then sorry, what more we had points to capture and capturing those was hell a lot of fun ! Some were tricky and game forced you to actually think how to get the certain area.  I think that's all I can say.  I'd like to give this game 9/10 because it's sometimes repetitive and buggy, but c'mon there's no a perfect game.
1903	Buggy piece of crap. Do NOT support this company's screw up by buying this game
1904	  Just flat out bad. Nothing here feels smooth, and is in every aspect outdone by FarCry3, which came out several years before this. Shooting is clunky with direct on headshots flat out failing to kill basic enemies.
1905	I'm a huge fan of this genre and was really looking forward to this game since the latest Far Cry was so far from the norm. However, even after the latest patch there are too many issues remaining. The problem is that you can patch in efficiency and remove bugs. It's a lot harder to get rid of fundamental concepts. I don't feel like I'm playing a Freedom Fighter Fantasy, because it is way too easy to die, and there is very little you can do to get better gear that will prevent that. It's not a stealth action game either, it has basic don't go where it's obvious that you shouldn't unless you want a very lopsided fight. And it's not a Live, Die, Repeat game (though you do that a lot), since randomized patrols mean that you cannot plot the perfect course to avoid detection and kill everyone ala Tom Cruise.  :(
1906	I got refunded for this game.   Pros
1907	Since my original review, this game has had several updates but still the performance remains below standards.   I would not recommend this game until the devs do something about the poor performance.
1908	In all seriousness, the developers ruined this game..... I rather play a game where the screen are just black and white wavelengths, and the goal of the game is not to play Homefront.
1909	I decided to buy the game after 2.0 performance patch. Runs great on my rig (gtx 980) everything maxed out. Graphics are top notch, facial animations better than Deus Ex Mankind Divided. Story seems fine and gameplay is fun. I recommand this game to everyone who loved Far Cry series or Crysis. Vote: 8/10
1910	It was ok, not mind-blowing.
1911	Homefront has all the right ideas, a story, large open world, different mechanics it all seems good. However the execution of these ideas leads to one of the worst games ive play while having the ideas I love. Its story falls short on importance, its open world suffers from buggy gameplay with far to few weapons and equipment. The A.I are a joke, friends cant hit anything and enemies kill you with no real notification that you are being shot. It reall is a shame considering how cool the games ideas are. Taking back a city from occupying DRNK forces block by block. With all these issues the multiplayer also has some great ideas, of outfitting a soldier and upgrading their gear and equipment how you see fit. With a backstory that acts like a perk, i can understand the direction. Again its poor execution, long load times, limited amounts of missions, and barely anyone to play with. Good try Deepsilver good try.
1912	I don't know what it is with this game, but between the aiming, interface, story, voice acting, and the lack of optimization I just couldn't enjoy this game. I played about 30 minutes and then sent in a refund request. I was hoping this would be something like the Metro series, but in a different universe; Sadly, it was just a script written by a bunch of high school interns.....................
1913	It was ok, not mind-blowing.
1914	Good but the real problem with it now is that there is not enough guns. Please add AK47 and more variants.
1915	ummmmm i liked the 1st homefront but this 1 is just awful not even worth 3.7 $ that i paid for it :/
1916	I didn't listen to the steam reviews and I regret it. This game is complete dog â¥â¥â¥â¥. Please pay attention to the steam reviews for your own safety.
1917	My Video Is a Review in Progress Enjoy!!!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bDSsfzaDHM 
1918	Game is buggy as hell and the AI mechanics are really done badly. Controls seem very clunky and the level design not so great. Would not recommend. 3/10
1919	  why the hell I always see my cursor during gameplay ? is this some kind of bug or what ?
1920	  Nice game
1921	â¥â¥â¥â¥ game.  Loved the first one for the MP, but this one suffers from some perverted porting.  Controls are â¥â¥â¥â¥ and makes a nice lloking game turn into a hate filled â¥â¥â¥â¥-fest.  Wait until this is free, or just pirate it. â¥â¥â¥â¥ the developers on this one. Bunch of Koch heads looking to cash in on IP.
1922	Performance still sucks!  Settings, VERY HIGH with SUPER SAMP OFF  i5-4690K @ 3.5GHz / 16GB DDR3 2133MHz / GTX 970 4GB. At 1920x1080 Resolution (1080p) the game plays around 30 - 40 FPS. Now if I bumb down resoltion to 1280x720 (720p) I get 50 - 60 FPS.  Dambuster, I know you guys have struggled in the past and being a 'new' studio, this release isn't helping your reputation.   I don't understand what's wrong, this game is on CRYENGINE, not CRYENGINE 3 but the very first CRYENGINE, optimization should be super simple by now. That, or develop the game on UE4. 4/10. 2016 AAA Developer can't optimize a AAA title. :(
1923	good game i prefer to you i getting 30+ fps on gtx 750ti.
1924	  Tried it on a free weekend and surprisingly i enjoyed the campaign. Multiplayer lobby was always empty. I guess no body is playing this anymore. I will buy it once its %50-75 off.
1925	Daina..... or however youd like to say her name, i could not play this game fore more then 20 minuets, because once i saw her character model, I Alt-f4'd and imidiatly began to vomit, what the actual h e double hockey sticks deep silver, no more.
1926	Though it is better than the first it does not mean it is good. Playing the game for only 30mins I had already encountered several bugs and crashes ... not only that I dont want to sit and watch cutscenes for the entire time
1927	â¥â¥â¥â¥ game.  Loved the first one for the MP, but this one suffers from some perverted porting.  Controls are â¥â¥â¥â¥ and makes a nice lloking game turn into a hate filled â¥â¥â¥â¥-fest.  Wait until this is free, or just pirate it. â¥â¥â¥â¥ the developers on this one.

1928	41GB of meh. Thanks god it's free weekend.
1929	Dont. Waste. Your. Money.  Dialogue sound doesnt work. ALL Other sounds work just fine. I have no sound problems with ANY other game. Just dialogue - and just this game.  Spent five minutes waiting for a save point, so I could save and then troubleshoot the issue. No dice. For five minutes, you're watching the game, not playing it. Yep: Unskippable cutscenes. As if anyone gives a crap about your garbage video game story. WE WANT TO PLAY the game, NOT watch it.  Sure, I barely spent any time with it. But what I did spend, was with a non functional game featuring beginner level design mistakes - lack of surround sound support (in 2016, really) and unskippable, watch-not-play segments.  No thanks.
1930	  Played on the free weekend, so it didn't cost me anything.  Spent a few hours playing the coop mode with a friend. Very repetitive 'kill these people, then install a virus which takes 5minutes, then escape'. Heavily reliant on 'get money and xp, make self better, play again on harder mode, or buy upgrades with real money'. So that was a bit naff.  Tried the single player campaign for a few hours, and that was actually quite fun. Open world, choose which objective to do next. But the AI is pretty dense and the scenery is quite boring. After the first area I was put into a 'be sneaky zone', which really didn't translate well in this game.  The Enemies have a habit of just appearing behind you which not only destroys any immersion you had but makes any form of tactics a bit of a nightmare.  All in all, I didn't pay for it so it's alright if you need a distraction, but don't pay for it
1931	For players: I loved the gameplay videos so i was excited when i saw 'free weekend'.  My excitement died after i launched the game. Video setting was not saving itself and i spent like 30mins to find out why - no success. Lets try on high setting then - my laptop is not superior but game ran pretty well even on high settings. First 30 minutes were pretty good (FPS low but nah, who cares). After my hope was partially restored, last nail to the coffin appered - after i got beaten by two unknown guys, loading screen appears, game frozen and crashed. OK, maybe bug... lets try it again: Bang, another â¥â¥â¥â¥ appeared. Load save was 5 minutes od because, you know, checkpoint save system(what a stupidity). So, i did all again and... yes... it happened again. For demo/beta its a pretty good game. For 40â¬ product... you kidding me? Waste of money. Its for free and i cant even play it (at least without wasting hours to googling solutions to bugs). Wasted 40â¬ and 40GB. First impression is good, game looks nice. But with all the bugs and glitches, i understand why ratings are so low... i would rather buy far cry 3 for me (and for my brother... and for my best friend... and for another random person) than buying this wannabe game for 40â¬.  For developers: Look, next time dont waste money on Denuvo - people wont be stealing this crap. Trust me, its free weekend and i am uninstaling this 30 hours before it end. This 'product' is not even worth the stealing...
1932	  Not a good game at all. Would be a real drop from grace if it's really made by ex Timesplitters people. Really interesting story buy not exucuted well enough to keep me playing the game. The lighting is great in the game, but the shooting and enemy A.I feels really sloppy.
1933	It's an ok game.
1934	Performance is still hit or miss currently. Gameplay is fun.
1935	Cool
1936	I recommend this game, its fun. The main and side missions are fun. The story and cutscenes are good. The gameplay is great. The lvl design is good, the bad part is: buildings. Buildings are used like copy paste, the good part about it is: A bigger part of the world is open. Secret stashes are better, not copy paste. Areas are also great in not copy paste.  I have read that, alot of users think the voice is bad in this game. Me i think its alright/quite good. As long its not like: All voices sounds like they are recorded in a cave, no worries on my part.  It's an open world without the rpg element, money and side missions is what u will use to get better weapons and items.
1937	Not a bad game by anymeans. sure optimization issues whoop de, in this day and age that happens with nearly every game. not gonna mention names (cough girgle spasm gasp) Battle field 3 (cough) had when released. either way, don't believe all the dumb reviews people give. those of us who grew up in the more golden era of gaming didn't care about graphics, or even the ammount of guns. it was content and story. and to risk sounding old as hell, albeit only being 28. was a great game, sure it has its rage induceing moments but its not ment to be a COD clone where you can plow through the damn opposition, take unrealistic wounds and push forward. your not even a soldier, your a average everyday joe trying to change a forign occupation. for those people who don't like it cuz of 'story' congrats at some point and time in history a nation has had to deal with forign occupation and tyranny. never the less, try the game if you don't like it. steam offers refunds for less then 2 hours of game play, I my self am gonna keep playing and with the next paycheck get the expansion pass. meanwhile i'ma reliberate philly again.
1938	Total Garbage . After 3 hours of gameplay and latest update game crashes to desktop. Cache is verified, drivers upto date. Latest performance patch F$%^ it up
1939	Very good game.
1940	Pretty much a weak Far Cry copy.
1941	I really didnt care for the first homefront, but Having a blast playing HF2. Sure its not perfect and there are a few bugs, but nothing that crashed or stopped me from having fun with the game. I'm not bothered by the overzelous nature of the story line because this is an alternate reality. Yes there is alot to be desired, but homefront offers a freedom fighter open world that lets you recruit soliders, capture bases, customize guns and Fight for survival and gives you the excitment of planning out your attack.  I really hope the developer sticks to their word and keeps patching and expanding on the world of homefront in this style, because you can consider me a fan.  
1942	I hate to downvote this game because I like it AND it is fun....until it â¥â¥â¥â¥ing crashes, freezes, loses sound or whatever â¥â¥â¥â¥ing bug you will encounter among the numerous ones.   The whole concept of the game, the settings, art direction, and idea of semi-open world built on advancing and controlling territories (goes well with the revolution theme) are very interesting; the game has a lot of potential. It just needs better quality control, more patches, more content and adjustments with its ideas and mission structure.
1943	Fun game, Not worth the asking price ($59), Bad Performance, Bugs and Glitches, do consider when the price drops down and if possible, 50% - 75% off.
1944	A good all round game, with similar mechanics to those found in Far Cry &amp; Dying Light. Yes, FPS is an issue if your trying to run this game on too higher settings, but drop them down a bit and the game still look as good, and plays well. One or two annoying glitches, but nothing reloading a previous save couldn't accomplish. This may have been a game which started off badly, but I feel its one of those games that in a little time, will live up to what it was mean to be.
1945	So, I bought this game in hopes that not only would I be able to play what looked like a decent story mode, but to also play multiplayer games. Every time I went to join a random match it never finds anything, and when I choose to open a server nobody ever joins. This game is a huge dissapointment to me, a huge waste of $59.99... If I were you I would not waste the money to buy this stupid game and get something better like Battleborn or something.
1946	Game is boring and poorly optimized, and after 10 hours of single player compaign I lose my savegame for absolutely no reason at all.
1947	this game i very like but 80% black on screen n blurr at the begining of part 1 ,, cannot play ??? very sad
1948	  man this game so sh.it
1949	So I will start with saying that overall I had fun with this game but I have to say it doesn't deserve 40E for what it is. Going deeper although I didn't have much time to play it on the free weekend, mainly going around the sandbox doing a few side missions and main mission and exploring around, I will summirize what felt positive and negetive to my point of view.  Positives: Great graphics Great weapon system (mods, gear etc) Big map Very nice sandbox ,very nice and detailed buildings etc AI i found it decent, overall left me with positive feel. Good realistic shooting.  Negatives: Not optimized at all, I had to lower a bit my settings (with a 970) to make sufferable framedrops (at explosions or hustles etc).I say I had a decent 45-50fps at lows. Riding a bike was the worst experience ever. Not clear paths/directions to some objectives. Really bad dialogs Overall story wasn't good either, very rough and unprepared. I mean for a draft it is ok but when you release a game at that high price point, NO.  My Verdict : 6,5/10 If they improve those frame drops and the price is on sale at ~15E I would buy it. The game is really beautiful especially on a 4k monitor would be just to admire scenes and wandering around on foot(avoid bikes at all cost :P ). Not that special game , not that bad either.
1950	Tried to like this garbage, really hard, but alas, it's just plain dull. This game is trying pretty hard to be a Far Cry, but it's just boring. Boring gunplay, dumb AI, gun customization is kind of ok (but no silencer on a rifle? Come on!!!), but still not very sutisfactory. Damn glitches and bug all over.... In Far cry there was a lot of repetative missions, but they felt right for some reason, here it's a routine, I had to push myself to do side quests... Boring characters, boring story, unfortunately. Was hoping it would be better...  BORING!!!! BORING!!!! BORING!!!!  Overall - DO NOT BUY, waste of your cash in my opinion.... Cheers
1951	Em , did play several co-cop missions, suddenly a bug, nothing does move anymore wtf.  Several times did have the mouse cursor on screen by shooting. You can unlocks several perks for coop, but can no reassign them. Even there you have by coop a lot of stuff to unlock like weapons and upgrades. Did crash by me so far 2 times in 7 hours.
1952	Bad game with lot of glitches and bugs
1953	  Feels like one of the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ f2p shooters. To be honest, I would rather play Warrock
1954	Basically, this game is Far Cry 3-4 in the urban setting NOW WITH LESS TOWERS HOO-FREAKING-RAY.  So, the AI sucks, optimization (Radeon R7 265, AMD FX-8320E) is kinda bad, there is lags and FPS problems, but for me personally it's not the biggest problem, as i am used to play games with â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ framerate. Occasionally game can hang up, but it happened two times and that's probably the 'hue hue i load wurllld'.  Equipment upgrades are, well, how to put it politely... There is none. Slightly less damage, slightly more medic syringes things and double money things capacity, that's it. Really. What? Stealth upgrades? Is there STEALTH in this game? I don't believe you.  To summarise, game crashed at the exact moment as i liberated another settl... I mean outpost. 2.5 hours of slow-paced gameplay and almost 100%-ed first level. It's not that exciting, although in some places you can practically spam your screenshot button. If you like new Far Cry games - this is for you. Also, get ready for VERY EXCITING storyline.
1955	no good to buy, is pirate yes
1956	Shoot once, gun keeps shooting. 10/10 bullets wasted.  That bug and the cursor sometimes remaining on screen after using the phone and enemies respawning very quickly within an area (like a drone command or such).  Has an almost early-access feel with the number of bugs and graphical glitches that I've encountered (slow texture loads in some places, lighting quirks, almost falling through the world a couple of times while climbing areas).  Has a very dumb AI.  Needs major work but is fairly fun.  Edit: So I play games with keyboard and mouse, but if the game has a vehicle I'll also use a control pad because better control over the vehicle. I don't know if the combined controls is a factor or the cause but sometimes when I shoot the weapon will continue shooting after I release the mouse.  Bugs are a massive issue, as is the initial tutorial - I was stuck at the initial part for 30 odd minutes before realising I could just walk past the NKs.  Shifting to a non-recommend because the bugs have worn down the level of fun.
1957	I've been enjoying this during the free weekend. I have a few issues with the game, and I'm not sure if I can justify the purchase right now, but I might pick it up in the next sale. The gunplay is okay, doing collectibles in the open world might get old fast, though.  Issues:  + When you die, you have to press Return to respawn. I'm probably one of the few people with a broken Return key, but I get by using my Numpad's Enter. Throughout the game wherever you're expected to hit return, you can press enter. Except for when you need to respawn. You can hit escape and load checkpoint, but I'm assuming respawning outside of a mission means less lost progress. Doesn't seem like it can be re-bound, either.  + Filling consumables. It seems like I need to buy them one at a time, and while you can just mash enter, it'd be nice to have a Fill or Fill All option.   I've not tried co-op, and I've not crashed at all.
1958	Free Weekend Review  I enjoyed it, the game runs almost at a constant 60fps on my computer. The world can be immersive if you give it the benifit of the doubt. (I was playing on the hard difficulty)  There are some drops in FPS, there are some minor bugs.  I am currently trying to fixed a bugged mission (finding schematics).  Honestly, this game is a 6.8/10 for me. I really like a lot of things about it, but it also has a lot of problems. I'll consider buying it later, but right now, I enjoyed my free trial.
1959	updated  after foundout about graphic glitch was related to my overclocked setting, i've lower the setting and the problem seems to go away. but occasionally hic-cup occur if you got 2GB card and use texture resolution at HIGH . recommend to set it to LOW. (gtx960 strix 2gb) others is medium with 1080p still looks cool.  as for the game i'd give it 7/10 , if Farcry 3 is a good cold beer, this one is like a watered down version of it with better graphics and particle effect.  i beat the game while free-weekend, and i'm looking forward to get it on winter sales. achievements to collect and coop mission to be play.   as much as i like the game even it is not a great game just mediocore one, but an annoying issue is graphic artifact and black screen. i'd recommend it but i do hope they fix it for good.  when you engage a firefight / sneaking into enemy base and suddenly and goes black and everything screw except map market isn't help. and i fall from roof top which can only access by a motocycle twice because of it.  
1960	As of September 2016, it's well playable well on GeForce 1070; I got 60 fps with maximum video settings. The story isn't too attracting, but it looks well and its FarCry-like gameplay is good, for the first hours at least. It's much more interesting video game than the predecessor.
1961	this game is good it have few flaws   pros  love the guns becase u can customize on fly gameplays is ok  Graphics are good open world :)  cons (290 tir-x amd card) but not optimized. yes even the fps (60-70 on high with 2x aa and fAA and some others) is ok to play but still have turn things down with HIGH setings (chopy fps !) is ai bit dumb  lot of bugs    im givein this 6/10   yes is it recommend yo get the game but only if your computer can run it but however the cost still too much but if you relly need it go a head and buy   yes i tested on the free weekend i know the fps is ok but still unoptimized NOTE: chopy fps etc
1962	I am, admittedly, not far at all into this game. However, after about half an hour of gameplay, I received an error message about not being able to load a shotgun animation and a ctd. I also witnessed NPCs falling through the floor and numerous cloth physics on characters bugging out causing their clothes to appear as if they were in a spastic thunderstorm.   I had a little red flag go off when I noticed that the screenshots used on all the DLC for this game are basically the same. Can't we be provided screenshots of what the DLC actually includes? Unfortunately, when you're a lazy developer or are half-heartedly supporting a game, these sorts of things fall through the cracks.  Also, the story about North Korea taking over the US via some technological backdoors just fails to strike anything resembling plausibility and I have a very hard time releasing my suspension of disbelief.   I really want to enjoy this game, but it hasn't been easy.
1963	*Disclamer* I do kinda spoil some stuff so if you don't want any spoilers dont read this *Disclamer*  I loved the first homefront and as soon as i saw this game a pre-ordered so i might be a little biased, but this game is really fun the only downside would be the glitched and less than optimal optimization. For example a glitch i keep getting is when i customize the AR15 varient rifle with a sight my iorn sights seem to pop of my gun and just float in mid-air wherever they where when i customized it. and the frames constanly hover around max 50, but i have a GTX 980. overall there are some problems but its still fun. now into the semi-spoiler part, The biggest issue i have with this game is the goliath is supposed to be a mega-tank somthing no resistance has taken out before. but when you go and take on the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing thing gets detroyed in two seconds by small arms fire. i get that you have to make it tough in order to be fun. but â¥â¥â¥â¥ dude why are we risking so much to take a tank that can be destroyed by small arms? this is rediculous. and we are supposedly using this to break into a huge heavly guarded area later? â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t that will never work if this thing is as weak as it is in this mission. other than that i love this game.
1964	no good to buy, is pirate yes
1965	PLAYED ON FREE WEEKEND.  This review has been made using my feedback from playing during the free weekend.  I am one of the few who actually enjoyed the first Homefront game made by THQ. However I'm not a fan of this one. Performance wise, I had a rather poor experience, I had numerous game crashes and freezes. The longest I went without one was about 15mins. The framerate was ok on ultra settings using a 1070 founders, but not as high as I anticipated. Otherwise the game visually does look pretty good.  However, my main issue is with the free mode style gameplay, after the first 10 minutes of interductory cutscenes/gameplay, the story completely fell apart for me. Instead of a group of resistance fighters, the game turns into a one man resistance, you single handedly taking on the whole occupation forces of the KPA. This ruined the story for me as at least the previous game had a sense of a group of people not just a single man, even with it's fixed mission based playthrough.   Another thing I wasn't keen on was the repetitive nature of getting to missions, the motorbike controls are far too poor to use and also wasn't very immersive just driving past an entire platoon of KPA, and running 200+ meters made me feel like I was playing ARMA at some points of the game.  However on a side note I do like the weapon customisation to a degree, the way in which a pistol can be made into an SMG, or a Marksman Rifle into a Sniper Rifle is an awesome idea expecially when done in the game, not in a menu. However, on the counterside, I would have wanted more customisation as It's rather lacking.   In comparison this review may be biased as I haven't played the whole game, and for a more in depth review for longer playtimes should be considered alongside this review. However I recommend this game, ONLY if you are really interested in the purchase and the franchise, and when the game is discounted as even I wouldn't buy this game for less than 50% or more of retail price. 
1966	This could be a good game in 2008, in 2016 it's a pathetic excuse for a AAA title.
1967	I've been enjoying this during the free weekend. I have a few issues with the game, and I'm not sure if I can justify the purchase right now, but I might pick it up in the next sale. The gunplay is okay, doing collectibles in the open world might get old fast, though.  Issues:  + When you die, you have to press Return to respawn.

1969	Well this is my first steam review because I feel that this game is worth reviewing in a good way. I've no idea why it is getting all the hatred. It has a lot of good elements.   Pros- Amazing Graphics. Gameplay is fun Open world Awesome Customisation. Story is decent so far. Awesome performance on my GTX 970 after the latest patch.  Cons- The AI is a little dumb. But it doesn't take away the fun element. Given the circumstances on how it was released, I would say they have done a pretty amazing job. Go ahead, it's definitely worth a shot!
1970	Not bad.. a bit confusing at first but only played it for about 2 hours.
1971	updated  after foundout about graphic glitch was related to my overclocked setting, i've lower the setting and the problem seems to go away. but occasionally hic-cup occur if you got 2GB card and use texture resolution at HIGH . recommend to set it to LOW. (gtx960 strix 2gb) others is medium with 1080p still looks cool.  as for the game i'd give it 7/10 , if Farcry 3 is a good cold beer, this one is like a watered down version of it with better graphics and particle effect.  i beat the game while free-weekend, and i'm looking forward to get it on winter sales. achievements to collect and coop mission to be play.   as much as i like the game even it is not a great game just mediocore one, but an annoying issue is graphic artifact and black screen. i'd recommend it but i do hope they fix it for good.  when you engage a firefight / sneaking into enemy base and suddenly and goes black and everything screw except map market isn't help. and i fall from roof top which can only access by a motocycle twice because of it.  
1972	As of September 2016, it's well playable well on GeForce 1070; I got 60 fps with maximum video settings. The story isn't too attracting, but it looks well and its FarCry-like gameplay is good, for the first hours at least. It's much more interesting video game than the predecessor.
1973	I don't really understand why people are hung up on the flaws on the game. There exists a few problems, sure. Such as the AI, the acting, the writing of the story (Pretty obvious turns and twists). Don't forget the performance bug, I had massive stuttering, which I fixed by going into the task manager -&gt; processes -&gt; homefront + right click -&gt; affinity to one core -&gt; the set the affinity again to all cores. This fixed the problem, but I had to do this every time i launched the game.  Not everyone would like this game, some weird controls (RC car and the hacking part) but I liked the setting and I think that for a game which I bought at a sale it gave me the enjoyment I wanted. It's a different kind of game, but if I am going to be honest, I liked this game more than Far Cry 4.   If you think that the game seems fun, then I recommend that you buy it on a sale and try it out.  Overall rating: 7/10
1974	Dana the annoying â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ die.100/10
1975	Homefront the Revolution was a good concept that was very poorly executed. The first thing I noticed was that the framerate never went above 50 (i have a GTX 970 and an i5 6600). ontop of this, the game felt rushed and repetative. The gameplay was basically shoot people, hack thing, do that again. The game feels to chaotic and confusing at points and kinda takes away from the expireince. I would definately not reccommend purchasing this duw to all of the factors stated above.
1976	If you have played any story centric FPS game. This is not for you. The missions in this game are pointless and sometimes feel why they are there. I would still prefer first installation of this game over this one. Though the first one was not a great game but it was enjoyable. This game is just boring. Not at all recommended
1977	I really wanted this game to work. Its issues are mainly the fact it is unplayable on older systems. My PC is from 2013 and it was nothing but a laggy judder mess. I had to stop playing once I got on a dirt bike. It worked more the teleportation on a VR game than a traditional game. I am super bummed about this too. I enjoyed the first game; I was really looking forward to it. Also the motion capture peopleâs movements are weird and break any kind of immersion.
1978	Beutifull graphics, story pretty average. Gameplay is great, both campaing and coop-resistance mode. There are few bugs, but they dont ruin whole expirence. Worth buying if on sale.
1979	Honestly not that bad of a game. The story, gunplay, customization and freedom that this game has is very good. It reminds me of Far Cry 4. The only downside I can see is poor optimization and for some people driving ceratin vehicles. Also, now it is on sale and will most likely be on the Steam Holiday Sale so it is fairly cheap.
1980	cons: -I question why they decided to scrap the first Homefront game's 'reunified Korea' backstory and go with a rewritten history that makes North Korea a technological and economical powerhouse by itself. -Didn't find much to hold my interest in the multiplayer. -The North Korean occupying forces are a faceless monolith and that makes them boring.  pros: -This game does an excellent job of making you feel like an underdog resistance fighter, storyline wise at least. Every success is followed by two setbacks, and everyone working with you is as much a liability as a help.  -The characters are flawed and realistic. -The North Korean occupying forces are a faceless monolith and that makes them intimidating.  SUPER PRO: -Timesplitters 2 story mode is hidden within the game.  Now if someone would just port the entirety of Timesplitters 2 multiplayer to PC with online capabilities.  Final verdict: I had fun and I enjoyed the story. That was good enough for me, since I got it cheap.
1981	I accept with what it is.
1982	  What the â¥â¥â¥â¥ did you just â¥â¥â¥â¥ing say about me, you little â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥? Iâll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and Iâve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and Iâm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my â¥â¥â¥â¥ing words. You think you can get away with saying that â¥â¥â¥â¥ to me over the Internet? Think again, â¥â¥â¥â¥er. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. Youâre â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and thatâs just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable â¥â¥â¥ off the face of the continent, you little â¥â¥â¥â¥. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little âcleverâ comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your â¥â¥â¥â¥ing tongue. But you couldnât, you didnât, and now youâre paying the price, you â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ idiot. I will â¥â¥â¥â¥ fury all over you and you will drown in it. Youâre â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dead, kiddo.
1983	Beutifull graphics, story pretty average. Gameplay is great, both campaing and coop-resistance mode. There are few bugs, but they dont ruin whole expirence. Worth buying if on sale.
1984	Some frustrating problems with AI and performance, but a huge world, great gunplay and a great story.
1985	  The game is great! I really appreciate the free weekend, thank you very much for this!
1986	The game runs horribly, even after a load of patches. I can't even get it to not drop below 30 FPS on occasion on all settings set to lowest. And my Specs are above recommended.  In addition, the game is a bugged out piece of crap, that softlocks more than any other game I ever played. For instance you can softlock an NPC you're supposed to follow, by running ahead of them far enough. They'll just freeze in place, no way of getting them unstuck. It's really easy to get that one, since outrunning NPCs is, as per usual in any FPS, totally easy cause you sprint faster than NPCs. The other softlocks I had were a wrongwarp after meeting the resistance in the underground, and jumping effectively out of bounds, behind a wall, with no way back.  That, combined with the really dumb AI and graphical glitches and physics glitches make this really not an enjoyable game. All in all, this is probably the worst AAA release of 2016, and I'm disappointed that they managed to fucÂ­Â­k up the sequel to a pretty good game that much.
1987	  Free game at weekend:D I finished it and delete it:D Much wow. Much fun.
1988	This game lacks any direction to maintain my interest.
1989	Okay, after i finish the Aftermath DLC i'll review it. I promise. But here's my rating.   8.5/10 ~I'll put this game in the Test of Time award nomination.
1990	The best port of Timesplitters 2 on PC.
1991	cons: -I question why they decided to scrap the first Homefront game's 'reunified Korea' backstory and go with a rewritten history that makes North Korea a technological and economical powerhouse by itself. -Didn't find much to hold my interest in the multiplayer. -The North Korean occupying forces are a faceless monolith and that makes them boring.  pros: -This game does an excellent job of making you feel like an underdog resistance fighter, storyline wise at least.

1993	If you have played any story centric FPS game. This is not for you. The missions in this game are pointless and sometimes feel why they are there. I would still prefer first installation of this game over this one. Though the first one was not a great game but it was enjoyable. This game is just boring. Not at all recommended
1994	Beutifull graphics, story pretty average. Gameplay is great, both campaing and coop-resistance mode. There are few bugs, but they dont ruin whole expirence. Worth buying if on sale.
1995	the first one was far better.........
1996	  From what ive played in the free weekend the game is good and it runs well. Most of the older reviews are from when the game crashed, ran poorly and just didnt work but it seems pretty stable now. Dont listen to the older reviews since they are irrelevant now
1997	  The game is great! I really appreciate the free weekend, thank you very much for this!
1998	It's a pity when I go online, I can't find any players. Also, the AI is truly awful and glitchy. But unlike most FPS's, you don't necessarily have to finish every goal. Sometimes, it's fun just to run around shooting North Koreans instead of going for the next flag. And if you don't want the next flag and you'd rather get on with the story, that's cool, too. You can always return to the previous area for a 'full complete' anyway.  So, yeah, the dev's had lofty goals, many of which are incomplete. But the world is so well-built and the atmosphere is just right and the controls work just as well with a controller as they do with a mouse... It's totally worth it, just not at full price. Get it on sale if you can.
1999	I bought this because I thought it was an RPG, but it's a COD style shooter. I died over and over, but discovered the difficulty settings and managed to play the whole story game in easy mode (58 hours). Now, for the first time in my life, I'm playing online FPS.  If you like hiding in dumpsters, and freaking out whenever you see red dots on your mini map, than this game is for you.
2000	i dont understand these mixed reviews, for the price and content it is a good game. Its basically a decent far cry clone with a different story based on a North korean invasion! In my opinion you cant have too much far cry :D
2001	I had higher hopes for this second installment.  TL;DR- Awkward controls, glitching and clipping issues throughout. Don't buy.  Pro:  Longer single player campaign than I thought it would have. A bit redundant at times, but enjoyable, mostly.  Cons:  It seems that there's a delay for everything you do- granted, it may only be 1/100 of a second, but you can feel it. Motorbikes are slow and oddly controlled. I ran everywhere unless I needed a bike for a jump or activation. The RC vehicles suffer from the same delayed controls. Throwing hackables is a joke. For some reason, you can throw a brick 50MPH across the load zone, but a hackbomb either clips through the world and sits there on your screen below the level for the rest of your load- or it flops 4 feet from you. Patriot launcher would be fun- if it was even moderately accurate for more than 20 feet.  Obvious previously posted clipping and seizure npcs aside.  Not recommended.
2002	So I've been following this game basically since it was announced and I have to say that I am thoroughly impressed. I dont see why a lot of people are whineing about clunky gameplay and all that other Sh*t when i just play a game to have fun. this game give you the feel of being a normal human. You WILL die easily and you have to play smart. There is no real health regen and the gunplay is balenced. To the people who say that the enemys are bullet spongy, GEE I WONDER IF ITS BECAUSE THEY ARE WEARING A FREAKIN EXO SUIT OF HIGH TECH BODY ARMOR. That and the fact that you have to use rebuildable guns and the enemy's have every possible thing that is top of the line. its no wonder that they are bullet spongy and hard to kill. You are the resistance, not master chief. Normal humans fighting against a impossible enemy where you are outmanned and outgunned in every possible way. I applaud this game for creating that environment as I have been looking for one like this for a very long time. Please ignore the people who want a very easy game with little to no challenge because they cant handle it. Get this game. I rate it 10/10.
2003	Day One Review:  â¢ After a plethora of cutscenes I was finally able to move about. To my inevitable disappointment, there was extreemely sluggish mouse movement. This comes as no surprise given that this is a port (Fairly common issue). There was apparent mouse smoothing and mouse acceleration; which I hate with a burning passion. I searched through the settings to see if I could disable it. Aparently it's incredibly difficult to provide PC players with the ability to disable these options. Since I was desperate to effectively aim I also searched through the game folder and could not find a config file of any sort.  â¢ I also experienced many texure issues. Not missing texures or anything like that, just textures protruding through other texures. I don't know if its my high standards or not, but I found the graghics to be pretty mediocre.  â¢ The optimization seems a bit bad considering wasn't getting a consistant framerate with a GTX 980 TI on ultra in 1920x1080 (I also have 16 gigs of ddr4 ram and a 4th gen intel core i7, 3.6, just in case you might think that was the issue.)   All in all, after a very short play-time, I experienced multiple bugs (which is inevitable for a AAA day one release) and I would wait a bit to buy the game. Unless the above issues don't bother you, you should have a smooth playing experience, if you can even run the game... I hope this helps.
2004	No lag for me on my end, however from the many people who have said they've experienced problems, I will agree to wait a few for patches to roll or or pick it up on a sale! I have had a fun time in my hour of playing, MUCH better than the first title and I like the idea of an open world Homefront setting. Hopefully the next few hours will be as fun and the storyline will grow (not expecting much tbh) , so as of now my review would be reccomened *after patches*
2005	I have been highly anticipating this game, reading every article and watching every interview. The game is finally released and the first 25 minutes is just cutscene (to be expected from any singleplayer game) then the first few minutes of gameplay are awesome. Ultra graphics settings and 60fps in a very rich enviroment full of people. I get out into the actual game and struggled to keep 45fps on a pretty nice rig. The 'open-world' aspect was bland and had no story to it at all. I got on a motorcycle and tried to drive it, but that didn't really work. The camera angle was always off and I would crash within seconds. Inside of this bland story-less game even on normal difficulty were hundreds of drones and soldiers that killed me pretty quick. It got to the point where I wondered why I was even torturing myself with this brutal terrible gameplay and 30 fps. I then realized that there is no point because there is no story. If the entire game was like the beginning part of the game it would have been amazing, but it wasn't. I refunded this game as quickly as a I could. Extremely disappointed.
2006	Final Verdict: If you have the cash or you are able to burn money....buy it  If not, get Doom and wait for this to either go on sale or have a price drop     ALL ISSUES ARE TECHNICAL. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT UP WITH THEM, WAIT FOR UPDATES  MAKE SURE YOU UPDATE YOUR DRIVERS OR THE GAME WILL RUN LIKE POO  So far, it's better than expected.... And before you get all mad cause there is tech issues and I am reccomending it, let's be clear here.   I got the game running pretty well now. This review is based ON GAMEPLAY ALONE. Yes 60 dollars is a lot and yes there is no excuse. But it's why I put the disclaimer at the top. If you can be ready to fix the game, then read this reccomendation, if not....don't buy it.  IT'S THAT SIMPLE   I am enjoying the little time I have in it so far, I suggest trying it!!! Reminds me of a lot of games that got mixed reviews that I actually loved.  Now here is the truth, I am waiting to refund on the sole purpose that I am not sure how Dambuster will improve the issues I bring to the table. The game is there, it's amazing at times, but the immersion killing and pre-2012 feel reminds me of another game that had a horrible release....Sleeping Dogs.  If after Day one...two...maybe three there is no patch from the devs. I am refunding until stuff gets fixed  For now here is a brief review.  +Farcry in the city +Customization +Loads of things to do +A huge world +Havent experienced any game breaking bugs like people claim to be having +Gunplay is amazing  -optimization issues -lip sync sucks -graphics kinda blow -AI sometimes block door ways -Cursor Bug if you alt-tab -AI is pretty dumb when it comes to path finding  --Will update review as times progresses--
2007	3 hours in and so far it's a really fun game. The visuals for a torn apart city are really good and I like the stealth elements. Deep Silver's involvment is definetly noticable, as this game has a lot of similarities with Dying Light. Just substitute hordes of zombies for well trained and armed korean soldiers and instead of having a lot of melee weapons, it's a ton of guns.  The customization part is really cool but I quickly found myself using specific guns and configurations, though side jobs force you out of that by requiring so many kills with a specific weapon.  Honestly, I was worried, given a lot of the initial bad reviews, and I don't think it's warranted. I can see where some people are having performance issues though, cause even on my i7/980ti rig there are some hick ups, but not during combat (whenever it autosave it pauses for a moment). Hopefully a few patches take care of those.  Have not tried the co-op yet.  TL:DR version - If you liked Dying Light and enjoy stuff like Red Dawn (old or new), this game is really entertaining.
2008	Homefront the 'revolution'  from a technical standpoint i didnt have the massive issues that have been reported, yet. the gameplay feels, how to say it, Bland it doesnt feel good to shoot even the takedowns dont have to much variation, the enemy AI is... existent.  And the story oh boy the story i dont even think it could be called that, you are basically going from one point to the other killing all the enemies and liberating an area, so much for 'Open world' But hey lets leave it at that, atleast the game came out after so much â¥â¥â¥â¥.   Just wait for the next steam sale and buy this for 25$ tops and never ever, ever make the mistake i did by preordering this steaming pile of something.
2009	I cant understand that the gaming market does have alot of multiplayer games but homefronts multiplaer was one of the better ones, and to release the game without this is just admitting defeat and calling yourself failures,   you can still save this game... there is till time... multiplayer will bring more people to this game...    or maybe you dont care about the game...   please listen to your community not your investers. This is a great franchise with alot of potential, listen to the fans and you can make this title alot better.   Dont do what you want, do what the fans want. multiplayer is huge right now but co-op for this type of title is weak. You guys either had one of two thoughts:  1. Muiltiplayer is too much work lets just release the game... or... 2. Co-op is massive right now, 'thats a great idea'. NOOOOOOO co-op is good but not for a title like this, if you do not implement multiplayer, then you fail to listen to your public.
2010	There were a few big surprises in store for me when I first started this game. The first surprise was that the FOV slider was terrible and only ranges from 40 to 65, and the highest you can go through configs seems to be 90. The second was that despite what I thought, this isn't actually Homefront 2.   The first Homefront was flawed, but interesting. It took a semi-plausible story of a unified Korea becoming a global power and invading the US, and while the game wasn't great the presentation was on-point, using a mix of out-of-context real news clips, fictional newspapers detailing the various fallings of the US infastructure during the invasion, and the use of real-world brands as stores and locations. There were moments where you were able to stop shooting and listen to civilians in their encampments, and most of the time they only had criticism to offer because of the KPA's retaliation efforts to the resistance, taking away the 'you're the hero' feeling that other shooters like Call of Duty tend to revel in. It all gave the game a uniquely realistic approach that I haven't seen in any other game. It was unfortunate that the main supporting character was an unlikeable dork and the gameplay was the bog standard CoD shooting, and so it was forgotten until now - or so I thought. Homefront: The Revolution actually seems to have forgotten the original entirely, and the backstory has been completely rewritten into a generic mess that depicts North Korea just kind of magically becoming the new Apple and even arming the entire US army before using a deactivator chip that they stole from Black Ops 2 to disable our military, and so it begins from there.  As you've probably seen from the other reviews, the game is fairly buggy. It doesn't always run well, and even when it does run well seemingly random things will eagerly tank your framerate, like looking at a burning car. The AI is terrible, and the only reason they have any chance of killing you is because they seem to respawn constantly. If you die, you reload at a checkpoint, but the ammo and medkits you used don't get restored, and I'm still not sure if it's a glitch or intentional. You'll no doubt run into various other bugs that I didn't, but suffice to say the game could use some work.  With that being said, if it does run, it's not bad, and that's the only reason I'm recommending it positively. It's essentially an offspring of modern Far Cry games, and with that you can pretty much tell what to expect - taking on outposts, stealth that doesn't always work, exploring for caches, equipment and upgrades, etc. There are other new features, like parts where you have to work in a particular city area to rally the public to fight against the KPA, but for the most part it plays it relatively safe, and I'm okay with that. The two weapon limit is used interestingly in that your character is apparently a gun wizard and can change guns into entirely different guns by swapping everything except the handle out on the fly, so your pistol is also an SMG and a pneumatic launcher while your assault rifle can be an LMG or a grenade launcher at any moment. There's also 2 full Timesplitters 2 levels in it for you to play, for those of you who are familiar with Free Radical's older games.  I'd recommend waiting on this game if you get it at all in case it doesn't run for you as well as it does for me, but it's all around pretty decent. The story still feels a bit rushed and anticlimactic just like the first game, but it's passable and doesn't detract from the entertainment. Even though the game plays it safe and ultimately still copies another game, they at least picked a good one to copy this time, and differentiated it enough to keep things from being stale. I'm sure for now there are better games you could get, but Homefront not-2 isn't a terrible choice either.
2011	Not as bad as some people think.
2012	I dont know why people dont like this game its a lot of fun to me. Oh well, I guess its not for everyone. Also, I saw comments about proformance and shuttering. I have an i7 4790k coupled with a Sapphire r9 290x and getting over 70fps while recording. Again I guess you cant make everyone happy with this type of game.
2013	So I was pretty excited for this game, but had mixed feelings. Turns out I should have listen to my gut. This game is a terrible mess. I have a few hours in now and all I do is run around and kill the infinite enemies that spawn randomly. I honestly don't think the develoupers of this game knew what 'Guerilla' warfare was. However I will give it credit in some places. So here goes my pros/cons list  Pros: -Driving around in the motorcycle is suprisinly smooth. -Weapon mods are cools to watch putting on/ taking off. -Melee kills are smooth and generally pretty good -You can knife kill vehicles by hitting then in the glowing yellow spot  Cons: -The AI is utterly stupid -No real benefit to actually attacking in a guerilla style -Graphics are very dated -Gunplay is pretty bland -Enemies have a magic ability to transfer your location to ALL enemies in the area -Feels like an arcade shooter that tried to be tactical 
2014	Playing through this game designers single player campaign for about twenty five hours (deathwish or hardest difficulty setting), here is a review from an individual that has played FPS and TPS for over a decade, as well as actually having played this game. The combat of this game is very strategic, visceral, and frenetic with fluid navigation (including parkouring) providing mobility and stealth options with quality graphics and a believable immersive experience utilizing Cryteks CryEngine. As this game went through about three iterations of game designers, the completed product is a testament to persistence and the ability of these game designers to bring cohesion to a game for release to the marketplace. The subgroup of areas or yellow and red zones provide the player with unique challenges and game play styles. The start of the game requires thought and some previous FPS experience, played through the first area for five hours with only the side arm. Those with negative comments of this game might not have either the patience or skill to play this type of game, intuitive strategies such as knowing when to fight or retreat is a valuable trait during game play, this is acquired as an individual moves through the game and combat encounters. Knowing trigger points as well as upgrading abilities and weapon upgrades is vital to enjoying the game. The importance of approaching this game with the perspective of just learning to survive, to become strong enough to competently engage in combat and overpower the enemy A.I. is very challenging and rewarding, as every victory brings you closer to turning the tide against the oppression of the occupying force. In game rise of the resistance as the player completes objectives empowers the player with a sense of actually affecting the game, characters, and story. The day night cycles are very well incorporated, with night scenes immersing the player in a desolate wasteland of a nearly recognizable civilization, the amount of detail is exceptional with some clever game design such as utilizing motorcycles for generating power within the game designed world to advance, searching for resistance stashes with vertical movement through city dwellings. Every component in game has a reason for its existence, this enhances the feeling that one is truly working as part of a resistant movement to regain ones liberty. Variety of locations design is remarkable with memorable landscapes and environmental design. Weapons utilities are various with unique modifications empowering the player with about fifteen unique weapons, each upgradable and customizable for specific scenarios, including the clever utilization of weapons delivery via Remote control vehicle. Gear upgrades are very valuable, acquired through looting environmental objects and disenfranchised enemy A.I.. Pacing is important for enjoying this game, as well as a sense of awareness of your surroundings, and understanding how to effectively implement the various strategy exploits that the game designers have designed into the game world. Such as the resistances schematics throughout the resistance strongholds describing these advantages over the occupying enemy force, that these NPC have lived through this enemy occupation, and mainly in game cut scenes, all this increases the sense of immersion with this game world. The ability to travel through the world with a motorcycle adds for some exhilarating experiences, or the option to recruit up to four comrades to fight through specific objectives is vital, as these recruits actually fight with you, where some games these crew are a distraction to absorb bullets. Everyone that enjoys a quality FPS gaming experience will find much to enjoy with this game. Thank You and much appreciation to these game designers and everyone that had the determination and perseverance to bring this game to the marketplace, Good Work.
2015	Not worth the full price.  AI Mapping is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥. No guns. Can't even pick up Koraen weapons. Story is flat and makes no sense At all, The orginal homefront made a hella lot more sense. Boring Far Cry like, Invade the castle bs.(At least far cry had guns. And fun ones) No Multiplayer(Wtf?, That was the best thing about Homefront 1 what a joke for a full price game to?) CooP is boring, as usual.  Just beat the game, Nothing was in it. Had everything almost at the start. Nothing left to do. I really wish i could get my money back i didn't know it was going to be This â¥â¥â¥â¥ign â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
2016	its crysis, with moddable on the fly weapons, decent animations and camera, and lots of motion blur and lens flare. I am running the game on a six year old laptop and on low settings, it runs fine.   has a story mode that has some call of duty style camera shake, but the story isn't â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. has multiplayer mode thats very crysis like.   its worth the money, in my opinion.
2017	really fun but youll need a pretty good pc to run it.
2018	It's basically like Far Cry 3-4. If you did not like those, or you are tired of the genre, well this game is not for you.  This game is fine, if again, you're ready to accept the fact that it's basically a clone of Far Cry 3-4.  Right now there is some issues with the performance and AI, but mostly with the performance. AI can behave strangely and impair your fun. Ex: allies by blocking the way in a corridor or moving you around when they take cover at the exact same spot as you. Ennemies could use an upgrade in AI as well (Ex; Lining up to get shot, failing to take cover or failing at dislodging you or allies out of cover, failling at flanking manoeuvres, target priorities)   Better AI would make the battles more coherent and cohesive. Improving the ennemies spawn system would also be great into that matter.  Performance is erratic even on a factory overclocked GTX 970. Expect severe frames drops and inconsistent FPS. Howerver it is not game breaking just really annoying.  These are things that can be fixed in time. The fate of this game will depend on the developper ability to improve it over time and to improve it fast.  Windows 10 Home x64 (fresh, clean install and optimized) i5 4690k (not overclocked) GALAX GeForce GTX 970 EXOC Black Edition (365.19 drivers) 16gb ram 500gb SSD (Samsung Evo 850)  Despite this I do recommend the game. It is up to you to decide if you should pay the full price for it as of right now.
2019	I've played this game for about three hours on medium setting and have only experienced a few glitches and latency problems. There are all these people here complaining how they have these good systems and the game is 'super glitchy'! I notice how none of them even metion checking their graphics drivers even though they can have a huge affect on gameplay quality. I updated my drivers the day before I installed the game and have only had a few, small problems. I honestly don't know why these people are so eager to give this game a bad rating, It came out only 3 days ago, of course there will be problems. No game is problem free right out of the box. I believe anyone expecting them to be is just setting the bar too high. 
2020	great graphic on my amd a8/gtx 960 budget pc .  35 fps on ultra  bugs...is the cod had any bug in the first few day ? loads  fun game good story just wait a bit if u dontlike the bugs.
2021	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-ZlGQJ4SiI    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43O11-59a54   The game is good, but next time if you want 60 euro for this you need to work more to do a good game. We want quality games not quantity games.  I can't recommend this game but I'll support you.   Pros:  + Far Cry Style + Cry Engine   Cons: - 20 May in Europe - Bad AI - Bugs (many bugs) - Bad optimized (on GTX 980) - Only Auto-Save - 60 euro | FFB 80 euro | EP 25 euro | Doesn't worth more than 30 euro.   Next time if you want a good AAA game, learn from rivalry. (Look at Doom)  Note: 5/10
2022	Homefront: The Revolution is an interesting game, and it does split the masses a little due to its hardware antics.  First things first, I can run the game fine, despite not having the latest hardware. It runs around 45-60fps on high @ 1440p, so I'm happy. It has Denuvo - so what? Far Cry Primal had it, TW Warhammer has it, again, doesn't really matter to me.  So, let's talk about the game. Visually, it is quite pretty, on occasion actually REALLY pretty, the CryEngine does a really good job displaying a grim, broken city, with amazing nights and reflections, okay looking explosions, but overall believable looking effects, rain, fire and smoke,   Music and sound wise, it is a bit bland, the background music is overall a bit forgettable (as it is quite repetitive), but some of the set pieces have a really nice background. Sounds are good, weapons sound good, explosions sound fantastic, and soldiers and civilians sound great and add a lot to the atmosphere.  Gameplay wise - I struggled a bit. There are many cool things you can do with regards to ambushes, distractions, a couple of free-running places and lots and lots of gunfire. However on occasion it feels a bit unbalanced, but I guess that comes with an 'open world' kind of feel of the areas you are operating in. Do I find it bad? No, but it could do with a bit of tightening up, if that makes sense (once you played some of the different objectives you'll know what I mean).  Now, story: This is sadly the weakest point of the game, mostly because it feels a bit weak by comparison to the setting. I played the original Homefront, and while the acting was hit-and-miss, it felt more connected and pushing you forward. From what I've played so far (and admittedly, I did not finish it yet), there are a few pieces that are fantastic and show what kind of (positive / negative) impact you do to the civilians by your guerilla actions, and there is one scene where I felt properly immersed (I'm not talking about the intro), so it does have its good bits.  Overall, it is a good game. It isn't a great game, but it isn't a bad game either. Considering what the game went through (publishers, starts, stops, developer changes, etc), it has its quirk and its own charme, some elements are done really well, others could have done with a bit more love, but it does feel like a worthy successor to Homefront (which I liked a lot back then). I can see myself getting my money's worth out of the single player campaign alone, and I imagine I will be enjoying some of the co-op elements for a while. Based on that, I recommend this game, I'm having a lot of fun with it, visually it is great, and I do want to finish it and try the co-op this weekend.
2023	I REALLY want to recommend this game, but this game does not want me to recommend it to you. This game has a bad case of Duke Nukem Forever, it is obvious that this was not a completed product but since it was move from one developer to another they felt the pressure to just get the game out on market.   I was looking forward to this game quite a bit, and it did not fail completely out of my personal return policy requirements, but I can not recommend it to other people in all fairness. If they can fix their broken crap I would happily change this review into a positive.   Right now though wait to buy this game. If they fix it great pick it up, if not you will save your money on a 85% finished product.   Full once over here  https://youtu.be/Ho936khEaaw 
2024	Random crashes with no patch in sight. Rip off. Waste of Money.
2025	this thing is not a game it is junk .
2026	Pretty fun game to pass the time. Not the best game and not the worst game i have ever played. Wait for a sale for around probably worth around $30 
2027	First off I will say that yes, there are some buggy issues with the game right now, but if you enjoy feeling like a stealthy bad-â¥â¥â¥ in anyway, this game is probably for you. Gameplay feels great and is pretty easy to immerse youself into the game. I am looking forward to the next couple patches to really solidify a fun resistance expereince.
2028	Game was fun. Take it for what it is, no need to put games on such high pedestals before they're even released. The gun play is clunky at times but the overall flow of the game was pretty decent. The story wasn't terrible even though some of the voice acting was hard to experience :P 8/10 good time waster try it out if its on sale
2029	  It seems they finally fixed this game, runs well and this is my type of gameplay. btw if you are stuck somewhere - just go on youtube... yeah 2016 you have to go on youtube to beat the game...
2030	There really should be two kinds of reviews - one for those who actually played the game, and one for those who didn't get to play it for any number of reasons. Of course you wouldn't recommend a game that doesn't work, but that unfair in the overall review percentage for those of us that actually played the game with ok framerate.  There's a number of techinal issues with this game, but so have a lot of games, and there's not (for me in any case) enough of them to ruin the game. The overall gameplay and visual style is really good, and if you like Far Cry 4 and Fallout 4, there's not really any good reason why you wouldn't like this as well (provided you can actually run the game).  The story is boring and uninteresting, but so were all the Far Cry games and I don't think the story is the point in this one. As good as no multiplayer game ever had a story, but since a story isn't expected, no one cares. This game is about looting for cash to upgrade and taking over bases and absorbing the post-apocalyptic landscape and atmosphere.  I see people dislike the game for being repetetive, but I can't really remember any open world game that wasn't. If you like what you're playing, repetetiveness isn't negative - you just want more of the game. If you don't like the game to begin with, then of course the repetetiveness is like walking though Hell.   The game really feels like a Fallout reskin of Far Cry 4 (with a dash of Dying Light), and that's more than good enough for me, even with the technical issues and silly AI.  The mixed reviews is really unfair, it's a good game if you take it for what it is - a postapocalyptic FPS shooter with some minor RPG in it. And it even has a coop mode with characters and levels (although I haven't gotten around to that yet). People tend to complain that the game is short. I'm well over 30 hours and I'm not finished yet, although I do everything there is to do. I also don't rush trough on easy. I recommend playing at Deathwish difficulty to make the game last and to have an actual challenge.  I'll leave you off with a 7/10 rusty nails and a warning: It's not really open world, it's just not linear; the levels are big and square instead of straight - that way you can choose your own entry points when taking out bases.
2031	I noticed a lot of negative reviews on here... Still purchased. I have a custom system I built of 2x 980 Ti Hybrids in SLI that are OC and a 4790k on water but stock @ 4 GHz. I'm running 1080p @ 144Hz and I have 32GB RAM. I'm running Nvidia driver version 365.19. I should also mention that my rig has been a labor of love that's been a rollout upgrade since 2014.  Turn off super-sampling and the stupid motion blur so you can play and drink without vomiting and I've had no issues. I ran into several issues with super-sampling and motion blur on but once that was kicked, the game is VERY enjoyable even though it needs to be tweaked. I can't honestly give this a bad review after seeing the graphics and the gameplay. Yes, there are some shortcuts taken that are obvious. However, this team spent a lot of time on this game and to me it shows. I've been able to play this maxed out (minus motion blur and super-sampling) on my 1080p @ 144Hz monitor no problem and even though the voice acting is bad according to some reviews, (BARF who cares) I like the game so far. Once into the game, it strikes me very much like Farcry 4 where you conquer territories (Philly) and upgrade weapons with the option of advancing the main mission at your leasure. I forgot to mention that the Korean voice actors seem spot on!   I'm honestly not trying to come off like a â¥â¥â¥â¥ when I say I have had no issues and I enjoy the game. I've been told that my specs make everything awesome but I assure you that is not the case on custom builds by people like me who know just enough to be dangerous to risk losing lots of money if I failed at the build. Been there, done that. Sometimes different manufacturers products hate eachother and you realize you made a bad decision...  Anyway, I am the honest and dissenting voice it seems and I like this game so far and at this point I would purchase it again. I have had no crashes, no graphics issues other than mentioned, and I love the game so far.  EDIT: Finished the game!! Noticed TONS of FPS issues in late game to the point where the game was not playable at ALL even on my high-end system. I closed the game enitrely and restarted but that didnt help. Only a complete reboot of my rig would allow me to continue at playable FPS. I suspect game data remains in the GRAM and RAM unless a reboot is performed or real-time data is poor and bogs down the system. I still recommend the game but wow did they waste all of that effort with extremely poor optimization. What a kick in the nuts to those hard workers... It's like building a skyscraper on a Jello foundation. Why? Just why? I also find it hard to believe that an employee did not bring up these CRUSHING PROFIT PERFORMANCE ISSUES before release. I know these issues were brought up at BETA from players but for some reason the decision was made to press on and ignore. Seriously, think of the money and accolaids that could have been had if you released a quality product instead of releasing pig vomit performance and play catch-up as you go... Also, a free upgrade of digital crap does not satisfy anybody if you CAN'T PLAY THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING GAME!!
2032	Even after the bugs being fixed. This game just is mostly mediocre. There is some nice details in some spots and the concept is cool. Just needed some more polish. If you can get it at like $20 I'd say it might be worth a buy.
2033	There really should be two kinds of reviews - one for those who actually played the game, and one for those who didn't get to play it for any number of reasons. Of course you wouldn't recommend a game that doesn't work, but that unfair in the overall review percentage for those of us that actually played the game with ok framerate.  There's a number of techinal issues with this game, but so have a lot of games, and there's not (for me in any case) enough of them to ruin the game. The overall gameplay and visual style is really good, and if you like Far Cry 4 and Fallout 4, there's not really any good reason why you wouldn't like this as well (provided you can actually run the game).  The story is boring and uninteresting, but so were all the Far Cry games and I don't think the story is the point in this one. As good as no multiplayer game ever had a story, but since a story isn't expected, no one cares. This game is about looting for cash to upgrade and taking over bases and absorbing the post-apocalyptic landscape and atmosphere.  I see people dislike the game for being repetetive, but I can't really remember any open world game that wasn't. If you like what you're playing, repetetiveness isn't negative - you just want more of the game. If you don't like the game to begin with, then of course the repetetiveness is like walking though Hell.   The game really feels like a Fallout reskin of Far Cry 4 (with a dash of Dying Light), and that's more than good enough for me, even with the technical issues and silly AI.  The mixed reviews is really unfair, it's a good game if you take it for what it is - a postapocalyptic FPS shooter with some minor RPG in it. And it even has a coop mode with characters and levels (although I haven't gotten around to that yet). People tend to complain that the game is short. I'm well over 30 hours and I'm not finished yet, although I do everything there is to do. I also don't rush trough on easy. I recommend playing at Deathwish difficulty to make the game last and to have an actual challenge.  I'll leave you off with a 7/10 rusty nails and a warning: It's not really open world, it's just not linear; the levels are big and square instead of straight - that way you can choose your own entry points when taking out bases.
2034	This is the worst FPS I have played in my whole life. It's like playing a beta game, it's full of bugs but it has good Artificial Deficient, the game world feels shallow and boring after a few hours, you'll basically do the same thing over and over and over again, side mission are so stupid they are a waste of time and not rewarding at all.  Note to self: Avoid this Developer in the future
2035	this game is a peice of â¥â¥â¥â¥. do not purchase it. it is the worst game of 2016. lame story. â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ graphics. id rather grind on clash of clan than playing this horrible game.
2036	BUYER BEWARE!!! So this is what i sent steam. This is my 3rd attempt refund of this crappy game i am disgusted to have in my library. As i said in my 2nd request,i started the game again(after about 1.5hr not aware of 2hr playtime limit) with a friend for second opinon to see if he might like to buy, also i would of spent at least half an hour adjusting graphic settings in game. I like to not rush my games , as this game has a nice intro/start,but when you finaly start to open up the game to see its true colours i was thourghly DISSAPOINTED. After using up 35.5GB i wanted to play enough to be sure i didnt like it ,and starting the game again to show friend put me over 2hr limit(when you try to refund for the first time you find this out). 2hr playtime limit for some games i think may not be sufficiant because these days games are alot involved and need some time to get to terms with? STEAM PLEASE REFUND, as this has been an expensive first time lesson! Saved money for summer sale and would like to swap for GTA5 please, cmon steam be a good sport. After all this im just a little girl and they still declined me.....$#@!
2037	  Homefront The Revolution is a disaster epic fail!!!! Old graphic, tech and level design is a epic fail. Deep Silver/Koch Media show here, there cant be like the big publishers. I play it for a couple hours, apparently it is horrifically bugged, stuttery and unplayable on the consoles and PC! Also it is so boring and boring! Better spend time for some better moments.
2038	RIP money gameply seems to be old style shooter except a few things like to cover system is really cool but thats it the shooting,momvment the AI are stupid  
2039	Not that great an ok game .. enemies spawning right before my eyes and when i aim to kill them they dissasapear...  
2040	Pro's- I was really grabbed in the beginning by the story about a revolution, it has very good characters and the voice actors really make the characters feel real! No repetitive main missions, every new main mission is a new experience. I never got bored with the main missions. Great animations including finishers, reloading guns, and interactions with other NPCs. Not a COD cliche story and action like the first Homefront. Has over 30 hours of main story gameplay.  Con's- Graphics can be better because they are working with the Cryengine. The permocrence needs a lot of work I have a AMD FX 8350 and a GTX 970 and I can't play above low so wait for performance patches. There are MANY glitches and the AI is really bad very easy compat on easy I would recommend going Normal or Hard difficulty. The multiplayer is a full rip of any other â¥â¥â¥â¥ing shooter barely no guns, repetitive team deathmatch, choosing classes doesnt matter its who ever pulls the trigger first and bad connection issues.  6/10 It's ok
2041	I really wanted to like this game. In fact, I preordered it. Unfortunately, the gameplay is mediocre at best.  The AI is plagued with pathfinding problems. More often than not you will get stuck in a room while your recruits block the exit; forcing you to either dismiss them of kill them. The enemy AI is very poor; at medium difficulty the game is way too easy.  The theme appealed me a lot, but because of all the problems, you do not get immersed in what was supposed to be a rebellion against foreign forces.  The graphics obviously suffer from the fact that this is a multiplatform game and textures have to be toned down for the PS4 and Xbox One.  Lastly, there are some serious optimization issues. I have a fairly decent PC with a 980 TI Strix and still I get poor frame rate from time to time.  Sorry, I cannot recommend this game. 
2042	SP bugged as â¥â¥â¥â¥.. still good enough to kill time.. Multiplayer is dead as â¥â¥â¥â¥.. Takes LITERALLY hours to find ppl online.. IF you're lucky.
2043	Gameplay is good, same as Far Cry or Dying Light  but it is very disappointing when finished, you can't roaming of the city....
2044	SO I personally Purchased this cause I am origanally from Philadelphia. So the week before this game I ordered 3 full boxes of Hot cheese Curls from HERR's so that i could get Phillyied up to play this Game. But as you could see I did not get far.  3/10 Game was Not Philly Enough For me!!!  P.S I still have 2 Boxes Left!
2045	Just played the single-player campaign. Didn't experience many bugs, some odd AI behaviour here and there, nothing serious. And by far not as much as some write here. Characters are somewhat stereotypes but that was to be expected.   Not sure if 60 bucks is justified, but I had fun and that's what counts. Pretty decent game.
2046	Beware, theives on the loose. Fix your game you utter tools.
2047	This game is Awesome!! It's everything I was hoping it to be. I am totally loving this game. Nice blend of stealth and action. Runs great on my Nvidia GTX 750ti card. What I really love about this game is there isn't constant screaming like you hear in call of duty games. The audio is perfect for me. If you love stealth and action games, I highly recommend this game! One of my favorites already!! I Love it!!
2048	Pro's- I was really grabbed in the beginning by the story about a revolution, it has very good characters and the voice actors really make the characters feel real! No repetitive main missions, every new main mission is a new experience. I never got bored with the main missions. Great animations including finishers, reloading guns, and interactions with other NPCs. Not a COD cliche story and action like the first Homefront. Has over 30 hours of main story gameplay.

2049	Honestly this game is one of the WORST games I've played ever, performance is garbage, even if you have a beast of a PC you would be lucky to get 45 fps on high settings. The story, if you can call it that, is boring and repetitive also. I would highly recommend that you save you're money and pass on this turd of a game. I'll be generous and give it a 4/10.
2050	Cant play for 15 mins before the game freases my PC, and i have a high spec rig.  Intel 5960k 64gb DDR4 Ram Asus Matrix 980ti NVME Drive 2 1TB SSD's   I dont recomend this game at all, NEEDS SERIOUS IMPROVEMENT. 
2051	This is a pretty good game. The story works well, graphics look good. Stealth is below average, but the knife takedowns have very nice animations. It is similar to the Far Cry games, with Dying Light as well.  Story 7/10 Graphics 8/10 Gameplay 7/10 Immersion 8/10  Overall 7/10
2052	Worst game i ever bought. Was excited when it came out, and streamed it for about 13 hours and the bugs and issues continued to get worse and worse. Missions were all the same, never anything different or new, got burnt on it fast, and the coop is just as bad. If you want something to keep you busy tell a better game comes out and can buy this for maybe 10 bucks than ya, but even 30 isnt worth it. Just stay away.
2053	7.5/10
2054	I honestly believe this game is really good! I do not know why people are complaining about it having a lot of bugs, frame rate issues, brain dead AI, and bad story. Well...... some of that is true but Dambuster Studio have indeed manage to fix some of these issues as they promised. My only problem with the game right now is that the story could have been better, (a little bit cheesy), The AI does need some fixing, and for some reason there are times when i start the game and when i get into the optimization is ok, but sometimes when I start the game again the performance it awful. Cannot tell if this is a bug or its just me  overall I do recommend this game, but be aware its not for everyone.
2055	What a waste of money! i should have taken more note of the negative reviews completely unoptomised graphics, boring gameplay, linear progression i did not even finish this buggy yawn fest honestly for $100 nz! what a rip off! wait till it costs $20, even then question buying this steaming turd
2056	I actually quite enjoyed this game. A lot of players seem to have not, and I am saddened by this. I did not see any performance issues outside of the game saving at the checkpoints and such. Only issues i had were the following:  - delays when saving the game (which because it is saving I am ok with) - one incident of the mission not working because a truck got stuck that I was supposed to escort: reloading a previous checkpoint fixed this General Play is a mix between Farcry and Crysis (which I absolutely love both). I would greatly suggest this game if you enjoyed Farcry and Crysis. Otherwise you most likely will not enjoy. I do hope that there is more merits released soon :D  My System:  - CPU: Intel i7-4820k (3.7 GHz) - GPU: Nvidia GTX 780 Ti - RAM: 12 GB - OS: Windows 7 64 Bit Pro
2057	Just no. The game mechanics are cool but thats about it. Very few weapons, weapons are clunky, the sights on weapons are awful and feel super unnatural. coop consists of 6 missions. All in all i just didnt find it enjoyable.
2058	Why the â¥â¥â¥â¥ is everyone saying this game is bad??? First fo when im writing this ive had 20 hours on record and this game is still fun and its not slowing down. Second off i havent even touched the multiplayer aspect which if its anything like the base game it should be amazing and bring in more then 20 hours itself no dout. Next i would like to say that this game has no major problems that stop it form being playable, 'but I have a good computer and when i run this game it lags everything' you might say, well heres a clue your computer is â¥â¥â¥â¥ if u cant run this game without any problems cause i bought my computer 3 year ago and last year i only updated my graphics driver to a Geforce 970 and this game works fine so before you start shiting on this game because of how â¥â¥â¥â¥ it is think about how â¥â¥â¥â¥ your computer is and if maybe it about time to upgarde it.
2059	This game was just awesome. Ignore the negative reviews, I didn't experience any performance issues. Don't miss out on your chance to kill north koreans with IED's...
2060	Actually pretty fun.
2061	7.5/10
2062	The story isnt so formulaic as many on here claim it is. There are also some quality historical echoes involved with being a freedom fighter against a foreign power in Philadelphia amongst the twists in the story arc.  It is less an open world shooter then it is a single path shooter with some extra areas to explore. I find that to be different enough from the mainstream games to be fresh. The graphics are top notch as well and I have had 0 issues with optimization. The only drawback as with many open world games is not all the terrain is smooth to operate on and there are some platform aspects that do not carry over so well.  The voice acting? I grew up around Philly and I gotta say. The voice actors they chose are top notch. These people sound exactly like I would imagine the Philadelphian resistance to sound like. Gun nut philosopies and all. Even the dirt bikes fit the theme of Philly although I wish they were actually useful and controllable.  Enemy AI is bad and the endless spawn in the open map is annoying. If you kill them fast enough and get cover away from the airships though, you're golden. A silenced pistol and skill with the crossbow are your friends. You will also learn to run away from your ambushes quickly .... that part is very realistic and I believe that to be their goal. This isnt a Rambo game. This isn't DOOM. You have to plan a bit before the shooting starts. Fortunately the AI is predictable and planning can be done with a minimal amount of scouting.  Overall. This game is getting a bad rap. For what exactly? idk. I've played many games with overall positive reviews and worse mechanics/coding.  This isn't The Division or Far Cry or DOOM. Apples and Oranges. It is a bit of everything and a little bit of the original Assassins Creed too.
2063	The game constantly locks up, if you wait a little however it will start responding again. The developers are poor programmers and have no idea how to properly manage computer assets particularly memory.   This application was poorly written and the developers need to move to a more managed code design, daily builds, pre-checkin checks, cpp check or sonarQube, like anything really. i feel sorry for any 'programmers' that had to work 40 hour weeks on this pile of rubbish.
2064	i was very excited when it came out. bought it within the first week to be completely disapointed. The game itself is quite short, Story is alright at best but gameplay is not good. side missions suck. game was very poorly optimized with bugs evreywhere. i miss those days where you could rent a game at blockbuster for 48 hours because i would have never bought this cancerous piece of leftover. if i could i would ask for my money back but gaben already spent it on the Co** and exotic dancers. thanks mate. i would rate this product - One of the many reasons Harambe died. may he rest in peace. not even worth 20$ at best.
2065	  Tried this on the free weekend. After sitting through the tedious, unskippable intro/cut scenes and boring tutorial sequence, I finally got to the resistance base and had to sit through obnoxious handholding and more dialogue. Made the fatal mistake of accidently exiting the area without crafting the molotovs as instructed, now I can't progress with the mission and the game won't let me go back into the base or load an earlier checkpoint. This left me with two options - waste another 10-15 minutes by starting again or quit out and uninstall the game. Have a wild guess what happened next.
2066	  this game sucks so badly
2067	  its meh. but it looks great (graphic wise)
2068	Clumbsy mess
2069	Wow. So boring. Even less story than first game. Maybe ok as online shooter. Avoid. Z-
2070	  Review after playing the free weekend (Approx 12 hours of play).  Well, I kept running into problems like one piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ said to pick up medical supplies from one location. I cleared that location and walked up to the vehicle that was marked as the location I had to go. I walked up to it and the marker faded away and I couldn't access the back of the vehicle or drive it or blow it up..nothing. It was a dead/bugged task.  I decide to clear the police station. I found a vantage point to take out all of the enemies from outside the walls. Then I waltz up to the doorways to enter and they're locked. I look for a way to open them. Nothing. After a while I read online that you have to blow them open. I place a remote explosive on the door. Back up. Detonate it...Nothng. Not a sscratch. So I watch walkthrough videos on youtube. All of them show the doors already blasted open. I can't get into the police station. Dead task.  Most jobs/tasks work but it's the ones that are broken that ruin it.  Also the constant repetition and the fact that noe of this gameplay is really original. We've done all of this in Prototype, Splinter Cell, Deus Ex and multiple other games.  Whoever developed this game was NOT American. The body movememnts when poorly designed characters like Dana move and her voice acting/lines were horrid. I checked multiple professional game reviews and they all agree the character creation sucked the left nut.  I am glad I played it for free. I wouldn't have paid for that and I am normally willing to pay full price for good games.
2071	I can't believe that I actually wasted money on this game. It is so full of bugs and glitches that it is not worth playing.
2072	  Just tried playing the single-player campaign for free because the previous one was good. After downloading it for over 2 days, I must say was terribly disappointed with the overall experience the game provided. Everything felt below par like a game developed perhaps five years ago. Story takes place in what feels like a post-apocalyptic world which was very much reminiscent of Metro 2033. Missions feel a tad like they are taken from Far Cry. Game-play doesn't feel smooth or enjoyable. Was pretty much hoping for the free duration to be over.
2073	20 minutes into it I discover bad platforming , infurating puzzles and lacklustre gameplay. SOOOO glad I didn't actually pay for this.
2074	Not worth the time or money. Played 20 minutes of it, controls are trash and hostile AI is garbage.
2075	Just finished the main story, didn't reach 100% completion however so I thought I'd offer my 2 cents.  Firstly, I'll say that I was playing on high on a single GPU, I had 3 instances toward the end of the campaign that saw my framerate drop to a crawl, but that remedied itself quickly. Other than that my framerates were fairly smooth. There was always a half-to-one seccond pause on autosave/gunsmith locker/store exiting, but I got used to that fairly quickly.  The game world -LOOKS- amasing, in my mind. Playing at 1080p, I loved it especially at night time. Fire effects look great, explosions were a little dissapointing both in visual and sound... more on sound later. NPC's look great, though some of the randomly generated combinations for resistance fighters look a little odd. I generally liked the look of the game, the details of the world especially (like the 'Where to Shoot' posters all over safe-houses and such.) and the atmosphere of the world is very well realised as far as the North Korean occupation of America is concerned. Each of the districts felt unique in my mind, nothing felt over-used in terms of terrain.  The sound was a little lackluster, though weapons sound great. Explosions and such don't sound too punchy, footsteps aren't loud enough either which doesn't assist stealth, when you come around the corner into a walking KPA trooper.  The weapons were cool, they look customised/personalised like a bunch of undisciplined civillians-turned-guerilla fighters would have. ('U mad Bro?' on the reflex sight? loved it) and the Guerilla Toolkit Items like Molotovs, Pipe Bombs, Hack Tools and Firecrackers and their deployment options all looked and felt decidedly cobbled together. It didn't feel like the resistance had 'too much tech' in my mind. And the KPA forces were suitably challenging all the way through (I played on the middle difficulty) and I really enjoyed the gunplay. I especially liked the first-person take on blind firing weapons and the cover system even if I had to fidget a little to make it work sometimes.  Missions though they are simple and use the same framework, to me, felt reasonably different. 'Eliminate the Snipers' task might take different forms. The first time snipers are occupying an appartment block, the seccond time you are investigating an overwatch post that went dark, only to find snipers have taken them out. etc.  The phone is a really neat way to handle your characters quests and such, just wish some of the text messages were helpfull other than just pats on the back from the major NPC's.  Motorcycles felt great, though collision wasn't ideal and running a KPA trooper down does nothing. Would have liked to be able to turn your view more and possibly use a sidearm whilst on the bike too.  My biggest issue is the way KPA NPC's and vehicles spawn in and out almsot at random, quite often a guard harassing a citizen that I was about to shoot after I put on my pistol's supressor would suddenly vanish. Or if I see a patrol with an APC on the streets of a red zone, when I duck behind cover and prep an exlposive strapped to an RC car, suddenly when I drive it to their location, they're totally gone... not driven away, just gone.  The story wasn't great, but I enjoyed it. All in all I will be giving it another go in a few patches time on harder difficulty. Probably working to make 100% completion.
2076	I bought it for Eur 30 (thirty) and until now I've played for 6 hours, completed in Single Player a 'hearts and mind mission' (star a revolt in a zone) , and I enjoyed it. The engine is quite fluid and also the graphics is good in my opinion. I have AMD FX 8350, 8 giga RAM DDR4, ATI Card 4 Giga. Also the AI BOT are quite good (at hard difficulty): they search for you in the zone if the spot you, they jump on building roofs (!), and also take cover, and start to shoot from far distance. Sometimes there is an AI bot bottleneck into bulding: they all come from the same door, you shoot and eliminate them all of them, they were 4 bots (but it happened only once). You can also engage allied AI bots, max 4 people, they automatically follow you: they essentially cover you when you advance. Eventually you also have to reach rooftoops, searching fo the right path (such as liberating tower in far cry). Nice 'mini-game'. So all in all, as the game is now patched, it is fun to play. The game style is a mix of far cry 2, far cry 4, metro last light, original homefront 1 (the setting). At last: Coop gameplay. I had today a coop match (3 people, infiltration mission). It was very fun to play. The gameplay was fluid. Hope this short comment will help in choosing the right game for you.
2077	It needs some work as things go along, but there is a lot of great things about this game. A bit of lagging in some areas, so it does need some attention from the developers. I hope to see the Revolution become a huge success, as this game has A LOT of potential. Graphics, interface, storyline, detail, all great things about this game. Of course, the lack of vehicle choice and weapons is dissapointing, but there's not a shoot'em-up game that I haven't said that about to-date. 7.5/10 (so far - will update once patches arrive).
2078	Even though the game itself seems pretty fun (albeit cheesy), I have constant freezes during the gameplay in totally random places.  And after a few small freezes game just hangs and can only be stopped using Task Manager :\
2079	Just finished the main story, didn't reach 100% completion however so I thought I'd offer my 2 cents.  Firstly, I'll say that I was playing on high on a single GPU, I had 3 instances toward the end of the campaign that saw my framerate drop to a crawl, but that remedied itself quickly.

2080	when theres game that works better inside of this game you know you done well
2081	I loved the original game, mainly the multiplayer.   They tried to make a Far Cry and failed.   If it had PvP multiplayer just like the first game, i would give a good review but no.   story - boring and predictable   gameplay - repetitive   graphics - good
2082	when theres game that works better inside of this game you know you done well
2083	I loved the original game, mainly the multiplayer.   They tried to make a Far Cry and failed.   If it had PvP multiplayer just like the first game, i would give a good review but no.   story - boring and predictable   gameplay - repetitive   graphics - good
2084	I'm liking the game, but it's so terribly optimized that it is damn near impossible to play. Maybe they'll compensate us, or at least patch it. I like the overarching story, but I can't really experience it at the moment. I have an I7 6700k and a 980oc and it's STRUGGLING to keep a consistent framerate...  Edit: THEY FIXED IT
2085	  I played the first Homefront so I was eager to try this one out during the free weekend. Unfortunately the choppiness renders this game unplayable, glad I didn't spend any money on it.
2086	  Step one, install Homefront on the free to play weekend.  Step two, play through the opening.  Step three, get freed from Steam's abuse by Amnesty international.  Step four, Uninstall Hamoefront from your computer.  Step five, burn computer to ashes to make sure nothing is left of Homefront.  Step six, place picture of computer on wall in memory of it's sacrifice to free you from the bonds of your own stupidity for installing Homefront in the first place.  Step seven, buy new computer.  Step eight, make review.
2087	Game honestly has good foundation but it needs work, the fps and stuttering and lag issues really make the game unplayable i have a decent beefy system and i still manage to get really low frames and lowering the quality does not do anithing i get the same frames as in high settings that low , due to the engine optimization. Everything else i like the style of homefront and its weapon modifications are one of the best things in this game, for now i dont suggest you purchase this game because it is not worth 60$ at the moment in later future or after the updates it might but at this stage its not worth buying.
2088	(NO SPOILERS)  I like this game so much already. The activities which you can do are so great. Sneaking, hacking, upgrading (weapons, gear etc.) and more. The story itself is also great including some horrific moments.  And yes there are some (small) negative points but not that huge so far i have discovered, and doesn't bother me that much. The game-play its fps is locked around 30 and further more you might discover some bugs/glitches Example, an Nork (North-Korean) sniper inside a tower, the walls of the tower are invisible and you might see through it. Or few invisible walls on the ground at some corners (i just discovered two of them but that's it).  Recruit innocent civilians and prisoners and let them join the Resistance against (North) Korea. Let them feel the uprising, show no mercy, take back what's rightfully yours, restore and show freedom to the world.  I recommend and rate this game 7/10.
2089	Hated it, too many bugs on release... I pre ordered it and the moment I played, graphics were crap.
2090	So; I bought and refunded after about an hour of gametime -- And I'll quickly explain why.   First the good -- From a technical stand point I didnt encounter a single problem; smooth 60+ with everything maxed. I was pretty surprised after hearing the Internet rabble prior to playing, so I was happy to see I wasnt one of those affected by tech problems.... But then I started playing, and I kind of have to end It there on the 'good'.   Because thats really the best I can say about this particular game. And even completely maxed out (At 1080) It still looks a bit dated at best, unimpressive for a game that released this year; maybe If it were a few years ago... This game immediatly reminded me of Metro (Take your pick) In Its gameplay and mechanics, and thats not really a good thing -- Granted both Metro's were, and are awesome games; like I said -- dated. Everything just feels 'off', even hopping over obsicles, or just walking/running looks weird and jerky.  The story and characters were pretty forgettable (IMO) for my short time, &amp; after my small hour or so Ingame I was not willing at all to push past that 2 hour mark to 'see If It gets better'.  All In all; I simply did not enjoy this game, and I wanted to.
2091	This game is an amazing game and i fail to see the reason people are rather â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ about it. I also dont understand how people are saying this game is a copy cat of others when obviously its not. I had zero issues with this game and its rather enjoyable.  Best way to describe it, its a hell of alot better than any far cry games.  EDIT: The only time I am experiencing any FPS drops is after I minimize my game. Other than that, its perfectly fine.
2092	Proberly the most boring game I ever played. It was ok in the first hour of gameplay but after the first hour it was boring. I got this game when it was free and I regret downloading it and wasting two hours of my life on it. The combat system is decent but the actual story is boring and the characters are uninteresting.The only thing that surprise me is that the game is able to run on my old 2012 PC which is a +2 in my book.If you like games like Far Cry or Gurilla warfare go for it but I don't want to waste 40 dollars on this game.
2093	Dont watse your time with this game....
2094	  Far Cry meets Koreans in Philadelphia.
2095	good game but there should have been some more map in multiplayer
2096	What can I say about Homefront: The Revolution?  PROS -Weapon part customization -Motorcycles -Stealth -Challenging -Parkour..Ish -YOU CAN THROW BRICKS!! Some windows will break if they're apart of a small building (Not a safehouse) -You can holster your weapon like a sane person (Mostly if you need to blend into crowds to hide from the KPA or if you're 'roleplaying'). -'Murica...  CONS -â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ FPS drops -Die WAY too fast -Okay storyline -â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ voice acting -AI is the most annoying thing asides from the FPS drops (They don't move out of your way, they sit there and give you a big flucking speach about looking where I'm walking, which is troublesome because if you're hiding from the KPA they corner you if you're in a tight space) -There's not continuation after the end. You must load a previous save.  TL;DR: The game isn't really ready to be sold yet, due to the lack of optimization and content. The game is fun until you beat it, then all you can really do is take back strongholds, explore, parkour, and kill. I'd recommend it if you're okay with bad lag on a great system, death almost right after the 6th shot, and kinda wasting $59.99.  Wait until it's on sale at least 30-40% if you want to save your money and pay for what this game actually is worth.
2097	  Just finished playing trough Homefront: The Revolution  Meh,  -Gunplay and Movement 10/10 perfect example of how to do that, amazingly satisfying and fun.  -Stealth 7/10 -Some good ideas but the lack of an alarm system and all enemies  knowing where you are after 1 spots you made it quite hard and bullcrap.  -Animations 2/10 -There were animations  they were bad  and choppy  REALLY CHOPPY  (like litteral robot style)  -Story is a good  6/10 -Base story of the Koreans caputring america is pretty sweet actual story of the revolution is pretty wack, plot twists are foreseeable.  Overall  A good 7/10  -A lot to be improved in animation and a lot of bugs (still) but the gunplay and movement a.k.a. as your character flows trough the playable area, and the (kind of) stealth mechanism saved the game (for me).
2098	This game was better than i expected it to be, an open world-ish FPS Shooter was amazingly fun, it could get repetative with the bases and stuff you needed to take over for the people to rebell but still fun.  The story was okay, I enjoyed it at least. Somethings i didn't get (probably beacus i can be a bit slow) I wish it wasn't as easy for the police oe what you want to call it to recognize you in the city, if they start to spot you, almost the only thing you can do is kill them, run away or try to get behind some people, which is hard because it's not that many npc groups to hide in.  I would still recomend for anyone who likes FPS shooters, and might want some story to it. 
2099	since day 1 not a single multiplayer sever up...the coop is a joke shouldnt even be able to say there is coop.
2100	Not worth anything over $15 It's not a terrible game, but there is some bad points. gliching through enemys when driving anything, the gunplay is pretty bad, mediocre 'crafting' system, badlyt optimised with no sense of direction in the story that also was boring as hell with the chain of events leading up until you get your first gun making no sense. I'm not saying this is a bad game, just not worth how much it isn being sold for. If you can look past all the stuff listed above it's actually a very pretty game with some good lighting effects etc. Overall though, would not reccomend this unless it's on at least 70% sale.
2101	well homefront first was better than this in case of different graphics sites, i mean there we used to see the land with grass different sites here only building and structures pff, still gameplay and shooting was awesom, no bugs i found in game idk why peoples complaning about bugs, i didnt face any in entire game,  must play game,  best part i like about this game is shooting , guns custumizations..
2102	So you can play Resistence Mode with 2 players, but if you fail at the end of a mission, as we did, and you try to play again, you no longer have the supplies you used up during the last attempt. So every time you fail, you have less and less of a chance to succeed. I used all my explosives destroying tanks the first attempt and then had no way to kill the tanks (a requirement of the mission) on a second try without deleting that character and starting over. Ridiculous. I'm just deleting this from my account and moving on.
2103	TL;DR Fun, but not 'full price' fun. Get it on sale.   I haven't got a ton of time in the game yet, so I'll only be reviewing the single player game for now.   Pros: Looks really nice. Lots of customization. The guns are pretty fun. Motorcycle riding is kind of a blast. Most major bugs patched out.  Cons:  Weird FOV. (vertical and not horizontal; makes the game feel a little strange at first) Weird sound decisions. (black guy with a white guy's voice, etc) Story isn't very good. Obviously made first and foremost for consoles. (controls, options, etc)  Summary; This game is OK. The graphics and effects are beautiful, and the game play is fun, but the story is boring and predictable. I wouldn't recommend it for full price, but I got it on sale for $30, and that seems like a fair trade to me.
2104	One of the worst made games i've ever seen. If you can't pick this up for under $10 then don't bother.
2105	The only word I can think of when playing this game, clunky. That is how it feels to me. The graphics are great but it just doesn't feel well thought out Almost like they rushed this title. The gameplay is clunky, the controls are clunky. After playing this long enough I think I am clunky. I will finish this game one day. When I have nothing left better to play or just want to get it over with to make room. The one thing this game does have going for it, I have played worse!
2106	  I played the story for about 50 min. It took about 15 before they turn control over to you to do some fetch quests and then another 5 min of story before you even get a gun to shoot it. I woudn't recommend this game on its own merit. If you're a fan of the Far Cry series then there may be something here for you but if you were looking for a deep level of immersion maybe look elsewhere. 6/10
2107	waste of money and time :)
2108	since day 1 not a single multiplayer sever up...the coop is a joke shouldnt even be able to say there is coop.
2109	Sadly, I am glad I didn't buy this.  Pros: Looks good - CRYENGINE Cool weapon customisation system Feeling of being a guerilla fighter  Cons: No real substance to capturing things Lacklustre scavenging and crafting Very arcade-y feel Story is not very strong for a campaign game  If you are looking for something in a similar vein but better: Dying Light Deus Ex
2110	I did like the first Homefront, making me part of a very small group of people.  For better or for worse, this game is entirely different in all regards except for the setting; instead of story based linear missions, it is an open world liberation fest that allows for almost unlimited freedom to do what you want (past the scripted intro segments), which in theory should be great.  However, the game just doesn't feel fun to play. The gunplay is unsatisfying on keyboard and mouse because of some funky mouse handling (and I tried the acceleration fix, so I'm not sure what exactly the problem is, but it just feels wrong to me, like the sensitivity is both too low to aim rapidly, ala SMG, but too high to aim precisely, ala sniper rifles. Now, some people might say 'But you can fix it', but honestly, who wants mouse acceleration? If you use a mouse for anything other than gaming, you're used to how a mouse works. It's a stupid idea and always implemented in such a way as to make it worse for players who are proficient with their mice) and gameplay (getting shot at is tedious because you never know exactly how much damage you'll take, so you die unexpectedly while other times you can survive incredible amounts of damage, seemingly based on a coin toss). The aesthetic is also a bit tedious; it feels like someone took Homefront and was like 'But what if it looked like Terminator?' which is not a terrible idea except for implementation; on low settings, it looks like sludge (and my rig can't hit high) with performance hits and unholy amounts of bloom when you transition from a lit area to a dark area, to the point where operating during the day is tedious because your screen will wash out if you step into shadows. While the performance was stable, it was unimpressive for the graphical fidelity delivered.
2111	I tried out the game during the free weekend and I gotta say I want my money back. It's an extremely shallow and repetitive game. I enjoyed the first game and this one is nothing like it.
2112	What a disappointment. This must be the most generic Open World FPS ever made. Not only is the plot uninteresting and the gameplay dull, but there is virtually nothing new to this game. I loved the first entry to the series but this one is a major letdown. I'd recommend to skip this one.
2113	I had a lot of fun playing this game, never issued any bug. What else do you need from a game exepte having a lot of fun?
2114	Decided to give this game a chance after seeing all the bad reviews, turns out I did the right thing trusting my gut on this purchase.   Have i7 3770, gtx 970, and 8 gig ram and I'm running the game on ultra setting with no problems, only a few frame drops here and there but doesn't last long.   For all those people hating on the game because of bugs upon release, take a look back at all of the games that have been released in the past several years, there are some exceptions but most of them had bugs upon release aswell with some that were much worse than this but almost always they patch the game soon after. I understand that it sucks you can't play the game right now, but you cant just base your review off of that either.   For those saying the weapon handling isnt that great well think of it this way, you are an ordinary citizen with no prior training who decided to join the uprising. Ofcourse you arnt going to have the perfect aim and your weapon will sway alot, you can fix those by upgrading your weapons over time.   I like the fact that this game doesn't have a grinding system like the division, meaning I don't have to first become like a level 30 to do certain missions and things like that.   I think this game could be great after several patches fixing some of its issues. You should also trust your gut rather than other peoples reviews for this game and try it for yourself. Play the game for 2 hours, if for any reason you don't end up liking it then you can submit a refund for it.
2115	This game is just plain bad. I am running a i5, 980ti, with 16gb of DDR4 ram and the frame rate drops like a lead brick when things get busy. The audio is terrible as well, walking through the town my ears are assaulted with a cacophony of garbled murmurs and what I assume was supposed to be backround noise. Bugs, bugs and more bugs; I had to restart the game 3 times because for some reason i would get stuck on 'auto-walk' after I concluded dialogue with an NPC. Hands went through doors, interaction were unavailable, enemies walked through/saw through walls... I could look past the technical garbage too with the hope that patches and updates could solve these issues, but only if there was a story and characters I cared about. The writing and characters are archtypical, trite re-hashes of â¥â¥â¥â¥ we have been seeing in action films since the 80s. Don't expect anything original or compelling. The enviroments and NPCs are boring and uninspired, playing this game is akin to playing counter-strike in a server full of bots.The lore is interesting I suppose, except for the fact that the US would never purchase weapons from an enemy state, that's just absurd to me...   Graphics (when the game runs properly, which is about 35% of the time): 8/10 Sound/Audio: 1/10 Gameplay: 3.5/10 Story/Characters: 2/10 Overall: 2.5/10  I requested a refund, I am tired of getting burned with paying for premium titles and getting flaming dog turds in return... i.e. Farcry: Primal BLAH.
2116	I've played through the whole story line and let me say, this game is well worth the buy. The storyline is action packed mixed in with some touchy moments. This game, I will say, is NOT call of duty. You cannot just run and gun the whole thing, even on the lowest difficulty setting. This game puts you in the role of a resistance fighter, not a soldier, and as such you fight in the style of guerilla warfare. You will need to run away sometimes but that's what they were going for.  The visuals are gorgeous and have very little loading screens, however as a result there are some frame rate drops which I hope they can address, all in all very minor. The cut scenes are brilliantly animated, hats off for that as well.   With a few patches I'd give this game an 8/10, but for now I'll give it a 7/10, which for a game that has been in developmental hell for the better part of 5 years I say is fantastic.   Also just as small note I have not played Coop yet. I'll edit this when I've played it for a few hours.  *EDIT* Dambuster Studios acknowledges the the optimization issues and is working on a patch
2117	Once you get a bit used to the aiming(took me 3 hours)Homefront can be a great game.Amazing graphics but if you have a potatoe pc(laptop whatever)don't buy it caus' it seems like the kind of game that would have a great amount of lag for those without a pc that can run these kinds of graphics smoothly.
2118	I really enjoy the approach this game takes, and it's a much needed change in pace from the multiplayer scene it was trying to be a part of if it wanted a chance in the industry with Battlefield and COD as such heavyweights, Homefront needed something different.  If theres one thing this game is, it's different. Not only from the older homefront games, but even while it tries to take a Far Cry 'Approach It Your Way' theme, it still manages to be its own game. I've only played a few hours, and have only touched the surface of the story, but so far it seems promising. Gameplay is smooth, and I've had nothing but fun playing with it so far.
2119	Completed it on the hardest difficulty and - well - i've enjoyed it. Most of the times i had to think before an ancounter or completely avoid it, like in a guerrila. Sure it has many tecnhical flaws but the game still looks nice. The setting is fantastic.  Homefront: The Revolution is way different than the first one though, this has different open areas of the city where you have to complete missions (in a sandbox way) and conquest every outpost on the map, to let the rebels secure their position inside the city and get rid of the filhty NKA (North Korean Army). Look at it as some sort of Far Cry mixed with a (this is subjective) STALKER feel, but here instead you do feel like a real rebel fighting for his own people's freedom.  My performance weren't great but still better than what people are yelling around. Considering that i'm on a GTX 980 Ti i got 54-68fps on @1440p.  In short, it's a fun - and beatiful - game that even with its flaws (bugs and some animations) doesn't deserve all this hate.   Grats to the devs for finally delivering it, despite all the issues tha they've had during the development.  Just don't buy it right now, wait for the next 50% sale.   About the co-op:  I managed to play 10-11 missions in co-op at normal and hard. It's really fun but may be bored pretty soon. There are A LOT of unlockables and skills to buy but only 6 missions (that you have to repeat). Anyway it isn't the main focus of the game.
2120	So, quite frankly you can throw out most of the bad reviews saying this game is terribly optimized. I'm on a laptop, and was apparently the most popular Steam Streamer for a while - While playing this game.  So, even with the graphics at max, i get no studdering or frame rate issues. Which really makes me think it's not the games optimization. but the people's systems who are complaining about said optimization.   The game itself, so far seems like a great sequel - though I don't actually know if it's even directly related to the original homefront. The game is a Red-Dawn story being told in a game format which is very exciting. Especially when set at the most difficult difficultly, it makes you play the game much more stealthy-guerilla warfare-y or you'll die a lot. It seems like the AI really know what they're doing and how to respond to you for the most part.  I don't know much about the multiplayer, but as soon as a friend gets the game and plays it with me. I'll update on my thoughts on the game.  Also It's midnight and I just worked a lot. So I'll probably edit this thing tomorrow or the next day to word it better.
2121	If you like resistance like games and enjoy tactical based shooters rather than running around like Master Chief or COD spraying everything to pieces then this might be for you.  Firstly, in a response to all the negative reviews about optimisation, I honestly don't know what they're on about. I'm on a GTX 770 and I'm playing on high without any issues. The only time it stutters for a few seconds is when the game autosaves which if no one has noticed, a few other games do that too  Personally I like the game, I think fighting against a stronger opposittion using hit and run tactics is enjoyable and you're prone to dying a lot, even on medium difficulty.  Weapon customisation is pretty badass, especially as you can see things being changed physically in front of your eyes.  You've got two different zones in the game, Yellow zones and red zones. Yellow Zones are heavily policed and are filled with civilians and security. Yellow zones are you living and breathing occupied neighbourhoods where stealth and planning is more prone.  The red zones are areas where the the resistance is actively fighting the KPA in a more straight up kind of way. Red zone is shoot to kill and you'll often come across various resistance fighters going toe to toe with enemy forces. The red zones are also pretty rough looking with destroyed buildings and burnt out cars being common.  The only real issue I could say I have with the game is the introduction, it throws you too quickly into blowing â¥â¥â¥â¥ up with no build up. I'd have liked it if we had more build up and were without weapons for a while rather than being given a pistol after the first mission and throwing molotovs are armoured cars. Within 40 minutes depending on how you spend your money you can buy an Assault Rifle (M4 Carbine) which seems a little rushed and not much of a build up to it.  You can't use enemy weapons, and it's never explained why so you'll be using whatever you've got/bought to fight the KPA and spend time searching bodies for ammo and supplies.  The campaign is basic but I'm finding it to be pretty fun so far, same with the COOP resistance mode which is fun to play. If anything the online mode feels to have a bit more build up in the way you look and are equiped. You'll start coop mode with some simple clothing and a weapon in each catergory (Assault Rifle, Shotgun, Battle Rifle) and from there you'll level up and go from grime covered Joeblogs who's picked up an M4 to someone wearing heavy battle armour and a gasmask.  All in all I'd give the game a 7/10 I'd say  TL:DR  Pros - Pretty fun gameplay - Weapon Customisation - Loot Simulator - COOP - Graphics - Red and Yellow zones  Cons - Not enough build up - Weapon variation can be a little lacking (Only one assault rifle) - Vehicles aren't too great (Been on motorcycles only so far) - AI can be a 50/50 sometimes with being stupid or out right ruthless.  This game isn't for everyone, but it's not as bad as people are making it out to be so far. Take into consideration a lot of people are complaining about optimisation which can be fixed.
2122	It ran well, played well, looked good... but it's essentially Dead Island with North Koreans instead of zombies. Once I got past the 'ooooo' and 'ahhhh' phase of the weapon customization, and the detail to the models... I got bored.   Go to this location, kill these guys, blow up or hack this... congrats the resistance has a new base. Now repeat that. OR completely skip all that, sneak in.... steal some stuff. Congrats all the enemies disappear and are replaced with allies in the blink of a loading screen.  If my opinion changes from more gameplay, my review will change.
2123	so life is a wierd thing and actual reviews are a waste of time so i got something better   enjoy this chicken stir fry recpie   - Serves 4 - 10 mins to prepare and 10 mins to cook - 325 calories / serving - Healthy  INGREDIENTS:  - 1 orange, zested and juiced - 2tbsp soy sauce - 2tbsp sesame oil - 250g (8oz) tender stem broccoli - 5cm (2in) piece root ginger - 1tbsp sunflower oil - 1 garlic clove, finely sliced - 1 red pepper, deseeded and thinly sliced - 150g Straight To Wok Noodles - 400g (13oz) chicken fillet, cut into thin slices  METHOD  Step 1 - Mix together the orange zest and juice, soy sauce and sesame oil and set aside.  Step 2 - Blanch the broccoli in boiling water for 2 minutes, then drain well and set aside.  Step 3 - Finely shred the ginger.

Step 5 - Add the red pepper and broccoli and stir-fry for around 2-3 minutes until it's just tender. Add the soy sauce mixture, bring it to the boil then return the chicken to the pan
2124	to many people complaining about the same thing.. but the game runs great for me and ive enjoyed the story, Watch someone streaming it and see if its your kind of game before you buy it. BTW the 'Hard' setting is actually realy hard and i love it!
2125	Have to say this game has already given me some memorable moments.  After the prologue the first two times i found a bike i drove it like i have never driven any vehicle in a game, and proceded to nearly run over the koreans and my allies while barely missing buildings and vehicles. I don't use them anymore.  But honestly the game has enough flashy parts to keep you interested and the game has a nice difficulty so that i can't just grab the marksman rifle or assualt rifle and treat this like the coop missions in CSGO.   The characters are detailed, better than than that one game..... Division..... so you can easily like or hate people.  Honestly i was expecting something more like this from The Division.   My biggest gripe is that the campaign is not co-op, i enjoy even bad games if i can bring my friends with me, and this isn't bad.
2126	I've had no problems with the game, and its really fun to play with friends.
2127	If you can disregard the abisal performance, the game is in line with a Far Cry. I enjoy this type of game and Homefront bring a couple of good idea in the mix... But you must know that is run's like... Really, really BAD.
2128	see for yourself, this is an fps game,, story hardly matters to me, all I need is awesome old school like feeling gameplay, and yes homefront has just delivered it.. buy it and play it, the graphic is epic and no fps, crash,bugs issues for me,,
2129	Well, I never really had serious high hopes for this game to start with, but after playing a bit of both campaign and Coop; I do have to admit that it is fun in it's own right.  I definitely do NOT believe the game is worth it's MSRP of $60, especially with the lack of optimization, poor keyboard and mouse customization support (changing keys in menu revert back to defaults as soon as you exit back to game), and the lack of content in it's semi-sandbox world. Now, after saying that, I have to admit that I bought my key off of â¥â¥â¥ for half the retail price, so IMO; The game has enough to justice my paying price of $30, but definitely doesn't hold up it's justification of being $60.  AT CURRENT STATE = Date of Review 05/19/2016  PROs: -Latest version of CryEngine 3 (Looks great in most areas). -Solid gameplay mechanics bundled with dedicated coop (coop is a blast with a group of good buddies). -Decent arsenal of weaponry at your disposal, including attachments, craftable equipment, and gear. -Voice acting doesn't suck nearly as bad as I assumed it would.  CONs: -terrible optimization. Running on a GTX 980, I am only able to run most settings at 'High', even then frames bounce well between the 50s down to the 30s when there are more than a few AI on the screen (with enemy vehicles). -Horrible Keyboard and Mouse support. Changing certain keys will save in menu, but once exited back to gameplay, changed functions maintain default key press on top of what corresponding key that function has been assigned to.  Overall: 7/10  Final Verdict: With the certain flaws this game has, it does shine with a fun coop experience even if just for a few hours at a time. I'd still recommend this game to a friend, but I'd urge getting a copy from a respectable key site for cheaper. Once patched and optimized, this game will surely be bump to a justifiable 8/10.
2130	I had some hope for this game but nothing unrealistic.   Graphics - fairly okay graphics, nothing anyone that's played shooteres hasn't seen before, decent night lighting, and using the flashlight at night actually illuminates like a flashlight. NPC character models are just okay copy and pasted NPCs with maybe a duifferent weapon or helmet.  Sound - Okay sound quality as well, voice acting is okay. Actual voice from characters in the game is wonky, Sometimes too loud, too quiet, some times screaming at your face and then whispering to you.  Gameplay - The meat and potatoes and I'll sum this up to be quick.  - A to B Ultra linear progression, example, you start off in a district, and then follow story points, rinse repeat. The only difference is that there are some side stops you can make on the way and loot. On that topic, you have an EXTREMELY simple craft and loot system, nothing crazy just 5-6 ingrideints to make a grenade or two, or a couple of devices.  - Side missions, pop up and repeatable usually the Same AI's in the Same exact area doing the same exact thing. There are other Side missions to do that arent repeatable.  - The AI, is weak at BEST, most don't engage you, and if they do all you need to do is find a corner or doorway preferably, and then simply wait as they single file rush the door one at a time, if they even manage to find the doorway pathing. Most will stand in the open waiting to shoot at you, some take cover... very few react to seeing you, unless you let yourself get scanned. Friendly AI is even weaker, there's a half parkour system, the AI does not use any of it, and won't follow you unless there's a walkable path.   On top of this the enemies here are pretty much actual robots, they take upwards of 2 headshots to 6 nody shots to bring down, unless your using sniper so if your expecting realism this isn't going to be your sauce.  AI spawn points are pretty terrible too as it's possible to clear a building or containers and have enemies spawn where you just cleared. even if you were undetected.  attacking enemy walled strongholds is a joke, the enemies attempt to leave the stronghold or buildings to come kill you, or simply run arund ground level in the middle of it. Instead of using cover and tactics to try and fight you.  AI -10/10  Alot of the Gameplay is just repetative go here fight take point move to next point and its from a pool of the same 5-6 side mission pools, mixed with bad ai is just bad, with a very small customization pool , it's just not a game it's a pro longed demo TBH.    TLDR - Not a complete game. Is Long Demo. Not worth anything more than 20$. DLC is even bigger waste.   Another game that again just seems to over anticipate itself. Already claiming to have 'Seasons' worth of DLC ready to go, well perhaps if any of the DLC were in the game it would have been more fun.
2131	Pretty fun open world conquer sector by sector game.
2132	Alright,before i start speaking in details,i would like to talk about the graphical part first  i have a GTX750ti,i5-3450 CPU and 8GB RAM and i am playing this game from very high to high settings. So far its working smoothly,and i am not having any graphical problems But please note,i have turned off the SUPER-SAMPLING because it was making the game unplayable,so i will advice you to keep it down because i guess it is the primary reason for low FPS for other players,even if you have a great pc.   I didn't face any glitches or bugs till now,like others have mentioned,so i guess i am lucky so far.  Now i will talk about the game  This game is not for everyone.Even though it has influences from Far Cry and Dying light,still it has distinguished itself in a very unique way,for me at least. How ? i will come to that later  But let me tell you,if you have played Far Cry or Assassins Creed series,you will like this game.It follows the same formula.Capture bases,do side Jobs for money,help random citizens or assassinate a KPA general,collect all the collectibles,capture an enemy base to create a safe house....so if you are a gamer who loves this busy work and doing all the side quests and all,you will love this game...but if you are tired of Ubisoft's formula then you will hate it. So first decide what type of gamer you are,then only buy this game.  Now coming back to the unique thing about this game i had mentioned,this game is brutal.This game is brutal.This game is not COD,.that you will just run and gun or like Far Cry,that you will have regenerating health and there will never be a sense of danger.  This game will â¥â¥â¥â¥ you up,if you just approach it casually. The A.I is good(if not the best),they will hunt you down, if you are not careful.You need to create a strategy,of how you would like to approach a target,how you have to spend you currency because everything is expensive. Eg:The protective gear is 5000 in cash,maybe you will decide to start saving money,but you also need health kit but you dont have any ,either you can go looking for it in a stash or buy it.Looking for it might be risky because you have to get past the KPA guards but it will save your money.Buying it will be easy but you will lose money.  I loved this aspects of this game coz it made me feel like i am a normal person.I am not some God-gifted character who will just survive everything easily.My character will develop only if i end up buying gear and upgrades that's it.So theres a sense of progression.  So everything needs to be carefully planned out in this game ,like a guerilla. You cannot just stand there and shoot everyone.You have to make the decision to run away and come back with a different plan.Capturing the bases is not easy.Its you style which will make it unique.  The story so far is simple.I am in the yellow zone and i am working to motivate the people to start uprisings and all.I mean its a 'Revolution' game,what else we should expect ?  The open world is distinctive. Till now i have unlocked two zones: red and yellow Red is where you can go with your guerilla buddies and screw everyone up,yellow is where your enemies are stronger and you are mostly alone,so you have to use stealth,or they will â¥â¥â¥â¥ you up.So i can say so far the two zones are different and not similar which is nice.  So at the end ,this game is not broken,not the worst game you will ever play blah,blah Every game has an audience and i think it will only appeal to a particular audience. I found it great coz i am a part of that audience but i understood that it will not cater to other eveyone here.  So if you have read all my points and you think this is your game,buy it.... If not then don't waste your money.
2133	While giving this game my full attention for months and watching it, hoping it'd be good since I loved Homefront 1, I am appalled by the pure lack of awareness for this game's optimisation.  Not to say Homefront: Revolution is a bad -game-, it's far from that. The story is a fantastic idea, dare I'd say fantastical, and the voice acting is superb. The sounds are fine and the gun mechanics are fine (for someone who mostly just buys CoD or Battlefield for it's campaign.   Where it lacks, though, is just the technical side. With a 65 Field of Vision lock my nausea kicked in almost 15 minutes in. I was sick to my stomach and everything I did from turning off background processes to disabling an entire secondary display did nothing to aid my growing physical sickness. To add salt to my wounds the FPS lock of 30, while I don't really care wholeheartily, no doubt added to my sick feeling.   Now add in the fact the loading screens lock up for 15 minutes or more and in the middle of combat awful blurry lag spikes seal your fate and normally if a scanner UAV sees you from afar the game poops on itself attempting to render th elong-ranged detection. I would not recommend buying the game in it's current state, but I would recommend keeping an eye on it. Maybe an optimisation patch will come out in a week or month. Perhaps I'll re-purchase it at a later time when it's cheaper and wont cause my brain to flip upside-down.    For the sake of TL;DR, I'd give it a 6/10. I had fun playing what I could before actually becoming sick, and it is a fantastic story just like the first. All-in-all, don't buy it yet, but at least buy it later if/when it's improved technically. 
2134	The game runs fine for me.   The single player is alright but it starts really slow with a lot of hand holding and cutscenes.  The coop is really fun, similar to a Payday 2 mission format in a semi-open world.   over all I'd recomend it.
2135	game is sweet , runs smooth
2136	was a decent game but, there is problems, the game glitches, jumps,freezes and also the speech is not paired. False advertisment aswell. but overall the game had a 'decent' story line, a bit short but decent. i wouldnt reccomend this game to anyone, unless you want to spend your money on a rushed piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
2137	Early access quality, Clunky movement, Garbage PC port, repetitive side mission, stupid AI, annoying enemy spawn. I thought I would love Sandbox Action/FPS Games even if they are bad, Homefront: The Revolution makes me think twice. The game in its current status is just BAD, real BAD, DO NOT BUY it right now. Wait till they fix the PC port or just purchase it on â¥â¥â¥/Steam Sale. It is not worth 60 bucks, it should be a Maximum 25 dollars piece of garbage.
2138	I found this game very fun and believe that the hate towards it is undeserved. While I have played it have only had about 2 frame drops total and they only lasted about 30 seconds. It also has a great weapon costimization process and it is insanely fun to use the flame launcher in groups of large enemies.
2139	I'm having fun playing this game.
2140	LATEST AND FINAL UPDATE: I finished the game, 30 hours all told, and I really enjoyed it. I had one lockup after 27 hours, but that was it, otherwise it was great and mostly glitch free, one small bug that prevented a minor side mission from being completed, but nothing that effected the campaign. So, as before, I give the game a definite thumbs-up.   UPDATE: I now have over fifteen hours in and I'm still enjoying the game. The game world gets even more interesting when you reach the Ashgate Yellow Zone (which is the third Yellow Zone, if you include the first one you see at the start of the game). There is color and a whole different looking environment than the first couple of Yellow Zones.  And in those fifteen hours no crashes, no glitches and most smooth 60fps gameplay. It has slowed down at times, but the only way I knew was via the Steam fps counter, otherwise I never would have even known it's was doing 60fps. And damn, it's a really pretty, very detailed game.  ORIGINAL REVEW: I have in just under eleven hours on the Steam version and Iâm really enjoying it. It does have some rough spots, but itâs a lot of fun to play. I like open world games and Homefront scratches that itch. I think combat is a lot of fun and the modular weapon system works great and is a nice change. The plot is rather thin, but really so was the plot in Watch_Dogs and it didnât bother me. The game map is fantastic. I donât have any issues with the âgreynessâ of the Red Zones, there is a lot of color and objects around all that concrete. And there are tunnels and high catwalks and all sorts of paths to use.  I do have issues trying to access some of the harder to reach locations, the game doesnât make them easy. However the designers included a clever system of using blue paint or flags to let the player know that there really is something to find and gives hints on how to reach them.  Some people have faulted the AI, but Iâm finding them a challenge. They do seek cover when fired on, call in reinforcements and will flank you. And in the Yellow Zones, your stealth techniques really do get a workout.  Itâs not a perfect game, but it is fun. And if it doesnât break new ground in some areas, itâs better that the recent Assassinâs Creed games and as interesting (in a different way) as Far Cry 3 or 4. Fair warning however; it does take a good half-dozen hours before you really experience the complete gameplay.
2141	If you're reading this chances are you already know what this game is about. I'm not usually a person to call out a game for not being perfect for everyone, but this game is actually disappointing. I love the setting, I love the idea behind it, and I love how it looks, but this is honestly a terrible game. It feels empty and non-engaging.   The A.I. is a joke. I bought it under the impression that one would constantly feel outclassed and outgunned, but the opposite seems to be the case. I am a god compared to the A.I. North Koreans, slaughtering them without any real challenge whatsoever. The city, although beautiful and well contructed, is empty and without much going for it. Everything just seems empty. Again, this game just feels empty and non-engaging. There's constant radio blare while playing but none of it means anything. Perhaps they're trying to make you feel part of the revolution but it honestly just feels like any other FPS on the market, if not less so because there's no reason to play this. Literally, it feels like they didn't even try to make an actual story.   Whoever gave this the green light should be fired, because this isn't even close to finished and it feels heavily rushed. It was a perfect setting and a perfect idea but they seriously messed up somewhere along the lines when making this. I don't make video games so I wouldn't understand the resources and what not this would require to make but damn, this is just a job poorly done. Save your money and spend it elsewhere, because this isn't it.
2142	I had some pretty high hopes for this game. But in all honesty this game amounts to a steaming pileâ¦ The controls are very loose and they really don't seem like a FPS should be at all. It doesn't look like it even uses V cried â engine to me. What the graphics and lose control reminded me of is 'thief deadly shadows'. I would like to play this game a bit more but I don't want to go over the Time to return limit.Three thumbs down... and to everyone complaining about the frame limit and optimization I don't really understand, I get between 50 and 90 frames Per second and my system isn't special. (Except for my overkill of RAM)
2143	Games pretty good for what I wanted. It's got an interesting customization feature where you can change stuff on the fly. It's got the conversvion system which allows something like a pistol to become an smg. While I can see it getting tedious in the future I don't mind the hearts and mind system. It's a system where in each zone you must do things like strike points, forts, and protect the citizens. After you get to a 100 you do a couple story missions then on to the next zone. I can see how this might get repetitive to some but I enjoy it. I'm also playing on deathwish as i heard the enemies were a bit braindead. They are but playing on deathwish made me use the recruit system which basically means you can recruit resistance members, and have them fight for you. I've also heard the optimization on some specs are bad, and numerous glitches but I haven't ran into any yet. If you're looking for a city far cry this game is right up your alley. If you want something with more substance, and less busy work look somewheres else. I give this game a 7/10.
2144	My first impression is that this game is basically Dead Island with North Koreans instead of Zombies. Although it is accurate, I still enjoy this game as it is a breather to all other shooters out there that focused too much on just graphics or DLCs. This game was even better than Dead Island: Riptide, but not as good as Dying Light. Still, nice one, Deep Silver. Kudos on the efforts.  In short, the game has potential, though I do say the game requires more tweaks on the AIs, Voice Acting &amp; other parts of the game, such as the vehicles. I give it a 6.9/10. Will be waiting for fixes.
2145	Game has slugish movements and is just a bad game overall
2146	1. I am loving the game the more I get into it, I love the concept the enviornment and for those of use that the current patch helped, the graphics are impressive when not even maxed out. This is just a really cool concept and I thiink it's been done very well. I am very excited about the add on content of the DLC's As mentioned before little things like the best rain effects I've ever seen in a game really make the enviornment immersive. It's been a long time since I've been this vested in a game. If 1.5 does makes no improvements for me, I'd be happy anyway if it fixed it for a lot of the people still having problems. I want them to be able to enjoy the game for what it is.  2. It's impossible to not have repitition in this type pf game, but with the exception of flashpoints they manage to keep it from feeling like you are just doing the same thing over and over. Maybe it's because there are so many viable way to take over a base/point of interest. Even though some have very similar layouts, I've taken them all over in different ways. The flash points are usually pretty much the same, but it's a free $250, so I'll take it!   3. I'm a gamer. To some degree, almost all titles offer some support at launch, these dev's have been pretty awesome with the feedback and responsivness. If you surf a lot of threads, you see them reply to a lot of posts. This is unusual for a AAA release, many issues have been resolved and I feel very strongly by the Dev's interaction with the community more will be solved. They even reply in a positive manner to posts that are nasty. This is why I would not be a good Dev, I'd be inclined to tell more people to go f themself. People â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ at them a lot and they have been really proactive. Go to Doom's forums and see how many times the dev's post there.
2147	Take note that I have not come across any game breaking buigs yett nor many FPS issues like some. Gameplay wise, the game feels great! Its a Far Cry mixed with CoD feel. I love Far Cry and I like the fast paced gunplay that CoD brings to this game. Also, the gun customization is amazing! Feels great and is a lot of fun to make different combos with the weapons! This game is a solid 7/10 for me! With some patches maybe even higher! Still waiting on the Day 1 patch though!
2148	Lack luster game play, poor character development, and clunky game mechanics.   I was very excited about this game only to be severely disappointed. Good luck driving the motorcycle...
2149	The game isn't that bad, but the technical issues does make it a pain to play. The game is basically FarCry in an urban environment, and I like it just as much. However, the technical issues does take me out of it some what.  The game lacks polish, and it shows. When you climb over objects, your camera snaps in a weird angle after climbing over the ledge, not at all smooth like Dying Light or FarCry. Sometimes when you reload the magazine moves faster than your gun which creates a hilarious effect of you using the Force to reload. There's still plenty of other technical problems, such as the stuttering and graphical anomalies, but these were the little things that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ me off the most (for whatever reason). All it takes is an NPC's mouth moving slightly off sync from the voice to take you out of a game, and it only gets worse when there's a lot of little things nagging at you at once.  Maybe wait for a patch before buying, but behind all technical issues lies a competant shooter. It isn't breaking any new ground, but If a competent shooter is all that you're looking for you might be pleasantly surprised.  If you want to play a similar game, like, RIGHT NOW, go buy FarCry 3/4. 
2150	5/10  Pros + Graphics + High tech drones + Weapon customisation  Cons - Visual glitches - Motorcycle control - BORING storyline
2151	11/10 Crossbow is the most powerful weapon in the game
2152	Alright, I'm not good at reviews, but I tried playing this game, and seeing all the reviews, I went in with low expectations. At first, the game was a bit good. From the start, the audio was unsynced, the framrate was dropping, and the controls just feels... clunky. In it's current state, I cannot recommend this game to anyone, not until they fix it.
2153	Well, I must admit it was a great concept, but once again, homefront has let me down. This game feels like it has literally no polish to it. The animation is pretty awful, charecters glitch out in cutscenes, Enemies pop out from nowhere, and these are only a couple problems I had with the game. The last straw for me was when it crashed for the fourth time. I immedietly requested a refund. Do not make my mistake and buy this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Again, great concept, horrible execution. This game is incredibly glitchy and buggy. I undermined other reviews blowing it off saying the bugs were a rare occurance and I probably wasn't going to encounter them. I was wrong, and requested a refund.  Final message: DO NOT GET THIS GAME   Rating: 4.9/10
2154	âIf you liked Crysis, you will Enjoy this Game. âIf you liked Far Cry, you will Enjoy this Game. -If you liked any Open World Game, you will either Hate or Enjoy this Game. -If you liked the First Homefront Game, you will either Hate or Enjoy this Game. âIf you like Games with Good Story and Characters, you will not Enjoy this Game. âIf you are bothered by a Few Bugs or Glitches, you will not Enjoy this Game.

2155	TL:DR: Game is clanky and buggy. Feels like it needs another 4 years of dev time. Some may like the game it's setting and atmosphere.   Non TL:DR  Out of any game that I have ever played at launch, few have been as buggy, clanky and awkward to play on mouse and keyboard than this game. After a bumbling tutorial filled with the deaths of several disposable characters, the game drops you into what should be the meat and potatoes of any game, but instead of shooty tooty goodness you receive one of the most bland and robotic shooters I have laid my hands on. If you like the series then this may be something you can force yourself through. If not, you may want to avoid it like the plague, praying that you don't catch what this game has.
2156	After few hours of playing I can recommend this game. I had a few visual bugs but nothing game breaking. It looks like the main issue for performances is that people do not know how to configure the settings. You can check two hours of my playing to confirm that on my twitch channel:  https://www.twitch.tv/mukumihfr/v/67938952   To come back to the game itself it's a nice mixture of FC / AC / Escape from LA. The gameplay is fun and easy to learn, the guns have a nice feelings. DO NOT FORGET TO TURN OFF AIM ASSIST else it'll be really bad. I only did the two first zones until now and I've been enjoying them.   I wouldn't recommend purchasing it at full price but if you can find it from 45â¬ and if your configuration can run it flawlessly (I personnaly use a 980ti + i7 5775c) then you will have fun. Of course you have to enjoy that type of game.   As for the graphisms critics, I guess that no one ever went to Philadelphia. Go check on Google Streetview. Once that you leave the center you arrive in those area where most of the houses are not recent. The work made on the city is really good and the game makes a nice representation of what Philadelphia looks like if it was invaded.  So not the best FPS of the world but a nice game anyway. 
2157	Amazing game, with awesome graphics and story. The game has a good weapon customization and a large variaty of options to chose from and the best part is that it is good optimised and it works for me on low settings with fluid movement and the graphics are still good.Is amazing how a 2016 game works on my old Intel i5 with decent graphics and fps. Good job.
2158	 FarCry in America.
2159	great idea, but in these days a good multiplayer is also just as importaint as the story. People enjoy competativeness and in this game there is none, you cap out at lv 6, I like the character customization, but what is the point if no ones playing? If you could take the character from the multi into story that would be nice.
2160	INFO:  -Intense, interesting single player campaign. -Multiplayer consists of various coop missions, independent of the campaign. -All optimization and framing issues I had-- outside of the opening cutscene-- were solved by adjusting the graphic settings to fit my system.   PROS:  -The game is difficult. It forces you to realize that you're not some COD badass, you're just some idiot with a gun and something to fight for. -The game areas change as you play. It's amazing to see this pro-KPA zone full of collaborators and such go and turn to rioting and uprising against the KPA because of your actions. -The guns feel real. They look heavy and slightly bulky because IRL they are heavy and bulky. You're character acts like they're heavy and bulky and this affects your ability to fight with them. -The strike areas and strongholds are each unique and different-- no one location mirrors the next. Sure, each relief center or whatever will have similar goals to capture it, but the layouts between them make each location unique. -The journal entries and other textual documents are actually really interesting and fill in a lot of the backstory. -The open world is legitimately open. You have your missions, but there are numerous side objectives to make your journey easier. Even how you complete your objective is up to you. For example, if the game wants me to capture a stronghold, I have a couple options. Do I use my RC car, attach a hacking device to it and hack open the gate? Do I set charges on cooling vents and blow a hole in the wall? Do I grab a motorcycle, find a ramp and jump the wall? Once I'm inside, do I go COD style, pull out my LMG and mow everyone down, or do I move quietly through, killing when I have to and biding my time? Of course there are many more options than this, but you get the idea. To be honest, different areas require different methods to succeed.   CONS: -Occasionally during scripted scenes, and especially during the opening scene, the audio won't match up with the video. It's more annoying than anything else. -The 'Hearts and Minds' missions are fairly repetitive. These missions are where you're trying to get the people in one of the zones to rise up and fight the KPA. The results of the missions are generally different, but the mission itself is the same. -The motorcycles and RC cars are difficult to navigate. The accelerate too quickly and get stuck really easily.  -Once you get into your rhythm with your weapons, there's no need to buy the others. This can happen fairly early on in the game. -The AI is sometimes inconsistent, i.e. when they'll spot you and when they won't, etc etc.
2161	This feels like far cry 4 minus a reason to exist.
2162	Buggy, glitchy mess. Do not buy.
2163	I am enjoying this game very much actually. I have a gtx 970 and had to turn a few things from ultra to high, but it runs smoothly for me. Graphics are great, aside from the dated looking npcs. The world is immersive af. Gunplay feels very gritty with every bullet that hits an enemy making them jolt. Story kinda sucks so far, but you love to hate the enemy in this game, thus wanting to just go around and take out every post of theirs. I should also note that this game is NOT easy. You die quickly and guns have quite a bit of recoil. Cover is a must, and you must always watch your back, because although the AI can be dumb af sometimes, it also will flank and get a nice surround on you. But it is a good and welcome challenge, unlike Farcry where you just blow everything up and then wingsuit away like â¥â¥â¥â¥in batman.  It must be noted though that there are numerous SOUND glitches, with some physical bugs as well. But the sound glitches are pretty bad at times.   But if you can get over the bugs, which is totally possible with this game, and want a farcry game but with that feeling like you are actually making a difference along the way, then don't let the negative reviews turn you away. Just make sure you have a good rig, because it is demanding.
2164	  Terrible game. Ridden with bugs like problems with the sounds of shots, unresponsive enemies, NPCs getting stuck, etc. Enemies will respawn almost immediately after being killed, replace their fallen friends, and resume whatever activity the previous soldier had, while his body lies at the new guard's feet.   Additionaly, very simple crafting and resource/inventory management, low variety of weapons, and gameplay is very similar to that of Far Cry - but worse, and even more repetitive.   Besides, I gotta be honest. I don't really like unrealistic games where you get to kill a LOT of people single handedly.
2165	It has nice graphics but the gameplay is not that good... Choppy animations,bad plot and awful optimization..
2166	I would have refunded it. (Free Weekend)
2167	  Those puzzles require when capturing outposts/watchpoints ruined all those gaming experiences.
2168	Don't even waste your time downlaoding this game for the free to play weekend.
2169	Kinda sucks  The story hooked me for like thirty minutes, then the framerate dropped. Played like an hour, then got a refund.
2170	Got it release day, still cant play it. Have GTX 670 SLI and even on lowest settings max i get is 45FPS. And i can play Battlefield 4 on High settings around 110FPS, and Crysis 3 on Medium to HIgh settings around 80FPS.
2171	I don't knw why ppl are complaining about this game.  But for me, this game is awesome.
2172	lags heaps and not much to the weapons
2173	FIRST OF ALL EVEN THOUGH I SAID DONT BUY THIS GAME I DID THAT SO I GOT YOUR ATTENTION So I wanna start with saying that the idea of this game was very good, the graphics were really good with certain places and lightings, guns were cool and mission fun. However this game had a lot of glitches when it comes to driving motorcycles, fighting enemies, and a lot of other things. and also, i still have a ton of questions like (SPOILER) why Ethan doesnt talk, what happend to sam the doctor and much more. And btw, ai isn't that good, people run away and get stuck, and so much more things are buggy, multiplayer is not ok, I have the newest HP Phoenix with WIRED network and can't find any matches, upgrades are easy to get since you get a fortune for everything you do. I expected more out of the 'open world' thing they said it was, but instead, after you completed the game (which is completed in 15 hours with everything you can and may do) you get back to the homescreen. I also expected a lot more options in upgrading and techniques for brady. so in conclusion, Is the game worth buying?: yes, but only on steam sales. Is this game enjoyable?: Yes but do know that the ending is the worst. and the biggest question of this game is: Game director, did it really take you 4 YEARS for this short story?
2174	This game IS ABSOLUTE GARBAGE!!! I couldn't even play the game because of how bad the audio is. Every single sound effect was a bare minimum of 10-15 seconds after the action would occur...
2175	So let me go ahead and say I'm not going to reveal any spoilers.  Homefront: The Revolution could have been a great game. It's definitely single player/co-op based. The original Homefront was a huge let down. This was exactly an on par performance. At least in the beggining. Then came the game breaking bugs. Like you can't select the RC car on PC if you don't have all of the modifications unlocked for that type of 'grenade' unless you have a controller. Then lets move on to these zones you're supposed to clear. You'll get snipers who won't show themselves so you can't kill them or no enemy NPC in the actuall area but all over the damn streets. All in all it's pretty bad. Last but not least this game follows that FarCry and Assasins Creed gameplay. The gun customization is pretty neat until you realize hey why the hell can't I suppress my M4 or why can't I put a suppressor on just about everthing that's decent. Instead of making a SMG class you get stuck with making your pistol a SMG. I always like my pistols seperate from my SMGs. The game feels lazy and the fact it's been out this long and still has issues shows me pure laziness by the developtment team. It's sad the game has a typical hollywood story but I'm just here to shoot up some commie DPRK plebs so I can give two giggles about the story. Still though half the time I spend in this game I'm sneaking trying to avoid the 'NORKS' as they call them in game. This game should have been called Splinter Cell Herp-a-derp edition. Also there's a 50bmg in the game with the range of about 60 meters so it has that going for it lmfao.
2176	Idiotic and cliche plot\characters. Disguisting and awkward gunplay. Don't recommend it even for free.
2177	the worst purchase I've ever done on steam
2178	So far I love this game. The setting attracted me at first, but people said this game is buggy and lame. For me, this game did its best in the story, at least. Other than the bug issue and repeating elements, it is one of my favourite game so far in 2016. Although the shooting isn't as good as common FPS, as I said, the story did cover it. Also it is a sandbox game so I can enjoy shooting Norks or sneaking around like a ghost.  Pros -Attractive setting -Sandbox with enough elements -Converting different weapons -Shooting Norks  Cons -Drops of fps in some places -Shooting is not as great as common FPS -Some repeating elements  Buy it, but you can wait for steam sales
2179	Its a really good idea with poor day 1 tech issues on low end rigs. Being a PC enthusiast and having a monster of a PC I have only experience a few minor graphical glitches in 6+ hours. I did drop below 60 fps (my monitor is a 144hz monitor) a few times but remained in the solid 85fps area through most of gameplay.  When you complete a Side Job like take a picture of the police station you will notice a quick lag spike as the game awards you your money and auto saves, but mostly smooth sailing.  The only actual non-technical gameplay complaint I have is the automatic weapons in the game seem underwhelming while any single shot weapon (except the starter pistol) are great. When you upgrade the starter pistol to a SMG that is the only automatic weapon in the game that feels crisp. The AR and LMG variant act slow and are very inacurate. The Battlerifle and Crossbow seem to be where it is at so far.  I would recommend this game if you like the story idea as it puts you right in the feel of the game. Personally I enjoyed the original in all aspects. The open area idea in this one is good and I hope they can flesh it out someday in a true sequel as they have some good ideas here.
2180	ALT+F4/10
2181	it's a fun game, feels pretty clunky at times with a cover system that works 50% of the time  Runs perfect on 650Ti Boost, all on Very High with 40+ FPS. Meanwhile it won't even boot on a 960 
2182	Its okay it is very frustrating and a bit stupid that i can fall 4 metres and die and take 20 bullets. I do love this game very much and do recommend it if u like fuctaristic games and a bit of war. I would love to say if you hate North Korea well this game you can burn them and shott them and tourcher them. If you like gurrila games this is your choice oh and you will need a fast pc i have 32gb ram with a itel i5 4700k and it can some times have frame drop and the ram is hyper x  I enjoyed this game with a issus and bugs but its playable hope you enjoy it&gt; 
2183	I keep freaking out becuase everytime im hiding from the KPA they seem to see me through the walls and then thay shoot the wall

2185	This game sucks almost as bad as the first one
2186	Nothing like the first game. Not very good at all really. more like a grindy GTA feel then a decent shooter.
2187	I really tried to like it. I fell in love with the first one when it came out and the first one got me questioning what extremes will everyone be willing to go to. But this game???? it shouldnât be considered a sequel, why??? well the first one set a good tone from the beginning with the economy going downhill and North Korea discovering it's become a powerhouse by uniting with South Korea. The story for me went downhill when they changed the introduction to the game to the US buying too much into Korean tech and to pile the economy on top of that, rather than the nation rising up and becoming a real threat. So ok I took a deep breath and started playing this hot mess. I am running 2 980m's and even with setting the GPU to single performance the game is just horrible. The shooting feels off, the AI cracks me up and yes it feels more like a Farcry game than something special. The characters are interesting but that is about it. This game is more like worth 20 buck, I paid 30 bucks on amazon for a hard copy of the game and after playing it I felt like I spent too much money on it. The game itself is not unplayable but itâs not worth anything over 20 bucks in my opinion.
2188	its really good but yea,dont buy if u want to play multiplayer without friend(hard to find player in multiplayer)im playing homefront from PS4
2189	Normally I enjoy playing through clichÃ© run-and-gun murder simulators but this game is more painful than passing a kidney stone. Regretfully, you can't refund gifts.  I sincerely hope whoever is responsible for managing this game never tries to dip their dirty fingers into the gaming industry again.
2190	Great gameplay, nice storylin. Pretty good overall

2192	I just downloaded the game as it's free for the weekend....however after 15-20 minutes I've quit and now I am deleting this peice of s**t! Poor optimisation, graphics aren't that good, but the worst part is the gameplay...tons of cutscenes(that you can't just pass) not much of action and cheesy line from the characters....I woudn't take this game even if it was free!
2193	  It's really bad just like the reviews say, It should be 10-5 euro's or a free to play... But what it costs rightnow and how the game feels and plays it's one of those failed free to play games..
2194	Nothing like the first game. Not very good at all really. more like a grindy GTA feel then a decent shooter.
2195	Really not a fun game. I loved the storyline of the first one. This one sadly disappoints on story and gameplay.
2196	Really not a fun game. I loved the storyline of the first one. This one sadly disappoints on story and gameplay.
2197	  It's really bad just like the reviews say, It should be 10-5 euro's or a free to play... But what it costs rightnow and how the game feels and plays it's one of those failed free to play games..
2198	Beginning seemed interesting, but the open world concept is already boring in a few minutes.
2199	Besides the story and concept being dumb as hell, it's an okay shooter albeit a technical mess.   It's a shame Crytek UK couldn't finish what could have been a more stable finished product than what Dambuster churned out.
2200	jfc,, this wes,,,,,, really bad. its not worth it. please. save yourself. the movement is buggy, you get stuck on low hanging ceilings if you have to crouch. the ai is,,,,,,, bad. I dont see the appeal, they dont shoot at you if you are far enough away, but once they are close they are pretty decent but they seem a bit omniciant at close ranges. Stealth takedowns arent actually stealth, all nearby enemies are alerted. Eventually i ended up refunding it because i got stuck and respawned into the same location from where i was stuck. and to clarify, not stuck as in couldnt beat it, stuck as in could not move. I dont want to sound too negative and i did have some fun but, if you look at this game too close it falls apart. if you are into this kind of game its worth it, but its hard to reccomend with the game feeling broken, like with the buggy movement. its too easy to get stuck and then it forces you to reload from the most recent checkpoint.
2201	They really screwed themselves with this. Sad really. For reasons, read the hundreds of other reviews out there. Gonna give this a big thumbs down.
2202	A stupid game. Can't really immerse in the game. The shooting system sucks. The plot isn't great as well. Do not buy this game at any price.
2203	Feels like a crappier farcry.
2204	1080p Titan x - 4790k both Oc and on water - with 32gb of sram and ssd . GAME RUNS LIKE SH**T did i mention im using gsync even that cant help this stutterfest crap. Frame rates jump from 80s to 30's and even if your getting high framerates the frametime is all messed.  On the plus side game looks nice good graphics.
2205	It isn't bad, neither is it a fantastic game. I am currently enjoying it and i'd imagine if you like a dumb open-environment shooter like recent Farcry titles it'll be fun for you. People are complainning about bugs and whatnot, however, I personally haven't seen any myself. I think the game will just get better with post-launch patches, if you are not convinced that the game is worth it take a few weeks to wait till' more reviews are released.
2206	I mean it is a pretty fun game all in all i can say i will enjoy playing it in the future but as of right now with all the screen tearing it is kind of unplayable at the moment. Again it is fun, the start of the game when less in really going on it runs pretty smooth but the power of a gtx 980ti should be able to run this game easy. I am hopeing in the near future they fix these small bugs to make it run smoother. Also the 80$ version of this game is on sale on bundle stars for 47.93 so why not go check that out while you can!
2207	Just a disclaimer, I've had no performance issues whatsoever. I can't comment on the lack of optimization or anything like that because that's just not happening to me.  With that being said, this feels like a pretty solid game.  First, the gunplay is delicious. When you pop off the perfect headshot, it feels oh so satisfying, and the takedown animations are crisp and pretty brutal. I like it. The gunplay reminds me quite a bit of Far Cry 3 and 4, so if that's your thing, you'll love it.  From what I can see so far, the open world is pretty solid, too. There's plenty to do and plenty to collect, so it seems like if you complete the main campaign there's gonna be quite a bit for you to do after. It's less than other classic modern open world titles like the Elder Scrolls series or GTA, but there's quite a bit of content here in this world, probably around the level of say Sleeping Dogs.  With that being said, there are a few negatives, specifically a really weak story. The original Homefront's set up for the invasion made a lot more sense, and even that backstory was a tough pill to swallow. The atmosphere the game sets up, especially when it's night time, in the suburbs of Philadelphia of occupation is pretty nice, but when you enter a redzone that tension goes away. The characters are also pretty B+ too and the main story missions are subpar. However, the gameplay makes traveling to them nice.  All in all, it's a solid game. Do I give it a 10/10? No, but I'm having a lot of fun with it. I hear that if you have a PC that's a few years old it won't be able to run it, though, so just keep that in mind.  If it goes on sale for 40$ this summer, get it. I'm having fun with it and if you are lucky enough to have a PC that can run it, you probably will too.
2208	Minus a few performance issues this is a really enjoyable game. Better than the first one. Hopefully they release a patch soon to fix perforomance stuff like lagging every now an them.
2209	Part Fary Cry 4, part dying light.   So far, my only regret was not starting on easy mode. The game is hard. Or i suck. No, it is hard.  The game plays fine on my system (gtx 780 4gig, i4770k). Solid 60 frames with everything cranked up.  The only time the game hitches for me is when i complete a mission or get a new one. Even when it does, it is brief and doesn't affect gameplay.  Fun so far, it has my attention where doom does not.
2210	Nice graphics and story line. Definately recommended for those who played Homefront before.
2211	I do not know what people are talking about with half this negitive reviews. The game has a few bugs that I have found but nothing extremly bad or game breaking. Did not really have a fps problem and I played the game on ultimate setting. I bet that because I am not trying play the game on a potato. The story is good even if the ending was a little on the WTF. It really did make you feel like you where fighting an uphill battle. Plus the opening video was so bad it good. USA buys tech from North Korea and keeps buying tell the USA is trillions of dollars in debt to North Korea.   My biggest problem was the world. Where it was kinda open world. Sadly once you do a few mission in that zone. You leave the zone and unless it one of 2 zone you will never go back again. The large amount of friendly npc and the lack of enemy npc breaks the immusion on the oppressive North Korea part. Also I hate the crappy crapy hacking mini game.  I think the game is good. I felt I got my money worth from it but you might just want to wait for it to go on sell. Which this is a shocker for me. I rarely feel I get my money worth out of a game. It is even more so it rare for me to even like a game. I feel to many games are just piles of â¥â¥â¥â¥.  The game takes some of the better elements of Farcry. Then gives you the ability to carry 9 guns. Half of them suck but once you upgrade a few you get some great fps gameplay.
2212	DISCLAIMER:I'M GIVING THIS GAME A REVIEW ON HOW I THINK PEOPLE ARE JUDGING THE GAME INCORRECTLY IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A REVIEW ON GAME MECHANICS YOU HAVE COME TO THE WRONG PLACE,although it can't hurt to gush about the gameplay a little. (please disregard spelling and punctuation errors for I am a mear child who knows not of grammar.)  I was so happy when this game came out,'finally something to do beside play csgo and wait for borderlands 3'.Having been disapointed by battborn this was my last hope to not die of boredom.So I say is homefront worth the price,yes.I look at the reviews for this game and they have no description at all,this has happend three times this year and it's starting to get annoying.What am I talking about,false comparison, let me list off games that have gotten â¥â¥â¥â¥ because of this battleborn,doom beta,homefront,(SO FAR) as to why this is happening I have no idea but reviews have been ruining these games,for example battleborn was compared to overwatch which has nothing to do with overwatch what so ever same with the doom beta they said it was just a halo clone with call of duty elements ,HAS NOTHING WHAT SO EVER TO DO WITH HALO OR CALL OF DUTY,the only thing similar is the suit that doom guy wears similar to the power armour worn by spartans in halo.Now moving on to the main topic,Homefront the Revolution some of the first reviews on the game were,STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS GAME or GAME IS A COPY OF THE DIVISION,again THE GAME HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS OTHER HORRIBLE TITLE DO NOT JUDGE THE GAME OFF OF THESE HALF BAKED REVIEWS THAT HAVE NO MEANING WHAT SO EVER.I said I wouldn't talk about gameplay but I am since I have to mension some of these amazing features.First off story I say it has a intresting plot with decent voice acting and you can really see how the story unfoldes.I FROGOT TO MENSION THE GAME DOES START OUT SLOW but after the 5th or so mission the game really starts to dig deep.Gameplay is well done it does something weird but it fits well,Homefront is the first game I know of that didn't have a completely broken cover system,the game gives you three options of attack,one is stealth with a very modified pressure pistol or you can take out your enemys with various tactics like explosive traps and various amounts of well animated takedowns.The second kind is all out guns blazing mayhem pipebombs molotoves and dragon breath shotgun fun.The third and my favorite is stratagey wich is any type of complex well strategy,example one of the missions has you hold off enemy forces for a extended amount of time so what I you could do was rid a motorcycle into a corridore of enemys jump off shoot a modified assault rifle rocket at it and wipe out a entire wave of enemys.Mensioned befor the motorcycle I WISH they would have included more of these into the game because IT WAS SO MUCH FUN,you could escape the enemy pursuing you by driving on rooftops to a safehouse by using ramps and slick moves WHICH WAS UTERLY AWSOME.This game has bugs I'm not afraid to admit that but it deserves a fighting chance and it even has a way to bypass the mediocre AI,this is a rare ocassion in games but if you put the game on the hardest difficulty it becomes a million times better with you now running to cover from every threat that can potensially 5-6 shot you resources are hard to come by so you will be using every tactic in the books from stealth to strategy to mayhem as you work your way up to become the most feared freedom fighter to take back philadelphia I give this game a 8/10 great mechanics and great game.
2213	Short play time so far but runs great for me with an i7 920, GTX 960 and 8Gb RAM, yep an old machine but still going strong and have no issues with performance. Gameplay, from the little I've currently played, is looking good and hadn't seen any huge issues with AI. So far I like it.
2214	Ok so i'm not far in to the game yet but i feel inclined to recommend with caution. Doesn't seem yet like it's worth the pricetag but deep silver has done some great work, so i have hope. If you're really eager to spend money supporting an american revolution, i suggest giving your 60 bucks to Wolf PAC.  It's basically 'Far Cry: Neo American Revolution' from what i've seen thusfar. It's hard to tell at this point what depth the game will have. It seems like it has sort of that 'nothing you do really matters' feel that saints row games have. So for now until i have time to spend time playing the game, i'd advise holding off until it goes on sale unless you love FPS openworlds like Far Cry.
2215	I was on the fence about buying this game but Im glad I did. If you enjoy farcry-esq sandbox shooters you will like this game. Its certainly not the most polished next gen game to come out this year but its definitely worth a try.
2216	Open world first personshooter Great idea love it. so far gameplay yea has a few lag spikes and story is really really thought out. dont base the game on the negative reviews alot of them are because of graphics and their failure to realixe no game is perfect. the first Homefront the campaign was phenominal the multiplayer Meh! this Homefront the campaign seems great so far the multiplayer which is a coop scenario deal isn't bad but great either very little selection and seems like a long grind. The only problem i see with this game is the very small variety of weapons and coop capabilty. I definitely reccomend this game for the single player not soo much the coop.
2217	Game is exactly what I was expecting The Division to be. Lots of good progression, guns and the mods for them are great. Fun to retake the city.  10/10 - Far Cry: Philadelphia.
2218	Got high end pc config and got fps problems  Monitor 144hz 1ms i5 6600k to 3.9ghz oc ripjaws 16gb ram 3200mhz gpu 980ti msi oc 6gb
2219	great game, there are a few glitches like a man sitting in the air and a begger 10m. under the road but its not game breaking glitches
2220	I don't know why everyone is complaining about glitches and graphics. This game runs great on my machine and I have a GTX660. Sure I had to lower graphics quality a bit but that's expected with newer games these days. The graphics still look great and it runs smooth on my machine. I'm hooked on this game too. I haven't played the previous Homefront game because I heard the storyline was short and I like playing singleplayer games. I'm not much into multiplayer considering all I come across are cheaters who think aimbots are fun for some reason. Battlefield 3 was the last frustrating multiplayer game i played. Anyway! This game is challenging and sure the storyline is simple but I love the combat, the equipment upgrading and taking back areas of the map with other NPC's as you just recruit random guys to fight next to you. I'm loving every bit of this game right now. Okay no more wasting time writing reviews. I'm going to go play Homefront: The Revolution. 10/10
2221	No home. No front.Not even no Revolution.  Horrible frame drop. Very foolish A.I. Empty open world map.  DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF â¥â¥â¥â¥.
2222	I don't seem to be having too many framerate issues with the game, and honestly, the game doesn't even look that bad on its lowest settings, so even if I did, I wouldn't have an issue with running it on low. Other than the framerate issues, the game is basically urban far cry, honestly. Nothing all that new added to the formula, just get in and kill some baddies. I enjoy the grind, but I know a lot of people won't, so there's your warning. The game is rather grindy.
2223	Adding Dead Island Cancer to other games.   WOOF WOOF WOOF.
2224	This is more matter of opinion especially ruling over the pros and cons. So far the game is amazing although I played the first one, this is definitely a step up. I personally don't have too much of a problem with this and would recommend it the second someone asks 'Jimmy. Should I buy this game' I'd say yes because gameplay with this game is amazing and with friends is definitely even more fun. This isn't a professional review but for the standard gamer like myself, this game is pretty well done in my personal opinion.
2225	I honestly don't see why people are claiming this game is complete garbage. 70 minutes into and I have yet to have any hickups or frame rate drops...
2226	The only thing that sucks is the complete lack of jawns.
2227	This game is really good and I have 970m no lagging and pretty cool .I waiting for this game very long .By the way I will recommend Asus for gaming and my experience.I learn computer since 2006 the best gaming for asus mother board why I am from South east asia country it is really hot like over 100 'F every day , Asus mother board never gets error.Thanks and if you see something is wrong feel free to tell me ,we can share knowledge eachother.Warmly Welcome for all people.

2229	Not the worst game out there... Don't see what the fuzz is all about. Video added below so people can see what I mean. Yes I read the issues people had, but I haven't experienced these issues what so ever.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKzJ3-mVG08&amp;index=1&amp;list=PLPxxdcb86ZHz002Q0-Ek73_NjyAluok39 
2230	This game is worth getting and please don't listen to the trolls that says 'i have a GTX980Ti (or Titan X) and this game is so buggy i am getting frame drops to 30 fps' cause really that is a lot of crap cause for me i am using a GTX 950 playing on max settings with motion blur off getting roughly 55-60 fps.  Tried out the coop story like mode and that is fun as well and gets a little challenging also got to remind people when you go down that they can revive you because 1 or 2 random people i would play with would keep on running and not really notice they would get more experience and cash for helping out.  So if you were to ask me personally if the game is worh getting id say yes cause for people that would enjoy something that is hard and has puzzles and prefers a good challenge this is your kind of game and before i forget to mention when the others are talking about bad voice acting they did their reviews only a hour into the game which is mainly the introduction on what to do so of course it would look a little bad with the acting but the futher you get into the game you can see that is keeps getting better and better.  Lastly i would like to mention as well for people that played games such as Sleeping Dogs, Just Cause, Farcry and Saints Row the start of all those games are a little boring but the more you play the more fun it gets and the story gets more interesting as you progress oh ya and my 22 hours on record is mainly 16 hours in the story 6 hours for the online coop mode.  UPDATE: The ending to the game is actualy really good, a little sad well for the moment in the game cause of attachments you will make in the game but it is still good and i do see replayablity in the game if you want to change things up, go a little more stealth or go out with a big bang all in all i have no regrets buying this game as i see it is 100% worth buying.
2231	I have to admit, this game wasn't as bad as many of the reviews said it was. Goes to show you can't trust any reviews except your own. However, this game wasn't for me as it probably was for many other players. Although I only played the game for approximately two hours, here's my opinion on how well Homefront: The Revolution did in standard categories.   Some notes to keep in mind: -Average shooter skills -Played on hardest difficulty -Avid FPS player -Average system spec (i7 4790k, GTX 660TI, 16GB 1866MHz ram)  Now onto the review...  Graphics: 7.5/12 The graphics are what you would expect from a CryEngine game, it is definitely higher end than most games. The city looks very realistic and almost Division-like although it has a more scanty and poverty driven erosion rather than abandonment. Rain and water on the ground reflected somewhat accurately albeit I see random white spots in buildings indicating small puddles, even when it was night time. Graphical glitches are present like many people have seen; so far I have seen enemies caught halfway between walls when they die, friendly AIs with no guns, and quite frequently a floating dead drone. Overall, the graphics was not the problem for me, even with those funny glitches.  Audio: 2.79/5.58 Sound tracks were okay, but the voice acting wasn't very smooth and there were many bugs with my playthrough. If you press esc or alt tab while an npc was speaking, their speech was gone completely. Only the animation would remain. Not even the subtitles would continue if the speech disappeared. You would think the sounds of the weapons would be closer to the real thing, afterall we live in 2016 and effects are pretty accurate and realistic nowadays. Instead, this game chose to focus on its cutting edge graphics and just kind of toss the audio in the blender and hoped it mixed well, which it didn't.  Performance: wtfwhy/2 Why did the developers decide to waste money on denuvo? Dunno, but one thing I do know is that wherever Denuvo is, performance issues will come. It takes a moderately high to high end pc to continuously run this game at 60fps. For me, the game only took a dip to about 35-40 FPS but that was still enough to make the shoddy gunplay in this shooter somewhat hard to control even with controlled single shots from a decked out assault rifle. Changing settings didn't do anything: I restarted the game with low, medium, and high settings (minus AA and VSync for all of them) and didn't see any change in FPS. The controls were somewhat easy to understand but not as customizable as you may think. Only the basics were allowed to be changed, however things like replacing the holster button to something more convenient than 0 (zero) was not possible because it wasn't even in the keybindings.  AI/Difficulty: lol/420 Enemies and allies were all hit or miss on the hardest setting. There's a 50% chance you run into a convoy that does the right thing and defends it with their lives, taking cover and moving up when neccessary. The other 50% you have either every KPA in the block and their mothers bumrushing you as they spawn close by or wall huggers. Yes, wallhuggers. Doesn't even matter if they are shocktroopers, assaults, or even vehicles. They will pick a wall, they will run to that wall, and they will hug that wall. Outside of skirmishes when its time for stealth, you can't rely on your pistol because they won't go down with a single headshot. Takedowns are reliable but the stealth mechanics in this game makes it so easy to be spotted unless you are taking a lone soldier down. On the hardest setting I managed to secure all of the first zone when you are ambushing a convoy by just taking cover and popping headshots which you should be doing anyways, cause ammo is limited. Given the fact that Dambuster guaranteed Dark Souls-like difficulty... can't say they properly did that because the AI is bad.  Overall: meh/5 This game is okay; it isn't as good as Far Cry 3 or Crysis, but it is a hell of a lot better than the first Homefront. Weapon customization was a big plus, story was also much better as you aren't stuck with the same 3 â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s the entire game, and just being able to freely choose if you want to gather materials or do missions makes this game a whole lot better than what I expected. However, in my opinion Homefront: The Revolution doesn't make the cut with triple AAA games... You can't just slap the words CryEngine on a game and then expect people to pay $60, we want more than just graphics. Not only that, but to take away the multiplayer PVP and then leaving only COOP was a bad idea. If this game was released at $30 then maybe I might have bought it, but for now I'm taking my $60 and going to Overwatch
2232	At 100% lived up to expectations !!!
2233	I just started, passed several checkpoints and it looks like good game.
2234	Korean war, part two, this time merica is the guerillas.
2235	I've only played about an hour, but I can't take any more. This game gets all the small things wrong, and they pile up to make for an absolutely infuriating experience.  Controlling the game is a nightmare. The mouse smoothing is crazy strong - I know it can be turned off in .ini files, but that's not acceptable in 2016. The guns feel like Nerf guns (although at least they're Nerf guns that actually kill people, at least in the intro levels I played) - no recoil, poor sound effects. Driving a motorcycle is quite possibly the worst driving experience I've ever had in a video game: it controls exactly like walking, just faster. Why does an over-the-top action shooter have a handbrake control if it doesn't let you drift around corners and you stop within a second of letting off the gas anyway? Oh, and the first time I tried to get *off* a motorcycle, I was magically catapulted 50 feet into the air and died on impact, so that was fun.  The sound is hilariously bad. I knew Yahtzee had complained about it, but I was still amazed by the terribleness. In one of the opening scenes, an important character (I know he's important because literally every NPC I've talked to can't shut up about how important he is) gets arrested on the street. According to the subtitles, he's yelling at the cops. All you can actually hear is the civilians, who are *all shouting the same line, one after another*. In a pre-rendered cutscene. Yeah.  The graphics... well, they're not exactly bad, but again, they're annoying in a lot of little ways. The motion blur is sickening (motion blur on moving the mouse? Who thought that was a good idea?). The lip-syncing isn't synced. The NPC animation quality is poor. Ground and wall textures leave something to be desired.  The setting is kind of cool, but that's not enough to redeem a game whose actual gameplay feels like a trip to the dentist.
2236	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this â¥â¥â¥â¥
2237	Took me 9 hours to realize i wasn't playing Farcry 3
2238	wow.... what a downgrade... AI is really dumb and the gameplay feels clunky and after many months i still have performance issues. Will not trust this dev again.,
2239	Crash,crash,bug,crash,can't load save file,crash.  Yep,pretty fun game so far :)
2240	This game is a Huge let down! now story wise its even worse than the original Homefront and beleive it or not the original Homefront was for more beliveable and Compelling of a story than This game. So story wise its horrible , what else? well for two its dialouge is god awful for example: first start up the game ' hey you've been with us for three days'( 20 minutes later through) ' hey man your your really expirenced' he's telling me as if i've been in the resistance for 5 years or something. #3 for an open world game this has the MOST linear mission gameplay i have ever played! I mean call of duty modern warfare 2 more than likely has less linear missions than this game! Well what about multiplayer? I remember the original Homefront multiplayer and that was actually pretty good, did they bring that back? well to answer your question......â¥â¥â¥â¥ NO! how dare you ask for that! you really expect us to put real effort into multiplayer! Why arn't you happy with this shity co-op mode we put in! to sum this game up, i doesn't deserve 1 thumbs down or 2, what this garrbage deserves it to be banned off the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing planet. I would rather play every single call of duty games singleplayer than even dare touch this game. So do your self a favor and refund this dog â¥â¥â¥â¥ and buy the original Homefront and/or Call of duty modern warfare 2 because those game had better multiplay modes and even a better singleplayer that actually makes sense( or at least more sense than this peice of â¥â¥â¥â¥)
2241	This game is still horribly broken, several months after it's initial release. Decided to give it a shot during the Steam free weekend.  Most egregiously the single player game has problems detecting when you've reached a checkpoint, and won't advance. During my first few hours with the game this was usually resolved by loading from the last autosave, but now I'm at the point where I'm stuck in a loop where the game will never advance.
2242	such a good concept but such a bad game
2243	DO NOT BUY. WILL NOT WORK PAST THE FRIST MISSION. NOW PATCH FIXES THIS. WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME.
2244	ROFL this game is legit bad. Can't even recommend downloading during the free trial.   Graphics are good tho and the gun customization but other than that. This game is AIDS
2245	I'll update this with more of a review, but it's pretty good.
2246	ROFL this game is legit bad. Can't even recommend downloading during the free trial.   Graphics are good tho and the gun customization but other than that. This game is AIDS
2247	I am not going to lie, but this game is good. Most of the reviews are bad beacsue they cant get 60fps on thier 980ti. I have dual 970s and it runs fine at 1440p.  The first thing i noticed is that the graphics are very good. The guns are good but the recoil is bad.   Story is nice, with the amazing, I repeat amazing guerrilla warefare. I mean you can hide in torn down houses or hideouts and ambush a KPA patrol with anything, You get like 5 kills and then you have to run off before renforcements arrive.   You have safe houses and look out points that you can use to make use of your surroundings.   One thing i advice is that you use a Nvidia card. My mate has 2 380xs and only get 30fps with stuttring. This game is very hard to run, mainly becuase it is the same game engine used to run CRYSISS 3 !!!!!!  So dont be afaid to turn the graphics down, the game still looks good at medium settings, Just imagine the ps4 and xbox one.   Cons  There are some buggs where you see npcs walk through eachother.  i do recomend this game. For those with NVIDIA cards from 780 onwards.
2248	Had very high hopes. loved the last homefront. this game falls so short with its programing. Fallout 4 had less launch day bugs. first door i opened my hand went through it. unstable frame rate and i have the fury x. game looks horrible textures are bad. 0.4 hours into the game and im asking for a refund. DO NOT PURCHASE PLEASE.
2249	I haven't had any issues with game performance so far at all, and I have a system far from the best. Running FX 8350 CPU (OC only to 4.3), R9 270x gpu, 16 gb ram. That being said most of my settings are just on High, some a little more. I am also just running with most settings at high, and not pushing it too much yet.  Definitely has the Crysis feel to it graphically. Some of the texures could use improvement, but overall are well done.  The guns seem a bit clunky as others have mentioned. They are not bad, just not great. It does seem that you can steady all guns, even pistols which makes a big difference. I do love the ability to mod the hell out of the guns, this should hold some promise. This gives you the ability to change your strategy on the fly which can be a very good thing.  Voice acting I feel is passable. I would say maybe 10%-20% above par, but certainly didn't draw me in quite the way it could have. They make their point, but they don't give me an adrenalin rush of fight or flight.   My biggest annoyance so far, and there have been few, is that when you shoot the enemies, they just seem to absorb it. I personally would like to see them falter a bit, show something that I just nailed him. I want to know that they felt it, I want to know that they are hurting...maybe I ask too much.   Overall I think that I will enjoy it. I am curious as to the amount of play looting and crafting has on the game, but with an open world, I think I will have gotten my money worth. If I find glaring issues, I will ammend.    
2250	Note that at the time of this review I had only played the campaign and therefore this review will focus on that and no this will not have any spoliers in terms of actual story.  Pros: Good weapon customisation  Very good campaign in terms of detail and story  Runs reasonably well on my PC and only had a couple of drops during the campaign (I know that some people have had problems with fps drops)  The easy difficulty is not a I win option in terms of difficulty and still offers a good challenge.  The health system is very good and definitiely adds to the challenge of the game.  Mixed (Things that were good and bad)  Good overall background story although disappointed that it was changed from the story in the original Homefront but I understand why it happened.  Although free to explore in the zones, I thought it would be truely open world like GTA V and that it seems to feel linear even though you can take over strongholds etc.  The A.I aren't idiots but they are not exactly the sharpest tools in the box either.  Cons:  Last part of the game becomes linear and back to the original homefront and other FPS games  Use of the RC car is quite bad and can be troublesome on things such as stairs  Campaign is quite short but longer then the original. I completed this campaign in about 15 hours.  Overall rating: 63/100  Not going to win any awards but it is definitely better then the first Homefront. I would get it when it is on sale if you don't want to pay Â£40 for it.    
2251	So far from what I have played the game is a mixture of Infamous and METRO. I've not had any bugs and I'm having fun. The graphics are great environment doesn't really change too much but what can you expect to change in a city environment. The main qualities are there and thats all I've asked for.
2252	Everyone is complaining about optimisation, but I've had little to no problems with frames, and all of this is patchable. The story is great for those who liked the first game, and the multiplayer ranking system/upgrading system is a lot of fun, but its hard to find people to play with sometimes, as its a new game and people are giving it too much hate.
2253	Constant stuttering making it incredibly frustrating to play. Became so frustrated despite trying on just about all settings uninstalled and requested refund. Couldn't change the keybinds on all actions. Wanted X as my crouch and it was stuck on ingame weapon custimizing...well it made me do both.   Couple patches in the future and it might be fixed/fine...now not worth it.
2254	Con: Decided to snipe some norks. Found some KPA soilders to snipe. When I blew off the head of one the other two instantly shot and killed me from 3 blocks away. Reloaded and tried again. This time the soilders didn't move as I shot their buddies one after another. Pro: Gave up sniping and started sneakinig around knifing people. Found out that Ethan is a ninja  I am actually having fun with this game. I am not a fan of the far cry or assassin's creed mission structure. Go clear out enemies and gain a portion of the map but I've played battlefield and COD games are worse. Its a good game to hold me over until blood and wine comes out on the 30th  7/10
2255	this game is ment for controller like really bad 
2256	Game was good, got a refund though.
2257	Love everything about this game!
2258	That wast of money on DRM helped this game a lot /s
2259	Bought this game in the 2016 winter sale &amp; i`m glad i did, Started the game up &amp; played the first section when your on foot, i would say a mini tutorial to the game, until i reached the underground in the erm underground. This is where the game took a turn for the worse, playing as a recruit for said underground you are expected to BUY weapons &amp; upgrades from items you pick up in game WTF. Then theres the vehicle controls, I mount the bike found in the container &amp; try to drive it to the next checkpoint, I hit every car, every bollard along the way because of the control scheme with no option to play in 3rd person that i could find. Graphics are ok but nothing special &amp; there is lag to contend with.  As i said i picked the game on sale including all DLC, I will go back &amp; play some more BUT not any time soon!
2260	With the release of the Performance patch I get 60 fps up to 120 on high/ultra system settings.  i5 cpu/ amd 480x gpu  gameplay wise if your looking for a fun open world shooter Homefront does deliver.  Occupied Philly is fun to explore and the game does make you feel like a guerrilla fighter.
2261	Homefront is apparently a franchise Iâve never heard of. According to some reviews, itâs not a direct sequel to anything. The story is pretty easy to follow, weâre treated with a short but sweet intro sequence that tells us that the North Koreans had been selling the USA technology for decadesâ¦ But when it came time to pay up, the US was in debt and collapsedâ¦ So they just moved right in and took over the country in payment. Since most of their tech was purchased from them, they were evidently able to shut down most, if not all defenses the US had. Honestly thatâs probably a better explanation than most military shooters these days. Homefront went back decades to set up the downfall rather than the quick âSuddenly the russians are hereâ or âsome PMC did a successful power-grab and owns ALL THE GUNSâ. At the very least, it does a good job of properly suspending my disbelief. The intro does a whole timeline starting from the 1970â²s with a voiceover describing how everything slowly went to hell for us during the next 50 years. Fair enough.  Reviews are âMixedâ, however most of them talk about bad optimization and how the game barely runsâ¦ That ceased to be an issue for me a couple months ago when I upgraded. As a result, Homefront runs fine. The occasional FPS drop, and even that went away once I tweaked my graphics settings - Most of which are on High (Though not on Very High).  Mechanically, the game has its ups and downs. Itâs a sort of psuedo-open world that is comparable to the Far Cry series. Indeed, one could sum this game up with âLike Far Cry? Play thisâ, because itâs the usual tower/base/zone control where you assault a stronghold or radio and that zone suddenly gets littered with resistance fighters, which in turn, helps you traverse the area a little more safely. I say âpsuedoâ because thereâs not a whole hell of a lot to do while running between base-controls. Every now and then a dynamic event pops up (Such as five snipers pinning down a squad), wherein you get some money and resources for completing it but theyâre skippable if you have your sights on a mission - which gives you a lot more money and resources.  Thereâs only one mechanic so far that I despise - Driving. There are bikes littered throughout the zones and sometimes you need to take it into a building and park it on a sort of wheel-generator, hold down forward for a bit to âchargeâ a generator, then youâve captured the base. The problem is, as it kind of was with Far Cry, is that vehicle driving in first person is a huge pain in the â¥â¥â¥. I tap D and it turns a full 45 degree angle when Iâm just trying to inch away from some rubble. At least Far Cry gave you a large open world with fields - This is Philadelphia. Thereâs rubble EVERYWHERE. In my six hours of gametime Iâve yet to go thirty feet without ramming straight into something. So I'm screwed if thereâs ever a mission where I have to drive one through a siege.  So far thatâs been my only source of annoyance. A less annoying but still irritating issue, some of the bases are hidden in buildings where you have to find a secret âentranceâ in order to get into it. Iâve had to resort to youtube and walkthroughs twice to directly point me to where I need to go because I once spent ten minutes circling a building and climbing around the stairs, only to find out there was some blue paint on a bookcase that I never even saw. I walked by that bookcase a dozen times but that damn paint was never in my field of vision. I also left a safehouse to be stuck in the âleavingâ animation, where a Korean shotgunner was right there unloading into me. Some safehouse, right? Beyond that, Iâve run into a couple of bugs but nothing has been directly gamebreaking, except one broken base that I canât controlâ¦ Hopefully restarting the game will have fixed that.  So Iâll just sum up with âLike Far Cry? Are you a 100%-er? Then you probably wonât mind this.â
2262	I've got no problems with this game yet and i'm loving it though the campain is a little short but still fun. Wish there was a multiplayer but the co-op is still fun
2263	So i put in about a good 2 1/2 almost 3 hours into Homefront: The Revolution and I am loving it, AI gets in the way from time to time blocking ur path, u should be able to walk through them it gets irritating but does not reflect my opinion of the game. the customizations of weapons on the fly is tremendous. Game gives gamers a choice u can make either to play stealthy or balls-to-the wall gun blazing. I had to turn down some of my graphics settings to improve frames. game is not optimized well, but I play video games more for the mechanics than graphics. even with that said I average 40-50 fps, turning down graphic settings. vehicle controls could of been done better, but are not horrendous. covering system is ok, storyline so far is great.   Overall, I would rate this game so far 8/10 due to not being optimized well or vehicle controls. I am having fun with the game but not being optimized correctly affects the performance of the game. I would not recommend thsis game to gamers that want eye candy graphics, but gamers that like storyline and the mechanics of game.
2264	As of this writing, Homefront is a glitchy mess with ridiculous performance issues - while it is playable, this level of neglect should not be tolerated or supported. If you really want to play it, despite its clunky mechanics and feverish, if not near-sociopathic endorsement of paranoid 'us versus them' mentality, give it a few months. Hopefully, it will have been patched into some reasonable condition by that point - but even then, it might not be worthwhile to endure Philly Alpha screaming 'GREAT JOB BRADY, THAT'LL GET THE PEOPLE BEHIND US' into your ear every time you murder another human being in broad daylight.
2265	So After playing abit of the optimizations patches and being able to play the game the way the game was intended to be played,It's not bad  Does it feel as polished and as fluid as a AAA game? No it doesn't but for the 40# price tag for someone who likes to play open world shooters it's fun.On that note the game is relatively slow paced at many moments and faster in others,and while the combat feels abit over bearing at times its easily passable even on the hardest difficult.I haven't even tried Co-Op due to the fact it's not open world,But overall its a breath of fresh air from what shooters are becoming.And while I do like this game most people don't and it's a shame it was released in such a bad state and got such a bad rep from that because if you actually play the game you would see it is a decent game   Overall i rate it a 7/10 due to some serious bugs and issues I've encountered with accidental wall breaches and sequence breaking with the story line
2266	GTX 980TI I7-6700K 4.00GHz 4.01GHz cant even run the lowest setting. WTF!
2267	this is 5 years of game development?? Seriously??? LMAO
2268	Love it!
2269	Its ok not great needs some work on the optimization front right next to the balance front so then it can be a good Homefront very punny am i
2270	So I made a review but for some reason it did not get posted and im to lazy to type it up again. So I will just shorten it up for every one yes the game has problems but if you can get past them i will say at least for me that I started it up at about 12:40 central time and before I knew it I had 8+hours in the game so I dont have a problem in my eyes if I get 6 hours or more im happy. I will also say that im near the end of the game but I rushed it and did almost no side stuff.  All in all just go buy it on â¥â¥â¥ or wait for a sale. on â¥â¥â¥ its like $30/$35 so yea i do enjoy it and tomorrow I will play more of the game and finish it and then write a full review of the game.  (never been good at english. also this is my 1st review well 2nd but the first one did not go through)  my rating 7/10  edit--------------------------------------------------------------  after finishing the game i will have to drop it down to around a 5/10 because when you finish the last mission you can not go back at all. 100%. you can not go back inless you start a new game ;( most open world games now days allow you to explore the world after you finish everything but nope not this one. so as soon as you see that msg that says after this you will no longer be able to do such and such just stop and go finish everything else before that. all in all I liked the game and im gona try coop tomorrow but I played a bit of it by my self in a privet match and liked it.
2271	Well two hours into the game I will say that the game is amazing. It runs perfect even when I'm recording with fraps. I can run it at max settings without problems. I must say that fps aren't constant 60 but my game is running around 50. Even with recording it runs verry good. There is a bit of a frame drop when exiting the shop.   I don't have anything bad to say about this game. I will say that graphics are amazing at max settings. The game is playable with good amount of fps. Shooting is a bit different not in a bad way but I got a feeling that hitbox is kinda small so you have to aim directly at enemy so its not like some Call of Duty where you shoot anywhere close to enemy and you will hit him. There is also big recoil when spraying but you get it under controll really fast. If you can't controll it there is an option in settings for aim assist. I would recommend this setting if you are playing with controller. I also noticed im some cutscenes that sound was a bit behind the actual scene but only for like a half of second or less.  I would recommend this game!  I saw a lot of people talking bad things about this game and how bad is their preformance and I also saw that they are saying that they have some SLI and Titan GPUs and they have problems running it. For me it is running PERFECT WITHOUT PROBLEMS so I really don't know what they are talking about.  Video(It is not benchmark or anything just normal walkthrough so skip first cutscene):  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84-5-kgiS5k   Specs: CPU: i7-4790 3.6GHz boost 4.0GHz (stock frequency) GPU: Radeon R9 290 Windforce - 4GB RAM: 12GB Corsair Vengeance 1600MHz MB: Gigabyte G1.Sniper Z97
2272	is this a game? all i see is unskippable cutscenes that go on for so long that even when i leave to go poop, IT'S STILL GOING when i get back.
2273	It's deffintly fun, at first. Starts out great but gets boring the more you get good at it. For example, all the vehicles have a big yellow spot that you can basically shoot with a pistol and blow them up..., and its trival to get away from the soldiers when they give up 30 seconds after you execute an official and the platoon that was guarding him. It pretty much starts out with an immersive gureilla fighter feel, but before long your wasting everything like any other shooter.  All that said though, it was a blast for about 10 hours before I started getting bored. I'd say its almost worth full price and for sure worth a buy on sale.
2274	I'm quite a fanboy when it comes to this series, if it can be called that, since there's only one other game in this series. BUT! It IS a good looking game; during the day. The night sucks. It's near impossible to see anything without flipping on the flashlight. Night becomes scary and unnecssarily difficult to navigate and fight in. Another thing is the frame issues. Every once in awhile there's a drop, or freeze for a second, but it bounces back. The weapons are a whole nother story. The weapons are awesome. Having a weapon for near every situation is great, and carrying one weapon means you're carrying three. (For instance, the pistol converts to an SMG or a silent Air pistol) Gear is seemingly unnecessarily tedious to get, but is useful, I just wish it could be upgraded even further. Weapon Upgrades really do make a difference as well. The Red Zone/Yellow Zone concept is also very novel, switching between zones that are all-out warfare, and zones that require stealth and stealthy killing is really fun, though it can be annoying. The story is near standard shoot-em-up war-games fps play, but that's okay, because it fits. I wouldn't recommend it at the price it is, but I'd definitely recomend it at 40 or lower.
2275	This game was just â¥â¥â¥â¥. Stuttering graphics and fps drops galore, not to mention screen tearing and tonnes of bugs.m 0/10
2276	No lag at all. using 970. No idea what people are talkin about eventhough theyve got better graphics cards than me! seems people tend to lie or either have a good graphics card and a bad pc all round.  8/10
2277	It seems as a nice game, I understand that its development was troubled and they had their share of problems, but you can see the love and dedication to it. I only played it for a small time, I think I will like what it will offer me ... but I will wait for a first patch.  But I liked what I saw, taking that motorbike jumping across the map dodging bullets seemed quite fun. Sound synchying issues, weird shadows, mixed speaking loudness, enemies spawning in front of you shooting ... not that fun XD  FPS controls seemed right, weapons had a punch, didn't like the mouse acceleration or something it had (didn't check control options for this first taste).  Oh ... and I really, really, really hope they let me kill Dana.
2278	in the beginning the game star with a very good flow and story, it look like a very good open world game, but after 2 or 3 hours everything became boring, same missions, same stories, everything like before, open world features are very weak, it seems to be open world but always you are bound in a small city. no car, no airplane, just walking, weaopens are good and funny.  just near the end again story find itself and became good with a very good ending.
2279	Almost 11 hours worth of story and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It played a lot like what little of the Assassin's Creed series I've played in regard to the capturing strikepoints and controlling more of each zone, while the rest of the game feels like Dying Light with less parkour.
2280	Great game!...Great environment!...Great gradual representation of urban chaos in motion!....Awesome MP!....An overall great story illustrating the good old American spirit of 'Red Dawn'!...It would be a mistake to miss the American way of resisting foreign invasion!!!
2281	I personally think for a game that has framerate issues and several bugs (mentioned below) , I actually enjoyed it! I wouldn't recommend this game to others unless the price comes down but definetly once the issues are addressed then definetly purchase this game! The singleplayer campaign could have been improved and the multiplayer could have been further developed (not just coop P vE) but even PVP i.e. KPA against the resistance.
2282	  Homefront bad.
2283	Full of bugs, mediocer graphics, story that doesn't really seem to exist, AI dumber than a piece of roadkill... I preordered this and was very excited, but got cold feet and refunded when prerelease previews were terrible. At the time of writing this review there is a freeplay weekend and after a few hours of playing I defintely made the right choice, I feel like playing this game for free was not worth while.  I did get a couple funny stories.   'Le Ethan Brady, sneak up on Korean soldiers in wartorn neighbor hood, 2 men and a camera drone. Shoot one soldier in face from five feet behind his friend with unsuppressed pistol'oh no his friend totally saw me blow his brains out!'   KPA Soldier: ... Ethan Brady: Hey buddy, I just shot your friends in the face, there is brains on your visor... also I'm not behind you anymore. KPA Soldier: ...  8/10 IGN'  *later*  'Le Ethan Brady, in Yellow zone. Lots of security, stay out of sight or else an army will hunt you down. See soldiers harrasing civilian. 'Ethan Brady will not stand for this!' draw shotgun and kill both of them. *ALARM* KPA soldier comes to investigate.  KPA: Hmm... two dead soldiers... one American soldier who looks like that murderer Ethan Brady I saw on TV... nothing suspcious here! Hrgkh!  Ethan Brady - knife fighter, assassin, stealth master supreme'
2284	Gasmestopper bug, cant advance the story. And I'm not going to start over which is the recommended 'fix'
2285	This is my review for Homefront: The Revolution - 2016  I would like to first say that I like this game alot however it's not the best game in the world. Homefront The Revolution brings a new first person shooter as you play as a resistance fighter, fighting the North Koreans as they have occupied the United States and basiclly you need to start a 'revolution' to take back your country.   What's the gameplay like?:-  I will be honest, it's very similer to Farcry 3 and 4. The gameplay is so much similer to it because the HUD setup is the same and the 'roleplaying' elements are similer to Farcry. You do need to earn money by doing jobs in the game to buy new weapons and upgrades. I mean I am not bothered with the gameplay much myself but at least it's something I am very familer with and others to.  What's the story like?:-  I will be honest, some people are right. The story is quite Mediocre (mixed) to people and I will agree. It's not really powerful but it does have it's intense moments in the game. The stroy in this game feels it's like a action-packed movie. I mean some of the characters are really good in it but it's not enough background story.   What are the graphics like?:-  The graphics are just the same as Farcry and other games abit. I have heard that people have had problems with the graphics and Fraps but to be honest with you I get some of those's issues that it does tend to go 'slow' but it does speed itself up. The graphics however like fire's blazing, explosions and world detail and the atmosphere are really good.   What other features are in the game?:-  I will be honest but there really isn't any other features much but the massive differences is from the first game is that this game is open-world. Another feauture you can do is indeed recruit resistance fighters to help you out on strongholds, police stations etc occupied by the Koreans but other then that there's no new features compared to other games. Not from what i've seen anyways.  How does this tie in to the first game?:-  I haven't really played much of the game but all I know is that this game does indeed tie into the first game but the only difference is that Homefront 2 is set in an alternative reality which means some of the events from the first game doesn't really exist anymore.   Final ratings:-  From my personal view. The game receives a favorable view from me. I will praise the visual effects, combat and the open-world features. however I am criticsizing the lack of story/backstory  Rating:- 7.1/10
2286	Noone actually is online on this game and the online is very bad.
2287	  takes 10 minutes before you can move the camera, takes 30 minutes before you can shoot.    all that time, and then it's a peice of â¥â¥â¥â¥.
2288	lots of bugs
2289	after completing the game twice , i can tell the game is alot to easy, and as for Fps and performance i cant really talk as i got an old rig running the game on low everywwhere but Hey! )0 lag :P ,   Pros: campaign have a fantastic map can get in most building , road trap are fun to use but i think there a need for more mobile squad so we have more opportunities to ambush them :D   gun mod are a must and is well made ,nice to switch from grenade launcher to LMG , one weapon is a fully arsenal i love it :D  story well the story is fictional so i think they should have taken fictional country as well i hate politic and stuff :P  Coop,its fun to be able to play fast game not running btw the mission , the A.I is being harder in coop so i still can have some fun even after i complete the story 2 time  cons:campaign i cant play the campaign with me friend (hoping for an update adding coop canpaign and harder difficulties)  the a.i are well made they dont always do the same thing but i would love to have some kind of command (like stay there /follow...)  having the silencer in coop for both sniper and assault rifle as well as the lmg , but not in campaing , even tho the campaign still easely doable having a silencer on some of the main weapon would have been fun, but i think they should not even be in coop   i will end my review by saying tkx to dev team for the good work they already put into this gem and i lil comment a harsh one but , truth must be said , fix it or the game going to die . but your reputation as dev team and the studio as well will take a hit
2290	I really just want to counter some of the bad reviews.... I have a modest video card (R9 200 series) and am playing on med. settings. Everything looks beautiful, the environment is very fun to navigate, the objectives are varied, the AI is fair, stealth works. I am playing with the difficulty notched up and find it challenging - it isn't possible to run into every situation with guns blazing (and survive). Planning, varied approaches, and tactics, is definitely necessary for each encounter. I have seen a few stutters, fell through the bottom of the earth once, and am a bit under-whelmed with 'hacking', but find nothing that has ruined the experience. I got the game with the 'Freedom Fighter Bundle' for mid $30 in April (from GMG)... 7 out of 10.
2291	  Love the game so far and it`s a lot of fun playing..   Spec: Intel core 17-6700 MSI GeForce Gtx970 4GB gaming CPI-E and more 
2292	I only played 30min of the game. 10 min of trying to get the setting right so it wasnt a laggy piece of crap. and even after i lowered them to the bare minumum to run the game (my computer meets the system requirements for this game). â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ port. not wasting my time unless they patch it to run better. at this point. dont waste your time.
2293	I love how they refused to make anymore Timesplitters games because of 'lack of interest' and then this new IP of theres flopped twice lmao
2294	this is a far cry 1 console port reskinned
2295	I have enjoyed and even been impressed with games that generally have been considered terrible before. This however is just awful.   Got a physical copy on a sale for around 10$, so I don't feel too bad. Fun to come back to every now and again just for a laugh.
2296	Been having fun taking back Philadelphia from the kpa! The weapons are so unqiue how they can be modded into 3 different types of weaponry. Graphics are gorgeous, I find my self just taking screenshots of the scenery and gameplay.   As for how many hours you can put into this game, I've got 68hrs and still haven't finished the main story line.Exploring and capturing all the kpa bases is so much fun to do, so alot of my time is spent in that.
2297	Why do I recommend this game?  Because it is honestly quite good. There is the issue of optimization, but that will soon be fixed and even with today's patch my FPS has increased. The game is really fun in my opinion and I only thought I'd play a short moment and then turn it off for the day, but then 2 hours later I was like 'Oh, uuppss!!' and decided it'd be best to continue playing for a bit longer.  I have myself feeling like I do not want to stop playing the game as it is just very fun for me. The singleplayer is solid and feels very fun and for me the FPS does not destroy my fun-factor.  The game does not deserve all of the hate it has been given and the 'Mixed' reviews is simply because of the optimization (which is going to be fixed).
2298	Apart from the well know technical issues i find the game to be enjoyable and a pleasant surprise. Pease sort out these tech issues though.
2299	this is the politically correct way to make a game about the second american revolution.........
2300	Crashed three times in twenty minutes.
2301	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ version of Farcry combined with every nationalists wet dream; fighting a second revolution against an enemy with slanty eyes. Offers nothing new. Boring.
2302	Poor man's Far Cry.
2303	This game is a pretty solid title.(No spoilers) Story: The story is great, it takes a different route from the original Homefront but it works. In this Homefront, NK is the most technologically advanced country in the world. We bought everything from phones to guns from them, but we did it with credit. Korea shuts everything off and forces us to pay our debt off with our country. You're part of the rebellion in Philidelphia, slowly becoming a hero while just trying to find an important man.  Action: The action gets a little repetative too quickly. I am a very creative person, especially while killing faceless NPC's. Either you molotov a patrol and drop the stragglers or you die... The APC's are stupid, three pipe bombs underneath it won't blow it up, but shooting it's gas tank once with a pistol will catch the whole thing on fire... Hacking anything besides doors is a joke. Drones stay hacked for 4 seconds, I only know that because I timed it. The weapon customization is the only thing holding the combat together, and that is saying a lot.   Multiplayer(Or the Co-op crapfest): If you don't have a friend or two, good luck. The co-op is actually pretty decent mechanically. A good character customization menu, where items look good cosmetically and are still useful. The community is the biggest killer. It is still early though, so when it goes on sale hopefully the community will broaden.   Graphics: The game is stunning, I run on high and get 60 fps without a single drop. It is very beautiful, even the reflection of a building on your gun will have you going 'Wow' like Eddy Wall. If you love clean,yet dirty graphics. This is a game for you.
2304	If you're ignorant and stupid, go jump in a pit.  This game is fantastic. Don't listen to all of the ignorant idiots who haven't even played it while they insist it's awful. The grapics are great, missions are randomized, gunplay is awesome, coop is amazing, sound effects are realistic, and it's a wonderful experience.
2305	I love this game. I have been waiting for it to come out for a very long time. The first person gameplay is not the best but to me it is smooth and enjoyable. The gameplay style changes in each zone, and it is fun to switch between shoot on sight and stealth every so often. I have a AMD R9200 series gaphics card and everything runs fine on high settings. Definition of 'Fine' : 50+ fps, high texture quality and no bugs experienced so far.
2306	Well I rarely write Reviews but since we apparently have found the whiners with the release of this title I figured I'd contribute! So this review goes out to the True gamers who have a custom Rig!   I haven't had any lag issues @ max settings on this game. No mystic black blocks appearing as someone mentioned. Audio is perfectly sync'd with mouth movements. Haven't tried online side yet as I like doing story first generally. A Glance @ my PC: Asus Crosshair V Formula-Z  AMD FX-9590  EVGA GTX 980 Ti Classified 32gb Corsair Vengeance Creative Recon3D audio 256gb Samsung 850 Evo SSD 3Tb WD Black 'Game is installed on this drive'
2307	F*%$ this Game
2308	Finished with the Game. Now for the review.  With all people say about it you may be inclined to think negatively as well, but this game, is a work of marvel.  Pros: Unique story True to the guerrilla way Feels like a revolution Awesome graphics Massive map Gun edit on the go Good multiplayer   Cons: Many, Many Glitches Some of the aforementioned glitches can hook story Shooting isn't very lively Frame rate drops when saving The realistic story removes action, for those action lovers, pass on it.   Basically speaking, the game takes a different route, and is definately worth playing, but if you think you'd rather wait till patches are made or you do not like games without much action, pass on it. After seeing the IGN review for this game I lost all respeck for IGN rreview system. They rate the game like its meant to be COD MW3 when it is it's own kind of unique.   P.s: if u get stuck in a part where a glitch gets you, remember if you go to story you can load a previous session 
2309	F*%$ this Game
2310	Repetitive, already done formula.  Really disappointed by this one... wish i saved the money
2311	Open world sand box fighting an oppresive futuristic enemy army on home turf, epic guerilla battles, tactical ambush points hitting the enemy soft spots in all out fire fights, sounds good right? Well some how it only comes across in bits and pieces with this game everything feels a bit slapped together part c fits in slot b game mechanics from the brief ammount of time I had with it this was the overwhelming impression I picked up. There is so much potential for fans of far cry style open world games you will constantly see something that piques your interest, that can grind out of you 'just one more base' but it never seems to go beyond the surface jenky gunplay and impossible to control movement constantly pull you out of the game. (you aim like a coked up orangutan, and move around the map like a coked up ice hockey player on jet skates.) that you will always have to goad your self to satiate that urge for just one more. The straw that broke the camels back for me wasd the co-op open world destruction with a friend? sign me right the â¥â¥â¥â¥ up, what you get instead is four player objectives carried out by a bland 'multiplayer' avatar. Please deep silver I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing love you guys do better for us Please you are capable we all know it thats why the hype was real for so many for this game even with next to no advertising (atleast on my end I saw next to nothing until a week before release.)   tl;dr     jenky gunplay and movement   â¥â¥â¥â¥ loads of I want just one more 'x'   Not good enough yet  wait for a sale or if you got 60 bucks try it and wait for deep silver to come out with something spectacular  
2312	Well I feel I must explain, there is alot of bad reviews and mixed reviews on this game, but it isn't from the gameplay it all has to do with the optimization, This is what I have to say ' The game looks beautiful, voice acting is awesome, cutscenes are awesome, having the option of going stealth or guns a blazin is a nice touch. I have played just over 2 hours now and I can see that it might get a little repetitive but what quest based rpg's don't at some point. I think the bike is a little hard to drive with mouse and keyboard, but pirfect with controler, there is a lot of moments that make you feel like a bad â¥â¥â¥, so I would rate this (10/10 would kill NORKS again), lol no I would give it an 8/10 though. Keep in mind this is a mostly single player experience, and has co-op play as well but I haven't tried that out, there is no competitive mp. as far as performance goes,   Specs:  i7 4790k OC 4.7GHZ 16gb ddr3 ram 1600mhz GTX 780 reference card Stock clock  I have all settings on very high except texture quality is at High, anti aliasing is off, and anisotropic filtering is at x8, runing 1080p of course, and super sampling is disabled as well, and I am getting 60 fps out of combat and about 45 in combat. It plays smooth and only have a couple of frame drops when switching between scenes that dip to like 15 fps for a breif second. So I don't know how everyone else with 980 ti's are experiencing worse fps than me. but great experience for me. also guys remember it just came out so it will take a little time to be optimized better but I have hope but for me runs great.
2313	In short this game is dull, boring, uninteresting and not fun to play. Im not sure how you â¥â¥â¥â¥ up the premise of being an underground freedom fighter taking back your city using makeshift tools, and inciting riots.....and somehow turn that into one of the least fun most boring games in existance. Skip this game unless you can get it at a heavy discount.
2314	The game is broken, its completely unplayable for me. On the first mission you have to cut through a fence with bolt cutters and then pick up a brick and throw it through a window and climb up and through the window, well when I pick up the brick Im unable to throw it at all.It says press Right Trigger to throw but it doesnt work on my controller (I tried for 10 minutes to no avail), so I switched my control scheme to mouse and keyboard and had the same problem. Once I pickl up the brick Im unable to do anything else with it besides set it down. Restarted the game and the problem persists. I will be asking for a refund I guess, I dont know what else to do. Its a shame too, the game looked beautiful up until it broke. What a waste, the devs ship[ped out an unfinished product. Im disappointed in Deep Silver, Metro 2033 and Last Light are 2 of my favorite games of all time. STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME UNTIL THEYVE WORKED OUT THE BUGS AND PATCHED THE HELL OUT OF IT!
2315	Gameplay is great , Graphics great  But game is unoptimized , too much bugs and performance issues , at this state I wont recommened this
2316	Good Game, Runs Smooth as Butter on my System. 84 fps to 144.   I like the customization on the fly so to speak, attachments.  reminds me of farcry 4 mechanics with Dying Light graphics, environment.   no consequence for accidentally shooting one of your team mate in Story mode is good I guess. just incase you run out of ammo LOL.
2317	It's pretty okay. +7 hours soon to be more, dunno why there is a big fuss.
2318	Main System Specs:   3 x EVGA 980ti  64gb DDR4 RAM  i7 5960k  3440x1440   Just about get 15fps.   So happy &lt;3
2319	A surprisingly good game.   I've seen a lot of complaints about poor optimization and bugs, so I'm going to assume it got some patches before I started playing, or my GTX 970 was simply able to grunt its way through all the performance issues. I didn't notice any graphical problems. The only bugs I encountered were a moment of dodgy clipping, but otherwise I've spent probably a good dozen hours in this without issues.   The game itself? It's like an urban Far Cry game done right.   The mobility is a little restricted compared to other FC games (your vehicle options consist exclusively of a dirt-bike, there is no wingsuiting or parachuting or zip-lining/grappling), but the storytelling *  is on point and is done with more consistency, depth, persistence and detail than the FC games. The same holds true of nearly every mechanic they've cared to explore.   Weapon upgrades are varied, relatively-easily acquired, and plentiful enough that you don't acquire them all in the first hour. Gear upgrades (for increased stealth, movement speed, etc) are similar.   Standard UbisoftGame(tm) 'collectible for the sake of collectible' fare is kept to a minimum, too. Nearly everything you scout out and obtain has a purpose.   Taking strongholds has a real noticable effect on the surrounding environments, and sometimes comes with believable, understandable requirements that make sense and change it up. The free-for-all shoot on sight red zones are basically discrete maps taking place in bombed-out industrial areas, and the residential centres ('yellow zones') involve a more visible and more involved civilian population with a heavier peace-keeper presence, and your guerrilla terrorist actions can really visibly change the entire mood and theme of these zones in subtle stages that are very impressive.   Standard stuff: Pros are gorgeous graphics, rich detail to the environments, solid mechanics, great pacing and difficulty. Cons are some janky UI quirks, eye-rollingly jingoistic story that hasn't done anything unpredictable yet, and rumours of bugs and performance issues that I personally haven't seen yet, so they're hard to take seriously.   Overall, it's a net win. I'm really enjoying this game.   *   And while it's better told than most video games, holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ it's a TERRIBLE story full of foul, unjustified nationalistic jingoism - because MURRICA! - without any signs of self-awareness... maybe it's too subtle for me, but I'm not sure if the developers are actually intending for players to realize that they're playing the bad guys. The plot revolves around a technologically-advanced and politically-savvy North Korean conquering the world's economy through technological superiority. America's disastrous foreign and domestic policies see it fighting wars in the middle east and other places it shouldn't be, having it bite them in the â¥â¥â¥ with massive losses thanks to terrorists/rogue states finally getting access to a nuke, while domestically its indulgent citizens grow used to lives of luxury they don't deserve thanks to it being primarily founded on loans from other countries they have no intention of paying back. When overreach goes too far and the US collapses in on itself due to gross mismanagement, there is rioting, rampant unemployment and crime, and gross inequality to the point that people are starving. When it all gets too much and the US government tells Korea (its primary creditor at this stage) that it intends to default on its MASSIVE debts, the Koreans decide that's not acceptable, and they will manage the poorly-managed country for themselves, and extract natural resources from the land to make up for the staggering US debt. 'Who's going to make us?' the US cries, and the Koreans reply, 'We will,' by disabling via back-doors (eyeroll) in the advanced military tech the US bought (but - and this is important - didn't actually PAY for; see above) from Korea. Cue a process of humanitarian aid for a nation that needed it, accompanied by an occupation which is benevolent to those who embrace it, and harsh on the terrorists who murder the occupiers. Go figure. If I was on a peacekeeping mission to provide aid and support to a nation that needed it and the generosity was repaid by watching the natives murder my brothers, I'd be a lot saltier about it than the Koreans are in this. There's really no question about it, from the premise. American Freedom Fighters are the bad guys. This point is really rammed home when the first people you meet after the intro are a couple hicks who want to kill you on the spot before they even ask any questions about why a fellow American is in Resistance tunnels, and who think an appropriate method for delivery to HQ is via concussion. Delivery to an ex-con psychopath who holds high rank, and whose primary form of intelligence-gathering is 'torture first, ask questions later - basic questions such as, 'are you part of the resistance and do you have any proof or can anyone in our organization verify this'? Which is exactly what happens when a non-psychopath steps in and takes your ID card and verifies it. All while you sit there with a concussion that a medical professional expresses concern about, but whose concerns are dismissed by everyone except the patient. These are horrible, horrible people, to a man. Even the most inoffensive of these jingoistic cliches tries to rally their terrorist friends by noting that while the NK peace-keepers may be better fed, better trained, have better weapons and armour, better vehicles, better drones, better equipment, better support, better comms networks, somehow every US terrorist is worth ten NK's... because Americans are naturally superior. (Despite getting their asses handed to them so badly that they actually 'lost their country'.) Yeah. It's Manifest Destiny In the Face Of Evidence. It's pretty telling how every time you over-take a stronghold, it goes from slick, pristine, well-mainted order to a graffiti-tagged, junk-filled hell-hole. 'You Can't Tell Me To Clean Up My Room You're Not My Real Dad', the game. So the story conceit is crap and you play a bad guy, working with a bunch of other unlikeable bad guys, but are supposed to root for them because... otherwise there wouldn't be much of a game. Ugh.  
2320	good game. greeat graphics most of the time. A few glitches but sure a couple of patches will fix them.
2321	Dont buy this sheet ...... First mission has thousands of bugs.... I play 5 min and for me enough happy did not buy.......I dont know who many will be in future
2322	So far the single player is pretty much amazing.  Graphics are of this gen, and are nothing amazing, but they're solid.  Sounds are on point.  Story - NK is in charge of the US, we fight back, kill some NK's, good enough for me.
2323	This game makes me want to join Korea and kill this nation.   -11/10  First one was better.  Gonna KMS after this gg no re
2324	Terrible first impression. This game made me alt-f4 and uninstall during the first 10 minuttes simply because it was so bad.
2325	  playing this game is like having a view-master duct taped to your face while you get spun around on an office chair for 30 minutes straight. at first you get mixed feelings. this is interesting. maybe it'll get better? but you realize those feelings were just your stomach and then you throw up  edit: it was kindly brought to my attention that i could have stopped the chair whenever i wanted so i threw up for no reason so i am kind of an idiot. it still wasnt a good time, though
2326	the game certainly has pontential and seems fun. but it was a bad decision for me to buy this game from â¥â¥â¥ since i cant get a refund lol. i thought the game is good according to the trailer or sth but the truth is the game is really boring. the missions are really repeitive and just make me dont want to play this game anymore lol.
2327	Lol so much hate See @dood1234  8.6/10 - Enjoyable
2328	There are some problems with this game, such as Frame drops, glitches, bugs but I think that the gameplay is quiet awesome. Some stuff is taken from Far Cry 3,4 but it is still very interesting game.
2329	Bar of soap
2330	If you like the first Homefront, you might enjoy this one. It's has a more open world-ish feel to it (it's divided into zones/regions). The Coop is great - not too short missions either.
2331	Since eurogamer thinks that norks is a racial slur im going to have to give this game a positive rating... â¥â¥â¥â¥ing eurogamer
2332	  Well... nope. Thank you, but most of the game till now (44 minutes) were cutscenes. Controlls are not working smooth, and I do not mean fps. They're just not responding naturally.  Played during the free weekend.
2333	  Well... nope. Thank you, but most of the game till now (44 minutes) were cutscenes. Controlls are not working smooth, and I do not mean fps. They're just not responding naturally.  Played during the free weekend.
2334	  Overall, I give the game a 7/10
2335	I'm enjoying the game. i liked the first game and people knocked on the ending. hellooooooo? cliffhanger meant to spur a sequel? OH HEY LOOK THEY MADE ONE. Performance issues and Glitches? i'm sorry did you people not know this game has changed hands on 3 seperate occasions and finally landed with someone who doesn't want a cool concept of a game to die out? If one company writes a buttload of code and then another follows and then another follows and so on and so forth do you really think they're not going to miss something? i was excited for this game. but because of my prior knowledge of the last game being a bit buggy and this game changing hands so often i kept my expectations somewhat low. by doing that and not overhyping this game i have had a very surprisingly enjoyable experience. it's not 'Pre Next Gen Console' graphics. thats such a stupid comparison. on ultra this game is beautiful. if you go into this game knowing it's more linear than it promises and less CoD-esque(it's not as run and gun as people say. exaggerations the lot of em) you'll have fun. i play on normal and the AI shotgunners FLank, the Riflemen take cover and throw grenades and the snipers snipe. Is this game close to Far Cry in the type of gameplay? sure. does it have elements from other games? absolutley. is it GOD AWFUL AND YOU SHOULD NEVER PICK THIS UP? absolutely....NOT. if you're not willing to pay the price tag then WAIT for the Price drop and bug fixes. but i'm damn well content playing this game as is. my friends and i will be playing the co-op campaigns now and as the DLC drops for more.
2336	Needs optimisation, and some keys cant be rebound like X for example which will do what it does by default and what you bind it to do, this for me means costomizing my weapon and crouching at the same time with X which is quite anoying !! Apart from that i am quite enjoying the game
2337	the games fun just to kill sometime, its nothing special.   Pros's  the graphics are great the guns are cool the story is alright  Negatives - story is too short lack of detail to the plot (missing emotion from the first one) AI can be buggy     All in all the question is would i go out and buy this game again say for a different platform? my answer is no just because this is a generic FPS with rpg elements, and generic is getting boring now
2338	Got trapped in a corner by npc women, calls me an â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, real life simulator
2339	  this is the worst game ever played in my entire gaming career. it sucks and don't ever think about trying it. i m actually pukeing right now, just a sec.
2340	I came into this thinking it was going to be bad...   instead now I can honestly say I enjoyed the few hours on it so far. Varied , plenty to do, the format reminds me of UBI games like fary cry and â¥â¥â¥ creed,  side missions and pinned jobs like bounties.  the general character, movement and weapon choices and the 'crysis style' weapon mod 'x' is cool turning a battle rifle from a sniper rifle into a rocket launcher  its a pity there is no multiplayer, but it does have coop.
2341	All you need to know is if this â¥â¥â¥â¥ really goes down this game will NOT help us win the war.
2342	Just a clarification for those who have only heard negative stuff about how the game is so buggy:  Yes the game is buggy. But the gameplay is amazing! Almost all of the negative commentary I've heard surrounding this game focused on the amount of bugs, but totally ignored the excellent work that went in to creating the fast paced, open-world gameplay. Easily the most fun I've had in a shooter in a long time (Rainbow Six Siege being the one exception in the last 5 years). Lots of weapons and weapon modifications. Enemies are (usually) some of the better examples of AI in shooter gaming. Story is interesting enough to keep your attention, when the graphics aren't glitching out, this game is most excellent! Grab it and give it a try. Wait for a sale if you're nervous, but do it! 
2343	idk how i feel about it to be honest like its nothing like the first one. its cool and all but idk its not what i was expecting. Runs great on my pc idk why people are saying it runs like garbage   System specs  i7 4790k 8gb ram gtx780ti  sorry homefront you're not like you use to be ):
2344	Total aids, THIS MIGHT AS WELL BEEN MADE BY UBISOFT.
2345	I feel like allot of people went into this game with preconceived ideas on how it was going to be, after reading allot of the reviews from the days after the release i could see people with not even 30 mins in the game giving it poor reviews, allouth this game isn't in the same league as wolfenstein, witcher or any of the other of the big name games that have come out in the past years it must certainly isn't a bad game,I wouldn't recommend paying full price for this game however it is a very good game to pickup on a summer/weekend sale, it is definitely worth about 20 euros.  
2346	Great Refund Simulator 10/10 would refund again,
2347	Another 'open world' game where you have to scavenge and â¥â¥â¥â¥ (i already have fallout 4,rust arma and whatever..) thought this was gonna be like the first one. But noooo. Please gamemakers dont make anymore games like this its boring. its not pew pew.
2348	Most of the early comments being so negative were unjustified, dont know what happened there. There have been ALOT of games that came out in a much worse state that didnt receive this kind of flak.  That being said, it does need some polish, there are technical imperfections and all that.  But they havent really bothered me in the slightest, im actually enjoying the open world vibe alot ! The shooting is nice, it looks great, the vibe of revolution is there and i just like how the kpa guys look and their high tech stuff feels like a threat.  UPDATE: the patch adresses non issues for me, i notice the slight stutter but i only experience them at the shops. I would much rather see some stronghold fixes, two of them are bugged out in my game and cannot be captured.  The AI issues people have spammed the discussion boards with are out of proportion, yes, there is silly behaviour... propaganda trucks trying to drive up a trashpile into a wall etc, but in al honesty i have not seen this alot. Maybe it doesnt catch my attention like it did in fallout 3 and 4.  Also, i am enjoying this game quite alot, the score it received is absolute nonsense. It should be around 75 imo (still not finished with it). Theres alot more to do and atmosphere than most triple A shooters, it even runs WAY (WAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYY) better for me on high/highest settings than far cry 4 which i had to run on medium settings to be able to shoot something.

2350	Imma just jump straight to pro/con  Pro  premise is 11/10 typical FPS with crafting, if you're into that (I like it) attractive atmosphere and design fun to shoot Koreans  Cons &lt;60 fps constantly, a lot of the time it's &lt;30 AI is literally AIDS. Like, really awful. For being in 2016, AI should be much better. While the premise is 11/10, the delivery is heavily lacking in-game very repetitive, and I only played 2 hours. 2 hours of the same â¥â¥â¥â¥; while that's not much time, putting it into future perspective I don't want to have spent 70 buck to keep doing it When the civilians rise up it's significantly more underwhelming than it should be. No epic riots, no gang fights, just some people hitting a dumpster with a bat, some jumping up and down. and over 50% of people just walking around like nothing is going on. They don't stand and fight any KPA, they just run away, making it all seem literally pointless  Overall 4/10, not what I hoped for.

2359	54 minutes in the game and I have to say I love it.  I personally don't understand why so many people and publications gave it bad reviews. The graphics,dialogues,presentation and gameplay are great and for those who like games with a bit of apocalypse, dystopia and the style of Far Cry it's more than good,it's fantastic. If you're into such themes go for it! The beauty is that it's not the mindless kind of game like CoD has become. Like another reviewer had said in his review: It's guerilla warfare.It's not Rambo style guns blazing.  In the end it's all about taste and personally,I LOVE it.
2360	Worst thing about the entire game: There's an entire Korean army and there's not even a single Korean character
2361	wtf is rong this time geting error trid evry thing i can think of wow ,,!,: so no i dont recomend it .it cood be good just not a finisht game and not wurth 59.99  steam sold my this game ...steam box thers the resin it faild is hard to trust steam thay sell limins
2362	Game is quite fun, I play it to kill time and tends to get stuck on you. Interesting story behind it too.  Only thing I would complain about are the bugs Ex; walking through a lamp post every now and then or sudden drop in FPS and lags to follow. Though I wouldn't say it's THAT bad to the extent where I would want to stop playing.  Reading a lot of the reviews, just remember that people will always find something to complain about. I would give this game a shot if I were you.  Would recommend it, quite fun. :)  7/10
2363	Im going to preface my review with what I think has happened in general to the PC gaming community. There are now two diverse groups of gamers. You have a core of what I call hard core PC games then you have the consolized group. The consolized group are looking for something completely different than your old school hard core PC gamer. They want snow flake movie quatlity story lines where thery are the center of attention, extreme NPC close ups with 15 minute cut scenes, lots of dance dance revolution type combat scenarios, and they usually have â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ PC's that cant run games that push technology so they are always crying about peformance. Now they might read this and say 'no we dont, we just a game thats fun'. BUT if it has to have ALL that fluffy crap to be considered fun then your are consolized.  Then you have the traditional PC gamer, like me, that wants games like homefront with beautifully rendered game world, check, open world play, check, minimal to the point story line, check, and tons and tons of amazing gun play.  This game delivers all this in spades, one of the best shooters I have played in a long long time. And with a computer built for GAMING not f-ing facebook, I'm pulling well over 100FPS on high settings, no slow downs zero stuttering.  With Homefront sometimes I feel like Im playing a Half Life 2 style game with better graphics an an open ended world that I can just run around and find trouble in. AI is escalting so your always challenged. And nightmare mode with auto aim assist off feels just about right for an experienced PC gamer. Though it could be a tad harder.  This is the Cry Engine so it runs amazing and the level design is simply astonishing. The attention to detail is amazing.  Ive had no bugs no broken quests nothing to get in the way of the fun, just a fantastic shooter being torn about by the console influenced derps.
2364	It's cool...graphics may be a litte bit outdated but overall it is fun game.
2365	Bad game rushed out the door.
2366	Not a bad game, much more enjoyable then the 1st game.  The game does use Denuvo though so not recommended  1.5/10
2367	I would like to say 'hey this game is bad in terms of design and is just boring' however when the framerate is sub 20 on a decent pc my only advice is do not buy this unless they release a patch which magically makes this game dying light,meaning a suprisingly great game, avoid at all costs
2368	After playing this game for like 2 hours or so... I love it. Here is why m8-  Pros- - GG (Good Game) - GG (Good Graphics) - GG (Good Gameplay) - Good Story - Super Fun - Very non-linear in how you play the game (Guns blazing, or stealth)  Cons- - You need a [really] good PC to play it - Random lag spikes whenever the game saves, or you exit some type of menu - Explosions cause lag spikes  In the end, there are way more Pros than Cons. So get it m8.
2369	Poor gameplay, Poorly Optomized, Horrible dialog and voice acting, graphics are good in some spots and look like shart in others and over its just boring. Not fun, Not executed properly and not polished at all. Could have been cool. Worth around 20 dollars. 4/10
2370	...umm after i playing this games with last update, the games run more smoothly, but sometimes AI is still silly and unbelievable...     i will explain why AI looks silly...sometimes if u shooting AI from long range they just not moving...freeze like stone...and sometimes AI is like a god...they didnt die even i shoot them many times from long range, especially in resistance mode...i must go closer to kill AI (btw i use sniper/battle riffle with silencer...shooting AI in the head, and they didnt die...wow)...that problem only happen sometimes...like 1.5 from 5...  i still recommend this games....its fun if u have friend to play... i hope they dev add something new...maybe new weapon, new vehicle, or new ability/skill...  P.S: this is my review, buy or not its your decision...  
2371	Seems like all the cool kids have got on the hate train for this game, well not me, I see a real gem  Great gfx (amazing at 4k)  Story is okay, but needed more time (America should have been the corrupt occupying force that you figh against)  You are not some prophetic saviour with a gun (not a hero, not a 1 man army (well, okay you kinda are), but i do love that I'm not the most important man in the game.  DO NOT play this like other fps, you need to hit and run (the game tries to reinforce this again &amp; again, you die fast and will fight against never ending waves when NEW to a zone)  + Its street by street, block by block warfare with thight controls, fun enviromental puzzels, an okay plot, and great gfx  +Most bugs, issues have been fixed  - The gameplay loop can become repetitive, moral questions are brought up, but never explored deeply  Give the game a chance, its no witcher 3, but I'd play this over 100 CallOfDuty games any day of the week.
2372	Terrible optimization. I have a mid to high grade gaming pc and everytime I get into a fight, the fps drops down to around 20 fps. I messed with the settings for twenty minutes, still buggy and slow fps. Waste of money until they fix it.
2373	the bashing of this game needs to stop NOW  I have just finished it on medium on PC and started fresh on hardest. I have never before replayed a game because most games are so fin stupid and easy to play with exceptions of super hard boss fights. This game is fps fallout setting with darksouls hardness gameplay, so if you cant handle that move on play some chicken â¥â¥â¥â¥ easy hand-held campaign like cod or bf4 single player or stuff around with 50 000 mods in fallout, or spend hours skinning animals and chasing icons on the map in ubisofts epics, and stop bashing this game. If not for technical issues this is easily 10/10.  Why 10/10?  For starters enemies movements are completely unpredictable. I have been siting on a roof studying the enemy patrol moving about on the road under me for 15min and yep no frigin pattern they randomly stop look around and change direction. You cant just watch enemy move about for 1min and sus out their movement pattern so you can set up an ambush. No if you planning and ambush you have to lure enemy in. So many times i planted a bomb on the road after spotting enemy convoy rolling down towards me to find it just stop outside of the bomb reach or turning down side street or just started chasing some other npc starting to cause trouble. Fantastic.  If you alert the enemy they keep spawning over and over - guess what if you were a rebel fighter fighting against 10 of thousand of soldiers what do you think would happen? But if you alert them and than run to hide, as soon as you break line of sight you can hide behind obstacles or in containers and toilets - you cant do that in say far cry where enemy ai will chase you relentlessly always knowing where you are. Another brilliant thing. Well done on enemy AI. + sometimes enemy might look into the toilet or inside the container. Soo tense plus you have constant threat from airships scanning from above.  Also its not true that they keep respawning - if you clear an area quietly and don't raise any alarms no enemy will respawn as it should be. However if you alert them and one comes to investigate and than you make noise killing him others will come and than better run and hide as they will start respawning in that zone. Also iv never had an enemy respawn from thin air it looks like they always run from somewhere else into your zone. This is not like majority of games a run and gun affair and probably why so many bad reviews. If you want run and gun play doom - I personally hated it, and don't let me started on repetitive.  The side missions in homefront are great, varied, I have cleared all of them which other reviewer clearly have not. Missions actually require from you to think explore observe listen. You might see the obj marker on the map and on your screen but that does not mean you will know what to do and how to secure the obj.   My favourite was having to find some blueprint that was stashed in one of the houses. 1st the area is crawling with enemy so you might want to clear them out quietly. If you don't go quiet well guess what, enemy will keep respawning and if you do sound an alarm better lure them away from the objective building. So I cleared the building and than could not find any blueprints. 5min later I got radio massage telling me to look for markings and symbols on the walls. I checked every wall and could not see â¥â¥â¥â¥. I thought maybe its on the level above me and I need to find how to get up and than I noticed that some of the ceiling panels were hanging and some were missing. I started shooting the ceiling thinking maybe I can break one down and climb to the roof and than I spotted an x, shoot the panel and blueprint flattered down from its hiding spot. Brilliant.  Atmosphere in this game is fantastic. You can spend some time sabotaging and gaining respect from the crowd which ultimately leads to them rebelling against oppressors and becoming recruitable followers (4 at the time I think) or you can try and stealth your way through the whole zone (didn't work for me and I liked how â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off the crowd gets and randomly attacks the soldiers and beet them to pulp).  To add i have restarted the game on deathwish and am having so much fun just cruising around attacking enemy patrols and hiding away than looking to atack another patrol or secure an stronghold or outpost. Just wishing i could turn off the minimap.  WHY NOT 10/10?  Graphics  Honestly I didn't care as gameplay was so immersive. I'm running i74790+msi gtx980ti gaming. I could not run all max @1440, it did run all max @1080 but with fps drops so I settled at 1080 medium and some low settings. Still looked good for some reason fantastic during rain and night - noticeably crappy in the midday light. FPS drops - the game tends to freeze and fps dropped drastically randomly - it looked like it had to do with enemy ai rather than environment graphics. I noticed whenever I got spotted and alarm was sound id get mini freeze. not every time though. I tried cranking up the graphics and in the areas with no enemy or before enemy found where I was it would run fine even on max setting.  Bugs and glitches.  Couple of times I could not progress through a level due to vehicle I was meant to follow got stuck. Quick restart from my save game backup solved it but... something that needs to be fixed Character models - I played uncharted 4 soo yes these are old looking.  Characters and story  Again I played uncharted 4, and tlou but seriously what can be done that's not clichÃ© anymore? For what game was about its good story, actually no the story is crap but the gameplay, enemy ai, missions and side missions unlike most other games I played including uncharted4, fallout dying light etc. were fantastic.  Voice-overs  some were good some were pore the time wasted on radio recordings would of been better spent on more variety in npc lines Overall - I hope other studios can pick the best parts from this game and make something really spectacular next time. Or Dumbusters can learn from their mistakes this time. I don't understand why they had to associate this with homefront which was total failure. This should have been new I.P . So I loved atmosphere the heart this game had the gameplay etc it reminded me a lot of Falling Skies. So my tip for next time - Keep it hard like this even harder maybe an alien invasion and definitely new ip.  imagine if moders would treat this same as fallout and improve it 
2374	yall a bunch of f wits ive for only two problems and its not enough too run deep silver into the ground do use realise theres no perfit games out there they all have issues and how many of u dumb dumbs could build a better game first game i went off on reading the reveiws haha deep silver f them all i love this game its better then the division now the game might learn abit about adding like motos to get around on did any of use realise this is what use said great graphixs then u say frame rate drops so mean while use look around the great graphixs and frame rates drop it would be crapie as yes use get the point i love it 10/10 even with the two problems ive had still made it playable dont listen to the negatives there full of u know
2375	This is just a stupid game. Game play is bad glitches I can't believe this is a AAA game the first one was a lot better and that was a bad game. I will not recomend this game to anyone don't waist your money.
2376	Worse than The Division. First 45 minutes of the game is cut scenes. The multiplayer co-op only has 6 missions, and the AI is worse than the Three Stooges.  I had to turn the detail way down to get rid of mouse lag and stop the nausea.  Gunplay was bad. Ran out of ammo in the first mission. I swear the graphics in the multiplayer were worse than in the single player, but maybe that's just me.  So yeah, go back to The Division. You'll have more fun getting ganked in the darkzone by hackers than trying to play this.
2377	Haven't completed the game yet but so far it is pretty good.  I feel that the developers saying this is an open world is an understatment (In my honest opinion). I say this because the 'open world' is segmented into Areas, or 'hubs' as some may refer to. This means the map works off of the same basis as Deus Ex and Thief (Reboot) where you're given a map which is segmented into zones which are traversed via loading screens if entered. This does not lessen the experience, though. As the areas are much varied from run down industrial areas, poverty stricken backstreets and pristine utopias.  The gun-play is well thought out keeping the amount of weapons to a minimum but allowing to 'mod' the weapon into a complete different firearm, for example you can use a pistol and turn it into a machine pistol which treats you with an oddly satisfying animation of taking the weapon apart and assembling this said firearm.  In terms of performance, flawless. With v-sync I'm running at 60fps as the norm, and without I'm hitting the high 160fps with no stutter. This was tested at 'very high' settings. I'm using a 980ti and an i7 6700k 4ghz.  Pros: Gun play Area transition Nice graphics Story gets by okay Satisfying motorcycle gameplay (What's better than riding a dirtbike through apartment blocks?)  Cons: Stealth seems to lack (You can peak over objects but not peak around the side?) There's a lot of room for a 'parkour' feel they could have exploited but seems to be vaccant Weapons can get boring after a while, which is a downside to the gun play  8/10  I don't see why this game is getting a lot of stick. They put a lot of work into this and I'm overly surprised they managed to pull this game out of dev hell. Not a lot of games survive that â¥â¥â¥â¥.
2378	why does this game exsist because it sucks
2379	People saying poor optimalisation... i got 60 FPS (accept when saving) all the time with a pc of 1300 euro's (2.5 years old) so don't cry about that :D  Gamplay is pretty good only got 3 glitches: wall missing enemy without a gun Bomb Car glitches out of the map (3 times on same position yeah i am stubit)  ---Update--- Story was 10 hours of gameplay time for me (no side missions done)    My sponsor:  http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ArchReviews/ 
2380	i like the game but i can not beat it im at the end and the sam car is stuck
2381	This game is good, the people who are hating on it are also the same people who judge a game by its graphics.
2382	The game isn't optimized very well, mainly because of cryengine I guess. So you may not get great fps, but it's toally worth it!!! It plays like Dying Light and Hitman at the sametime. Those are the best comparisons I can draw from the game. The gameplay isn't 'clunky' but rather 'tactical' so if you're looking for a run 'n gun shooter, DO NOT get this game. Sure you can kill alot of people but only in smart ways otherwise you'll be toast. The story is cool, and its open world, what is there not to like?
2383	I felt what it meant to be a true American, So much freedom and liberty that I became Uncle Sam and now have a pet Eagle.
2384	Now that it's been a couple of days and I've been able to properly play for a bit, I feel like now's a good time to revise this review a bit. Originally I left a recommended review in hopes to counter-act the completely idiotic influx of first-minute nay-sayers, complaining that the game was broken on a technical level; so don't expect me to talk about optimization and what-have-you with this review. Mainly I'm going to focus on the content itself, the gameplay, and the narrative, so here-goes.  First up, the game's narrative revolves around the idea that the U.S. has fallen under the control of a fantastically powerful North Korea, an idea somewhat far-fetched, especially for the first game where we were supposed to believe that Kim Jong Un led a successful military campaign that swallowed up the whole world. However, this game actually rewrites the original game's story, in fact, I would even go so far as to say this game shouldn't even be considered at all part of the first's canon, in fact, this is more a do-over from last time to fix the original's mistakes; that's a good thing, in case you were wondering. But I digress, Homefront: The Revolution's rewrite ditches the concept of the U.S. losing a pew-pew fight with North Korea, and instead adopts a rather competently thought out economic downfall scenario in it's stead. For some, this scenario may still be farfetched, but the fact that it's better thought out than the idea of the United States military being defeated by the N.K.A. in conventional warfare... well, needless to say it deserves quite a bit of merit, considering the subject matter. So, you begin the game as Ethan  Bradberry  Brady, a proverbial nobody who's caught the eye of the local resistance cell's top dog, some Benjamin Walker, and are apparently about to meet up with him for some unknown reason before the safehouse you're in gets attacked by the K.P.A. (Korean People's Army). After an interrogation scene that leads to your rescue by this Benjamin Walker, which leaves him with a nasty leg-wound, things start to spiral downhill rather fast as you get introduced to the game's world, solving a few puzzles to advance the plot, which ultimately ends with Walker's capture before you manage to escape underground and happen upon another mass of the local resistance cell, thus beginning your adventure. One of the first things I noticed about this game is the connect between people loyal to the K.P.A., and those that belong to the resistance. What do I mean by this? Well, in the first game your enemy was a faceless pack of genocidal asians who shot mothers and fathers in the face right in front of their kids before dumping the bodies into huge mass graves, then, when all was said and done, they'd celebrate with a night of napalming an entire town. Of course, some might think that such a situation promotes fear-mongering and bigotry towards North Koreans, but for someone like me who isn't blind to the fact that genocide and mass graves are things that are very much still around in this day and age, the premise wasn't really that ridiculous. However, where as that relationship between the invading force and the population was spurred on by the fact that the K.P.A. was occupying the U.S. amidst an open war with the U.S. government, allowing for belivability in the idea that all enemies are militaristic ghestapo thugs wanting to crush all resistance... Well, such a scenario can't really happen in this game, considering the North Koreans are supposed to be a 'relief force,' helping the United States out of it's economic strife, supposedly, while trying to get good marks from the U.N. As such, most K.P.A. forces you find will be made up of actual Americans who sympathize with the occupational forces, and concepts like genocide and murder take a back seat to simple reeducation camps and acts of police brutality; basically, the situation is much more docile, and less-likely to upset Tumblr. Regardless of this fact, though, this story does not have many sides, as you need to remember this game is about a revolutionary force fighting for their homeland, as such, it's very biased to the side of the resistance.  So, now that the narrative is out of the way, let's move on to the game itself: It's really good. Kek, but seriously trying to explain the gameplay without gushing too much is going to be difficult, so bear with me a bit. What's readily apparent is that the game is open world, which can be good or bad, depending on how you look at it. A lot of games tend to fall flat on their face due to having an open world, mainly utilizing large, open spaces that are nothing more than set-pieces which do nothing to suppliment any gameplay. Homefront: The Revolution actually accounts for this, believe it or not, as every single building, alleyway, and street seems to offer something new and useful as you make your way through war-torn Philladelphia on your crusade of righteousness. The locations are designed with, shall I say, 'fluidity of movement' in mind, which is perfect for trying to escape patrols as you sprint around the corner, into an alleyway before baseball sliding under a broken fence and ultimately climb up onto and begin jumping from rooftop to rooftop in a bid to escape; it's really exciting at times. On top of that, the locations are rather small, which is great, truly, as it allows a great deal of detail and focus on the important aspects that makes each sector unique, all the while keeping you from being overwhelmed by useless, needless side-fluff. As a side note, irony, it should be taken into account that there are indeed side missions, things like bulletin jobs for extra cash, taking over enemy strongholds to expand your influence, sabotaging equipment, finding radios, etc. But, unlike some games that would try to sell you the concept that doing these things are crucial to better your character and unlock new things, well, this game doesn't really shove that down your throat too much. Rather, you'd simply do these things because it's convenient for you, and the developers have done a fantastic job to make them as minimally monotonous as possible. Mainly, the two types of side missions you'll be working on are 'strikes' (stronghold takeovers), and 'hearts and minds,' First-off, 'strikes' pit you against an area's stronghold and it's garrison, your job being to take care of an objective inside the fort at your own liesure, letting a time-skip play out, and then leaving you to continue on some hours later after the resistance has set up shop in their new digs. This lets you unlock new respawn zones and shops, as well as providing you with points that you'll use to purchase upgrade kits and new tools to expand your available arsenal. The othe type of side mission, which is actually a by-product of doing 'strikes,' is 'hearts and minds,' basically, this is the prospect of winning over the opinion of the general populace, geting them to rise up against the North Korean occupation. This is achieved by doing many different things, and is actually a lot more enjoyable and fluid than I had imagined it would be, as you often rack up points towards the success of this project by 'drum-roll' playing the game, of all things. No hunting collectibles, no '5 out of 9 objectives completed,' just straight, glorious game that lets YOU decide how and when things will happen.  So, that's really all I have to say about that, I'd planned to type out more, as this game has a LOT of fresh ideas and concepts it brings to the table. But, Steam's abysmal word-count won't allow me to do such, so I'll have to hope what's here is sufficient enough for the average reader. My final verdict is that I bought two copies of this game, both with the season pass for me and my brother; we haven't regretted it one bit.
2385	I don't know why this has gotten so many negative reviews. It has a pretty long single player and an above great co-op experience. Yes I know know it doesn't have a player vs player multiplayer game mode. Does it need one honestly? No it does not. Besides it can't beat the first person shooter multiplayers that are already out.   I think it has a decent story but to be blunt there is no character depth. The most interesting person I've met in this wanted to kill me thinking I was a spy. Though each new non-player character is unique they just lack, well character. You know defining traits, fears, and ambitions. Hell I would have settled for some personality in more than just two or three of them.   I love the molding while on the move, especially the 'Freedom Launcher', goodness that's fun to shoot.  Oh by the way Deep Silver, â¥â¥â¥â¥ your airship.  My last complaint, let the player character talk! You don't get to customize him at all, so let him freaking talk. The utter silence from your character except co-op is annoying.  Last thing you should know, embrace the old pirate tradition, 'fight to run away'. Running can save your life. Which there also isn't a heavy penalty for dying like you'd think, you just lose a couple things of loot.   All in all, buy it for a decent story or co-op and you'd be happy.
2386	G A R B A G EÂ®: The Revolution
2387	i like to play the game
2388	Honestly, I like the game. Haven't run into most of the problems others are describing.
2389	how can you shoot anything in this game?
2390	WTF The game!!! I don't buy next new The Dambuster Studios Game.
2391	plays fine on my rig. the game looks fine to me also.
2392	The game performs very poorly especially if you have a mid range pc do not buy in its current state unless you have a beast pc
2393	I'm pretty mixed on this game,to be honest. After only playing for an our I can already tell that this is a game for certain people. First off,the graphics are amazing (but sometimes causes framerate problems), second the gameplay...I am speechless, not that it is amazing nor it is that terrible, its a weird limbo in terms of actual combat (which you can just breeze by most enemies,bike or not) and the voice acting is pretty average for today's standards. I just kinda cranked this review out in order to involve myself in the review %, but honestly, for now this is all you really need to know about the game for now. (Oh,btw the weapons system is amazing, I do give some credit for that)
2394	lags with a high-end computer on the lowest settings..well i guess we were the test dumbies...i am glad the other countries get a polished verson of it on the 20th....your welcome
2395	For a new studio to develop this game and with such a small team I have to say it is very impressive what they achieved. As for the game itself I really liked it I know critics are giving it bad reviews I would say most of them have never played the game and just judging it based on what they see. Yes there are a lot saying fps dips and what not but remember this game is running on Cryengine 5, the new Crytek engine. Remember in 2007 when Crysis launched? Most computers could barely run it I would say the same thing here the engine is to advanced for what current hardware is capable of doing that most people would have. Their would be few exceptions those who run triple or quad CrossFire/SLI, but most people probably. Run a single gpu or duo gpu's is it a good story that is something I feel yes and no the idea of the whole series is great. Story could have been maybe another hour or two but I would not knock, a star off for it because it is an open world game and if I wanted the story element and not an open world I would not have bought it. Visually this game is very impressive minor details are there that lack in other AAA games now a days but. Used in exist back when the cod series was becoming popular before it became a yearly cash grab release franchise. As for recomending this game I would say yes because I think if Deep Silver, had a bigger budgement in the next series then I think they could defintely make a better game and spend time working out a really intriguing story. Their is even mention about what happened to Koas Studios, and this franchise changing hands to Crytek, then being sold to Deep Silver. That is something I did not expect since most developers for games if they change studios there is no mention about that anywhere in the game itself.
2396	I Honestly think people don't like Homefront: The Revolution because it requires some brain matter.  Fun game, Will replay with friends
2397	I don't often write reviews but I feel the need with this game. I also don't often pre-order games but I was super stoked for Homefront: The Revolution. It didn't dissapoint. I am in love with this game and as someone who rarely finds playing games multiple times is worth while this game I promise you I will beat repeatedly. I already beat it once. Took me 29 hours to do on hardened/normal. There is repeatability there. I rushed through the first time to get the story but the second time I will take the time to explore everything, find everything, and do all of the side missions. The game is challenging at times and easy at times. Sometimes you feel out of control and sometimes you feel completely in control. It has a beautiful balance between open world and story. The plot twists are well done. I do have to say one of my favorite parts though is the fact that you can see the effect you are having on the population. Your actions change the demeaner of the citizens in step by step progressions as you do more to encourage them. The Red Zones are run and gun where as the yellow zones are are more Assassins Creedish with a soldierly spin. Lets just say this game grabbed me, sucked me in, and I thought about it constantly when I wasn't playing. Honestly in my opinion anybody complaining about this game should have known not to buy it before it came out. They produced the game they promised and if you pre-order a game you should expect bugs. I had less then I expected. Although I will say at the moment I have not played multiplayer for I am unable to. I keep getting an error code.

2400	It's good        not....
2401	horrible port, should have stayed on iOS and Android
2402	After the first cut scene, right when they noticed the streets were empty, the entire screen went black. No wonder he thought they were empty!   10/10 Best black screen simulator I've ever played!   ....Now wheres my refund button...  AMD A10-5700 3.4 GHz Quad Core 12 GB ram R9 280X 3 gig GFX Windows 7 Home Premium
2403	Who was the idiot that desing the hacking process in the game ,had much hope for he game going to play the Division again as much as I don't like it at the current state ,however this one really let me down.
2404	Add Chinese PLZ!!!
2405	Dont understand while its getting all this hate i dont really care bcuase all i spent on this game was half a ham sandwitch
2406	waste if money.
2407	Its like someone â¥â¥â¥â¥ on a brick and sold to the public for 60 dollars...
2408	i tried to give it a shot even though everyone else gave it bad reviews... needless to say very disappointed!
2409	why my game is black screen
2410	It's just very bad okay
2411	I had fun playing this game :)
2412	i will start you can down vote my review if you wish but trolls are trolls. Frankly this game has flaws but it is fun and enjoyable game i have ben enjoying co op and not touched much of the SP but either way allot of techicals will likely be fixed long term and i do not regret buying this game infact i am happy i did
2413	The AI is garbage, and when you are in a firefight its slow and bland and the voice acting does not match the characters mouth movement and the way they look
2414	The main reason I bought this game was to kill North Koreans. I did a lot of that, so I don't see a negative.
2415	The game has a very limited multiplayer, only the 12 coop missions. I can only compare them to mw2's spec ops, they are short and for me personally have little to no replayability. 2/10
2416	This is a really good and fun game. Definately feels like Homefront 2. Hope they make a sequel.
2417	This is the biggest and worstest Game ever.  So much Potenzial
2418	Why do peoplle give bad reviews clearly this is a good, who wouldn't want to kill koreans? they make â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ samsung phones and tv's so is their high priced pos cars too. i highly recommend co-op is fun wioth 3 of your friends. Division is dead is this a good replacement for it? why yest it. It's fun, sleek and enemy ai alway play a differnet stratedgy thaan before.
2419	Better than Call of Duty Infinite Warfare
2420	Christ, just â¥â¥â¥â¥in' no... 10 GOD DAMN MINUTES OF INTRO CINEMATICS! then every damn sequence after that is just a filler â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. No no no... noooooooooooooooooooooooooo.... just nooooooooooo.....  If a game is 6 hours long because of un-interruptable 'movie/scene' sequences that have absolutely no interest to the player and it's actually 2 hours long with ACTUALY gameplay. DO NOT MAKE THE DAMN SEQUENCES NON-SKIPPABLE! If i'm not interested then you can't FORCE me to be. Graphically, fine enough quality Story.... ERHMERGERD, IM TURKING MURRICA BERK! ME STRONG MURRICAN!!!  It's a typical, we're rebelling against a oppressive regime â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. A recurring story about their own independence history which they can't let go off. They get off on this â¥â¥â¥â¥.. America, GET A â¥â¥â¥â¥IN' CLUE! Learn about world that is OUTSIDE of America, than the god damn close minded, civil war rebellion, â¥â¥â¥â¥ mongering, tea-throwing overboard â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, native-american massacring â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s, wholly capitalistic fat â¥â¥â¥â¥s of your own AMERICAN history..  Too long, Didn't read Game should have skippable scenes, good enough graphics for gameplay, absolutely god awful â¥â¥â¥â¥ and â¥â¥â¥â¥ american history lesson.. once again. Buy it if you want to, don't buy it if you actually like a game you can do something in.
2421	All the missions are the same and the graphics are bad.
2422	This game is beautiful, A lot better then the first one!  But it still needs work my 980 is going through hell tying to get the game to run but i am playing at   2560x1440 and get 40-52 FPS so not to bad!  Is this game woorth your money yes, Its has great lore and is kick â¥â¥â¥!  Its like a far cry/Fallout kind of style.  Oh and the gun play is great.
2423	â¥â¥â¥â¥
2424	Absolutely terrible optimization - you should be ashamed for charding money for this game.
2425	  Played it on free play weekend.. Found out this game doesn't have multiplayer... LOL LOOOOOOL. I like that they are focusing on adding a good story campaign, but come on this is a FPS.... I wont even play the campain now seeing the game lacks the most important part of a FPS ha. I am happy I decided not to just purchase it since it was on sell.
2426	I have a 970, amd 8370 and 16 gigs of ram and I'm getting 60 frames steady don't listen to the negs the game is pretty good.
2427	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and here I was thinking it couldn't be any worse than the first.  xDDDDDDDDD
2428	This fukken game... where to begin...   Let's start with the premise. It's â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. The idea that the short bus of nation states (AKA North Korea) can establish a beach head when in reality they use pointy fukk sticks and fish oil is laughable. The idea that they can be a technological powerhouse is even more â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. At first you can overlook this and kind of enjoy the parallel universe they create, but then you get in to the game and realize that this shovelware should not be anywhere anyone can touch. they put out a pile of crap for money and thankfully I waited until it was 70% off.  The story is OK to start, but as time goes on and you get deeper into the plot... you find it was written by one of those kids in the 'special needs' room who might have talent but it held back by the fact he is fukken 'tarded. The missions (lol let's just waltz in and mess stuff up' are repetitive and tiring. What little variety is there is marred by the fact they chose to exectute the dumbest ideas possible.  The pathfinding on the AI is garbage. This is what finally broke it for me. I get to play with goliath like the last game. At first I'm thinking 'oh sweet maybe I can mess stuff up...' No. It behaves more like an autistic overgrown metal toddler that whines if you shoot near it, and it's driven by some smarmy pseudo-asian chick who has as much talent behind the wheel and with a gun like... an actual asian woman.   Your allies being able to help you in a critical situation? Don't count on it. They paid as much attention to the pathfinding there as one would pay to a used paper cup being tossed in the trash.  And then glitches with vehicles... oh man. You got awful pathfinding, then you get the RC cars going and while that was actually a really cool idea it got trashed by getting stuck on stuff like... candles... yes... candles...  Then it goes kaboom from the candle in your face as you realize too late that it just isn't going anywhere. Sort of like this game.
2429	So i got it played if for maby two hours and returnd it. if it was $20 i would buy it but it felt like a bate.
2430	I have a bug where noone has heads. Wait for this one guys
2431	Not too bad, you can custmization your graphics settings.
2432	Game is garbage. I ran into 5 bugs whithen first 20 minutes. Shooting is loose and driving is wonky. I do not recommend.
2433	Only good part is throwing phones and stabing people in the face then slit their throat
2434	Cannot play game, surpass minimum specs. Completely dark screen except for hud. Right after first cut scene game goes completely dark. Avoid like the plague. Can't leave any other review until I can actually play the game.  Not even going to play this, getting refund. After seeing these other reviews can't imagine letting them keep my money. And for the troll that left the 'fix your pc' comment, get a life. My PC is fine, run every other game in my library no problem.
2435	This game â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sucks. I thought Battleborn was bad, but this game is absolutely horrible. I friggin' despise this game. The shooting mechanics SUCK. The weapons SUCK. The enemies swarm even worse than the cops in GTA. Do not buy this game. The rebels who fight alongside you only serve to get in your way and alert bases if you're trying to do stealth. Just absolutely horrible game on every single aspect. The only reason I bought this was because it's set in Philly and it really brings the city down by using Philly as its setting. You never have enough ammo in this game. I have no idea what actually kills a soldier. I've blown entire clips into someone's head and nothing happened, then I put two rounds into their legs or some other part and they fall over dead. There's also no targeting reticle on the screen, so who the hell knows if you're aiming at the target you have to aim down sights for every single shot. â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game. This is the last time I buy from a third party site. Next time I'll buy from Steam so I can get a refund when a game developer takes a â¥â¥â¥â¥ on me this badly.
2436	19hrs ingame and i finally manage to jump off a bridge to kill myself , just wanted to forget why i bought this game at full price in the first place. As i got to the bridge i see everyone is waiting in line for the same â¥â¥â¥â¥ing reason and it took me 19hrs for it to be my turn.
2437	this game is a disaster absolutely disaster, its like playing call of duty in open world mode u can go everywhere u want in the middle of war!
2438	This game is good
2439	This is a great game really good campaign and theres tons of it. Over 30 hours of campaign!!! I really think if you have the money buy this game its one of my favorite games on pc.
2440	First things first.... I have an Alienware.... I-7...256 ge-force video... blah blah blah.... It's a damn good computer worth nearly $2k...   I saw this game in the featured section.... read the description... saw the trailers... thought to myself... Hey... this looks like fun....   So I paid for the game AND season pass package... cuz I hate getting screwed by greedy developers who wanna be paid every time they take a â¥â¥â¥â¥... n also want a pat on the back BECAUSE they took a â¥â¥â¥â¥... even though their â¥â¥â¥â¥ still STINKS like â¥â¥â¥â¥.  But ... whatever.... I bought the game...    first thing I notice is.... thirty FREAKING six gig!!! 36 gig... 3 6 ... WTF?? Am I downloading the library of congress???? I immediately wonder if the game code was written in visual basic... or hieroglyphic or some other ancient forgotten language.  After 3 1/2 ridiculously long hours on a very stable high speed internet connection that easily runs WOT and multiple other FPS's.... Homefront is installed and ready to play.  So I double click the play button n wait to dive in... tick tock..... tick tock.... did I click it once?? or twice??? .... it must have been once... it's been a minute or two n still nothing... I mean .... NOTHING... a black.... blank screen.....I'll click it again..... oh ... wait.... it's starting to do something.... I see... something ... its faint.... choppy?!?!?... garbled music.... some sort of weird cut scene??? intro movie??? I think to myself.... I bought a game right???? not some narrated cartoon movie / graphic novel????  Finally after about ten minutes of watching this choppy.... blurry.... grossly out of sync audio ..... Intro???.... I get to do something.... .... .... press V.... yup.... I got to press the V button on my keyboard.... 36 gigs.... 3 1/2 hours to download and install.... ten minutes of watching a sub standard cut scene / movie / intro / pointless waste of time..... and pile of money later.... and I get to press the V button.  I don't think I've ever seen a more blatant middle finger from a game developer before.... these guys should have gone into business making high school prom videos rather than making video games...  I'd ask for my money back for this steaming piece of dogshit but I figure I'd have a better chance of winning every lottery in every city in every country.... WITHOUT buying a ticket.
2441	I do not recommend. I will rather go to jail but wont play this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. Dont waste ur time and money if you thinks it like first one, but no. If You buy it and If I found out I will find you lol
2442	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this
2443	WORST GAME OF ALL TIME!
2444	If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding cheese cake recipe you've come to the right place.  Ingredients:  1 cup digestive plain sweet biscuit crumbs 3 tablespoons sugar 3 tablespoons melted butter 40 ounces softened cream cheese 1 cup sugar 3 tablespoons flour 1 tablespoon vanilla 1 cup sour cream 4 eggs  Directions: For The base:. If you're using a dark pan, preheat the oven to 350. If you are using a shiny pan, 375. Combine the crumbs, melted butter and 3 tbsp sugar well and pat onto the bottom of a 9 inch springform pan. I also like to very very lightly butter the sides of the pan so that the cheesecake will not stick later on. Bake for 10 mins in your preheated oven and remove. Let it cool while you prepare your batter. For the batter:. Make sure everything is at room temperature. Combine sugar, cheese, flour and vanilla in a big bowl and mix on medium speed till well combined. Don't forget to scrape the bowl as you're doing this. Mix in the sour cream till its incorporated well. Then, add the eggs one by one, mixing well after each addition. Pour the batter into the springform and let it bake for 1 hour and 10 minutes After the baking time, turn off the oven and leave the door ajar. Let the cake cool in there for about 1 1/2 hours. Remove the cake and let it cool thoroughly. Refrigerate overnight. Release the sides of the springform. Eat.
2445	Doesn't support SLI. AWWWFUL.
2446	been playing for 5 min...this game is so â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up....good grafix....â¥â¥â¥â¥ game coding....first person view sucks hard....and the movement controls suck.......WHY DO THEY ALWAYS HAVE TO â¥â¥â¥â¥ UP A GOOD IDEA FOR A â¥â¥â¥â¥ING GAME!!!!
2447	It's ok     (Update) Beat the game 7.5/10 Assassin's Creed 2 part 2 - If you beat AC2 you know what I mean...          Actual review  This game is critized due to its predecessor, which is why people who cant access or own the game give so many dislikes to this game. Running this game on an Alienware X51 R2 the graphics were set on high and the game still had shading errors and 'head loss' for random characters. After changing the setings to medium or low this shoud be resolved. Gamplay wise, everything can be killed with bullets, shooting at the back of an armoured car blows with up with 1 mag. The A.I sucks the rarely runs for cover (and or) charges straight into battle, they stand and shoot. The storyline is interesting, but in 2 hours I have made little effort to pursue it, due to the fact that there is no connection between the characters and little to no interaction with you. I dont enjoy the game saves my progress, but im sure I will get used to it.  Putting all that aside, the gun modification is 'Revolutionary' (compared to fallout) considering I can turn a pistol into a Uzi. The 'sleath mechanic' is in working order, I personally love sneaking behind Norks and preforming a takedown rather than a gunfight. As for cover, peaking all work well for stealth, as blindfire keeps you in the game in firefights, aslo gotta love the Day/Night cycle. There is a slight desire to save Walker but, what is FAR more ineresting is the massive map, far larger that skyrim(with guns). It will take hours/days to explore the whole thing. The Districts are divided by color, red, yellow, and green. Each of these districts will determine if you get into a massive firefight or if you can walk to your destination. I found that being able to form a 'Strike Squad' by recruiting rebel A.I.s is a feature I have not seen since Assassin's Creed Brotherhood. I imagine as I progress in the story more and attempt the multiplayer/co-op you will start to feel like a 'Revolutionary.'   As the game sits now, its buggy, but not unplayable, the people in the USA will deal with it for 3 days while the Devs work on a patch in time for the May 20 release. Its problems from the first game can be overlooked by this new addition into a plagued series.  If I had to rate it as it is now... 7/10 - would recommend
2448	WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITHOUT WALKER  (you can do everything)  Ignore the story, the game itself is pretty mediocre but you can probably get some enjoyment out of it.
2449	Laced with bugs, rittled with hiccups and badly missing the final polish most titles are getting these days....Yet, after 30 hours I can say I enjoyed the game I played for what it was.  There was a certain charm about the game that's hard to put your finger on, like enjoying a B movie far more than you thought you would. If you go into it expecting AAA, you're in for a letdown. If you wanna play a competent shooter with something of an original story and unique weaponry, this will scratch your itch until something better comes along. I bought the game on sale for $24 and I'm happy with that. 
2450	Having just finished the game, I can comfortably say that Homefront TR was worth the price of admission. Some of the negative comments are true, I'll admit. The game plays out like an old action movie; good guys vs. bad guys, macho gunslinging, so forth and so on. But it works for the setting, and can be surprisingly deep if you look into. The gameplay is consistent and can border on repetitive, but if you enjoy loot shooters it won't disappoint. And the action and intensity are always high, with enough variance and oddball challenge (stealth, various raids, etc.) that I didn't get bored. And as major bright spots, the Philadelphia setting is rich and beautiful to look at, the enemies are satisfying to kill, and the weapons and customization are entertaining (at least for the first half). I also want to give a huge shout-out to the characters; though sometimes one-dimensional, I felt myself connected to the struggle of the story and really felt for these characters as the game went on. My one big knock would be that the weapon customization needs to be beefed up dramatically; I earned way too many points and dollars early and found that by halfway through the game I could not buy anything new with all my KPA points and had leveled up all the guns I had cared to. But if you enjoyed Far Cry or other shooters of the ilk, pick this up and have fun! DOWN WITH THE KPA!  Overall: 8/10
2451	I really like this game. When I played it it has good weapon optics you can attach to your weapons, and it has a really good combat system. It honestly reminds me of Far Cry 4 only in a city in the year of possible 2025. I also like the parkour system as well.
2452	I like this game
2453	this game was amazing, I loved it, minor issues here and there, but it makes sense as to why there are issues, I am really glad I bough this game, and I got to say, I hope thq nordic makes more content in the homefront series
2454	[I have not played co-cop]  Very enjoyable, although not without issues. Mainly the AI is not very 'I'. Enemies don't engage in tactics so there isn't much replay value. You can ask fellow rebels to join you, but not give them specific orders, so no tactics there either. The logic is sometimes strange, not to mention how the story itself is pretty odd. E.g. in yellow zones you can do extensive sabotage and then hide until authorities stop looking.  Only you can do this over and over in a fairly small scene. It would take them perhaps 1 day to search all houses, but they'll never find you in the dumpster. A mass murderer is loose but they go 'nah' after looking around for 1 min. It is a game though, so you can forgive some silly logic.  It's not particularly well optimised, but runs fine on mid-high settings in 2560 x 1440 (60hz) on my rig*. I played through the entire campaign with no game breaking bugs, and I believe many of the smaller ones have been fixed by now. The weapon customisation works really well and is fun So if you have a decent PC, enjoy these types of sandbox shooters, and don't expect too much, it might be worth it.  *i7 5820K 3.3 GHz CPU 16 GB RAM Geforce GTX 960
2455	Issues have been mostly ironed out. Solid campaign and Co-op.
2456	Ok after atleast over 10 hrs of the game i have found alot of bugs u get stuck to a building if u jump on it storyline sucks overall i give it 1/10
2457	*I've updated my review and scrapped my old review as the devs fixed all the problems.   Nooooow I must say this game is gorgeous. I was so psyched today when I got home and saw a huge update patch. I can't wait to play more now. I tried it out today and sli appears to be working, the shadow flickers are gone and the controls are so smooth. The stuttering is gone too. Wow what a good job they did fixing the issues. Could've been a bit faster, but whatever they ended up fixing everything and doing it well. As I said I'd do before once the game was fixed I now think this game is super fun and looks amazing. Thanks so much for fixing the game Devs!!!
2458	great game looks amazing :D but could do with some performance improvements
2459	The new patch runs fine.  The game isn't hard but it is a fine Far Cry-ish shooter. After an overlong opening, you are let loose in a big shooty Far Cry meets Stalker style map and tasked with going to all the icons, shooting people there, and turning red stuff blue. All while collecting more stuff for upgrades.  So basically, Far Cry. Only with some great graphics... so still Far Cry. The AI is pretty weak... so STILL Far Cry. But at least it doesn't require Uplay.
2460	I pre-ordered this game the day before it came out because I like spending money and, well, it's honestly nothing too remarkable. I remember it but nothing stood out as incredible which is a shame. I do remember liking the multiplayer more then the single player but considering nobody really plays this game anymore, nothing much there to do.  all in all, for the price now and after the recent update, I'd buy it. Good time for a couple days.
2461	Currently playing on the free weekend, but I intend to buy it after.  No graphical or performance issues for me. It seems the latest patches have fixed the game and made it very smooth.  The game itself is like a cross between Far Cry 3/4 and Red Faction: Guerilla. Early impression is to rate it 8/10.
2462	Takes forever to actually shoot anything outside of a short tutorial. Awful writing and voice acting. Shooting feels off but the game looks amazing on ultra. Bad port though. Buy if it ever goes under 10 dollars.
2463	played it for a few hours and gave up, crashes every 20 minutes very annoying, the gameplay is ok the story ok, not worth the price by a million miles, overall i can't recomend it
2464	Very fun game for a playthrough, took me about 20 hours to complete all of the content. It's a bit like Far Cry 3 or 4 if they were set in an urban environment and, as opposed to those games, doesn't outstay its welcome. If the game had been much longer, I probably wouldn't have finished it, but it's well worth a playthrough.  This game might not have ran that well on release, but I played it for the first time on 10/09/2016 during the free weekend, after it'd received a number of patches, and I didn't really have any performance issues. There the odd glitch where I'd get stuck in a piece of terrain, but that was rare enough to be only a mild annoyance.
2465	  I only heard about how bad the game runs and it's true. I get a lot of fps drops and freezes(even on low settings) which gets really annoying when you're in combat and you die because of it. When the game is running well, the game is really fun to play. The game looks amazing and it feels like I'm playing Far Cry 3 + Assassins Creed. Here are some similarities     it's open world    you can take over enemy bases to make it your own    you can blend in with the civilians or be sneaky to be undetected    customizations, loot and crafting  I didn't get to finish this game but I like it so far. Only things I didn't like about the game is that there is no keybind for holster which was annoying to reach for the key 0 after killing with my gun and the fps drops and freezes.
2466	I actually tried out this game, and at first I was like 'meh' but then after playing a bit, it seemed kinda cool. The character animations and graphics (probably one of the best looking games out there today, of course due to cryengine, and I've played Crysis series and Farcry as well) are done pretty well, although with characters dying left and right I guess it is hard to get attached to them.   So far only tried it in campaign mode, and although I didn't have much time to play it all the way, as I got to the more open world area where rebels are fighting against the Norks (North Koreans), I realized the game had a lot of exploration and customization potential. Kinda made me nostalgic for Farcry4, which I had the urge to play again (and once again amazing world and graphics).   The story I heard is meh, but its still worth playing in my opinion. Just maybe not for the full original price. For around $30, its a pretty decent price; I don't have time to play it these days so maybe I'll wait until it drops in price, as most games do over time.
2467	  A flawed game in many ways, and there are moments where I truly enjoy the game and the world its trying to convey. However sometimes I really cannot stand the bugs I get, very boring story and characters, the sound effects having mixing and audio issues. Then out of the blue I find myself enjoying sneaking and planning an attack on a squad of enemies and improvising my way out of a situation.   How much you enjoy this game will depend on your tolerance level of a games presentation, gameplay, etc. I for one can look past a lot of the issues in games, and i'm the kind of guy that found Kane &amp; Lynch 2 enjoyable to beat 4 times (coop thankfully). If you really have high expectatons for games then don't expect much out of this. You are better off playing Far Cry 4 or Crysis 3.  However the problem with the game that can effect people that might even enjoy it for what it is, is the performance. I had the game maxed with a GTX970 at 1360x768 and a FX8320 OC'd to 4.0 and got about 45-60. Sometimes it dropped to 35-50. Sadly as I got past the 3 hour point I got massive stutter for no reason.
2468	  It's not as bad as people make it out to be. Since when is being a 'Far Cry clone in a city' a bad thing? Haven't had any crashes during my 8 hours of playtime and the framerate is decent 30+ fps on my rapidly getting old hardware while the CryEngine looks pretty gorgeous (I wish Deus Ex Mankind Divided used it instead of their crappy Glacier). The game does have a lot of small bugs, though, the worst problem being the AI doing some silly things during a fight. And their dynamic AI spawning system needs a lot more work - enemies, friendlies and civilians spawn out of nowhere 20 meters from you, it just doesn't feel right.  I especially liked the second area being a stealth sandbox, you crawl around the back alleys hiding from patrols and running away on the first side of trouble. It was a shame it quickly got safe and turned into the usual run around and shoot gameplay.  Gonna wait for heavier discounts and buy it then. 
2469	  I've only checked it as free because i have played the free weekend. Right, so the game runs fine there is the occasional stutter but thats when things are loading in. The game feels like farcry / second son were you unlock zones by wiping out the enemy, once you have done that it become a base were you can upgrade and collect 'jobs'; jobs are sidequests were you for e.g kill 20 enemies with an assult rifle. There are a few large zones which get harder so there's a decent amount to do. The game isn't as horrible as the reviews says it is, its just a tad average and nothing special.
2470	  - Bugs - FPS - Inadequate NPCs 10/10 one shots   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoMVpuW9dhU 
2471	  I played the game during the free weekend. This game is a perfect fusion of Farcry, Crysis, Freedom Fighters, Metro just without their charm. The problems which I noticed were some weird clipping bug on some doors &amp; fences and some stuttering while saving the game. Other than that it gave me a steady 60-70 FPS. But most importantly it was fun while playing and I'll probably be getting this in future when its on sale.   My Rating: 6/10
2472	I think this game has gotten a rotten deal, its not as bad as the majority seems to hate it!? Its a solid good game, and is much better than the first game, which although doesnt say much as that ghame was a very poor one! THis game looks GREAT, it plays GREAT, it is very well optimized. My GTX780M laptop can run this game 60fps solid, no problem! And when you get to the next 'part of town' with the subway, the game changes, from a shooter to almost a more strategic game, where you must hide to survive instead of shooting youre way out.   I think this game is much better than many other â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ games that got a better deal, and you shouldnt hate this just because you had too high unrealistic expectations or something childish like that, or just you poor morons that jump on the hate train because everyone else is!?   GUys, give this game a chance, its a triple A game, high budget game, that feels has a high production value, quality! Good engine, good graphics, good sounds, good voice acting. Its a solid game, I have not finished it yet. BUt I give it 3.5 of 5 or (78%) (A good game!)  Give it a chance, or just leave it, but dont hate it without trying it!
2473	The new patch runs fine.  The game isn't hard but it is a fine Far Cry-ish shooter. After an overlong opening, you are let loose in a big shooty Far Cry meets Stalker style map and tasked with going to all the icons, shooting people there, and turning red stuff blue. All while collecting more stuff for upgrades.  So basically, Far Cry. Only with some great graphics... so still Far Cry. The AI is pretty weak... so STILL Far Cry. But at least it doesn't require Uplay.
2474	I pre-ordered this game the day before it came out because I like spending money and, well, it's honestly nothing too remarkable. I remember it but nothing stood out as incredible which is a shame. I do remember liking the multiplayer more then the single player but considering nobody really plays this game anymore, nothing much there to do.  all in all, for the price now and after the recent update, I'd buy it. Good time for a couple days.
2475	  I got this game on the free weekend (sept 2016) and it was a BLAST!   Steam's review system should document if the reviewer's system meets specs and has up to date drivers (or at least if the reviewer claims they do), because I think a lot of people grabbed a free game hoping it'd run on a sub-spec system and they lashed out at the game when it didn't. Why else would someone make a complaint that isn't even legit... 'too few guns?' It has at least pistol, pnematic pistol, smg, crossbow, blunderbuss, AR, battle rifle, LMG, shotgun, limpet gun, and RPG. Add to that 4 types of thrown weapons (incendiary, explosive, hack tool, distractor) each with 4 subtypes, total 16. Plus knife, bolt cutters, flashlight...  With the difficulty on recruit mode it was non-stop action. I'm sure more stealth is needed at higher diffuculties. Free-running though controlled zones looking for targets of opportunity like equipment sabotage targets and lone soldiers to silent-takedown... jumping from scaffolding to rooftops and through upper floor windows, looting valuables... frantically looking for a dumpster or portapotty to hide in... what's not to love? It's like Mirror's Edge meets Far Cry. Plenty of side missions can be done in any order or ignored as you like. It took 16 hours for the main mission and about half the side missions, none of the job missions, and very few of the flash missions (optional missions that appear without warning).  I love the game's moral choices... imagine you are an operative in an occupied zone on an important mission and you get an opportunity to save some civilians getting a beatdown from bully occupiers, but only by blowing your cover. Take the chance or sacrifice them... clock's ticking! Will you use remote explosives blindly with the possibility an innocent will walk by them?  The characters are well fleshed out. Dana's a complete psychopath, the doc has his own priorities, reasonable characters all have different outlooks on the occupation, the NPC chatter is diverse and on topic, and I didn't see the game re-use any faces for different people, very well done. The graphics are amazing - at one point while hiding behind a dirty old dumpster next to a chain fence with ivy growing on it I felt like I was looking at a real photo.  I had 2 crashes to desktop during the my entire 16 hour campaign. Core i7, 16gb, GTX970.
2476	korean hunting simulator... I love that crossbow  + -Great atmosphere and concept -Graphic, details, rain  -Weapon customization on the go  -Awesome animations and cutscenes  - -AI is derping out... sometimes  -I would appreciate more weapon customizations -Bugs and glitches, NPC got stuck and i couldn't get past him... fixed on checkpoint reset  Speechless guy shooting KPA with 'Real American Steel'   9/10
2477	  Like a really â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ far cry but with worse weapon handling
2478	Really uninteresting follow up to Homefront and the gunplay is inredibly boring, the worst sin for a FPS.
2479	  I downloaded and started playing Friday night, Septemeber 9th, 2016. It took several minutes to find a full party of 4. I have a strong internet connection (V.Fios), which meant nobody was online. I played online for about 4 hours with the same 3 guys.  Saturday, Septemeber 10th, I played the campaign. They throw you right in the middle of the action but fail to make me care about the frequent and tedious cutscenes.  This played very similarly to Far Cry and Dishonored with elements of Assassin's Creed and Fallout 4. I did not notice a single unique feature in this game that wasn't borrowed from another popular game. Because of these, and the lackluster storyline, I was disappointed with how familiar it felt.  tl;dr Don't bother.
2480	  A technical disaster from beginning to end. Performance issues throughout with significant performance issues during night time sections hampering already bland, cookie cutter gameplay. Missions cribbed from Far Cry, headshots that don't kill in one blow, and silencers that are pointless until you upgrade your weapon.   Typically, developers make sure their games are at their best before putting on a free weekend. Not following this line of thinking is the only really revolutionary thing about Homefront The Revolution.
2481	  I've played 16hrs so far during the promotion this weekend and although I did spend some time in the campaign I spent most of my time playing the multiplayer coop mode.    I enjoyed the game very much and was glad for the chance to try it out.   
2482	I think this game has gotten a rotten deal, its not as bad as the majority seems to hate it!? Its a solid good game, and is much better than the first game, which although doesnt say much as that ghame was a very poor one! THis game looks GREAT, it plays GREAT, it is very well optimized.

2483	I actually like this game. Graphics are great, game mechanics a mix. Lots of stuff lifted from Far Cry and Crysis. The AI is kind of dumb and Iâm not sure why (worked pretty well in Crysis). If you liked Far Cry and Crysis, and willing to give it a chance (read low expectations and allow for some time in the game) you may end up enjoying it (moderately). There are still some problems after patch 1.06, but no deal-breakers in my view. I have hopes for patch 2.0 which is supposed to come out in August. Recommended under $40. The current DLCs = money grab. I'm curious about the expansions, there is potential... We'll see if they even gonna happen...
2484	  Like a really â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ far cry but with worse weapon handling
2485	Really uninteresting follow up to Homefront and the gunplay is inredibly boring, the worst sin for a FPS.
2486	  Not a bad FPS and while I dont intend on buying it after the free weekend, I would recommend it if it stays in the 20 dollar price range as there seems to be plenty of content in the base game.  Gameplay-wise, it starts off a bit chaotic after the overly long opening scene with tons of radio chatter and calls for help lighting up the HUD so much, I would suggest disabling most of the prompts for not only immersion but also an enjoyable less intrusive experience.  The game looks great and there is no doubt an improvement from the 1st title and it also plays very smoothly on modest hardware so you should be able to find your system sweet spot with a tweak here and there.
2487	Now, i enjoy playing this game, but its filled with bugs. I enjoy the combat, the takedown animations and the gurilla style warfare. But damn, so many flaws. There are points in this game, where you think 'What the **** is going on?'. It can be from the AI bugging out, not spotting you, the fact that you are the only one required to wear a gasmask at a certain point and so on.... Logic has been thrown out the window completly with this game. But still, i enjoy the game. Even though its rage inducing. I dont recommend buying it!
2488	  The game is good. I beat it in 8 hours during the free weekend. I would say it's worth $20 or less. My main issue with the story is the idea that North Korea is so advanced in technology and military warfare. It's almost laughable. Russians or the Chinese would have been more believable. Good game otherwise. I would give this a 6/10.
2489	  Homefront the Revolution...  Well to start, multiplayer is broken on most maps (See edit). Terrain doesn't spawn in, audio glitches, etc. Customization is quite fun, but to advance in it you have to play the same glitched maps. The only map that isn't broken for me is the Vehicle escort. (Can't recall the name)  The campaign is a different story, for the most part, the main story missions are quite good and mostly enjoyable. Though it is plagued by some rather terrible design choices. *****SPOILER WARNING*****  You play as Brady, a new recruit to the Revolution. Your Revolution buddies get murdered by the KPA etc ect. Anywho, you get rescued by Walker, the leader of the Revolution, A couple boring capture the zone quests later and boom you take Phillidelphia. Obviously this is not all the game has to offer, one particularly good part is when you steal a Goliath, a armored tank. The ending is quite rewarding, with some of your friends being killed off in a Game of Thrones style.  *****Spoiler over*****  Now, the one main downside is aweful, unresponsive, unreliable, parkour. You will often find yourself frustrated by trying to jump from place to place. Mix that with horrible capture the district quests, and you have a one-way ticket to Rage quit.  Overall its a pretty decent game, maybe, MAYBE pick it up if its on sale for 10$ or less. But for 40$? Pass on it and pick up a game like Far Cry 3, which it clearly has borrowed heavily from. I have to not recommend it due to the pricepoint, and horrible design choices, but on sale, it is quite fun to play.  ***Edit*** I guess playing the game the next day fixed it? Parkour is still unresponsive though. They did do quite well optimizing it.  So maybe get it for 20USD.
2490	  massive fan of the first game and enjoyed the bit i played on a free weekend but the technical issues that are still present along side bland story and janky shooting makes this a sorry state to paly a game wish it was mcuh better.
2491	Wow am I faving fun with this one. I'm really not sure what people were expecting but if you like FarCry you will love this.
2492	seems like any issues that were in place have been resolved. I am having a great time running through the world shooting and blowing things up, while scrounging for valuables to sell. I have no complaints. Given the history with this games development, what we have now is playable, and to me at least, fun.
2493	  i got problem in screen game in black screen i try much things but dosen't work all my games work good in my GTX 970
2494	Amazing, really really good  it is worth it, and in case anyone else had this issue, if you try to load, and it wont work, load up a more later save and then it should be all good :D  Overall: 8 / 10
2495	so much promise and yet this game is absolutely abysmal. its faux open world is such a let down. in a game where they essentially cloned far cry they left out all the good stuff that made far cry great. the stealth and hiding mechanics are atrocious. enemies know where u are at all times as soon as u peek out they automatically are drawn to your location in fire fights. so using tactics are totally out the window. in a game that requires you not alert the entire kpa, the only weapon you can supress is a pistol or smg with â¥â¥â¥â¥ damage? such a let down of a game. no skill tree and the 'perks' from buying gear are essentially useless. dont waste your money or wait for a sale. the co op is so so. the bugs are awful. slow down, lag totally unoptimized. the whole game is a big disappointment. speak about a lackluster finale. the finale is a cutscene which you have no control over, you fight no one. your team dispatches all the enemies before you get there and the computer takes over for you shooting and killing enemies as you run through the cut scene.
2496	The story is amazing and deep and the visuals of Homefront The Revolution are phenomenal. I enjoyed going through and capturing strike points and doing all the missions and overall just cant really describe in depth of what I love about this game. The best part I really love about it is its atmosphere, It kinda gives off a Infamous Second Son vibe with the KPA checkpoints just like it is in Infamous Second Son with the D.U.P checkpoints. The only thing that kinda sucked about this game is that after you complete the story mode you cant free roam afterwards instead if you resume playing single player after you have beat the game then its gonna have you do the last mission again. In general this is a great game and I recommend anyone to give it a try! Its worth it.
2497	I want to like this game. I haven't pplayed it very long at all but I am noticing some very VERY irritating things already.  Firstly, the POOR optimization. I am running significantly powerful hardware: Titan X SLI (Which game does not support) 6700K 3 Samsung 2TB SSDs 32GB of DDR4 Ram With that said, on 1440p, settings maxed out I can expect as low as 30ish frames in some areas. For me, 30 frames is not acceptable, despite it being 'playable'.  Secondly, the ridiculous clipping. When I first got rescued, I could see through Walker and onto the floor beneath him.  Then, he gave me a really cool phone, which I decided I would put my fingers through as I admired them.  Thirdly... And this is more of a personal thing... But I like to be able to see my avatar's body in game. And this game does it, but does it in a silly way. I look down and it looks like I have jutted my hips forwards, keeping my feet under them, and then slide my upper torso just straight back. Literally an impossible position to achieve as you would likely sever your spinal cord.   Onto the actual game though...  Clearly I haven't played much. But my first impressions are this: It has potential, I really like the setting. I want to like this game. The gunplay is meh. I couldn't seem to really hit anything with my pistol at any kind of range (Not a FPS noob, love FPS, not to shabby at them) so not sure if the game just hates the pistol and wants you to use it CQB exlcusively and not even just short ranges.  I want to like this game, I really do, but because the state of its release, it needs some cleaning up before I can recommend it.    EDIT 09/07/2016  Ok, so they've smoothed out performance quite a bit and everything seems stable. I still haven't messed with story mode but I do enjoy Resistance mode a great deal.  Gunplay takes some getting used to, but all in all its ok. Not spectacular, but definitely not bad.
2498	personally while playing this game i really enjoyed it, the gameplay is smooth and the characters dont seem out of place, even comenting on the characters watch being stoneage. the gunplay could be a little more favourable as the assault rifle is a poor choice early on but can be made extremely powerfull. the campaign for me was far to short with missions not trully tieing into the previous rather sparking off into another direction, but that is war. so overall i belive this is a very good yet underrated game that deserves a bit more attention
2499	This game trys as hard as it can to suck. Glitches glitches glitches. Terrible save system. WIthout a very serious update this game is worth about $9.99! Skip it.
2500	After patches and such, this game is pretty awesome. I really enjoyed it. The action was intense and it was a real challange in some parts. I now strongly recommend this game.
2501	I'm 4 hours in and I've freed up the first area. So far I'm having enough fun to stick around. Not a great game, nut not bad either.  So far I haven't experienced any problem at all. Everything runs smoothly and I have yet to see my first bug.  The story isn't great, the graphics are nice, sound and music are decent enough, combat is okay (you can go stealth if you want), AI is decent enough, game mechanics are fine (not as good as for example Far Cry's, but good enough).  Just your (not so?) average 6 or 7 out of 10 game that's certainly worth it's current price of 24 or 30 Euro.  EDIT I have to change the thumbs up to a thumbs down. Just now I encountered the same game breaking 'bug' for the second time. I'm talking about the buggy situation where you have to clear a 'hotspot' form the remaining hostiles ... but they just keep on respawning making it impossible to complete the side mission. The first time I just got very lucky; after some time I was able to clear the hostiles and trigger the all-clear event. Just now I got a situation where luck wouldn't help me ... and I gave up.  Deleting local content ...
2502	Runs smooth,and love playing without the hub turned on. Single player game that is not 80% cinematics and 20% hand held game play, cough 'COD'
2503	For less than 30 bucks, its a pretty fun openworld shooter. Only grips at the moment is with some of the bugs and lack of endgame replayability.
2504	Ok after atleast over 10 hrs of the game i have found alot of bugs u get stuck to a building if u jump on it storyline sucks overall i give it 1/10
2505	[I have not played co-cop]  Very enjoyable, although not without issues. Mainly the AI is not very 'I'. Enemies don't engage in tactics so there isn't much replay value. You can ask fellow rebels to join you, but not give them specific orders, so no tactics there either. The logic is sometimes strange, not to mention how the story itself is pretty odd. E.g. in yellow zones you can do extensive sabotage and then hide until authorities stop looking.  Only you can do this over and over in a fairly small scene. It would take them perhaps 1 day to search all houses, but they'll never find you in the dumpster. A mass murderer is loose but they go 'nah' after looking around for 1 min. It is a game though, so you can forgive some silly logic.  It's not particularly well optimised, but runs fine on mid-high settings in 2560 x 1440 (60hz) on my rig*. I played through the entire campaign with no game breaking bugs, and I believe many of the smaller ones have been fixed by now. The weapon customisation works really well and is fun So if you have a decent PC, enjoy these types of sandbox shooters, and don't expect too much, it might be worth it.  *i7 5820K 3.3 GHz CPU 16 GB RAM Geforce GTX 960
2506	this game was amazing, I loved it, minor issues here and there, but it makes sense as to why there are issues, I am really glad I bough this game, and I got to say, I hope thq nordic makes more content in the homefront series
2507	So I would like to update my review to this game. Originally I said i wouldnt suggest it to anyone. I totally would on steam sale lol. but also i think they mustve done some updating because the weapons sound alot better. The game has a better feel to it than it did. check it out. great graphics as well!
2508	For less than 30 bucks, its a pretty fun openworld shooter. Only grips at the moment is with some of the bugs and lack of endgame replayability.
2509	  come join us i want more this games
2510	Missions are boring, irritating stuttering, awful and half â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ stealth and gun physics. 3/10
2511	I LOVE THIS GAME! If you love Far Cry 4, you should love this too! ***BEWARE*** See below....  Pros:   - Loved the story that carried over from the first game, but I'm also a huge Red Dawn fan!  - Beautiful open world if you have a highend GPU. Looked great across 3 monitors.  - AI was challenging, Gameplay was simply FUN!  - They used CRYENGINE - Haven't hated a game yet that used the CRYENGINE.  - Game within a game - Find the Video Machine, put in a token, and you get a whole other FPS game!  - BEST PART is the VR controlled RC car with explosives. I couldn't get enough! Used it every change I could.  Cons:  - When sniping at a distance, bad guys just keep appearing out of thin air.  - The motorcyle gets stuck occasionally on some of the puzzles multiple times (that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ me off most of all).  - Some of the puzzles didn't make sense or the clues lied. 'The tunnel is near the wall'. NO, the tunnel is in one of the houses, in the basement, a block away from the wall. (Yes, Spoiler. But it is a pain to find)  - Job board tasks were not worth doing and not needed for extra cash. They could have created better jobs.  - Biggest con is below!  *** BEWARE*** While the game warns you that once you begin the last mission you can't go back. It really means, 'Finish this last part and the game is OVER!. You can NEVER go back finish off any areas you missed, EVER. Unlike 'Far Cry 4' where you can keep playing, after ending the campaign, and enjoy the open world finishing off any jobs or sections, this doesn't let you. A big disappointment. Just DON'T commit to the final part of the game until you have finished everything else.   Now, I'm going to go back in and replay the game a few more times. An easy 150 hour game for me.
2512	Superior to the first game in the Homefront series, if you are a fan of Far Cry, Crysis, or even Half-Life this game will be very familiar, picture this game as being a more downscaled version of Far Cry.  Some technical issues to watch out for. Game should run fine on a low - mid level pc.  8/10
2513	I'm assuming it must have been some pretty horrid optimization and/or bugs that had folks giving this game such poor reviews when it first released. Bought it during the 2016 Winter sale and have had a bug-free, smooth playing experience.  The game itself is great. It takes the Far Cry approach to the open world but pulls it off much better in my opinion. Has yet to feel repetitive or stale and despite people knocking it, have really been enjoying the story. If you grew up watching movies like the original Red Dawn you will love the overall feel and atmosphere.   Visually it's excellent. The Crytek engine is on full display and everything from the lighting to the characters is well above average. The gameplay is great fun. I have really enjoyed the way they mix stealth and action, leaving the player great freedom in approaching most situations. Watching the Norks abuse and kill your Countrymen adds a nice layer of satisfaction when you sneak up on them and plunge a knife into back or neck.  It was about $12 during the sale, which is a ridiculous amount of fun for the money. I could have spent $30 and been plenty happy, hell, I could have probably spent $60 and not been upset with the purchase.  Have yet to try online co-op, but I bought this game for the story and the single player atmosphere more than anything.   Great sequel to the original Homefront that is better than the previous game in every way on the single player front.  8/10 - would stab a Nork in the face again for telling my countryman to lick their boot
2514	  Full Disclosure: I bought this game at release for X-Box one at the time of release and played it on normal up until the last mission and it bugged in such a way that I could not complete it without restarting from the beginning. Because of this I took it back to EB Games Canada within a week and got a full refund.  Now, I enjoyed the story immensly up until that point and, because the game was on sale in the winter 2016 Steam sale with the season pass, I decided I'd give it another go, if nothing else I wanted to see how the main game ended.  After playing through the main campaign I have to say I loved it. They've fixed it up and it plays perfectly. I haven't noticed any game breaking bugs. I've also played through the two DLC currently available and I have to say that I cannot wait for the final installment.  It got off to a VERY shakey start, but it has turned into a pleasure to play for the price I paid during the sale. I cannot wait for the next game in the franchise. If you're reading this at the time time of the sale I'm speaking of (or cheaper).. buy it.. it's worth it and has hours of entertainment (look at my played time).
2515	A solid game, plays like Far Cry but in a city.
2516	Game was not worth when it initially came out. Now they patched a lot of the issues.  Gameplay is a bit repetitive, but has that Far Cry feel to it.   TL;DR Good terrorist simulator.
2517	Great game with great gameplay. I heard that there were some issues upon release, but if that were true they sure aren't present today. Loved the story mechanics of the game. Would say the game is worth $40 if not more.  Only thing I didn't like as a Homefront fan is the way they modified the back story and threw the entire original game out. It's pretty much present day America where China is North Korea.
2518	So Far I 've clocked 3 hr on this game..... I just can say worth the sales price and the game play is fun.
2519	Fun for $15. Plus you get the expansion pass too. It looks great, runs well. Gun play is meh but I enjoy it.
2520	Yes, this RPG is 'old-school'. And believe me: I *know* old-school computer RPG's, which I've been enjoying since the Commodore Amiga days. So, I know what kind of hardcore design and grueling challenge and slogging gameplay I'm in for, with an RPG like this. But there's good old-school, and there's bad old-school - and this is *bad* old-school.  The best qualities of this game are its story and dialogs, and its dark, gritty atmosphere. The artwork and music are good, for an old-school game. The turn-based combat is okay (though I've seen far better). But it's all ruined (for me, anyway) by the ridiculous numbers of restorative potions you have to guzzle during and after combat, even if you play on the game's 'easy' setting. Not even in Diablo did you have to use and manage *this* many potions. There's the ubiquitous health potions and mana potions, but there's also stamina potions, which are the worst offenders.  Just about every action (especially the combat actions) requires a certain amount of stamina - and your reservoir gets used up quickly. (Running out of stamina in the middle of combat is a frequent and dire problem.) Once you've cleared an immediate area of opponents, you can stand around and do nothing, which will slowly regenerate your stamina. (Or you can switch to walking around at a snail's pace, but then your stamina regeneration is lowered to a glacial pace.) But there's no 'rest' key to press, to speed up the process. There's no 'camp' option, either. Nor can you trek back to town and sleep at an inn. (Although you can pay the priest there to restore all your health, stamina, and mana, but that gets to be prohibitively expensive, and he's way on the other side of town.)  So, you the player literally have to sit there, staring at the screen and waiting for your character's stamina to regenerate. Oh, you can go take a quick bathroom break or go grab something to snack on, or whatever, while your stamina regenerates, but the number of times you'll find yourself having to do this is beyond ridiculous. Really, the game pretty much *forces* you to rely on stamina potions - and lots of them.  There's also a heavy (albeit lesser) reliance on health potions and mana potions, and those too you'll have to upkeep in your inventory by the dozens as you continually burn through them. (And if you have a henchman or two, fighting for you, you'll burn through the health and stamina potions even faster! Because they need them too, as often as your character does.) You'll end up dedicating a third or more of your ample inventory just for upkeeping potions.  Eventually, you'll find magic items (rings, amulets, belts, etc.) that can speed up (by, say, 20%) the regeneration of your stamina, which helps a little. Other items will even allow you to ever so slowly regenerate health and mana. (Otherwise, health and mana do *not* regenerate at all!!) But those items are hard to find and prohibitively expensive, the first dozen levels or so of your character's progression. And even when you do acquire them, you'll continue having to burn through potions by the scores as opponents get tougher and exploration gets deeper and more protracted.  Well, after around 10 hours of gameplay (including trying first with a paladin and then re-starting with a rogue), I think I'm going to toss aside this computer RPG and move on to the next one in my queue. I've played more than enough of this type of game to know if it's worthwhile, and for me this one is not.
2521	Inquisitor, a dark medieval role-playing indie game that had been in development for 13 years before its official release. Therefore, you can expect to find the traditional indie RPG stuff with slightly better graphics (since the developers had time to improve them).  Let's start off with character creation. You can choose among 3 main characters: the Paladin, the Priest and the Thief. Each one has his own unique story despite the huge amount of customization in attributes and skills you have. Now, about physical appearance you can't change much. You are presented with 4 faces (or portraits) for each character and you can't neither change facial features nor the character's body details. Despite this fact, you'll realize that the absence of these possible changes won't even be noticed. You won't even be able to tell how the face of the characters look like and since every single item that you equip on your character is shown as you play, you can't tell if he has large shoulders, hairy legs or if he lacks a finger. Still in character creation, as I mentioned, you'll choose to use skill points and attribute points. But that's not it! There are 7 books of magic in total and depending on the character you choose, you can pick some of those schools of magic. There are 4 permitted schools of magic and 3 forbidden ones. I won't get in much detail here so you can explore this for yourself. You can, of course, choose your character's name and you're ready to go!  Inquisitor will take you to a fictional God's Kingdom on Earth and you're sent to Hillbrandt to investigate something for the Holy Mother Church. The way you do it is completly up to you. You can be a neutral investigator, you can follow every single God's rule during the Inquisition and you can even be an evil guy probably just looking forward to torturing innocent people for his own amusement. Yes, there's torture in this game! There are 4 torturing devices you can choose to use during the game, you can use all of them on the same person if you wish. But if you want to keep your allignement on the Good side, be sure that the culprit hasn't given you the information you want and that he's not innocent, otherwise you'll be hated even by your superiors.  This game is divided in 3 fantastic acts and it has a very deep story that will immerse you pretty easily. Now, the concept of story telling is based on dialog that you'll have to read. And trust me, you DO NEED to read everything! If you're expecting a game where you'll have shiny things to tell you that's where you need to go or that's what you need to find; if you're expecting colourful arrows on the ground or even someone telling you exactly where you need to go, then be advised, this game is not for you even if you like reading a lot. You'll be lost most of the times, not knowing where to go, so one thing you can do is explore the areas and dungeons hoping to find what you want. There lots of quests for you to complete and those quests are so well connected that the world feels really alive. You'll have main story-line quests and, of course, side-quests to complete. There are tons of dungeons and many areas, lots of monsters that keep respawning from time to time and heretics! The game is expected to last 150 hours or so to finish but it'll take you much longer than that, since you' re the one who has to do all the thinking about where to go or what to do in spite of having an in-game journal to help you slightly.  Graphically speaking, the world is beautiful despite all the evil and Hell spawns you'll fight. The areas are so detailed that sometimes I felt like just sitting back and enjoying the view. The artwork of the dungeons is gothic-like and it isn't like anything I've ever seen. The music is phenomenal and very well adapted to the areas you're in. The sound in general feels very realistic and the quality is so good that you feel like there really are flies orbiting your head!  The combat mechanics though are pretty standard and straight forward. There's nothing new to it. You have melee weapons of different types, ranged weapons, shields and throwing daggers/axes, lots of magic seals to use and spells from the various schools of magic you can learn. There's also the brewing skill for you to master if you're into that kind of stuff. If not, just buy the potions from the village merchants and you're good to go. You can learn the smithing skill to and many utility ones you'll find for yourself.  Now one thing that I both loved and hated was the difficulty level of Inquisitor. The game is insanely difficult, specially in combat! And that's fine, we all like some great challenges once in a while. But the most annoying thing for me was the dungeon difficulties. Those places sometimes are huge and they're filled with monters you've never dreamed about and despite that the 'boss' monters can kill your whole party with a single spell and you don't have any time to react at all! Imagine one of those 'big bosses' surrounded by 5 of the most difficult monsters of that dungeon....Yeah, exactly, pretty impossible. So, in that regard, I feel like sometimes the difficulty level of the game is unnecessary.  So, my personal rating for Inquisitor is 8/10! It is indeed the best of its genre in my opinion and the only big downside I can find is the insane difficulty that sometimes is just too much to bear. Even though the character creation is not special, it is pretty acceptable and it doesn't even influence anything at all (speaking of character appearence, of course). Now, go to the Realm of Inquisitor and uphold the laws of God in His Kingdom on Earth as you see fit! The heretics must be stopped otherwise the Holy Mother Church will and that can never happen!   Reviewer's note: when you level up, just press C already (character menu) and if you want to pick items up, press Alt, so you can see them easily by reading their names.
2522	I've only finished the first act so far, but that already has taken me nearly 20 hours to get through and the amount of reading and the depth of this game are fantastic. I definitely look forward to playing the rest of this game and would recommend it to any fan of neo-retro video games or serious role-playing game fans.
2523	Hardcore. Not for those with short attention spans, no time, weak willed or the illiterate. The amount of text and pace of the game might rankle some but persist and you'll find yourself enjoying a very well written and awesomely atmospheric iso RPG that while unforgiving means you feel genuine satisfaction when progressing the storyline or clearing an area of enemies.
2524	Inquisitor looks old, plays like and a 90's RPG and will be spewing very long blocks of text at your face. If that doesn't turn your off, keep reading because there's much more to it than that.  You can kind of guess this game is going to take some time to finish from the get go and that impression would be right, I'm only around 20 hours in and there's a lot to do and a lot to see. In the first act, you're helping the local branch of the church to solve several cold cases of mysterious murders and unexplained disappearances, tracking down heretics and allies of the devil. The game takes the form of a really old school isometric RPG, not too dissimilar from Arcanum. You will be wandering into an original world mixing a middle-age central europe setting with medieval-fantastic aspects. Think 'The Name of the Rose' meets 'Lord of the Rings'.  The game will have you speaking to a lot of people to fill your journal with information and clues and to collect evidence, picking and using skill from your character sheet, selecting and equipping spells and managing your inventory. While the mouse driven interface can get a little bit confusing, hiding some vital parts of your character sheet under what looks like very small tabs on a 1080p monitor, you can use (and definitely should learn) the keyboard bindings for most actions.  The variety of items you will come across is just mind numing. From potions and spell scrolls, to weapons and armors, all items have different levels of quality, need to be repaired and maintained in working order, and combined to ensure your survival against the spawn of the devil and the creatures of the wilderness.  The combat, while on par with the 90's tech powering the engine, is nothing really exciting and can get quite frustrating if you're trying to use skills and spells on top of your trusty sword. The special effects (confusion, blindness...) while incredibly creative, can be very off-putting to say the least.  What really sets this title apart from the modern games that pretend to be RPG's today is the writing. Sure there's a lot of it but it's both well written (or should I say translated) but is also engaging an immersive. It's likely that you will want to know more about the world... and the NPC's will be more than happy to tell you all you may want to learn. I found the conversations with certain characters to be a reward in and of itself.  The music is nothing short of amazing, taking a really classical route with an early baroque feel, far removed from the generic post romantic and modern orchestral music. A choice fitting the universe in many ways.  It should be said that Inquisitor also does a better job at analysing the psyche of its character and reflecting some of the dark parts of the human condition much better than any other hipsterish indie non-game. Most of that exploration flows organically with the gameplay, the setting and the artistic direction of the game. Just for that I think anyone with a passing interest in character development in games should at least take a look at the first act of this game, just to see how to do it right.  I love this game and I would recommend it to anyone loving old-school RPG's, however, remember the introduction of this review, it might not be your thing and that's totally understandable.
2525	  âThe most powerful weapon on earth is the human soul on fire.â    Inquisitor is a classic role-playing game experience that stands out from the usual RPG genre, because it does not hold your hand in any way. The storyline and most quests in this game provide only a few clues how to solve them. It will be up to you to collect all the information from the locals and connect the dots, until you have a clear picture of the situation.  The characters you meet alongside your journey will test your integrity, righteousness and moral standards. And on several occasions you will find yourself in the position, in your role as an Inquisitor, where you have to decide between the right way and the just way.  The strong role-playing aspects of each of the three classes in combination with the religious &amp; mystical elements create an authentic medieval atmosphere, including fantasy creatures in form of demons and other hellspawns. What this game lacks in graphics it gains twofold in detailed descriptions of events and NPCs throughout the game.  While it provides the classic hack &amp; slash features, the combat is pretty simple and straight forward with little tactical depth. No voice acting, an inferior inventory system (e.g. no potion stacking) and the partially unbalanced combat mechanics should be mentioned as further disadvantages of this classic RPG.  Overall, if you are willing to get over the initial hurdles of an antiquated graphical presentation and some inconsistencies during combat, there is a very deep and enjoyable game with a wealth of content available for you. And there is something rather refreshing about being an Inquisitor that is not the good Samaritan.    Amusing quotes:    âThe worst monsters of all are the people, Father. Of course you could admit that orcs and other hellspawns are Satanâs brats longing to dip their fangs and claws into human flesh, but believe me, people are much more dangerous. The people who cast away faith and are worshipping idols, mammon, fornication and bloodshed. When you meet an orc you know your lifeâs in danger. But when you meet a man, you canât be sure although heâs smiling today, he wonât cold heartedly murder your own daughter tomorrow. Believe me, Father, beware of people!â    Achievements:    The game has no Steam achievements.    Chronology:    Inquisitor (PC) Role-playing game + hack &amp; slash  (Dark Fantasy) â 2009
2526	Inquisitor provides one of those rare experiences of satisfaction and achievement in gaming. It doesnât hold your hand, it doesnât overcompensate for impatience, and it is not a title a small child will be successful in. What it does have is brilliant atmosphere, an engrossing story, intricate plots and intrigue and requires you to really think about what your next move should be. The obvious time and effort the developers put into the title completely makes you forgive them for the often frustrating combat mechanics and steep learning curve. Inquisitor is the Dark Souls of isometric RPGs.
2527	I took a long look at some of the negative reviews and if you have read those there are some things you should consider. First off there is quite the learning curve to this game so if somone has less than 40 hours played I wouldn't trust their positive or negative review.  When I first got this game I spent about 20 hours starting, then stopping, then picking it up again. I restarted several times (an ARP curse of mine) finally, nearly, beating the first act with the thieft on hard difficulty. I reformatted my computer shortly after, lost my save file and hadn't played the game in almost a year. About two weeks ago I started a paladin on Normal difficulty and am about half way through the second act and going strong.  This game presents one of the most mysterious, yet compelling stories out of any game I've ever played. This is its biggest pro in my opinion. Once understood and givin proper time, the combat is okay. Not great, but not bad. I'll give a list of pro's and con's:  Pros: -Story is deep, mysterious and as you uncover more secrets extremely rewarding. -Well written and well thought out. -Unique Spells that serve you in interesting ways. -Unique and well written music. -If you actually read the novel length dialogue, characters are MOSTLY interesting.   Cons: -Loot system is on the con side of things. Pretty generic and seems, so far, that there are things to look for and things to ignore. -If they are going to leave the potion system the way it is, please, just please, let me stack them. -Duribility on gear is poorly designed and should be revisited imo. -Buggy. Nothing game breaking but enough to force you to save and restart the game a few times during a session.  Conclusion: If your looking for a unique story, good music, and decent gameplay arpg give this a shot. If you can be patient through the learning curve you'll be happy you gave this game a shot. It offers many hours of gameplay. I would guess im about half way through (could be off there) and I'm about 45 hours in. 7/10.
2528	Inquisitor is a stange game. Aesthetically  it is not particularly pleasing, considering we have titles like Diablo III, Tochlight, Torchlight 2, Grim dawn, Titan quest etc. Visually speaking this is comparable to Diablo I and II and even then that may be a stretch. This game contains insuferable amounts of lore, text after text of information that honestly most of us could do without. However, It wins on it's story and the intrigue the story brings. The amount of control you have over how to manage your charecter is nice. The ability to customize stats and skills is refreshing when playing an on rails AARPG like Diablo III.  I would recomend this for those of you who are not scared of hard games with a steep learning curve. Graphics are also a downfall so don't expect it to look pretty. The story (if you love story driven games) Is fantastic and is its primary selling point.  Ticklepants
2529	Inquisitor is a great old-school RPG game for those who wish to step in the boots of an medieval inquisitor solving crimes against God and King. The game is a little tough from the begining since you don't have many good items or money, but that can be quickly solved. The game has many maps with a nice number of dungeons crawling with enemies waiting to be hacked to pieces. The story of the game is long, exciting, full of twists and turns and can really suck you in. The quests may be a little hard since you practically have to do everything from scratch (You start from zero just like a real detective investigator) but when you solve them they give you all the more pleasure for doing so. The combat system is simple to understand, hard to master and unfortunally a little buggy and unbalanced but that shouldn't be a problem. I would recommend this game to every true RPG player. In short: + Storyline + World + Variety of texts, weapons, armor &amp; spells - Combat system - Difficult quests (but this is the charm of the game, should be under +)
2530	Drink all the potions, run away to slowly making it to the edge of the map where you can fast travel (seriously, leaving a dungeon midraid is such a pain in the â¥â¥â¥), so you can buy more potions while unloading all the useless crap you picked up, so you can go back into the dungeon to drink more potions while braving hordes of orcs. Oh, and don't forget to repair your equipment. Just one more tedious aspect of this game. The whole inquisition/investigation thing is interesting, but the automap and quest log aren't very clear about where things are. This makes for a lot of aimless wandering, looking to see if you missed an NPC. I also recommend knowing how to pick locks, because bashing open a chest or a door takes forever: your character frequently misses (it's a door, how can you miss it?) and does little damage. Also, once you turn down a quest you can't take it back up again. So if you're a roleplayer, and you turned down a quest because you didn't think your character would care that some dude's wife is missing, you won't be able to start investigating her once it appears the missing woman is actually at the center of a sinister conspiracy. If you liked Diablo, you may enjoy this game. But it's not that great.
2531	This game is a dark deeply made game that is spooky and hard, nice old school feel to everything. but this game is bugged and you cant change yhour key bindings if this thing was stable it would be incredlible.   truly a shame for such a wonderful piece of art, but it does play stable for some. please dont let me deter you from buying this game.  to the developpers TAKE A MOMENT AND FIX THIS GAME IS INCREDIBLE, YOU WILL BE DOING THE WORLD OF RPG A FAVOR !
2532	Wow, I just finished this game after almost 200 hours of gameplay, (197 to be exact). The game does not necessarily take that long to complete but I really enjoyed it and wanted to explore every dungeon, kill every enemy, read every detail of the story and lore of the world, and complete every side quest. Honestly, it could probably be completed in 140 to 150 hours. This very involved, isometric, action RPG offers a lot for your money and has a very engaging story. It takes place in a fictitious continent strongly modeled after medieval Europe, with a theological system loosely based on Roman Catholicism. The name of Jesus is changed to âThe First Prophet,â but there are crosses and crucifixes decorated throughout the game.   Without giving away any of the story, you are a paladin, priest, or thief, (your choice) who is asked by emissaries of the Holy Mother Church to investigate a gruesome murder in the northern territory of Hillbrant. From that starting point, you are drawn deeper into a dark, heretical plot that goes all the way to the capital itself. An evil centuries old plot is underway that involves black masses and demon resurrections. Heretics are planning to summon Satanâs four chief demons into the world who in turn plan to reek chaos as well as having other intentions that I wonât give away. The story, while quite graphic at times, dealing with such issues as â¥â¥â¥â¥, necrophilia, Satan worship, torture, ect., is incredibly engaging and gradually unfolds and reveals itself to the player over the course of three acts, spanning three areas of the continent. Each of the three acts is nicely balanced between combat and story.   In the story part of the game, you act as an inquisitor for the Holy Mother Church and you need to talk to everyone in order to gather clues so you can determine who the heretics are. Once you gather enough evidence, you can extract confession by means of torture and then burn them at the stake. The combat system is, in my opinion, the weakest part of this game. It is quite clunky and initially, (until your character builds some dexterity) will result in the majority of your strikes missing. It takes getting used to as it is not as fluid as other action RPGs. But once you get the hang of it and you build your character, it is just fine. Fortunately, one thing you will not have to do in this game is grind for experience points and gold to build your character. Each of the three acts is divided into various areas that you must explore and clear of enemies. Once the enemies are cleared, you do not have to wait for them to respawn and repeat killing the same enemies over and over again for experience, (only a very small percentage of enemies respawn anyway). Clearing each area once will provide more than enough experience to build your character sufficiently to progress through the game. But keep in mind, this game is HARD. The battles are not easy at all, especially the ghosts and specters that are introduced to you in act II, (which require magic to beat â since I was a paladin and weak at magic, I had to use flame sword and seals) and the werewolves introduced in act III. You will find that fighting monsters in groups is a bad idea and most of the time you will have to resort to hit and run tactics where you slowly walk up to a group of enemies, lure one or two away from the group at a time, and kill them individually. If you are anything like me, you will be using that tactics for most of the game. Also, even though this world is strongly modeled after medieval Europe, they also mix traditional rpg monsters and mythology in the mix such as orcs, trolls, ect., explaining them as hellspawns, remnants of a dark and foreboding pagan world long since conquered by the true faith, or monsters summoned in black masses, ect. Of course, there are also plenty of demons from Judeo-Christian and gnostic literature as well. It makes for an interesting mix.   I found the magic system in the game to be impressive, not so much because it was terribly complex, but for the fact that a world modeled after medieval Europe, where magic would be considered heretical, would have a magic system at all. On top of that, there are in fact SEVEN schools of magic in the game, each one consisting of spells that are each given their own history and background, (as are all the items in the game!) If you choose to play the game by the rules as I did and be obedient to the Holy Mother Church, then there are four approved and sanctioned schools of magic that could better be described as feats of faith and divine intervention. There is magic of faith, magic of miracles, divine magic, and inquisitional magic. If however you choose to dabble in heresy, (at risk to your own soul), then you can also learn pagan, heretical, or the ever dreaded Luciferian magic. Playing as a paladin, I didnât get to use too much of the later levels of magic, but what I used was quite effective in the gameplay.  So my assessment of this game is that it was very engaging, very involving, very well written with a fantastic story, and quite lengthy. Be prepared to invest some time into it. The mechanics of the game were quite rough around the edges and takes some getting used to. You will get stuck often, and when you do, the GOG and Steam forums will prove to be a God send. One thing that this game requires a lot of, (throughout the entire game but especially around the beginning) is that you carry LOTS AND LOTS of health, stamina, and (if youâre a priest) mana potions with you at all times. You will find that dungeon exploring consists of you getting as far into the dungeon as you can until you run out of potions, (which you will burn through quite quickly), making your way back to the surface, buying more potions, and progressing further into the dungeon. Get use to that cycle. Also, there are a few bugs in the game that have yet to be polished out, all of which you can find solutions for on the GOG and Steam forums. One bug in particular that effected some players, (including myself) involved a crucial NPC named Tinthan who is necessary to complete the main quest, not always showing up where he should be in act II, thus not allowing you to progress in the game. If that happens to you, itâs an easy fix that can be resolved by typing the following console command:  - Press ~ (next to 1) - Type \addbeing_afriend Tinthan -1 -1 - Press âenterâ - You can also find the solution here:  http://www.gog.com/forum/inquisitor/where_is_thintan/?search=Tinthan   This game has tons of atmosphere, lots of charm, and gives you many unique options and story driven tasks. Its soundtrack adds to the atmosphere very well and comes with the game. It sets the mood well and I even put it on my iPod. Throughout the course of the game, you will fight for or against Satan, defeat corrupt priests who sold their souls, perform exorcisms, summon the dead, summon genies, (save them for bosses â trust me), torture heretics, explore a continent, read a novel, and of course, (my personal favorite) rescue damsels. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did and have fun.
2533	I do not usually play isometric RPGs, or in this case, aRPGs. I have tried to get into Diablo and Diablo 2 back when they just came out, but it was something about the game relying on loot more than storyline that gave me the wrong feeling about it.  Now, this game is similar to Diablo, I agree, but that is only at the first glance. As you look deeper, it actualy is very true to the roots of proper Medieval RPGs. The atmosphere is grimdark enough to be comparable to S.T.A.L.K.E.R. or Fallout 1. The world is very hostile, and you will get your a.s.s. handed to you on hourly basis.  The art and overall design is done with great detail. The developers have lovingly and beautifully drawn every little bit of scenery, monster part and menu art so graphics-wise the game is quite pleasant despite being two dimensional.  The quests have good depth in terms of narrative and plot twists and there is no right or wrong ending for majority of your investigations (main quests are very non-linear in this aspect, it is quite similar to L.A. Noire - you never feel 100% sure about your decisions). You can easily accuse the wrong person of heresy or behave in a non-christian way and face the consequences of your actions later in the form of a reward or an enemy ambush.  All in all, I never thought that I would like this sort of old-school aRPG style of games, but this one is done so well, that its atmosphere conveys the roleplaying aspect much better than most FPS shooters with RPG elements. I'd say that you truly feel like the character you are playing.   The only real disadvantage when compared to modern RPGs that I've noticed, besides the obvious aged look, would be that the inventory system isn't designed to be user-friendly. For example, your potions take up sometimes 2/3rds of your inventory space, and that is just for a single trip to one level of the dungeon on lower player character levels. It gets better as your character gets more experienced, but the need to buy a few dozen potions just to safely roam PvE areas never really disappears.
2534	This game in one word : TEDIOUS  First of all, the good points of the game : 3D iso old school RPG, interesting story (at first at least) with some well thought mechanism such as the whole idea of invastigating, torturing and burning evil citizens.  Now, the cons.... the first you see in game is the awkward combat system. Well you basically spam blindly and it works (kinda) - I should add I played this game as a caster. Not enough to make a bad game, right. You want some more ? Ok ! So, let's talk a little more about the combat. You begin as a total weakling : your spells hit no more than on time on 5 or 6 and do ridiculous damage. And then you pass from lvl 6 to 7 (or 8 to 9 don't remember) and you become a divine incarnation who OS every mobs.... at least till the end of the first act (well technically you do continue to OS every mobs in the second but that's for later). The companions you can gather are at first invaluable as you just cannot kill mob alone in the beginning (they can)... and just as you become overpowered they become useless... no, more than useless.... a huge pain the back ! They are so useless you'll soon want them dead (as you cannot ask for a companion to leave).  Oh, I forgot to speak about game breaking bugs, like there's 'rank' depending on stats and skills levels, and item use and ability unlock as you progress... That is... IF the game accepts to acknowledge your progress. Often, even when you do meet requirements you would not have the rank granted. And the only thing to do is wait till you level up to spend another point in the skill and pray this time it will work. You just don't imagine the impact of this bug : basically it means you cannot equip the new items, use new spells or ability you need.  The quest system is awkward too : sometimes you need to do things in the proper order to unlock a dialog, sometimes you need to carry an item, sometimes just find it is enough... And there's never anything to guide you. The resource management is awkward too... you want to cast spell : wait. Regain HP : wait.   Well... all in all I had a pretty good time during the first act : you wander the areas around the town, explore dungeons, cemetery... resolving quests randomly, you delve a little into the story... And then you encounter the end dungeon of the first act. A HUGE pit mine with many many floors... so many you will need to do several round trip to the town to empty your bags and repair your stuff. And of course, to do the round trips you will be required to cross the entire dungeons with each and every floor. You just cannot imagine what it is like. Suffice to say the vast majority of players who where willing to give this game a try (and not discourage by the combat system, pacing and bugs) stop there.  And then the second act. You begin in a big town, I cannot judge the story as I stoped in there but it begins like the first act. No, the tediousness of this game stopped me there ! I thought the game will be less tedious after the big dungeon but no ! It's getting worse ! You will never have any space in your inventory due to potions managaement and the need to keep some very big clue you find for quests (oh but you do not know if it's usefull or not, nor when it will become usefull), and.... I was beginning to die again. Oh my char was still overpowered but I could not kill 2 groups of ennemies (and there's LOT of them) without my armor breaking, forcing me to either continue naked and dying from spiky damages, either do a round trip to town...   All in all the game shine by it atmosphere and some good ideas but that's all. All is tedious in this game : fight, use spells (why is there so few shortcuts ?), use items, carry items, companions management.... Too bad there was something to do here but this game miss the target...
2535	This is a game with very high qualities and very low shortcomings. If the glass is half full or half empty that is for you to decide....but in the end it is still a half full (or half empty) glass that you are served, keep that in mind. The highlight of the game is a very good story very well told, thick convincing atmosphere that stands way above the norm. The gameplay is a mixed bag, thats where the half full/half empty thing comes into play. There are many things that are very rough around the edges like the game areas that are very small and you can just exit them by mistake simply getting too close to the edge. The combat is difficult and requires using a neuron or two thats the good part, the bad part is that its still very rough around the edges, feels like it was made years before the first diablo. Gameplay-wise it feels less polished than similar Sega Genesis games back in the day, but it more than makes up for it with a fantastic story and atmosphere. If story and atmosphere (and a rather high difficulty level) sound appealing to you then go for it, its well worth the money even at full price. If polish and fancy are your cup of tea then stay away even on discount.
2536	It is exactly what it says in the game's description. It's brutal and unforgiving, and will genuinely challenge you. It has a great sense of immersion and depth. The combat is awesome, as you need to be focused to survive. Oldschool graphics - but you can't help but love the game for it.  I would definitaly recommend this, especially for the price tag!
2537	As stated earlier, potion drinking simulator. This game has a really bad combat system, companions are useless and are only used as meat shields.   9/10 writing - very well written 9/10 plot - very easy to like, a lot of twists and secrets 9/10 atmosphere - feels dark, bloody, demonic as intended 3/10 combat system - potion drinking simulator, really not what you're going to look for in this game 6/10 sound is satisfying - nothing out of the ordinary 
2538	It is a serious, demanding and unforgiving game with a unique setting and a dark atmosphere.  Tedious, frustrating and almost unbearable at the beginning, but enjoyable, rewarding and immersive from the middle to the end.
2539	A story driven isometric rpg, if you dont like to read a lot you probably wont like it.
2540	INQUISITOR! Yell it out in a funny accent that nobody in the living world actually possesses, and you will feel good about yourself. Do it over and over, because this game is really â¥â¥â¥â¥ing good. It is extremely well written, something that makes you not give the smallest nugget that the excellent story is making up for the lower-grade graphics. INQUISITOR! (roll the R, roll the R) has the most refreshingly original subject matter I've seen EXECUTED PROPERLY in a game for a long time, and the actually mechanics of how you choose to solve the cases and mysteries you encounter are so far from anything else I've seen in what is essentially, a classic-style isometric RPG, that INQUISITOR! stands in a league of it's own to me. 'Why haven't you played 300hrs of it then?', I hear you ask. Well, it's because... IT'S REALLY â¥â¥â¥â¥ING HARD. My first playthrough I decided that I would try something a little different from what I usually do, and knowing that 'mages' are always the hardest class to keep alive, I set it to easy and picked the monk. Wrong choice. I died so many times I lost count and found myself quick saving every time I killed ONE of the plethora of monsters out in the wide world. The only reason I persisted was that the story was just THAT good. I played along long enough that the little deamon that lives in the back of my brain kept saying, 'If you're the good guy and you're torturing people for confessions, imagine how much fun it's going to be siding with the devil!' And so that is what I did. And it was glorious. And made me feel a little bad sometimes. But I got over it. If you like a challenge and you're looking for something really FRESH in the world of RPG's, buy INQUISITOR! You won't regret it.   OOOOOOO! There's a 'No' option for recommendations now! Time to review Sanctum of Slime...
2541	This game is actually really good. There is real depth to this game and like the diablo series randomly generated items ranging from potions to rings. It feels like a cross between Arcanum, Baldurs Gate, Diabo while making itself a rich experience of its own. NPCs either like you or dont and you unfluence dialogue by your skills or your choices. If you see this on sale its worth the the regular price, I grabbed this on sale thinking id get an hour but found this experience to actually draw me in over and over.
2542	Requirements to play this game: be masochist. Pros: - good story - 'old school' Cons: - still buggy as hell, getting stuck on the wall for the 1325th time starts to get annoying - heavily favors non-melee characters due everyone and their mom having some on-hit debuff which in most cases you can't dispel (not that it would matter anyway since they just re-apply it) - pots, pots, pots and more pots, either use 3/4 of your bag space for pots or prepare to return to town often, well you're going to hit the town often anyway since your bags will be full very fast - overpowered casters who can floor you faster that you can react - evidences that eat up huge bag space. I understand that stuffing 3 *BEEPspoilersBEEP* in a back bag would be rediculous in real life but in most games, quest items are on their own space  So then, recommended? Well being some sorta masochist, I finished the game just because I don't like to give up. I know some will like this game, I did here and there, but if you lack greater patience, don't bother. With no patience, you will end up whacking your keyboard to pieces and smacking your fist through the monitor. That being said, it's 0.89â¬ right now when I type this, so trying the game costs you next to nothing.
2543	This game supposedly took 10 years to make and it shows, firstly by how dated the graphics are. If you can't stand older graphics then stop right here and find another game. Another way it shows the 10 years, though, is by how much sheer content the game has in it. The dialogue in this game is almost exhaustive. So much to learn from almost every NPC in every town, all of it well written I should add. The combat is what you're expecting, simple, not too complicated. The music is great and thematic whilst the sound effects are mostly okay but can be offputting (women moan when you speak to them.) Overall I recommend this game to people who enjoy reading and being immersed in a game's world. This truly feels like a living world and if you decide to embark on this journey, make sure you have a lot of time on your hands and a willingness to take things slow.  TL;DR Version:  Graphics - 3/10  Gameplay - 8/10  Audio - 4/10  Replayability - 7/10  Story - 10/10  Polish - 9/10  Overall - 7/10
2544	This game achieves a more completely immersive atmosphere than most of the AAA, high-graphical games in my library. The limited color palette, the music, the sounds, the well-fleshed mythos and characterisations, even the somewhat bizarre UI- they all contribute to an overarching and deeply compelling feeling of doom. The setting is essentially an alternate medieval Europe in which demons and angels and monsters and spirits walk the earth, and the arts of magic and miracle-working are available to those willing to study. I chose the priest class, as I typically do when it's available- but this is no D&amp;D or WoW priest class. The character progression system is largely open. But its workings are esoteric and draconian, and I find it very rewarding to slowly understand and pursue possibilities. I turn and bless my companion before calling forth lesions on the skin of enemy: the process is largely invisible in-game beyond some floating numbers, but the narrative elements pull it together so perfectly that I am absolutely convinced. Yes, combat involves drinking lots of potions. And yes, the game involves a lot of reading. There are occasional minor mistakes in the translations but frankly the writing is far better overall than it is in most American games, and the mysteries and characters are more well-constructed than an any but the best point-and-click murder games, not to mention your typical rpg. This is NOT an action game. It is a brooding, creeping, sturm-und-drang literary roleplaying mystery game. And I highly, highly recommend playing it.
2545	Soon after I found out about this game I was drawn to it, and I got it on Steam and started playing. The story pulled me in. I enjoy the atmosphere,darkness and incredible music. I recommend this game to those who enjoy a challanging and rich story driven rpg. This game isn't for casual gamers and it does have some frustrating bugs that I run into every now and then. I've had a blast with Inquisitor.
2546	Recommended for fans of old CRPGs from Infinity Engine era and beyond. The developers really managed to make a game resembling that golden age and keep it highly playable. Story is slow, but interesting, adding the fact that it mixes true history with fantasy. If you've heard this game has tons of text in it, then you've heard it right: huge amounts of texts and little to no voice acting to give it that extra flavour we got so used to. Nevertheless, and despite the fact that many NPCs say essentially the same things with different words regarding specific topics, you'll want to read it all if you're really involved in it. Combat is your regular d20 and functional, but as all things in this game, visuals incuded, it feels a bit dated. Still, a wonderful nostalgia trip.
2547	Potion drinking simulator. Good writing but once you get into combat area's it's fight, get poisioned, drink potion. Couldn't take it anymore. Usually finish games like this. Hardest CRPG I've played just because of it.
2548	If you've ever typed 'tl;dr' then don't bother buying this game. However, if you're willing to invest some time and attention, this game is worth it.
2549	I bought this game in some bundle before 1 year. I don't install it after i bought it. And i made a big mistake. It's a perfect game with a long story and exciting gameplay.
2550	Good game. Took an orcs scalp and his friend killed me.
2551	One of the best games that I have. If you like real roleplaying, you should buy it.
2552	I got  Boots of Saint Baudolino  for reading through bunch of text! 10/10, Instant classic!  Now the snark is out the way, I'd argue that playing Inquisitor in the year of our Lord 2015 really  is  a surprisingly enjoyfull experience and I'm immersed entirely in the atmosphere and the world.   Yeah, it's... curious to play such a game precisely now. We've got Pillars of Eternity, Divinity - OS and Wasteland 2 that are true heralds of the modern renaissance of the classical text-rich, immersive isometric(-ish) WRPG and still more beautiful games like Tides of Numenara to come, and playing Inquisitor feels extremely similar and evokes the same good pleasure responses like playing any of those games, or reading a great rich fantasy novel.  Sure, graphics show it's age and are nothing to celebrate, but the updated UI and modern resolution support make playing it an enjoyfull enough experience and deep world-building and atmosphere are (so far) top notch and I don't see any truly meaningful differences in playing Inquisitor from reading Wasteland's descriptions, enjoying PoE's diverse dialogue trees, or being delighted by unexpected char perk from making some decision in Divinity.   Yes, I recommend it.  Cause it made me exclaim in tiny sweet delight for obtaining those before mentioned boots and for hearing an interesting story.. erm.. to boot. Cause I leveled up by two levels solely by killing bats around the first hub area. Cause I was then experiencing sweet 'agony' of choice - where should I spend the points - in stealth, or in thieving. Cause I got to be the medieval detective and because of it I got to hear at least 10 different ways of different people saying somebody had his   manhood/â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥/genitals/Willy/unmentionables/...   stuck in his throat. Cause playing it I get the same feeling I get from (subjectively) the best game I've ever played - Fallout 2.
2553	Recommend? Hmmm...  If you get it on sale you may like this for the interesting plot (i.e. you don't really know initially who the heretics are, and how to get the proof against them). Overall, it feels like a badly implemented cross between Icewind Dale and Diablo 1, with less side quests than IWD but more plot depth than D-1. Also, character advancement is pretty rapid, you can easily get over Level 20 or so in ACT 1.  But: - Graphics are VERY outdated for a 2012 game, looks like a much older game that hasn't aged well - UI is pretty clunky (no sort in inventory, etc.) - Limited types of weapons, armor, etc. - Balancing seems off: melee/ranged combat can be far to easy, but as soon as you meet multiple shamans/mages, it can get surprisingly dificult, with your main character becoming confused within the 1st second of combat. Poison works for an ungodly length of time with few counters, etc. - Few 'side' quests - Income is very limited compared to cost of consumables - Many game design decisions are... well... let's call them old-school (no Town Portal spells or similyr)  May still be considered OK for a low budget production. Without the storyline it would not be recommended at all.
2554	Inquisitor is an old-school RPG with a unique setting and gritty style. It was fun to play but its grindy and often needlessly confusing nature spoiled the immersion for me somewhat. I would not recommend this game to someone who wasn't already in love with classics like Baldur's Gate, NWN, etc., as it's a difficult game to get into initially, but if you still enjoy those top-down RPGS and are hungry for something new, Inquisitor may scratch that itch. If RPGs are a hit-or-miss thing for you or if old-school gameplay with all its muddiness is a turn-off, however, this game will probably not be your thing. 6.5/10
2555	I was pleasantly surprised by this game. It has immense, richly developed lore. Every last God-forgotten potion, or minor item, has imaginative description, just like in Baldurs Gate. Dialogues are good and non-lianear, you can side with or against many NPCs, you can choose to befriend them, torch them in a Holy Flame or let them loose. General mood and gameplay are close to Diablo 1, very dark and intriguing. So, my concusion is that this is not some cheap attempt at depth, as it may seem simply because this game is being sold at 80 percent off very often. This is actually a finely crafred RPG, which may appeal to both BG and Diablo camps of gamers.  EDIT: This game is my nomination for first Steam Awards in category Best Unknown Game.
2556	Great game! Tough as Hell. Even as a priest I used more seals than magic... until I hit magister levels, and those high-level spells changed the game. Takes a while to get some good old-fashioned AoE spells. Pagan magic rocks!
2557	Harkens back to the good old days of Arcana: of Magick and Steamworks Obscura. Writing in the game is thoroughly developed and well writen. Very old school DnD-esque; if you like that sort of thing.
2558	Great old-school game. â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s will hate it. Thats all. BUY. IT. NOW.
2559	You stand at the precipice of eternity, the darkness ever encroaching. You must keep the faith, less you be lost to those who bear the mark of the beast, orcs, Murderers, rapists, beastmen, or Daemons who've found their way into our world through the fornification of men with the great enemy.  'Trust no one, not even yourself. It is better to die in vain than to live in abomination.'  Inquisitor is an old school journey through a 13th century world beset by the ruinous powers of Satan, himself. It is your task, to root out this evil wherever you may find it, sparing no tool in your mission to defeat the depravity you will encounter. The breadth of your search will take you from small hamlets to great metropolises, but do not be fooled, evil cloaks itself both in stygian shadow, and obfuscates the less than stalwart gaze with the glow of the light.   May God be with you, nothing less will suffice.
2560	I came in with fairly low expectations, but was pretty impressed. It is a bit of a diablo clone and the graphics might not be the most up to date. However, the graphics never detracted from the game for me and I found the story/writing quite well done.
2561	This game is Called Inquisitor or by the player name: Potion chugging simulator and you also get to torture heretics in dungeons and later burn them in the pyre! The story starts with a mysterious murder of a merchant in a small village called Hildebrant and you lead this investigation under the command of the local Inquisition and church.  
2562	I spent the first 45 minutes killing bats and collecting treasure. I can't wait to begin torturing people.  9/10.
2563	If you love your hardcore old-school RPG's and all the good and bad that goes with em, you will love this game.
2564	an extreemly enjoyable game, i'm only a little way through it and i love it, the story is suberb, the art is great (though ver VERY dated but i dont have a problem with that) its enjoyable, very much, it gives a real sense of achevement when you finish a quest or get some evidence, or burn a heretic, altogether a great game, and the soundtrack is wonderfull, the gamplay is good, and the story is compelling it takes the idea of an RPG back to its roots and does it great justice, in summary get it if you love story and atmosphere, the deluxe edition is just excelent with the books and art books and the soundtrack is angelic, so yeah, its great
2565	Saw this game on STEAM sale, got it for my steam collection played it, finished and reviewing it.   Graphically the game isn't ground breaking and it's nowhere near to any of the modern RPGs that we see nowadays. Combat system is also not very appealing but it does the job but skill system really is interesting and feels somewhat unique. Music/Background score is awesome it does feel eerie when you go to certain locations and changes according to the location and the mood of the scenario. The strongest part is the story. Yes if you wanna buy this game and wanna enjoy it to the fullest then you gotta read a lot. It has so much content to read in this game it can make a novel out of it. Thankfully I don't mind reading and enjoy reading if the content is good and definitely content here is no joke. There are some logical explanations too given but that'll be spoiler if I explain them here. If you wanna play a game that has interesting story and tons of quests to do which are mostly related to the main story arc then this game is for you.  Mind you this game is not casual ARPG fans. You will not get directions, no indicators to complete your quests and combat is painfully difficult at the beginning. But once you understood how things work then it is going to be a rewarding experience and trust me you would ask for more. I recommend this game to only serious ARPG fans , those who can invest some time and play it with patience or else just stay away from it.
2566	The worst parts: grind and not figuring out some of the more obvious things like hidden floor tiles you could easily see, and items you need to destroy in order to advance in quests.  The best parts: lore, the feeling in game, not pampering &amp; spoiling the players like Diablo series, you can actually find yourself spending some time thinking maybe, a lot of stuff to do, not short game if you dont want to rush through and skip lore.  It's not polished like Diablo series and controls are a bit more off, but it's good and easy to get used to even in demanding standards (I just didn't get used to GTA V autoaim nor manual aim for example but this was no problem).  One issue is memory leak, you need to restrart the game every 1-4 hours, but that's kinda good so you wont find yourself zombified IRL lol
2567	Plays like a cross between Planescape torment and Divine Divinity. Not as good as either. Story is quite mature and lots of reading involved, which may or may not be a good thing depending on how you like your games. A lot of time and dedication went into the making of this game, and it is clearly a work of love by the creators. Buy it. 80 out of a 100 in my opinion.
2568	Not polished, but brimming with content. A solid choice for patient players on the lookout for an oldschool, dark, atmospheric RPG! I rcommend it.
2569	A nice RPG to kill time with, it has a beautiful isometric art style to compliment it's mechanics similar to Baldur's Gate.
2570	Diablo Crime Scene Investigators. You basically have to hunt down heretics before they destroy the world. You also learn about Christian mythology.
2571	Overall pretty neat game.   Great story, lots of dialogue. Art is great. A lot of small details. Tons of side quests.  Takes a good time to beat over 90 hours if you do everything possible. Can be difficult of you don't spend your skills wisely etc.   Play as an inquisitor and save the realm from evil.
2572	Interesting Game
2573	Good story, you can actually torture people and burn them on stakes, could definitely use some polishing though, combat is the worst too (hit a monster, gulp a stamina potion, get hit by a monster, gulp a health potion, repeat)
2574	I haven't gotten too far in the game but thus far I am intrigued by the writing and the story; I would suggest reading a guide here on Steam called something like Beginner's Guide to Inquisitor, which provides a brief walkthrough of the very first part of the game and some other helpful information, some of which is not covered anywhere in the game itself or otherwise implied in a conspicuous manner.  The gameplay seems ok, except I wish it was less action-oriented, but that is just a personal preference which I can overlook considering I also enjoy games like Diablo. What I enjoy most about the game is the lore and premise of the story, there is a lot of reading to do, so if you don't like to read you probably shouldn't get the game. What I enjoy most is the part of the game that doesn't involve fighting and the combat. I still don't mind it too much, but I dislike some aspects of the gameplay and the game doesn't help you along enough with certain information about it, along with other aspects of the game, most of which I can disregard.  I am eager to play this game more but personally am not that crazy about the style of combat and gameplay associated with that; my dislike of the combat might be explained by the fact that I haven't gotten very far in the game and it is more punishing at first, but rewarding later. I think it's a special game and deserves significant recognition for its writing and the unique universe the developers created, which I would like to explore more of, not only because of the writing though but also because of the overall atmosphere of the game. The music is great also, and the game doesn't look too bad and is fine at higher resolutions. Inquisitor has that classic RPG thing going, but not just for the sake of it being classic or old, it just works out that way.
2575	great game but i think most of the bad revews are from people who can't play old rpgs but great game story great
2576	I read about a comic books worth of text within the first minute. Then I burned someone.  Game doesn't â¥â¥â¥â¥ around.
2577	Drinking potions simulator :)...really the game needs a serious rebalance; but its very addictive, story and setting are very intriguing, and the gameplay has some nice features like arresting and torturing humans muahaaha
2578	This isn't Diablo. This isn't Diablo II, This isn't Baulder's Gate. This is Inquisitor. One of the best isometric RPG's of its genre. If you don't like reading and RP'ing experiences then go play something else. Its a classic oRPG with elements found in other like games.
2579	An interesting game with dark and light humour, and freedom to choose as you will. Great game for its age.
2580	I haven't gotten too far in the game but thus far I am intrigued by the writing and the story; I would suggest reading a guide here on Steam called something like Beginner's Guide to Inquisitor, which provides a brief walkthrough of the very first part of the game and some other helpful information, some of which is not covered anywhere in the game itself or otherwise implied in a conspicuous manner.

2581	Very old school, very fun. Hits you right in the nostalgia.
2582	I wanted to like it, and the story seemed interesting, but the author has made some terrible gameplay tuning decisions which prevented me from enjoying it.
2583	This fell short of the 'epic' old school rpg it promised to be. The combat and spell system was generic and clunky. Everything seemed a little out of balance from combat to level progression to economy. Visuals were sub par and buggy. Couldn't quite make it through my requiste 10 hours of gameplay.  On an up note, the mood and setting was dark. The writing, though nothing amazing, had a gritty edge to it. The idea that you are and old school detective working for the house of God to uncover satan worshippers held promise, unfortuantly it didn't hold water (tap nor holy).
2584	A really interesting 'old school' Role Playing Game that is not as popular as it could be...as it has a really long and vast storyline filled with detailed texts and swell writing.
2585	Good old school rpg.
2586	One of Best RPG. Hard but with interesting story lane and nice quests and spells.
2587	Inquisitor is a great game! If you loved games like Baldurs Gate or Planescape Torment, you will be deeply satisfied by this game. It's long, it's challenging, it's detailed. The graphics are 2d but very atmospheric, and it got a gloomy organ soundtrack. Go, get it, NOW!
2588	It seems like a really cool game, but would the developers kindly look into the save game bug? I'm sure I'm not the only one plagued by it.
2589	A bit Glitchy but if you like an immersive and original rpg, this is your game. Buy it during a sale. It's a shame about the graphics and sound, but not bad for the price.
2590	I want to like this game. I really do. I thought the concept was intriguing. The twists and turns of the plot so far are fun to navigate.  However, the combat mechanics don't work well. Even when I have the game on easy, and cheat (I'm a few hours in, and made myself level 100), the game kills me within ten minutes in the current dungeon. And, according to the walkthrough I found, it's a dungeon I should be able to get through at this point in the game.  There is a lot of lore for this game. So much so, it sometimes overwhelms me. I just scrolled through what people were saying and only paying attention when a 'quest added/updated' or 'journal entry added' message popped up.
2591	Meh. That's the feeling that Inquisitor leaves me with.
2592	.
2593	Well finding it for 0.89â¬ a few months after buying it for 10â¬ kinda hurts. Still good game if you enjoy the genre tho.
2594	This game looks awesome... If you can bear with the slow walking speed of your character... I feel bad, but I just can't. DAMN TOO SLOW.
2595	The setting and writing are very nice, and the mechanics on screen are interesting, some variation of d&amp;d games like baldurs gate, yet the game fails to deliver badly due to combat mechanics being broken beyond repair. Specifically stamina. All the rest of stuff could be forgiven somehow, but stamina is a deal breaker. You burn stamina like there's no tomorrow, and constitution doesnt help much beyond increasing your initial stamina pool by a bit, which again, burns after the first mob you face. After that you have to wait forever or be hopeful you brought enough dozens of potions, otherwise its a trip back to town. All of this on easy,  I shudder to think how crap the combat would be on on the hardest difficulty, the designer only played the game as a caster.  And that helped by the mobility issues that can be tolerated: Your character acts at a snail pace due to d&amp;d-like rules being applied in real time, it can be tolerated because for movement you can invest on speed, and for other actions it is not THAT bad although an attack speed attribute would have been cool to have.  All in all, once I started fighting less time than going back to town for supplies I decided the game writing was not worth the pain and bugs, and crap. Sad because it looked promising, check the forums, no more fixes to mechanics or bugs, game is dead. Do not play, it's a waste of time.
2596	Brilliant! Done with the soul. True Hardcore CRPG. 10/10 Diabouls. / ÐÑÐ¸Ð»Ð»Ð¸Ð°Ð½Ñ! ÐÑÐ¿Ð¾Ð»Ð½ÐµÐ½Ð¾ Ñ Ð´ÑÑÐ¾Ð¹. ÐÐ°ÑÑÐ¾ÑÑÐ°Ñ Ð¥Ð°ÑÐ´ÐºÐ¾ÑÐ½Ð°Ñ ÐÐ¾Ð¼Ð¿ÑÑÑÐµÑÐ½Ð°Ñ Ð Ð¾Ð»ÐµÐ²Ð°Ñ ÐÐ³ÑÐ°. 10/10 ÐÑÑÐ²Ð¾Ð»ÑÐ½ÐºÐ¾Ð².
2597	They call it hardcore RPG. I've played most of the CRPGs in the last decade, and i can tell you for sure that this game is not hardcore, it's just broken. It takes 2-3 minutes to kill the weakest enemy you can find, because both of you have a 90% miss chance. To recover you have to wait for eternity or buy potions which cost awfully a lot. I tried a trainer and maxed all my stats, i am still not able to win a 1 vs 2 fight with a god character. BROKEN.  Besides that, the game has a nice frame, interesting dialogues and quests, truly rpg. But it's all ruined by the combat system. It would be a gem but it's just too painful and frustrating to fight.   Buy it only on sale &lt;0,40$  Story/Quest/Visuals: 8/10 Combat System: 2,5/10
2598	Brutally oldschool
2599	Great idea for an rpg game. Sadly it's poorly made. If you are looking for a rpg in a good, old baldur's gate style you will be disappointed. I can live with poor graphics but when i have to fight mostly with slow movement speed annoying magic system (most spells usually aren't working, if you hit someone once per every 5 tries you can consider yourself lucky). I was hoping for many quest requiring talking but most are rather combat oriented and fighting system isn't good in this game. What can i say more? It's a total failure and waste of money.
2600	The game is good, if you like reading. It is like diablo but with not so great combat(enemies are really OP even in easy). It's worth it if you like Old School RPGs and want to do something with your laptop what is about 6 years old
2601	4.5/5
2602	I don't know. It's hard to rate this game. I didn't play it very much as you can tell so I'd give it a neutral if I could. Now I get they are going for an 'old school' vibe - and I love me some old school games. I love the old Ad&amp;D Gold Box games and eat up iso RPGs, But there is a difference between 'old school' and 'plain old ugly and cheap looking'. Seriously, look at old-school type games like Undertale - low fidelity graphics DO NOT mean that it should look bad - Diablo, Fallout, all of those old school games had charm, lots of effort was put into how they looked and presented the story even with the limited technogy of the time. This attention gave them a unique and appealing appearance which still holds up today.... A game released emulating them in 2015 shouldn't look significantly worse. Saying your game is 'old-school' and 'not about the graphics' is not an excuse to release a game that looks like garbage that you obviously didn't spend much time on or put any effort into the presentation. If you are going to do that then avoid graphics all together. This would have been better as a MUD, to be honest. I might have enjoyed it.  I get that this game isn't about the graphics, but It just looks awful, the UI hurts my eyes, the sprites look like they were made in ten minutes (your character doesn't even have a unique sprite), the 'animations' are so low fidelity that I wonder if they spent any time on them at all.   But the worst sin of all is that the text, which is the games main draw and reading is most of what you will be doing, I found it obnoxiously hard to read and the way it explodes on the screen had me constantly scrolling up to follow the wall-of-text conversations. It's a bad way of doing it. Seriously, hundreds of games have done 'conversation style' text well, it's inexcusable and gets old very fast.  That, I think is what did it for me. I could probably have stomached the rest of it if they had a way of reading text and having conversations with NPCs that didn't give me a headache and make me constantly have to scroll around.  It's just... I don't know.. Maybe the story is awesome - that's great and I would have gotten to it if I could have stomached the awful presenation and design. This is still supposed to be a game, after all. If I feel like the devs didn't care about or put any effort into how they presented their product to me, I can't care about it either.  Anyway I really don't like to not recommend indie games. I feel like they are the engine of the industry and need all the support they can get. Especially games that try to be very different like this one and deal with mature subject matter without flinching...but I just can't recommend this game.
2603	Well I definitely agree with all the reviews that say this is a potion drinking simulator. Any problems? Drink more potions until you win. Combat is somewhat clunky, weapons break very fast, game doesn't really teach you how to play. The story is interesting enough except due to poor colour choices and layout of the dialogue boxes its a pain to separate one part of a convo from a different one. hos game doesn't give me quite the hard on i wanted and there are plenty other isometric rpgs that do the job better than this one unfortunately. I will continue to play and update this should be be warranted but first impressions are important and that is what you get.
2604	Very addicting
2605	Inquisitor is a game that I recommend because: - is a method to banish boredom - is indie &amp; RPG - it has trading cards  Enjoy!
2606	Can't even get this game to start, just puts a big black block on my screen and I end up having to turn off my laptop and turn it back on again to get rid of it. Really wanted to check this game out, but I guess I can't. My laptop is fine, it is something on their end that is not working right. Be careful if you buy this game.
2607	So far for me this is a control + alt + delete simulator, i cant get it to run, every time i open the game it remains black and covers half my screen so i have to ninja the task manager with arrow keys and the delete button because it even manages to block that. 10/10 would play but cant.
2608	I couldn't get into this one. I don't mind reading in games, but I thought the dialog was really rambling. The combat in this game is painfully unfun. This might of worked as an adventure game, or even a novel, but as it stands, this is the worst ARPG I've ever played.
2609	The writing and story is great so far (I am not too far into it just yet.)  The mechanics of controls, journal references, combat, and combat balance, is like stabbing yourself in the eye with a fork.  I am personally torn, I want very much to continue the story, but I can't stand another hour of the mechanics.  If good writing and an interesting story is enough to carry any game for you, then this might be a game worth picking up, especially if you find it on sale for $0.99USD like I did, or in a very cheap bundle deal. At full price, no one should consider touching it, even if you love great stories, it isn't worth $10 USD, buy a book instead.
2610	I have a phrase: It's called 'Diablo Clone'.  Diablo was groundbreaking. It was difficult enough to keep you interested, had good, simple mechanics, and story enough to hold onto you. Sure, Diablo was to grind as Congress is to gridlocked, but story and loot were enough to pull you in and keep you playing. Who WOULDN'T like that?  Well, like any game type, it has good clones and bad ones. Good clone? Path of Exile. Bad clone? Inquisitor.  Gameplay and Story are made to serve each other, insofar as if one fails, so does the other. Bioware titles carried the weight of their stories with solid mechanics. In opposition is Inquisitor. I hear the writing of this story is great, and that it is second to none. However, balance is in desperate need in this game. The story has the makings of a great power-hungry-plot-twisty-not-going-to-be-a-happy-ending vibe to it (much like Diablo), but considering the starting enemies (bats) will kick your â¥â¥â¥ if you are not careful (and that's level 1), you are going to have a long road to hoe, and it's not going to be pleasant or, you know, fun. Diablo and Path of Exile don't throw you into the snake pit, they ease you in. Because unless you have a better strategy than 'Stand, slash, win, health potion, repeat', you're going to lose. A lot.   Maybe I haven't tricked out my character properly with the right stats, or I am currently going about strategy wrong, but when it comes to grind heavy, stat based games like Inquisitor, I shouldn't be trying to find out ways to alter player stats. Difficulty is fine (hell, Dark Souls and Mount &amp; Blade are some of my favorite games), but if done wrong, especially in a grind heavy game like Inquisitor, it's a game killer. Which is a shame, because now I won't experience what I have heard is a great story. 
2611	:)
2612	Plenty of excellent written dialogue but the game is broken. it's not even mediocre. It's awful.   One of your first encounters is a spider. A very common enemy. After defeating my first spider, I noticed my character's health rapidly depleting - OH NO - I check my bags - chug a healing potion....but it's no good. The potion goes right out the hole in my stomach where the spider stung me. 80-90 seconds later I'm *dead* Are you kidding me? I'm dead in the first 3-4 minutes of gameplay? I check the internets for a cure to this spider venom, sure enough there is no cure. You have to learn a spell - but it's a level 2-3 tier spell which you can't get until much later in the game. And every cave you go into, heck even in random forests - you will encounter spiders.   The shops are so ridiculous I burst out laughing after I realized what I was dealing with. I am going to play out a scenario in the game for you:  You walk in to a thrift store and you are looking for a pair of headphones and you ask the shop owner if you have any - 'Sorry we are all out' says the blue-shirted employee. You nod. And then ask him again. He again tells you he does not have headphones. Determined you ask him a third time. He replies 'we have three in stock... But you don't have enough money'. Unsatisfied with his selection you ask him again if he has headphones. He replies he has no headphones at all including the three he just showed you. You ask again, finally he reveals to you that he has a pair of used headphones and they are cheap give you a bonus to your health points if you wear it. You buy it. You ask him again out of curiousity to see if he's holding out on you - this time he has headphones that are not used and are slightly better than the ones you just paid for.  Thats right, every single time you check a shop keepers inventory it changes. You could potentially sit there for hours until you see the scroll, sword, shield, whatever you want appear. You don't have to walk out the door to check, you simply click to speak to speak to him again.   Speaking of headphones, don't wear them while playing this game. Music and sound effects are so bad your brain will explode. The startup screen song sounds like a 5-year-old playing on a keyboard. Afte you start you get to keep listening to it over and over and over again. The bats, zombies, ghosts, spiders make painful squeals and grunts as you hit them. You will always hear them before you see them which is good because if there are spiders you'll be running for your life because if you get poisoned, your as good as dead. The only way you could sanely play this game is if you turned off the audio completely - too bad you need to hear for spiders. Seriously, if your freaked out by spiders this game won't help.  The monsters: 1/10 Where are all the demons? Witches? Why am I fighting orcs, zombies, ghosts, and SPIDERS (hate those things). I played the game for 20 hours, got nearly to the end of the first chapter and was completely unsatisified with the selection of enemies. How about a possessed man attacking me? Maybe imps? Witches? IDK - this is the scariest you can think of? The safest way to fight any mob in this game is to get your quickness skill up and run away while firing your short supply of arrows.   The story: ?/10 If you can't play the game, what difference does the story make. That's like a writer handing you all of the pages of his new book, out of order, and dirty from sitting the the backseat of his Buick Skyhawk. There will be better reviews on the story from people who can play this game.  Your companions: 5/10  You gain followers but if they die, they are dead until you gain a resurrect spell. So make sure you quick save every five seconds. All it takes is a quick spider bite. I only recruited I believe 3 companions in my time playing this game. There are a few more. They have little tiny stories but other than that.   The classes My biggest complaint is with mages. They created specializions that are really hard to remember. And when you buy scrolls to learn spells you have to buy for that specializtion to be used. I remember I bought the one that is suppose to make me posion resistant but then found out, it only does it a small percentage and got posioned by a spider anyways and had to chug 2-3 health potions.  Back to the spider - so if you get stung, you literally have to wait nearly 3-4 minutes for the poison effect to wear off. Which means, automatic death if you get stung, there is no way to avoid not drinking multiple potions. Potions can get expensive so I recommend fleeing to church and let the priests free heal you instead of sucking down expensive potions.   Boss battles and combat strategy 1/10 The trick here is simple. Summon a genie, ask him for protection. He will summon a spirit and it will do all the fighting and kill everything on screen including the boss. No need to get your hands dirty. This is not a joke. You can try to fight but you are so limited in combat options that it comes down to this - brute force and running away while fighting. Everytime. And if you don't have it or the space to run away (and you won't) you will be dead in seconds. I hope you quick saved. Demon Souls isn't even this unforgiving.  I suggest you fight the same 5 random zombies, bats, and spiders till you make enough gold to buy good equipment that gives you an experience boost. Then keep farming till you are at a much higher level. So if you see a spider, you can shoot it dead in a shot or two instead of 6-30 shots.   I can't recommend this game and unless you want to play a bad game for laughs but if you do play, do me a favor and kill a spider for me.  
2613	Boring combat ruined the game. I'm curious about the story, but can't bring myself to play this game more than 20 minutes.
2614	Any game that cant figure out how to handle something as basic as mouse control, can never get recommended.  If you have a special mouse like a Logitech 700, you cant play this game, the mouse will lag so bad, youll give up before you are past the chracter creation screen.
2615	crappy game, if you want this type of rpg buy divine divinity or beyond divinity instead alot better. this was slow and with more or less no directions at all
2616	I got this game from a friend and he got it from some magazine i think. If i strart the game, it crashes and i founf no fix!
2617	This game looks fun to play but i cannot recommend it for it somehow combines MOUSE ACCELERATION with menu buttons that are the size of approximately 3 pixels.
2618	it looks like it has a good stoy but it is also a very boring walking simulator so i cant recomend it
2619	The game was fine when I started but the constant need to drink potions, go back to buy more potions made me give up. This is like a potion drink simulator.
2620	I tried Inquisitor for a while and it is not just my cup of coffee, too much reading, too complicated and hard, also it took me a few hours until I was able to start the game on Win10, well if you really love oldschool rpgs, this might interest you.
2621	i wish it were good.  released years ago and still so many basic problems im sorry that i ever paid money for it.  have to play in 800x600 or else the UI is so small you cant see anything or click on anything.  but when you set it to 800x600 it doesnt scale things properly so most of your spell/item slots are pushed off the screen along with the inventory/game menu buttons etc.  supposedly was in development for ten years. if thats actually true i feel sorry for the devs who have spent so much of their time creating something so infantile and pathetic. seems more like it was in development for ten days.  ive been playing crpgs since eye of the beholder on the snes so im not totally clueless to these issues. 3 classes, cant choose skills or weapon proficiencies for any of them. leveling consists of upgrading 1 of 10 or so skills you can never change. plot/storyline full of holes and unexplained things. dice rolls are â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up and weird whereby bats are killing the guards of cities. your character feels pre-made essentially. the game dictates to you how you should play it and you are not allowed to deviate from this set path. the six types of magic have absolutely no distinction between them: 'Divine Magic', 'Magic of True Faith', 'Magic of Miracles', 'Inquisitorial Magic', 'Heretical Magic', 'Pagan Magic'. it doesnt really seem to matter which ones you choose, you can do it with your eyes closed or while looking the either direction, because the descriptions of what they do are almost identical. just depends if you want to be 'evil' or 'good', something that is determined by a mass effect style slider in the center of the character menu. you are at the very least allowed to set your attributes although this has a very blunted effect on the actual game. a char with 5 strength and a char with 20 strength dont have that much difference in unarmed.  â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game.
2622	Terrible game, there's a reason they don't make games like this anymore.
2623	More text than war and peace. Silly old swing timer based combat.
2624	The dialogue reads like it was written by an 11 year old boy, one of the first conversations describes someone as a 'weirdo' and the town as 'â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥'  If you're writing an rpg game, your writing needs to be better.  The ui and mechanics are poor and the engine makes combat more difficult than it need be.  Theres no tutorial, not even a text prompt to tell you how to add spells, or use potions, see item stats etc, these are all forgiveable once you know but this game isnt polished.  Id give this one a miss if i were you.
2625	It says it's an indie game made in 2012. Yea 2012 B.C. maybe. I say that because I am extremely confident that a better game could be drawn on a cave wall. Got this in a bundle with some much better games included. This is complete garbage. Like an incredibly bad ripoff of Diablo 1. I understand they were probably going for an oldschool look and feel, but this is just horrible. The worst graphics I have ever seen, almost no real combat animations to speak of, no health or mana regen lol, horrible and bland and god awful in every possible way. It doesn't even deserve to be held in the same regard as some of the worst games of all time because it doesn't even qualify as a game.  -100/10. Yes you read that right, negative one hundred out of ten. Maybe if they work on this for a couple more years and release an actual finished product then okay, there you go, a real game. Rather than a day one combination of the worst brainstorms from a team meeting that took place in the span of fifteen seconds then was programmed in the span of fifteen minutes while they were blindfolded punching in commands with their keyboards turned upside down and the lights turned off.
2626	Awesome story, terrible, broken combat/spell casting.
2627	Bugged beyond all belief, completely counter-intuitive to play, but fun when it works.
2628	.
2629	TL:DR; game is TRASH. Im playing computer games since 1994. I'v played lots but loots of old school rpgs and this one is totally crap. First of all i have to say i dont want every isometric rpgs to be similar like ultima series or diablo 1-2 or baldur's gate, which are the decent games i love for whole of my life; but guys Inquisitor is a waste of time, atmosphere is okay but thats only significant pros that you can find about the game. So here is my opinion, do not buy this if you dont wanna feel like a potion addicted junky and just be sure about you can play way more better old school rpg's than that.  SCORE; a point for dark atmosphere, another point for inquisitor made me to miss diablo 2 again and the last point for its easy to forget how mad you're about buying a game like this because its cheap. 3/10
2630	I don't know what I expected. This game is a little to confusing for me. But hey, I bought it for $0.99 so... There is most likely somethong cool in this game but its hard to understand. 4/10
2631	OK first of all it has a greate storyline and I LOVE the design (old-school rpg) . BUT I has more bugs than it's story can cover. You meet the first one when yo try to create your character and the game just blacks out ... no error no nothing. Then you spend half an hour searching through the list of posible isues. Then you have to go through all the comments to find the file where they keep the settings to manually put it in windowed mode. I find this inapropriate for a game you have to pay for and this is the reason I do not recomend it.
2632	One of the more underwhelming games I've played. Very disappointed. It reminded me of the classic Diablo games, and as it turned out, was a cheap knock off of them lacking any charm whatsoever. The dialogue is jarring and stilted, there isn't any drive or motivation to do anything, the quests are quite bland (With the first one being to kill a certain number of bats) and the mechanics aren't properly explained. I was stuck in my inventory for a while, pondering over how to find out the stats of the items I had and what they did. Since I've played, I forgot how to do so, and there isn't any in game hints or even a manual that tells you how to do so. Overall, not a great game. If you're looking to get your Diablo fix, go play Diablo. Diablo II is a far better game than this coat-tail riding copy.
2633	This is a bad game. Do not buy it.  The main selling point of this game is that it has lots of text to read in it. This is no bad thing. Unfortunately, despite taking three years to translate it, the translation is laughably bad. The English is full of mistakes and awkwardly unidiomatic to the point where it is painful to read. Here are some examples:  'Don't lose your faith- we have hope till we breathe!' 'I can only say one thing to that matter'  'I'll say you goodbye in that case' 'Is there any problem in it?!' 'I can't talk to you righ [sic] now'  'people, don't wait for anything and light the stakes for witches and sorcerors' 'a man who has destroyed good many hell spawns' 'one should keep good mood and strong faith' 'before anyone could react they ransacked entire mining village'  'so much dark side power was released that it would have dismembered me to pieces'  Another selling point is that the game doesn't hand-hold the player with quest markers and so on. I can appreciate the sentiment but it just makes playing the game tedious. An example of this is when killing bats outside the town at the very start. You keep having to go back and talk to the guard to find out if you have killed them all yet.  The combat in the game might seem diablo-like from screenshots but it's not that fast-paced or interesting. Generally you will be drinking thousands of potions, missing the enemy a lot and walking round incredibly slowly.  Seriously, do not buy this game.
2634	I want my money back, finally gotten time to sit down to this and I was greeted with an over-saturated pixel game of a slow walking tombstone that doesn't even have synced animations. I love a Good RPG, specially an old one and this one looked promising. This is not, the developers really should be ashamed. corners were cut in development, graphically and mechanically. and it gave an underwelming performance that left me chasing bats in a tutorial phase. the story might be good, the mystery and world maybe fleshed out, but whats the point if the main character and combat mechanics are this bad?
2635	Constant CTD after character selection screen.
2636	Tried to play on normal, wow got killed.  Tried to play on easy, got killed again, wtf!  Guess the only thing left is to play it on hard.

2638	I played Inquisitor. It 'very nice graphically to be an RPG dated and also very intuitive and easy to play. But I have found that some key functions do not correspond to actions.
2639	I donât know... Just did not do it for me. I was expecting something like divine divinity and got a big steaming turd pile instead.
2640	It's Diablo with creepy religion. Diablo one actually runs smoother and this game has way too much â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ dialogue that gets boring after about an hour.
2641	Good luck finding that last bat.  Spent a full half hour just trying to get into town, but no. There's BATS out there. Or I should say, at least one... somewhere. Canvassed the whole map as best I could, killed maybe a dozen bats. Not good enough for Mr. gate guard. Screw this, I'm done.
2642	What a s***y game... bad graphics and akward controls. Oh... and you can't change the keyboardsettings!
2643	Game seemed alright at first despite obvious crappy graphics, annoying amount of reading required, weak storyline and lack of tutorial / control introduction. But despite this i still tried it, i circled a camp killing bats trying to stay close to the camp so the quick travel map wouldnt keep popping up, returned to guard to complete quest and it was ready to be completed, finished talking to the guy and suddenly im transported to a menu screen so i go back into my game and my character no longer accepts any commands except to look at his quest book. I try to complete the quest to enter the city which now apparently does not work and i cant talk to the guard now can i move my character or enter the city. almost 25 minutes into the game and im trapped in a bug on the very first quest. Cant recommend a game that looks and runs this bad to anyone.
2644	Graphics are bad.
2645	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing the worst game ever they had 10 years to take a â¥â¥â¥â¥ i guess beacause this game looks sounds and plays like â¥â¥â¥â¥. i would recommend this game if you love anal and your a dude.
2646	don't kid yourself you want diablo... dont pretend you don't, do not bother with this terrible wannabe clone, just go buy diablo and save yourself the $2 for a refreshing coke while you play the game you actually want to play
2647	 KAMGUSTA's mini Review   80's graphics. Clunky UI. Tons of text to read. But this isn't the worst part: even the first enemies of the game, bats, will leave you without stamina after a couple of swings with your weapon. Be prepared to use thousands of potions. Funny fact: potions are not stackable and won't refill your quick keys automatically. No, you can't rest either. This isn't an hardcore RPG, this is a clunkycore RPG.   Score 4/10 
2648	2 much 2 rid
2649	Terribly outdated. Lots of development time, but feels like a cheap copy of Diablo 1.
2650	.
2651	&gt;Launches game to farm the trading cards &gt;Feelsgood.jpg &gt;Hears high screeching noise from intro &gt;Has ear seizures &gt;Makes trip to doctor &gt;Doctor says I have ear cancer &gt;Has 3 months left to live   Basically don't buy this game unless you're planning on dying soon. If the intro is that painful I don't want to know what the actual game is like......   
2652	Good story, bad combat. Its a love-or-hate game. I personally liked it, but the button mashing was horrible. Buy this only if you don't have a good RPG to play.
2653	This game is in Dire need of a mod
2654	Ostensibly an old-school RPG, but it was too old-school for me (and I played Ultima III when it came out).
2655	AUTOPAUSE AUTOPAUSE PLS! COMBAT IS TOO FAST!
2656	If you ever liked Baldur Gate, DnD things or just want to roleplay in a dark and grim universe in the likes of 'Conan the Barbarian' or 'Berzerk' this is for you.  I really enjoy it.
2657	This is a great game. If you liked Diablo, Baldurs Gate type rpg's then you'll love this. Very well made in-depth game that has that olde' rpg feel.
2658	AUTOPAUSE AUTOPAUSE PLS! COMBAT IS TOO FAST!
2659	It's like an ugly boyfriend who kisses really well.
2660	I had originally played Deadly Premonition on the 360 during May of 2010. I was visiting my grandmother and was out with the family at Best Buy, where an uncle of mine was considering getting a printer. Being the dork I am, I went to go check out the video game section, and there were a few copies of Deadly Premonition lined on the shelves. The cover caught my interest as a horror fan, and the cheap $20 price tag sold me on it to make a blind purchase. When we got back from our day out, I put it into the 360 and started to play.  The first thing I noticed about Deadly Premonition, and something that has remained true, is that I love its soundtrack. A few select tracks are used maybe a little too often, but the music perfectly fits the odd tone of the game, and is pretty damn catchy. Even as I am writing this review, I find myself humming a few of its tunes. This is a case where the soundtrack isn't just good, but is a big part of this game. I am convinced the game may not have been as well received by as many if it didn't have this off-kilter soundtrack that really gets you into the mood for the oddness the game throws at you.  The next thing I and about anyone else will notice is that this game looks dated. It's something of a miracle that a game in this graphical condition was released as a published disk-based console title in this day and age. It looks dated, but then controversially I would say the look fits the game. It sort of sets you into a set of expectations for the sort of game you're about to play. This may be backwards logic, but if the game had looked amazing I feel a lot of people would of found the actuality of the game to be lackluster to its looks. And as the game goes on, the odd facial expressions and clunky animations become very amusing. Notably, the Director's Cut does update the graphics some, but honestly its hardly noticeable.  The rest rolls from there. The controls are a bit awkward, but you adjust. The first chapter isn't all that great, but it gets better. And before you know it, you start getting hooked into the game. I know I did. And it's the type of game you want to talk about.  Heavily inspired by Twin Peaks (to a point in development the game got in legal trouble for far too many similarities that they had to change it, back when the game was known as Rainy Woods), the story follows the same basic premise; An FBI agent goes to investigate the homicide of a local high school beauty in a small pacific-northwestern town, but the town has a darker side the FBI agent discovers as he gets deeper into the case. The town is Greenvale, and our character in Deadly Premonition is Agent Francis York Morgan (but just call him York, that's what everybody calls him), an offbeat FBI agent who solves cases through odd measures, particularly of note in the fact he uses a system he calls profiling (that basically results to magic to figure out what happened by collecting clues), and see's shapes and messages in his morning coffee and newspaper that gives him clues to things to investigate. He also talks regularly to some unseen person named Zach. Many will quickly put together that 'Zach' is actually York's way of talking to the player, who only he seems to realize is watching everything, and who only he interacts with.  Deadly Premonition has unforgettable characters. York stands out, as the player really begins to form a connection with their odd agent, but the rest of the cast are just as good. The likes of Emily, George, Thomas, Mr. Stewart, Polly, and the rest of the colorful cast will last with you long after the game has been completed. And the story legitimately begins to get gripping. Like the rest of the game, Deadly Premonition tells an odd tale, and honestly some of what occurs in the game is absolutely ridiculous, but somehow you'll legitimately care what's going on. That is when you're not laughing your â¥â¥â¥ off, as the game is somehow both intentionally and unintentionally hilarious at the same time.  But it's more than just that, this game manages to actually be touching, and I found myself more emotionally involved with this game's story and characters than most any other game I've played in the last few years. And while I don't want to get ahead of myself, the last few hours of the game's story are unforgettable. Saying bye to York and the rest of Greenvale is up there as one of the hardest things I had to do as a gamer upon coming to the close of the game.  Deadly Premonition is not just, 'so bad it's good' (though definitely parts of the game are just that). The game does some things absolutely wonderfully, really stellar and uniquely. But it does other things terribly, absolutely horribly. It has flaws, a lot of them. But somehow most of these flaws become strangely part of the whole experience. They sort of blend in with everything else and become part of the overall experience of Deadly Premonition. Not everyone will like Deadly Premonition, but the title since I've played it has taken on a fairly big cult following, and for good reason.  Deadly Premonition is more than the sum of its parts. The game has obviously a lot of heart in it, and it shows. But it also is loaded with flaws, and that also shows. But somehow, the heart put into this game and the elements that make it amazing shine above the cumbersome driving, or the glitches the game has, or the fact the game has a few annoying QTEs. The term, 'experience', in games gets thrown around a lot these days, but this truly is what Deadly Premonition is. An experience.   And it's not a short one either. The game should take someone 15-20 hours to complete the first time. To do the side-quests easily adds another 5-20 hours (and you should do the side-quests, they're rather fun and most all of them add additional cutscenes and character depth, plus some of them reward you with handy items, like quick-travel or a weather doll or infinite ammo weapons, or even just new cars and suits).   The PC port has plenty of flaws. There are many fan-made work around's and patches made to help, but these still exist. I was lucky that I didn't run into much, but the game did crash a couple of times for me, and there's this weird thing with the game where the longer you play it without closing it and re-launching it, the slower over time the FPS will get. It's hardly a perfect port, and some will definitely be turned off by this.  But it's also definitely the best version of the game. And if you haven't experienced Deadly Premonition before, you definitely ought to at least give it a try, maybe stick around for the coffee.  Deadly Premonition is not a masterpiece in a traditional sense, and it's too flawed in ways to be named a good game (maybe okay at best). But Deadly Premonition is probably one of the best gaming experiences you could have that's released in the last few years. You'll laugh, you'll cringe, you'll be hit with feels, and you'll panic. When all is said and done, we need more games like Deadly Premonition. It's the mid-tier game in one of the purest forms, flawed and arguably bad, but with so much heart and enjoyable elements you may not care, and hardly any game will put a smile on your face as much as DP does.
2661	Deadly Premonition is like the old cadillac you found in your grandpa's barn after he passed away.   Getting it to work will give you all sorts of headaches, and more often than not, you just want to lock the barn and forget all about the damn thing. But if you actually manage to put up with all the crap it throws at you and manage to make it work, you're rewarded with a ride that's both, unique and unforgettable.   Easily one of the best and worst games I've ever played.

2663	 Deadly Premonition - Poor PC Porting Perfection
2664	Basically Twin Peaks but made into a game  Pros -So many side missions -Soundtrack (actually pretty good) -Subtitles (Big and Easy to read) -Reminds me of Resident Evil 4 (Probably the Graphics, Specific save points, over the shoulder gameplay and the BIG Subtitles) -York is so quirky -Characters are all so unique in some way (E.g. Gay Assistant, Thomas) -Humor -Quite lengthy  Cons -Its a port -Minor Hiccups -Driving sections  Overall, some might say that this game is bad because of its outdated PS2 graphics and other it being a port and all but honestly, those people don't see the the good points, what good points you may ask? The over-the-top humor, a range of memorable characters &amp; Nostalgic gameplay (RE4). I would say this game is worth a buy but you'll probably only during a sale since the game is kinda old and at $25 you can get other better games and besides its like $2.49 during a sale.  Score: Get during Sale Final Verdict: 8/10
2665	'It's like skyrim with zach' - IGN
2666	Oh Deadly Premonition, how you look so fun But alas on our computers, you just will not run. From your unfortunate PC port to your silly resolution Near impossible to fix, leaving us in confusion. Crashing to desktop grows difficult to bear And at your price, it just feels so unfair! Lastly, for some, you won't run as a whole Crying 'Oh please, just work! This is worse than Dark Souls!' Oh, Deadly Premonition, end our dismay We'd just like to enjoy you, so please let us play!  So says Mr. Stewart.
2667	This is a really tough game to review.  Imagine a really bad restaurant. It has terrible service, terrible decor, smells bad, looks bad and is just generally unpleasant. It shows no promise at all. And yet....  ...They serve about the best main course money can buy.  Deadly Premonition's main dish is it's completely captivating story, which is brought to life by some excellent voice acting. The main characters are a really well written bunch and I found them quirky, utterly charming, charismatic and lovable. I wanted to know everything about them.  If you have seen Twin Peaks, you will not fail to notice this game has derived A LOT of inspiration from that show. Luckily it does so in a really cool and often suprising way and so it never feels like a bland ripoff. Beyond the Twin Peaks influence, it's pretty obvious the game designer, Swery, likes David Lynch's wider canon of work too, to the point that the game could be mistaken as a collaboration. Being a Lynch fan, that's not a bad thing in my book; I think other Lynch fans will love this too.   So what's not so good? I'm afraid there are quite a lot of niggles that takes the shine off the Deadly Premonition experience.  Here we go:   - My experience was massively hurt by technical problems. The game crashed constantly unless put into ME/98 compatibility+admin mode. Alas, this had the side of effect of gradually bringing frame rates down from 60fps to 10fps within 15 minutes of continued play. Repeated reboots were required to maintain a playable frame rate.  - in compatibility mode, a slew of minor bugs arose, such as gun-aiming glitches, which made the game annoying. - A unofficial hack (called DPfix) to unlock the 60fps is required. - Pretty poor graphics with a washed out palette, rough textures, and some very ropey 3D models at times. - Driving is really tedious. It takes too long to get anywhere. - The core 3rd person survival horror game is not very enjoyable.  - The RPG mechanics (health, hunger, tiredness, inventory management) are completely superflous - Time lapse mechanic is frustrating. You have to wait around for certain events to happen. Time can be sped up, but the mechanic means that you can end up passing TOO much time and missing your appointment.  - The game is littered with tedious mandatory mini-games, such as waggling the thumbstick to run away from danger, or hiding from an enemy to escape danger.  - boss battles are a chore - not scary in the slightest. (even the bits I think were meant to be scary) - Dull fetch side quests. - The game is not challenging in the slightest. - Production values are not great. Very rough around the edges. Wonky transitions between scenes and parts of the musical score.  - Story got so ridiculous it was immersion-breaking. (A mad story isn't necessarily a problem, but there needs to be some sort of underlying internal logic to make the suprises and twists truly matter)  - no steamcloud  In short, the core game is just not very good. I played this to enjoy the story and get to know the town and townsfolk of Greensvale, not for the sake of the game.   That's enough criticism. I don't want to put anyone off from giving this a go, because DAMN, the story and characters and atmosphere are SO SO good....Good enough that I can forgive that massive list of faults.  But would I recommend it to you?  Now, that is a tough question. I have to give a somewhat nuanced answer here. I'd have to ask:  - How tolerant are you of bad ports? This is one of the worst I have experienced. - Do you like brilliant stories so much you can put up with a subpar game which is very rough around the edges?  - Do you appreciate great voice acting, atmosphere, superb characters, and perhaps David Lynch's work too?   If you are pretty tolerant, likes stories, love Lynch and can put up with a game that is a quite poorly designed, go for it. You won't regret it.   If you veer the other way....stay WELL clear.   I few things to add: the game is supported by a deliciously quirky soundtrack, and features one of the most charismatic protaganists I have yet encountered in a video game: Francis York Morgan (who is up their with Garrus from Mass Effect for me)   I LOVE this game, despite its numerous faults, and I can't think of a game so in need of a modern remaster that polishes the rough edges, gives it a nice, glossy coat of paint, and improves the core game so it can be experienced by a wider audience.   It's not a whole hearted recommedation, but if you can stomach it's faults you are in for an unforgettable experience.
2668	A game that understands the player, and uses its entire design to promote both its understanding of player experience and atmosphere. Contests with The Stanley Parable in making player choice contextualized in a way that matters and acknowledges the player's motivation without compromising it, unlike many Triple-A titles that garner more praise. A truly amazing game, and one worth playing at any cost. If more games were like Deadly Premonition, the world would be a better place.   Unlike almost any game before it (with the exceptions of The Stanley Parable and Demon's Souls), Deadly Premonition understands the unique and powerful triad of Player, Character, and Narrator. At no point in the game is any of these functions invalidated.  Many users comment on how 'weird' the game is, or how the graphics are outdated or the controls clunky, and this is important. The game's major aesthetic is that exact cognitive function: It means to play like a PS2 game, look like a PS2 game, and even ape PS2 games. Secretly, though It does all of these things the best way possible: By actually constructing and improving upon the foundation it attempts to make fun of. Deadly Premonition is the unique and rare game that actually constructs on, as opposed to strictly deconstructs, what came before. You may hate the controls, and you may think the graphics are outdated, but if any of these things were changed its own aesthetic would clash with itself. These choices were deliberate, intelligent mirrors for the game's internal design and direction.  Deadly Premonition is surprisingly one of the most intelligent games I've ever played. No matter how strange, unexpected, or uncomfortable it might be it is a game that understands what games can do. It fully utilizes the medium, and for that, it deserves a perfect score.  10/10
2669	This is the quintessential 'so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing bad it's good' game. Nothing else comes close. By the end you'll be questioning your sanity, asking god to smite you down, and screaming 'WHY SWERY? WHY?'  'Very underrated.' - York
2670	When people decide to make a game on a really low budget, but are aware of it and stick with it in their entire game design, then you could either say, it's a bad game with a really low budget, or a masterpiece in its own right. Personally, I say the latter.  This is probably the worst low budget japanese style open world silent hill like mystery detective horror killer story survival game ever developed, but it is the only low budget japanese style open world silent hill like mystery detective horror killer story survival game ever developed, which makes it the very best game of it's entire category of all time.  And I mean that absolutely seriously. This is the worst game I had the greatest fun with in a long while. I had more fun with Deadly Premonition than with many triple A titles. It is awkward, it is really painfully badly executed, but even after I saw the ever appearing 'flicking the lighter to light a cigarette' animation during a cutscene for the 200th time, I still thought it was hilarious.  Deadly premonition is the prime example that a bad game doesn't necessitate a game to be less fun. That and the fact that the story is a ginormous clusterf***.  You'll either love it, or you'll hate it. I loved every single second.
2671	On a technical standpoint this game is one of the worst ports of all time.   You will need a lot of patience to get the game running and to actually play it. Through the steam discussion thread that the dev posted I managed to get the game as stable as it could ever be. It would still occasionally crash after long sessions but it could be solved by saving often and restarting the game every now and then.  If you cant be bothered fixing the game, buy it on the console or watch a playthrough on youtube. Skipping this game entirely would be a real shame since it has a cast of interesting and weird characters with some cheesy B-movie moments.   One of the best scenes is the opening scene that shows agent Morgan smoking, on the phone talking about tom and jerry's S&amp;M relationship, reviewing the evidence on his laptop and even holding a bag of evidence in front of his face all while driving through a curvy forest road on a rainy night.  The absurdity of that moment was one of the things that hooked me.  Without going too much into the story, you play a FBI agent investigating a murder case in a small town. This is the best part of the game since you get to interrogate the weird and interesting townsfolk and the identity of the killer is something that will keep you guessing throughout the game.  The gameplay is nothing special, car controls are bad and so is the map but by the middle of the game I found myself knowing the full town layout.  Shooting has been improved for the director's cut giving the gun infinite ammo and having a button that centers on the enemy. Yeah it removes some of the horror survival aspect of the game but makes the game way easier and less frustrating since shooting was a weaker part of the game.  You will need to manage a hunger meter and keep your clothes clean, its pretty trivial and would only become a pain when you try to skip to to do side quests.  In conclusion and a TL:DR for some people: This game is a gem, very raw and unpolished and I hope you wont skip it just because of the bad reviews.
2672	 For a normal person, a causal player:
2673	  How I Made Deadly Premonition Work With Windows 10
2674	although the port isn't the best, it's still worth it for the rest  so says mr stewart
2675	Got it when it was dirt cheap, and I do nÃ³t regret it. The whole story kind of has a twin peaks crazy vibe. That's what makes it so wonderful. Somehow it's a bit of a mix of fighting off zombies and investigating. It's really a great game, if you can ignore the awfully terrible port and the bugs.   Would've been worth the full price if it worked a lot better.  Right now it's kind of bad, no proper resolutions, sound is all over the place, and had to use compatability mode to prevent the game from crashing at startup. So there's a risk you might not get the game to work properly. There are a few mods and fixes around on the net tho.
2676	One of the best stories ever to grace a video game. The game has a few technical issues, and the graphics leave alot to be desired but if you manage to get past these issues you'll find a tremendous story, in my opinion one of the best stories to ever grace a video game.  I'll be honest and say the controls are bad, the graphics aren't really up to par with modern games and you'll more than likely encounter a few technical issues getting the game to run.  Ignore those issues (except not getting it to run, try to find the fix for that) and you'll fall in love with the story. Just keep in mind the game starts off slow, and you'll very likely want to quit if you get caught up in doing side quest in chapter 2. Just push forward, trust me, it's worth it.
2677	It's the game Alan Wake wanted to be, but with quirks and wonderful B-movie taste.  But be warned: it's bad, it realy is. It won't be working without fan patches, and it's very rough around the corners, and the story's ludicrous. But it has style. It has a character. It's like an old geeky friend with strange tastes. Not creme de la creme, but interesting one.  Reminds me of an old game named Harvester.
2678	Deadly Premonition is a very polarizing game. Yes, the gameplay can feel like absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥ (the driving controls still kill me even to this day) and the PC port itself is pretty catastrophic (random crashes, ahoy!), but this game has a lot of heart with a pretty thrilling story and interesting characters to boot.  Definitely recommended for those who love the following:  1) coffee 2) Twin Peaks 3) japanese wackiness 4) who just want to play something that offers something unique, despite having a lot of flaws  I don't like open-world games in general and while Deadly Premonition has a lot of OPTIONAL stuff, I recommend you to do some of those to get to know the local population of Greenvale better. You will thank me later.
2679	Want to play a game with quirky, rememberable characters? With a crazy mystery that never seems to stop twisting? How about plots that take a second playthrough to REALLY get? Hours of roaming time? Countless collectables? More Collectables? Did I mention too many Collectables? Is there such a thing as 'too many' collectables? Do you like commentary on 80's horror movies? Do you often have suspicions than NPCs are up to no good, but are often unfonded?  Would you like to reveal the dark secrets of those 'innocent' NPCs through tons of side-quests? Even if it ruins their otherwise perfect marriages and lives? And finally ... Are you willing to put up with the games wonky combat controls to enjoy an otherwise great story and game? Then this, my friends, is the game for you.   
2680	The steam port is absolutely terrible. Crashes frequently and had to change multiple settings on my computer just to get past a certain part.  10/10 this game is amazing, but get it on a different platform.
2681	Do I recommend Deadly Premonition? Absolutely. Do I recommend this version of Deadly Premonition on Steam? Well that's going to need explaining.  Deadly Premonition is, in as few words as possible, Twin Peaks: The Video Game, you play as Francis York Morgan, a quirky FBI Agent is brought out to the town of Greenvale in order to solve the death of a young woman, who York believes was killed by someone who has done similar murders in other towns, all with the same connection of mysterious red seeds, along the way he will meet with and help out the town inhabits in any way he can to bring him one step closer in solving his biggest case so far.  Basically my recommendation of this game comes with an asterisk, you have to be able to enjoy quirky plotlines, weird gameplay, and have a basic love for Twin Peaks or a number of other David Lynch like things, that being said even though the Director's Cut of this game fixes a lot of problems and adds in a few extra bonuses, there are still core issues with the game that must be suffered through in order to enjoy the game's story, for example this game has an open world but with no fast travel unless you do a side mission half way through the game, but before that you have to drive everywhere, and the map system is not the best, add in clunky shooting mechanics and missions thrown in just to add filler and you have gameplay that is not the most exciting thing in the world, not to mention the graphics look like they came out of a Playstation 2 game.  But even with the issues this game has I fully recommend it, the story is interesting, bizarre, and downright insane at times, and will leave you wanting to see what happens next, though you may have to suffer some gameplay to get to the good part... or some bugs.  Which brings me to the second part of this, the PC version of this game has issues, many, many issues, I recommend people to check out guides and the forums to understand some of the fixes, if you have a Playstation 3 I feel that version of the game is the best to get, but if you are unable to and PC is your only option, be ready for random crashes, weird texture bugs, slowdowns, Windows 98 compatibility mode, and many hours fooling around just to get it to work right, if it even works at all, but who knows you might be lucky and the game works perfectly, at any rate know that going in.
2682	Right I just want to say I LOVE this game (trust me I'll need to say that before I get into the parts I don't like). I think the story is amazing. It's a very well-written game with interesting and well developed characters. Yorke is wonderfully entertaining especially when you're just driving around and he's talking to his alter ego Zach about 80s movies. A lot of the mini stories are fun and the action is very tense and can be really scary at times. I'm serious this game can be pretty horrifying. I enjoyed every part that didn't involve...well uh... ok... The controls.  I've read some other reviews and apparently the console versions controls were a lot smoother but the PC controls leave much to be desired. Yorke kinda controls like a tank (which would be fine in a point and click game) but this is a horror shooter so it's a little clunky and awkward. The real time events are uh... a little difficult. Now I'm slightly biased as real time events are the bane of my existence but Deadly Premonitions are something very special indeed. In most games the real time event keeps the same pattern so that you can kinda power through it after several tries. This game changes the pattern EVERY SINGLE TIME. So it's a little difficult. Though I feel someone with good reflexes could get through it no sweat, I'm just slow af.  When you drive you feel like you're driving on black ice though I will admit it's very fun when you drive really, really fast and crash into stuff.  Also if you're playing on PC be aware this game might crash, several times. It did for me a lot. You can have several days without crashing and it could play smoothly until one day it's like NOPE and crashes on you during a scary part, and oh boy you forgot to save so time to go back into the scary tunnel again with those wall crawlers that take a dozen hits with a shotgun again!  And yet... after all this... I still love it. It's like Taco Bell, even though it hurts and might even be morally wrong you just keep coming back for more. I really do think it's the characters, story, atmosphere, Twin Peaks-vibe, challenging puzzles and fun shooting segments that keep me coming back.  I'd recommend it to people who have a lot of patience and want a game primarily for story. Still amazing though.
2683	Deadly Premonition is my favorite game of the entire generation. It's plot, characters and setting are just that engaging every time you come back you still have a great time. The story may sound familiar if you have watched twin peaks in that a girl is murdered in a small town out in the boondocks of america and its up to FBI Special Agent Francis York Morgan to solve the crime (Call him york by the way, everyone does) but as he arrives in the small town of Greenvale things are not what they seem  with strange phenomenon involving red seeds and a legend of a killer in a red raincoat that only appears on rainy nights. The game bursts and ozzs with personality and charm from the music that plays in the opening menu to the way that York interacts with Zach (his special friend) about b-movies. The directors cut that was originally released on PS3 boasts a new scenes that expand the games ending and also tell the story in a different way. The PC version however brings very little to the table by only offering halloween themed suits for York, Emily, The Raincoat Killer and a car skin and even though the game now runs past 30FPS it just doesn't feel right at that speed as it feels to fast... Another issue is that since the directors cut features reworked movement it feels clunky on the pc without a controller while if it used the original versions tank style controls (which I actually liked) then maybe it wouldn't feel so wierd on PC. The last issue that I have that wasn't addressed in the directors cut is the timing of certain music I will give you an example You're examing a dead body and this forboding unerving music is playing then suddenly it changes to light hearted jazz I will admit I got a laugh out of it the first time around and this is the only time I can really remember this happening.  All complaints aside Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut is a game that you have to own Everything about it feels right and it was the game to renew my faith that games can exceed the bar in many aspects without needing multiplayer, graphics with volumetric lighting (otherwise known as WANK) You are a fool to dismiss such a fine game and even more of a fool to insult it One of the generations top games 100000000000/10 
2684	It is like blue cheese - you either like it or avoid it. I absolutly love it, but ironically wouldn't touch blue cheese with a two meter stick.  An unique game with a story inspired by Twin Peaks. I truly recommend for all horror/mystery fans!    My nominee for 'Whoooaaaaaaa, dude!' Award in 2016 Steam Awards ceremony.
2685	 Pros:  - From a non-technical point of view this is a gem of gaming. There're not many open world survival horror games like this out there. - Add to the formula a contrast between awkward humor, a dark story about a murder, and tons of references of movies and series. Yes this stinks Twin Peaks everywhere...and we love it! :D - Let's talk about visuals and gameplay. The game was originally intended to be on PS2 but finally it came for the second one. The characters looks decent in comparison of some meshses from Greenvale. But the amount of work done on each road of this city deserves a bit of understanding. The goal was to achieve the detective experience of solving this murder in a non-linear way. I mean the game has it's scripted path and missions but you can always add to the story by doing side-quests in GTA fashion or LA Noir Fashion. I think Swery did a great work on Greenvale. Each part of the city has some collectibles and some clunky or funny designs that tells the player 'go there!...is funny isn't it!?' for instance when you go through a forbidden road or a field filled with animals. The map can look like game from early 2000's but I found this place a very nice place to explore. Plus the rain that's my weakness...plus the woods. In terms of design and having some TP references he achieved it big time! - The characters look way better. The shadows the cast within their mesh is way better than the projected on environments and it looks like the put some nice attention on normal maps. Of course the animation is cheesy and basic sometimes. But this is part of the style (like D4 for instance a few years after DP). - The combat is like RE4. Not as fast and the enemies could be repetitive BUT the key of its levels is the puzzle solving. Some enemies drop keys. Other levels makes you figure out a path or interact with the elements in it. - OMG the car controls xD (no, is not a 'pro' but is not a 'con').  - The OST is amazing! Point mother â¥â¥â¥â¥ing period! - The Director's Cut adds some tweaks on the controls that makes the experience way better than the Xbox 360 first version. Of course the changed some artistic details like the famous color grading but this is the ultimate experience (at least for now). - Also the Director's Cut version has a few new cutscenes which adds to the story. I will not spoil anything but I found the ending of the game one of the best from the last few years. Not kidding. - If you didn't get many side-quests the game has TONS of interesting details.  - 'DP Fix' exist!  (http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?p=438)  As it happened with Dark Souls Prepare to Die Edition. Deadly Premonition was a even more broken game on PC at launch. Consider helping the modder ;) Now we can play the game and even over-sample shadows, resolution, AA, AO etc.. The fix also let's to change textures, there are some HD Packs and button prompt if you want to use a Dualshock for instance.   Cons:  - Even with a monster PC you'll have some long loading times. I know there will not be a remastered definitive edition on the future. But if there was any chance, this is something that can help improving the experience A LOT. - You can loose some interesting character development if you don't explore Greenvale. Spy people on the windows!!   Notes:  - You can find 'Pillow Stains', the song from the former form of DP called 'Rainny Woods' check the trailer on YouTube:         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Rainy Woods TGS 2007 trailer&nbsp;
2686	Deadly Premonition: The Directorâs Cut is a strange beast. This horror game plays like resident evil or silent hill, but feels like Twin Peaks. The game is absurd, terrible, weird, stunning and basically the closest thing to art video games will ever be. The story involves an FBI detective who talks to himself and is rewarded with cash for each card of medal he collects as well as any headshots he performs. He loves headshots. You talk to people, like these weird kids and you collect items to use on things, like this fuse box. Lollipops and donuts can recover your health.   The game takes on a wider open world feeling later on and between missions you return to this home base of sorts, to get more incomprehensible chunks of plot thrown at you. This game is weird to say the least, but I dig the vibe of it all. You certainly donât know what it will throw out next. Make sure to grab DPfix, from the maker of the Dark Souls resolution fix, it lets you play the game beyond the 720P default.  Watch the video review on youtube in Steam Shots EP125

Not as fast and the enemies could be repetitive BUT the key of its levels is the puzzle solving. Some enemies drop keys. Other levels makes you figure out a path or interact with the elements in it. - OMG the car controls xD (no, is not a 'pro' but is not a 'con').  - The OST is amazing! Point mother â¥â¥â¥â¥ing period! - The Director's Cut adds some tweaks on the controls that makes the experience way better than the Xbox 360 first version. Of course the changed some artistic details like the famous color grading but this is the ultimate experience (at least for now). - Also the Director's Cut version has a few new cutscenes which adds to the story. I will not spoil anything but I found the ending of the game one of the best from the last few years. Not kidding. - If you didn't get many side-quests the game has TONS of interesting details.  - 'DP Fix' exist!  (http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?p=438)  As it happened with Dark Souls Prepare to Die Edition. Deadly Premonition was a even more broken game on PC at launch. Consider helping the modder ;) Now we can play the game and even over-sample shadows, resolution, AA, AO etc.. The fix also let's to change textures, there are some HD Packs and button prompt if you want to use a Dualshock for instance.   Cons:  - Even with a monster PC you'll have some long loading times. I know there will not be a remastered definitive edition on the future. But if there was any chance, this is something that can help improving the experience A LOT. - You can loose some interesting character development if you don't explore Greenvale. Spy people on the windows!!   Notes:  - You can find 'Pillow Stains', the song from the former form of DP called 'Rainny Woods' check the trailer on YouTube:         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Rainy Woods TGS 2007 trailer&nbsp;
2688	was about to refund this game, but then got the durante fix and restarted my pc and the problems were mostly fixed. got stuck in a strange world where i was educated on southern tailed squirrels, biscuits, and random b movies
2689	I wrote a short 'review' a few years ago and i feel i like didn't do this game enough justice it deserves. What exactly is this game? That is a really good question. If you really want a better review just   read   this.   This is supposed to be a survival horror game, is it though? It's a murder mystery, you play as York (everyone calls him that) an fbi agent that investigate a serial killer leading to a small town. Once you start this game, you'll know that this game is bad. The story doesn't make sense, the dialogue is horrible, the cutscenes are attrocious, the gameplay are horrendous, the control is the worst. But it is also a wonderful experience that you'll never forget.   You'll dread the shooting so much with all the bullet sponge enemies, You'll accidentally press the a button and see the 'get out of car' animation a million times. You will also ask questions, a lot of questions. Why is the raincoat killer stopped chasing me after i evade one time? Why is there an old dude on a wheelchair wearing a gas mask? Why is there a jazz playing while i examined a body? Who is whistling that mario theme?!?   please get it out of my head.   And also    Who is zach?    Not all of that question will be answered. At the end of the game, the character will grow on you, you'll no longer ask the unecessary question, because it's deadly premonition.   But if it's all so bad, what makes it a good game, you ask. Deadly premonition knows that it is a bad B-movie and make it their strength. Sure you will be frustated, but that frustation is wiped by the laugh that you'll get. You'll laugh at it, thinking that it's bad, but that's also what makes it so good. It's also possible that you will hate it with passion, that is also fine. Because you gotta have a truly twisted mind to enjoy it. It's a genius of swery.  How exactly are we supposed to enjoy this game, ironically? Unironically? That is a question that will never be answered. Perhaps the saddest part of this game is this will probably be the one and only that ever comes out.
2690	Normally I find trying to get a game running a bit of a hobby, something fun. I want to really enjoy this game, it looks like it could be great to play, but unfortunately that's where it ends for me right now.  EDIT, I've got it working. I'm keeping it 'Not Recommended' for the faint of heart.   What worked:  Set compatibiltiy mode to 'Windows XP SP2', run as administrator Delete LAV Extensions Reinstall Physx Launch from the DP application and not the launcher  Using these setting will launch in windowed mode, if you want to run fullscreen create a shortcut of the DP.exe and then in properties type in '-fullscreen' within the target field.  So far it's reliable, but don't have a lot of hours in it at all yet. I like it A LOT so far. I recommend the game to those who don't have issues doing a little bit of work to get a game going. If you can't handle that, you really need to stay away from the title even though it really wasn't that bad to get started.
2691	The graphic and voice acting are really bad but The gameplay is good and the story and charachters are great too.If you are looking for a kinda game you haven't played before you can try this. Btw this game reminds me of resident evil 4 (I don't know why!) Anyway i'd recomend this game for people who are looking for a weird games ... 7/10
2692	fire walk with me
2693	The more I understand the mind and the human experience, the more I begin to suspect there is no such thing as unhappiness; there is only ungratefulness.
2694	  Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut
2695	Game itself is effin great and if you like off the wall stuff you'll remember this one. In between the superficially crappy writing, the confusing tone and badly implemented, clunky mechanics awaits a murder mystery that you just have to uncover yourself. I said the writing is superficially crappy: it's a ruse to lower your expectations and surprise you later.  Buy it discounted if you're fine with a DOS-era style port that will require fiddling with drivers, computer reboots and INI editing to bring it up to shine.  Technical addition: If you have issues with an Xbone controller (right analogue stick all messed up), it will require downgrading of your controller driver to an earlier version. See this forum post on how to get it working right:  http://pinnaclegameprofiler.com/forum/showthread.php?31550-Making-Xbox-One-Controller-Work-with-Windows-10-Please-Sticky 
2696	some things are like trainwreks, a million small errors comeing together to form a cluster of failure. deadly premonition is not like that however; with this game a million errors create something great. goofy and bizzare, but with a lot of heart, this game probobly has something everyone can laugh at.
2697	A great game in a bad port.   The bad port comes in the form of horrible graphics settings and crashes. Fortunately I was able to find workarounds for these issues making the game less of a âbadâ port, and more of a âdecentâ port. The first thing you will want to do is download the DPfix mod which will clean up some of the graphics for you. This does not solve the issue with crashing however. My experience with crashing was that the game would always crash at specific parts of the game, usually at the start of a cut scene. By this, I mean that the crashes were not random. The game would crash, I would reload the game, and it would crash at the exact same spot again. I found a workaround, which involved running the game in compatibility mode until you pass the part that crashes then disable compatibility mode after you save past the crash. By doing this I was able to enjoy the game and complete it with only a few technical issues.  Now for the game itself. The game in my opinion has a great story and cast. The characters have developed back stories, and the game keeps you guessing as to who is guilty of murder. The main character is particularly interesting in his mannerism. All in all, this is a case of a great game that didnât have enough money for that extra polish.   I would recommend this game to anyone whoâs looking for a good 3D adventure game with an interesting cast and story. 
2698	Yes, absolutely. There are technical problems, and crashes, but those can mostly be overcome, and if you persevere it's one of the best game story experiences I've had.
2699	I played this game with a friend on PS3 and while he hated it I honestly loved it. It's hard to say why with all it's flaws and rough edges, but I found it really enjoyable. It could be 'it's so bad it's good' sorta thing but I found the game compelling. In any case it's not for everyone, but if you enjoy quirky rough around the edges games or movies, it's certainly for you.   Also just call him York â everyone else does.
2700	Do not be decieved by my hours on steam. I have played over 200 hours of this game on Xbox 360 and PS3.  Swery65 is a genius. I was pulled in instantly. I loved the campy voice acting. I loved the tank controls. I loved the sillyness. I loved the characters.  I cried for an hour after finishing this. It goes on sale often. You will be in for one wild ride.  F.. K... In the coffee....
2701	This is one of the greatest games that I have ever played. It will definitely stay within my top 5 games for a long, long time. I plan to at least do a second and third playthrough, if not more.  Before buying, there are 2 things that you must know:  1. This is the very definition of a cult classic. If you find yourself only enjoying huge budget AAA games and never really straying into anything else, then perhaps this is not the game for you. This game must be played with an open mind, as it is very unique. Also, it is worth mentioning that the game really doesn't pick up until an hour or so into it.   2. The PC port is not very good. I would only recommend buying it if you have intermediate computer skills, as you are going to have to edit a few files as well as apply a user-made patch, DPfix.   The story: Simply put, it's amazing. You play as Francis York Morgan, an FBI agent sent to the small town of Greenvale to investigate the murder of a local teenager. The story quickly picks up from here and sucks you in. I wish that I could be less vague about the story, but I risk ruining the game's 20+ hour run. This is the kind of story that keeps you wanting to play the game to see what happens next. It takes many sharp turns and streches across several different genres, including, but by far not limited to: horror, mystery, survival, comedy, and even some romance. I consider myself to be good at predicting storylines in games and movies, but even I could not predict hardly any of this game. It truly kept me interested until the very end. Speaking of the end, you may just shed a tear.   Characters: The characters in this game are incredibly varied and all have distinct personalities. I will certainly not ever forget any of them. The voice acting is great and really helps to bring the characters to life.   Gameplay: The driving is pretty awful but far from the worst I've ever played. The pause menu map only shows your immediate surroundings and cannot zoom out, rendering it useless. You'll have to pay close attention and learn the town if you want to get around. While this map issue was mildly annoying, it made the game a little more challenging. The rest of the gameplay is good, but nothing new or super polished. I would recommend using a controller, as the keyboard and mouse control for this game just feels clunky. The game is open world and each character has a routine that they do. This is important to remember, as they may not always be home for you to ask questions. There are some points in the game in which you must wait a certain amount of in-game time before moving on to the next portion of the story. This gives you time to explore all that there is to do in Greenvale, including a ton of side missions and collectible items.  Soundtrack: The soundtrack in this game is great, and very memorable. I love the acoustic guitar song that plays at the main menu and at various points in the game. Each track suits the level that it was designed for, and nothing seems out of place. The only complaint I have is that the music volume levels occasionally overpower dialogue in cutscenes.   Other thoughts: The game crashed to the desktop about a dozen times during my playthrough. The crashes all occured at set points in the game's story, so they are not random. There are some suggestions to remedy this with a quick search online though. I had luck passing these crashes by setting the game's launcher and .exe to Windows 98/ME mode and running as administrator. I am using an AMD gpu with the latest drivers (15.7.1 at time of writing) and Windows 7 64 bit.   Bottom line: If you don't mind the possibility of some technical issues and you are a fan of survival-horror/mystery games, by all means, buy this game.
2702	  After 7 hours of play, I can say that this is one of the best games of which I had the pleasure of playing and I want to still play for much longer. This is an open world horror (which to me is splendid), which gives you various situations and things to do and explore. The city is fairly large and strongly recommend not to risk walking out because there are several places spread very far corners of the map, and so there are police cars to take you, and no, you are not a ride in this game you must control the car and it is possible both at first and in the third person. Something that caught my attention is the amount of commands to do so, beyond the standards, give arrow and have control over the lights at any time, as well as using the windshield when it is raining because the game there day transition and changes in time. For this reason the various possible locations may not always be available because everything has its time due to happen. There markets, gas station, houses and other various places to explore, and you can fish in certain places, of course with proper equipment to do so. All of these sites available no atoa, your character beyond the life bar and stamina, there is also the sleep bars and hunger. For this there is a hotel and some houses you have access to sleep in almost any location truth, if not all, it has a bed can rest. About hunger not always have time to go on the market and that is why there are machines where you can buy some food. This also applies to sleep, do not always have a bed available and the way is turn taking cafes stored in inventory. There is gun shop, but perhaps the most interesting is to get the weapons infinite ammunition obtained in side quests. The game has a police series style several years ago, full of stereotypical characters and cliched situations, the beginning of the keep itself has fragments of what happened in the chapter you are both in photos and with excerpts of speeches. Your character is an FBI agent and called Francis York Morgan, but he always says that it is to call him York, and I've got a 'special' name if I present myself this way and the other ignores it tends to say this for some reason did not like me. That's what happens when you present to the sheriff of the town of Greenvale, George Woodman calling York 'mrs. Morgan '. This ends up just causing a bad impression. You come to this city because the murder happened it resembles the other which has investigated, and so he joins the local police: the sheriff with his closed way of being, the beautiful Emily Wyatt and sweet Thomas MacLaine (Interpret 'sweet' as you prefer). In several game moments you can chat with Zach something or someone who is close to our protagonist, but that would be really someone or is it just a hallucination (a second personality perhaps?). In these conversations with Zach, they talk about various things such as films giving various details about the same as the actors, scenes, who is the director and so follows ... but it is more often when we are in the car, it is You can hear a real dialogue, at other times only York speech, apparently alone and this comes to interrupt others and occasionally other people wonder about such conversations with passengers also take place and it will you should tighten the button to start. Deadly Premonition despite being a horror game, occasionally happens comic scenes, however not all actually have felt in those moments stereotypes given much emphasis. Like when York eating a cookie at the police station and say you need to know where it was purchased because it is delicious at this time Thomas gets all embarrassed and bashful and says it was he who made ... (something that usually happens when the girl gets a compliment someone who finds beautiful or who she likes). Time failed typically receive punishments already expected to come face to face with the place closed or even end up getting a 'earful' lack of commitment to the case, as it is possible that the passage of operating time you are invited to remove and this will force you to 'spend time' in some way, perhaps one of the best ways is smoking (consumable item).  The gameplay takes place in three situations (places) different: the real world, the spiritual world and dreams. In fact, the real world to the spiritual is something reminiscent of 'Silent Hill', this transition usually occurs when the character you want to do something alone. On the game mode, it is quite simple, but the sight itself is very difficult to have control, but nevertheless it is possible to 'turn around' with what he has. The other commands usually respond well. Something I saw people complaining are the car's controls are terrible and you end up stuck in places, well I never had many problems, perhaps the fact that I always played first-person account for this. The car has also status, nothing else, just the physical condition and the amount of gasoline. However if you are in the middle of nowhere and end up having to leave the car do not worry, use the signal that exists in inventory and it will bring a new car for you (100% / 100%). The game also has moments of multiple choices and quick time events.  Things that caught my attention in particular: - The menu in the game which is very interactive} - Soundtracks that are great and together with the sound effects give a greater strain on the player. - There are secondary missions of various types: how to make a stretch in less time or find something and give it to someone. - In certain game moments are informative situations, such as in the car with Zach and they talking about movies or even a part of the beginning with Thomas where you need to find a key with a kind of 'squirrel' (if I'm not mistaken) of something specific and every key handed it says it is not right that speaks the characteristics of each species. - There are cards collectibles in the game. I do not know really say what happened to me, but this was perhaps the only game of this style that I felt committed to continue to play and I just loved it from its beginning until now (but I believe it will continue until its end) . Afraid I was very deceived with the game I was behind other analysis and had a completely different view from mine, I finally found one that was negative, talked about the graphics and gameplay treating them as bad, also spoke to this was a game considered a cult, but that could be seen as a masterpiece depending on the person.  tÃ­tulo: Deadly Premonition: obra prima ou pseudo cult?

2703	Twin Peaks as a Japanese Video Game. Bad port that tends to crash, but otherwise great.
2704	There are only two types of humans that roam this earth. Those that don't like this game and those that were birthed by the divine womb of Deadly Premonition to rise on high during endtimes and sit in judgement of those that are unworthy in both earth below and heaven above.  I count myself as the latter. Are you mortal or are you divine?
2705	One of the most memorable video games you'll ever play. The gameplay won't blow you away, but it has a great story, a ton of characters, and quite a lot of fun side missions and stuff to do.  You might be better off getting the PS3 or 360 version of the game, since the PC port is notorious, but there's a guide:  http://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Deadly_Premonition:_The_Director%27s_Cut  that can help with the most common issues. Just remember to save often.
2706	One of, if not the most divisive video games ever created, there's good and bad with this game.   To be fair, yes the game suffers from stiff controls, very outdated graphics and animations (even  when it first released as I understand it was to be a ps2 game originally), but for me, this game was like falling out of an airplane midflight, only to land safely in a hot tub at the Playboy Mansion on trampoline night.  To be sure, there's a definite influence from the tv show Twin Peaks (I've only seen the first episode of the show and can safely make this claim), but the supernatural story, the memorable weird and  unique characters you can't help but fall in love with, the twists, open world to explore, humor, atmosphere, and adventure that bleeds its own distinct charm, this is one I'll always remember.   Highly recommended despite its shortcomings, I would tell everyone to at least give this a try.  Or at the very least, watch a lets play.  The monkey screaming Squirrels in the opening cutscene should let you know exactly the sort of  experience you're in for.
2707	This review is for any one having trouble with the game, and my honest opinion. Firstly to get the game to work what i did was, go into steam/steamapps/common/deadlypremonition/redist. then scroll down until you find PhysX_SystemSoftware. Double click then click repair then start the game and it should work perfectly.  The game itself I have played multiple times on both xbox and playstation and is one of my favourite games, of all time. This port is kinda â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and its takes a certain patience. But the overall game kinda makes up for it. plus you can get get a bug fix online  http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?tag=dpfix.  kinda â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ service from the people who ported it but eh what you gonna do complaining won't do anything. Get the bug fix do the repair and have fun with the game. You need to play this game, isn't that right zach!
2708	There are two kinds of people: those who love this game and those who cant beat the hospital crash.
2709	Bless you based SWERY! You are the David Lynch/ John Waters to Hideo Kojima's Michael Bay/ John Carpenter.
2710	I listened to a lady drone on and on about her magic pot, I drove too fast and my car flipped sideways and went on for about 50 feet before correcting itself, I shot 360 bullets from a single magazine of a sub machine gun, smoked for 6 hours inside a guys trailer, then I stole his root beer from the cupboard. I had a wacky chase scene with a guy in a raincoat chasing me throwing an infinite number of axes at me, had a quicktime event that everyone has failed at some point or another. Finally I ate 3 hotdogs and slept for 12 hours.  11/10 GOTY
2711	'Do you feel it, Zach? My coffee warned me about it. Yesterday morning the milk I poured in my coffee made a sign. It said, âTomorrow youâll arrive in a place that will change your fate.ââ  2 out of 2 peaks.
2712	Zach, I think we've found a terrible port of an otherwise stellar game.
2713	Okay here's the deal with this game.  You really have to work through A LOT to get to the really good stuff. The game looks and runs like hot garbage. Framerate is atrocious, freezes and drops are frequent and completely random. Like, I had to play the game on two separate machines in order to get to the end. Driving is the worst you've ever seen, shooting is clunky and shooting sections are tedious. This game is a technical turd.  BUT, there is a good reason why Deadly Premonition is a cult hit.  The cast of characters, story, atmosphere, and the central mystery will make you chew through the issues if you're into Twin Peaks, can handle Lynchian, as well as general japanese weirdness, and non-linear storytelling. It's almost like this game has no right to be any good, but it has so much soul, and leaves you with such heartfelt goodbye, that you won't be able to anything but recommend it. Plus, it deals with some really heavy themes like child abuse, â¥â¥â¥â¥, transsexualism, and it can get very rough and creative when it comes to violence, down to straight up shocking. It goes beyond what most games try.  The great moments in this game shine so brightly, that you'll wave off the jank.
2714	ITS A REALLY GOOD JELLY SANDWICH. REALLY GOOD.   20 times better then Twin Peaks better story better graphics too better sandwich better killer better deadbodies better driving better pot better good looking chicks better good looking tun licks better dogs better best friends better police people better humor better long kitchen table better suits better weapons better killer better controls better cigs better weird stuff coming out of nowhere better crying scenes better everything F.K/10   okay, im going to bed now. Let's hope I don't have spookyjellydreams about red sunflower seeds.  
2715	i seriously loved playing the game,i first watched half of it as a let's play a and bought + played it all by myself.  many people (Especially developers) think let's play videos make less of their games sell,while if you ask me,they do the opposite. Many games get reviews and trailers...but often they can't really convince people to try a game since they do not know if it's worth it. Let's plays give them more a feel for the game and convince them to experience it by themselfs aswell.  i loved how the game turned from a crime investigation...to a horror hunt for a killer that could be anyone and anything,i wish the raincoat killer would have been fought in his outfit/Character...but besides that,i loved every aspect of the game.  if you guys like in depth mysteries,great soundtracks,characters and horror games in general...go ahead and purchase it,it's worth every coin and i would pay TWICE it's price just cause of how awsome it is,good job SWERY !
2716	Okay here's the deal with this game.  You really have to work through A LOT to get to the really good stuff. The game looks and runs like hot garbage. Framerate is atrocious, freezes and drops are frequent and completely random. Like, I had to play the game on two separate machines in order to get to the end. Driving is the worst you've ever seen, shooting is clunky and shooting sections are tedious. This game is a technical turd.  BUT, there is a good reason why Deadly Premonition is a cult hit.  The cast of characters, story, atmosphere, and the central mystery will make you chew through the issues if you're into Twin Peaks, can handle Lynchian, as well as general japanese weirdness, and non-linear storytelling.

It goes beyond what most games try.  The great moments in this game shine so brightly, that you'll wave off the jank.
2717	This game from what I have played so far, is really really good. The story and investigation is interesting and really makes you want to think about what could be right. The port of this is as bad as everyone makes it out to be, but DPFix tool can easily fix a lot of problems and restarting your computer once you have installed it fixes even more. Crashes are pretty rare, but they give a lot of save points so its been fine so far. Driving in this game is like GTA but even worse control and every surface is made of ice. The talks you have in the car passes the time by pretty well. The game is suprisingly humours while still able to keep a very good feel to the horror parts.  The level designs are extremely atmospheric and the music in this game is great. The developers reference reality and themselves throughout the game and its pretty nice to catch on to them when they do make them. The game feels like a PS2 game should, its not something I feel on most games now adays and its really good feeling to go back in time. I strongly suggest this game even with the crashing problems from the port, most problems can be fixed with enough research and the DPfix Tool
2718	This game is buggy, broken, and horribly optimized, but it's perfect in every way.
2719	Buggy. Meh graphics. Clunky to average gameplay.  Yet it's one of the best games I have ever played.  The story is so well written, it really overshines the bad.  Definitely a diamond in the rough.   I can't stress enough to really, honestly, give this game a try.  (If you're a Twin Peaks fan...this is a MUST play.)
2720	This is probably the most broken release I've ever purchased on Steam, and I do not regret it at all.  Fantastic game with some low-budget development that constantly shows, but has an amazing plot. The characters and plot alone justify this purchase despite that you  will  have to use DPfix to get the most of this experience.  That is all.  Buy it, you casual scum.
2721	Once you get used to or just ignore the Playstation2 generation graphics, you will find this game to be quite the gem of Twin Peaks &amp; the X-files translated through some Japanese artist &amp; game designer then translated back to English to make a highly intense mystery-action game with addictive music, humorously written &amp; deep investigation game full of horror &amp; wonder. Hooked on this game after seeing it on GiantBomb &amp; happy to play it again as it's that wicked good. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED (once you get used to the art/controls).
2722	Watching True Detective reminded me of this game. Which is good I guess, considering the show is pretty awesome. And from what I played thus far, so is the game. But I have yet to finish it, because the game just keeps on crashing. It is truly a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ port, so if you are not in the mood to try out different fixes and work-around â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t I don't recommend this game at all. Although if you can tolerate its quirkiness and don't mind the frequent crashes (thankfully it auto-saves often enough) it can be a really great game. I definitely plan on continuing it once it gets magically fixed by the video game fairies. Deadly Premonition is unlike anything out there. It's a wild ride. A wild ride indeed, Marty.
2723	A clut classic in every sense of the word. Clunky, messy and confusing from a gameplay standpoint but utterly captivating both terms of it's narrative and it's outlandish presentation. With endless moments that make you you cringe, smile and gasp. And sometimes all at once. It's not for everyone but it proves that one man's bargain bin trash is another man's game of the year.
2724	Like many people, I played the tutorial section of Deadly Premonition on the 360 and dismissed it as a cheap, ugly, unwieldy, cheesy afterthought.  It's not. Boy, is it not.  Imagine a game made by someone who watched Twin Peaks, loved Resident Evil 4 and doesn't have a cynical bone in their body. The jankiness of the PC port evaporated along with the essential widescreen patch (YMMV however) and what was left was something that was in equal parts charming, kooky and memorable. It's an action adventure that wears its influences with pride and revels in its clunkiness.  I get it now. Swery intended *everything*.  Can't recommend the game at full price though because although it chimed with me in a big way, there are going to be people who hate it (and I can't blame someone for having a different taste to mine).  With a large reduction, everyone should at least try Deadly Premonition - Just promise me you'll play past the prologue.
2725	Deadly Premonition What can I say?  The graphics are awful, the voice acting is bad, the controls are clunky, and the gameplay is iffy. There's really no real reason to buy this game from a technical standpoint.  But that's the beauty of it.  Ignore everything I just said. Ignore all of it.  Buy this game.  These guys deserve all of the awards for this game. Because even though it's a terrible, TERRIBLE game, it's a masterpiece.  Don't miss out on this game. Trust me, it's a once in a lifetime experience that you will NEVER forget. The story is worth it.  Do it.
2726	A â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up mix between Shenmue and Resident Evil.  Play if you want that PS2/Dreamcast era Nostalgia trip.
2727	This is by far the most interesting pile of absolute garbage I have ever had the brain grinding pleasure to wade through.
2728	the game is good on console  the true mystery is how to get this port working
2729	I love this game to death. (100+ Hours XBOX360) I'll be honest, this game is not for everyone. Should you choose to buy this game, one of these things will happen to you.  1. You'll immediately fall in love with the game, and the mood SWERY sets.  2. You will hate it, uninstall it, and DP will be one of those games in ur list that has only 30 minutes of total playtime and last played in years.  3. You slowly force yourself to play the game because it's 'CULT' and you inadvertently fall in love with it and become a fangirl/fanboy.   If you love this game, i recommend checking out SWERY's next game  'D4: Dark Dreams Don't Die'   10/10 IN SWERY WE TRUST.
2730	Twin peaks simulator 2013  If you want to bash Deadly Premonition, just go ahead. There's plenty of stuff here to strike down on. Poor graphics, the ocasionally terrible gamedesign, wonky animations, weird soundmixing, awkward gameplay, the map, bugs and the list goes on. But you would miss out on a truly unique and great experience. DP is the best FBI-sim/Twin peaks ripoff that money can buy. The story is the games strongest point, a weird journey that's totally unpredictable and fascinating. The games protagonist is Francis york morgan, a schizophrenic fbi-agent sent to investigate a murder in the small town of Greenvale. He is by far one of the coolest characters i've ever played, and the story and game largely rests on his twisted persona. The relationship with his other personality, Zach, is interesting and in the end truly touching. One of my favourite things about the game is the contrast between the wierdness, surreal parts and the ordinary mundane small town life. You can just cruise around, doing sidemissions and talking to the people of greenvale. also you can eat lunch, every game should give you the option of having lunch with some of the games characters. The day/night cycle is pretty slow, so you have plenty of time to hang around. The dpfix mod fixes some of the worst graphics and will enhance the experience alot. With that installed, just enjoy this game. It's sometimes terrible, other times beautiful, but always worth your while. For fans of Twin peaks and X-files, this is essential. Don't you agree Zach?
2731	This is by far the most interesting pile of absolute garbage I have ever had the brain grinding pleasure to wade through.
2732	a real gem if you can get past the horrible port
2733	Best game all year every year.
2734	Deadly Premonition is a game that David Lynch would have created had he been a Japanese game developer. It is strikingly similar to the television show Twin Peaks and one of the characters even bares an uncanny resemblance to an actress who played in 'Mulholland Drive', Naomi Watts. It's obvious the game's developers drew heavy inspiration from the show and Lynch's other works. If you ever wanted to play as Dale Cooper in a world so bizarre, spliced with elements of Silent Hill, then this is probably your best and only bet. Just be prepared for what is truly terrifying... a terrible PC port. Save often.
2735	This port isn't very good, it would be a better idea to play it on ps3 or xbox but if you really wanna play it on pc there are plenty of guides and mods that will help you get it running.
2736	its wrong in every right way!
2737	In the game, Deadly Premonition, the main character is recommended a sandwich consisting of turkey, strawberry jam and cereal stuffed between two pieces of bread. A few moments later, he declares it's the best. sandwich. ever.  That describes DP. It's a janky, open world game with poor controls, PS2-era graphics, the worst driving in any any game, and shooting controls that make you want to cry. The voice acting is painful (except York, the main character; I love that guy), and the character animation is so bad, I was shocked that they actually used motion capture for it. It's plot is a convoluted mess, liberally rips off Alan Wake, Twin Peaks, Resident Evil, Silent Hill, and with a touch of Cthulu mythos.... and yet....  And yet it's been one of my favorite gaming experience of the year. It's a game so bad that it flips back to good, to bad again, and edges back to good again. All the pieces are so bad, yet the whole was so satisfying in a crazy sort of way.  Now excuse me, I'm going to try that turkey sandwich. Maybe it will surprise me too.    
2738	Positive: game is somehow unique in some way (like Braid, Limbo, Alan Wake and etc.). I love those 'unique' games which you can't see every day.. So I try to play them all.. This game is based on Twin Peaks (main plot almost the same, some characters are very similar in some details) so if you're a fan of TP you must play. However, before buying please read negative side. I bought it for 7 euro and still think price for this poorly optimized game is still too big. If you played Dark Souls (which is titled as one of the worst ports) and thought that DS is worst port try this gameâ¦. DS only problem was locked frame rates and resolution although no other problems I noticed... Negative: ou boy... where do I even begin from..? Well, I guess Iâll write about everything what I didnât had positive opinionâ¦ Sound: music and other sounds is nothing awesome. Problem is that it may stuck and loop again and again at some point (had a car brake sound loop). Problem is that IF you save (stupid that I did it) when this problem is occurring you're stuck with it even after PC reboot. Strangely enough it fixed itself after I progressed 2-3 chapters. Thank god... Unless you want to hear everywhere stopping car sound (even through cutscenes!). Ragdolls/textures: during my gameplay I noticed few graphical issues (main character's tie was sticking from his belly to the back, sometimes his jacket mysteriously disappeared). It's nothing major although it annoys a little. Graphical look: this game looks like 2005 game. Well at least it is at acceptable levels. Enemies: during the whole game you encounter only 4 types of enemies (sure they have different appearance or carry different weapons, but the fact is that it is SAME enemies only they carry or looks differently): shadow, climbing shadow, birds, dogs. Not to mention that 2 types of these enemies you can even not to notice (I barely noticed them myself and never killed or had to kill one of those 2). Boses: during the whole game you encounter X (I wonât spoil exact number but itâs only a few) bosses and they all are a joke once you know their weak point.  Cutscenes: although it occurred to very few people but the cutscenes may be shown to you upside down. I was one of those unlucky people. How do you like that? I browsed internet and some other games had this issue. Itâs related to codec problems. Tried to install CCCP and K-Lite mega pack codecs but the problem persisted. (Good side is that there arenât a lot of them + subtitles are displayed correctly so if youâre as am I more interest in a story it wonât bother you a lot). Dungeons: once youâll play your 4th or 5th dungeon youâll realize that there is no benefit to kill enemies (except few times when they drop not ammo or medkits) because money is not an issue in this game. So you begin just run through them. These âdungeonsâ are boring and annoys a lot when you have to repeat them (if you want to collect all trading cards). Loading times: I store all my games on Samsung 840 PRO 500GB SSD drive (which is one of the fastest in SSD at the moment) and believe me when I say that you have to wait a LONG time to load this game different parts. I have to wait around 1 minute till it loads âPress Start buttonâ (if I had simple HDD I probably would think that game is crashed), for every cutscene to load (if the game wonât crash) Iâll have to wait around 2 minutes before cutscene and around 1 minute after cutscene, if I enter somewhere (i. e. house) Iâll have to wait around 1 minute too (this is especially annoying because for example in L4D2 I have to wait around 10-20 seconds to load next map and graphics there are at least twice better, hellâ¦ I can even compare this games loading to Windows 7 booting timeâ¦ AGAIN 10-20 secondsâ¦).  Optimization (crashes): why I said that 7 euros is a lot for this you ask? Well everything above I mentioned is forgivable if not the OPTIMIZATION problem (yeah I wanted to type in the uppercase letters). This game crashes whenever it wants: it crashes during the loading screen, during the driving, when you try to open your inventory, on really rare occasionâs game crashes right when you launch it, hell it crashes before or even after the cutscenes (I really enjoyed this when I finish chapter and there are a few cutscenesâ¦ It crashed 5 times till I got to the words: âDo you want to save?â I saved the game and it crashed AGAIN. Good thing that I could continue from the save). Soâ¦ In summary it crashes whenever it likesâ¦ Donât forget that this game starts to lag after 30 minutes of gameplay. During constant crash you even canât replay some chapters (I couldnât replay chapter 7 even after 20th tryâ¦). Not sureâ¦ Maybe crashes related to AMD card I haveâ¦ For those who gonna BUY THIS: use ALL available and possible fixes: Increase game launch exe file max RAM memory access to more than 2GB (yes, the game has memory leaks due a bad coding i. e. after 30 minutes of playing it increases ram usage from 200MB to more than +2100MB and starts to lag a lot). Note: this âincreaseâ method works only on 64-bit systems Use DPFix for desirable resolution (yes same story as Dark Soulsâ¦ Devs couldnât add support for high resolutions). SET DP.EXE and/or (I used same on both files) DPLAUNCHER.exe files to use Compatibility with Windows 98/ME and check mark âRun as an Adminâ. Shutdown your antivirus (at least for me it helped and crashes decreased even though whole Steam folder is added to antivirus exclusion listâ¦). And yeahâ¦ Never do anything to stress your computer during this gamesâ gameplay or you risking with crash (for me even once occurred a crash while I tried to make a screenshot with steam integrated feature). For those who doing all side quests: do them as soon as possible unless you want to experience more crashes (during chapter replay you cannot save) and to lose all your progress..  So if you still want to try your luck with this super SLOW and constantly CRASHING game be my guest. Just make sure that you apply all (or at least as much as possible) my suggestionsâ¦ That way your game may become almost playable (you minimize crashing number as much as possible).  And yeah although it annoyed me a lot I still liked game mainly due to it's story and gameplay :)
2739	Twin peaks was a weird show huh Diane?   Final score 8/10
2740	Well, it sure kept me up to date on my movie trivia.
2741	Played a few hours on it. Fantasic atmosphere, comedy, character and it seems to have a lot of depth. Really fun. PLaying it on windows 7 x64, it does have a bug but theres plenty of explainations how to fix it and its just 1 simple fix. No fps problems or glitches, plays well.
2742	Even with crashing during important cutscenes, crashing during gameplay, crashing when opening doors, and an altered color palette, it's still Deadly Premonition at it's core, and when you reach that core, with that sweet, sweet, beautiful nectar of Deadly Premonition, you will love it. Right before crashing and doing it again. So says Mr. Stewart.
2743	Go to where Steam is installed -&gt; SteamApps -&gt; common -&gt; Deadly Premonition The Director's Cut -&gt; redist. Scroll all the way down until you find 'PhysX_SystemSoftware' right click it -&gt; Repair wait a few second and *BOOM* the game should lunch! ______  Putting that a side, I'm more than 9 hours into the game and had 0 crashes. The only crash that I ever got was when I installed the game and tried to lunch it. Read a guide that told me to do what I wrote above and.. that's it.  Now, I got this when it was on sale and my gosh the game is a mess! But not that bad kind of a mess! It's amazing! It's impossible to explain, but I'll try my best... Take a bowl, put open world into it, then a bloody and a very horrible crime, elements of some comedy, a mix of good/bad controls, a mix of good/bad graphics, a mix of good/bad soundtrack, a mix of good/bad voice acting, cars that slide on turns, the best coffee with milk. Take all that, mix it up really good. Cook it for at least 20 hours and serve it to an FBI agent!!  Everything I wrote above made little to no sense? Well that just what it is! If you can handle a literally bloody story, then you should try it. Otherwise.. I don't think you'll like it. You have to risk it to get the biscuit. At least that's what I saw in my coffee..
2744	Having a good time as far as I played. Nothing quite like it. I got this on sale for $2.49 and I am not disappointed.  It's reminds me of games like Silent Hill and early Resident Evil.
2745	Amazing 10/10 Bad port. Better to play this game on console I suppose.
2746	One of the greatest games I've ever played.  The story is one of the best I've seen in a video game, the characters are all interesting and fun to interact with. There's tons of sidequest and stuff to explore.  The puzzles are also hard as â¥â¥â¥â¥, my fav one is when the game kept crashing and I had to run it in windows 95 compatible mode to get it to work.  This is a must have for fans of surealistic horror games like Silent hill or clock tower. Highly recomend that you get it for Xbox as the port is horrible, though entertaining. 
2747	it hurts me to see a masterwork of budget sitting at a 'mixed' review amount on steam.  people don't understand the Real Dealâ¢ when they see it. smh!!!! this is like a veritable fountain of lessons on game design. it works great as a 'what not to do' as far as engine development and bug testing and gameplay design, but its got so much heart and passion that it puts games of big budgets to shame when it comes to being a fun experience. infinitely better survival horror experience to any recent game by the dumb baby nerds at Capcom or Konami, even tho this game shamelessly apes off of their designs  admittedly though this port is a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ but hell people still like dark souls and bethesda games.
2748	I spent a few hours trying to get the game to work. It's crashed dozens of times. The graphics are awful. The port is basically a mess.  But despite it all this is one of the best games I've ever played. The story is great, the characters are quite interesting and the silly quirks will just make you laugh till your sides hurt.   If you like a good story and enjoy well written characters then you won't want to put this cult classic down for a second. Don't forget to use DPFix!
2749	The best terrible game ever. Truly great if you can get past graphics, and voice acting, and mechanics.
2750	If Haruhi were to write an adaptation of Twin Peaks, this would be the result.
2751	Aside from the crashes, and visual DEFECTS this game has gone through it's up there in my top 5 games. It's optimal to play this with a controller, and there's mods to fix a lot of this game up.
2752	Amazing 10/10 Bad port. Better to play this game on console I suppose.
2753	One of the worst ports ever. However the game is just a fantastic mess and if you can pull through the terrible performance then you are gonna love it. Keep your standards low for this one though.  If you have a Xbox 360 or PS3 I would recommend getting it on one of those instead. I just cannot get this game to perform properly even with fixes. The PS3 version is most likely the best one to get because the controls aren't a broken Resident Evil 4 rip off like the Xbox version, and the PS3 version has graphical and gameplay fixes too; along with an extra ending.   However then you might have some framerate issues. In that case, if anything, the more broken the better. You're then getting the true Deadly Premonition experience. I recommend the game, NOT this awful port.
2754	Great game, however it is quite buggy and crashes a lot. Buy on console if you can; but its still good on PC if you can be bothered with all the fixes etc.
2755	Nominated for the 'Game within a game' Award.  (Review updated 11/23/2016) I first played this game many years ago on the Xbox 360. I then got it on steam from my better half.  I started to play it ( back in the day) because it looked silly.. AND at the time it got a review of 1/10 ( that has since been changed to a better score) but the game showed me it was much more than silly voice acting and odd characters.   This is a wonderful game with a deep story. VERY campy. Based around a show called Twin Peaks. Yes, there are some issues. Controller issues, things like that.. but playing the game is worth it even with the small issues.  This game is not for everyone! As i said it is very campy. Some might not understand this.( or it is not their type of humor) Try to give it a chance you might love it.   There is a mod out there to make the game easier to play ( more choices for screen size, better map and that) It is called DPfix 0.9.5 (  http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?p=438  ) be sure to get the newest one. I gave an older one by mistake and the map was so messed up.  Watch these videos to see! (I think it was the wrong one for 9 eps.. OOPS!! That was my fault. I am sorry.)         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Let's Play Deadly Premonition (part 1 - MY EYES!! [blind])&nbsp;
2756	'The balance of milk and butter you've achieved here... oh my...'
2757	If Haruhi were to write an adaptation of Twin Peaks, this would be the result.
2758	The definition of so bad it's good. What the game lacks in control and gameplay it makes up for in solid story, quality voice acting, memorable characters, and a genuinely interesting series of plot twists.   The game frequently goes on sale for $2.49 so theres no reason you shouldn't own this masterpiece.  Isn't that right Zach?  (This is my favorite game. I have a 360 copy factory sealed in box which has already tripled in value since release.)
2759	I don't think I've spent more time on the starting menu on any other game than this.  This is not a game, this is an art.
2760	As much of a trainwreck as it is a masterpiece. A must play
2761	This is a terrible game. The controls are wonky, the actual gameplay is repetitive and it's full of QTEs. The PC port is a total disaster that barely works, crashing every 30 minutes and lacking basic 16:10 monitor resolution support, meaning I played the game with everyone being rather more skinny then they should be.  This is also one of my favourite games of all time. In every other way it's indescribably magical. Playing this game is like a religious experience.
2762	Let's just get something out of the way here: this port is one of the worst ports I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing. Even after following a lengthy list of instructions and applying the DPFIx, DP: Directors' Cut features a butchered, shoddy port that is prone to frequent crashing, weird speed ups and slow downs, bizarre physics mishaps, corrupted saves, and a really, really weird issue where playing for more than two hours in one sitting can result in some... interesting... consequences for the engine.  And even if the game wasn't completely broken, it still suffers from a myriad of problems. The combat is abysmal. Not only does it feel tacked on, it literally is tacked on, as confirmed by Swery65, who explained that his publisher forced the decision in an effort to garner more sales. The combat is tedious, featuring only two distinct enemies: ones that die quickly with no effort and ones that take up five minutes of your time in pure tedium â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. If the combat is supposed to provoke a challenge, it is easily negated by how easily you can cheese the gameplay by acquiring infinite ammo and durability weapons early in the game, but not even instakill weapons can save you from a never ending supply of quicktime events.  Disregarding the gameplay, the graphics are incredibly poor. I'm not one to turn my nose at dated graphics, as some of my favorite games are before Steam was even a thing, yet Deadly Premonition released in 2010, the same year as Red Dead Redemption, Halo Reach, and Mass Effect 2. Going up against these games graphically is a bit ridiculous when the game looks like it came out in... 2006, but whatever.  At this point, you may be wondering why there's a postive thumbs up next to my review, since I've done nothing but trash Deadly Premonition. Well, the truth is that this game is the best worst game I've ever played. Like I've pointed out, there's just so much wrong with DP: DC, and yet, it's an incredible experience. All of the characters are well written and lovable, and all form a cohesive, believable community and setting. Dialogue is as bizarre as it is hilarious, and trust me, there is plenty of writing to enjoy. Weird quirks dominate the scene, such as having every single character follow a routine and schedule based on a variety of factors, and allowing sidequests only when the time is right, and pulling those sidequests away from you if you're too slow to grab them. Additionally, Deadly Premonition has care in weird areas that I've not seen in other games before, like letting you use your turn signal in a vehicle, or having your character be able to grow a beard and shave it regularly, or most unique of all, having your character sleep under the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing blankets.  Name me one game that lets you sleep under the covers besides Deadly Premonition.  ... *Ahem*  All in all, Deadly Premonition is a bizarre, flawed, hilarious, witty, diamond in the rough. It has a ton of bad, but if you're willing to put up with the bad and push through, you'll discover a truly unique experience that no other game will ever deliver quite the same.
2763	Well this is the best experience i have ever got from a video game, mixed with some really annoying designer choices. It is absolutely not a game for everyone, but if you can look past the problem on the surface you will find a very interesting and touching story with great characters. Personally, i am not going to forget this game ever.
2764	It's Twin Peaks: The Game. It's weird, it's wonky, the animations are terrible and some parts are so poorly written that I burst out in laughter when I played through them. This is one of the best games I have ever played.
2765	I came to this game, as the creator did... directly after watching all of Twin Peaks. I had never seen the show, so I found it more than a little queer to play a game which cribbed so heavily from it; Not to say it doesn't build into it's own thing. It's very unimpressive for a few hours...then... I COULD NOT STOP PLAYING! Francis York Morgan is one of the most dryly hilarious characters ever in a videogame, at least some of which is intentional.  The most annoying parts where driving, especially in rain, and the one hang-up when you are literally fishing for a clue in the investigation. Even though I was sitting there like an â¥â¥â¥ losing at a roulette wheel repeatedly, I had to know what happened next in this surreal, unpredictable story. It's like the game was written/acted in the 90's with 2003 graphics. It's horrible as a game and highly recommended as a cross-cultural curiosity. The fact that the protagonist talks to a voice in his head, which can double as you, the player, is insanely brilliant. I want to play a solid, polished, 90 metascore game now, but York is calling me back for a second playthrough, 'Are you there, Zach?'
2766	7/10 - This game - much like our main protagonist - is split into two halves.   On one side, it's a mechanical mess. Dialogue sometimes cuts off near the end of a sentence, music suddenly stopping while driving around, awful car controls, from the game randomly crashing, the impractical purchasing system which makes you buy one SINGLE item over and over instead of in bulk, its lengthy driving around town sequences (although teleportation makes this bearable later in the game), right down to some of its spoilerific achievements (seriously don't read them).  But on the other hand you've got a weird and wonderful world with a host of fascinating quirky and cooky characters you'll be talking to, in order to unravel a mysterious murder that has happened in this quaint little town as FBI detective Agent Francis York Morgan, who in and of himself is a very unusual man. In this, you will uncover an intriguing storyline of who-done-it that never gets stale or boring and makes the game very compelling. There's also a host of extra things to be done in Greenvale, with its numberous side quests, fishing and racing.  It is because of its story and characters that this game belongs in the upper echelons of 'Weirdest game I've ever played', ranking up there with the likes of Gregory Horror Show.   If you can get past its technical faults, its definately one to experience. 'Isn't that right, Zach?'
2767	This is one of the best games I have ever played. I beat it on ps3 and bought it immeadiately again for PC cause I really love this game. Yea it's not a major triple A game, and honestly, graphics, animations, gameplay while it's not super duper amazing, its amazing in it's own way. This is the definition of a niche title, and this has a great story and a enjoyable experience overall and I highly reccomend it. Sure it may be a lazy port but there is a mod online to fix it, I like the way it is however and it controls fine without a controller so I didn't bother with it. All in all this is an amazing game, right Zach?
2768	Deadly Premonition is known for being the most polerizing Survival Horror game ever made.  That means people love it or hate it. I personally say this is my 2nd favourite game ever.  The plot goes like this a, girl called Anna has been murdered in the small town of Greenvale and hung to a tree, where 2 small boys called Isaac and Isaiah find her. So the F.B.I send Special Agent Francis York Morgan, to go solve the murder.  So pretty much it is Twin Peeks.   Gameplay and graphics are terrible but, you don't play this for that, you play this for the Fantastic story and characters and dumb dialogue.  Francis York Morgan is probably my favourite video game character ever, next to Raziel of Soul Reaver.  He is Smug and a â¥â¥â¥â¥ to other characters at first. He also talks to himself referring the person he is supposedly talking to as 'Zach' But I will not spoil how that ends. York is a very likeable character, and he has some of the bizarre dialogue you'll probably ever hear.  Speaking of bizarre, the entire game is strange. I can't really explain how. You just have to play it or watch videos on it.   The gameplay goes from linear missions, to Free-roam. The Town of Greenvale is pretty big but navigation is terrible and the map is next to useless.  You probably will learn your way around the town.  Or you can do a side quest that gives you Fast Travel, but by using fast travel you're missing out on the dialogue York says while driving.  While you're driving around York talks to Zach about...Movies. It comes right the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of nowhere and it's brilliant.   In the Linear missions the game goes all Survival horror on you! 'The game is not scary at all. It is more funny than scary.'  The enemyâs you fight 'all 1 of them' are called Mysterious Shadows.  They look like zombies with clown make up on.  And they make stupid noises when they die.  The shooting works but it wonât blow your mind or anything but it works. Melee weapons work decently.   The game's soundtrack is superb! The music sometimes goes from SUPER SERIOUS!!! To comedy relief.  It's baffling when it happens.  The game in general is 'unintentionally' funny.  The other characters like the sheriff George Woodman and Deputy Emily Wyatt are brilliant.  There is one character called Harry Stewart who wears a Gas mask and doesn't talk.  He has an assistant at all times called Michael Tillotson who talks in rhyme all the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing time.  There is, plenty of other characters too but this would be 5x longer than it already is.   Deadly Premonition as Jim Sterling put it is a beautiful train wreck, so terrible so awful but yet, so beautiful you can't look away. I want everyone to at least try this gem once. You might end up loving it as much as I did. 10/10 Also I would love to thank my good friend Niall for showing me this masterpiece of a gem. Keep your chungus sexy you beast!
2769	I played through this game on the Xbox 360 years ago, the play time listed for this version doesn't reflect that. Bought this a second time on sale because it's good and I like the developers.  When Deadly Premonition released years back, it was slammed by mainstream sites such as IGN for its subpar graphics and archaic controls. Technically these reviewers pointed out the flaws this game has as a reviewer should, but they missed the magic this game seems to have for the players that love it.  For everything this game seems to get passable or 'middling', there's something that makes you smile. Driving is boring, but the conversations York has with himself make the long trips you have to take early in the game worth it. You also do unlock and find better weapons and even some helpful abilities that make going around town easier later in the game.  Fans of Twin Peaks will get a more out of Deadly Premonition than other players. I'll even go so far as to say that this is a must play if you like Twin Peaks. There are plenty of subtle and not so subtle nods to that short lived television series. The protagonist loves his coffee. The town this game is based in feels quite similar to Twin Peaks and has quirky, memorable characters.   This was one of my favorite games of 2010. If it's on sale I strongly recommend giving it a try. 
2770	Solve crimes.  Fight zombies.  Talk to your imaginary friend.  Shave your beard.  Oh â¥â¥â¥â¥ is that a giant zombie dog behind my car?  That is a giant zombie dog behind my car.  Don't read the achievements' descriptions.  FUN.
2771	This game is truly one of the strangest games you'll ever play, but that's why it's brilliant.  It'll take some time to adjust to the clunky combat and annoying driving segments, but the story, the humour and the characters are all excellent.  I loved this game.  Not many people know about it, but don't be afraid to grab it! Highly recommended.
2772	This game is almost unplayaple. Not because the story and the game sucks but because of the crashes. This is a awful PC-port of a game. I would not recommend buying this with it's current price of 25 euros. If the price was like.. 5 to 3 euros you should buy this even tought you don't have a fat chance of playing this game trough without spending most of the time fixing crashes and bugs.  Still the story and Twin Peaks feels give this game my recommendation. Just don't buy this game with the absurd price of 25 euros.  EDIT: After 4 hours of fixing this game installing patches etc. it's semi-playable but remember to save freaking often because it will crash even tough you have done all the steps to prevent that from happening.
2773	Get some wine to go with this cheese. Quality video game. Its like Resident evil 4 had a bad relationship with Grand Theft Auto while also cheating on it with Dreamfall and somewhere someone had a kid that is this game and nobody knows who the father is.  Also fishing.  
2774	It's like Stephen King wrote script and David Lynch directed... (sic!) a videogame! A videogame that didn't suck! Highly recommended!
2775	This game is almost unplayaple. Not because the story and the game sucks but because of the crashes. This is a awful PC-port of a game. I would not recommend buying this with it's current price of 25 euros.

2776	Horey shet, this game is great.  First things first though, while 'directors cut' is slightly different from the original on the consoles, its a horrible PC port. Luckily theres a fix for most of the issues and if you disable steam overlay, you can play it, crash free prettymuch. Just dont alt+tab or do anything outside the game while playing.  I absolutely love this game, its very story/character focused and both of those two are just batshit insane in a very charming way. The characters are so much fun, the story is interesting and keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way. The gameplay however is clunky, weird and feels like some really old Japanese RPG's in many ways and shares the many gripes that Jap games in general have, which would be clumsy menus, unnecessary button prompts here and there ect, but oddly enough, it didnt bother me that much. Killing baddies is kind of funny, but the general atmosphere is great and quite spooky at times too.  All in all, I'd say that get this on some console if you want to play it without any issues from the start, or get this PC version and be prepared to fix its many issues. Its an amazing, crazy, weird, funny and extremely interesting.  I'd r8 it an 8/8 m8, no h8.
2777	55 hours and I finally finished this game.  Bugged, cheesy, crappy animation, lots of stupid â¥â¥â¥â¥ing crashes all the time (thanks for the awesome port). You'll have to save your progress. Don't you ever forget! Because crash will catch you off-guard. Fan made fix for this game is almost required! Music is out of place almost all the time, it can switch from drama to comedy at any second.  But! Story was great. It always finds the way to surprise you, lots of symbolism will guide through this journey. It feels deep, rich and dark. Like a good cup of black morning coffee. This case was not easy to solve. Right, Zach? 8/10
2778	I would give this game a 10/10 if it didn't randomly crash on me. It's very unique, the story is great, the voice acting is good, gameplay is fun. The music is a little weird at times, and it doesn't seem to fit the situation. I get a good steady 60fps at 1440p using DP fix.
2779	55 hours and I finally finished this game.  Bugged, cheesy, crappy animation, lots of stupid â¥â¥â¥â¥ing crashes all the time (thanks for the awesome port).

2780	It's Twin Peaks: The Game. It's weird, it's wonky, the animations are terrible and some parts are so poorly written that I burst out in laughter when I played through them. This is one of the best games I have ever played.
2781	Perfectly dysfunctional.
2782	So, let's get this straight: this is a TERRIBLE game. But I love it so much. Now to explain why I feel this way.  Deadly Premonition follows the story of a quirky FBI detective, Francis York Morgan (just call him York), as he and his imaginary friend Zach solve the mystery behind the murder of a young women, Anna Graham, in the fictional town of Greenvale, Washington. It's a classic 'who dun it', story, which slowly melts more and more into the bizzare, and stange as you get further along into the game. It should be said, that this game clearly takes HEAVY inspiration from the 90s TV series Twin Peaks, which follows a similar story of a detective unravelling the murder of a young women, which also slowly gets more and more surreal as the series gets further along in it's story.   The gameplay, and graphics are by far where most concerns arise regarding the game, with shoddy aiming, terrible driving while you drive around the town doing either the main quest, or the various other sidequests,  bad textures, some character models look like ones you'd see in PS2 games, bad framerate, etc. Some gameplay decisions made in this game can be extremely baffling in how poorly designed they are. These are by far the games weakest aspect, and are honestly sometimes a hassle to play through. But, however I believe the game makes up for what it lacks in its characters, and overall quirkiness.   I cannot tell you how many times I smiled, or gave a chuckle to the characters interacting with each other, I won't spoil any of these moments, as you should most definately experiance for themselves, but I can say that if the game hits any nail on the head, it is most definately in this aspect. Some may find some distaste in the campy/cheesy/sometimes downright TERRIBLE diolouge in this game, but I personally loved it, and I found myself getting excited when I was playing through the game, and a cutscene would appear, because it meant I would get a chuckle or two out of it. Something should also be said about the soundtrack, as it fits the surreal, quirky atmosphere of the game perectly. The game is also quite lengthy, with various sidequests you can do, in addition to the main story.  Now, many people wouldn't find this justification to buy this game, that the gameplay and graphics completely ruin the experiance, but I would seriously disagree. It seems to me that this game had a lot of love, and effort put behind it, but the game developers skills just didn't match up to what they were hoping would turn out. As I said, some may not like this game, some may even hate this game, but to those who want a different experiance, something that is out of norm, and completely changes the way you would normally think about games, I'd say give this game a go. I've bought this game three times already, on the Xbox 360, PS3, and of course PC, and I haven't regretting buying a single copy. This game will give you a unforgetable ride, which must be played to be believed. In my opinion, this is without a doubt, the best worst game I have ever played. AND I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT.  
2783	I have nothing but complete adoration for this game. It gives off a hilariously off putting first impression, but when you put time into it the game gives you an incredibly enjoyable experience. My only regret is that I played it on the PS3 version with the Move controller so you can guess how well that went.
2784	This game man. This is one of the only games that I can't really explain to people at all. You either 'get it' or you don't. It's a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game, don't get me wrong. However, behind all the cornyness, jankyness, bad voiceacting, bugs, terrible gameplay, terrible driving, etc. There is something so god damn geniuine about it, something with all of it's elements mixed together creates something beautiful and emotional if you are the type of person that can connect with it. Perhaps similar in a way to all the b-movies York seems to love so much.  It feels like all the very odd, surreal, quirky, sad, and happy aspects of life enhanced by the even more odd, and quirky low-budget japanese game design. And you take that, and you put Swery's special b-movie twist on everything. What comes out is a true, very long, adventure with some of the most memorable characters and stories in gaming today. If you are the kind of person that can really connect with it. I don't want to sound insulting, but I don't think most people will 'get it' without having a certain type of taste and perspective on things.
2785	Terrible shooting mecahnics, terrible gameplay, kinky animation, terrible(as for 2010) graphics and yet this game is a masterpiece. Storyline, soundtrack and style are all you need to fall in love with this game
2786	Deadly Premonition is a one of a kind game. I've never seen anything anything like it and I probably never will again. It's unique in many aspects, but the most important ones are: setting and pacing.  It's set in Greenvale, a fictional small town in USA, which has become the scene of a brutal, ritual murder. The player controls an FBI agent sent to carry out the investigation. There are many similarities to Twin Peaks as the game generally tried to capture the 'feel' of that TV show and referenced it many times. This is why I consider this game unique - you're not shooting up gangs, terrorists or whatever, you're slowly getting to know inhabitants of Greenvale and drive from one place to other talking to people and trying to make sense of the case. While the game has quite a few action sequences, they're not what's most important, in fact they are very easy and poorly done.  What's bad about this game? A LOT. While it's an open world 'detective' game, it's very linear and doesn't have many opportunities for the player to show off his cleverness. The controls for both the character and cars are clunky. The game generally, from player animations, to map design, lacks polish. The PC port is atrocious, probably the worst I've ever seen. Graphics are PS2 tier, don't even try to play without DPfix and SweetFX. The game regularly crashes, always loads slowly, doesn't allow alt-tabbing in fullscreen mode, has broken sound on non-stereo audio configurations, etc etc...  Deadly Premonition is completely broken, there's no point in listing all its technical flaws, because there are just too many of them, Yet I'm still recommending it. Why? Because it's one of those 'love it or hate it' kind of games. I don't even know why I loved it, but when it crashed on me, I always just restarted it and kept playing.
2787	Buggy, unfinished port of one of the most memorible games ever made. Hopefully they fix this but considering what it is, that is a longshot. Go find a 360 copy.
2788	If you will ignore game's poor technical level, this game will be very interesting to play. The story, the setting, the execution of a detective's genre, each of them is very good. I never actually thought that there are detective games with mysteries, but this game's concept actually turned out pretty well.
2789	Yeah, this game has its share of problems. The PC port of the game is terrible, and I am glad I got to experience it on a console. It was only recently I decided to revisit the game on PC, and the amount of times it just crashes for no reason at all is just silly.  If you are a person that require decent graphics (you know, the visuals), then this game is not for you. In fact, the graphics are so poor for its time in this game that it looks more like it was released during the PS2 era, when it was in fact released during the PS3 era (I am using the PlayStation as a reference because it was on a PS3 I played this game the first time). They aren't particularly good, but if you can overlook this, then you're in for the next challenge.  The controls. Geezus. Who sat down with the driving part of this game and thought 'Yeah, yeah this is perfectly acceptable.'? Regardless of what platform you are playing this game on, the driving itself is way to challenging for its own good. Sure, it makes you laugh a bit the first time your car is suddenly on two wheels and spinning out of the road and into a ditch, or a house, or another car. But the fifth? Tenth? Twentyeth? Not so funny anymore. And the combat. Ugh. It can't require that much more polishing to actually get the combat controls improved, can it? Because the most challenging part about combat are the controls, rather than the enemies. And that's not the reason you want your game to be a challenge.  But, this aside, I still enjoy this game, and I still recommend this game. Why? Because of the story and the atmosphere. It is so rare to see a game where each and every character you meet feels well thought out and unique. Where the story of the game may not be super original, yet still manages to suck you in and surprise you with its many plot twists. It was my second playthrough recently (though it had been a few years), and I was still surprised by a few of the plot twists. And that's something special. This game is special. And if you like a good story, then this is something you cannot afford to miss.  Edit November 2016: Just nominated this game for The âTest of Timeâ Award. It truly is a gem that should be experienced.
2790	Despite having no right to be, this is one of my favourite games. It's utterly bizarre but I love it to bits. Please play it. It's a weird gem with some utterly horrible gameplay but it is somehow special.
2791	Gameplay is a little repetitive and clunky and there are some technical difficulties/limitations, but the story and characters are so weird and engrossing that you want to finish the game no matter what.
2792	Mixed. The game itself is charming and unique, they put love in it. But it has problems - both gameplay-wise and technical issues. Wait a bit until it would be patched up and don't miss it if you are fan of Twin Peaks-like stuff!!!
2793	Heyyo, 'Do you feel it, Zach? My coffee warned me about it.' Err... what? lol. Yep! This is a weird game... but weird in a good way. An oddly budget feeling, good way indeed. :P  I want to start this recommendation off with the major strength of this game and what will have you coming back despite the flawed gameplay and that is the story. You play as Fracis York Morgan, 'But please, just call me York. That's what everyone calls me.' Is the main character of the game who came to a small town to investigate a supernatural murder case and try to solve the mystery of why his most recent cases all have red seeds in them and where they are coming from.  The small town is filled with a pretty diverse set of characters and I think thatâs the biggest strength in this game. Itâs interesting to hear what they have to say and what kind of odd or oddly humorous things they have to say.  The gameplay, as stated earlier? Yep, itâs quite flawed haha. The controls feel a little clunky and the aiming takes a while to get used to and donât flow as smoothly as for example Resident Evil 4 or 5. The worst offender in the gameplay though? The vehicles. There is a small open town to drive around and the camera can give you motion sickness due to a bug that they never fixed in this port... For example, when you turn your car to the left? The camera pans slightly to the right and vise-versa. It messes with your brain and I found for the first few hours that yes, I was getting headaches or even a little nauseous as youâd expect the camera to pan in the same direction of the vehicle.  Second? The vehicles physics are some kind of weird mix between Mafia 1âs and those budget games youâd find on a rack at a gas station. Vehicles constantly clip in the ground when taking the exploratory paths, taking some corners too fast cause your vehicle to flip way too easily as if the weight of the vehicle is non-existent in this calculation and the engine sounds can sometimes be quite annoying.  So yeahâ¦ vehicles? Definitely the worst part of the game. They will annoy the crap out of you. In the PS2 era this game came out? We had good arcade vehicle physics from the likes of GTA 3 as a prime example of how they should have gone about it. But? I donât know the development cycle and I donât know their budget (which feels VERY tight btw) so this may have been an area that they didnât focus inâ¦ but at least they should have fixed the damn camera pan when they made this PC port. :P Oh, one warning about this port? It can be quite unstable. As nice as it is you get bonus points for remembering to use phones (to manually save your game) there are times you will get screwed over especially during side-missions where the game will crash and cost you time if you donât saveâ¦ so itâs up to you if you wish to use manual or auto saving (toggled in the options menu).  There are guides out there to resolving this, but I found using either Windows XP SP3 compatibility mode or Windows Vista (no service packs) got me through the full game along with this precompiled mod setup found here:  http://www.gog.com/forum/deadly_premonition_directors_cut/essentail_mods   Hope this helpsâ¦ so says, Mr. Stuart. ;)
2794	Damn fine cup of coffee.
2795	This game is good, can you feel it Zach? My coffee told me so
2796	It's like resident evil on drugs, coffee and stock chimpanzee sounds
2797	This is one of the most memorable and unique videogames I've played in my life...and believe me, I've played A LOT!  It's really hard to describe what makes this experience work but it does. Is it the atmosphere? Is it the narrative? Is it the characters?  This game is a hit or miss. You either like it or not. As for me, well, I became obsessed with this game while I played it and while I didn't...so much that I went for the 100% completion.
2798	A near masterpiece, yeah I said it. Deadly Premonition tells the story of FBI Agent Frances York Morgan as he travels to the small city of Greenvale to solve a ritualistic killing which he thinks may lead to more. Deadly Premonition is a third person survival horror game with bits of comedy in it. You may think that sounds weird but it works very nicely. The comparisons to the TV show 'Twin Peaks' are incredibly valid in setting, characterization &amp; situations. I don't want to give away the story of Deadly Premoniotn as it's without a doubt the main draw. Agent Morgan goes into an 'other world' when he's profiling and searching for clues. Here is also where you'll do some combat and a bit of minor puzzle solving. The story is so engrossing that you'll want to push ahead just to see the cutscenes which include great dialogue and voice acting. NOW the bad news. Deadly Premonition is a buggy console port. The graphics are dated but serviceable. The biggest gripe is without a doubt the controls. To shoot guns is incredibly clunky as is the ability to use items. The driving is without a doubt some of the worst I've played in any game. Pole Position for the Atari 2600 is a breeze compared to this. And until you get the radio (if you ever do) you will drive A LOT. The two three tiered boss fights at the end also overstayed their welcome, the last being especially being an issue with the known aiming issue. This game is also very lengthy as it took me 30 hours to finish with only a few of the side missions completed. You will get your money's worth. Don't let the slow start fool you. The wonderful atmosphere, unusual music cues, the great story and amazing cast of characters more than make up for the many issues this game has. This game truly is not for everyone but I enjoyed the heck out of it. An easy 9/10 from me.
2799	This game has dull gunplay, horrible driving and breaks all of the time. This is one of the best games I have ever played and everyone should play it to the end.
2800	A bad port of an already creaky game, the first enemy you will face in this game is the game itself. Google DPfix - the patch made by a saintly individual who also rescued the Dark Souls port - as this is essential. The controls will annoy you, the generally clunkiness will annoy you, and the combat will definitely annoy you.  But here's the thing: I'm recommending it, and rather forcefully. From a technical standpoint it's terrible, and don't get me wrong, it's shocking, but the actual content of the game acts as a huge counterweight. You'll get over the annoyances and get sucked in to this little town, in which you can get up to what you're supposed to be up to as an FBI agent, or simply dawdle, have lunch at the diner, go fishing, then get hammered a bar in the evening. You spend your time in this town however you choose to, and although the main plot is always there, waiting to progress and conclude, there's always time to just enjoy the town. This is one of the few games in which you, as an agent of the law, can make the active choice to just have a day off - and that doesn't mean just pausing proceedings, it means potentially finding interesting side-stories as you take it easy.  For all that it lacks in the technical department, it does something that the Elder Scrolls games are vocal about doing but have yet to actually achieve: a convincing town, with people acting as individuals with their own priorities and schedules. I can't think of another game in which this has been achieved quite so well.
2801	Squirrels scream like chimpanzees. 10/10
2802	Because it's like Twin Peaks but MORE mental.   That said, it's a real mess of a port, and the patches still haven't fully fixed it. You have to get used to saving at every opportunity so that frequent crashes to desktop won't ruin too much progress.  But even in spite of that, it's still really worth having if you have an appetite for strange.
2803	Deadly Premonition tries so hard to be Twin Peaks and a survival horror. Because of the lack of fundings, the entire game feels like a cheap Twin Peaks/Resident Evil 4 knock off but not an awful knock off. Just cheap. People tend to have mixed feelings about this game. People seems to adore it, while others just can't stand this game. I understand both statements. If you can bear the awful pc port, awful survival horror part; go ahead. If you are a Twin Peaks fan, you gotta give this game a try. Even if you don't like it, you have to agree that this game has a cult following since its release.
2804	just a reminder that this is the best game to come out ever
2805	One of my favorite 'cult following' games. You will ether love it, or hate it's oddball charm. I like my 'F.K... In the coffee!' I hope we get a sequel someday.
2806	As I kept playing, I've come to love this game's bulls***t. There's so much to like about it that I found myself ignoring a lot of errors and problems with the game. So, as a video game, this is actually a bad one. But as someone's vision, as a project, it's some kind of amazing.  PS: It's a very bad PC port, but with a quick fix it's playable.
2807	*15/10, fun for the whole family.* This cultural phenomenon, which will come to define this generation for the next several decades, was most assuredly not inspired by the hit TV show 'Twin Peaks' and definitely does not blatantly rip off said show in a hilarious and heartwarming manner. Swery is a tortured genius, and his artistic soul -- tender and tormented -- is laid bare, raw and awesome. It would be a folly comparable to the fall of man to not partake in the seductive madness and ensnaring purity that is Deadly Premonition. If you do just one thing with your life that you can look back on with pride and say, 'I did it perfectly' when on your deathbed, let buying and playing this game be that one thing.
2808	Clear as a crisp spring morning!
2809	Great game, great story not so action packed gameplay but really nice overall if you like mistery. I liked it very much 
2810	this game is ridiculous, so many mistakes like the use of public domain monkey noises for squirells and the mutated sounding dogs, also not to mention this is a huge twin peaks rip off. 9/10
2811	A bizzare game that both saturizes modern 'horror' games and pays homage to the experemental Dreamcast titles like D and Illbleed. Despite the fact that it isn't a scary game, it's atmosphere is a suprisingly unsettling one that gets more insane and intriquing the longer you play. Despite the fact that it is just a lazy PS3 port the PC version is still the best version of this game you can buy but it's recommended you use the DP fix fan patch to fully enjoy it.
2812	Obligatory points: Deadly Premonition is 'Twin Peaks as everyone remembers it', and your gameplay experience may or may not have crash-to-desktop technical issues, depending on your hardware configuration, star sign, and quantum signature. So, here are my remaining thoughts on Deadly Premonition.  This game is weird, harmlessly so. At first, I wasn't sure whether York - the Special FBI Agent player character - was odd on purpose. or if he was some kind of space-alien wearing human skin and trying to imitate humans (like that guy in Men in Black). The first cutscene in the game has York arguing about Tom and Jerry - the cartoon cat and mouse - with a coworker, before introducing Zach. Who's addressed in the second-person.  You know the kind of game released late in the Dreamcast's lifespan? Where the developers were all 'who cares, if it fits just put it in the game and we'll figure it out later'? Nobody ever seemed to buy the game, but everyone half-remembers it anyway? Deadly Premonition was that weird game. As an example, this game tracks how long York has been wearing his suits; if you wear a single item of clothing for too long (in game time), you'll be fined money for being a 'stinky Agent' and you'll get flies buzzing around you until the suit is laundered (at cost, and which takes game time). There's also more mundane 'little things', like how you need to remember to put fuel in your car. You can complete side missions to collect trading cards. You need to remember to eat and sleep properly. There's a fishing and darts minigame, because why not?  Another thing that really endeared me to Deadly Premonition was the interplay between the cast of characters - once the investigation is underway and time passes, York can start eating lunch with the main secondary cast (the sheriff of the town and his staff). Gameplay-wise it's a way of refilling your hunger meter and passing time until a big mission is ready to be undertaken, but it's also an opportunity for York and the others to talk about the case - or just small talk. Side missions open this up even further - and as NPCs have their own schedule according to the in-game clock, they're a matter of 'catching them when they're ready', not just approaching the floating QUEST READY icon whenever.  Technical issues asside, Deadly Premonition is divisive for a reason; either you'll sink into the plain  weirdness  of the whole thing and enjoy it from start to finish, as I did, or perhaps come to enjoy it in a 'so bad it's good' kind of way - or you just won't enjoy it. The combat sections are an obvious bolt-on from a publisher uncertain if a non-man-shoot game would ever sell, the voice acting is questionable (although York nails it while discussing '80s movies with Zach on long trips), and dear God almighty York has the creepiest inhuman smile.  If you're a gigantic baby when it comes to scary games - like myself - rest assured there's little 'proper' horror (purists, sit down). Spooky monsters to mash, and a creepy, tense atmosphere during combat sections, but nothing in the way of ultraviolence or stupid jump scares and BOO soundtrack stings or whatever.  The thing is, I could never be absolutely certain which parts are standard reach-exceeds-grasp 'jank', which were Japanese translation weirdness, and which are simply weird on purpose. I enjoyed the game in spite of this and the drawbacks mentioned above, but in the end if you're looking for a polished experience you're going to be disappointed. Otherwise, install the game, install dpfix to fit the game to your display resolution, and enjoy the absolutely unique experience of Deadly Premonition. Make sure to whistle 'Life is Beautiful' wherever you go afterwards.
2813	The Twin Peaks vision David Lynch was never able to truly realize
2814	This game is amazing I would give it 100 stars if I could riveting story and real to life schizophrenia simulator.
2815	Controls - C / 4 out of 10 Graphics - C / 4 out of 10 Sound - A+ - 10 out of 10 Story - A+ - 10 out of 10  Verdict?  A++++++++++++++. 1000 out of 100  The greatest game I have ever, ever played. More deserving of the title 'Game of the Year' than any single game ever. Better than Ocarina of Time. Better than Fallout. Better than Grand Theft Auto. The true Famitsu would've given this game 280 out of 40.  Let me explain my scores up there some more. The graphics look like they belong to a game from the middle of the PS2 era, the controls are horrific. The music is amazing, but most of what makes it amazing is the timing of it. Sitting down around a table somber just after someone died? Bring on the whistling! But what truly makes this game shine, is the story and the characters. Every single character is interesting and lovable, though not always to the same person - for example I hate Raging Bull Jack, but I'm quite sure someone out there thinks Jack is hilarious.  For $24.99, this is one game you should not miss out on. So buy it, and get hype for the greatest game ever.  OK, Zach?
2816	A Diamond in the rough... just DO NOT play it on PC! Play it on console!  I first encountered this game on PC. I had heard a lot about it, and gave it a try. I wanted to like it, but the PC version is a mess. Even with the DP Fix patch, this game just isn't stable. Bugs, crashes, compatibilty fixes that randomly quit working, random framrate drops requiring reboot of PC, terrible/broken controller support, etc. It was a miracle i made it chapter 8 on PC. I tried it on 2 PCs, and on both Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 on each PC. On 7, I can't even get the game to boot - on either PC. My main PC isn't weak either, my rig is more than capable of handling the game; so that's not an issue. Last but not least : there is no hope for an official update in sight. Long ago the delvelopers heard the complaints and basically replied 'Oh, we are sorry the Dev team the did the Director's cut butchered the game, it's embarrising. We apologize' .....and left it at that. It's quite unfortunate that such a unique game fell victim to this shady practice.  ..So I picked up the Director's Cut on PS3. It runs much more stable, and was enjoyable. The reivews don't lie though: The PS3 version does suffer from a low framrate at times. Sometimes its fine, and sometimes it drops to as low as 20 FPS. But it's still playable, and I'd pick it over PC anyday, having also played the PS3 version to chapter 8 to compare.  Having decided I loved the game after playing the much more stable PS3 version, I found a mint copy of the Xbox 360 version (Original Release, not a Director's cut) for a 10 bucks, and decide to try it too. I was shocked at the difference!!! Hands down, the Xbox 360 verion of this game is the definitive version of Deadly Premonition! It runs best out of all 3 versions, and there are no framerate issues on xbox, you can really see just how badly the port was done after playing the original release.  The things people complained about in the XBox version I just can't agree with. First, people complained of the tank-like controls on the 360 - they are fine. The classic control gives the game the feel it needs, and I find to be much more sharp and responsive, better in battle after practice. The ability to side-step and do an instant 180 turn in classic controls are a must. Second, people complained about the color filters - they are great! If your TV can support XBox 360's Higher/Darker Color Reference/Black levels - the way the color is done in the original version looks brilliant. They give the environment and the character's faces the perfect flares of color right when they need them, giving the game a feel from some older horror movies. Even when the filter aren't running, like in the pause menu you will notice the color is much more vivid - making both PC and PS3 Director's cut verions look washed out. With the exception of the black/gray/white color themed HUD, the Xbox version looks better than the PC and the PS3 version in every way. And if you aren't a whiny spoiled brat, the controls are better suited too, once you learn them.  Play this game before you die; just don't play it on PC, you are just robbing yourself of a great game experience if you do. And if you have an Xbox 360 - get that version ASAP - it's getting pretty expensive. At the time of this review, a mint copy is going between $40 to $99 USD on ebay (both used and new copies are in that range). So clearly, I can't be the only one that realizes why the 360 version has become so cherished as more people discover this game...
2817	This game makes me want to peek through every single window, despite long loading times between peeking in and getting back. It makes me desperately want to finish it despite the crash that forces you to play it in windowed mode. Its town feels alive, with real inhabitants, despite their quirky animations and weirdnesses.  I get lost driving with those horrible cars that veer right, and laugh to myself at the uselessly zoomed in map. And still, everything intruiges me to such a degree that I would call this a once-in-a-lifetime experience that I would never want to be withouth.  There is so much to do and see, that I found myself fainting outside of an ingame diner and woke up after being driven to the hospital. Surprised I realised I had let my loveable strange FBI agent go too long withouth eating. Similiarly I noticed flies started gathering around me at one point, because I had not changed clothes and sent my worn ones to get washed. I'm growing a beard as the game progresses, as I have not choosen to shave.   The story is full of twists and turns. Every character IS a character, with motivations, secrets, a backstory... They all seem to have lived their lives up to the point you join them in the game. The side quests, silly as they may be, seem to fit in the world. Seldom does one come across a game that can make the gamer so immersed, it has the ability to frighten, make one laugh out loud, as well as puzzle and feel sad.  Cult classic: The mystery, the music, the ugliness, the beauty, the people, the humour, the dialouge... This Japanese tribute to Twin Peaks and movie trivia is beyond words. With all it's flaws, it's simply genius.
2818	Litterally the best game ever.
2819	Great game, great story not so action packed gameplay but really nice overall if you like mistery. I liked it very much 
2820	Really weird, but ultimately really good. Once you get over the quirks, it turns out to be a really solid game.
2821	this game has a great horror story with good gameplay i love the voice acting  this game has its creepy moments and it has its LOL moments  if you want a good horror / crime needs to be solved type of good then look no farther this game is amazing. 85 / 100
2822	Deadly Premonition is the single greatest mystery adventure game of all time.  That may be a hyperbole statement, but I assure you this is not an exaggeration and I will tell you why you shouldnât miss out on one of the most uniquely produced games that may never be replicated.  In Deadly Premonition you play as special FBI agent Francis York Morgan (just call him York, everyone calls him that) who has an imaginary friend named Zach, gets paid for shaving his beard, viewing the weather channel and gets advice from his coffee. York goes to Greenvale, a small town where a murder has taken place against a woman named Anna Graham, and itâs up to York, as well as the Sheriff: George woodman and Deputy Sheriff Emily Wyatt to solve the townâs biggest case yet.  Once you're past the intro cutscene, you may think that Deadly Premonition is just a survival horror game that takes cues from other survival horror games such as Silent Hill. However once you complete the prologue thinks get much stranger, weirder and funnier.  The game features dialogue that is both bizarre and completely hilarious usually at the same time, and undermines the games more serious scenes with some of the most amusingly inappropriate music they could think of. For example when York witnesses a murder take place, he will be accompanied by smooth jazz while he makes witty remarks, usually in the same room of the victim. When having lunch York will tell tasteless anecdotes about his past cases, one being where âan ingenious law school student â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ over 800 victimsâ to the people sitting nearby him. Just when you think youâve seen the strangest part of the game, something stranger pops up not long after.  Deadly Premonition is not only a mystery and survival horror game, itâs also an open world game where you can find collectibles, do side missions, explore the surprisingly large world and do some quests that require shooting zombie like enemies. The driving is hilariously bad and York takes his time to enter and exit the vehicle, however itâs worth it just to hear York talk to Zach about movie trivia and thoughts on the case.  Some submissions can only be tackled during certain times of the day, and usually consists of fetch quests. However doing side missions can net you some goodies, such as a fast travel radio, a submachine gun with infinite ammunition, and trading cards that you can collect.  When youâre not driving around, collecting collectables or talking to the locals, youâll be doing one of the many shooting sequences of the game that play out a bit like Resident Evil 4. That being said, the combat is very simple and doesnât get difficult until halfway through the game, despite this these action sequences can be fun as you build up an arsenal of weapons that include pistols, shotguns and machine guns. While youâre shooting enemies you may encounter the âRaincoat Killerâ who is the mysterious culprit you are after, upon encountering you will either have to do a QuickTime event, run away, or hide in a locker to make sure he doesnât find you. Even though these sequences are predictable, they can be a good change of pace.  I think I should also mention the graphics; they wonât impress anybody and this was meant to be a Playstation 2 game at one point in development, however the poorly done animations are very comical and had me dying of laughter at points. The sounds are sometimes equally as bad; guns sound like pea shooters and use stock sound effects sometimes and the voice acting is the best kind of bad.  Despite having atrocious graphics, poor sound and simple Gameplay, the game manages to do the whole âso bad itâs goodâ tactic perfectly.  Itâs nearly impossible for me to describe some of the more bizarre moments of deadly premonition, but because of the low budget looks and bizarreness of the storyline, Deadly Premonition is one of the most uniquely crafted games I have ever played.  The game excels at providing one of the most bizarre, confusing and entertaining narratives in a computer game, itâs like watching a beautiful train wreck happening on your computer screen, and depending on how you feel, you may even feel a bit emotional at the end of the game, I know I did.  After completing Deadly Premonition, I was sad, very sad, because the main storyline was deemed complete; no game has ever made me laugh so hard to the point of tears more than Deadly Premonition, and it is worth every penny for its comical value.  However I think itâs now time to bring up an issue that plagues the pc port, and that is that it is a poor port that suffers from crashing, fixed resolution and lack of graphical options. If you are going to buy Deadly Premonition, buy it on a console, if you donât have a console, purchase it on PC and download a few mods to fix the issues.  If youâre curious what Deadly Premonition is ultimately like, Jim Sterling said it best: âDeadly Premonition is like watching two clowns eat each other. Itâs perverse, itâs wrong, and yet itâs so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing funny.â  There is no other title in the gaming industry that matches the sheer hilarity and bizarreness as Deadly Premonition.  The game is not only so bad itâs good; itâs so bad its borderline perfection!
2823	Terrible but also good.
2824	The terrible gameplay actually makes the game better as a narrative and aesthetic experience, trust me.
2825	its got a great story  its got nothing else good about it at all
2826	Deadly premonition's port to PC is A real hot mess, even with the DPfix for 1080p and controller support is not enough. You still experience massive fps drops do to compatibility issues that can only be resolved by uninstalling most of your media players or changing the codex!  Well... Aside from all that it's really a great game, but only consider buying it on sale. Truly a flawed gem...
2827	A True Detective [Twin Peaks] of gaming. Twisted plot. Cult following. Very Swery.
2828	Remember the cult 90's show Twin Peaks? Fantastic series, and this game holds up well as 'companion media' to the show. You are put in the role of Francis York Morgan, an FBI Special Agent who is dispatched to the small country town of Greenvale to work on a homicide case. As the game progresses York becomes involved in the town's sinister affairs and realises that things are not as they seem.  The game plays a lot like an actual investigation. You will go to gather evidence, interrogate suspects and follow leads. The game world is open to you with no time limit, so there's nothing stopping you from enjoying what Greenvale has to offer!  The game's story is its true strength. The characters, locations and subplots adds to everything that makes the game 'so bad it's good'. A terrific game to play if you're interested in Twin Peaks or The X-Files.
2829	As much as it's ugly, clumsy, buggy, dated technologically and features some dull combat sequences that belong to much older PS2 games, none of its flaws are at all worth avoiding it for. Deadly Premonition features some of the best characters in gaming in the last 15 years, some fantastic and funny dialogue, a moving story, and some of the weirdest atmosphere you'll ever see. Where it fails, it somehow only enhances the experience. And where it succeeds it soars. It's completely and utterl one o fa kind and every gamer should play it on any platform they can find it on, because there's just nothing else like it. When your time comes to a close, you will so deeply miss York, Zach, Emily, Greenvale, and every looney in it.
2830	I played this game years ago, and to this day if someone asked me to name the craziest game I've ever played, or the most annoying game, or most surprising game, OR even one of the best games E-VER - you guessed it. This one right here.   I've always been a survival horror fan, so it was pretty natural for me to pick this up on the 360 back then. I did not quite get what I was expecting. Deadly Premonition is Twin Peaks meets Silent Hill with many other influences thrown in and brewed into a cup of joe that, well, might be best left to interpretation. The game is not perfect. It's awkward at times, annoying at others, sometimes makes no sense and sometimes makes ALL the sense! (yeah) But in the end, I don't think I've forgotten a single thing about it. That is how it stuck with me.  I admit, at times I sincerely hated this game and thought it was the worse piece of crap ever thrown together - a game that tried to be everything and yet couldn't find its place in a proper, comfortable gaming category. I ranted and raved about it to anyone who would listen - but this game was always on my mind. Did I stop playing? No. I HAD to keep going! And I did.   I remember the day I finally finished it. I told myself 'I will beat this game tonight! I will finish it and then I will never have to touch it again!!!' I believed it was doable. I thought I was near the end... And so I played. And played. And just when I thought it would be over... I was mentally exhausted but I couldn't stop! By the time I reached the end it was at least 3 in the morning, and I just sank down in my chair and looked at the screen to see the credits roll by. But even then I was still thinking about it.  It was a gaming experience I have never forgotten. And now I'm ready to do it again!  Thank you, Deadly Premonition, for scaring me and driving me crazy (and also thank you for letting me figure out who the killer was a little ahead of time because of my own clue hunting effort. That was rewarding). And thanks for keeping me awake and for completely exhausting me with your twisty plotline. For that, you earn a special place on my lifetime gaming list.
2831	how did this game got a 58 on Metacritic?, aside from having to had to use DPfix, its an amazing experience just finished the prologue and the first fortune telling, and i can already feel all the potential of this game, controls are not the best but York, the coffe and even the old lady are all amazing, the voice acting ists so weird it even makes the game better, it may not be for all but for me its a 10/10 already i will update as soon as i advance more in the game.
2832	I knew this game was goig to be something else, my Coffe said so
2833	Very good game, wish there were a 2nd.
2834	Play Twin Peaks the game as imagined by an insanely quirky Japanese design team- wonderful charm despite the overt violence.
2835	Maybe we should send the ones who are responsible for this console port to the great city of Harvest. Steve the old kidder with his stupid â¥â¥â¥ lumberjack shirt will accompany their trip for a night and if they come back Deadly Premonition will become the new Harvest and Twin Peaks in one. Ergo: The best â¥â¥â¥â¥ing town/game ever.   Long story short: Buy this game, its awesome. Torture the ones who made this port. They deserve it.
2836	Buy this damn game.
2837	'This is the Best thing ever!' - Giant Bomb 'This is the Worst thing ever.' - Giant Bomb
2838	This is a game that allows you to say, 'One of the crappiest video games ever made' and 'One of the greatest video games ever made' and have both be true.
2839	What has often been referred to as one of the 'best-worst' games of all time. Deadly Premonition is a Twin Peaks homage that similarly involves an eccentric FBI agent (Francis York Morgan) as he's called in to investigate a terrible murder in the small, rural community of Greenvale.  The game takes the player along for a ride with Special Agent York (please, call him York, it's what everyone calls him' and the friend only he can acknowledge; Zach, as together they question the locals, look for evidence, buy crackers for $44 and... shave?  Balancing open-world driving and walking, side-quests, gunplay, humour and emotion is a tough task. The gunplay is poor (although improved over the Xbox version), the car (especially the initial one) handles poorly and the game has a habit of using inappropriately 'wacky' music for serious situations... so believe me when I say that a game would have to really pull a cat out of the bag to overcome those, question is, does Deadly Premonition?  Yes, yes it does. Memorable and endearing characters with distinct personalities and interactions that keep you half rooted to your seat and half mind-fuzzled with a big stupid grin on your face, a creative and emotionally-driven story that's entirely unlike anything (bar Twin Peaks) that I've seen anywhere else.  York and Zach in particular deserve special mention for being particularly great, from their serious 'discussions' about the case, to the smaller, random car conversations about DVD special features and 'Jaws' amongst other things. On the flip-side, the Raincoat Killer is a fantastic antagonist, steeped in mystery both magical and mundane that'll make you -really- want to know who's hiding under that hood.  Deadly Premonition has it's problems, but it compensates in so many other ways beyond that, that it's easily within my top 5 games of all time. There's nothing else like it and fans of detective stories (Twin Peaks fans in particular) are doing themselves a disservice not giving it a go!  Edit: Forgot to mention, the game is roughly between 15-20 hours long depending how sidequest happy you are. Not a bad mileage for a cheap, low-budget game.
2840	Amazing game! With the disappointing turn the Resident Evil franchise took with 6 and ORC (though saved by Revelations) I have been on the lookout for any 3P Survival Horror that is actually entertaining. While this is no RE4, it's a fantastic game along those same lines. If you're a fan of 3PSurvival Horror games such as Resident Evil 1-5/Revelations, you must try this one.
2841	Great atmospheric game. Word of advice: do not rush thorugh game. Explore as much as possbile.
2842	Worth it just for the ending.
2843	Clunky combat, weird out of place humor, goofy main character, and self aware side characters. Mix this up with fairly bad performance, terrible terrible driving physics, hard crashes, and what do you get?  A game that ends up being good despite the flaws. Pick it up today!
2844	Obligatory points: Deadly Premonition is 'Twin Peaks as everyone remembers it', and your gameplay experience may or may not have crash-to-desktop technical issues, depending on your hardware configuration, star sign, and quantum signature. So, here are my remaining thoughts on Deadly Premonition.  This game is weird, harmlessly so. At first, I wasn't sure whether York - the Special FBI Agent player character - was odd on purpose. or if he was some kind of space-alien wearing human skin and trying to imitate humans (like that guy in Men in Black). The first cutscene in the game has York arguing about Tom and Jerry - the cartoon cat and mouse - with a coworker, before introducing Zach. Who's addressed in the second-person.  You know the kind of game released late in the Dreamcast's lifespan? Where the developers were all 'who cares, if it fits just put it in the game and we'll figure it out later'? Nobody ever seemed to buy the game, but everyone half-remembers it anyway? Deadly Premonition was that weird game. As an example, this game tracks how long York has been wearing his suits; if you wear a single item of clothing for too long (in game time), you'll be fined money for being a 'stinky Agent' and you'll get flies buzzing around you until the suit is laundered (at cost, and which takes game time). There's also more mundane 'little things', like how you need to remember to put fuel in your car. You can complete side missions to collect trading cards. You need to remember to eat and sleep properly. There's a fishing and darts minigame, because why not?  Another thing that really endeared me to Deadly Premonition was the interplay between the cast of characters - once the investigation is underway and time passes, York can start eating lunch with the main secondary cast (the sheriff of the town and his staff). Gameplay-wise it's a way of refilling your hunger meter and passing time until a big mission is ready to be undertaken, but it's also an opportunity for York and the others to talk about the case - or just small talk. Side missions open this up even further - and as NPCs have their own schedule according to the in-game clock, they're a matter of 'catching them when they're ready', not just approaching the floating QUEST READY icon whenever.  Technical issues asside, Deadly Premonition is divisive for a reason; either you'll sink into the plain  weirdness  of the whole thing and enjoy it from start to finish, as I did, or perhaps come to enjoy it in a 'so bad it's good' kind of way - or you just won't enjoy it. The combat sections are an obvious bolt-on from a publisher uncertain if a non-man-shoot game would ever sell, the voice acting is questionable (although York nails it while discussing '80s movies with Zach on long trips), and dear God almighty York has the creepiest inhuman smile.  If you're a gigantic baby when it comes to scary games - like myself - rest assured there's little 'proper' horror (purists, sit down). Spooky monsters to mash, and a creepy, tense atmosphere during combat sections, but nothing in the way of ultraviolence or stupid jump scares and BOO soundtrack stings or whatever.  The thing is, I could never be absolutely certain which parts are standard reach-exceeds-grasp 'jank', which were Japanese translation weirdness, and which are simply weird on purpose. I enjoyed the game in spite of this and the drawbacks mentioned above, but in the end if you're looking for a polished experience you're going to be disappointed. Otherwise, install the game, install dpfix to fit the game to your display resolution, and enjoy the absolutely unique experience of Deadly Premonition. Make sure to whistle 'Life is Beautiful' wherever you go afterwards.
2845	Deadly Premonition is what you'd get if you asked Suda 51 to direct the new Silent Hill game, as opposed to giving to â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Hideo Kojima of all people. Everyone seems like they're on drugs, the dialogue is janky and awkward, everything is strange and weird. It does add a really nice atmosphere, the deluded sense that something is terrible and wrong but no one else really seems to notice. I mean, more than just a crazy serial killer. Francis York Morgan is a pretty good protagonist, his David Duchovny FBI cool makes him a likable guy and although he as well seems to be on a variety of drugs, he is the most rational and enjoyable to be with. It's one of the best horror games on steam, save for Amnesia and Condemned and is totally worth buying.
2846	Mysterious capitalists and cross dressers; whats not to love
2847	Best worst game ever made. Level design is terrible. Driving mechanics are horrific. Camera is annoying as anything to control. Will continue playing and probably play over again at least twice. 10/10
2848	Deadly Premonition is a good game but good god this is a terrible port. It took a frankly embarrasing amount of fiddling with fan-made patches and with the games files to get it working and even then it's seems to be running slow. I liked this game a lot on Xbox but I can't recommend it on steam at all.
2849	I would keep it short.  PC port is terrible, interface is a bit annoying at times, incredibly odd and strange driving, constant crashes and FPS drops.  But it still one of the best games I've played. Intriguing story, charismatic characters and dence atmosphere is what makes the game this great.  About technical part of the game. The following quotes says it all: 'I would drag my balls through 10 miles of broken glass just to play another 20 mins of this game's story. ' Steam user jerry.   If you are willing to fight the glitches and crashes, you would experience everything that makes this game so great.
2850	Deadly Premonition is what Resident Evil and Silent Hill would be like if they had a lot more social awkwardness, imaginary friends, and talk of real life 80's movies. Also, it has music from Super Mario World. For $25, your sides will hurt more than your wallet..   Also there's F.K. In the Coffee.
2851	a diamond in a dog â¥â¥â¥â¥.  What do you think, Zach?  10 out of 10 coffees
2852	this game is so japanese it hurts
2853	Opened a fridge and found a trading card of a turkey sandwich. ... 11/10
2854	This game is, sure, weird. But nice. It's nicely weird. And weirdly nice. As the console port it has a lot of bugs and glitches, it has it's undeniable flaws and till the very end it's impossible to decide if it's serious game or is it some kind of a parody. It's also impossible to stop playing, to stop enjoying the characters and the story that is weird... but nice. That is why I love japanese games so much - they can be weird, but they would leave nice aftertaste. For sure.
2855	The best detective game ever. You get to talk to yourself and chase potential suspects around in their daily lives like follow them to the club or grocery store. Be prepared this game is so good you will talk to yourself and develop a close alter ego.
2856	This game is funny. But absolutly not worth $25.00. So either get it on G ... 2 ... A .com (Sorry for the weird link, steam wont let me write the website). were it is 2 bucks or get it on sale for under 5.
2857	I LOVE THE GAME.... But the downside is the PC Port the sound quality and the effects are horrible especially 5.1 but overall it's a cult classic it's a beautiful game,there's something about this game that just simply reminds me of Sega I just can't put a pin on it but I know it's something nostalgic but with that being said the storyline is so rich it draws you in and just how corny the jokes are....to put it simply just reminds me of an old-school corny detective movie do I recommend the game?, yes but buy it when it's on sale... like i did for 3 bucks
2858	A Diamond in the rough... just DO NOT play it on PC! Play it on console!  I first encountered this game on PC. I had heard a lot about it, and gave it a try. I wanted to like it, but the PC version is a mess. Even with the DP Fix patch, this game just isn't stable. Bugs, crashes, compatibilty fixes that randomly quit working, random framrate drops requiring reboot of PC, terrible/broken controller support, etc. It was a miracle i made it chapter 8 on PC. I tried it on 2 PCs, and on both Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 on each PC. On 7, I can't even get the game to boot - on either PC. My main PC isn't weak either, my rig is more than capable of handling the game; so that's not an issue. Last but not least : there is no hope for an official update in sight. Long ago the delvelopers heard the complaints and basically replied 'Oh, we are sorry the Dev team the did the Director's cut butchered the game, it's embarrising. We apologize' .....and left it at that. It's quite unfortunate that such a unique game fell victim to this shady practice.  ..So I picked up the Director's Cut on PS3. It runs much more stable, and was enjoyable. The reivews don't lie though: The PS3 version does suffer from a low framrate at times. Sometimes its fine, and sometimes it drops to as low as 20 FPS. But it's still playable, and I'd pick it over PC anyday, having also played the PS3 version to chapter 8 to compare.  Having decided I loved the game after playing the much more stable PS3 version, I found a mint copy of the Xbox 360 version (Original Release, not a Director's cut) for a 10 bucks, and decide to try it too. I was shocked at the difference!!! Hands down, the Xbox 360 verion of this game is the definitive version of Deadly Premonition! It runs best out of all 3 versions, and there are no framerate issues on xbox, you can really see just how badly the port was done after playing the original release.  The things people complained about in the XBox version I just can't agree with. First, people complained of the tank-like controls on the 360 - they are fine. The classic control gives the game the feel it needs, and I find to be much more sharp and responsive, better in battle after practice. The ability to side-step and do an instant 180 turn in classic controls are a must. Second, people complained about the color filters - they are great! If your TV can support XBox 360's Higher/Darker Color Reference/Black levels - the way the color is done in the original version looks brilliant. They give the environment and the character's faces the perfect flares of color right when they need them, giving the game a feel from some older horror movies. Even when the filter aren't running, like in the pause menu you will notice the color is much more vivid - making both PC and PS3 Director's cut verions look washed out. With the exception of the black/gray/white color themed HUD, the Xbox version looks better than the PC and the PS3 version in every way. And if you aren't a whiny spoiled brat, the controls are better suited too, once you learn them.  Play this game before you die; just don't play it on PC, you are just robbing yourself of a great game experience if you do. And if you have an Xbox 360 - get that version ASAP - it's getting pretty expensive. At the time of this review, a mint copy is going between $40 to $99 USD on ebay (both used and new copies are in that range). So clearly, I can't be the only one that realizes why the 360 version has become so cherished as more people discover this game...
2859	As I kept playing, I've come to love this game's bulls***t. There's so much to like about it that I found myself ignoring a lot of errors and problems with the game. So, as a video game, this is actually a bad one. But as someone's vision, as a project, it's some kind of amazing.  PS: It's a very bad PC port, but with a quick fix it's playable.
2860	This game is amazing I would give it 100 stars if I could riveting story and real to life schizophrenia simulator.
2861	Let me begin by pointing out that this is a terrible PC port. One of the worst I've seen for sure. That said, I was able to comfortably play the game to completion using a mod called DPfix. Not only did this make the game playable, but it also allowed the game to run at a very stable framerate and added support for multiple resolutions. This is important to note because the only other version of this game's Director's Cut available here in the West, namely the PS3 port, suffers from abyssmal performance. With this in mind, the PC version of Deadly Premonition is somehow both the best and worst version of the game. On a personal note, I find this a bit poetic because it perfectly reflects the spirit of the game.  TL;DR The PC port is crap but there's an easy fix that allows for better performance than its console counterparts. For that reason, I can't help but recommend this version over the others.   With that introduction out of the way, let's talk about Deadly Premonition. In short, it's every bit as good, bad, and weird as you've heard. It's an anomoly of a game that really makes you question everything you think you know about what makes a game 'good' or 'bad.' It's completely lacking in polish, yet is so striking in its presentation that it's almost impossible to take your eyes off of it. It casts the broadest net possible over as many genres as it can cover, yet consistently fails to function fully as any one of them independently. It's the only game where you can drive a sports car on two wheels, at 80 miles per hour, to the home of a reclusive gas-mask wearing paraplegic who speaks only in rhyme through his manservant, as weird trance techno blares over the radio, all while your character has a conversation with his imaginary friend about the death of Joey Ramone.  There's nothing I can say that will adequately convey the experience of playing Deadly Premonition, so I won't try any further than I already have. Play it and see for yourself.

2863	It's so bad, I love it.

2865	The terrible gameplay actually makes the game better as a narrative and aesthetic experience, trust me.
2866	Possibly the only game where I feel the need to watch every movie mentioned by a single character.  
2867	Zach needs COFFEE! 8/10 3$ game. Totally worth 3$! If you like horror games then you might enjoy this. Oh and you can shave your face.  People say this is a bad port and it crashes. I haven't had one crash yet. Maybe a sugar crash but thats about it.  Beware this game has alot of cut scenes!    
2868	I played this to completion on 360. When I first ran this on PC, I did get a crash at startup, but this was fixed by setting to WinXPSP3 mode and running as administrator on both the launcher and dp.exe. Please keep in mind it might be a hard game to get going, since it's a lazy port. BUT THE GAME IS AWESOME This is probably one of the best games I've ever played. The characters and story are so weird that you'll keep laughing and keep trudging through the game just so you can find what happens next. There is no other game like this game. Yes the graphics are bad and the game controls pretty poorly, but if you can make it past those things, you have an unforgettable cast of characters and amazing plot to keep you playing into the wee hours of the night. I recommend that everyone try this game for at least two hours. If the graphics are too bad for you, grab the dpfix which is listed in the forums. I hope you enjoy the game as much as I did.
2869	This game aint for everyone, the shooting is clunky and easy, the camera can be annoying at times, the game crashes (and needs to be played as Admin, if you want to get past the part) and the graphics look worse then an early Xbox 360/PS3 game. That all said, the game is amazing. The story, the characters and the dialog make the game what it is. Its a special kinda game that cant really be said why its so great, you have to play it yourself. 10/10 we need more games like this.
2870	It's like Skyrim with a cup of coffee.
2871	This game is so bad that it is good. Just buy it for the most akward experience ever on PC ever. Just buy it.  
2872	What IS this game even
2873	I usually like to go in depth with my 'reviews' but...I just...this game. If you like Twin Peaks and you like Resident Evil style gameplay, give this a try. It's deceptively good despite the incredibly low budget. Also get DPfix because the port is â¥â¥â¥â¥.
2874	After living through the best 42 minutes of my fledging adult life I've come to the realization that I've ecountered the best single experience one can dream of.  Within this nearly 3/4 of an hour of bliss I've witnessed grotesque horrors beyond my mind's capabilities, dialogue AND monologue worthy competing of Shakespeare's best soliloquys. The life like animation engaged me on not only an emotional level but that of a spiritual one as well. The picturesque enviroment had me on the verge of tears in terms of sheer beauty; the amount of love the developers put into making every drop of water in the lakes and every leaf on the trees shows their commitment to the art that is VIDEO GAMES. The subtle yet numerous pop culture references to movies and films also shows how up to date and hip this studio is. The sound quality and level of fidelity to it is in of itself amazing, the character's voice actors really engage each other with passion for the roles they play.   In short this game is the Citizen Kane of Schindler's Lists' and is truly deserving of being called art. if it was any more perfect I'd need to check myself for testicular cancer. I can't enjoy anything else now, this was the top and it'll be downhill from here on out.  9/11 it was an inside job worth making.
2875	Who says 'its two hundred' when you want to say its 20:00 c'lock... thats how unique this game is..
2876	Wow.... This game is really REALLY AMAZING... I recommend it ! 100%!  -Please use the DPfix (lastest release) **Dont overdo with the graphical options or it will crash ALOT** -ALWAYS run it as Administrator!  It never crashed on me  10/10! I love it! 
2877	This game looks like crap, plays like crap, craps out a lot, lots of crappy glitches, and yet is one of the best pieces of crap I've ever played. Just expect a lot of weirdness in this crap. I recommend only for its story.
2878	(6.5/10) [65%]  Strange game, Captivating. (8/10) @first, then levels out. You need to endure, but it is engaging.

2879	Yo this game is weird, I love it
2880	This port is worse than 9/11.
2881	This game is likely one of my favorites that I have played within the last couple of years. There are many flaws in the game engine which vary from person to person, but the game was good enough for me to want to push past them. Once I got into the game a bit, terrible things like frame-rate drops stopped happening, and the main bugs were just the physics engine.  As a safety note, as with anything, BACK UP YOUR SAVES. I never had any problem, but many people complain of losing progress or having things disappear after having collected them, so keep backups.  Onto the game elements...  + Awesome story. It is a bit weird and out there as you get further into the game, but it kept me intrigued the whole way. I love games like Silent Hill, but even if you don't like those, try the game. It's not as crazily demonic as those. A very interesting mystery to keep you guessing.  + The graphics were still pretty good, except for the glitches. I liked the style.  + The voice acting was pretty well-done, and I liked most of the characters overall. They had their own interesting pieces to them (oh man, that Cold Pot lady).  - The gameplay, altogether, is actually a letdown, though wanting to see the town and the story held everything together for me. Most of the fighting 'monsters' was rather pointless and unnecessary, and just got boring after a while. It makes sense for things like Silent Hill and Resident Evil, and it's usually done in a way where it's not too boring or you can escape if necessary. Here, the fighting is just boring, one-by-one, often forcing you to empty rooms before you can move on.  I still think that the game altogether was great, just getting past the glitches took a while. If you are looking for an off-the-wall, but really interesting, action/drama game, just look into this one.

2883	Probably one the most abysmal PC ports ever made (even worse than the Dark Souls port), although it varies between PC's in how it performs. First half of the game gave me random crashes, second half would slow down gradually the more new areas I loaded into.  But this game is amazing. It's amazing amazing. You must remember or heard of Destructoid's Jim Sterling giving it a perfect 10/10? Yeah, I don't like him either, but now that I have gone back and read his review, it makes perfect sense. Also, if you love Twin Peaks, you can't help but fall in love with this game either. Not only does Deadly Premonition have an excellent soundtrack, story, and characters that just feel so real, natural and quirky, but it doesn't forget itself as being extremely videogamey in every sense of the word or feeling, however you want to interpret that. The only cons I can think of would be the possible issues (or no issues) you might have with the port, the game looking like it released late Xbox generation, and mediocre filler shooting sections.
2884	Hi! My name is David Lynch and I approve this game.
2885	Yo this game is weird, I love it
2886	I made this short because people should know about this game. The story is amazing... it is probably one of the best game I have ever played. The only problem is that the port is terrible but if you ok to deal with it. You will not regret it at all... the story will make you play all the way to the end.
2887	It's so good, the chipmunks make monkey noises.  What's even better is, you can even turn the graphics up to... Oh wait. Nevermind.   IGN RATES: 10/10  
2888	Never before have I experienced such an awful, weird but utterly amazing game. This game really is so bad, itâs good.
2889	Essentially the Twin Peaks video game, but I'm sure not complaining. Deadly Premonition is a stylish and unique gaming experience, and definitely worth its status as a cult game. My only complaint is the fixed graphic setting and the limited number of control/performance tweaks in-game (settings can only really be adjusted in the launcher), but otherwise a must play.
2890	If you take the characters, setting, and 90% of the story of Twin Peaks and mix it with Silent Hill-style controls and gameplay, this would be the result. I had a friend who described it as 'Japan trying to make an American game', and he is absolutely right. The voice acting is wonderfully bad and rarely matches the animation (which is a trip in itself), the story is very convoluted, messy, and each NPC seems to have an entire detailed backstory (not necessarily a bad thing), the color pallet flips from blood-and-rust to pastel-everything, controls are clunky and tasks like shooting or driving become a chore, and this game holds the record for the most inappropriate use of 'Amazing Grace' in history.  If so much is wrong with it, why do I love this game so much? Deadly Premonition is an EXPERIENCE. Its shortcomings make it all the more charming. The poorly-timed voice acting results in random one-liners that should not be funny. The story, while almost too big for one game, is rather enjoyable and the character's timelines intersect in interesting ways. Plus, nothing beats charging headfirst through hospital hallway doors because it's quicker than opening them normally.  As much as I can try, Deadly Premonition is too much to describe in one review. You're either going to love it or hate it. There is no in-between.
2891	it's something else...
2892	Don't buy this game if you like coffe and smoke cigarettes! It may triple your consumption!  Oh wait..it's on sale! You save 22 bucks! That's enough to compansate!  Buy it!  Now!  Enough said!  Need a coffe and cigarette now!  Zach is back!
2893	This is NOT a full review of a game, just a post about my personal experience getting this game to run. I have not encountered a single glitch, crash, hiccup or failure to launch while playing this, and I will post my specs below so others can compare. If you have similar specs, I wouldn't expect this game to be difficult for you to launch. Plus its $2.49 on Humble bundle right now.  -Intel core i7-6700HQ @ 2.6GHz -Windows 10 with most recent updates (AE) -Nvidia GeForce 960M -16GB RAM
2894	This is a game where the villains definitely need a hug Zach.  OK, now I've played through the whole game and it's the first game I've 100% completed. I love this game, I didn't want it to end. It's a good game and that comes despite it's inherent jankiness. Lets face it, the graphics are terrible, the combat is repetitive and boring and it crashes far too often. But those aren't what's important in this game. What's important and what makes this a good game is the story, the setting and the characters.  York is one of the most interesting game characters I've played. He's a pleasure to get to know as the game peels back layers of his personality and you come to genuinely care for him. The town, Greenvale, feels more alive than many game towns. It's full of personalities that while they may be one note quirks, are interesting and often have a reason or a story behind their quirk. I recommend you do the side quests which uncover these stories.  The game makes you care about it's characters and that makes the story have impact. I won't spoil the story because you need to play it yourself. Play this game, there is no other like it and that's the best good thing about it.
2895	This game is absolutely delicious for those with a taste for weird stuff. The PC port is best described as 'playable.' That is, after installing DPfix. It also allows one to make it much prettier than the original. Pro tip: if something isn't working, reboot. For some reason this game likes when you reboot.
2896	If there was a reward for Controls Worse than a Car with â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ for Wheels, then this game would have a shelf dedicated to it. Seriously invest in a controller for this game. The game at its base is bad. Like, really bad. There's a major issue with the game that prevents it from even launching 90% of the time and the game is stuck in a windowed view with no way to change it. There aren't even any graphical settings that you can change.  That aside, the game is still enjoyable. It's one of those gems that's so bad it's good.  Also, here's a link to a mod that lets you change the graphical settings, window view bs, and fix most if not all launch failure issues:  http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?p=438 
2897	Turn signals and windshield wipers make this game a more realistic driving simulator than forza motorsport or grand turismo. Solid 5/7
2898	Love every aspect of it
2899	 Mean Mr. Mustard's short Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut review     1) Essential - buy it NOW
2900	This game. Holy â¥â¥â¥â¥. It's just like one of my mystery Chinese visual novels, except in America.  i cant click the yes button enough
2901	The combat is atrocious, but the story is extremely entertaining, and is very easy to get immersed in. Enjoy your visit to Greenvale! Take your time and don't rush through the story!
2902	An amazing game, one the best of the last generation, and also one of my favorite games of all time even though it doesn't shine technically. The graphics aren't very good, the controls are clunky but the atmosphere, setting and characters are outstanding and make the purchase really worth it. Another thing I'd like to add is that the game really benefits from a PC port, the graphics don't magically turn perfect but they are better on PC. Also a stable framerate is a gift of god.
2903	Mr. Francis York Morgan  Deadly Premonition is GOTY for sure If you're tired of boredom then here is the cure If you don't believe me just buy it and see Now you can play it on your PC  So says Mr Stewart.
2904	I've loved the style of the game ever since I saw a playthrough for it. Even being spoiled for the game, the quirky and weird storyline is wonderful. The insight into characters, the odd sidebar comments from the main character, the side quests, and more, were a sure-in for me in terms of whether I should buy this. I'm a sucker for the odd, dark, weird, and gortesque so your mileage may vary in terms of how you may enjoy the story.  A few things to note in terms of game play and PC port issues that I've read about before purchasing:  I seem to have won the Russian Roulette of PC port issues. The game has only crashed on me twice so far and both times was because I didn't save for too long. On that note, I don't have the unofficial patch installed. As for the screen revolution issue, I bought the game after the official patch (v1.01b) came out, so I didn't encounter the 720p issue. It's sizable and both full screen and windowed mode works well on my 1366 x 768 screen. (The only downside is you can't change the resolution. Only tab between full screen or windowed.) If I play it on windowed mode, I have to autohide my windows taskbar for it to fit. That's about it.  Some gameplay advise (with minor gameplay spoilers) starts here. If you're the kind who likes to do sidequests and get all the side achievements or like to explore, read on! Because I had to restart the whole game because of this issue.  There are a few short story-only chapters where you can run around the game area and accomplish tasks. However, the game doesn't tell you this. You can progress through the whole story without completing the side quests at all. But if you do like to do side quests, it's best that you find a good non-spoiler walkthrough that'll tell you when and where to do what. The game has a replay function but the downside to replaying a chapter is you CANNOT save at all during the replay; with the game's tendency without notice as well as the very specific conditions you need for side quests, it can be a huge bummer.   I found this out at chapter 4 and decided to restart the whole game so I can have the chance to save between side missions. That's about it from me so far. I love the game overall and I'm just very happy to get to play it on a platform I own.
2905	Pure B-Movie in game form. It is amazing.  If you happen to make it through to the end of the game you find a plot that is seriously messed up. No healthy mind could have thought of something this twisted. You need this game.  As a small side note, this is a straight port so there are no PC options. That means you are locked at 1280x720 and for some insane reason there is no controller support at all. Luckily the genius behind the Dark Souls Graphic Fix, Durante, is on the job once again. Here's hoping he can get controller support in there too... Of course, with resolutions higher than 1280x720 you will probably need whole new textures for a few in-game items but I think we could see that from a modder in the near future.
2906	Don't buy until it's fixed...
2907	Bad console port game with some crash problems. But crazy plot and funny dialogues makes this game weird enough to get interested. Also, Twin Peaks references.
2908	Take that game without hesitation if you like apocalyptic games. It is funny because it is weird so it makes me laugh with the random musics. The graphic details does not affect the pleasure to play. The charm of that game is the richest content gameplay wich it allows a good longevity
2909	This game is a good example of high concept not being matched by execution. There's a fix out there for the resolution issues, but nothing can save you from the crashes. If this game were a bit more polished, it would seriously be the greatest game of all time. As it stands, it's a flawed gem.  Buy it. Play it. Imagine a world in which it functioned better.
2910	WHAT THE HELL IS MY LIFE  This game is incredibly stupid  Seriously, in retrospect it's horrible  It begins with lots of laughs but the last three or so hours are insane  Yeah go play it or something
2911	The production values are last gen, the dialouge is goofy and awkward, the voice acting flip flops between lazy and hammy as hell, and yet...well, somewhere around the second hour this game transformed from a seemingly 'me too!' survival horror game to one of the most engrossing open world titles I've ever played. It's been a said a million times, but there seriously isn't anything else like it this gen, and it's more than worth plowing through, if for it's lead character (who is one of the most bizarre and awkward video game protagonists I've ever seen) and it's, despite all odds, more often than not intriguing murder mystery.
2912	This game... It's just weird, in a good way. Kind of like Twin Peaks. If your into horror games and want to try a game that's out there. Pick this one up, it will not disappoint.
2913	This game is great, despite being (technically) clunky and having an unpolished gameplay. It is a great example that games don't need top production values in order to be good. I'd say it beats most of today's games in the game design department.
2914	Cult favorite and holds a record of most polarizing game ever and the 'best-worst game of this generation'... Quirky, scary, weird and at some points perhaps unintentionaly comedic but perhaps that is what makes this game special. Yes It may have awkward controls and other miscellaneous problems but the PC version helps amend these so I recommend if your a fan of survival horror/ weird games or love a plot that is actually compelling and complex like this hindered-masterpiece.   Supports Window Mode. Has controller compatibility. Changeable Graphic resolution.
2915	  This game is more campy then scary. For me it harks back to the days of watching X-Files.    This game is great but it does have its problems, and I'm not talking about the delicious cheese.  A few hardware issues: #Playing with your sound setting anying over Stereo, gonna have a bad time. (5.1 &amp; 7.1 surround is a no-no) #Now has built in controller support but aiming either with or without one is broken compared to the orginal game. (Aiming is resident evil 4 style over the shoulder but your stuck in the same cone of view and can't aim upwards much at all. This is actually a problem in the last boss fight as you must aim high.) #Resolution seems locked in at 720. Can be fixed through a third party modder whose link is in the Community Guides for this game. (Playing the game in windowed, I was fine with this actually.)  All of the issues I stated have work arounds but they're kinda janky. The work arounds I found are listed in the Community Guides section for this game.  If you can deal with all that then buy this game it's amazing. There's not a line in this game that isn't sweet, sweet necter.
2916	Twin Peaks: The Video Game
2917	Clear as a crisp spring morning
2918	My coffe made me play this game. And I don't regret a single moment spent playing it. The graphics are awful, the gameplay is horrible and sometimes frustrating, but the story makes you forget about the game's flaws. Twin Peaks like characters and setting, crazy dialogues, surprisingly good score. Go play it. Now.
2919	I love this game, it is one of the few games I have gotten all achievements with and I'm playing it all over again. Yes, there are holes, mighty big ones in fact, but it actually makes the game shine.   Here's a list as to why it sucks: Crashes often Plot is barely explained Plot holes Graphics are terrible Controls (on the xbox) are weird (LB to sprint?) [Also if you are playing with an xbox controller DO NOT I repeat DO NOT change the buttons, it does not work with the new scheme] Sound effects are weird and confusing at times (Squirrels make monkey noises apparently) Voices are not that great (What's with the reverb?) Hit boxes are confusing for both character and enemies (I got the lazer sword and cannot use it because of the hit boxes and because I get grappled too often) Weapons are okay (Some are difficult for me to use) AI is weird Slow spawning (for the Hell Dogs that is...) Car controls are abysmal (I can do a 360 in the air both forwards and sideways) There's a bar for everything (sleep, food, health and stamina you have monitor and if you like to be clean shaven, you have to watch your beard too (shame that you can't fully grow it out))  And there's more I probably forgot about, but this game got me hooked. I don't personally like horror games, but this one I just loved. One of the many things I loved about this game is that everybody had CHARACTER. It actually felt like meeting a real person, nobody's persona is baseless and everybody has a story, a secret, a dream and reasons for being the way that they are.   Terrible game but it's 10/10 for me!  
2920	Beyoutiful
2921	Weird but very enjoyable story.
2922	Iâm usually not a fan of the mystery genre, as there is a certain meaninglessness in turning a story into a guess-and-check puzzle. So believe me when I say that this is a whole lot more than a typical whodunit. Itâs a psychological character study on top of a horrific murder mystery. Deadly Premonition is like playing through a TV show (particularly Twin Peaks).  This rollercoaster of a game blends psychological perspective and universal laws, the physical world and the supernatural, quirky humor and nauseating tragedy, all in one interactive experience. The framing of the piece creates plot holes, which upon contemplation leave an emptiness inside your ribcage. The personal interpretations and unanswerable questions are really the scariest part about this game.   Itâs a shame this was given such a severely low budget, considering the remarkably high aspirations the development team had for the project. I suggest reading the English subtitles to avoid the charactersâ poorly animated mouths. Save as often as possible to avoid losing progress from crashes. But donât let the low production values fool you; if a bit of dialogue seems awkward and out of place, itâs supposed to be; if a character is acting strangely, donât assume they have one-dimensional motivations. Even though itâs a bit shoddy, this game is carefully crafted.   From a story standpoint, the characters are amazing. The main protagonist is Agent Francis York Morgan of the FBI. He is quite good at his job and has a polite, cheerful personality, albeit a strange lack of emotion. It gets interesting when he talks to his mysterious, other personality that goes by the name of Zach. The other main protagonist is Emily Wyatt, the Deputy Sheriff of the town. In her twenties, she seems to still possess a childlike innocence, while somehow managing to be an interesting character, free of any melodramatic, gag-worthy moments. Her personality does not fit her occupation, however, and she is not fit to be a cop. Things only get more interesting as the characters are put into play in the eerie town of Greenvale.  You just have to play it.
2923	Deadly Premonition is the vieo game verson of Twin Peaks but with a supernatual twist and a japanese charm. Recomended if you like small town murder mysteries with bizzar characters and if you like the odd obscure Japanese game.
2924	Install DPfix, get the FMV cutscenes working with the K-lite codec pack, then pray it won't crash all the time, and save often.  Fantastic David Lynch-esque story with deep characters, unlike anything you've ever played. 10/10
2925	The combat is atrocious, but the story is extremely entertaining, and is very easy to get immersed in. Enjoy your visit to Greenvale! Take your time and don't rush through the story!
2926	Spooky, funny, baffling... sometimes all at the same time. This game is fun to explore.
2927	It's so bad that it's pretty good.  Beware though, pc port is not too good. The controls work out fine, but getting it to run at times can be a pain. It can be worked around though.  I rarely had some cutscenes (about 2) crash the game, this is extremely annoying, but again, it can be worked around.  I really enjoyed the game at first, until around like episode 4 it starts dragging out and becomes very repetetive. There is a lack of enemy variety, (only about 3)
2928	Though for some reason I get terrible frames in this game (not optimized still?), I can't not recommend this game to fans of old Sega Dreamcast openworld adventure/mystery games (Shenmue, Blue Stinger, etc.). The music along with the dialogue is GOLD, if you're into more surreal, awkward humor. This game has gotten me to watch Twin Peaks, which I had previously refused to do, it's that infectious. Deadly Premonition certainly isn't for everyone and needs a special kind of eye to appreciate everything it has going for it. 9/10
2929	Definitely one of the most unique games: Deadly is a game that despite its many flaws, is worth playing. As many other people have said, it's so bad, it's good. The plot is bizarre, with odd twists and turns, though it does borrow heavily from Twin Peaks. However, it actually comes together quite nicely in the end and is certainly one of the most memorable I've seen in years. The gameplay reminds me of Majora's Mask, with the variety of side-quests that depend on the time of day.  Admittedly the gameplay can be cumbersome, and some of the side-quests are way more frustrating than they should be because of it. Also, there are a number of technical difficulties (I've died a few times by falling through the floor). However, if you can get past those annoyances, it's a game that is worth your time.
2930	A great game with extra staff . you should buy it .
2931	Positives: Fantastically weird characters, and dialog. Very Twin Peaks inspired setting. Some decently creepy moments. Absolutely deranged music.  Negatives: Dated visuals. Slightly clunky controls. Absolutely deranged music (sometimes it can be annoying!)
2932	Known issues: - No graphicsmenu -&gt; DPfix 0.9.5 - SoftwareTool to optimize gameGraphics and Bugs  - Crash at start -&gt; repair-Install PhysX_SystemSoftware.msi (Folder: \Steam\steamapps\common\Deadly Premonition The Director's Cut\redist)  - Crash at start AFTER first Cutscene: -&gt; remove LAV AudioFilter Software   Besides the PC-Version-Bugs: + Great Game + Played it on console and watched a whole, fantastic Let's Play. + It's weird, it's Twin-Peaks-ish, it's fantastic. + bought it in the HalloweenSale2014 for 2,50â¬ instead of 25â¬, which is okay for a little buggy game.  
2933	Played the crap out of this when it was first released on the Xbox 360. This is often thrown into the pool of 'so bad it's good' games, but I absolutely disagree with this notion. This game is incredible. It is flawed, very flawed, but it has character and soul that most games lack in abundance. It's fun, interesting, and it's really an unforetable experience. For best results, watch all of Twin Peaks before taking the dive into Deadly Premonition, which pays homage to Twin Peaks in really charming ways. 10/10
2934	This game is great, despite being (technically) clunky and having an unpolished gameplay. It is a great example that games don't need top production values in order to be good. I'd say it beats most of today's games in the game design department.
2935	this game is bat squeak crazy and for some reason i can't stop playing
2936	Funny and quirky all of the way through. 
2937	Twin Peaks: The Video Game
2938	This is the greatest achievement mankind has ever made. The pyramids of giza, the Collossus of Rhodes, the Empire State Building, and the whoopie pie combined cannot even begin to match the absolute perfection and impressiveness of this game. 10/10 would play with my dog.
2939	Very bug ridden game with terrible gameplay mechanics, shooting straight outta RE4, dressing system that does nothing. And the game looks like a PS2 era release. That being said it's one of my most favorite games ever released, horrible PC port though and that makes me sad, the games quirks all come together to make a very compelling story, finding out who did the murders was a thrill ride up until the very end. I'd say, if you can don't buy for PC but if it's your only option look for bugfixes, it's honestly a solid bar of gold under all the â¥â¥â¥â¥ on top of it. Rarely will you find a game as great as this one.
2940	I've been sitting outside this bar for 8 hours now smoking because I want to break up this guy's engagement so he'll give me an infinite wrench I can use to beat Sadoko to death. It should be open but it's raining. God dammit open the door I want to do other dumb side quests like teach a police officer how to cook while not solving the mystery everybody is always getting on my case about.
2941	This is the greatest game ever made. The graphics make it, the characters make it, the surprisingly living world makes it. It â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ on most of the 'Next-gen' crowd in my opinion.  Move over GTA with your civvies that complain about their TW@T net. Move over David Cage with your ham characters and QTE rain. Move over Resident Evil 6 here's a true horror game.  Make love to this
2942	There is always a director in japanese videogames: a director masterly chooses perspective in cutscenes and uniquely introduces stupendous characters, whose skeletons in the closed give you 15 hours of enhanced gameplay.   But first, make sure you caught enough breath, because authors will knock the stuffing out of you by all means and throw you in a great sea, that contains amazing stories about each inhabitant of Greenvale. This sea has hundrends of freshets, and, for example, zingy York is unquestionably perfect in all ways: in actions, gestures and facial expressions.  Every single  local freak is perfect in that ways too. Thus, youâll never want to leave these boondocks on the edge of civilization.  And the most enjoyable aspect of DP will help you capture dozens of seconds spent in that mysterious place. It is the soundtrack: atmospheric music and your guide in endless mind-voyage.
2943	Story of this game is well-made but also full of cliche, still fun. performance is low and lots of bugs and crashes. If you still want to play this game, you must prepare yourself with lots of patience for reboot your computer. I played this game about 48 hours (+several hours for reboot and finding solutions for crashes) but do not regret with it.
2944	Beyoutiful
2945	Perfection
2946	Creeeeeepy Japaneseness!!!! Like Resident evil! PS2 fun!! Washed out pallet... crazy zombies... more cut scenes than game.. bit Devil may cry...but is fun nice atmoshphere play it and try to understand the story off the bat?
2947	It's hard to talk about Deadly Premonition without sounding like everything you're saying is at best half-serious. I'll try anyway:  Deadly Premonition is one of the best games from the past five years or so I've played. It certainly doesn't show from the clunky controls or often-bizarre graphics, but somewhere around the midpoint of the game I realized that it manages to push past 'so-bad-it's-good' into territory of being actual, just-regular-type good.  Deadly Premonition uses the medium to tell a story surprisingly well, and even though it's obviously not for everyone (You will almost certainly love or hate this game), it's legitimately better than you might first expect.
2948	Just finished this game and definitely want more. Its storyline keeps you so wrapped up in what's going on and the characters that you don't want to put it down. I couldn't stay away once I started it! I highly highly highly recommend this game.   Didn't have some of the computer problems others are posting about, however it would crash once in a blue moon, but enough save points to where it didn't make me backtrack.   Get. This. Game!
2949	WORST PORT EVER
2950	In every possible quantifiable way, this game is terrible. The graphics are sub-par, the music is bad and the wrong volume. The voice acting is dry. This PC port crashes a lot. But by god, if it all doesn't come together somehow in a broken hot mess that's one of the most enjoyable games I've played in a while. As if Silent Hill and Twin Peaks had a twisted mutated baby.
2951	Filled with a patent strangeness not unlike that of Twin Peaks, Deadly Premonition provides an incredibly memorable cast of characters and an excellent story that will keep you guessing until the end. The game is thrilling, suspenseful, intense, cheesy, and ridiculous, with the right balance of each. It has relatively low production values, but it's almost endearing, feeling akin to cult B movies. This game has solidified itself as one of my favourites. I have no doubt I will come back and play this game again many times in the years to come, reliving the story and getting to know the citizens of Greenvale all over again. Right, Zach?  A quick disclaimer: This game is a relatively poorly done console port, so at the time of writing, there are some technical issues. I found the experience was greatly enhanced by using DPFix and JoyToKey to play with a controller with better looking visuals. Crashes were rare for me, and I was able to play the game without too many problems, but some others have had trouble running the game. The developers have expressed intent to fix these issues, though, so we will hopefully see an improvement soon.
2952	Deadly Premonition is a game unlike any other that has came out in recent years. The way in which the story grips you, the way you relate to the protagonist, the way the small town the game is set in is always alive, the... Well, just everything about this game sets it apart from the rest of the market today.   The story of Deadly Premonition centres around FBI agent Francis York Morgan who is sent to the small rural town of Greenvale to investigate the tragic and mysterious death of a young girl, Anna Graham. Upon nearing Greenvale, however, he is swerved off the road and comes to in a strange place known as the âother worldâ. Whilst attempting to make his way out of here, York catches a glimpse of an enigmatic axe-wielding man. Eventually you escape and make your way back towards the town, it is here that the first of the colourful cast are introduced. The sherriff of Greenvale, George Woodman, and his deputy, Emily Wyatt, greet York just outside of town and provide an escort to the hotel, where work on solving this case can finally begin.  It is here where the character of Zach is firmly introduced into the game, and the way in which it is done, will grip you for the entirety of the games 26 chapters. The player takes on the eponym of Zach throughout the game and is consistently addressed by York when left alone. When driving, or wandering through town, York gleefully strikes up a discussion about one of many different topics. From childhood memories and music to sharing his encyclopeadic knowledge of the film industry, there is no shortage of dialog in these moments of solitude.   As mentioned earlier, however, there is quite a large and colourful cast of characters within Greenvale, each with their own story to tell and each possibly implicated in the murder of Anna Graham. From the effiminate policeman, Thomas MacLain; the potato-chip enthusiast and local doctor, Ushah Johnson or; the travelling sapling salesman, Forrest Kaysen. Each and every resident of Greenvale is memorable for their own reason, and further pulls you into the game and into the role of York.   Encounters with these residents are not isolated incidents, as the world of Deadly Premonition is constantly alive. Each person lives out their lives with their own daily routine, oftentimes they can be seen passing you on the streets or hanging out at the local bar, the SWERY '65 (a nod to the developer of the game Hidetaka Suehiro, SWERY for short). As such, every moment in Greenvale feels unique, a feeling that hasn't been represented in gaming since Yu Suzuki's Shenmue for the SEGA Dreamcast in 1992. Most of the residents have their own sidequests attached to them, and the rewards for these greatly assist in completing the game, with new weapons and discount cards being just an example. These sidequests can be creative as well, from assisting Emily in bettering her abilities as a chef; helping Anna's mother deal with her loss or reorganising the store room of the convenience store. Everywhere you go, there will always be something to do or something to see, and there is almost always a benefit to exploring Greenvale.   Unfortunately, this is where some of the problems of Deadly Premonition rear their head. The map provided to you can be difficult to use as it faces in the direction that York is facing when you open it. This means that if you were to check the map to see where you are going, then check again to see if you were still on the right track, the map can look completely different. The map can't be rotated once it's open and also can't be zoomed out to a comfortable level, always feeling a little too zoomed in, forcing you to learn the town's layout rather than rely too heavily on the in-game map.   The layout of Greenvale isn't the only that you need to keep in the back of your mind, however. Firstly, there is a stamina meter in the game, meaning that running for too long or attacking too many times in succession can cause York to stumble around blindly for a moment whilst he catches his breath. Hunger and tiredness also play a role in the game and can be checked at any point by accessing the pause menu. Food is littered throughout town and the various âother worldâ levels that you venture through, and therefore isn't much of a problem. Even if you are out of food for whatever reason, there are many places in Greenvale where you can get a meal at a price. As for tiredness, this is replenished through either sleeping at various beds scattered through Greenvale, or by consuming coffee. Lastly, the game has a 24 hour timing system where certain places and events become inaccessible late in the day. You can sleep to fast forward up to 12 hours at a time, however sleeping for too long will cause you to gain hunger and also cause your clothes to need washing (yes, you read that right).   The little things that you have the ability to do in the game is a small but interesting detail. Clothes can be washed, your beard can be shaved and we haven't even gotten to the driving yet. Deadly Premonition is a free roam game, but not in the same vein as, say, Saints Row. You have the ability to explore Greenvale freely and it is encouraged to do so, as such York is provided a Master Key to all the police cars in town soon after arriving (though several more cars can be unlocked later into the game). If driving at night, you can use your headlight; rain, use the wipers; need to turn, then indicate. All of these little nuances, on top of everything else mentioned earlier, cements you into the game and makes you feel as though you are York, as though you are the protagonist. A feat which is not easily achieved and one that SWERY should be commended for accomplishing.  Though not all is well in Greenvale, and it is still your job to uncover what is going on. Upon progressing through the game, you learn the folklore of the Raincoat Killer. A mysterious figure who, in the 1950's, went on a murderous rampage through Greenvale; a legend that instills fear into even the youngest of its residents, resulting in a town that stands still when it rains. These are the times when York often ends up in the âother worldâ.   These sections are filled with enemies and puzzles that must be overcome before you can return to the normal Greenvale. Hidden within these words are often vital clues to uncovering Anna's tragic death. Often the word âPROFILINGâ fills the screens whilst York nonchalantly lights a cigarette. This is followed by many static images that flash before your eyes as you try and piece together what is happening in this small town. As you progress through the âother worldâ, these images will slowly clear up, allowing York to slowly piece together the events that occurred.   Progression through these sections is slowed by a number of zombie-esque enemies known as âShadowsâ. These enemies move slowly and are unarmed at first, but soon they will be wielding pitchforks and eventually shotguns. Though they aren't difficult to kill, they often respawn and, as a result, become more of a threat as a mob, rather than when taken individually. To bring them down, York can arm himself with a variety of weapons, including shovels, axes, shotguns and rifles. The combat takes the over-the-shoulder format that was popularised by Resident Evil 4, meaning that you are frozen in place whilst ever you are lining up a shot. This serves to intensify the action sequences, limiting the shots to only those that are essential so as to keep moving and outrun the shadows hunting you down.  To further hinder progress, several puzzles lye in the way to solving this case. Though, unfortunately, these are never too tricky, as they are mostly explained upfront and serve more as a motivation to explore these levels rather than to test your ability.  Continued...
2953	Absolutely terrible port! No graphic option, not even resolution. It has a crashed a lot of times for me.  As a game I have mixedfeelings. First impression was a low budget game with terrible writing and voice acting, yet for some reason I kept playing. The story got somewhat interesting and made me wanna see the ending. Halfway through the game the story just takes a turn for freaking weird. It's a shame cause it had could have been a very interresing story.  On the gameplay side there are a lot of things wrong with the game. The driving for one is abysmal, you would have more luck driving concrete then cars in this game. The shooting is a bit so so but entertaining enough. There are a lot of sidemissions which are basicly all very short and very boring. The writing of some of the dialogue can be absolutely terrible, whilst the writing of the main story is not to bad.  Oh and make no mistake this is not a horror game not by a long shot! It's more of a murder mystery game, yet it's so weird it's hard to follow what is actually going on.  Still even in all it's flaws I would recommend trying it.  6/10
2954	This game can be summed up pretty easily: Twin Peaks plus zombies. 
2955	This game is like an alien, I don't know how to describe this game in another way. XD  The graphic are not terrible ( feel like it's PS2 games ), but the characters are not that bad, I mean like York is not the most pretty character but still with time I start to like him, Emily are really cute too ^^, the animations, well sometime they are okay and many times are really weird and you feel like your are in a town of robots.  The voices are sometime not great sometime I forgot that point since I focus on what they said.  The controls are not that great.  And still if you survive all of that and you're like me and prefer to focus on the good points, I think we have a game with many good idea, you explore the town, learn about peoples around, what they do, the secret of the place. You take care of the character, eat, sleep, clean him ( shave him actually ) or his clothes ( have a night with a character with fly around because your clothes are dirty it's really weird and funny XD ). I like when York talk about movies, musics, old cases. I still don't have finish the game but I really want to know the end of this investigation.  So, I can't blame peoples who will hate this game because it's some kind of ugly for a 2013 games, but at the same times I now know what so many peoples recommend this game and me too I now recommend this game if you can deal with his 'bad' side ( 'bad' side who are for me like a bad horror movies but who are actually good because it's the style of the movie ).  A deadly premonition 2 with better graphic and animation with the good idea of this game could be a big hit I'm sure. :)
2956	  This game is more campy then scary. For me it harks back to the days of watching X-Files.    This game is great but it does have its problems, and I'm not talking about the delicious cheese.  A few hardware issues: #Playing with your sound setting anying over Stereo, gonna have a bad time. (5.1 &amp; 7.1 surround is a no-no) #Now has built in controller support but aiming either with or without one is broken compared to the orginal game. (Aiming is resident evil 4 style over the shoulder but your stuck in the same cone of view and can't aim upwards much at all. This is actually a problem in the last boss fight as you must aim high.) #Resolution seems locked in at 720. Can be fixed through a third party modder whose link is in the Community Guides for this game. (Playing the game in windowed, I was fine with this actually.)  All of the issues I stated have work arounds but they're kinda janky. The work arounds I found are listed in the Community Guides section for this game.  If you can deal with all that then buy this game it's amazing. There's not a line in this game that isn't sweet, sweet necter.
2957	Iâm usually not a fan of the mystery genre, as there is a certain meaninglessness in turning a story into a guess-and-check puzzle. So believe me when I say that this is a whole lot more than a typical whodunit. Itâs a psychological character study on top of a horrific murder mystery. Deadly Premonition is like playing through a TV show (particularly Twin Peaks).  This rollercoaster of a game blends psychological perspective and universal laws, the physical world and the supernatural, quirky humor and nauseating tragedy, all in one interactive experience. The framing of the piece creates plot holes, which upon contemplation leave an emptiness inside your ribcage. The personal interpretations and unanswerable questions are really the scariest part about this game.   Itâs a shame this was given such a severely low budget, considering the remarkably high aspirations the development team had for the project. I suggest reading the English subtitles to avoid the charactersâ poorly animated mouths. Save as often as possible to avoid losing progress from crashes. But donât let the low production values fool you; if a bit of dialogue seems awkward and out of place, itâs supposed to be; if a character is acting strangely, donât assume they have one-dimensional motivations. Even though itâs a bit shoddy, this game is carefully crafted.   From a story standpoint, the characters are amazing. The main protagonist is Agent Francis York Morgan of the FBI. He is quite good at his job and has a polite, cheerful personality, albeit a strange lack of emotion. It gets interesting when he talks to his mysterious, other personality that goes by the name of Zach. The other main protagonist is Emily Wyatt, the Deputy Sheriff of the town. In her twenties, she seems to still possess a childlike innocence, while somehow managing to be an interesting character, free of any melodramatic, gag-worthy moments. Her personality does not fit her occupation, however, and she is not fit to be a cop. Things only get more interesting as the characters are put into play in the eerie town of Greenvale.  You just have to play it.
2958	When I finished this game I didn't know whether to â¥â¥â¥â¥ or wind my watch but i loved every bit of it.
2959	A beautiful, terrifying disaster. Make sure that you download the DPfix mod to use higher resolutions.
2960	If you like Twin Peaks buy it now.  If not, the other reviews have got it covered.
2961	What this game lacks in visuals Alan Wake has them, what Alan Wake lacks in ambition this game has it. This game is a problem, but a good one.
2962	It's hard to talk about Deadly Premonition without sounding like everything you're saying is at best half-serious. I'll try anyway:  Deadly Premonition is one of the best games from the past five years or so I've played. It certainly doesn't show from the clunky controls or often-bizarre graphics, but somewhere around the midpoint of the game I realized that it manages to push past 'so-bad-it's-good' into territory of being actual, just-regular-type good.  Deadly Premonition uses the medium to tell a story surprisingly well, and even though it's obviously not for everyone (You will almost certainly love or hate this game), it's legitimately better than you might first expect.
2963	8/10 Played this first on the Xbox. A â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game with a fantastic story. If you can suffer through the horrible driving an medieval graphics for a truly rewarding mystery this game is for you.
2964	Mr. Random Review Reader  '10/10'  So Says Mr. Stewart.
2965	Visually and mechanically, Deadly Premonition is way, way below what you'd expect from a modern game.  Genuinely one of my favourite games ever made. Isn't that right, Zach?
2966	Struggled to get it working initially, but this game is inexplicably terribly made and a great experience.
2967	An amazing game, one the best of the last generation, and also one of my favorite games of all time even though it doesn't shine technically. The graphics aren't very good, the controls are clunky but the atmosphere, setting and characters are outstanding and make the purchase really worth it. Another thing I'd like to add is that the game really benefits from a PC port, the graphics don't magically turn perfect but they are better on PC. Also a stable framerate is a gift of god.
2968	Turn signals and windshield wipers make this game a more realistic driving simulator than forza motorsport or grand turismo. Solid 5/7

2976	Probably the greatest story ever told. And by told I mean straight ripped of of Twin Peaks. But still great. The humor is quirky, the characters are memorable. The gameplay leaves a little something to be desired, but most of the issues from the original version have been fixed. Play it once, love it forever. An eternal favorite.
2977	Zach, have you heard of the 2010 video game Deadly Premonition, directed by Hidetaka Suehiro? It's about an FBI agent investigating a mysterious murder in a seemingly peaceful small town. On the surface it looks to be based on the 1990 television show Twin Peaks, but it really takes the idea in a new direction. It's a very unique experience!  I vividly recall the wonderfully awkward voice acting and sound design over all else. The song 'Life is Beautiful' holds a particularly special place in my heart. Combined with the dated-yet-endearing graphics the game oozes an inimitable charm. Though Deadly Premonition mainly involves driving around Greenvale to investigate the murder and interrogate suspects, there are 3rd-person shooting sections where you fight paranormal monsters! Such scary fun! The controls were a little tough to work with at times, but nothing unmanageable.   Even though the game crashed on me several times I always came back to learn more about the strange residents of Greenvale and the bizarre story. Thankfully there are fans that love the game so much that they created their own patches to fix some of the problems! I highly recommend you look into them, Zach.  What's that Zach? Coffee? What a fantastic idea!

2983	Great game, bad port. The game is quite unlike anything else. And it's got a bit of the 'So bad it's good' type of game going on. There are some serious bugs, though with some quick fixes the game breaking ones can be fixed and just some hilarious ones (had someone fall through their driveway as they pulled into it) will remain.   Everything Deadly Premonitions does is generally mediocre, but it doesn't feel like a knock off, it feels more like a self acknowledged B-Movie. And although it may not have had a large amount of fame, the game has gotten a cult fanbase and become a hit among its fans.  The gunplay is essentially Resident Evil 4 mixed with Silent Hill. The enemies aren't particularly tough, they don't generally evolve much, but they're creepy and they feel right at home with the silent hill like areas of the game. The driving portions control like a PS2 game, and not GTA quality either. The map also makes the driving a major pain as it can be frustrating to figure out where you wanted to get to without any waypoints or minimap GPS. And there's some simple detective work with generally easy side quests.  The game is open world during some portions, giving you anywhere from half an hour to several hours of real time to wander around, do minigames, simple sidequests, or gather collectables. There's a ton of optional content to keep you busy and it makes the game well worth the money as far as content goes. There's a few 'realistic' elements to the gameplay, such as a need to eat and sleep, these don't really ever detract from the main game though, and never feel like they're a problem. I constantly found myself with TOO much free time and slept in between missions.  The game really shines with how awkward it is. The dialogue at times doesn't even make sense, and is often thrown in front of hilariously inappropriate music. The animations during cutscenes are all fairly terrible and it adds to the charm. The game will jump from a serious sob story, to a completly out of place morbid joke in a heartbeat. And its fantastic. The community has uploaded several recordings of such scenes and it truly shows how surreal the developers are.  The game really requires a sense of humor and a bit of patience with some of its flaws, but if you can overlook them the game is a hidden gem. For an example of the humor see this         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Deadly Premonition: Possibly the funniest cutscene in the game&nbsp;

2992	Suda51 + Twin Peaks' lovechild. All time GOTY.   Horrible, horrible PC port though, be warned. 
2993	It's good.
2994	This is, hands down, my favorite 360 game from 2010. It started development as a PS2 game, and still looks and plays pretty much like a PS2 game.   Unfortunately it also isn't the best port. It has controller support, but there are some weird issues with the triggers that gets kind of annoying. Also at times your framerate will drop to single digits and the only way to fix it is to restart your PC, so that's weird.  But basically it's a Japanese take on David Lynch's Twin Peaks, just put into a videogame. The characters are eccentric and endearing, and the mystery and presentation of the story is actually pretty engaging. The shooting and driving isn't so great, but the game has so much god damn heart it's hard to be upset at it.
2995	The bad: It's not a good port, you must use a small mod to get it to run in 1080.  The good: It's batshit crazy - so bad it's good.  If it wasn't buggy I'd give it an 9/10 so far.  I'll let IGN explain it ...  'Imagine if you took the complete script from David Lynchâs Twin Peaks television series, translated it into Japanese, then translated it back into English, then had a drunk friend read it to you from the passenger seat of your car while they clumsily flicked between obscure jazz radio stations that intermittently fluctuated in volume.'

2998	THANK YOU BASED DURANTE  http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/ 
2999	Mr. Francis York Morgan,  Technically,  DP  is a charlie foxtrot It's ugly, and crashes a lot  You'll have to wrestle with it to play Set compatibility and back up your saves  The port to mouse is cause to frown York can aim neither up nor down  It makes attempts to be realistic But lays the uncanny valley effect on thick  E.g., a map to some godforsaken hole Costs 71 times the fine for destroying a telephone pole  And you can subsist on cans of tomato paste Open them first? But that would be a waste!  The presence of zombies is never explained (Save that without them, revenue might not be gained)  Gameplay has a few minor flaws Like the crazy handling when driving cars  Even so, if you're playing for the story Buy it (on sale); you won't be sorry  You control a federal investigator Tracking a supernatural serial killer  The fourth wall is cleverly under attack York is schizo, and thinks you're his friend Zach  You'll travel to a small town and meet the residents Who have lives of their own (and don't always make sense)  Question them, and learn the local folklore Might it be real and connected to the recent gore?  You'll find there's more to this case than meets the eye If at the Raincoat Killer's hands you don't die  Still, no need to rush in investigating the deaths Goodness knows, there's always time for sidequests  So says Mr. Stewart.  Note for pedants who have already played the game:   I know York has dissociative identity disorder, not schizophrenia, but it looks like schizophrenia until episode 6, and I don't want to spoil that reveal.  
3000	Played for about 10 minutes so far and a squirrel was about to get hit by a car and made monkey noises before running off. Oh, and two little boys seemed more interested in a lady bug than a dead woman tied up to a tree with her guts spilled out and their grandpa didn't even think to get them away from the murder scene once the police arrived.  Really good so far.  42/10
3001	What an awkward game... 6/10
3002	not rlly dedly jsut totly tubular  80/100
3003	Deadly Premonition is hard to write anything for without giving away spoilers, so I will break this down into two sections: A simple spoiler-free 'Pros &amp; Cons' section with a summary of my review, followed by a spoiler-filled review.  Pros: + Lovable characters in a charming setting + Extremely relaxing atmosphere and gameplay pacing + Hilarious dialogue and (mostly) gripping plot + Tons of side quests and post-game content to explore  Cons: - Frequent crashes (both random &amp; reproducable) - Terrible port that isn't optimized for modern PCs - Clunky, unsatisfying combat with terrible SFX - An overabundance of ammo, healing items, and other pointless pick-ups (food &amp; sleep were almost never needed) - Many boring, drawn-out travel sequences that are unskippable - Terribly timed and overused QTEs - Tons of muddy, low-rez textures - Heavily compressed low-rez cutscenes - A ridiculous ending that almost ruined the game   Overall, Deadly Premonition is a one-of-a-kind game. I would recommend you at least give it a chance because you might not experience a game like it again. It certainly has its ups and downs; the good parts are excellent and the bad parts are godawful, but in the end you have something really memorable here that is worth playing... if you can get it to work properly.   Spoilers below, you have been warned!  I went into Deadly Premonition expecting 'Resident Evil with FBI Agents' and instead received 'Shenmu with Zombies'. While the town of Greenvale is very charming and cozy, I feel that more attention went into the production of this digital town than anything else. It's a great place to explore but I felt no reason to considering how literally overburdened I became with pickups (many times my extra storage also became full) just by playing the main story. Its a shame Greenvale's attention to detail wasn't put into the combat sequences of the game; the Resident Evil-esque generic horror music becomes very repetitive and the combat's SFX are weak, hollow stock effects that almost put me to sleep many times.  Although the game starts out believably enough, with you chasing a string of serial killer murders in a quiet town, the game started to introduce 'supernatural' elements that I assumed were the main character hallucinating. In fact, the other world invasions seemed to all be in Zach's head up until you control Emily in the clock tower and she has to deal with them too. At this point I was really worried that the whole game was taking a literal approach to the events happening. I don't know if the game was rushed, or if there were massive re-writes, but things got really, really stupid during Episode 5 &amp; 6 at the end of the game. I wish more time had been spent on fleshing out a proper psychological thriller rooted in reality rather than the supernatural DMC-style boss fights and plot changes that comprised the last two episodes of the game.  All this is assuming you can get the game to run (and keep it running) on your computer. Even with a fan-made patch (provided by Durante, the man behind DSfix for Dark Souls) that has been updated many times since launch, DP is plagued with random freezes, random crashes to desktop, and freezing at reproducable spots. Lots of other small issues caused me to replay tedious sections of the game (opening the browser in steam overlay crashed DP almost everytime, alt+tabbing WILL crash the game, etc.); even though I finished the game in about 17 hours, I have 24 hours clocked on Steam because of all the issues I had. There were many other small issues that detracted from the game, such as sound moving around seemingly randomly between speakers if you don't have Windows set to Stereo sound, that make me wonder if ANY QA went into this game.  While I wanted to love this game, the last two episodes were a jarring and ridiculously over-the-top change of pace that felt like jumping from watching an American TV series to watching the last two episodes of an anime. In fact, Deadly Premonition plays more like an episodic TV series, broken down into bite-sized chapters (with 'Previously during the investigation...' segments) than an actual video game. Deadly Premonition is a very unique experience but definitely won't be appreciated by everyone. If this game worked properly, I would be more apt to recommend it. As it stands, it is a crash-riddled mess than is probably better experienced on a console.
3004	One of the best games I've ever played. Based Swery.
3005	its so bad its good
3006	DONT BUY!!!!!! ITS A TRAP!!!!
3007	BEST GAME EVER  BUY THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING GAME ALREADY YOU SCRUB THIS IS THE WORST PC PORT YOU WILL EVER PLAY BUT ITS THE BEST GAME YOU WILL EVER PLAY AND IT WILL MAKE YOU CRY LIKE A BABY BY THE END OF IT.
3008	Twin Peaks + Silent Hill + GTA = ??? Ugly and quirky, the atmosphere and style are awesome nevertheless, plot is good and gameplay is generally ok. The musical score has some gems as well. Would love to see the sequel or something spiritually similar done with an AAA budget.
3009	I temporarily stopped playing this game to watch the movies York was talking about. Thanks, Zach!
3010	It has problems right from the beginning, at first the game crashed on me until i used a patch after thoroughly searched the internet for it, you are faced with bad graphics and the shooting mechanics are extremely similar to Resident Evil 4 but that's irrelevant when you enter the twisted and somewhat funny story of Deadly Premonition. I have to admit, i haven't seen in my life characters so unique and entertaining while remaining mysterious, creepy and peculiar at the same time. The story is compelling and the way the game goes are 'too real' for a generic sandbox game, you put gasoline in your car, you use the turn signals in your car, you cannot overspeed (not always) and if you don't change your clothes regularly you'll get dirty and flies will fly over you. It's sense of humour always makes me come back for more and, if you forgive these problems i just mentioned in this review, you too.  Good Luck, Zach
3011	It's alright.
3012	This game is so horrible, weird and ugly, it makes you like it. I feel like I am being indoctrinated into some sick cult. If you're a fan of Twin Peaks and similar stuff, you should try it. Otherwise, don't.
3013	A weird but gripping third-person action thriller. If you're willing to overlook the technical flaws, awkward design and terrible port job, this is a true gem waiting to be found.
3014	The game has squirrels. 10/10
3015	If you like good stories then this one will get hold of you like nothing else in videogames. The graphics, combat system and narrative seem cheap and slightly broken at first and you'll be amused in an ironic sort of way. Quickly this disappears to be replaced by genuine affection for the characters, the town and even the things that you previously considered broken. I wouldn't change a thing.
3016	It's hard to recommend this in a normal way, because this is one that you just get it or you don't. I absolutely love it. And it's not even 'so bad it's good', I mean yeah, the graphics and animations and voices and everything are so kooky but it's an open world psychological survival horror thriller where everyone has their own schedules, and you have to eat/shave/do laudry and there's all sorts of weird side quests, some of which can't even be done until you've beaten it a few times, and Francis York Morgan is one of the single greatest video game characters ever.  I don't know, I mean, I get why at face value some people can't get behind it, but I just really feel like if you actually play it and still don't like it, I mean, I kinda feel sorry for you.
3017	Zach, my coffee warned me about this PC port.  Play this on console if you can. Most people wouldn't bother to troubleshoot all the issues to get through this game but for some reason I did. I don't regret it at all though.
3018	This game is balls. This game is seriously balls. It crashes, it burns, it sucks the soul out of me.  3/5, it's neutrally positively horrible.
3019	Gameplay isn't the best, but the story is good. One of the best games I ever played.
3020	Have you wondered what would happen if you replaced everyone in RE4 with ham actors? Well wonder no more cause that's what Deadly Premonition is, delicious ham acting. Yeah there are times that the voices would change tone mid-conversation, and the driving is pure-crap but that's ok the story makes up for it so much.   9/10 wish it had less bugs  P.S. You shoot a tree with moving hands, just so you can get a hand shaped doorknob.
3021	Let me tell you something about Deadly Premonition. The controls are clunky, and driving, being maybe half of the game, is a nightmare. The character animations are awkward and at times terrifying. The squirrels make public-domain monkey noises and the fast travel mechanic (if you get it) is punctuated with a cartoon car crash sound. The voice acting ranges from actually enjoyable to god-awful. Half of the time, the game crashes or won't let me load my saves, and I had to download a patch just to get the game to run at over 720p.  This might be one of the best games I've ever played. 'Twin Peaks: The Game' is an accurate description for the storyline -- Except York could challenge Agent Cooper one-on-one with how downright charming he is as a character. If nothing else, play for the story and the interactions between the characters; this game has some moments that are truly hilarious, and some that are just completely off-the-wall, and the end has a twist that will make you want to replay to truly understand what's happened. True, you could just watch a Let's Play on Youtube, but in doing so you'll miss half of the true charm. The side-missions, while infuriating, and the long monologues York has in the driving sections are really the cherry on top of this sundae of dysfunctional oddity. This isn't a game for everyone, but if you do like it, it's like this game was made for you.  In short: This game is awful. I love every awful moment of it.
3022	This is the worst game I've ever played in my life.
3023	Imagine if Twin Peaks was made by a semi-â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Japanese man named Swery and that's essentially what Deadly Premonition is.  I love it and you should too.
3024	If you like campy movies and can get past the ps2 level graphics, Deadly Premonition has enough charm to keep you interested.
3025	Everyone has issues with this game working well. FIX THIS SWERY!
3026	B. U. Y. in the coffee! Did you see that, Zach?!
3027	It's hard to objectively define Deadly Premonition. Perhaps it's a game so bad that it's somehow good. Perhaps it's a game intentionally bizarre and profound which is rough around the edges. Either way, it's not a forgettable game. That much is certain.  If I tried to review it on it's merits, the review would come across overly negative - the simple reason being it lacks them. Graphically it's poor. The soundtrack is forgettable. The gameplay is fairly boring. The controls are pretty bad. The constant onslaught of driving from place to place is dull. I could go on.  Despite this, the plot while hardly a masterpiece is just weird enough to keep you hooked. The protagonist is curiously unusual and his supporting cast unpredictable. All things considered, the game rarely goes where you expect it to, breaking most of it's tropes and keeping things fresh. It's suffice to say you'll keep playing just to see what crazy sh*t Deadly Premonition pulls next.  That is, if you can make it work. The PC port is nothing short of awful. In order to get a smooth experience, you'll need mods. At minimum, DPFix should be used. For a more solid, enjoyable experience, you can use some texture mods and SweetFX. The game is also full of bugs. I had to launch the game from the main exe as the launcher was incapable of doing so. I also had to patch the game to be large-address aware due to a fairly aggressive memory leak. I'd also strongly recommend a gamepad. Even after all this, the game still has a number of issues, but it's certainly playable.   So, do I recommend Deadly Premonition? I'd say yes, but barely. Pick it up cheap and hope to heck you can make it work. If so, you're in for a wild ride... for better or for worse.
3028	If you love survival horror games and Twin Peaks, you'll freaking love this game. Great game that was really underated.
3029	At the technical level, this thing is a travesty, frequent crashes, barebones gameplay that barely functions, visuals that seem to belong on the PS2, a lot of segments that seem to be pretty much filler, and at times the situations make so little sense that it would normally kill all suspension of disbelief, and yet I can't help but love the game, it might sound strange but the game has charm out the â¥â¥â¥, quirky likable characters, a plot that is mostly interesting, even if it times shoots itself in the foot occasionally. But the quirky characters, sheer ambition, attention to small details, and town that in some regards feels more alive than the cities in your typical Open Sandbox game make the game an experience unlike any other, though the original Xbox 360 version might be the best one from what I can gather.
3030	One of the best games in last generation. Also, one of the best games ever. Almost at the ART level. The problem is... as game this â¥â¥â¥â¥ sucks badly. Everything beside gameplay is gold. Gamaplay is brown. Still, you must play it, there is simply nothing like this around. Beside this. Really good.
3031	Here's what I recommend:  1. Buy the game; support the developer 2. Don't play it 3. Watch all the cutscenes on Youtube  While there's approximately 6 hours of cutscenes, you'll find this to be much more enjoyable. The game portion of it isn't that bad, but you're just playing it to see what happens next.   Or you could just watch Twin Peaks (Oh damn, betcha never heard that one before).  This gentleman/woman took the time to piece together everything. Youtube link:         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Deadly Premonition: Director's Cut - The Movie / All Cutscenes in 1080p [1/3]&nbsp;
3032	B. U. Y. in the coffee! Did you see that, Zach?!
3033	I got The Pickles. Rating: 10/10 - Would shoot Japanese ghost acrobats again
3034	I mean, to say this is basically  Twin Peaks: The Video Game  would not only be far from a unique observation, but also an incredibly surface level impression. Sure, much like  Twin Peaks , the goofy and awkward nature of the game only adds to the charm and does nothing to detract the effectiveness of the genuinely spooky elements. The thing about  Deadly Premonition  is that it is significantly darker and the awkward quirky-ness is also reflected into the graphics.   Still, I'm only, like, a chapter in and I know I'll be pouring way more hours into this than I probably should. The gameplay works sort of like  L.A. Noire . The game isn't as much about gameplay as it is about story. The combat isn't the most important part. The 'game' operates much more like an interactive film or television show ('Previously in the investigation' or something along those lines greets you after loading the game)  I suppose my only complaint is that some of the combat sequences seem out of place. The game shines its brightest in the script and characters so maybe the awkward combat mechanics just pale in comparison to the strange town of Greenvale.  Deadly Premonition  is probably one of my favorite games out there right now.
3035	This is a one B-movie of a game. Imagine a Japanese Fred Olen Ray shooting a Twin Peaks rip-off with a twist of Silent Hill and a bit of GTA. The result is a campy and cliched mess that for some unexplainable reason fits really well into late-night TV program. You hate the game for being stupid and ugly and buggy, but can't stop playing it because it's obviously a labour of love.  Too bad the publisher doesn't give a rat's â¥â¥â¥ about compatibility. Many complain about technical issues to the point that the PC port being totally unplayable. So it would probably be a better idea to get a PS3 version - which has it's own problems as well, but at least is more stable.
3036	For folks on the fence about buying the PS3 or the PC version of Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut...here's my take. But first, a warning:   The PC port truly does crash often. I solved most of the random crashing by running in fullscreen windowed mode using DPFix and applying the LAA patch (Google it) to the .exe. There are still a few events that cause the game to crash despite this, and it's a shame since this is the superior version once DPFix is applied.  Even though there is the risk of the game crashing, I would recommend playing the PC version over the PS3 version (again, with DPFix - I can't stress this enough). I played with a 360 controller on a nice HTPC at 1080p/60fps and it ran beautifully. The high ramerate really made the combat areas enjoyable since there was little input lag. Driving was fine as well, even though the engine is super wonky. It's important to note that the PC version also comes with all the DLC (the Field-Ops suit is game breakingly awesome!!)  The PS3 version is stable, but the framerate is pretty terrible. It made both combat and driving a bit of a chore since it's harder to aim guns or turn your car. It caused me to overcorrect quite a bit and was highly annoying. It's also running at 720p with no anti-aliasing, so things look a bit chunky and washed out. BUT - when I played it, it didn't crash on me, so that's a huge plus. The PS3 version doesn't come with any DLC, which kind of sucks since the suits are $2+ each.  TLDR; I recommend the PC version over the PS3 version *as long as you have some patience and can tolerate crashes*. With the PC version and DPfix, you're going to get a better looking game and a substantially better experience during combat and driving...and all the DLC. If you can't tolerate crashing, go with the PS3 version. It's stable, but combat and driving (and really most of the game) are hampered by an erratic framerate that really detracts from the experience...and you don't get any DLC.  In closing: this game is freaking awesome, and everyone should play it.
3037	Not the best port, but it's absolutely one of the best games ever made. Feels like a long-lost Dreamcast game with absolutely incredible characters, story, and world-building. Worth playing on whatever platform you can.
3038	This game is polarizing. You either love it or you hate it. The pc version has a kind of cost at entry, where you have to root out various bugs and hindrances in order to play unaccosted. once you get set up and stabalize it however it's pretty good. This is probably the single greatest example of making good on incredibly low budget. Deadly premonition was originally a ps2 game which was bumped up in scale before being released for the xbox and ps3, this means that it has a lot of the quirk and 'jank' that you get from old school ps2 games with a larger scale and length.  Over all Deadly Premonition is an exercise in video game weirdness, the merit of the game comes less from the plot or gameplay and more from 'Wow look how weird this guy's character model is when he's smilling' or 'pffft that zombies running sideways.' Kind of a more eloquent goat simulator.  This games charm is impossible to describe, so for reference go and watch the 'two best friends play' of deadly premonition where they will constantly and in detail describe why the game is REALLY GOOD while also looking terrible.

3039	Achievement is named Anna's Dairy 10/10
3040	Zach, could you recommend this?
3041	A weird but gripping third-person action thriller. If you're willing to overlook the technical flaws, awkward design and terrible port job, this is a true gem waiting to be found.
3042	This game is so horrible, weird and ugly, it makes you like it. I feel like I am being indoctrinated into some sick cult. If you're a fan of Twin Peaks and similar stuff, you should try it. Otherwise, don't.
3043	Twin Peaks the game 10/10 pretty good. Port is garbage though; so are the quick time events.
3044	If you like good stories then this one will get hold of you like nothing else in videogames.

3046	Well io would love to play this game but it crashes as soon as I click the Play button......?
3047	Honestly, this game is worth every dollar.   The downside for me was the numerous lags. The game in itself wasn't difficult but I had to look for ''walkthrough'' to avoid the lags and be able to keep playing, which is a shame really. The game in itself is a melting pot of humor, horror and drama. The story and characters are awesome and makes you want to keep playing to know what happens next.   For me, this was a little gem and I'm recommending it for anyone who wants something a little different.
3048	+Incredibile story and characters +With mods, and while the game is not suffering from technical issues, it is the most definitive version of the game. +gameplay  -Gameplay -lacks graphics option (the game is set on defaut in 1280x720 vsync on)Use DPfix to increase rendering resolution along with many other options.  For fix and mod visit this site   http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Deadly_Premonition:_The_Director%27s_Cut 
3049	It's a weird game. Play it only if you have the patience to absorb the bugs and a bad port. Aiming weapons is really limited. Driving is atrocious. I have an issue with side quests available during a particular weather. That doesn't make sense. But availability of side quests at certain timings in a day is realistic. But the game has a good story, keeps you guessing on who the killer is. All the characters are well written and there are many of them. Huge attention to detail.
3050	My name is Zach in real life....
3051	This recommendation comes with an asterisk. The vanilla PC version of DP is actually kind of disasterous. There are a handful of game breaking bugs and there's no native 1080. Get this game with the DP fix mod and consider getting color correction mods. That aside, this game is bliss. Don't play it if you're one of those 'gameplay is king' people, because honestly the gameplay is mostly inconsequential. However, the script, animations, and overall plot will grab your attention in a way similar to a fantastic B-movie, and it's quite obviously intentional. Swery is like a mixture between Tommy Wiseu, Hideo Kojima, and David Lynch. Cannot recommend this game enough over and above the problems it has.
3052	PC Port is pretty bad, but if you tweak it a bit by going to your Deadly Premonition files located in your Steam folder, right click DP.exe, properties, change the Compaitablity to 98/ME, then go to DPLauncher.exe, and change that to Run as Admin, then launch it through the DPLauncher, it should be fully functioning, aside from the lack of options. Great game. prone to crashes and occasional graphics â¥â¥â¥â¥ ups
3053	Bad PC port. Be prepared to waste an hour figuring out how to install fixes to get it to work at all. Almost unplayable in its normal state.   Once I got it running it had a really trippy japanese horror movie thing going on, but I didn't get very far cause I think it crashed.   
3054	Everything abount this game is horribly broken in all of the best ways. It is the most bizarre yet endearing story I've seen.
3055	Nearly unplayable without the DPfix mod, but it has a lot of quirky charm to it. It's also pretty spooky, and I totally did not expect those feels I felt at the end.
3056	This game is just so terrable its amazing!   It has a uniq story line and good characters! AND YOU CAN GET TOMS BISCUTS!
3057	Just when you think you've seen it all you go sleep in a shack in the woods and wake up to a giant black dog chasing you... A lovable, absurd mess that made me want to rewatch Twin Peaks.  Also it made me hate driving cars. A lot.
3058	A technical clusterâ¥â¥â¥â¥ hiding probably the most unusual and entertaining Twin Peaks fan game i've ever played.
3059	Easily worth the 2,50 when it's on sale.
3060	If you're like me, you'll walk into this game blind. You'll have to fight with technical issues and endure some unpolished gameplay. If you're like me, you'll find yourself loving the characters so much that whatever issues the game has takes a back seat to the experience and you'll want to know what happens next.
3061	This could be the best, worst game you'll ever play. I'd say a controller is required, instead of recommended, and look around for durante's fix, it's not a great port. From the moment you meet York and Zach, to the credits, this game is a roller coaster.  P.S. don't skip on the sidequests, they unlock things such as fast travel
3062	Short review: It's the Donnie Darko of video games.  Long review: A very divisive game -- it's quirky, hopping between tragedy and comedy at the drop of a hat, rife with amusing (and in hindsight meaningful) esoteric movie and music references, awkward jokes and some of the most amazing plot twists I've ever seen in a video game. It references Twin Peaks and Silent Hills quite a bit, but the surreal nature, web of intrigue and bizarre metaphysical discussions that regularly crop up in the game are more like a cross between Donnie Darko, Hot Fuzz and Youth in Revolt.   - Combat: it was added late in development, and wasn't originally planned. It boils down to third-person over-the-shoulder shooting and melee in creepy 'nightmare' levels along with non-combat QTE-smashing chase sequences. Some shooter-enthusiasts might not be impressed, but I actually liked the action levels. You aren't pressed for resources, since you start out with a pistol with infinite ammo and are bound to find unbreakable or infinite ammo weapons along the way. You can't save whenever, but only in certain places (in combat levels, these are safe houses that are pretty few and far between).  - Open World: a large portion of the game is spent in a sim-like open world, like Dead Rising but without the Zombies. You can go fishing, undertake sidequests, look for collectibles, replay combat levels, or just explore (read: fool around and dig up quirks about the NPCs). There is an in-game clock that you have to pay attention to -- the good news is that you can replay chapters in order to do the things you missed the first time around. (The sidequests give good rewards and reveal a lot of fascinating backstory, so they're a definite win in my books.)  - Music and Voice work: The VAs are spot-on. There is a lot of dialogue in this game, and more than a few awkward moments, and the performers do a fantastic job in tackling both, in my opinion. The music is pretty iconic. The soundtrack is limited, but the few melodies and songs that it has are memorable and cathartic.   - Genre: This game is definitely /not/ a survival horror. It is a paranormal mystery and a tragicomedy combined with an open world and shooter mechanics. There are some pretty gruesome moments, perhaps even a few eerie moments, but very little that can be considered proper horror (except perhaps the chase sequences, which will catch you by surprise the first time around).  - Story: There's very little I can say about the story without spoiling it or making it sound like I'm recapping Twin Peaks. Believe me, it is a popular misconception that this game is a copy of Twin Peaks -- it definitely is more than that.  The basic premise is that you play an FBI detective who has a split-personality and specializes in serial killings. He comes to a sleepy, seemingly harmless American townlet where a prom queen's been murd- okay, I've started describing Twin Peaks. You get the picture. Although the game leaves off on a premise that is basically Twin Peaks, it deviates very early on into a multi-layered network of conspiracy that involves the military, demons, and more than one serial killer.   - Technical issues: I haven't encountered many glitches, but due to an unfortunate chain of events that had nearly sent the game to development hell -- events that were beyond the studio's control -- the PC port has a serious issue with memory leaks. My GPU was overheating like crazy, followed by crashes and freezing. I got the situation under control with some fixes and patches, and luckily the memory problem didn't get dire until the last few levels. I recommend playing in windowed mode, and leaving open an app that monitors your GPU temp -- if you have the know-how, I also recommend setting up a more rigorous GPU fan profile.
3063	My coffee warned me about this game. Good coffee.
3064	The pickles...nuff said.
3065	Creepy but fun. Yes.
3066	TLDR  Had to cool off before posting this. It's been about 4-5 months. Was going to thumb this game down almost immediately. But over time I remembered some memorable moments, even though this wasn't the Alan Wake experience I was looking for. I give Double Penetration: The Director's Cut a thumbs up, but with a caveat emptor ... it's considering that nothing UGLY happens (which it most likely will on PC/Steam) ...

The characters truly have a unique personality, you will fall in love with some of them, hate some others, and sometimes you won't know what to think about certain ones (Yes, Thomas and Mrs. 'Pot' I'm talking to you).  The Sountrack is amazing, nostalgic, you will notice its good tunes from the very beginning.  I'm not in love with its Combat System, but after you get caught by the plot, you won't care too much about that.  Deadly Premonition it's one of those games I'll never forget and If you're looking for a good story, charming characters and an awesome soundtrack, Deadly Premonition won't disappoint you.   
3068	The pickles.
3069	You have no idea how bad this port is. I can't even think of another port in recent memory this insanely bad.
3070	It's Twin Peaks, just play it.
3071	This game is... Well, it's certainly something. Ignorant of the infamy of DP's PC port, I happily bought up a game that seemed like it'd take some time to complete, and for like $2.50 no less!  I love it. Simply put, I love this game. York is a humourous and fun character and the way he reacts with the Greenvale citizens is also great. That said this game crashes like CRAZY, even after installing a few mods to fix it. Deadly Premonition is a labour of love, and while I haven't finished it yet it's been worth it so far. I've never played anything like it.
3072	I played this on Xbox360 and beat the game with near 100% completion, that's why I don't have much time played here on steam. Anyways...the game is a masterpiece. It has one of the most interesting stories in a video game I have ever played. It has aliens, the main character talks to a person that is in his head(his other persona), romance, and betrayal. Not to mention silly some of the times with it's own (I find hilarious) sense of humor.   The graphics aren't the best, but they don't need to be, because it's simply fun and thought provoking. Good job whoever brought this game to pc and on steam! Hip hip hurrrrrrrray  10cups of coffee out of 10!   
3073	Did you bring The Picklesâ¢ today, Zach?
3074	I can't recommend this game enough! This is above all my favorite story ever. It's the cheezyest most hilarious best worst thing ever made!
3075	What an Experience I must say. I love story driven games and this one is nothing less than a Gem. If you are familiar with Twin Peaks you could pretty much relate to this story. You are set out to investigate a series of brutal murders that took place in a small hamlet called GreenVale. Be aware that this game is heavily story driven and loaded with Quick Time events while progressing to it. So if you are not fond of that style of gameplay then this game is not for you.  This game has an open-world free roaming approach to it that gives us some freedom of exploration although it fails miserably in rewarding you for doing so. The fact that you have to drive from A to B all the time is dreadful in my opinion and it breaks the momentum.  The game mechanics alternate from Quick time events to a third person shooter and action game which is appreciated actually. The controls are actually poor and most of the time you can't get your aiming straight however it does not punish you for it as it introduces an auto-aim button anyway. The graphics are substandard - I could not care less tough.  Had hours of fun and good laughs with it. It is funny, however it is not cheesy at all. There are a few twists in the plot towards the end. Bottom line is: This is great value for your money.
3076	Its story will get you once you arrive to Greenvale.   The characters truly have a unique personality, you will fall in love with some of them, hate some others, and sometimes you won't know what to think about certain ones (Yes, Thomas and Mrs. 'Pot' I'm talking to you).  The Sountrack is amazing, nostalgic, you will notice its good tunes from the very beginning.  I'm not in love with its Combat System, but after you get caught by the plot, you won't care too much about that.  Deadly Premonition it's one of those games I'll never forget and If you're looking for a good story, charming characters and an awesome soundtrack, Deadly Premonition won't disappoint you.   
3077	So far so good. I love the controls and Twin Peaksy feeling. Maybe filling the gas tank is not necessary.
3078	The version of this classic is HORRIBLE on Steam. However, Over at Good Old Games it retains its charm and delight. Buy it there and not here!
3079	It's Twin Peaks, just play it.
3080	This recommendation comes with an asterisk. The vanilla PC version of DP is actually kind of disasterous. There are a handful of game breaking bugs and there's no native 1080. Get this game with the DP fix mod and consider getting color correction mods. That aside, this game is bliss. Don't play it if you're one of those 'gameplay is king' people, because honestly the gameplay is mostly inconsequential. However, the script, animations, and overall plot will grab your attention in a way similar to a fantastic B-movie, and it's quite obviously intentional. Swery is like a mixture between Tommy Wiseu, Hideo Kojima, and David Lynch. Cannot recommend this game enough over and above the problems it has.
3081	How much to like this game is determined by one question: How much do you like Twin Peaks?  Because if you love David Lynch's show, then you will love everything about Deadly Premontion: Memorable and abstract characters, set in a small town in Washington with gameplay that feels like it was conceived in the Resident Evil 4 era. If you like a good weird experience, you will find it with York and Zach.   HOWEVER...!  Be warned that this is HORRIBLE PC port of an already pretty technically flawed game and it tends to crash. A lot. Your experience might be even worse than mine because I almost completed the main game, but got stuck when the last patch made it pretty much unplayable for me.
3082	Meet Francis 'York' Morgan  FBI Detective by day Fortune teller by night Complete wacko 24/7
3083	My milk told me to buy this game, good that I had coffee in the morning, right Zach ?
3084	An hilarious game, played it about 10 times on the PS3, but now I dont have that, I bought it on PC. Really random game but good story and gameplay. Personally I think its better for PC. There is one bug, but its only when you boot it up it doesnt load, but this can be fixed by going into the game folder and reinstalling DirectX. A must
3085	This is a game you have to appreciate for what it is. It is the tropic thunder of video games. its a spoof of spoofs while spoofing itself and then somehow still is taking itself seriously in regards to the overall story. Its also worth noting that this game is actually a movie in a videogame. There is a universe of movies where the characters in game are really just actors. Spyfiction is one of the other games that is actually a movie in the universe. Forrest (a character in DP) has the same 'actor' as another character in Spyfiction.   But onto the review. So while you get bad repetitive music (which is a joke on purpose and actually kind of catchy) and characters that are laughable yet deviously insidious you find yourself caught in a confusion of emotions regarding the game. It catches you and sucks you in with it's hard to take serious yet super serious dialogue. I played this originalyl on Ps3 and i kept laughing out loud at the game because it was so bad... but then i found myself going to houses and asking questions and being a detective because i needed to know what was happening. The numerous time specific side quests that give more insite that are only found by what would seem to be chance give more back ground and much of the games nuance for the story is missed if you avoid them by accident or lack the ability to find them. And the story is actually so... well i wont give anything away but its WORTH the time and effort and the annoying car noise that is satans fingernails on a chalkboard.
3086	I don't even know how to properly describe this game or how it found its way deep into the cuckles of my black heart but my god is it a tour de force of pure WTF. If you have a pension for the weird and don't mind a terrible port, buy this â¥â¥â¥â¥!
3087	Good game, port needs some love if you want to play it.
3088	Playable?
3089	good game, but it's so japanese its not even funny.
3090	At the technical level, this thing is a travesty, frequent crashes, barebones gameplay that barely functions, visuals that seem to belong on the PS2, a lot of segments that seem to be pretty much filler, and at times the situations make so little sense that it would normally kill all suspension of disbelief, and yet I can't help but love the game, it might sound strange but the game has charm out the â¥â¥â¥, quirky likable characters, a plot that is mostly interesting, even if it times shoots itself in the foot occasionally. But the quirky characters, sheer ambition, attention to small details, and town that in some regards feels more alive than the cities in your typical Open Sandbox game make the game an experience unlike any other, though the original Xbox 360 version might be the best one from what I can gather.
3091	Great, weird and humorous horror, like it should be.
3092	Deadly Premonition is simultaneously godawful and one of the greatest games ever made.
3093	I am honestly very confused by this game. I have no idea if it wants to take itself seriously or not. I can't really give it a description that does justice to how bizarre it all is. There's an FBI agent who solves crimes with the help of his imaginary friend, but you're his imaginary friend... I think? He takes advice from his coffee and the soundtrack likes to play really â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up sax solos when you fail a QTE. It seems like it wants to go for the survival horror angle but is just so weirdly written and presented that it feels more like a parody that loops back around and becomes terrifying in a drug-addled fever dream sort of way.  All I can really say is give it a shot if it can be picked up in a sale for super cheap (like $5 cheap). It's certainly... something.
3094	If you love Twin Peaks and Resident Evil 4, give it a try. Its a unique experience you won't get anywhere else.  Fair warning, install the unofficial patches and be prepared for some bugs, the game is far from technically perfect.
3095	Definitly not for everyone, but if you can look past its flaws and oddities you truely will find something special. (this is also my first review i've ever written so that tells something!!)
3096	Zach, the coffee told me to nominate this game for the 2016 Steam Awards 'Game Within A Game' Award  Sinner's Sandwich/10 would premonition again hurhurhur
3097	Not worth playing much of, but great when it's cheap, and one of the most ridiculous games you'll ever come across, go with the LP though.
3098	This could be the best, worst game you'll ever play. I'd say a controller is required, instead of recommended, and look around for durante's fix, it's not a great port. From the moment you meet York and Zach, to the credits, this game is a roller coaster.  P.S. don't skip on the sidequests, they unlock things such as fast travel
3099	Short review: It's the Donnie Darko of video games.  Long review: A very divisive game -- it's quirky, hopping between tragedy and comedy at the drop of a hat, rife with amusing (and in hindsight meaningful) esoteric movie and music references, awkward jokes and some of the most amazing plot twists I've ever seen in a video game. It references Twin Peaks and Silent Hills quite a bit, but the surreal nature, web of intrigue and bizarre metaphysical discussions that regularly crop up in the game are more like a cross between Donnie Darko, Hot Fuzz and Youth in Revolt.   - Combat: it was added late in development, and wasn't originally planned. It boils down to third-person over-the-shoulder shooting and melee in creepy 'nightmare' levels along with non-combat QTE-smashing chase sequences. Some shooter-enthusiasts might not be impressed, but I actually liked the action levels. You aren't pressed for resources, since you start out with a pistol with infinite ammo and are bound to find unbreakable or infinite ammo weapons along the way. You can't save whenever, but only in certain places (in combat levels, these are safe houses that are pretty few and far between).  - Open World: a large portion of the game is spent in a sim-like open world, like Dead Rising but without the Zombies. You can go fishing, undertake sidequests, look for collectibles, replay combat levels, or just explore (read: fool around and dig up quirks about the NPCs). There is an in-game clock that you have to pay attention to -- the good news is that you can replay chapters in order to do the things you missed the first time around. (The sidequests give good rewards and reveal a lot of fascinating backstory, so they're a definite win in my books.)  - Music and Voice work: The VAs are spot-on. There is a lot of dialogue in this game, and more than a few awkward moments, and the performers do a fantastic job in tackling both, in my opinion. The music is pretty iconic. The soundtrack is limited, but the few melodies and songs that it has are memorable and cathartic.   - Genre: This game is definitely /not/ a survival horror. It is a paranormal mystery and a tragicomedy combined with an open world and shooter mechanics. There are some pretty gruesome moments, perhaps even a few eerie moments, but very little that can be considered proper horror (except perhaps the chase sequences, which will catch you by surprise the first time around).  - Story: There's very little I can say about the story without spoiling it or making it sound like I'm recapping Twin Peaks. Believe me, it is a popular misconception that this game is a copy of Twin Peaks -- it definitely is more than that.  The basic premise is that you play an FBI detective who has a split-personality and specializes in serial killings. He comes to a sleepy, seemingly harmless American townlet where a prom queen's been murd- okay, I've started describing Twin Peaks. You get the picture. Although the game leaves off on a premise that is basically Twin Peaks, it deviates very early on into a multi-layered network of conspiracy that involves the military, demons, and more than one serial killer.   - Technical issues: I haven't encountered many glitches, but due to an unfortunate chain of events that had nearly sent the game to development hell -- events that were beyond the studio's control -- the PC port has a serious issue with memory leaks. My GPU was overheating like crazy, followed by crashes and freezing. I got the situation under control with some fixes and patches, and luckily the memory problem didn't get dire until the last few levels. I recommend playing in windowed mode, and leaving open an app that monitors your GPU temp -- if you have the know-how, I also recommend setting up a more rigorous GPU fan profile.
3100	I have a dream: to see Deadly Premonition remastered.
3101	Not worth playing much of, but great when it's cheap, and one of the most ridiculous games you'll ever come across, go with the LP though.
3102	This is the greatest game ever, isn't it Zach?
3103	Very bad game that's fun; compliments of Swery. What a good game. Gives you more freedom than most of the new games today. 
3104	The coffee! 'Zach, do you remember what the coffee said?'  This game has so much charm. I'm sucked in by the silly, whimsical style. The characters are cheesy and I love it. A lot of the supporting characters are one dimensional and are defined by their quirky traits, and that's okay. The simplicity of these characters adds to the campy feel of the story, which seems to be intended as a parody on the horror genre.   Deadly Premonition is a campy romp through the twisted memories of our protagonist, Francis York Morgan, as he tells a story of his investigation into a peculiar murder case. In this story, Francis finds himself caught between two different worlds, one 'normal,' and one filled with monsters and spooky stuff. He is an unusual character, and as you start to understand who he is, the question nags at you, is he really interacting with this paranormal parallel universe, or is it all simply in his head? As he often talks to a guy in his head and he consults his coffee for advice, you begin to suspect the latter.   The game play feels a little clunky, with its Resident Evil controls and quick time events. Still, I had a lot of fun running around bashing zombies with a pipe, solving clever puzzles, and driving from point to point in a sandbox environment that is the fictional town of Greenvale. The choice to include these driving segments in the game is a strange one, but strange choices are what drive this game to greatness.   8 out of 10 deadlys, would premonition again. 
3105	Its story will get you once you arrive to Greenvale.   The characters truly have a unique personality, you will fall in love with some of them, hate some others, and sometimes you won't know what to think about certain ones (Yes, Thomas and Mrs. 'Pot' I'm talking to you).  The Sountrack is amazing, nostalgic, you will notice its good tunes from the very beginning.  I'm not in love with its Combat System, but after you get caught by the plot, you won't care too much about that.  Deadly Premonition it's one of those games I'll never forget and If you're looking for a good story, charming characters and an awesome soundtrack, Deadly Premonition won't disappoint you.

And the story is actually so... well i wont give anything away but its WORTH the time and effort and the annoying car noise that is satans fingernails on a chalkboard.
3107	Deadly Premonition is one of the weirdest games ever. To give you a good analogy. Imagine if David Lynch wrote a brilliant script and gave it to Tommy Wiseau or Ed Wood to direct, then you would have a movie that would resemble this game. If this sounds like the most awesome movie ever, then you will probably enjoy Deadly Premonition. Ed Wood movies may be terrible, but their entertaining as ****.   Deadly Premonition is the brainchild of Hidetaka 'SWERY' Suehiro. I've read some interviews featuring SWERY and decided that he is completely bat**** insane and yet a genius at the same. This game went through development hell for 6 years and was almost cancelled 4 times. It seems like nobody on the team really knew how to program well, and the game was perhaps too ambitious for it's own good. When the game came out it was a broken mess. The graphics would have been good on the Dreamcast, the controls are so bad it feels like it has to be intentional(seriously, the car controls are so bad you'll have to play it to believe it), the voice acting is usally passible but can be cringe-worthy at times, the animations on the characters are laugable, the repetive yet catchy musical scores come on at the worst possible times, and despite the terrible graphics the game has horrendous performance issues. Apparently SWERY was actually shocked when critics proceeded to rip the game apart.  Despite all the games shortcomings, there were some people who loved it. Some thought the technical issues only added 'so bad it's good' charm of the game. And of course, the plot and writing of this game is brilliant, if not completely insane. It was obviously heavily influenced by the David Lynch's Twin Peaks. Many of the characters, including the main one, are completely bonkers. The main character Francis York Morgan always introduces himself by saying 'I'm Francis York Morgan, but just call me York, that's what everyone always calls me.' He constantly talks to his imaginary friend Zach. He says not to ask him about Zach, that's a 'private matter.' He literally tells his fortune by looking at the milk swirls in his coffee. To give you an idea of how crazy the writing in this game is *tiny spoiler ahead*, there's one part where a guy in a wheelchair with a skull mask and a gask mask on, who talks by whispering rhyming sentences to a translator, orders a bizzare sandwich in a restaurant. This sandwhich happens to be white bread and turkey, with strawberry jam and cereal(which appears to be corn flakes) smeared on top. York comments that this is a sinner's sandwhich, a sandwhich ones makes to punish themselves for their sins. The guy in the wheelchair challenges York to try this sandwich. After York tries it he jumps out of his chair in surprise, saying it's delicious and orders one. The expression on the two women's faces next to him is one of the moments that makes this game a masterpiece. BTW, you need to actually try the sinner's sandwich. I used Publix Italian Bread, Smucker's strawberry jam, deli turkey meat, and cornflakes. Putting the jam and corn flakes on top is ludicrous, so I just flipped the bread over. Surprisingly, it's delicous. I even made a second one after finishing the first one. SWERY says one of his starving college student friends actually made this, because he didn't have any money and those were the only ingredients he had. Too be honest, Americans put cranberry sauce and potato chips on sandwiches, so it's not too much of a stretch.  Slowly, but surely, just like the game NiER, Deadly Premonition gained gained a cult following. It did so for it's amazing writing and 'so bad it's good' gameplay. If you get this game, be aware that it may not even run properly and you might have to finish it by watching a let's play on youTube. SWERY actually apologized for this horrible port. However, there are a ton of fan patches out there to fix the problems. SWERY was flattered that the game had so much support that people would go to these lengths to make it playable. He said he wished he could hire some of the people who fixed his game. It might remind people of another cult game that was broken on release and had to be fixed by fan patches, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines. That also featured terrible gameplay, but a brilliant plot.  Definitely give this game a chance if you're a fan of cult classics. At least watch a let's play on youTube to experience the plot and bizarre characters. SWERY has also created a new game, D4, which is a lot less broken and features characters that are even more insane. Sadly, SWERY's games have failed to make any money(he released D4 on the Xbone and not the PS4 I mean, come on, the only thing Xboners play is Call of Duty), and he has taken some time off to recover from an illness but insists he'll be back. We can only hope. This guy is up there with Eric Wolpaw(Portal, Psychonauts, and Old Man Murray) as one of the industry's best writers, and it would be a shame to lose him.
3108	Creepy but fun. Yes.
3109	My coffee warned me about this game. Good coffee.
3110	twin peaks: the videogame
3111	The game is a pretty good game. Its flawed but a lot of fun. Its especially more fun when you're a fan of Twin Peaks and you can see the inspiration from it. It just added to the game for me. But anyways yeah, the game is pretty fun. Too bad the PC port is garbage 8(
3112	Before you leave a negative review, please play trough the first chapter and apply DPfix by durante. The game itself is pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥ on a technical level (crap graphics, crap animations/lip sync) but it realy begins to shine when the story picks up.   Trust me, this is one of the best games i've ever played and it's definetly worth looking past its obvious flaws.
3113	Probably one of the worst games I've ever played, but I loved every second of it. Don't let the first hour scare you off, gameplay isn't one of Deadly Premonition's strong points. If you like Twin Peaks and don't get frustrated with horrible gamedesign decisions, this is your game.  I also did not encounter any major bugs after 50 hours of playing with the performance mod, but maybe I suffer from False memory syndrom.
3114	Don't let the near unplayability fool you: this game is a true disasterpiece. Ridiculously terrible, terribly entertaining, entertainingly ridiculous.
3115	It's like mix of Twin Peaks, Resident Evil 4, with uglier graphics, insane plot and characters... and it's great. Experience one of a kind, isn't it, Zach?
3116	This game is a meme.
3117	Even though some foibles and abject crashes occur throughout each playthrough, I still highly regard this as an all time personal favorite of mine. It is hard to pinpoint exactly what it is that makes me adore this game so much. Maybe it is the idiosyncratic nature of each character, it might be the alluring soundtrack accompanying the game or it could also be due to all the different anecdotes spread out in the quirky town of Greenvale. It's far from being a perfect game but what it delivers is a memorable taste in your mouth.

3119	I will never forget Francis York Morgan.
3120	Broken, ugly, clunky and prone to crashing.  And yet.. absolutely brilliant.
3121	Nothing is more perfect.
3122	f.k in the coffee do you see it zack  Buy this if you are into David lynch movies. Buy this if you know how walks with fire. buy this if someone is taking you to the black lodge. Buy this with an open mind and low expectation = realised is the best game you ever play   (don't look at the play time I play it on xbox360 )

3124	Don't let the near unplayability fool you: this game is a true disasterpiece. Ridiculously terrible, terribly entertaining, entertainingly ridiculous.
3125	Very bad game that's fun; compliments of Swery. What a good game. Gives you more freedom than most of the new games today. 
3126	On the outside this game is really awkward, but its really easy to get lost in its interesting story and atmosphere
3127	Deadly Premonition is weird. that is true. it's also eerily close in themes and plot to Twin Peaks, a show which the creator of Deadly Premonition claims to have never heard of. The graphics are uncanny valley, the writing seems purposefully enigmatic and strange, and the plot seems right out of an episode of the X-Files while still trying to play itself straight. But these are all reasons why Deadly Premonition is one of the greatest mystery games of all time. Engross yourself in the culture of a small american town as seen through the eyes of a japanese videogame developer. Take control of Agent Francis York Morgan as he reads the future in the clouds of his coffee, and shoots plant zombies while wearing a bright orange suit. Get paid by the goverment for shaving. And most of all, embrace the weird, and you might find yourself seeing the game for the piece of art that it is.
3128	Fantastic quirky, funny, squirrely game. Played it on xbox but was not interested in getting it to run well on pc. Still great though.
3129	If you like the chase and tail missions of GTA, be sure to pick this one up, you'll be spending 9 (!) minutes tailing a car at 25 mph, granted it doesn't crash or you try to open the steam overlay out of boredom (which will make you fail the mission).
3130	Great game, TERRIBLE port. Started out at about 5 FPS (unplayable/slideshow) on a computer that can handle Skyrim and the Arkham games just fine. With all the tricks and fixes you can find on the internet I eventually got it up to around 15 FPS, at which point the game was just barely playable. (First time I ever needed to use target lock with a mouse, though.) Then the first boss showed up. The QTEs were impossible at that low framerate.  Don't be fooled by all the positive reviews: almost all of them are from people who played this game on the XBox, where it actually ran properly. The PC version is a broken mess, and it's almost certainly never going to be fixed. I got it for $6 as part of a Humble Bundle deal, and I feel ripped off.
3131	I love this game.  Completed the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of the ps3 version and although it had is drawbacks it was narrativley stunning.  The PC port is poorly done.  &gt; Locked 720p resolution and unstable framerate, can't even surpass 30fps most of the time.  There is a fix you can get by a very talented individual by the name Durante, which unlocks various options for the game such as resolution, anisotropic filtering, SSAO etc and it makes a huuuge difference.  this is an essential fix if you decide to buy :  http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?p=373   Many people have reported this fix working perfectly and others claim it does improve gfx and lets you set custom resolution but the framerate is still unstable.  My experience was the latter, i have major unstable framerate for the game and my rig can more than handle this game.  I can't recommend the pc version of this game since it requires you to work on it to get it running smoothly, you really shouldn't have to do it after paying money for the game.   Though it pains me to give it the thumbs down i would recommend you play it on the ps3 for a better experience because it really is a great game.
3132	Worst port I've ever played. Constant crashes.
3133	A truely crappy port of a fanstastic game.  I couldn't get past the second combat section in the game without it crashing constantly.  Avoid at all costs.
3134	I'd love to reccomend this game but honestly, It's not very stable, thankfully thanks to mods and unofficial patches it's a little more playable, but honestly, this is a very bad port right out of the gate of a game that was already pretty buggy and had a terrible framerate on the consoles, I guess i'm glad I bought it because I liked it on the consoles and it's a very weird but great game, but I can't reccomend it for people looking for a stable experience out of the gate.
3135	I wish I could give this a positive review, because the game itself it great. But the PC version is nearly unplayable. If you want to play Deadly Premonition (which you should, it's a great game) I'd recommend playing the xbox 360 version if it's available to you. I've tinkered with this game for hours and it still won't work, and it seems the developers have no intention of fixing this version of the game as it's been unplayable for years. I actually bought this when it first came out and gave up in frustration, and now, years later, it's still broken. I have to give this a thumbs down. Sorry.
3136	This game is so buggy that even with DPfix you will run into trouble. Long load times, autosave doesn't work, crash when you enter a building (since autosave doesn't work if you did any side missions tough luck you have to do them again). The game crashed when I was gonna enter a critical mission building and I did some side missions before. The developers even acknoledged DPfix and said to install it rather than actually putting a patch themselves. And now they are on the front cause of Recently updated but they didn't update the game it's just on sale. Don't let these companies get away with lazy ports.
3137	Really wanted to play Deadly Premonition.  Everytime I launch the game it crashes immediately. Tons of problems with the port after that.  Very disappointed.  Edit: After installing DPfix, changing the compatibility to Windows XP, nearly â¥â¥â¥â¥ing my OS, and uninstalling VLC and MPC-HC, I finally got the game to work. Still not recommending because I don't really want anyone else to go through all that bull â¥â¥â¥â¥.
3138	The actual game itself gets a wholehearted recommendation. Though the gameplay is certainly rough around the edges--to say the least--there's an immense amount of charm, humor, and Lynch-esque eccentricities found in the fictional town of Greenvale. Deadly Premonition was never a 'so bad it's good' game, but rather a genuinely good experience saddled with a low budget and a couple of design pitfalls. The main issues lie in the combat. The game's director SWERY65 has been on the record stating that the 'shooting bits' were not actually a part of the game's original concept. The combat was the last part of the game developed in what seems to be an effort to give the game a broader audience appeal. And it shows. Killing enemies in this game is by no means a dreadful or broken experience, it's just a very barebones and arguably pointless affair--some shallow padding until you reach the next chunk of entertaining story exposition and exploration of the game's quirky world. I'd argue that most people played the Dreamcast classic Shenmue for the exploration, character interaction and investigation segments rather than the just-OK fighting-game showpieces sprinkled throughout. As it follows in Shenmue's footsteps in many ways, Deadly Premonition should be treated in the same regard. Do enjoy the warmth that Greenvale has to offer.  If you can.  The lack of resolutions higher than 720p in this PC port have already been discussed and criticized--and then fixed, by the same dude who made the Dark Souls PC fix. DPFix, however, does not fix the lackluster native controller support and constant crashing. You can go find additional third-party mapping software of course, but as this is originally a console game and advertises controller support on the Steam store page, the exclusion is a bit disappointing. The crashing, on the other hand, is not as immediately remedied. It seems very temperamental and varies from system to system, but across my two Windows 7 and XP machines I've had nothing but instability. I have tried putting the .exe in Windows 98 compatability, numerous restarts, and other tweaks found from various discussion threads. But the game still crashes at the worst, most pivotal moments (like before I can get to a save point) or slows down to an unplayable framerate. The framerate is momentarily fixed by a full system reboot, but the sluggishness and screeching halts always return again and again. I've never seen this kind of thing happen in any other game.  So in a bit of frustration and resignation, I've uninstalled this game and returned to finish the original, Xbox 360 version. But I feel like I'm missing out on the definitive experience. The Director's Cut provides some nice touch-ups, like a better map system, less washed-out graphics, marginally improved driving controls, some extra cutscenes, and an easier default difficulty setting, which basically lowers the sometimes ridiculously high health bars on the various enemies throughout the game. Though there's much talk these days about the dumbing down of modern games--that they're too easy--I can assure you that toning down the frustration in this game is definitely a good thing. Anyone who has spent 30 minutes killing one of the 'wall-crawler' enemies in the 360 version should be able to attest. It's attrition, a hurdle, not a fair and invigorating challenge by any means.   Some people have been able to play this port to completion, sidequests and all. Maybe you're one of them, maybe not. Maybe in a year (or more), the game will be patched up and as nice as the Dark Souls port. Until then, I consider this game an Xbox 360 exclusive (the Playstation 3 Director's Cut port is even worse than the PC version, don't touch it please!).  Buy this port if you like a gamble, Zach.
3139	Don't even bother. Horrible port, controller doesn't work (xbox 360), frame rate issues are constant (even after the proposed restart your computer fix). 1920X1080 need a fix to work...   I have a decent computer so i don't see that my pc is causing the horrible frame rate issues ( i have a i5 4670 and a r9 290). Can't even get past firs part of the game since the QTE are related to your frame rate, so even if i try to be as fast as i can i get killed.  Alot of dissapointment, really wanted to play this game.
3140	It's a game I really want to like - just wish it didn't crash all the god damn time
3141	As much as I love the original (it remains to this day one of my favorite games of all time) the sloppy control port here makes the game nigh unplayable. I highly reccommend getting the 360 orignal instead.
3142	I would love to recommend this game, really I would. It has a really nice plot, the minigames are suprisingly fun, the shooting action, while stiff and rather easy, feels pretty rewarding. It plays almost as a homage to Twin Peaks with a little bit of Silent Hill thrown in for good measure, and I absolutely oved it for all of its flaws (it even got me into Twin Peaks)... until the game would not let me pass through a certain point because of a gamebreaking glitch involving the time. And I couldn't go back because there's only one save slot.  The truth is this pretty damn good game can be downright unplayable because of the number of glitches and bugs that just seem to absolutely ruin the game. I'm not talking small things like stiff animation and bad lighting, I'm talking glitches that can literally mean you must restart your game or your computer in order to move on... or have to start from the very beginning. I cannot, in any good heart, recommend this game because it has terrible memory leaks that usually cause the game to crash after about an hour or so. When it isn't that, it is a game glitch that I have read is linked to the in-game clock. In a word, if you're outside at exactly the wrong time, the game will crash to desktop until you smoke to let the time pass ('smoking' in Deadly Premonition is akin to waiting in Skyrim/Fallout/Oblivion, except it requires an item) until the next day or until the crash no longer exists. If you've SAVED outside or if you do not have smokes or enough supplies to last until after you smoke, then you're screwed and you MUST restart your game. If this game had multiple save slots, it could be salvaged by saving in multiple slots, but sadly it does not. Sometimes, I have heard that running the game as administrator or setting compatibility mode can fix these bugs, it is not a sure thing for every player. The game, for as good as it is, is broken.  If you're still willing to try this game, and I wouldn't necessarily recommend against that, you should DEFINITELY be sure to back up your saves whenever it is convienent for you (at least every time you exit the game). You can do this by going to the game directory on Steam and going to the 'savedata' folder. If you can remember to do that, and if you're patient, then you should not have any major problems with it.  Barring that, the game is also a pretty bad PC port with very limited graphics options right off the bat. Thankfully, at least for the graphical options, DPFix exists and allows you to change resolution, allows you to alter antialiasing, DOF, etc. It also allows you to change textures and models, allowing for the game to actually enjoy limited modding capability. Related to that, the controls are rather stiff outside a controller, but, for me personally, I could get used to them. If you're not a fan of them, I'd probably get a controller if you can. The controls, from what I have heard, are still not very good on controllers, but they're at least better.  However, if you can get past all of that, the game is a whole lot of good. Voiceovers, especially for a budget game such as this, are actually quite good, although the translation can be a bit stiff at times in the subtitles. The characters, too, are quite memorable, if not stereotypical (although that's pretty much intended). The main character, Agent Francis York Morgan, is actually fleshed out very well as a quirky and sometimes downright schizophrenic special agent for the FBI. Think of Agent Cooper from Twin Peaks except downright crazy sometimes. Dialog is really where the game shines, with very strange characters you can talk to. The game, even though its a horror game at its core, can be very funny with some of the things the characters do and say.  The minigames are actually quite a nice touch to the game. The game's spin on darts is actually kind of interesting, but a bit too easy sometimes if you understand the game. Fishing is a bit boring, but straightforward. Racing is a bit tedious sometimes because of the stiff controls but can still be kind of fun. There are a few other fun bits-and-bobs too, like drinking coffee, that do add to the immersion of the game.  The more horror-related parts of the game, including the shooting sections, can be quite disappointing at times, but other times they can actually be really suspenseful (most definitely including some of the times you encounter one of the antagonists of the game, although I won't spoil more than that). The shooting itself is quite stiff, but sometimes getting a headshot can feel quite rewarding. The enemies are not incredibly interesting or difficult, but can get you unexpectedly at points. However, I will concede that I am a bit biased on this as I have had trouble getting past the 9th chapter for the reasons listed above. You may want to check other reviews for views on this specifically.  The game is open world, although it is not entirely open world like Grand Theft Auto or Far Cry (e.g. you can't go in some of the forests and in specific places). The locations, too, are sometimes a bit vanilla at least as far as exteriors go (the lumbermill, for example, does not look very run down from the outside, especially the bunks and the streets). Exploration isn't a huge deal with this game, although it does exist. Driving also is very stiff and not incredibly exciting, but it gets the job done. A lot of the problems with driving, though, stem from the controls, as stated before.  Sidequests can be hit or miss, in my experience, depending on the quest. Some of them are either fetch quests that don't really have any interesting spin on them (e.g. [MINOR SPOILER] the sherriff's first quest [END MINOR SPOILER]) or really, not even that much of quests at all. However, there are some that do require some detective work and actually do add quite a lot to the game. Definitely worth playing through them, though, in my opinion.  To wrap this review up and summarize the main points:  [CON] The game is incredibly gamebreakingly buggy in some points, with memory leaks that can cause frequent crashing or gamebreaking must-restart-the-game crashes that require you to start again. No extra save slots which causes the latter type of glitches to require a hard restart if you do not manually restart your game.  [CON] Bad PC port with very few graphics options out of the box and poor, stiff controls.  [CON] Shooting, driving, and open-world mechanics aren't the best, although they have their redeeming qualities   [PRO] DPFix can fix graphical and control-related problems to a degrees, and allows for minor moddablity to the game.  [PRO] Very good plot with incredibly interesting characters. The voiceovers, for the most part, are pretty good too  [PRO] Can be very suspenseful at some points and actually cashes in fairly well on being a horror game  [PRO] Decent sidequests and minigames   All in all, for most people, I simply cannot recommend this game to most people in general because the game is very, very, very unstable and very prone to bad glitches and crashes. However, if you're willing to accept its flaws and can be sure to back up your saves incredibly often, then maybe Deadly Premonition is the game for you.
3143	it's fantastic until you reach the part where you literally can't play the game because it crashes without any fixes that seem to work and you should probably just buy the xbox or ps3 version instead
3144	Won't even start up on PC. Fantastic game if you can play it on a platform that works. Avoid the PC version.
3145	While I enjoy the story of this game I cannot overlook the constant crashes and bugs that abound in this poorly ported title, especially given the $25 USD price tag.   My game freezes about 5-10% of the time when checking side quests. Random freezing during loading screens. Performance issues on a beefy rig when running windowed. Unable to interact with required doors/objects during certian missions.  Issues while driving that cause my tires to sink into the road bringing my car to a sudden stop.   Also, this game is locked to 720p which can be fixed with the dpfix mod but installing that brought about an issue where the game freezes when I tab out.   If my friend did not want to watch me stream this game I would have already deleted it within the first hour of gameplay.   TL;DR : Great story, amusing characters in this Twin Peaks inspired game but bugs and crashes make the game nearly unplayable. Not worth the price. 3/10
3146	The PC port is a nightmare. I've tried just about everything - and I mean   everything   - to get this game running. Probably the most hilarious fix I've found has you going on a mini purge of all third party video software, uninstalling LAV filters and setting Windows Media Player as the default app for video files (because y'know, apprarently that works sometimes!?). Unfortunately, like every other fix, it had no effect on my system.   Nobody should be jumping through this many hoops just to get their game running. When the desperation is so bad that the only option is to start deleting other programs from your system,   something is seriously wrong.  
3147	I am telling you Zach, this is a conspiracy . An internet wide conspiracy zach - to convince innocent agents like you deadly premonitions is somehow worth their time . But they are lying to us , Zach . Your life is too short to spend so many hours figuring out how to make the game not crash at lunch Zach. Your backlog is too long to waste so many hours of your life restarting your computer because the game locked up at random . And the inventory Zach , the inventory menu is a death trap - it will freeze your game , always and forever Zach , without fail. All your quirks and weird tonal shifts can be enjoyed in LP form, without the frustrating hurdle of trying to play it zach .
3148	This is a tough thing for me to do, given that Deadly Premonition is one of my favorite games I've ever played, but I can't honestly recommend playing this version of the game. I first played Deadly Premonition on the Xbox 360, and that version had its issues, of course, but it at least functioned out of the box. I installed the latest version of DPfix (0.9.5 as of this writing), and that helped, but it didn't fix the constant runtime errors that would pop up during gameplay, causing the game to stop functioning. Usually they'd pop up after an hour or so of gameplay, but sometimes later (if I was lucky), or sometimes much sooner (if I was unlucky).  Even if this version wasn't completely unstable, I still wouldn't recommend playing this over the 360 version. While this is the 'Director's Cut', the story by and large is exactly the same, with the exception of a few added cutscenes at the beginning/end of each episode. The storyline is perfectly capable of standing on its own without these added scenes, so playing this version of the game just for them (especially if you've played the original game before) is not worth it. If one really wanted to see them, I'd recommend viewing them on a video site, rather than playing through this version for the sake of seeing them.  There are some other things regarding the game design that have been changed; most notably the controls. The original game featured Resident Evil 4-style movement, in that moving up or down would move your character forward or backward, while moving left or right would turn your character in those directions; camera remaining behind your shoulder the whole time. There were also some parts of the game (very few; only a small handful) where the normally over-the-shoulder camera would switch to a completely different angle, again reminiscent of Resident Evil (in this case, the classic horror-style games). One complaint the original game did receive had to do with these controls, so in the Director's Cut you can instead move in any direction, while moving the camera completely independently of your character. As far as basic maneuverability is concerned, this is an improvement, though I would argue it's not really necessary, as the original game's movement controls were just fine, if not entirely self-explanatory. The aiming and shooting mechanics are virtually untouched in the Director's Cut, aside from moving aiming control to the right analog stick (if you're playing with a controller). You still have to stand in place to aim and shoot, so this aspect of the controls remains faithful to the original. Whether you consider that a drawback or not will depend on your preferences.  While general movement is improved by the new controls, I think keeping full control of the camera during every moment of gameplay was a bad change to make. This is most apparent in one of the side quests, in which you push boxes around a maze. This puzzle-like gameplay was shown from an overhead view in the original game, but here in the Director's Cut, the camera is moved closer to your character, as if you were in a normal area. This makes trying to solve this block puzzle unnecessarily much harder to do, as you can no longer see the entire playing field; thus making it much more likely that one will make a mistake, and thus have to restart the block puzzle from the beginning. This was much less of a hassle to complete in the original game. There are also some other scenes which originally had fixed-camera perspectives, yet now don't. These other scenes' original perspectives aren't nearly as important as the block puzzle's, but this was still a change that added nothing to the game.  This is a relatively minor change, but the green tint the original game had was removed in this version. This doesn't really affect the game that much; the graphics are mostly identical otherwise, and if you've never played the original game, you won't find yourself missing it. I personally miss the green tint, as I felt it helped add to the atmosphere, but I wouldn't consider its removal a deal-breaker on its own. The only other significant addition to the game is some bonus features, such as alternate outfits for certain characters to wear, as well as a house in town for the main character to rest at. This, again, is unnecessary, and the fact that time and effort was spent on frivolous things such as this, as opposed to fixing any of the graphical deficiencies in the game, or refining the level and quest designs, or even fixing some translation errors in the text or bugs that the original game had, is disappointing. The original Deadly Premonition was a pretty unpolished, buggy game, and this retains all of the bugs that version had, while introducing several new ones of its own. Over three years passed between the release of the original game, and the release of the Director's Cut on the PS3, followed soon after by this PC port. Were the developers really not able to fix any of these problems during all this time; not even the grammatical/spelling errors that are prevalent throughout the game's text?  It hurts me to write this, because at its core Deadly Premonition is a game I truly care about. Its story (which I won't go into detail about at all, as it's one that should ideally be experienced with as few spoilers as possible) is incredibly compelling and well-written, managing to mix multiple themes and moods in a way that fits well together; after my first time beating the original game, I found myself reflecting on the game's events and characters time and time again. Every character in this game is incredibly memorable, and the majority of the work by the game's voice actors is very well done. The actual gameplay itself... has its ups and downs. The game's world is very interesting and has a number of secrets to be found, as well as multiple unique characters who maintain their own schedules and lives as the game progresses, somewhat similar to The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. The sidequests are mostly good, and stand out from each other pretty well, while at times giving essential rewards for completing them.  The game's combat is often derided, which is understandable. Most of the combat areas in the game are terribly designed, being repetitive, dull, and often way too long for their own good. It's as if the developers spent most of their time on the main storyline and sidequests, and rushed to include some combat areas at the last minute, having absolutely no time to playtest them. As with many other things, none of this is changed in the Director's Cut; if you hated the combat in the original game, that's still an issue here. All I can recommend to deal with it is doing certain sidequests as soon as possible, and using their rewards to help make the combat less tedious.  To sum things up, Deadly Premonition is a very unique, memorable experience; one that as of now, I feel is best had on the Xbox 360. If Deadly Premonition seems like a game you really want to experience, and you have a 360, I recommend searching out a used copy of that version instead, and afterward (if you feel like it) watching the extra cutscenes online. If you have a PS3... I haven't played that version myself, but from what I have read online it at least doesn't crash after every hour of play. If neither of these platforms are available to you, and you absolutely have to play this game, well... then you might want to take a chance on this PC version; preferably during a sale. Remember to download the latest version of Durante's DPfix prior to playing, and make sure to save as much as possible, lest you lose your recent progress due to a crash. Also back up your saves often; fortunately they're easily accessible in their own folder inside the game's files. While it didn't happen to me, thankfully, I have read about instances where other players' save data was corrupted, forcing them to start over. With that in mind, enjoy at your own risk.
3149	This port is basically broken and frequently hangs and freezes at random, even after fixing the broken PhysX install the game comes with. Don't bother and just get the console version instead (I only paid $2.50 for it and still feel ripped off).
3150	If you can get it on sale or cheap, this might be ok. However, charging 30 Euro for this is overpriced.  Technical problems: - Crashes and bugs here and there - Clunky controls - A fixed 720p 16:9 resolution; there is a mod that changes that, but that will give you more chrashes  While I am accustomed to clunky controls for console ports, the fixed resolution and the crashes are not acceptable.  This game tries to be so much at once, it ends up being not good at anything particular:  - It tries to tell a story, but that story is weird and has too many turnarounds and arbitrary events. Even after the story is finished, you could still turn it around again and no one would mind. - It tries to be a detective game, but it fails, most detective work is embedded into the story and there is not that much you can do wrong. Lots of suspects, but you don't choose the trail you want to follow, the main mission just guards you through - It tries to be open world GTA driving around, but fails due to extremely clunky driving, unusable map, and chrashes if you go somewhere where the game didn't expect you to go. - It tries to simulate real world needs: You have to eat and to sleep and to shave from time to time. But it fails: You cannot to go to the toilet, you cannot wash yourself (just the clothes), etc. - It tries to be Resident Evil, but it fails in its mediocre clunkiness and boring repetitions, including stupid quick time events - It tries to be episodic, but doesn't make sense there at all. Episodes 1 to 3 take forever, eposides 4-7 are rather short and should just have been episode 4 if it was ment to be comparable - It tries to incorporate psychological elements into the game, but fails miserably. Nearly all characters have psychological problems galore, they just stacked probably everything they thought they heard about psychosis and mutiple personalities. You will meet more psychopaths laden with stories from their childhoods in the small town of this game than in an average psychiatry of a very big city.  - On top of that all: It unnessessary slows down action and progress by long loading times, unskippable intro (which is a problem due to the many chrashes), opening doors very slowly, etc.  The store page tells 'Part suspense-filled horror, part action-adventure game, Deadly Premonition offers an open-world experience packed with locals to meet and places to discover, as well as numerous side quests and mini-games (...)'. Describes the game well: They threw together lots of things, all of them at mediocre quality and rather early-access-like than finished. So the customer ends up holding a mixed bag of everything a little bit in his hands, but nothing really usable. Just like someone added every spice available in his kitchen to some food, hoping for it to become tasty. Most times, it won't.  To sum it up, and to cite the main characters himself: 'Zach, this is a waste of time!'. Yes, it is, it kills quite some time playing it, always at the border between quitting due to all it's clunkiness but still providing something that makes you want to continue in the hope of it becoming more enjoyable, which sadly does not happen.
3151	Terrible port, stay the hell away until it's done properly.
3152	Game is Unplayable!! A total waste of money and time. Be warned do not buy, after you download and try to run the game it immediately crashes. I give this game 0.1 out of 10
3153	I've not played a pc game as crash prone or broken since the original unpatched s.t.a.l.k.e.r.  Even with all the fixes and remedies you're going to need some luck to get through it.  I suggest just getting the console version even though that version isn't exactly stable neither but it's at least playable in some respects.   Only because how poor the original console version does this game actually gets excused from being the worst pc port ever.
3154	It pains me to not recommend this game but you can't look past the technical issues. Even if you get Durante's excellent DPFix mod it's hit and miss whether the game will actually run decently for you, if at all. After much trial and error I managed to get it running but after 30-40 mins of playtime the FPS grinds to a halt and needs a game restart to get it smooth again.  What a shame, the game deserves better.
3155	**Speaking for the game itself 9/10, Just awesome !**  With that being said, I tried 4 different computers with every fix available and can't get this working at all. How is something this bad allowed to be released? I recommend staying away from this one all together. So if your thinking: 'Hey, it can't be that bad, and the price is good, why not try it'? Your wrong and it won't work and you'll be mad!  I have 17.8hrs Gameplay and not one achievement so I think that speaks for itself.
3156	Pain you will suffer thru crashes and glitches Look online for Durante's DP fixes Always be vigilant and save when you can You never know if you'll have to do it again  Many hours I have lost, if you ask me Exceptional story, nostalgic and nasty  ...so says Mr. Stewart
3157	Deadly Premonition is a game you need to play, For Director's Cut on PC, though, you should not pay. So says Mr. Stewart.  Deadly Premonition is one of my absolute favorite games. The Director's Cut, however, and especially the PC version are something to avoid.  Deadly Premonition was a flawed, but amazing game full of charming personality with every of it's lots of characters. What it needed is some additional polish, some rebalancing, some QTE removal. Ideally an engine port to make the world feel even more complete by removing the loading screens or at least making them less frequent. It needed something that will make the original strange beauty preserved for generations to come.  Instead it got The Director's Cut. A version that is worse in pretty much every regard. With slightly better visuals in some parts, worse in all others. With all the game breaking and lighter glitches, typos, mistranslations and other issues intact. With next to no changes to actual issues. With one non-issue made better (the controls). With pointless DLCs. With horribly voiced and animated new cutscenes that break the flow of the story, spoil things and add nothing of value. And, especially on PC, with countless crashes. Crashes that you cannot avoid no matter what you do, just make them slightly less frequent.  If you can, find the original for 360, play that instead. If you absolutely must play Director's Cut, do it on consoles. But this version? This version is the one to avoid at all cost. It will ruin the game for you. And the game is very much worth it.  P.S. Bonus video review:        Revisiting Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut&nbsp;
3158	Looked like a decent game. I wouldn't know, though, because whenever I try to run it, I click 'play' and there is an error telling me 'dp.exe has stopped working. A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available.' This is the only game that has this problem.  Oh, and the time (69 minutes) I spent 'playing' the game was me trying to get it to actually start.
3159	The game itself might be interesting, but this is an awful port.  I have no problem getting smooth framerates in games like Borderlands 2 or Far Cry 3, but here, I got a slideshow of between 5 and 10 FPS even when nothing was happening on the screen. The resolution cannot be changed. When windowed, the game has problems with cursor locking. Camera is awkward.  Not recommended.
3160	Either it'll run or it won't and no fiddling's going to change that.  Don't gamble and just get it on 360 or PS3
3161	Full controller support is not accurate. Xbox 360 controller works fine for every other game with controller support, but can not even move when I try to use it for this game. I googled it and apparently this is a big problem that still has not been fixed.
3162	It's last day of year 2015 and it's still impossible to make this game work. My whole gameplay time counted by Steam is accumulated from unsuccessful launch attempts. Yes. I tried to launch this game for more than 5 hours. I tried unofficial fix, every â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ tip, every â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ guide. I followed every solution I could google, and boy, I reached end of internet thanks to that. At this point it would be easier for me to write this game from scratch. Happy New Year to you scrublords from Access Games and ToyBox Inc. Happy New Year to you, Hidetaka Suehiro, you hack and fraud.  Rot in hell.
3163	Bought the game for â¬ 2,49, thinking to myself I can't do something wrong for that price.  Actually, the story and the characters of the game are quite good (as far as I know it by now), but there are so many technical issues, that I can't recommend the game to anyone. It just will end in frustration.  At first, you have to use some 'trick' to get it started at all. Then you will have crashes every now and then, which have nothing to do with the hardware (my PC fulfills all requirements by far).  My personal 'I won't play this anymore'-moment is that some crash just destroyed a save game. So I played 12 hours only to recognize, that I can start all over again and I have no guarantee, that the game won't destroy another save game on my second try to finish this game.
3164	I love this game so much and I yearn for it to fall into my tender loving arms so I can cradle it like a little baby and give it my total loving care.   But it is not to be...  And you know why that is? Because of the absolutely preposterous port which makes the game practically unplayable - yes I know, you've heard it all before.   I started playing this game a few months back, and couldn't get past a particular cut scene (I'm sure some of the less fortuitous people such as myself know what I'm talking about); and 7 months later - after waiting for a patch of some description - it's still broken.   Yes, I do use DP.Fix, but to no avail.  This is an example of how a game should NOT be on a computer, which is darn shame because I really love Deadly Premonition, and on any other system I'd give it an instant thumbs up.   Consoles, I'm afraid you win this point.  [If I manage to fix my game-breaking bug then I'll be sure to update the review - doubt it'd change my recommendation though]
3165	This game is one of the worst ports I've ever seen. It's nearly unplayable, even with the DPfix installed. It crashes randomly so I had to replay parts of my missions several times. That remains only fun for so long. After the crashes the game suffered from terrible slowdowns, most likely related to a memory leak. I can only take so much before I get frustrated and stop playing. Deadly Premonition is one of the few games I will never take a look at again. And that's disappointing, because I usually love mysterious stories and Resident Evil styled gameplay. But please note: the game is slow gameplay wise: with every door you open, every car you enter, everything you climb on the game will trigger an animation. Boring... And it removes you from the experience at the same time.   I can hardly recommend this because of the poor port, but as a game it's not all that terrible. Heck, it can sometimes even be enjoyable. Provided that it works...  [Rating: 65/100]
3166	nope, dont buy it til they fix the crashing issues, and fix the fact that this game is a pain in the a** to get working in the first place.  booting the game you get an endless intro loop. gotta do a bunch of stuff to get it to work. during the endless loop you cant skip, you cant get to the main menu. you can only close the game. the loop just plays over and over and over.  if you get passed the intro loop..... the start of the game runs fine, but once you get into town and out of the first building, NOTHING BUT CRASHES!  very irritating. drive around crash, walk around, crash, get in car, crash, get out of car, crash....start up game and just barely start, crash.  this needs a patch.  a great game though, but unplayable. the crashes are random and often.  dont buy this til they patch it which doesn't seem likely.
3167	I really like Deadly Premonition. Itâs quirky, strange, and full of enjoyable characters. I had a great time playing through it on the Xbox 360 some time ago and was eager for another play through. Unfortunately, the PC version is a terrible mess. The game crashes frequently and load times are horrendous. Eventually, the bugs and consistently terrible loads caused me to abandon the game. I wish I could recommend the game but itâs just too bad that just doesnât work.
3168	Mr. Francis York Morgan,  Should you know, this game is surreal. Though, what you see now has a tarnished appeal.  'Such poor optimization!' one would declare. If you want the real deal, you should try it elsewhere.  So says, Mr. Stewart.
3169	This game simply doesn't work on PC. Only a few could play it through because of DPfix (or even DSfix), but nonetheless this is utter sh*t. Do yourself a favor and just go watch youtube if you wanna know the story but just DON't pay any penny for this. DOES. NOT. WORK. Crashes everywhere. DON't. Just don't.
3170	I have heard this game talked up for ages and wanted to play it for years. It finally comes on steam and is one of the worst most unplayable piles I have ever seen. I can't even get past the first area because the game decides I want to delete my melee weapon and can't break down a fence now. This port is utter garbage and a total scam that the publishers offload unto steam. As they are publishers they do not have any QA or vetting process restrictions and can drop whatever scum they want directly unto steam and clog up the store with shovelware.   I have given this game a few tries just to get it to even run and now I can't get the control pad to actually do anything when I play. Total rip off.
3171	Terrible port of a game that I might've been able to enjoy but couldn't due to crashing, get it when it's on sale or something if you really are looking to buy it otherwise I'd avoid it if I were you.
3172	i wish i could get it to work   
3173	Bad Port. Bad controls. Bad graphics. Crashes. Controller does not work.
3174	I had a very hard time thinking of how to review this game. There is no  'yes'  or  'no'  for this game. Hell even if steam had it there isn't even a  'neutral'  or  'maybe' . There is simply an   'I don't know' . So this game has what I think is an interesting story line but it is done very poorly. It has bad graphics, glitches, and it crashed a lot for me and others at points in the game (though I think someone  MAY  have made a mod to fix this, I never checked.) to the point where I couldn't see the epilogue because it crashed every time I tried but there is still something appealing about this game I can't explain well. The core story is very interesting. The only problem is that this game could have been much better if they took out the bad combat system and spent the money on other parts. Not being able to change the resolution and the 'DP.exe has stopped working' though are the big part for me.  That being said I will still re-play it some day because I still like the story. As for anyone who wants to buy this game, You have to be aware that it doesn't feel good and have to go in with low expectations to enjoy it's random storyline. I guess that's the best way to put it. I would give it a...uhh...to be realistic 5.5/10 but I'm still not 100% sure how to rate it. You'll just have to buy the game when it's on sale as long as you can live with what the problems I stated to understand why this game is so good-bad. Though this game is a port and doesn't seem to crash or have most these problems on console so it may be worth buying it on an xbox than on steam.
3175	This game is hella fun, especially as a Twin Peaks Fan, but after 8 hours it keeps crashing.
3176	Fire weep with me  This port is a catastrophe
3177	Deadly Premonition is a fantastic game that I would not recommend to anyone.   Many comparisons can be made about Deadly Premonition - I myself found the combat to play like RE4, the overworld to faintly remind me of Psychonauts, the time-based mission structure to resemble Dead Rising's own (although major difference being in Deadly Premonition you can just ignore the time restraints and be none the worse) and even the mechanically-driven story setpieces to remind me of Metal Gear Solid's storytelling methods. The near Frankenstein nature of this mish-mash of tones and mechanics will undoubtedly remind you of many products too.   It's not remotely a serious game, though it does have its serious moments and it benefits heavily from them. The much-touted awful combat becomes merely mediocre if you play it with a gamepad - and you should play it with one. The characters are interesting, the dialogue is brilliant, the story is exactly as mysterious as it tries to be (though in no small part due to its poorly-veiled source material) and even the art direction is consistent and visually appealing, graphical glitches and some aging NPC models aside.  The point is that many people have recommended Deadly Premonition on the basis that 'it's so bad it's good'. This isn't true. Deadly Premonition is a geuininely good game that has won a cult following despite its shortcomings - I fought tooth and nail to fully complete it simply because I enjoyed it.  But I wouldn't recommend that you play it, because I can't be sure you can.  It took me a good 45 minutes just to get it to start without crashing. Beyond that I was fighting through runtime errors, outright crashes, even the odd Blue Screen of Death - any moment in the game that had me go longer than 20 minutes without a save point was a nerve-wracking nightmare. These aren't some faintly annoying bugs and this game is infamous for its port for a good reason. Right up until the very end my playthrough was plagued by some unseen demon.  For the technologically savvy there is a unique and memorable gem here that has been sadly soiled by its monstrous technical issues. For everyone else, move on. Watch a playthrough on Youtube because it really is worth experiencing, even if second-hand.
3178	Even with numerous fixes and unofficial patches it still crashes very frequently, leaving you frustrated over the fact that the previous checkpoint was 30 minutes ago.  If you are willing to suffer through that, you're probably going to like the game, which is quite original.
3179	When I played for the first time Dark Souls, I thought 'Well, that's the Worst Port In History, I'll never find something like this again'   I was wrong.   Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut is even worse, locked at 720p, tons of crashes, control system oh...  Anyway, the plot is really nice and the location is cool too.   I recommend this game only if bought in a bundle.
3180	My coffee warned me about this game but i bought it anyway. Stay away from this game it is an unfinished optimization business. Shame on you â¥â¥â¥â¥in developers.
3181	Thiss need a fix. I just wanna play this game :/
3182	I really enjoyed this game on the 360 so when my box red ringed I was excited to pick it up on PC so I could actually finish it. That was not the case. This port is sooo broken. It crashes very very often and, since the game uses save points, it is likely you will be unable to progress. If you are thinking of purchasing this then check the forums first to see if a patch has been released. As of now, there are too many stability issues.
3183	I was interested in this game because it has many fans and was supposedly good. What I expected is a detective game with paranormal twist, like Murdered: Soul Suspect. Long story short, it is not even close and fails in almost every aspect. Usually I leae positive reviews, but this game is really poor.  The gameplay is really boring, almost every part of it feels like a filler, leaving nothing interesting or captivating in the end. The game consists of several 'activities':  1) Zombie shooter. It's very consolish (no wonder here), you walk around, shoot zombies in the head, collect weapons they sometimes drop and other items like coffee (any item is highlighted by bubbles visible a mile away). In certain rooms you can access your toolbox (an extra inventory, very gamey), save, sleep or change your suit (what for??? it's completely pointless).  2) QTE sequences. They are brutal. You have less than a second to press a needed button, and there are several in a row. How about mash A and D - Q - R - mouse left click - E? The only way to succed is to die several times before you learn the entire sequence beforehand.  3) Roaming around the town to get some quests that should earn you better weapons or some other stuff. Thankfully its optional because this is one of the most boring things I've ever saw in a game - bland town, bland streets, bland graphics. It's like a very poor attempt of a GTA clone. Another filler to extend the gameplay time IMHO. A side quest I completed consisted of finding a sports equipment lost in a police station for a police boss... fascinating!!! :)  4) Watch long cutscenes with conversations. They are really weird. All characters lines, models and animations are so bland I couldn't believe it. You get a cop which is like a dumbest cops from all police movies combined. You get a police chick obviously interested in protagonist. You get a farmer which is ye olde standard farmer, salt of the earth. There are two kawai small boys who are like angels. And there is a main protagonist - yep, he is FBI agent with paranormal abilities! This is so new, wow, how could they invented that???! The entire game is like they took a standard B movie characters from 100 poorest movies of all time and made them even simpler than they were. It's hard to explain, but the entire story and characters feels like a caricature.  So a typical story mission consists of speaking with your police buddies (with long pauses and poor animations), driving a car for 10 minutes through incredibly bland looking landscape, watching another conversation where you act like a cop from B movie (or maybe Z movie?) and your buddies act like actors from 4th grade school theatre, then going in alone (of course), navigating a dozen rooms shooting zombies and collecting pointless stuff, then facing a boss and dying multiple times in a row before you learn that QTE sequence (good dog!). After that, if you are lucky and the game didn't crash (happens with a fix as well sometimes) you watch another conversation and the day thankfully ends.  Incredibly bad and unfitting music adds the fun.  This is it. If there is a brilliant story, it is hidden too well under all this filler. I would think I don't like this game because I don't like Japanese games overall (they are too weird for me), but I enjoyed Murdered: Soul Suspect which is also a console Japanese game. This one is simply a poor game with no detective gameplay. Heck, there is hardly any gameplay at all.
3184	I've heard a lot about this game. This is probably the most overhyped game I've ever played. I've read tons of reviews on different sites and in Steam and almost everyone claims DP to be an uncut diamond, an underestimated masterpiece, a unique experience and so on. After playing it for almost 25 hours and coming up to the end I felt kinda... frustrated.  I must say that I really enjoyed its atmosphere and the first half of the story. I had no problems with graphics, poor animations, sound, controls etc. Everything was absolutely fine for me. I don't understand people who say it is a bad port, cuz it looks and is being played MUCH BETTER than on PS3. I don't understand the ones who play it with gamepad either cuz aiming with mouse is 100 times better. Everything was great for the first half of the game, but then...  First of all, the game pretends to be open world. With side-quests from different civilians. Bla-bla-bla. All these 'quests' are like 'find an old lady's picture in HER ROOM' (probably she became absolutely blind in her years, I don't know), 'find dead daughter's dress (in her room ofc)', 'find sheriff's dumbbell', 'find sheriff's assistant's keys' and so on. You got my point, right? Of course, there were some interesting quests like searching for dead man's bones and a map with secret passage BUT SUDDENLY...  ...the game stops to be openworld! For nearly ~4 or 5 last hours it becomes a straight 3rd person corridor shooter. And developers don't even warn us about this like 'guys, soon you will be unable to complete your quests and other stuff' and just push you through till the end. Seriously, â¥â¥â¥â¥ quests I didn't finish! â¥â¥â¥â¥ exploring! Surprise, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥!  Another thing, last, but not least.  ATTENTION! SPOILER ALERT! Don't read this if you still decided to buy and play this game!     Imagine that you are playing first Silent Hill, you enjoy every second of it and in the end of the game Alessa turns out to be a giant Godzilla with rocket launchers and a big pink ponytail. This is what I felt during the bossfights with George and Kaysen. I understand, that this is a Japanese game, it is supposed to be odd and weird, but Swery, seriously, is it some kind of trolling or were you just high? What the â¥â¥â¥â¥, man?    Thank you for reading this if u did. I am not going to persuade you not to buy this game, I am just sharing my own opinion. For me this game is one of the biggest disappointments ever compared to other games I've played. It started so good and ended like absolute delirium.
3185	An utterly broken piece of software. It'll run for a little bit then either fail to load the save file, stop recognizing keyboard input or simply crash. How bad does a game have to be before Steam decides to stop selling it?
3186	The game crashes without fail on startup. I have tried every solution that was recommended, it still won't get past the intro credits. It should be patched, but never will, because reasons. No, your advice didn't work. I'm sick of being put through the ringer, so even if it did work I don't care. Games should work for everyone, on every system, at launch.  Zero out of five Lennys ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( )
3187	Let me start off by saying I adore Deadly Premonition. After purchasing it on xbox360 at launch I was super excited to play the game again with this Director's Cut. The story is still great, the characters still quirky and awesome, the combat still forced and terrible.  However. After playing for an hour I ran into a bug that forced the game to crash again and again and again. Community fixes didn't work, I'm completely stuck, and from what I can tell on the forums I am not the only one. It's bad enough that the community had to fix the screen resolution because the game doesn't even give you options to adjust those yourself. But game breaking bugs that still haven't been fixed close to a year later? Ridiculous.   TLDR: Game is great on consoles one of my favorite of all time, get it there. Pc version is a buggy mess that probably won't work for you or at the very least gives you headaches trying to fix it so it's barely playable.  Update late 2016. After installing the game again on a new pc I finally got past the part it crashed at on my other system... only for it to crash righ after at the next cutscene. As much as I love the game...there is just no excuse for the way they have handled this release.
3188	This port is awful. The fps is the worst Fps I've ever seen in gaming. The settings are configured to the lowest they can possibly go (Thanks to a fan who made it possible to even configure the settings), yet I still get the same fps as if I changed nothing. Do not buy. It has been months since this game has released and they still have ignored it. If you really want to play this game, play it on xbox or ps3.
3189	I had this game in my library for about a day and a half when It first dropped on Steam. When I tried to play it, it was all stuttery and unresponsive, so I asked for my money back. I have no idea if that's still the case now, but I'd recommend checking out the pcgamingwiki page concerning this game before making the purchase.  On console, that's a different matter. The game is a gem, and it's weird as hell. Definitely check it out on a stable platform. I usually champion buying the 'good' version, but in this case, like with Dark Souls 1, this is definitely not the good version.
3190	Freezes at the end of a level. Driving is a nightmare.  Unplayable.
3191	Doesn't run. Crash on start every time.

3194	I really like Deadly Premonition but cannot recommend this bad PC port. It has a horrible framerate and crashes frequently. The game now freezes at a specific point which is 2 hours into the story (just after going through the hospital) and I cannot be bothered to find a way to progress as it will probably only crash at another specific point.  Luckily I bought it when it was only $2.
3195	'It can't be that bad!' I thought. 'I'll try it anyway!' I thought. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON PC! It is a nightmare of technical issues. Experiencing the game this way should be considered an absolute last resort. You can get it in Xbox 360 or PS3 without the crashing or hours of bugfixes that will render the PC version borderline playable.  Third party graphical enhancements SHOULD have made this the definitive edition of the game, but it is far too unstable to be worth any money at all.
3196	Still can't recommend the PC version of Deadly Premonition. Even WITH Durantes fix it still crashes pretty much on the hour every time. Did I mention this games uses save points as the save method too? So save points + consistent crashing = Good luck making any damn progress.  That aside the parts I've played were interesting, but controls are clunky and graphics are PS2-era at best.
3197	It's like Twin Peaks and Silent Hill had a baby with one of those immunodeficiency disorders where they need to be stuck in a plastic bubble. After downloading DPfix so I can run this game at a semi-decent framerate, setting it to windows 98 compatibility mode so it wouldn't crash about an hour in, and finding workarounds to keep the loading screens from freezing up, I got about halfway through. Now I'm in the middle of a quicktime event where none of my keys register, and nothing I can find will fix it.
3198	Unplayable,I spent more time researching fixes for the constant crashing.It may be a good game and it is one I have had on my 'to play' list for quiet some time now.I literally can't tell you waht combat is like as I crash prior to that.I have tried all fixes to no resolve.Finally I just gave up and uninstalled it.  Give it a miss or pick it up on console (never thought I would have ever heard myself say that).I really wish |Valve would clamp down on games like this as it's not my first time being left with a lemon due to what is possibly one of the worst pc ports (not forgetting Arkham Knight but at least that you can play for more than 15 minutes at a time)...  This game and many like it should be removed from the store, forcing the developers to realease a functioning product.I'm a huge fan of games like this and it pains me to review it in such a negative manner.  My specs are fine i7 3770k and a gtx 980 is overkill,so it's not my hardware holding me back..Fresh install of win 10 so its not that either.The game is just a terrible port,which is a real shame...   AVOID ON PC!!
3199	10/10 Game 0/10 Port The world's worst port of the world's best game- it's absolutely unplayable. Buy it for the 360 if you want to spend less than a year of bug-fixing for every 12 minutes of gameplay. I finished this through 100% after easily 200 crashes to desktop. I love this game with all my heart but managing to finish it with only 200 serious crashes and bluescreens is considered fortunate compared to most people trying to run this on PC.
3200	Port is terrible and doesn't work.
3201	The Best Game I can never recommend, because of bugs and crashes. Play the console version if you can!
3202	It's a good game, but it runs so terribly on computer, please do yourself a favor and just pick it up for console instead because it's really good, it's just unplayable on computer. 15fps, 720p, constant crashing and audio glitches, etc.
3203	Unbelievably the worst port I've ever came across in my life. Nevermind the fact you have to go through so much just to get the game not to crash on start, the crazy amounts of tinkering it takes to just make this thing work (or for me, not to work) is just worth it for this game. I'll never know if this game is recommendable considering the fact this port is just a huge piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥. The first 2 hours of the game is great!
3204	Great game. Terrible port. It hurts having to not recommend this game, because this is one of the best games I've ever played, but this port is unacceptable. It crashes randomly and it's riddled with game breaking bugs like AI NPCs not doing what they're supposed to making certain sections unbeatable (Nick's car not moving when you have to tail him and the final boss bugging out making it impossible to beat).  It's not worth it. Play it on PS3 or XBox. I paid next to nothing for this game and still wasted my money.  
3205	I'm a big fan of the Twin Peaks TV show/movie which was obviously a major influence in the development of Deadly Premonition. This is one reason I really want to recommend this game, but I can't. It's simply too buggy to play. The game crashes constantly. At ~14 hours gameplay, the game crashed (which happened frequently) but this time my save file was corrupted. So now I can start over from the beginning, or uninstall. Uninstall it is.  Maybe one day I will try it again &amp; keep a backup of my save file,  maybe ...
3206	The bottom line - not recommended.  The game mechanics is not intuitive, the combination of mouse\keyobard is not working well here.  The options menu - its hard to get arround in it, It took me over half a minute to figure out how to close it.  It seems the game has some performance issues, I ran the Witcher 3 and other more demanding titles on the same machine with ease, but here it seems clunky  About 30+ minutes into the game made me really disapointed, especially after seeing all the other good reviews,   
3207	THE DEADLY CRASH:  Can't play it at all, crashes on start up 'dp has stopped working'. Pity, it seemed promising.  I shift tab - CRASH Press escape - Crash Full screen mode- Crash Windowed - Crash. I don't have a bad computer and am unsure why this is happening but it seems to be unavoidable. Unfortunately I cannot recommend this game in such a poor state, that I can't even start it up. Sigh, $24... waste.
3208	I would have given this quirky game at least an 8/10, but due to hardware silliness, and a bad port...I just don't know.   I want to LOVE this game. I really do.   The console version is waaay better.   I'll base my review on what the game truly is without hardware/software difficulties and bad porting.   If you are familiar with Twin Peaks or any absurd David-Lynch works, you'll understand this game completely.   If you're not...just go with it. Yes. It's â¥â¥â¥â¥ing weird. Yes, York (the main character) is a dweeb. Yes, this town has no basis at all in reality. Just go with it.   Gameplay-wise...meh. It's really about the weird characters and story. Sidequests everywhere!  Ultimately, I cannot recommend the PC version if you're running any machine newer than like...2007-2009.  If you can get your hands on the xbox360 version. Great. 
3209	Controller and keyboard control customization is horrible. If I use the controller, then the camera keeps on spinning fast around the character...which causes me to feel dizzy and makes me want to lose my lunch. and I can't even adjust for that sort of thing to prevent that from happening. Keyboard controls also suck hardcore for a lefthanded person like me... you see, I like using my mouse with my left hand... which means I usually use arrow keys to nagvative, not that WASD â¥â¥â¥â¥. so there's usually a delayed reaction for my character when I have to switch between mouse and keys.... that ends up with my character dying a lot. it's actually much more work to play this game than it is fun to play..... I actually wish I hadn't brought this game in the first place.
3210	Port is terrible and doesn't work.
3211	Great game, not so great pc port. Play it on console if possible.
3212	The Best Game I can never recommend, because of bugs and crashes. Play the console version if you can!
3213	As some who has played through the 360 version of DP i can say its one hell of a game,but the pc port is a piece of diarrhetic dog â¥â¥â¥â¥.The game literary refuses to run on my rig regardless of what i did to try and make it work.So basically if you have a Ps3 or a 360 go get those versions,they may be ugly but at least they aren't a waste of your money.
3214	THE DEADLY CRASH:  Can't play it at all, crashes on start up 'dp has stopped working'. Pity, it seemed promising.

3217	Trying to open a door : game crash. Trying to drive my car : game crash. Trying to talk to people : game crash. Trying to launch the game : game crash. Trying to crash the game : game crash. Not doing anything at all : game crash.  10/10  Would crash again. And again. And again.
3218	This game is unplayable. I don't know what the actual game is like, maybe it's great, I'll never know, because the game crashes on launch. I can tolerate an awful PC port; that's what I did for Saints Row 2 and I loved that game (except for the port part, of course). What I can't tolerate is a PC 'port' that does not work at all. Shame on Rising Star for releasing a game that is literally unplayable.
3219	Ok I'm done. I'm done trying to get this to work. For as ambitious of a game as Deadly Premonition is, this port completely ruins whatever might have been a good game. I spent almost 30 hours of my life dealing with crashes, glitches, and other glaring issues and even removing all of that from the picture the game still has its problems which makes it completely unforgivable.  If you have any interest in playing this game whatsoever I would recommend you try and find a way to play it on the original platform(s) (360/PS3) as the port is just awful. Even after applying the fan-recommended patches the game has a dice roll for every area you load as to whether it will crash the game. Loading times can vary from 15 seconds to 2 minutes depending on factors you cannot control. Without the graphics patch the entire experience is blurry and ungratifying.  Even after patching the game and overlooking most of the porting issues. DP has fundamental problems with the aiming system which is very camera-dependent and glitchy at best. Vehicular controls are equally shoddy and the mapping system is more of a hinderance than it is a boon. The profiling sections serve more to cram ridiculously obvious information in your face than to reveal anything new and the chapter review quizzes are basically an insult to the viewer's intelligence ('HEY DO YOU REMEMBER THAT THING THAT HAPPENED 5 MINUTES AGO? HERE'S A QUIZ!!'). I really, _really_, tried to make this game work because it came off as highly recommended but the truth is it's just a mediocre silent hill clone with â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ RE4 controls and a lamentable open-world system.   I'm going to spend the rest of my 'time' on this game watching a longplay just to see how the story ends. I recommend you do the same.
3220	Be warned this game simply doesn't work. You can do a lot of effort and fixes to get the game to technically boot, or you can watch the first season of Twin Peaks. One is a significantly better use of your time than the other.
3221	This port is a pure garbage. And the ones responsible for it should be sentenced to 30 years of trying to make this game running. And if they would somehow succeeded, they would have to finish it with a crash after every loading!
3222	I want you to play this game, just not on the PC. Do you have a PS3? If so, turn it on and download this classic. It really is one of a kind at the moment with no other game to compare it to. Sadly the PC port is a right pain in the a$$! I had to fight with it for way too long, starting my game over because of saves that corrupted.   By the time I was done trying to get the game to work, I was afraid to mess with any of the add on content and played it in windowed mode in fear of it crashing. With that in mind, this game loves a good crash more than Nascar fans. If I could I would tell you it was worth it since the game is amazing when it is working, if you overlook the low budget that is.   Yet, you might not at the moment have any other choice but to play it on PC. If you choose to endure that path, get ready to fight for your right to play the game without problems. Now with the port aside, the game is far from perfect at times even seeming to be broken in places. The vibe it sets and the story it tells is just so cool that you learn to live with the many flaws and ugly graphics.   Also it does have one of the most annoying boss battles I can remember right at the end, but this game is still great and different. If you loved the TV show Twin Peaks, this is a must have and for any surreal fans, you would just be better off getting it on PS3 or finding a copy of the original on 360.
3223	        YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Deadly Premonition (REVIEW)&nbsp;
3224	The Game itself (Gameplay / Story): Wonderfull if you grew up with Twin Peaks.  The technical aspect of the game: Horrible.  ItÂ´s a great game if it runs on your system. (Luck dependend) ItÂ´s a horrible piece of work if it doesnÂ´t.  Chances are this game wonÂ´t run on your system no matter what you do.  This game maybe takes about 8 - 10 hours to playthrough.  Steam sais i needed 24,3h. ThatÂ´s because i had to play sections over and over again because the constant crashes und freezes. I even need to copy the save file between 3 PCÂ´s !!! with different OS and config.  With Win 8.1 donÂ´t even get started, there you will have all the problems that are available. With Win 7 you will have most of the problems.  Like i said, i finished this game on 3 PcÂ´s (Win 8.1, Win 7 64x, Win 7 32x)  
3225	It's so scary my PC can hardly play it with out saying NOPE and crashing to desktop.  In all seriousness there is a decent interesting game here but theres just too many bugs and crashes to make it worth while. From what I have played I really like it but having to play from save point to save point constantly worried if the next cut scene or character conversation is going to cause a crash really distracts from the story and atmosphere of the game.  A few fixes or patches would shape this up into a good little game but as is its I can't suggest anyone else buy this game.
3226	Can't recommend a game that doesn't work now, can I?   I have 6 hours played, with about half of that actually being played and saved. It crashed every 60 seconds, to 5 mins. I spent almost 4 hours trying to fix this game with all the resources available online to no avail.   I wish the devs, would have patched this before releasing it.
3227	This game does not work. As soon as it gets past the first cut scene and enters into play mode, the camera just spins and spins. I've put more time into trying to fix this one problem than I have playing the actual game. I can't even leave the first scene!  I want a game that works or I want my money back.
3228	This game is unplayable. I don't know what the actual game is like, maybe it's great, I'll never know, because the game crashes on launch. I can tolerate an awful PC port; that's what I did for Saints Row 2 and I loved that game (except for the port part, of course). What I can't tolerate is a PC 'port' that does not work at all.

3230	I can't believe I've put up with this torture for more than 30 hours. Probably the half of it was spent for just getting the game run properly. I've seen all kinds of glitches, e.g. crashing, freezing, broken image, stuck in a corner, etc., etc. I tried DPFix and various kinds of attempts, none of which worked definitively. I am not complaining about the story and contents by themselves, but this is arguably one of the worst implementations of a console game. It's amazing how many bugs the devs could cram into this and still managed to think the game is playable.  No, I won't play this again. (I was supposedly in the last chapter.)  P.S. Also, the game behavior is affected by random things like monitor resolution, which makes running this game a kind of black magic. I regret I've run out of extra sheeps to sacrifice.
3231	I dont no where even to begin this mass.The game apsolutly broken in all ways posible,i have no ide how it is positive on steam. The performance is is just horoble ,the audio in just not in the same place ,you can have like set it to 80% all it will randomly go stronger then weaker ,one cutscene your will bleed through your ears ,in another you cant hear anithing ,and trust me it is not on my side . Ohohohhoo VIDEO....absolutely no settings what so ever ,NOTHING ,no resolution nothing nothing .....  Thank God the is like a *fan made* patch you can copy this files to game and fix this ,you can manually add resolution nad AA and SSA etc ...  Bad optimized game ,even if it is 1,01 version  And the WORST part EVER in this game is just horoble horoble horoble aiming ,OMG ,absolutely broken,and there are many types of enemies ,there are like fast ones ,that can blink like in a sec they are in front of you ,good luck aiming that ,and i hear boss fight are inposible ,will see about that later I just dont like what so ever to quit games,i dont remember last time i did not finish the game,but i think this one will be the first in many years :/  Voise acting in cutscene and worst then amateur ,ahahah lips are not evem moving like WTF  just a fanny broken game ,I like survival horror games like SH and RE ,but this is 0 ,they are going that way ,but failed horoble in everithing.
3232	Zach i should of known.. this PC port the coffee warned me about it.
3233	Terrible combat system. Saving only at specific locations. Not fun at all when you have to repeat 5 or more minutes of your gameplay. I thought it will be more about story and puzzles. It's about shooting zombies in the head.
3234	It doesn't work. It crashes on startup every time with error 'dp.exe has stopped working'
3235	Good game, terrible PC port almost unplayable
3236	Weird Game ! very engaging but a crappy port !
3237	Very definition of nightmare-ish voice acting.
3238	This is an amazing game that is completely hobbled by one of the worst PC ports that I have ever seen. I've tried it on two different, fairly beefily specced systems and both of them get roughly five frames per second. Going by the forums, the developer has apparently abandoned the project entirely, so unless the community gets together and fixes the myriad of bugs still left in this terrible tragedy of a release, it will never be worth purchasing.  Stay away my friends!
3239	This port is absolutely miserable, and frankly I could have lived without ever getting to experience Deadly Premonition if it also meant never having to experience a port this bad.  I don't think whatever good there is to the game, and there's a lot to recommend, is worth tearing your hair out getting it to work. Even after getting it to run at its best, I experienced myriad problems. One in particular is that, without wishing to spoil, there are moments when the game will pull a sort of picture-in-picture thing where you're seeing the main game camera, and a second camera from another character, and for whatever reason my computer found this the most difficult to manage, and I have a pretty decent rig. I do not have any explanation for why this is so. Garry's Mod has no issues with a similar set-up. Split-screen multiplayer games in general on my PC manage this with no problems. Why, then, does this game have an issue with it? It's a pretty important effect as far as the gameplay goes, why would they code it so poorly?  Rising Star ought to be ashamed of themselves for allowing this to make it to retail, and they should be even more ashamed that they have still yet to make any effort to fix it. Absolutely shameful.
3240	Deadly Premonition is an amazing game. The dialogue is hilarious, the cutscenes are cheesy and fun, and the plot's similarity to Twin Peaks (which the creators loved) is a huge plus.   So why the thumbs down? Because this is a terrible, terrible port. The first issue I noticed was the camera shaking and vibrating during a lot of the scenes. Okay, not a huge deal, so I kept going. Then I started experiencing frequent crashes, some at key points that required me to run through the same (unskippable) scene four times before I found a proper workaround. The last straw was listening to the audio scratch and pop before leaving the hotel just to run into a loading screen that went on for over a minute before I gave up on it.  Again, Deadly Premonition is an excellent game. I can't recommend it enough for the PS3 or the Xbox. But this port? Save your money.
3241	The game is very enjoyable and it's design is unique. It has flaws, but those flaws bring a type of charm to the game that is very addicting. But the port is so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing bad that it's unplayable. The fps â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ in it's pants in some areas. The controls are bad and have technical difficulties. But the nail in the coffin is the random and sometimes guaranteed crashing. The problem is that working around these crashes are boring and can take a long time. Since there are so many issues with the port it's never clear what causes your game to crash, so you spend a lot of time trying to find the solution on the internet, but I just got tired of it. It's a great game, but I don't think any game is worth this much. You're buying a pig in a poke with this, and I can't recommend that to anyone.
3242	This game is broken.
3243	Unplayable
3244	Horribly ported.  Go buy it for the 360.  I spent a good bit of my playtime just struggling to make it run. The game is good but this port is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing cancer.
3245	An unplayable port of a great game. Unplayable within the first 5 seconds of starting due to ridiculous framerates. Did not even get as far as the crashes. Community patches do nothing. I really wish I could play this game because I know for a fact that it's really good. I paid a dollar and I still feel cheated. Do yourself a favor and avoid this version like the plague. If you pay full price for this I can only pity you.
3246	I tried to play the game Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut yesterday. This game originally came out on the Xbox 360 in 2010. It was recently re-released on PS3 as well as ported to the PC. For years this game has been heralded as an open-world survival horror homage to Twin Peaks: the story involves a quirky FBI agent investigating a strange murder in Washington state. The original version of the game also involved the detective interacting with two dwarves in a red room; maybe homage is an understatement.  Make no mistake the game is terrible. It controls like Resident Evil 4 and has graphics which are about the same - except it was released 5 years later. It was developed by a small Japanese game studio that had a deep appreciation for David Lynch so naturally it has developed a cult following in the states.  Some of my favorite games were developed by Japanese game companies. My wife and I both love the Tales games released by Namco Tales as well as the SMT/Persona games released by Atlus. The key difference here as that both of these companies do great localization - that is, they spend a lot of time getting decent translation of the original Japanese dialogue.  This is pretty important; if you don't do that then a lot of the humor and personal interaction just comes across as stilted and awkward. I have the feeling that this is pretty much the case with Deadly Premonition. I think a lot of folks view the 'quirky dialogue' as Lynchian - but considering how poorly the rest of the game comes together it is more likely that this is just bad localization.
3247	I wanted to say something good about this game but I can't. This game is very bad console port, so bad that without proper fixes it is highly possible that the game won't even start and even if it actually 'works' there are high chances that it will crash very often. If you will be able to play without crashes there are few more disappointments awaiting; first of all a very dull, badly desingned, clunky, repetitive and boring gameplay straight away from early psx titles. There is basiclly one type of zombie-like enemy and thats it(well there are also 2 dull boss fights and one enemy that crawls on walls but its not worth mentioning). For some reason developers thought that a lot of QTE is good idea(Tip; it's not), so there is also a lot of that. This is my first game in which I liked that there was more cutscenes than actual gameplay. Next thing; graphics. I'm not a graphics fanatic. If game is good it might look like a s**t. This is not the case here. Graphics in this game looks absolutely terrible. Looks like something from early 2002 but it was actually released in 2010! I'm wondering if developers of this game were in hibernation last decade. I'm also wondering how original game looked like if this is 'improved' version.  Ok. Fine. I can deal with terrible graphic. I really do! But there is next thing; very looooong loading times! I dunno how they manged to do this but on my i5 4670k @ 4,4ghz, gtx770, 8gb ram, with ssd drive game can be loading for 1-2minutes! Any other game I have played haven't been loadind as long as this game. Even the newest and most hardware-intensive games can load ten times faster that this... Audio. Usually I don't bother with audio in games but again this game is diffrent. There are like 3 or 4 songs that play in diffrent moments during cutscenes etc. And that wouldn't be bad except often some funny and cheerfull songs are playing while there is some sirious stuff going on, completly broking immersion(if ther is any...). There is also sound-loop bug while driving a car btw. Yes you can drive a car(driving is horrible)! My only motivation for beating this game was story. It was good at first, but later it became average at best. This game is just bad at everything. Good thing I bought it for 2,5â¬ when it was on sale!
3248	There's broken games, like Bioshock and dark souls 1, all fixable with tweaking and fixes  Then there's Deadly Premonition, a cancerous mass that even mods and tweaks can't save. They can only spruce it up, but now we just have a spruced up corpse on our hands. A zany, goofy, unique spruced up corpse on our hands.
3249	This game is broken.
3250	I love this game to death... But it simply doesn't work on PC. It is so bad. Literally the worst port I've ever played, to the point where the game is unfinishable.
3251	This game literally refuses to work. I have tried every concievable solution to play this game, but it's useless. It won't work.  Shame on you Steam. Make sure the products you're selling actually â¥â¥â¥â¥ing work.
3252	This pains me to write. The game itself seems fantastic, but it's probably one of the worst PC ports I have ever had the misfortune to play. Do not buy this, go and play the SUPERIOR console version over this failed abortion of a port.

3259	I am here for Mr. Stewart's lunch, if it is ready I'd thank you a bunch.
3260	Good game IF you can get it to work which i cant
3261	Don't buy this broken â¥â¥â¥â¥, low frame rate, crashes, looks like â¥â¥â¥â¥...
3262	This pains me to write. The game itself seems fantastic, but it's probably one of the worst PC ports I have ever had the misfortune to play. Do not buy this, go and play the SUPERIOR console version over this failed abortion of a port.
3263	This game runs poorly, even if you install DPFix. It doesn't look very good. It controls poorly. The combat, hiding, and evasion scenes are even poorly designed, before you get to controlling them. I've had it crash several times. I've only played a short bit on PC to see how it would run, after completiting it on Xbox 360, and I've had force-quits multiple times. I've even heard of bugs that can prevent you from completing the game, which is the entire reason to play the game.   But this game is enchanting. The story and characters, as much as you can say they are stolen from Twin Peaks, are fascinating and engaging. You will likely have numerous fits of laughter as you experience the quirky animations and dialogue. And the plot goes into perhaps even stranger and disturbing depths than Twin Peaks did. It's worth your time to stick with the game, even if the game is not to your liking, because the story is not to be missed.  That said, if a game that has numerous technical issues is going to bother you, then you shouldn't play it. You can experience the story elsewhere, and get most of the enjoyment from watching it as you would playing it, without having to struggle through what most people would consider a negative experience of completing the game's often tedious 'dungeon' segments.   I would say to absolutely wait for sales, even if you really want the game, and know you will enjoy it. This game goes on sale for as much as 90% off fairly regularly, such that I've purchased extra copies for others on several different occasions in the last few years, so you won't have to wait long to get a deal. I first purchased it for $15, as the original release on the Xbox 360, and didn't regret it one bit, but not everyone will get that same enjoyment, or have the same feelings. I can't recommend it at normal price, but cannot recommend it enough for $2.50-$5.
3264	The game was 720p fixed. You must download the dpfix ( you can change the resolution manually in ini file). i played the prolouge and the hotel mission then i closed the game. a little bit later i would play the game,.......... WTF there are no savefiles to load. :( 
3265	This product should not be sold on Steam. Granted, there are some people who successfully installed and ran and even played it, BUT there are many many others, myself included, who have tried and failed multiple times to play it.  Generally, I usually chuckle at people who have problems installing a game but this time the joke is on me. I tried three different PCs, nothing funky in the hardware and OS of any of them (all Win 7 64bit). Long story short, I did manage to run the game. My gameplay (after actually entering the game) consisted of one interaction before the game crashed. Repeated attempts came to the same conclusion: it seemed that any interaction caused the game to crash.  There are a number of so-called fixes, none of which worked. An amusing one requires you to run the PhysX driver over again, first to uninstall and then to reinstall. This actually works, sorta. It allowed me to get behind an instant crash and get the game running. But as noted above, the game would crash soon thereafter.   If you get DP as part of a cheap bundle, go for it and roll the dice, but don't pay even a Steam holiday sale price for this product.
3266	All I can say is: Stay away from this game. It's the single most broken, poorly constructed amateurish piece of technological garbage I have ever witnessed in my entire life.  If you're fortunate enough to get past the confusing launcher(that has absolutely no technical options whatsoever, restricting you to a control configuration screen that thinks 1 and 2 are 'RT' and 'LT'), you get to enjoy the seemingly 9 in 10 chance of encountering a crash before you even see the main character on screen.  Should you, against all odds, actually get to a fairly playable place in the game, you'll find that something as simple as drawing your weapon... Drops your FPS to about 15-20. If you can deal with that, good. But the game doesn't stop there.  I was unable to get past the first time the 'Profiling' prompt appeared. Why? Because the game encountered a runtime error. Really.   And while I realise many will say 'Oh, but Durante's fix will fix all this!', that's a blatant lie. DPFix is snake oil and causes more issues than it fixes. Running DPFix, I was getting several graphical glitches as well as several crashes.  I'll continue trying to get this functional, but this does not bode well.
3267	A fantastic story for an unplayable game.  If your mental is strong enough to endure 10 crashes/mn, you can try to 'play' this game.  With better graphism and professional programmation, this game could be a must have but they may forgot to pay programmers so....  :(
3268	Crash to desktop all the time. Can't even play the game. Useless port.
3269	Waste of Money.
3270	It took me 30 minutes to get it started and, when I did, it crashed.  10/10
3271	It's Twin Peaks, but terrible.
3272	I am sorry but i foound this game losing of money. I did not like nothing in hame. i am sorry to developers and people who thinks oposite... maybe its just not my style.
3273	Despite it's interesting Twin Peaks like premise and great atmosphere the bugs this game is plagued with (like random crashes back to the desktop causing you to lose progress) I cannot recommend this game to anyone.
3274	Was really hoping to love this one, as I'm totally into weird kusoge heavily inspired by Twin Peaks, but I was so taken aback by the blatant misogyny all over the place that I haven't touched this ever since I finally picked it up. Just seems like the weirdest thing that nobody ever mentioned this to me and I had to spend money to find out for myself. So in case you're wondering, yourself, there it is. Now gamers can vote my review down because I didn't evaluate it completely or objectively or whatever (die, nerds).
3275	STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THIS!  Here's a few of my favorite bugs and glitches:   1. Once you reach the hotel and walk into the cafeteria hallway, the sound will give out this blast of distortion that makes your speakers cry out for a quick death. THIS HAPPENED FOUR TIMES.   2. During the in game cut scenes, York will light a cigarrette, but somebody â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up the animation so that when he removes the cig from his mouth, one will be in his hand and another will stay in his mouth.   3. The inventory menu is like a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ minefield for crashes. The game crashed on me at least 3 different times when I checked my inventory for either a medikit, some food or just to see the map. The inventory screen will both haunt and mock you.   4. During the second part of chapter one, while you're in the hospital and you're about to wrap it up after killing 3 zombies who are armed with shotguns, you just need to walk out of the hospital and then a cutscene will start up and you've finished the section. What's the problem with this ? WHENEVER THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING CUT SCENE STARTS UP, THE GAME CRASHES. Don't give me this 'windows 98 compatibility mode fixed it for me' â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. It worked for me sure, except it took 30 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing minutes to clear a 2 minute piece of game due to the frame rate drop!   5. Starting the game up in Windows 98 compatibility mode will prevent you from using a gamepad. Wanna use that nice comfy 360 controller you bought for games like this? Well don't worry, you can use the A, B , X and Y buttons. Oh, you want to use the thumbsticks? â¥â¥â¥â¥ you.   And those are only off the top of my head! I'm sure if I sat down and really thought about it, I could easily come up with 10 more!   I was really enjoying this game at first, but the bugs make it unplayable. I managed to make my way through almost through the first chapter but then the game would constantly freeze on me whenever I attempted to make my way through to my objective (the manor where the townspeople are to be questioned).   Many people claim running the game in Windows ME/98 will fix this. That much is true only half of the time. This theory works when it wants to, at other times however the frame rate will drop all the way down to 10 FPS (what's the point then?) . I searched high and low for an answer to the drop in frame rate and it seems I'm not the only one suffering from this. No answer could be found.   Seriously, this game is incredibly unique, cool and different. I wanted to play through this so much, but in its current state, it's just unplayable. It'd be nice to get a refund, but considering that the developers don't care about their customers, and trying to convince Steam to test the products they put up for sale is about as likely as the next coming of Jesus, I find this unlikely.   Again, STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THIS PORT. If you've got a PS3 or 360 just buy that version, I certainly know I will.
3276	This game seems so promising. I mean, it's based on Twin Peaks, and amazing TV show, that still to this day is relevant, and enjoyable. Unfortunately, there are so many bugs, crashes, and errors that this game is hard to recommend. Hard, because I WANT to recommend it, but when a game is as faulty as this one, I simply cannot endorse it.  These Japanese developers cannot hide behind the quality of their games anymore, when offered on consoles. They need to put forth the effort to make them playable on PCs as well, something they seem reluctant to do. It's unfortunate, because I love a lot of the games Japan offers, but I cannot in good conscience stand behind something that is so obviously flawed in the PC market.  Even the much maligned Konami(boy is that a change given how much they were loved through the 80s and 90s) offers ports that are better performing than much of the Japanese games in the PC games market. It's really unfortunate, since I don't think PCs are beyond Japan's understanding. They seem to be people with a great understanding of electronics, yet play by the rules of consoles, and not the openended way of PCs. I hate to break it to Japan, but choice is a way of life, and rigidity enforced by consoles is simply a way of the past. The PS4 and XBone are proving that. They came out recently, and yet are far behind the PC market. People who want more power, and are willing to put in the work to access that, will always be far ahead of the console market. Many developers recognize that, and make games catering to the PC market. Even guys like Totalbiscuit will recognise that in the beginning of his reviews, highlighting what the options portion of the game allow a player to customize. The old ways of the console have become antiquated. The personal computer, while being around since the 80s, if not farther back than that, offers more choice and customization, and the offerings of hardware allow multiple different price points of entry. That is the way of the future, rather than a one size fits all console offering.  Most of the world has accepted this. Japan would do well to join the trend. Now I realize I am singling out this developer, who may have felt backed into a corner, with consoles the best chance of success. However, I realize that in today's times, 2015, consoles are NOT your best choice, regardless of the market. You adapt, or fall behind.
3277	Recipe:  3 Parts mediocre Twin Peaks rip off (that's high praise for a Twin Peaks rip off, most don't even qualify as mediocre) 1 Part Silent Hill A pinch of Resident Evil 4 (NO, NO, YOU GRABBED CHRIS' SECTION FROM RE6 YOU FOOL!!!!!!!) Enough bugs and glitches to make the game almost need to be called Deadly Premonition Unity And just a touch of Red Dead Redemption near the end  Honestly, I enjoyed 90% of this game, but no game made in 2013 should need to be run in Windows 98 Compatibility Mode if you want to beat the final boss (who, by the way, is so completely out of place from the rest of this game that it's half the reason I'm not recommending it). I had to spend most of the time in XP Compatibility, but that still crashed occasionally and prevents you from aiming up and down properly which is needed rarely, but when it's needed it's needed. When it was crashing or aiming was required I switched to 98 which had enough load times that my hair turned grey. Occassional... dungeons?... are full of QTE which is thankfully only in those specific chase sequemces. The driving of any car faster than the free cop car involves spinning 360 degrees if you hit a pebble as 90% of vehicles handle like turbo charged bath tubs.  On the other handle, I liked the story and characters. Once I finished with the atrocious final boss I went back and finished all the side quests to learn more about the citizens of Greenvale (hence my 56+ hours of play). Of course, a bug involving quest items and replaying missions caused me to have to restart the entire game to get the second last achievement and the last one won't unlock despite patch notes saying the issue was fixed. If you've got the patience and the weird mind this game aims for, by all means play it. I just can't recommend it with a clear conscience without warning you first.
3278	Despite it's interesting Twin Peaks like premise and great atmosphere the bugs this game is plagued with (like random crashes back to the desktop causing you to lose progress) I cannot recommend this game to anyone.
3279	It was funny game but optimization was pretty bad and eventually made it unbearable
3280	I am sorry but i foound this game losing of money. I did not like nothing in hame. i am sorry to developers and people who thinks oposite... maybe its just not my style.
3281	Broken Twin Peaks rip off.
3282	This is one of the worst game I have ever played. Once you're actually able to run it(you'll probably have to google a fix like I did) be prepared... bad gfx, bad voice acting, bad story, bad controls, bad gameplay. Don't buy it, even if it's on special.
3283	I really wish there was a shrug icon when reviewing games. On the one hand, I am enjoying this, on the other, there are way too many cutscenes! It almost seems like take three steps forward, watch a cutscene, etc. The controls feel very awkward at the start. Unlike a lot of other players, I'm not having problems with CTD or FPS drops, so I can't complain about that.
3284	I would not reccomend this game to anyone, the story seems intruiging, gameplay is passable, graphics are passable, but it just SO incredibly badly made, its just a pure miracle if you get the damn thing to work, and even if you do, its beyond impossible to expect it to work well for any decent length of time.  I dont care how good, how unique, how interesting a game may be, when its such an incredible hassle to get the thing working, and then, to have it stay working long enough for you to actually play it, its just not worth the price or the time, i wouldnt accept this â¥â¥â¥â¥ from an early access game, let alone a full price retail release (i bought it in a sale, and still think its a waste), it just shows incredibly sloppy work, and arrogance on the devs part, to expect people to pay for a game which they couldnt even make playable unless you fix it yourself (or durante fixes it for you).  Long story short, your better off not wasting your money or time on a game that takes blind luck for it to even work for you with or without the community fixes.
3285	I was excited to dive straight into what I've heard is a cult-classic with a strange, but entertaining storyline and fantastic characters. But unfortunately for me, I could not get the game to run without incredible lag, like many others have experienced. After tinkering around for a fix, it now just crashes at startup. Your chances of getting this game to work for you on PC seem to be 50/50. You'll have to decide whether it's worth the gamble.  I am hoping the devs eventually get back to this with some bug fixes, but it's not looking good. As it stands, I can't recommend what looks like an otherwise great game.
3286	Cons: Obviously an awful port of a console game to PC. Terrible keyboard control. Sections of menu are unnavigable (options constantly scroll as if DOWN key is depressed). Terrible graphics/visuals. Trope: Game opens with murdered, naked woman. Trope: Creepy twin children. Trope: Awful voice acting and awful dialogue.  Pros: * Something vaguely like Twin Peaks in the theme (at least of the first 10 minutes). That's a far as I could stomach the cons above before quitting and uninstalling. * Game only cost $0.05 in my humble bundle purchase (all other funds went to other games in bundle).
3287	The game kept crashing. Its such a bummer because from the parts I played, the game did show alot of promise. I can not recommend a game that crashes so frequently however.
3288	Terrible port. Won't run in fullscreen mode if I select fullscreen mode and crashes otherwise. Unplayable. Do NOT buy this.
3289	This is probably my favourite game ever.  This is also the worst port I have ever played.   For a few hours, I thought I was safe from the horrors of the port. I followed recommended fixes, ran it in compatability mode and the like, but it randomly - in full screen mode - being windowed with the rest of the screen black. Then it started crashing, randomly - in the middle of a cutscene, in the middle of a level, in the map screen.   I paid 2.49 for this and it isn't worth it.   It really is unplayable.   Treat yourself and get the XBOX360 version - that I have played through, and yeah, the controls are clunky, but they're clunky no matter what version you play. The XBOX360 version works. I'm planning (when PS3's come down in price) to get the director's cut for the PS3.  Anyway, in terms of the game, this is one of my favourite things ever. Having ran through the game the first playthrough, I'm doing all of the sidequests this time. It is a wonderful, quirky, interesting, strange game. Get it on console and enjoy.
3290	I really tried to like this, but simply couldn't.  Not long after I finished binge watching Twin Peaks, I felt like the need to revisit the experience and Deadly Premonition seemed like it would be just that. A weird detective game set in a mysterious mountain town filled with quirky characters. Heck, even the female lead looked like Naomi Watts (Mulholland Dr?).   There were countless reviews stating how terrible the game was, but no amount of bad reviews could've stopped me from buying this game. Man, oh, man were they right. The game's simply unplayable. And not simply because it's a bad port. It's a small game overextended to a massive open world with terrible writing and the worst soundtrack of all time. I played it for less than 2 hours and had heard the whistling theme song at least 10 times, so I tried playing it with the sound muted. Didn't help.  I really tried to like this game, but it's not just so weird it's good. It's so weird it's bad and not in a Twin Peaks way.  If you're looking for a twin peaks-esque game, try Fahrenheit (also abysmally terrible writing, but atleast I managed to finish it).  Sadly, not recommended. Not until I get myself to finish the game.
3291	Game would not start. I would press play and it would crash. I have windows 7 and a high end computer.  Below is what I found that worked. Anytime I have to go through this much to get it to work it will get a thumbs down. congrats Dp you get my first thumbs down on steam.   -Go to where Deadly Premonition is installed, easily accessible by right-clicking the game in your Steam library &gt; Properties &gt; Local Files &gt; Browse Local Files -Open the folder named 'redist' -Scroll until you find the file 'PhyX_SystemSoftware.msi -Double click -Run the 'Repair' option -Now run Deadly Premonition via Steam as usual 
3292	It won't start, don't buy.
3293	You can't really fully enjoy the game when the crashes keep you from progressing. Yes, there are a lot of them.
3294	DONT BUY THIS GAME...IT DOESNT WORK FOR MOST ANYBODY...STEAM IS A BUNCH OF â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥UCKERS FOR STILL SELLING IT...
3295	Played this game for HALF AN HOUR and this is what I learned: - Terrible sound design and ridiculous voice acting - Horrible graphics - Poor performance and NO WAY TO CHANGE GRAPICHS SETTINGS - Boring gameplay (Feels like a Resident Evil knock off)  Don't buy - not even on sale! Get Resident Evil or Silent Hill instead!
3296	This isn't a game. This isn't even a beta-test. This is a crashy mess I got gyped into purchasing.  Really â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sick of fixing developers issues. Unless you feel like fixing some script DO NOT PURCHASE.
3297	The game's not bad. I got it free on PS3. Can't run it on Win 8.1 though. So no recommendation from me.
3298	Great game but this port is absolutely â¥â¥â¥â¥, better off getting it on console.
3299	The game itself is amazing, but the Controller support is broken and makes this version too frustrating to play.
3300	This thing barely works.  And even if you manage to get it not crash at the start up, have fun watching it crash throughout the game too.  
3301	It's ugly, it's got not no graphics options (stuck at 720p, though there are fanmade fixes), it plays terribly, features average voice acting and is a poor Twin Peaks knockoff. Grab on sale if you're morbidly curious.  3/10
3302	As a game, I'd say it's good because of its story but as a product it is not. You will spend a lot of time to try to fix the problems that should've been ironed out before release and I don't think it's worth the time when nothing works as it should.
3303	I'm sure the original version of the game was a perfectly playable game, but I just have to express how terrible this PC port is. No resolution or graphic options unless you download a patch and adjust them manually. Without the patch the game is basically unplayable, and even with it it still has a myriad of issues. The patch makes the game look much better and run faster as well, but after playing it for a bit you will see that there is some sort of memory leak which, after about 10 minutes of gameplay, ends up degrading the performance back to what it was without the patch. This caused me to try and speed from savepoint to savepoint so that I could restart the game to get it back to running efficiently. If that wasn't annoying enough, it takes about 5 minutes to load from cutscene to cutscene, or from a cutscene back to being able to play. I thought the game had frozen, so I just left it while I did something else and came back to find that it was finally playing the cutscene. This made it more tedious to quit and restart the game because the process took about 5 minutes to quit and then get back to the state where you could play it again. Along with all of that, I fell through the floor multiple times when walking through doors, sometimes the quicktime events would not work which was very frustrating especially when you need to do them to avoid dying. I think the story is very intriguing. The dialoge has a bit of broken english, but I think it gives the game a little charm. I would like to finish the story, but dealing with the flaws in the game makes it far too time consuming for me to stand. I'd recommend just watching someone else play it, or maybe getting the original version if you can.
3304	Avoid this PC port, but play this game (on Xbox 360 or PS3)! It's a terrific, dramatic story, in a memorable, immersive, offbeat/surreal virtual town, PC porting issues aside.  If you do get the PC *port*, expect to put up with crashes every hour or so, long load times between zones and cutscenes (especially cutscenes), if you can even figure out the tricks to get it to run. Then, even when you're able to play, you still have to put up with broken vertical aiming that only shows up in the PC version.  If you still get the PC port, look at DPfix (and fiddle w/ resolution and windowing settings), and try setting compatibility to WinXP SP2, or better yet Win98 (but with Win98 you'll probably have to give up the built-in gamepad support and either use keyboard/mouse (mapped onto console/gamepad-first controls) or messing around w/ a third-party gamepad mapper).  I was on the fence 'yes' or 'no', but I'll leave it at 'no' both to stand out in the reviews, and to stick w/ my opinion that this particular PC version should be avoided unless you really don't have a 360 or PS3. I would hate to have you sour on this game's story and world simply b/c the PC port sucks major suck (seriously, even if you could get around the keyboard/mouse, load times (with only a blank screen, no indication DP hasn't frozen--tip: unless it CTDs, it'll probably load, just give it a few more MINUTES) can be unbearable).
3305	Let me start by saying that I like this game, but I cant say enough how much you shouldnt buy it here. This port is broken. You are lucky if it works at all on your computer. For me, with my brand new gaming computer, this game crashes every seven muinets at the most, Making this game unplayable, as many of the save points can be as far as fifteen muinets apart.  Buy the 360 or PS3 version. Theyre still bugy, but at least they work.
3306	Never able to play. Many problems for most users. Check forums before you decide to spend your money.
3307	Good game, completely worthless port.
3308	 2/10   At first I struggled with the game crashing. After fixing that I realized that crashing is actually better than playing this game.
3309	I wanted to like this game, and it has its moments. It is buggy, often crashing to desktop or bluescreening. The gameplay itself is mostly a string of tiresome exercises that lead from one plot point to another. And for a while that was enough. It is kind of fun to see York unravel the mysteries of this town. But after a while, I don't know if its charm just faded, or some of the twists just broke suspension of disbelief or what. By the end, I was just going through on stubbornness.  On the bright side, it made me all nostalgic for Twin Peaks, and I picked up the boxed set. 
3310	This game is a lot of fun! One day, I will buy it on a console and complete it. There is currently no chance that I will play this all the way through on the PC. All it does is crash. There are numerous help documents to help in making this game more playable for the PC, but I don't think they ever stop. I think we become immune to them at some point, but I have given up reloading this game again, it takes at least a minute to do that on its own. You just have to look at the guide section of this game on Steam to realise that there are some serious issues with this game.  My thought is that a game can become immortalised by being released on PC. Thus being playable for years to come. In the case of Deadly Premonition, it is going to need a serious makeover.  Maybe it will or does work for you, but you are most likely one in a few who have had success with the PC version of this game.
3311	I have this for the XBox 360, so was excited to see it come to the PC. Wow was I wrong...! This is a horrible port, to the point the game is unplayable. Now I have a nice and powerful rig, with 8gb Ram, an Gigabyte HD 7970 and still get horrible stuttering at around 4 fps. So I go to change the resolution which is only at 720 when I realise I cant! The res is set at 720!   WHo ok'd a port like this? It's ridiculous that this game went on sale in a state like this. The original game had it's issues but was a diamond in the rough. The PC port is nothing but a lump of coal. If I thought I'd have a snowballs chance in hell, I'd ask Steam for a refund. Yes, it's refund bad.
3312	Great game bad port. so as things are at the moment ( where i can't even play the port ) i wouldn't recommend anyone to have a try with it. But hopefully it will get the fixes it needs. and when it does, this game is clearly worth the price.
3313	Do not buy this game on PC. Get it on PS3 if you can, or Xbox 360 if you have no other options if you really want to play it.  First and foremost, crashes when trying to run at full screen. Horrible lag when running in windowed mode. Durante's working on a fix, but at least Dark Souls was playable.  Do not get.
3314	I had heard a lot of things about this game being a cult classic so I wanted to check it out. Luckily I got it on sale. The game itself is fun enough....when it works. This is a pretty poor port. In the 2 hours or so I put into it, I encountered serious framerate issues and game crashes. While I'd love to finish the game, having to sit through the unskippable intro logos isn't worth it when I'm seeing them so often due to the game crashing. Looks like I'll be watching a Let's Play of this instead of playing it.
3315	This game is currently broken, crashing to a black screen. Although quirky and original, in it's current state it is a broken product and should not have been released. It is currently impossible to recommend until it is functioning properly.
3316	I love the game, but the PC version is terriable. I always keep on getting a steam fatal error saying that steam must be running to play the game. Get it for the PS3 instead.
3317	Great game but this port is absolutely â¥â¥â¥â¥, better off getting it on console.
3318	The game itself is amazing, but the Controller support is broken and makes this version too frustrating to play.
3319	Even with V1.01b patch game constantly crashes. Cause of that can't complete Chapter 2 Part 1.
3320	This thing barely works.  And even if you manage to get it not crash at the start up, have fun watching it crash throughout the game too.  
3321	The cheezy and dialogue, dated graphics, terrible voice acting and stale and uninteresting gameplay is over-comeable, as it does mold together to make something weirdly entertaining. However, the game is filled with so many bugs and glitches that it's hard to play more than an hour without stumbling on some glitch that requires you to restart the game to be fixed.
3322	As a game, I'd say it's good because of its story but as a product it is not. You will spend a lot of time to try to fix the problems that should've been ironed out before release and I don't think it's worth the time when nothing works as it should.
3323	Honestly this game is Terrible, it's a stark reminder of the bad side PS2 era, it looks like a bad PS2 game it playes like a bad PS2 game. Just a reminder this is a 2010 release and LOOKS LIKE IT CAME FROM 2003. The facial animation for each character is just so horribly done its a joke. The developer thought it would be fun to lock the resolution so its stuck in 720p, had to go and install a 3rd party fix just to get it to run properly in the correct resolution. Then when it does get going it crashes every 15 mins, or freezes on the pause menu requiring you to restart your progress from the last save point which are few and far in between out in the town. Lets talk a moment abou the HORRIBLE town design, I finished a story mission to be told that I have more then 12 hours til the next mission, so does the game give you some directions on where to go to sleep/pass time? NO, it gives you a marker to that mission and keeps telling you to come back, so in order to get to the mission I have to drive half way across town to the only sleeping bag not behind locked doors over half my cars gas. Oh did I forget to mention that? Cars have gas, so if you didnt do what I did after about an hour of searching for the sleeping bag and look it up online, you'll run out of gas and be screwed. The Enemies are a complete joke they are ALL 'ghosts' that do nothing but bend over backwards like a haunted yoga instructer, never actually doing much besides walking slower than the earth turns towards you. They do get weapons but then all the do is just hold them up to thier faces and again never actually do anything. All in all dont waste your time, the game is terrible, the plot works mostly but the game is so horrible broken and terrible that you'll never want to get past the second case with out uninstalling it. 1/10
3324	I'm sure the original version of the game was a perfectly playable game, but I just have to express how terrible this PC port is. No resolution or graphic options unless you download a patch and adjust them manually. Without the patch the game is basically unplayable, and even with it it still has a myriad of issues. The patch makes the game look much better and run faster as well, but after playing it for a bit you will see that there is some sort of memory leak which, after about 10 minutes of gameplay, ends up degrading the performance back to what it was without the patch. This caused me to try and speed from savepoint to savepoint so that I could restart the game to get it back to running efficiently. If that wasn't annoying enough, it takes about 5 minutes to load from cutscene to cutscene, or from a cutscene back to being able to play. I thought the game had frozen, so I just left it while I did something else and came back to find that it was finally playing the cutscene. This made it more tedious to quit and restart the game because the process took about 5 minutes to quit and then get back to the state where you could play it again. Along with all of that, I fell through the floor multiple times when walking through doors, sometimes the quicktime events would not work which was very frustrating especially when you need to do them to avoid dying. I think the story is very intriguing. The dialoge has a bit of broken english, but I think it gives the game a little charm. I would like to finish the story, but dealing with the flaws in the game makes it far too time consuming for me to stand. I'd recommend just watching someone else play it, or maybe getting the original version if you can.
3325	I was really starting to like this game when I realised that there's a major bug with aiming. First I thought I was just really â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dumb and couldn't solve how to get this object down from a tree... you're suppoed to shoot it down but it's â¥â¥â¥â¥ING IMPOSSIBLE WHEN THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING â¥â¥â¥â¥ CAN'T AIM HIGHER THAN COUPLE OF METRES VERTICALLY!!!!!!! If you don't want to lose your wits while trying to fix this bug then don't buy this game. On the other hand if you're one of the lucky ones you may not have to deal with the bug but I wouldn't risk it.
3326	Maybe I missed something, maybe it's some cult classic I just don't get. But this is one of the single most boring games I've played in a while... The pace is so slow, I just couldn't stick with it.
3327	The game is not working.  I don't even think they tried to make it work!
3328	The game itself is great, but playing the PC port was one of the worst gaming experiences I've my life. THIS GAME IS BROKEN DO NOT BUY IT.  Right off the bat the game had problems. It would crash upon starting, and had to be trouble shooted to even work. Once I got the game working, it would periodically crash. At its worst point, I had to download a save file from someone else that was past a crash point just to continue the game.  Here are some of the fun things I did during the course of this game -download a fan made patch to 'fix' things -Run the game in older windows compatability modes to get past crashes -switch the game to windowed mode to get past crashes -lower the resolution to get past crashes -download save files that are past crash points -dig through the game files and repair files in hopes it stops crashes -turn off steam overlay to stop crashes -ask on forums how to get past crashes at specific points  I couldn't even finish the game. I someone made it all the way to the epilogue and hit another crash wall. At this point I couldn't take it anymore and just watched the ending on Youtube.  I tweeted the creator of the game, and he replied that he had nothing to do with the PC port and that its the PC development company's fault. I tweeted the development company and they told me there is nothing they can do because they don't have a development team for Deadly Premonition anymore.  It sucks because the actual game itself is great &amp; unique. Do yourself a favor and get the Xbox 360 or PS3 version instead.  
3329	You can't really fully enjoy the game when the crashes keep you from progressing. Yes, there are a lot of them.
3330	WARNING: For many people the game is unplayable in it's current state, and the developers have officially stopped updating the game:   https://twitter.com/RisingStarGames/status/528158456448970753   DPfix helps with visuals and performance, but the game still crashes often and has numerous unpatched bugs, many which are game breaking. The last update was on November 28th of 2013, since then, development has gone cold with no signs of improvment. Shame, isn't it Zach?
3331	After trying everything, I still can't get the game to work, which is a shame. I'd recommend buying the console game, as the PC Port is beyond broken and a patch to fix the issues seems out of reach. My only consolation is the soundtrack, that alone was worth the couple dollars I paid during the sale.
3332	Chuncky controls, bad voice acting, robotic animation, and poor graphics that makes this game less enjoyable.  The worse part of the game is the weird background music that destroys the immersion of the game. Just imagine that a happy and joyful music that makes you feels like you're playing arcade games with the scary moments in the game, which makes the scares of the game feels nothing.  The game suffers from poor optimization with makes the game running at 40+fps with i7 processor, GTX 960M mobile Nvidia GPU with 12GB of RAM. Sometimes it even drop to 20 fps.    I didn't even know who's Zach is. The male protagonist in this game makes me feel that he's some kind psychopath  
3333	- Game horribly laggy no matter if fulscreen or windowed (like 4 or 5 FPS while Bioshock Infinite turns flawlessly with my config, wtf!) - impossible to change the screen resolution - QWERTY or GTFO (you can bind all keys except for the directions. Wtf again!)   I got this for cheap thanks to halloween sales but I regret it. I want a refund.
3334	The game's not bad. I got it free on PS3. Can't run it on Win 8.1 though. So no recommendation from me.
3335	i was really enjoying it until i encountered a game killing bug wich made progressing past the hospital impossible without crashing . too bad .
3336	Utterly broken and unplayable.
3337	It takes some serious psychic detective work just to get this game to launch.
3338	It's ugly, it's got not no graphics options (stuck at 720p, though there are fanmade fixes), it plays terribly, features average voice acting and is a poor Twin Peaks knockoff. Grab on sale if you're morbidly curious.  3/10
3339	The time played (2h), is the time i spent trying to launch the game, and I am yet to see the menu.  I read the reviews before buying, and everyone complaining about how broken this is, and i mistakenly thought to myself that it was overblown by the community.  Lesson learnt, it is unplayable on my rig. i did every fix on the faqs, and official troubleshootting guide, compatibility mode, fan-made patch, physX.... and the game crashes as soon as it launches  at least i got it on a bundle, so not a lot is lost, but this game at 24.99e is a ripoff in it's current state, in a win10 up to date environment, as of August 2015  update: it starts in win10 with latest nvidia and physx drivers as of date of this edit still plenty of bugs, and 30 seconds black screens i understand by the amount of reviews, that it is a really good game, but the current state of this port is unbearable, so i killed the process in about 15 minutes of broken 'gameplay'
3340	Worst game I have ever played! I am a big fan of mystery/adventure games and this game and controls were absolutley awful and half the time couldn't even make out where I was going and kept bumping into nothing. The 'ghost' at the beginning was laughable and reminded me of something out of the grudge. I did not even finish this game and turned it off after 5 minutes of playing as I was fed up and bored. Sorry but if you are a fan of adventure games like me , I do not recommend this game as it will be a big disappointment. I want a refund even if was Â£1.99
3341	The game itself is great, but playing the PC port was one of the worst gaming experiences I've my life. THIS GAME IS BROKEN DO NOT BUY IT.  Right off the bat the game had problems. It would crash upon starting, and had to be trouble shooted to even work. Once I got the game working, it would periodically crash.

It sucks because the actual game itself is great &amp; unique. Do yourself a favor and get the Xbox 360 or PS3 version instead.  
3342	This game does not work on modern PC's. Will crash on launch. There are a few things I did to get over that but when I finally got into the game the framerate was completely unplayable and controls barely responded. Really disapointing. Another port failure.
3343	Great if you can figure out how to fix the horrendous audio bugs.
3344	The port is horrible, I can't play the video game because, in a determinate moment, the game will not let me play more. Fantastic...   I really wanted play to Deadly Premonition but currently is imposible.
3345	It takes some serious psychic detective work just to get this game to launch.
3346	Bad port of clunky game that belong to PS2. Save money and buy Alan Wake instead.
3347	broken piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥. absolute garbage
3348	Don't believe the hype. This game is about as interesting as a trip to the dentist and about as fun as being kicked in the balls.
3349	I don't know if its the graphics or controls for keyboard but I can't believe I paid for this game. I thought I was going to like it when I got it but am so disappointed and dare I say it even a little frustrated. I wanted so much from this game but in no time at all ended up uninstalling it. WASD are standard movement controls but the other controls are just not for me. If you want / can aim with left ctrl and space bar among other things then get this game.
3350	Silent Hill meets Twin Peaks. Sounds freaking AWESOME, don't it? But let's take a closer look...   Your character is an FBI agent, who has frequent conversations with some imaginary (?) person in his head. This would be a fascinating enough idea...except that he does it RIGHT IN FRONT OF EVERYONE ELSE, and no one flinches an inch. He drinks cup of coffee after cup of coffee just to read the tea leaves at the bottom...in fact, one of the main, recurring 'side-quests' of the game seems to be the eternal quest for a cup of coffee. And when he finds a cup of coffee, or a tin of pickles (branded 'The Pickles' on the label, not bizarrely at all I'm sure you'll agree), we get a spooky little tune to, er, remind us that this is supposed to be a spooky-arsed game even if nothing particularly spooky has happened for the last half-hour of gameplay. WEIRD, maybe...there is weirdness aplenty...but the spookiness is a little more on the sparing side. At least as far in as I have played this game. Maybe I'll try and play it again some other time, but for now I need a break 'cause, quite frankly, MY â¥â¥â¥â¥ING HEAD HURTS. Sincerely.   Here's some of the other madness you'll encounter, should you be brave enough. There's wooden crates, in various public places. You can 'push' them. But instead of pushing them aside to reveal something, like in, say, the early Resident Evil games, you just push AGAINST them until they shatter under the sheer Herculian strength of your besuited character, sometimes revealing cash. Cash you can use to buy live worms and a fishing rod from the strange old lady who runs the huge hotel where no one else is staying, so you can nip out to the back of the hotel and catch yourself some fish. To eat, I presume (I didn't quite muster up the courage and/or patience to try this theory out). There's a couple of bars in town which you can apparently visit, one of which is called...wait for it...The Galaxy Of Terror. Which appears to be an oddball reference to the semi-obscure 80s horror movie of the same name, which I guess is meant to tie in with the recurring thematic of quirky low-budget 80s horror films which is fleshed out further in the conversations our protagonist has with himself/his split personality whilst joy-riding around in a police car which he has freely been given the keys to (along with the apparent permission to blare sirens, beep horns and run into other cars with absolutely no repercussions whatsoever). I mean, c'mon...I love The Deadly Spawn from 1983 as much as the next guy, but I'm not sure I need to hear the name of its director and fascinating little tidbits about it having a completely different crew to its sequel, while I'm supposed to be driving to a police station to find out some information about a murder victim. Whose file has been lost by the nerdy, quite possibly homosexual deputy who then spends hours looking for it while you can pop downstairs for a quick nap in the cells (to replenish your 'tiredness' meter, of course...there's a hunger one too, hence the aforementioned coffee and pickles and fish and, er, lollypops and crap like that as well). Next thing I know, it's 5pm and the police station decides it's closing time - 'come back tomorrow' - and while I'm driving back to the hotel after an amazingly productive day of stealing freshly-made cups of coffee from unoccupied hotel rooms and completely failing to find out ANYTHING whatsoever about the ONLY murder case the sleepy little town has had in eons from none less than the police department, I decide to stop by and investigate a completely random letterbox outside someone's house and find some pistol ammo in it. As you do. Oh, and there's at least five or six cops in the police station at any one time, and if you try to talk to the majority of them your character decides that 'This person probably has nothing to do with the investigation'. I guess they must need all those surplus cops to do traffic duty in a town with absolutely no bloody people in it, and couldn't possibly spare the manpower to contribute to the solving of a perplexing and incredibly rare murder case...   What...you're STILL reading this review? Okay, should I mention some of the technical problems then, like the fact that the mouse is INSANELY oversensitive to the point where your character spins almost 180 degrees with the faintest movement of one's hand - running around is a particularly enjoyable chore herein - even once you reduce the mouse sensitivity to its absolute minimum, which you can only do in the game's launcher, meaning you have to exit the game to perform such a privileged function? Ah, look...seriously...I'm done. I don't even want to think about this any more. Like I said, I HAVE A HEADACHE. I wanted this game to be good. It looked so much like my cup of tea...er, coffee...er, t-tin of pickles...   Oh man, I'm gonna have nightmares tonight. And not the type which I WANT games like this to give me. I'll probably be wandering around an endlessly huge and empty hotel searching for warm beverages and canned food all night. I swear to God, if I develop yet another bloody psychological quirk from this game, like never being able to look a tin of pickles in the face again without suffering a nervous breakdown, I am going to SUE THE DEVELOPERS. I just wanna go to bed, and maybe cry myself to sleep. I can't take it any more. I'm sorry. I just can't...I just can't...  Verdict: 4/10.
3351	Won't even run unless you go to the forums and get instructions for tweaking. Graphics are weak. There is no manual so good luck with that.   There is more time watching poorly animated movies than actually playing.  This game is a BIG disappointment.
3352	The game itself is fun doesn't take itself seriously and offers quite a lengthy campaign, this game has the best main character i have seen for many years in a video game and made me laugh several times, the game is rather strange to describe but i will try if you had silent hill, a cheesy cop show from the 70s and an old gta game then combined them together you would get deadly premonition, The graphics are bad the textures are awful and the controls are clunky but this didn't affect my enjoyment of the game in any way i think this game works because of how bad some of the mechanics are. If you are mad about graphics and smooth mechanics do not buy this game. If you want to play a quirky game with some good humour and a very unique style of gameplay then this is for you. As for the pc port because it is so half baked and doesn't work for me i will say wait for another patch or just skip it on pc you could probably buy the console version for very cheap now which actually works
3353	Thumbs down mainly because horrendous port.  As a port, this is possibly one of the worst port ever in the video game history. Anyone even remotely, vaguely aware of Deadly Premonition should already know by now just how bad the PC port is. Even setting aside the lack of HD graphics, the game runs. like. â¥â¥â¥â¥. It actually suffers from memory leak issue. My personal best time before Crash To Desktop is slightly under 2 hours. On the norm, anything just a bit over 1 hour the game will commit ritual suicide on the dot. Anything related to opening the map screen seems to really exacerbate the leak issue for me, this leads to some very annoying side quests run. Replaying a chapter for side quests sometimes will bug your game out. This is serious game breaking potential bug too. You damn well better make a save backup before you do anything foolish.  As a game, Deadly Premonitions starts out absolutely brilliant. Then it took a wrong turn and ends up on a railroad heading to DBZ town.   The Gold: Really quirky casts WTF is wrong with this music?! The amazing attention to details York's amazing knowledge of old movies   I can certainly see why this game became a cult classic. It has all the lovable and lovably hate-able characters. The flattest character in this game is   the dog  , but I bet even he has ulterior motives deep beneath that   fur coat  . (Actually confirmed by SWERY) The soundtracks have this dissonance to it that it'll play some cheery tunes at some very inopportune times. Too bad this sort of thing doesn't happen toward the end of the game where there are moments where I become very irritated. (More on end game later) A big notable mention is the attention to details of character interactions. Generally, character dialogues of when what where occurred won't be remembered. So in other games there'd be occasions of you've already met this character, even done a few side quests for said person, but the game will still treat you as you've never met him/her unless plot dictates so. Deadly Premonitions is the exact opposite of such syndrome. In fact, it has a near compulsion of keeping track of who/what/when/where. You can physically see NPCs moving from one location to another as they go about their daily business. If the weather changes, their behavior patterns will change as well. That's some impressive bits of details for none big budget games. You'll actually miss some impressive and hilarious nuggets of gold this way if you don't have a habit of exploring and wandering about. I do so enjoy York's car ramblings about old movies as well.   The Unnecessary: Your piddly map screen that can't even fix its orientation Clunky combat and driving controls End game railroading DBZ boss battles and worse dialogue   Time for the really â¥â¥â¥â¥ parts. The controls for this game can be abysmal. The combat is laughably bad. This is PlayStation Resident Evil 1 clunky. The quick turn animation doesn't quick turn my camera as well. I still need to slowly adjust it with my mouse or pad. Aiming is clunky, but at least the game is generously forgiving (until end game bosses.) Driving a car around town proves to be a challenge. This is where the attention to detail bit on the town will drive some people nuts. Greenvile is treated as an actual town, not a crappy rundown composed of just 2 blocks of random shops, houses, and 1 Inn. No. Actual people with their own homes, places where they gather, the works. On paper this sounds like a wonderful thing. HOWEVER, this becomes an issue when your map is forever stuck showing just one tiny bit of the town. The place is HUGE, hardly helpful when you need to get to the far side of the map. The map is NOT fixated to North/South/West/East/Whoville either, it is related to where you are positioned. Thought you got the map figured out? Oops, you moved so it changed orientation. This is Google Map without the actual GPS telling you where to go. There's just a big fat arrow pointing vaguely on the horizon on where your next plot point is. You can argue they are trying to encourage exploration, but being stuck in a game with memory leak problem... Oh, your car also has this weird tendency to do some weird ragdoll physics; hit some invisible or tiny pixels in the road and spin off the road. Car controls itself is pretty damn clunky as well. If you are doing the sidequests that involve racing, this can get frustrating really quick especially in the downtown area.  This is a sad mention, but I actually have an issue with the plot execution. Not because it is ridiculous, but how it really spirals downwards near the end from poor execution. From the outset, the game encourages you to freely explore the town and do your own thing. You can jump on and off the investigation train at any time, no time limit is ever imposed on you. Shoot the breeze with the local crazies. Wow, there's a crazy killer on the loose. So what, I still have time to go fishing, sort boxes at your local store, eat a delicious sandwich made of sin at the diner. Hahaha. So what happens near the end? This is when the game takes itself too damn serious. You are being bound, gagged, and railroaded to the final boss bum rush mode. You want to stop and buy supplies? No dice. You want to redo some old dungeons for cards and infinite weapons? Too bad, so sad. My problem with this game is they've put the Point of No Return a few chapters too damn early. I'm in a game with big memory leak issue. I'm constantly worried about the game choking on itself in the middle of a dungeon, or the last bouts of bosses. Oh ye gods, the bosses. The freaking bosses also have the RPG syndrome of multiple forms, with a side order of crap dialogues. 'Bwahahaha, you thought you killed me? BEHOLD! My second and mightier form!' You kill the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. ':cough hack: You... You thought you beat me?! Foolish mortal! Now I'll reveal you my true self!!!1111' â¥â¥â¥â¥. Me. This is padding. You are actually padding the damn game. Any boss battle with more than 2 forms is considered obnoxious. Your boss dialogue is contrived, half â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, simply moustache twirling level evil. Where's that button for taunting or â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ slapping my opponent!? Have you dealt with the final boss in Ace Attorney Investigator? Yeah, that really dragged on didn't it? Remember: time crunch, memory leak, game explode? Ugh. I've actually had to skip quite a few vital plot scenes before the boss battles for fear of the game crashing. (and I couldnât stomach the big badâs writing anymore) It turned out to be a smart move, because it DID drag on. Why why WHY? You had such a great start...     Actual plot spoiler tag, do not click unless you know what you are doing.   You know that bit where you become the Raincoat Killer? Looking back, I probably would've enjoyed the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of that if I wasn't in such a hurry to get to the next save point before the game crash.  
3354	Do not buy this game, it Does Not start.   (I also tried to contact developers but No response or support from them at all)
3355	Game crashes directly after the splasyscreen when I hit PLAY. Nothing working to get it running. I wonder how crap like this ever went through Steam's Greenlight process at all.
3356	serious issues on windows 10, framerate is horrible and is compleatly unplayable.
3357	it is a great game but one of the laziest ports in existance, game is a broken mess and the devs knew it.  it might better on console untill either that magic patch arrives either by the lazy doubtful dev team or more than likely fan patching .  as at the moment there is far far far to much to do to make this game work and far to much to do outside of the game to make it finishable
3358	So somehow this game magically decided to work after hours of trying to get it run, it still crashes here and there but at least I can actually play now.  Amazing, amazing game but save yourself the trouble and get it on console, if you can't then go ahead knowing you may not be able to actually play it properly with dozens and problems, bugs and crashes. It ruins the experience of this amazing game.   I still think this game shouldnt be allowed on Steam with how broken it is and should be looked at again. Overall, it's not worth going through the trouble of getting this game to work during the early stages of the game, despite how amazing the story and characters are.
3359	Oh man where to start.... What a mess of a game.  Its riddled with gamebreaking bugs, youll have to download other stuff to make it work, controls are clunky all around, graphics are dull, the music is attrocious (whistling song) youll get 3/4 skit songs that will play the whole game, so annoying and the monsters are far from scary. The only reason i got this is because it was like 99 cents and everyone praised the story. After trying to play this, i just ended up saying ''â¥â¥â¥â¥ this'', but i still wanted to know the follow up to the story. So i went on youtube as other reviewers suggested and watched the whole 5h borefest it was. The more the story advances the more WTF moments pop up, until the end..... oh my what an end.....the kind of end that makes you want to cry because you realize what a waste of time it all was.  Save yourself money (even if its 99 cents, its not worth it)  Save yourself time (the story is â¥â¥â¥â¥ anyways)  Enjoy an other game, there is trully nothing here but a borefest filled with a non sensical â¥â¥â¥â¥ up of a story.  Not recommended.
3360	I have played this game before steam using GOG. Back then I really thought I should try it since everyone was talking about how its one of the best mystery game out there and how funny and cheesy it is. So I downloaded the game . When I went to start it, it would not start so I modded it and it worked out great with no glitches and no frame drops, but why the hell did I go through the trouble of doing all that? the game it self looks absolutely terrible for a 2010 game, and the shooting and melee mechanics look like butchered resident evil 4 mechanics that should have been fixed 11 YEARS AGO (when re4/biohazard 4 came out). The game trys to be a fresh new start and try a whole new genre of mystery and detective work with resident evil mechanics. but the game turned out aweful looking, broken, boring and dull. Not even minding the bugs, the story itself is decent but not even worth the trouble of fixing the game to play, and the interesting characters are the only thing that basically make the game. People say its good because of the many random encounters that dont make sense and the fresh ideas put into the game but the random encounters are not even funny and makes the game look like crap. If you're gonna play the game stick to console and also if you're looking for a game that focuses on mystery using the atmosphere and the enivronment then do not get this game, its looks like it was put together in a month. People say its one of those game that its so bad its good but I just do not see it. I personally would give the game a 4.5/10 for the characters but for everything else the devs made it look like they didnt even try.   TL;DR Buyers beware. Do not even accept this game for free and put your time trying to fix the bugs to play it, its not even worth it. If you want to play it, play it on Xbox 360 ( I heard the ps3 version is also broken.)
3361	I'm sorry that I recommended this game about a year ago when it was on sale on the humble bundle store for about $1. I thought they had put more effort into the port than they did. But as it turns out it's just yet another bad port. Bad in a way that only japanese studios that regret their decision to take console exclusive deals can do.  Got it running by breaking physx for other games on my system that link to it. Only to see that the resolution is hardcoded to 1280x720. I was aware of dpfix. But even though it evidently loads the symbols just fine (as indicated by not segfaulting) it just sits forever eating my cycles. Likely caused by a recent update.  There are people on the forums trying to defend these incompetent developers. They shouldn't. They're only further ruining Steam. Having a quirky game that likes to have a bit of fun despite itself is one thing (and is why I came to want it in the first place) but having a buggy piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ maintained by incompetent developers is another, and believe me they are incompetent.  The fact that libs that override d3d9 symbols exist in the first place is evidence of that. As the complexity of the problem goes up so does the complexity of the override libs. But ones like these -though written by undoubtedly competent people- merely provide basic features that the game should have in the first place. Like adding a second step that adjusts resolution based on values given in a config file.    Edit:  I was able to fix the issue causing the game to just sit there eating cycles and have it running in my native resolution. I'm sure the game will be as fun as I figured it would be but my review above still applies. The short of it is: Don't bother if you're not comfortable having a game that isn't playable right after download from steam. It's going to take a bit to both get it to actually run without segfaulting and get it aesthetically reasonable (meaning native resolution of your monitor and properly saturated environments).  Had I known this port was as bad as it was I wouldn't have encouraged developers who do crap like this by giving them money. I suggest you don't make the same mistake.
3362	Horrible Graphics. Horrible, HORRIBLE Voice Acting, like they translated Japanese-English 1:1. Controls and interface are awkward at best. While I'm not far into the game I have to say the story makes absolutely NO SENSE AT ALL. Combat is.. well.. clunky and boring. Unless you're into this kind of games and don't mind playing in japanese you should really avoid this.
3363	It's still unplayable with DPfix too but I suggest to buy it and play it as long as it works fine. And after that watch 'Deadly Premonition The Movie' on YouTube.  It's about story, gameplay is pure garbage.
3364	serious issues on windows 10, framerate is horrible and is compleatly unplayable.
3365	Looks interesting but its broken and not just for me.  7 to 17 FPS with all suggested fixes applied and it appears to have a memory leak.
3366	Amazing game, but probably the worst PC port ever. You're lucky if you can even get it to run. Save yourself the bother and just buy it on a console instead.
3367	0/10 Not working on Windows 10!!!!!!!!!!!
3368	Awful game, not the story but the terrible optimization, the lack of Customizing, the clunky inventory, the crashes and overall crumminess of it. Feels like a very old resident evil game.

3370	one of the the crappiest games ive ever played. Looks like pre PS2 graphics, horrid controls, and the most disjointed and impossible to understand game ive ever played. it makes me sick that this game is in my libary. i will be contacting steam for a refund, or at the vary least have it removed from my account. thats how bad this game is, id rather eat it than to suffer the humiliation of having this on my account. the devs should be ashamed of makeing something so horrible.
3371	Bugs.   Bad controls including mouse lag and other stupid things.  Annoying screeching loop while driving.  Driving is badly done.   Really long boring animations.  Stupid combat.   Horrible UI.  Not really immersive. Or rather all the garbage just constantly breaks immersion.  The story is a bit interesting but the game is just terrible. I'd rather read this in a book than play this game.   
3372	Just do yourself a favor and watch an LP of the game if it interests you, even after trying out DSFix the game crashes at the start of a cutscene in the hospital, making progress impossible. I only paid 3 dollars for the game and I still feel cheated.
3373	This game is trash. Crashes and hangs if you don't do things in a gentle manner. Framerates are 'cinematic' even after applying dsFix. I wish I used the money to buy a burg instead.
3374	Great game but it does not start after the setting screen it just crashes thank God i only payed $2
3375	Took a lot of messing about and reading guides to just get this game to get past the intro movie. After that, wanting to use a controller, the controller button in settings was disabled so I just uninstalled out of frustration.  I guess I got a few hours out of my money doing all that...
3376	I have no idea if this plays well or not. It runs at least, contrary to what others have reported. However, it does not recognise XBOX controller at all, there is no way to remap the keys, it has poorly dubbed voiceovers akin to a film originally produced in another language, the graphics are clearly directly ported from something like a ps2 with no way to increase resolution, and (one of my all time pet hates) there is no way to turn off subtitles. For some not being able to use a controller OR remap keys might not be a deal breaker but since I am left handed the whole awsd extended map is a complete btfk for me. Even at 90% off I would advise you not to bother.
3377	Broken from the start. After downloading the game it would not launch at all. To fix that you have to run dplauncher as administrator. Then i calibrated my wireless 360 controller and launched the game after that and set my control config to joystick in the launcher. Buttons worked fine and the game is advertised with 'Full Controller Support'. RIght when i gained control of the character i could not move but the buttons worked. I downloaded and installed the dpfix and it didnt do anything. I really wanted to play this but i only paid $2.49 and i wouldnt recommend buying it at that price. I guess i'll just buy the ps3 version.
3378	I bought this after playing the Xbox version, which was good but had a few minor glitches. The Directors Cut has so many glitches that it makes the game unplayable. The map screen constantly crashes the game, the inventory screen doesn't recognise items nor does the item storage boxes - which means I can't equip things I need. The cars drive like busses and topple over at relatively slow speed, NPC's aren't where they're supposed to be, some of the internal buildings have bad graphics - 'daylight' streaming in from windows is green. In my view, this game shouldn't have been released with so many bugs, is a waste of money and impossible to play due to constant crashing. Don't buy it and get the Xbox version instead.
3379	I was really excited to play this, but it's so poorly optimized that I can't even launch it, even with DPFix and all the PhysX hurdles I had to jump over.  That's $2.50 I'm never going to get back. Get the console version instead.
3380	This game turned out to be unfinishable for me. During the final boss fight you have to aim down, but you just can't. Tried this with mouse, tried this with controller, tried bizzare compatibility mode suggestion. Completely broken, 14 hours wasted.
3381	I really wanted to play this game, after having watched a full LP of it. It really seems like a unique experience, despite its many many many apparent flaws. However, after an hour or two of launching, tweaking, relaunching, browsing numerous forum threads, and generally throwing everythign I can think of at this thing, I CANNOT get it to function properly, be it running with a decent framerate or even properly recognizing my controller's analog sticks and d-pad (standard 360 pad). Even after trying every downloadable fix, and recommendation, I have not been able to play any of this game, so I obviously can only recommend you stay far far away from this particular version. If you want to check it out, get it on PS3 or 360. The devs deserve none of your money for this non-functional port.
3382	Amazing game, but probably the worst PC port ever. You're lucky if you can even get it to run. Save yourself the bother and just buy it on a console instead.
3383	Do not buy this game. Crashes all the time.
3384	0/10 Not working on Windows 10!!!!!!!!!!!
3385	i wouldnt recommend this game for now there is alot fps problems, controller problems, so just wait for fixes on game first
3386	Great game, worst port EVER.
3387	Doesn't seem to work regardless of re-instal et al.
3388	just crashed! ... good story but somes bugs
3389	Bugs.   Bad controls including mouse lag and other stupid things.  Annoying screeching loop while driving.  Driving is badly done.   Really long boring animations.  Stupid combat.   Horrible UI.  Not really immersive. Or rather all the garbage just constantly breaks immersion.  The story is a bit interesting but the game is just terrible. I'd rather read this in a book than play this game.   
3390	I bought this after playing the Xbox version, which was good but had a few minor glitches. The Directors Cut has so many glitches that it makes the game unplayable. The map screen constantly crashes the game, the inventory screen doesn't recognise items nor does the item storage boxes - which means I can't equip things I need.

3391	I may be harsh - looks bad, plays bad and simply was unable to hold my interest for more than an hour. My opinion might change, I will try and play more with it - but as it stands right now this game is what I call bad. Or maybe I was expecting too much. ---------------------------- I gave it another (short as it turned out) shot. No change: crap is crap. Outdated looks, animation is embarassing, textures are bleak... was this a PS1 game? PC version needs extra utils to actually 'run'... some bugs here and there (maybe more to come but frankly I cannot be bothered to play more....) Crashes? Just some - and only _if_ you get the thing to launch :-) In my opinion this 'game' is not worth playing, not even if it was free. As for it being the Twin Peaks of PC games... poor David Lynch - that statement is an insult. Maybe the story was supposed to be like TP? I will never be able to tell.
3392	This game is so unplayable with its extremely slow frame rate and bad graphics. Just don't buy it !!
3393	if the developers are willing to release a port this poor and expect people to pay full price for it they simply do not deserve the money. avoid this game.
3394	well the game doesn't work how do i get my money back
3395	Don't get me wrong, the game itself is remarkably good but the PC port is just insanely terrible and utterly garbage! It's truly one of the worst PC ports in history, imagine a mix of Resident Evil 4 &amp; Dark Souls PTD ports and make it a hundred times worse. It's terrible in every single aspect you could imagine and  so broken that it's  LITERALLY  UNPLAYABLE :   Performance : Extremely terrible, couldn't be any worse. I can't even find a right word to describe how terrible it is! It barely runs at 10 FPS on a modern PC without mods. Well to be honest, it doesn't even run at all without mods. You'd hard a really hard time even trying to run the game without crashing, not to mention you will have to use Compatibility Mode and reinstall nVidia Physix just to get it to run.  You probably have to use MODs just to be able to launch!  And that's not all, Loading times are infuriating, especially the invisible loadings between each cutscene which could last up to 8 minutes! You'll just sit there staring at the black screen thinking the game's frozen but it's actually a terribly long loading!  There are countless super-long invisible loading times!  And that's not all! There's one more bonus for you:  Game constantly crashes every once in a while for no reason!    You're better off playing it on the console rather than buying this terrible and utterly unplayable piece of crap on PC. 
3396	Don't buy this on PC. Get it for consoles right away.
3397	This is game is buggy beyond belief. stay away. grab the original version of the game on Xbox 360 if you must play it, the PS3 director's cut is also buggy as all hell.
3398	I would love to recommend this, but its probably the worst PC port in exsistance, which is kind of fitting with the game it self.
3399	I'd enjoy to play the game but the audio keeps skipping. I bought this bad game because I wanted to play it; not to have a stroke everytime I want to watch acutscene. Jeesh, don't buy this game till they patch it.
3400	Will not function despite everything I do. That includes known fixes regarding fixing NVIDIA programs to mods needed to make it run to blood sacrifices. Buy at your own risk.
3401	I was really forward looking playing this little gem. But, was I in for a surprise. This little 'gem' is in fact just a little turd. First, it runs just in 720p, except you got the fix, and the in-game-mechanics aren't great either, driving physics from hell (and there are RACES, who would want to do that?). and it crashes so every often..my game is now broken to the extend that I can't play any further. It crashes after a cutscene, when it's loading...so, please, DO NOT BUY!! cheers, Sam
3402	cant even get this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ to launch. why are you selling this broken crap? can i have my money back?
3403	Literally the worst PC port I've ever played.
3404	This port gave me cancer.
3405	Unfortunatly a subpar port, if a ptch is realised then consider picking it up.
3406	Don't waste your money on this â¥â¥â¥â¥, it's worst port i have ever seen. Horribly broken game. No patch in nearly a year to fix this mess. Oh and botched controller support to put it bluntly it doesn't â¥â¥â¥â¥ing work!!!! so ignore the store page. â¥â¥â¥â¥ you rising star games you theiving â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, you might aswell have mugged me in the streets. Never buying any of your stuff again as i know it's a brand of lazy developers who can't be bothered to fix their own mess.
3407	I'm loving this game, having a lot of fun, the weird kind of humor, the tense atmosphere, but still I don't recommend this game. It crashes frequently, and since the game doesn't have a auto-save system, I lost about 2-3 hours of gameplay. I hope they start fixing this crashes, because the game itself (storyline, gameplay) is great, but the crashes can be disappointing.
3408	This game actually looked a lot better before I played it. The game has a fairly 'fear-like' storyline. The storyline is somewhat nice and fits it's theme, but the game itself is boring. The combat of the game is very complicated having to hold around 3 on your keyboard just to aim down when shooting. The game itself is fairly weak and could be improved greatly.
3409	Unfortunately Zach, I just can't recommend this game. Sure, it has some of the goofiest writing I've ever seen, and the music seems to become inappropriately cheery in scenes where a murder has just taken place, but this port is awful. It crashed at least 15 times in my playthrough, sometimes well after my last save point, causing me to lose a lot of progress. The DPfix mod helps make the game look decent, but the game itself is just way too unstable. Get the XBOX 360 version if you just have to see what all the fuss is about.
3410	Never got past the intro thanks to a regular crash. Of course I am not one to give up easily, so I tried 7 more times, using dpfix, using compatibility modes, fiddling with NVIDIA settings, launching stuff as Admin and changing between windowed and fullscreen mode. In the end I sat in the launcher for a few hours to get the cards and then moved the game to my 'Trash' category, because that's what it is.  Edit after all those months : Thanks to a forum thread the thing finally started to work. It required me to uninstall the LAV codecs I had installed. I' guess getting the game to work is already part of the gaming experience :l
3411	Crashes at after intro cut scene, only fix is to uninstall codecs and filters......not happening. I guess this means that PS3 version it is.
3412	The twist at the end is that Suzuki-kun has been dead all these years and Mamiko only saw him because she is crazy. The boat at the end represents their last moment together before Mamiko drowned Suzuki-kun
3413	Utterly broken, with showstopping bugs.
3414	poor voice acting &amp; plot. Stupid gaming mech wow
3415	this game is a real waste of time
3416	  Deadly Premonition * N/A 
3417	This is officially the worst game I've ever played. Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.  It's easy to imagine that the early design discussions went something like this:   'I have an idea for a game! And by idea, I mean let's copy something. How about we turn that weird 90s TV show by David Lynch into a game!'  'You mean Twin Peaks?'  'Yeah!'  'Twin Peaks is about an FBI agent investigating a murder in a small town in the Pacific Northwest. It's a mystery, but mostly a character drama. What would the player fight in this game? There's not much action in the show.'  'Zombies.'  'Ok...are we going to explain to the player why there are zombies?'  'No! I don't wanna! Let's just make it so the zombies are only visible to the main character. That way we don't have to explain why the rest of the world doesn't know there's a zombie apocalypse.'  'So every combat section of the game takes place inside the players head?'  'Yeah. Head zombies.'  'Got it. So how does the player get around?'  'It's open world.'  'Like GTA? You can drive?'  'Yes, except you can only drive from a first-person view, you can only drive certain cars, and they'll each go an incredibly slow speed and flip over all the time for no logical reason. Oh! And the cars will include an incredibly small gas tank that you have to use in-game money to fill up at the one and only gas station in town.'  'And you can go anywhere?'  'Sure! Except if you get out of the car in areas where we're too lazy to implement pathing or textures we'll fine you for being stranded and magically teleport you to a random location. And - I almost forgot - there are invisible walls everywhere.'  'Nice touch. Gotta have invisible walls. Will there be a fast travel system to avoid all the monotony?'  'Definitely. But we'll lock it for most of the game until the player completes an obscure side quest.'  'Why obscure?'  'Well the side quests will only be available depending on the weather conditions. We're implementing  dynamic weather .'  'Oooooooooo.'  'Yeah, buzzwords. But since it's weather and the player obviously has no control over it, they probably won't encounter any sidequests on their own. They'll be basically impossible to find without looking up. Did I mention there's a time system too? And the side quests are also dependent on that? It complements the weather.'  'That's so real. Just so real. Can the player control the time at all?'  'Well they can sleep, but only at pre-designated areas that we'll make sure are very inconveniently placed. And if the player doesn't want to sleep, we'll make them! If they stay up after midnight the zombies will come out and attack the town!'  'I thought they were just in his head? And you know vampires are the monsters that come out at night, not zombies.'  'Don't question my inconsistencies! We'll also make the player tired if he doesn't get enough sleep. It'll slow him down and eventually start draining his health. The same for food. You have to eat. If you literally do nothing and keep the game running you'll die in under an hour. Just like real life!'  'So the player has to manage food and sleep levels, with a limited inventory and only specific, far away places they can rest or buy food?'  'Exactly!'  'This game sounds truly awful. There's no way I'm going to play it.'  'Oh I'm not going to play it either. But we can still sell it: just call it  art .'   On a meta level, the PC version has all the problems Dark Souls did: terrible graphics, awful mouse support, and constant, ever-present crashing. You're going to need third-party hacks to even get it to run. In the process of getting my 100% playthrough the game crashed over 100 times (yes, I started counting). Developers: shame, shame on you.  At one point I had a save file that would crash exactly five seconds after I loaded it. I almost gave up at that point. Luckily I discovered that sprinting inside prevented the crash, and I happened to be only about four seconds from a door.  How I wish I could get the hours spent playing this back, but I wanted to give the game a chance and by the time I realized it was never going to explain anything or get any better I was so far in I figured I might as well finish it. That's a lesson in not trusting my own instincts early on.  The story and setting are so close to Twin Peaks that I think there might be a legitimate plagary case here. Additionally, it's like the creators of the game don't understand storytelling fundamentals, writing dialogue, or even how to make games fun. Your arsenal includes weapons with infinite ammo, and despite the bad controls that simple fact makes the combat trivial. It seems like such an odd choice to provide infinite ammo but then make the player have to manage food. It's tiresome and does not add to the believability or realism of this utterly unreal world. It's like this game was trying to combine every genre: third-person shooter, open world, adventure, survival horror. But in the end it did all of them poorly.  This isn't groundbreaking. It's not art. It's just bad.
3418	I thought that Resident Evil Revelations was a horribly generic version of Resident Evil but this game takes the cake. Made in 2009, then re-released in this HD version in late 2013, it looks, sounds, and feels like a game from no later than 2005. The graphics and character movement are basically updated versions of controls and graphics from Resident Evil 2/3. The graphics look a thousand times better in the screen shots on the store page than in the actual game. I bought the game because it looked good in the screen shots but boy was I wrong. Thankfully I only paid $2.50. But I do not judge the overall quality of a game based on graphics, although it certainly does suck when the graphics suck. The character and enemy movement, shooting, melee attacking, effects, everything feels much, much older than 2009. However I am not really complaining about it just pointing it out, because obviously a game that was released in 2009 for only $20 at the time does not exactly scream high quality. Either way, it should be technologically advanced to that year, not take a step four years backwards.  The shooting and melee attacking feels very stiff and generic. Enemies being hit by your bullets/weapons is just laughably generic. The sound is forgettable and the music is ear bleedingly bad. The music that plays while talking to people in town during cut scenes sounds like music straight from an episode of Leave it to Beaver. Much of the cut scenes are unnecessarily padded with total nonsense like âman this biscuit is good. Where can I get these in town?â âwell actually I um... I baked them myselfâ. Or pretty much the entire conversation with the old lady at the long dinner table early on.  I would love to give the game a further chance but I am without doubt that it will just get more silly as time rolls on. I do not expect it to get even the slightest bit better, especially since I have already seen how horribly generic combat and character movement are and those things simply cannot improve. It is also not a pure survival horror game. It is about 50% adventure, 50% real game. I separate âreal gameâ from âadventureâ because adventure games do not have real gameplay. In an adventure game you just walk around and find clues and objects to use later and talk to people and watch a lot of cut scenes. This game has a ton of that. It is not too much of a gripe though considering that when you do get to actually experience combat, it sucks as well. The real deal breaker was one of the worst problems I have ever seen in a game: when I got into the police car to drive, a terrible, ear piercing screeching sound was playing looped nonstop. I checked the forum and it is a sound glitch that can be fixed by setting your speakers from 5.1 to stereo. I do not care what game it is, I am not going to go into the control panel to redo my sound setup each time I switch to a certain game. And besides, my speakers are configured to 5.1 but I have a audio control panel app for my sound card that lets me switch to stereo, headphones, or whatever, and I had it set to headphones since I was wearing headphones while playing the game so who knows, who cares. If it is something that I had to actually set to stereo in the control panel sound setup options for speakers, there is like I said no way in hell I would ever do that for any game, and would never have to for any other game for that matter. Only this one, no thanks. So that horrible sound problem sealed the nail in the coffin for this game.  I realize it has a cult following, and it is not a horrible game (besides the seriously unbearable sound screech problem when driving), but I do not see the point in bothering with something so barely decent when many much better options exist for your time to be much more well spent. Resident Evil 4, 5, 6, and Revelations are all far superior games and are all available on steam. So with those games and a few other survival horror games out there also if you look, there is no point whatsoever in wasting your time with something as heavily mediocre as this.  Painfully generic, 5/10
3419	Twin Peaks + Silent Hill.  this game is like strong black coffee: enjoyable, but not everyone would like it, or even be able to stomach a tiny amount of it.  it's got more hardware issues than a customer support center, and wasn't very stable or well-coded to begin with when it was 360-exclusive.  Stylish as HELL though. I'm loving everything about it in spite of its awful flaws. i can't wholly say it's a game for everybody.
3420	too buggy, controller not working, lazy pc port
3421	This game is just terrible.
3422	Piece of trash. Blurry graphics and unfinished. Many bugs and glitches.
3423	  F.K in the coffee and that is all.
3424	Dun like the weird controls. Something ain't right
3425	I forget to save for 3 hours and a fence appeared a few feet infront of me and I exploded 10/10. Other than that the port is â¥â¥â¥â¥ and it looks like an upscaled dreamcast game. The shooting is resident evil 4-esc. The story features your typical japanese wackyness that you find in a suda 51 or early Dead rising game. Is it worth 25 dollars? No.
3426	Where do I even start with this? Ah, how about from the moment I double click on the icon to start the game:  1. The launcher says at the bottom D-pad: Select Option and A: Confirm even with no controller plugged in. 2. Check box in the settings menu of the launcher is already checked for Full Screen mode 3. Press Play and the game starts in a bordered 720p window on my 1440p monitor. 4. Get to main menu, can't use my mouse. In fact there isn't even a cursor. Have to use keyboard arrow keys to navigate 5. Go to options and see there aren't any graphics settings whatsoever. 6. Quit the game. Cry.  At the time I wrote this review it's on sale for $2.49 which is 90% off it's regular asking price of $25. $25 for this? Even at $2.49 it's a massive rip off. Avoid at all cost or risk a heart attack trying to play whatever the hell this is.
3427	Stupid 3rd person view! In RL i have good aim, point blank as well as long range. And in a good 1st person view game that shows. I'm not about to let 3rd person view ruin my aim.  Besides, this is a small screen what can not be enlarged to full screen. The bones of decaying humanoids apparently are stronger then a steel pipe. Wasting bulets on extremely slow monsters? Just a plain stupid game.
3428	ive never been so annoyed by a game.  terrible port that makes you feel like playing a PS1 game with a raddled controller and broken fingers. flickering textures, low quality graphics and sounds, slow moving mouse, weird keyboard settings...  but thats not enough! you also get monotonous dialogues and a narcotic story. the gameplay is so weird and slow, i have no idea why this appears in the 'ACTION' category.  worst about this game is the music. pitch and melody forced me to turn it off completely. the composer must have been some suicidal crackhead in a self doubt delirium. ( i bet that the same guy also created the story layout for this game...)  honestly, i expected not much, but even this low expectations got disappointed by this game.   dont buy it, i beseech you!
3429	stupid game doesn't work! crap crashes before you can play, the waste of space piece of garbage.
3430	Silent hill 2 if it was directed by Tommy wiseau.  For someone who loves investigation games, this was far too goofy, and you can find out who the real killer is the moment you meet him.
3431	Clunky graphics, bad controls ... avoid
3432	Patched...  playable.... under review...  Rating: ?/10 Value: ?
3433	Screw that game.
3434	The game is a fine, campy adventure with some bad combat up until it suddenly pulls out transmisogynistic tropes. You'll hear people praise it as a cult classic without ever mentioning that. Avoid it.
3435	Holy God, this is bad. This game has some of the worst controls I have ever seen in a video game. On top of this the voice acting and lipsynch are garbage. Why does this game have any positive reviews at all?
3436	Ok... so let me say this: I love Twin Peaks.  But this. This â¥â¥â¥â¥ is not Twin Peaks.  I couldn't get past the forest at the beginning as this game is radiating cancer.  Maybe I'll try it again in the future.  It'll probably kill me when I do.
3437	Another crappy game people want to like because someone told them they should, it's boring, has terrible graphics and the controls don't work as they should but that could be fixed with a patch. It's definitely different from lots of games that get released and I'm sure some people will find a reason to play it but I prefer to spend my limited free time playing GOOD games.
3438	Steam told me to recommend this game to my friends. But I won't. You shouldn't play it. Not on steam, not on any other platform, because devs hate you. They'd r*pe your dog and houseplants if they had a chance. Yes, they are that incompetent, ignorant and they are okay with that. This port is A LOT worse than Dark Souls port. It's can challenge the worst ports like DMC3 or original RE4 release and effin' win hands down. I'm not kidding. And you know, xbox and ps3 versions weren't really more of a better game. No, I'm not talking about story writer - the story is actually interesting, the Twin Peaks atmosphere mixed with Silent Hill in open-world detective horror with a whole lot of WTF moments. But you'll get r*ped with a baseball bat for it. Go on, you've been warned.
3439	Cannot recommend this game. Nothing fun here for me.
3440	I paid for this game in the hopes to actually play it. IT DOESNT WORK!!!! They took my money and the game doesnt work at all. Feel as if I was knowingly robbed, because Steam already knew this didn't work.
3441	The game is great, until it crashes and never works again
3442	No clue about the content of the game -- after installing (and restarting PC) it is unplayably laggy. Which I would have read the review section first, my own fault.
3443	I can't give an honest review of the game because I haven't actually played it - so keep that in mind. I haven't played it because each time I try I physically cannot keep going, it's so terribly cheesy and awful I can't help but turn it off immediately. I hope it's good when you actually start playing - but the cheese factor is too real for me :-(
3444	Do NOT Buy!  I was lucky enough to get the game running but it's a disaster of a port. There isn't a resoulution option so you're stuck at the 720p console port resolution. It should run with a great framerate at least, right? Wrong. I was getting around 10 fps. When I wasn't moving the camera. When I was closer to 5 fps. I can't really review much else about the game. It's not playable like this..
3445	A very strange game that had me laughing for all the wrong reasons. The story is rediculasly slow with the actions being even slower. I gave up hope when the game had me looking for a key for a long time through different rooms, the door animation being about 30 seconds of him opening them, this was the final nail.
3446	I'd want to play all the way through this game, but the game decided to corrupt my save file. And no, the game is not so good, that i'm willing to go through it again. If you want to try this out, DON'T GET THE PC VERSION. Any other version is better than this! Horrible fluctuating framerate, constant crashes and lacking in basic PC settings like resolution. Just don't.
3447	Deadly Premonition is a fantastic game and a must play, I HIGHLY recommend it. However, the PC port is pretty much broken. You're lucky if the game even launches and when it does, it is riddled with bugs, glitches and contantly crashes. The game itself is REALLY good, but I've never seen a PC port this broken. It's exactly like the Dark Souls port but worse. A fantastic game that it ruined by a horrible port. What a shame. Stick with the console version.
3448	This is the japanese indie love child of Twin Peaks and Silent Hill. A pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ lovechild, but still somewhat awesome and adorable none-the-less, provided that you can patch it up enough to get it to even run in the first place.    THIS GAME IS BOTH BRILLIANT AND HORRENDOUS  105 hours. A regular triple A game takes about 44 continuous hours to complete if you take your time with it. While you can certainly beat this game in less time without all the side-missions, this game drags on for 105 hours if you want to 100% it. ...and when you're done, you breathe a sigh of relief.  I'm done making excuses for this game. This game features invisible shrubberies, and levitating trees and fences. Cars sometimes fall off the map, straight through the street. The game also more or less requires you to wait several days for a certain side-mission to open up. (It has to be raining during three specific hours, three times, you have to have certain specific items at these times, that you better look up in a walkthrough beforehand, and if you don't want to smoke, that can mean waiting many, many hours IN REAL LIFE. That means leaving your computer and go do the dishes. I means going to the store to buy food in real life. Oh, but the game doesn't tell you, is that the days where the side mission is said to open up, isn't the days where it ACTUALLY opens up.)  Everything that can be broken in this game, is broken. People say that it's just a 'bad port'. No, this is the ULTIMATE bad port. This is a nearly playable port! This is the circus freaks of bad ports, of a game that was a circus freak to begin with!    HOW TO GET IT TO RUN  In order to get this game to even get past the loader setup without crashing, you need to 'repair' its PhysX file. (See description in the Steam forums.)  Then, in order to improve the graphics with custom resolutions and antialiasing, you should probably want to install the DPfix fan fix. ...but you need to edit the fix ini file to a certain resolution. (Also, if you set the details to 'Ultra' in that file, the graphics will crash.)  Now you can get the intro to play, so that the game doesn't crash on start-up. There's still the issue with random crashes in-game, as well as the issue with the car sound.  In order to fix the sound, you will need to set your 7.1 or 5.1 surround headphones back to 2.0 stereo headphones in the headphone's own settings.  As for the random crashes, I have been able to establish two causes. First of all, the game was a memory leak that will slowly but surely eat up RAM until it crashes. When this occurs depends on how much free RAM you have.  Second of all, you need to set the game file (DP.exe) to run in a Windows 98 compatibility mode. You will be able to play the game up to Chapter 6 without doing so, with only occationally buggy inventory menus as an ecceft,, but at that chapter the game will finally crash consistently.  If you experience further problems, there are talks about further fixes that you can do, such as getting the game to recognize higher memory adresses by downloading a third-party tool.  However, this will NOT fix all the crashes. Try rebooting your computer if the game starts crashing too much. Nobody knows why this is required. It could be that the game would require continuous unfragmented areas of memory in RAM.
3449	In principle it is probably a 'thumbs up' game. Alas, it wont run on my PC, no matter the tweaks with PhysX, DPFix, etc. pp. Hence the thumbs down. Apparently it is a poor console port to the PC.
3450	i whant my money back the game is bugd and and i cant play it i reinstalt it 5 times i done 100 difrent stuff to it and dont whant to work so is the suporters of the game see the massage. I WANT MY MONEY BACK !!!!!!
3451	Wow this is why i should read comments this was not expected, stay away from this game it just likes to crash....alot.
3452	Tried this game out after reading a few of the positive reviews even though they mentioned the game was buggy and the controls could be quite awkward, but that the main story made up for it. Sadly I just couldn't get into it, every line of dialogue was more awkward than the controls and every character felt like they'd struggle to get cast in a B-movie.  If you must try it grab it in a sale, but dont expect much.
3453	What a disappointment... Did those developers really think it's cool to copy what everything Twin Peaks has done? Talking about a total ripoff here! Anyone who says this game isn't a ripoff is either in denial or didn't watch a single episode of Twin Peaks...  I really wanted to enjoy this game but I couldn't. The execution is really good but the tired story has completely ruined it.  pros:  +atmosphere +good soundtrack +cool protagonist +good gameplay  cons:  -boring missions -outdated graphics -disappointing story  Avoid this game if you have already watched Twin Peaks because it's basically the same thing but in a video game form. 
3454	Well, I've got to say that this game has a terrific intro where grandpa goes for a walk with his two grandkids through somewhere he knows isn't safe. He's right because dp.exe has stopped working. My 50 minutes of play reflects how much I enjoyed this game though for the money, I wouldn't have minded finding out what happens after they discover the cut up lady in the tree. I tried several claimed fixes including the PhysX upgrade through nVidia GeForce Experience panel (which is a later version than what was supplied with this game so prevents further attemps of the so-called 'repair' fix that didn't change the crash experience for me, anyway). Nothing seemed to help. It's not as though my system is so old or incompatible (ASUS i7 notebook with 8GB RAM &amp; GeForece 610M with 2GB RAM running Win7)
3455	As much as I want to recommend this game, I really don't think it's worth buying.  Many other reviewers give this a thumbs up because of the game itself, which is indeed fun and unique. But this port is so awful it's definatly not worth the money. It's crashing more consistently than any other game I've played. Playing it is an excercise in stubborness, and every time you do ANYTHING your first thought is run to a save point before it crashes and I have to repeat that again.  It doesn't matter how good the game is if it's unplayble. Do not buy this unless the devs fix this terrible PC port. If it gets patched then definatly get it. Not before.
3456	Don't waste your money on this port. No matter what I did to try to get this game to work and not crash, didn't work. I really, really want to play it. I can't say it's impossible, since some people are able to enjoy it, but I can't and it makes me sad. Time to hunt down a copy for PS3.
3457	Fantastic story and characters with great music. Gameplay is completely busted at moments. I'd suggest watching a playthrough like the one from Video Games Awesome or Giant Bomb instead of actually playing the game. It's really not worth the hassle to slog through the gameplay.  I groaned everytime there was an action sequence (I counted around 6). The combat isn't really enjoyable, sometimes you needed to fight monsters before you could progress, sometimes they infinitely respawn. The levels could become mazelike and hard to navigate through. At some point you need to do a tailgating mission that takes way too long (5-10 minutes). The bossfights aren't enjoyable because of the combat. The map layout of the town is made by a madman. You will sometimes need to drive to the other end of the town and instead of having a straight line from point A to B, you have a gigantic swerving line (not exaggerated). At some point there is a new mob introduced that's very bulletspongy but you can easily take out with melee. The downside? Your melee grade degrade so fast it's not even funny. There is a sequence where you need to fight four of those monsters in a row and I pretty much ran out of usable weapons at that time. When your health is low, you'll start limping, have fun progressing through the levels like that!
3458	Can't even launch the game.What a piece of junk 0/10
3459	thank God i have the ps3 version, this one sucks!
3460	Horrible game *.* 
3461	This port sucks. â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ that I have to pay for a second copy of the game on PS3 to actually be able to play it.
3462	This game is a scam If you have NVIDIA card you will play with 12 FPS due to a memory leak No solution for this .Be warned
3463	Hey now, don't be confused by all the hype you've heard. This game plays poorly, really poorly. It's unstable and has poor FPS. Mechanically, it's a mess. It took me almost an hour jiggering around with mods and what-not to get it working. Controller support is rubbish and keyboard is almost as bad (somehow more tolerable).  The story itself is hilariously goofy and weird and has often been compared to Twin Peaks. I highly suggest just watching a playthrough of the game, make someone else play this for you. You don't have to pay for it and you don't have to deal with its horrid controls and performance.
3464	Worst pc port ever created.STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THIS GAME EVEN IF TI COSTS 0.1$.I have and nvidia gtx 560 ti 2gb video memory, 8gb ram and an intel core i5.I can barely hit 10 fps.Realy check the community hub.DONT BUY ! DONT BUY!DONT BUY!.  FINAL VERDICT: 0/10 BECAUSE I COULDNT EVE PLAY IT.
3465	I started playing this and it crashed right away.  I followed the PhysX reinstall option (google search it) and it started working.  Found the game can only be played at 720p, forced resolution, no way around that using the vanilla game software.  Tried DPFix to change that. All ini file parameters were WELL within what my PC and vidcard can handle, which, for this game isn't a heck of a lot. Tried to play... game crashed right away.  Did the PhysX reinstall again. Tried to play... game crashed right away.  Decided I'd already used up $2.49 worth of my time and uninstalled this piece of crap game.
3466	Bought the game, it crashed on every start up.  Read the support pages, didn't help. Visited company's website (both Steam and the developer's): no help. Downloaded every mod and patch to fix it: none worked.  They should rename the game: 'System Restore, the reboot joyride!'  Please steam, don't get your customers steamed up. Just give me a refund or store credit and I'll try a different one.
3467	I would love to say that this game is giving you the whole game worth that silen hill delivered.  However, for that to be true, i would need to actually be able to play it. This review is getting a thumps down, based on the fact that it doesn't work, and you cannot even get it to the game.  I had to leave it for 5 minutes in a windows saying that the exe had crashed, in order to write this.
3468	This game is unplayable, there are constant crashes.
3469	I spent three hours trying to get this to work and played through the intro, then went to play some more and it wouldn't work anymore. I just bought the PS3 version instead. Don't buy this.
3470	i whant my money back the game is bugd and and i cant play it i reinstalt it 5 times i done 100 difrent stuff to it and dont whant to work so is the suporters of the game see the massage. I WANT MY MONEY BACK !!!!!!
3471	Wow this is why i should read comments this was not expected, stay away from this game it just likes to crash....alot.
3472	This is a review based on the port of the game and not the actual gameplay. I can't recommend this game because of the bugs that plague it. It is rendered unplayable because I can't even read any of the text.
3473	This game is a scam If you have NVIDIA card you will play with 12 FPS due to a memory leak No solution for this .Be warned

3478	It takes more to try to fix and work around all the different crashes and bugs this game has than actually finishing it. If you're looking for the worst PC port ever made, here it is.
3479	I spent three hours trying to get this to work and played through the intro, then went to play some more and it wouldn't work anymore. I just bought the PS3 version instead. Don't buy this.
3480	I tried to like this, it's just the right kinda weird to be interestging, but it is a bug riddled mess, and one of the worst PC ports I've seen in a while. Add to that all the unnecessary QTEs and rather annoying boss fights, and I just can't recommend it unless you're seriously out for an all around punishing experience.
3481	WonÂ´t run at all-a complete waste of time.No tips from the internet can solve this, this 'conversion' seems to have be programmed by badly trained cockroaches. What will the 'publisher' do next? Steal childrenÂ´s lollipops? Shame on you, may your disgraceful coding hand rot away! 
3482	This game is amazing! It's almost like they took Patrick Bateman from American Psycho, and cast him individually as an FBI agent investigating a small town murder with a Silent Hill twist.  Unfortunately, you have to jump through hoops to get the game working, and god forbid you have 5.1 surround sound!  Unfortunately, going through the process of fixing the game, the game is still incredibly bugged, and is borderline unplayable. If this game functioned, I would give it a 9/10 (some gameplay elements are laughable). However, the sad reality is that you may end up wasting your money buying this game, especially if you are not persistent and willing to play through the many crashes that truly break the game's immersion.
3483	Startup crash because game installs bugged physx? Ok, fixed it. Console resolution? Fine, fixed. Broken 5.1 sound? Oh well, it runs fine in stereo. Unavoidable crash in chapter 2?.. â¥â¥â¥â¥ it. I tried everyting. I really hate this game, instead of enjoing it, and fighting in-game monsters, I had to fight the game itself. Curse upon you, who ported it on a PC!
3484	Really bad PC port. Can't even get past the opening video sequence in the beginning of the game without a crash. 'Dp.exe has encountered a problem' and then crash to desktop.  This happens with DPfix AND without DPfix.  You may have better luck than me, but just to be safe, don't buy this game on Steam unless it's incredibly discounted in a sale. That way you won't lose much if it doesn't end up working.  It's a shame I wasn't able to get this working because it looks like a neat game otherwise. Just can't recommend such a sloppy port.
3485	I loved the game, however it keeps crashing after hospital level no matter what I do.  I tried various fixes from all around the net, no use.  If you can get this game on a console OR you are confident it will work, you should definetly buy it, because it's a hidden gem.  HOWEVER, if you are unsure whether to buy it or not, don't risk.
3486	I really would like to finish playing this game but it keeps crashing on one of the loading screens in chapter 3. I have tried a lot of the suggested solutions like: uncheck full screen, run in compatibility mode, run as administrator ... - Like it should never be this hard to get a game to work. What a pity. 
3487	No clue about the content of the game -- after installing (and restarting PC) it is unplayably laggy. Which I would have read the review section first, my own fault.

3490	thank God i have the ps3 version, this one sucks!
3491	10/10 would crash again!  **********BUYER BEWARE**********  This game won't even start for me.
3492	terrible port. not worth the hard drive space
3493	Tried this game out after reading a few of the positive reviews even though they mentioned the game was buggy and the controls could be quite awkward, but that the main story made up for it.

You don't have to pay for it and you don't have to deal with its horrid controls and performance.
3497	Gave up trying to get it to work.
3498	I love this game. I well and truly love it, it's a beautiful train wreck of a game where you either love it or utterly despise it. I seem to have fallen in love with it from the first time i played it back on my 360, then to the second time on PS3, now looking to do the hat trick by fully completing it once again on PC!  But For the love of GOD as much as i want to i can't! As much as i want to play my favourite game i can't due to the simply shocking port of it on PC. Constantly crashing, unreliable at almost every turn, and most recently when i hit act 1 Chapter 6 and saved outside the Greenvale Community Centre, my save file will not load at all. It shows the loading screen then tabs me out the game saying 'Dp.exe has stopped responding'  So i warn you all now, fans of this game it is fantastic and the thought of playing it once again is exciting. But it's an utterly appaling port. Hence why it saddens me to downreview this just for that.
3499	When you've been playing the game for about 10 minutes and you're glad it hasn't crashed yet - that's not a good sign. I've played this game for about 4 hours, and I've spent another 4 hours to try to get this game to work. When I finally did get the game to run better (that is not crashing every 10 minutes but every 20 minutes instead), my save file became corrupted and I can't advance in the storyline. And I'm not the only one with these problems.   It's a shame though, because the game itself is really really really good. The game hasn't been updated for years, so don't expect it to become any better.  Do not buy this game at any price. Do not even accept it for free. If you're really interested in this game you're better off buying the Xbox 360 version or watching a let's play on Youtube. Because this is one of the worst PC ports on Steam.   
3500	Probably one of the worst PC ports on Steam.  If you get this game to run, pat yourself and drink a beer.
3501	Can't launch the game. Crashes every time after opening cinematic. Tried everything I can find.
3502	This game is unplayable, there are constant crashes.
3503	Great plot but unplayable most times because a terrible PC port. Also gameplay is a pain in the â¥â¥â¥ when it comes to aiming and shooting people, clearly Swery has no taste in real shooting or action games.
3504	It's an incredible game, it's simultaneously terrible and amazing (beyond 'so bad it's good', you're going to have to take my word for it) making for one of the most unique, confusing, hilarious, and quotable gaming experiences ever to grace the face of the universe.  So why not recommended, you might ask? The port. Japan is notorious for their terrible PC ports, but this one reaches an all time low, it really is that bad. If you pick this up prepare to be greeted with such lovely features such as:  720p resolution lock (Can be fixed by DPFix)   15fps, but only half the time you start the game. Also note it's still running at 60 (evident by some of the camera movement and the pause menu, but the timing is messed up for everything else).   Bad controller support. This game was originally a XBox 360 game, which makes the dev's choice of DirectInput over XInput make even less sense. Editing controller binding happens in the launcher and is extremely limited &amp; finicky (DPFix does give you a few more options through ini files).   Random crashes, the game tends to crash randomly due to memory leaks or just bugs in the game code. There's some ways to lessen the effect but no way to get rid of all of them.   Not so random crashes, some parts of the the game just outright crash and you have to do all sorts of stuff to try to work around them (such as running in compatibility mode for Win98, or rebooting your PC), but even that's not as bad as   Save file corruption, save files can easily become corrupted, causing the game to crash soon after load, and usually in the same spots. Sometimes the only work around is to delete your save and start again. Save often and backup saves often.   It's a great game but it's just not worth the money they're asking for considering the state of the port, however if it goes really cheap it might be worth the gamble if you can make the port bearable. If you are a XB360 or PS3 owner then I highly recommended you pick it up for one of those if you can find it cheap (might need to import the PS3 version however). If you just want your dose of SWERY then I suggest you go and pick up D4: Dark Dreams Don't Die, which is cheaper and has a good PC port (Unreal Engine 3). 
3505	I'd recommend you try and track down a copy of this just to experience it. Just not the PC port. It just started crashing on me and, from what I've heard, it's going to be downhill from here. Find a copy on the 360 or PS3/4 instead.
3506	This game has wierd amusing moments, intriging story, some puzzles I ran into were kind of interesting and there were alot of strange side activites that I found. I understand why this game was a cult hit. HOWEVER, the pc port of this game is terrible. Locked resolution that cant be changed unless you get the fix developed by someone outside the company that made this game (Which by the way, may or may not work for some people.... which it didnt work for me unless I used windowed mode LAME). Without the fix this game looks like garbage and what I would expect from a playstation 1 game. Awful controls, hit or miss voice acting (which wasnt that big a deal for me), terrible combat system, AND GAME CRASHES are also present in the game. If the developer actually took the time to fix some of these things in the directors cut and properly ported it to the pc, this may have been a fun experince. But since the game controls bad and crashes often, not to metion the resolution debacle, I would recommend you get the console version of this game or watch lets play on youtube or whatever
3507	I bought this on sale for $5. I couldnt even imagine spending more.  The game is riddled with bugs and frequent crashes and the controls feel clunky and uncomfortable.   The gameplay isnt really that good but the story and music are interesting and are just enough to justify buying it on sale. I can understand the almost seemlingly visual manifestation of something like Macintosh Plus (music) mixed in with heavy influences of Twin Peaks. The music is strange and it makes the whole experience and vibe strange, in a good way.   Unless you like bizarre experimental type games that does not take it self seriously and/or a big fan of Twin Peaks or anything like that then I would skip this unless you can get it for $5 or less.
3508	game crashes within the first 5 minutes every time.
3509	Looks great but ultimately unplayable for me.
3510	bad game in history
3511	WonÂ´t run at all-a complete waste of time.No tips from the internet can solve this, this 'conversion' seems to have be programmed by badly trained cockroaches. What will the 'publisher' do next? Steal childrenÂ´s lollipops? Shame on you, may your disgraceful coding hand rot away! 
3512	It's been already a few months since I bought this game but I still can't play this game because whenever I tried to start this game, there was always an error occurred. Anyone who can help me with this problem? Please give me the damn fuc*ing patches!!!
3513	I tried to like this, it's just the right kinda weird to be interestging, but it is a bug riddled mess, and one of the worst PC ports I've seen in a while. Add to that all the unnecessary QTEs and rather annoying boss fights, and I just can't recommend it unless you're seriously out for an all around punishing experience.
3514	This game port is absolute trash. It won't even start....geez!!! I see there are some fixes for it but why am I going to go through all that trouble?!?! I waste money it's all I can say!!!! Ok after messing with it I finally got it to load up, but still I shouldn't have to do that much stuff to get it running.
3515	Deadly Premonition. What can I say? This game is known for being a Twin Peaks-esque cult classic that is easy to overlook as being horrible in every way, yet somehow pulling it all together perfectly.  Unfortunately, it's also notorious on the forums as being nigh unplayable by most people. I unfortunately am faced with the problem. Even after running a mandatory fix for the game, that only got me as far as the mandatory unskippable 5 minute opening cut-scene. Only after this part is over does my game crash every time. After trying a few different methods of fixing it, I concluded that this game is completely broken and not worth the time.  This is a game that I wanted to fall in love with and recommend to all, but I just can't in good conscience do. If you're absolutely determined to play this game, then by all means purchase it for 90% off, but DON'T pay the full amount, and DON'T expect this game to work for you.
3516	I wasn't even able to play the game, the support is awfull, and the online help useless. I let the game run for 5 minutes just to warn you about this abomination. Dont buy it!!!  This is an update in my review. After some time I managed to solve the crash on start problem. The game is useful, just a pretentious game, with graphics from ps2. Is not a survival horror game in any way. You have infinities bullets, the enemies are really easy to kill, and not scary at all. The story is a little interesting but just for a couple of minutes, before it's pretentiousness kill all the mood. Above all it has a quick time event mechanics in the encounters with the main monster.  Do not buy it!!
3517	dont bother Im serious
3518	Sadly, I couldnt get this to work, shouldn't be sold on steam.
3519	I LOVE THE GAME, I HATE NOT BEING ABLE TO PLAY IT...
3520	Unplayable on Win 10. â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ of bugs keeps me from completing Ch 1.
3521	Gave up trying to get it to work.
3522	Crash on start.
3523	I really want to say yes to this game. Great music, Great story and just like twin peaks. To bad that they sell you the game broken and you need to go into the game files to fix it. Then you need a fan patch to get a playable frame rate and hope it dons't keep crashing on you.   Everybody has this problem. I did my time trying to get this game to run but it refuses to co-operate. Can get maybe an hour or two in before another problem pops up.
3524	Horrible port, after I got past the crashing cutscene of the hospital in chapter one I just get crashes on every single cutscene after that, screw this mess, I was thinking of actually playing this game but â¥â¥â¥â¥ it. Fix your â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game Rising Star. I'll just keep the game open for the cards. This was barely worth the Â£1 I paid for it.
3525	When you've been playing the game for about 10 minutes and you're glad it hasn't crashed yet - that's not a good sign. I've played this game for about 4 hours, and I've spent another 4 hours to try to get this game to work. When I finally did get the game to run better (that is not crashing every 10 minutes but every 20 minutes instead), my save file became corrupted and I can't advance in the storyline. And I'm not the only one with these problems.   It's a shame though, because the game itself is really really really good. The game hasn't been updated for years, so don't expect it to become any better.  Do not buy this game at any price. Do not even accept it for free. If you're really interested in this game you're better off buying the Xbox 360 version or watching a let's play on Youtube. Because this is one of the worst PC ports on Steam.   
3526	It is a great game, the story is great, the characters and the soundtrack are amazing. But it doesn't work properly. I spent two hours fix the dp.exe doesn't work problem. It crashes multiple times I have to repeat tedious activities like driving, the controls are complicated (press space, focus with right mouse than shoot with left) I always f**** up the quicktime events, because there too fast. no I am stuck at the diner and nobody can help me to fix my problem.  if you are in the same situation like me and you have no playstation or xbox...watch a Let's play or ask a friend if you can play it on her/his console but don't buy this game, really it will spare you a lot of frustration.
3527	Awesome game, unfortunatly UMPLAYABLE, awful port, constant freezes. Just wasted about 3 hours trying to fix it and it won. Won't be fixed, and I won't finish it. Money down the drain.
3528	It's not the worst case, not the worst game, but it makes you question yourself - but why?! Also controls kinda sucks.
3529	This game does not work for me. I was excited to play it and its never going to run properly on my computer. Disappointed. I can't really recommend/not recommend this game because I haven't played it. Just a word of warning though, if your computer struggles with SOME games (not necessarily all, I can play a lot of games on my laptop considering its not a gaming laptop per se) like mine does, it won't be able to run this. I wish I didn't waste my money.
3530	I Like Games that are Ported to PC. I would Probably like it more if it actually worked. I would recommend this game but I would not recomend the port which came out kind-a clunky but for a game like this with already clunky mechanics it becomes too much.
3531	one of the worst games ive ever played: 1. graphics ps 2 tier at best 2. sound/music nonexistant/abysmal (except title theme which is reused like 50times in the game) 3.gameplay - barely a game, movement is clunky as â¥â¥â¥â¥, aiming is â¥â¥â¥â¥, enemies ar â¥â¥â¥â¥, qte's out the â¥â¥â¥, its â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥ 4. the port is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing abysmal, dark souls tier 5. oh and the story and characters - â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
3532	I love this game, but this is a ridiculously horrible port for PC. Crashes render the game unplayable and there are no simple, or heck, even hard fixes that deal with the issues. Unskippable Intros and Cutscenes make crashes even further infuriating. I could not use a controller due to the buttons defaulting to unusual key bindings and not all of the buttons can be altered. The start button was on the Right Trigger. I doubt we'll see patches that deal with these problems as well. I recommend buying it on a console, or watching someone on the internet play it for you, and save yourself the annoyance.
3533	I love this game. I well and truly love it, it's a beautiful train wreck of a game where you either love it or utterly despise it. I seem to have fallen in love with it from the first time i played it back on my 360, then to the second time on PS3, now looking to do the hat trick by fully completing it once again on PC!  But For the love of GOD as much as i want to i can't! As much as i want to play my favourite game i can't due to the simply shocking port of it on PC. Constantly crashing, unreliable at almost every turn, and most recently when i hit act 1 Chapter 6 and saved outside the Greenvale Community Centre, my save file will not load at all. It shows the loading screen then tabs me out the game saying 'Dp.exe has stopped responding'  So i warn you all now, fans of this game it is fantastic and the thought of playing it once again is exciting. But it's an utterly appaling port. Hence why it saddens me to downreview this just for that.
3534	Unplayable on my computer when trying to load a savegame. The content looked promising (being a Twin Peaks fan) but this port does a disservice to the brand.
3535	I can't get this game to function and there are entire forums full of people with problems getting the game to start and recomending mods that will trick the game into working. Why has there not been a patch to this game to make it playable without having to install mods?
3536	Might be one of the greatest games ever made... I wouldnt know however because despite jumping through all kinds of hoops to actually get this thing to even run, it crashed after 15 minutes. I didnt even try to restart it. Waste of effort / money.
3537	I spent more time trying to get DP to run than playing it, and what I did get to play was a mixed bag. In particular, the music, writing, and atmosphere are pretty good, insomuch as they are Twin Peaks: the game but the shooting segments are absolute garbage most of the town, and most of the spaces within the buildings in town are empty space and the cars turn like bricks
3538	Its not the worst game on steam and makes for a good story.. but the graphics and gameplay are absymal especially the PC mouse and keyboard controls.  The guidance system and world map are trash I wish there were mods to fix this.  The worst part of the game for me is the driving element. THe map is huge but there isnt anything worthwhile to see or do on it, the sleep and eating mandate as well as waiting around for the right time to start your investigation are nothing but tedium.  Most wont be able to get past the fact that the game has visuals from 2006 at best.
3539	This is a fun, quirky, game that unfortunately got a miserable PC port. When I start it up, I'm greeted by a black screen - I can hear the intro playing but I can't see anything. Through trial and error, I discovered that it was due to having my gamepad connected. Unplugging my gamepad allows me to play the game but I'm stuck with keyboard controls in a game that was clearly designed for controllers.  You have to download a fan-made patch to raise the resolution beyond 720p and there's just a whole host of other technical problems. Play this one on a console if you can.
3540	The game itself is great! Aside from the weird control layout, and sluggish aiming, which is fine. Because the game is very generous in giving you time in battle.   However the reason I can't recommend it is the port. It crashes! A lot! I'm only a few hours in and I've had to replay entire sections 3x so far. There's also no hope of it being fixed. Get the 360/PS3 version. Avoid this on steam.
3541	DISCLAIMER: I recommend any version of this beautiful game other than the pc port.  Deadly Premonition might be the greatest game of all time. While this review shall be focusing on the abominable pc version, I'll say this about the game itself: the graphics might be terrible, the sound effects were probably pulled from a free sound website, and it doesn't make much sense storywise at several points. But if you believe that games are about being immersed in a truly unique world, if gaming is not about getting an arbitrary number of points but is about telling a story in an amazing way that makes you care for the characters you see, I'd highly recommend you get this game for PS3 or Xbox 360.  Now onto the pc port, it's garbage. The problems are so numerous I have to seperate them into multiple catagories.  Crashes: Crashed 4 times in about 3.5 hours...maybe I could get a fanmade fix, but it's NEVER the fans' job to make sure the game works.  Controls: Space bar is draw weapon and aim (You can only fire and reload if you are aiming) I got used to this, but my problem is, while you can rebind many of the controls, you can't rebind aim to something resonable (Such as right mouse button) Also, certain buttons on the controller won't work if you bind them, for instance, I wanted to put the lock on command to left trigger. After I bound it, it did not work. Same as when I tried to put shoot onto right trigger.  Framerate: First half hour runs at about 10-15 fps, it ran fine for about an hour, now runs at a steady 5 fps. Uninstalling and reinstalling did not work.  Driving controls: They work fine (If a bit wonky) with a keyboard. When you use a controller, the physics speeds up so the cars, which only go about 60 mps in the game, can easily hit 150 on the open road and it makes the steering hyper sensitive. I thought at first the car's physics might have been locked to the framerate on consoles, explaining why on pc the cars go faster, since the pc version has a higher framerate. But why does it only effect controller?  In conclusion, the pc port sucks it's certainly not worth the bucks buy the game on PS3 or xbox, It will truly, knock off your socks.  So says Mr. Stewart.  Thanks for reading my review! My friend and I also have a youtube channel called, 'CultGamerAlliance'. Check it out if you get a chance!
3542	This port is simply atrocious, constant crashing, locked at 720P, game breaking bugs. I'd rather play the xbox 360 version. Played for slightly too long to get a steam refund, luckily I got it for $3.
3543	I'm still unable to play this game on Windows 10.64 bit.  Could be the OS but i guess is caused by the PhysX version installed and AMD GPU.  Game dev/publisher should solve this problem.  
3544	Deadly Premonition sucks. Ultimately, it fails on all levels. The setup of the story is actually pretty good. It's obviously biting off Twin Peaks. A weirdo FBI agent is sent to investigate a murder with supernatural overtones in a small town filled with wacky characters. The obvious inspirations for the game play are Silent Hill and Resident Evil. There are parts where a location transforms into a twisted nightmare version of the place and its filled with monsters and the player has to make their way through the nightmare version of the location to find clues to help the investigation. So, the combat takes place really in the protagonists mind. The combat gets really repetitive and boring really quick. There's really just one type of enemy to fight for most of the game besides bosses. Later there's another type that's even more boring and repetitive to fight. Every location ends up being the same thing. To gather the necessary clues you gotta wade through a series of narrow corridors fighting the same boring enemies over and over again. The combat is really clunky too like a Resident Evil game. There is one interesting part of this, though. At some point the legendary supernatural killer of the story, The Raincoat Killer, will track you down and the screen splits so you can also see through the killers eyes and your own point of view simultaneously. You need to hide from him for a certain amount of time before he gives up and goes away. Usually, right after this section there will be a chase sequence that's kind of like an on-rails quick time event where you need to escape from The Raincoat Killer. These encounters were fun the first few times, but even these interesting parts get repetitive as they are used over and over again. So, the actual combat portion of this game is a big dud. There's also a lot of driving that needs to be done in this game. It is also no fun. The cars handle terribly and they can even run out of gas. This is supposed to be an open-world exploration adventure game, but the fuel tank keeps a leash on you so its an annoying concern that made me not want to even bother with exploring the environment. Really, all there is anyway is some random collectibles to find littered around and also some side quests. So, the driving portion is also not any fun. The PC version is a really bad port too. It crashes ALL the time. I lost several hours to stupid crashes that can and will strike at any time. There was even one cut scene that would guaranteed crash the game. I had to change the compatibility mode and some other options to get past this stupid bug. The game is originally capped at 30 fps and 720p. Ridiculous! The same guy that fixed this outrage for Dark Souls did a fix for Deadly Premonition too, but like the DS one, it seems like it just plain wears off after a while and the game reverts back to â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ graphics and frame rate. I had to re-start the final boss because the game was running so horribly it wouldn't even register inputs from the controller. One thing I did find at least amusing is that if you don't have your clothes cleaned every so often, flies will start buzzing around your character because of your stinky clothes. I got a chuckle of watching cut scenes where these big fat (white?) flies were swarming around this guy. Now to the story. The setup is intriguing. There's a serial killer on the loose which brings the FBI to the small town and while there, more people get murdered. I was hooked on the setup. However, once the story starts to explain what's going on and who is behind everything the story just falls completely apart. It's just plain â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. It's like a ten year old's idea of a murder mystery. It's unbelievably bad. It's so dumb! I'm shocked and baffled that this story isn't completely ripped apart by everyone that has reviewed this absurd game. This game is also not scary, AT ALL. It fails in that department too. On the technical, atmosphere, narrative, and game play levels this game fails across the board and I definitely recommend you avoid this game.
3545	Game crashes. Don't really want to sit through the tedious Nick/Diane mission just to have it crash again.
3546	Broken port and doesn't work, wouldn't recommend buying this.
3547	Fromw hat little I played, I loved this game. The charecters and the story are promising and reminiscent to the likes of twin peaks, the gameplay, while clunky seems to work within this context, the graphics and sound are not great but again, they seem to blend well with this game.  My issue witht he game however is that, as much as I want to enjoy and complete this game, the constant game crashes, bugs, freezes and sound glitches have tested and brought my willpower to the brink. I am sad to say that I have finally given in, I haven't even finished chapter 1 yet just because of how unbearable it has become. I've tried the durante patch, I have changed my sound from 5.1 to stereo to fix sound issues yet the random crashes still occur, at times making me lose quiet a bit of progression.   In short, I really love and do wanted to complete this game, but the constant crashes have prevented me from doing so.
3548	As an open world detective game my thought is, what's not to like? There's going to be a murder to solve, you're free to roam and take on side missions, and there's something creepy and supernatural going on. Unfortunately, this is the definition of a bad port, and probably shouldnt be on steam at all. The game just isn't stable, and it looks horrible. The controls also leave a lot to be desired, at least if you're using a controller. Fortunately, the community of gamers have done a lot to support the game and fix what they can. My version looks a whole lot better, and is a bit more stable as a result. My confusion however, is why steam, and the original developer would want to be affiliated with all these known problems with no attempt to correct for it.
3549	It is difficult to discern if this game is brilliantly bizarre or bizzarely brilliant. One thing is certain is that this game is not worth full price. There are no options to adjust the graphics; and the graphics suggest that is game has been poorly ported or created.   The controls are fine, but employ tank controls for shooting. That is to say, movement is not allowed whilst aiming. The game does not have the horror vibe that the tags indicate.   One last thing to note is the amount of loading screens and unnecessary sequences. If you pause the game you get an unnecessary sequence of bushes moving aside. Or when you pick up an item, it presents a slowly rotating image of the item.   For buyers considering the game, wait for sale.
3550	This isn't a full review since I haven't finished the game yet. This is just my current impressions thus far.  This port is terrible. Even with DPfix installed it's still pretty bad. Controls are clunky &amp; driving is nearly impossible with a joystick. I have to swap movement with the D-Pad &amp; lightly press it for turns because it's so sensitive. I don't know if I'll ever really finish this game because of the terrible controls.
3551	It's not the worst case, not the worst game, but it makes you question yourself - but why?! Also controls kinda sucks.
3552	Game crashes. Don't really want to sit through the tedious Nick/Diane mission just to have it crash again.
3553	Great game, probably one of the worst PC ports I've played. Why was this allowed to be sold to the public?
3554	Broken port and doesn't work, wouldn't recommend buying this.
3555	I simply couldn't get past the horrible combat system, terrible sound, wooden voice acting, and dated visuals. There might be a good story in there, but I doubt ill see it. Also, the game chugged terribly. Not recommended
3556	I'm still unable to play this game on Windows 10.64 bit.  Could be the OS but i guess is caused by the PhysX version installed and AMD GPU.  Game dev/publisher should solve this problem.  
3557	Horrible port, after I got past the crashing cutscene of the hospital in chapter one I just get crashes on every single cutscene after that, screw this mess, I was thinking of actually playing this game but â¥â¥â¥â¥ it. Fix your â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game Rising Star. I'll just keep the game open for the cards. This was barely worth the Â£1 I paid for it.
3558	When you've been playing the game for about 10 minutes and you're glad it hasn't crashed yet - that's not a good sign. I've played this game for about 4 hours, and I've spent another 4 hours to try to get this game to work.

3560	This game is a good game, but it has a lot of crash issues and freeze's, i cant continue to play this game because of the problems i even tried fixing the problem but nothing works, but i did not try everything. Overall i think its just broken so im going to buy it for 360 to beat it instead. Maybe one day they will fix it on here i hope so.

3562	I wish Steam would allow for more than a 'Recommend' or 'don't recommend' option, since I can see both sides of such an argument. Before I begin, just on this review. I have played this game for more than the clocked 9 hours, but apparently Steam does not register this during offline-mode. I 100%'ed the game in about 20-25 hours.  Deadly Premonition is great and terrible at the same time. The story is fantastic, the characters are memorable, the sidequests are almost all gems and when you're in the zone this game becomes rather addictive. On the other hand, the PC version of this game is riddled with bugs. Terrible, game-crashing bugs. If you look online you'll find some fixes, but even after following everything recommended, the game will still crash after about three hours of playing. The problem lies in the memory management. if you unlock the game to use the maximum amount of RAM it takes longer for the game to crash. The way to play with the least amount of frustration is to restart your PC the moment the game starts lagging. Had I not already owned the game before learning of this, I might have passed it over, but even with getting thrown out of the game two to three times per playing session, I still loved it. The graphics are not bad and neither is the sound. the controls are rather intuitive and combat is fairly smooth.  I you're up for a great story and don't mind playing in shorter segments and saving an awful lot, this game is for you. On the other hand, if you get frustrated replaying parts because the dreadful 'DP.exe has stopped working' appears, I'd recommend you go for the PS3 or XBOX versions.
3563	This is a fun, quirky, game that unfortunately got a miserable PC port. When I start it up, I'm greeted by a black screen - I can hear the intro playing but I can't see anything. Through trial and error, I discovered that it was due to having my gamepad connected. Unplugging my gamepad allows me to play the game but I'm stuck with keyboard controls in a game that was clearly designed for controllers.  You have to download a fan-made patch to raise the resolution beyond 720p and there's just a whole host of other technical problems. Play this one on a console if you can.
3564	Such an awesome game, it's a shame that it has so many bugs in this PC port. Some unofficial patches may turn it more playable, but the constant crashes and issues makes me not recommend this game.
3565	Game itself is great, this port is horrible. Those interested should play the original version on the Xbox 360 - it has better, warmer colours and more fitting textures. Directors cut version also adds few things to the game that make it worse than the original.   This PC port (- even with the DPfix) is filled with crashes, strange framerate issues and other technical woes. Beating the final boss is almost impossible due to the aiming bug that persists trough out the whole game (some might have luck with messing win98 compatibility modes or alt-tabing â I didnât).  That said, I enjoyed it but find really hard to recommend this version of the game to any one.
3566	I've been a big fan of platformers since my family got a NES in the late 80s. I've played a sizeable number of them since, but the ones that made the biggest impression on me were the ones where it's not all about the platforming, but really exploring the game and trying to figure out every single secret hidden in it. And secrets have become such a de facto standard of the mainstream 2D platformers to the point where the secrets and locations of them have become rather formulaic. The wonder of finding them has all but disappeared.  That's one of the reasons I love Knytt Underground so much. The fact that the world is so huge makes just getting around it a great endeavour in itself, but there's also so much stuff hidden under the surface if you care to dig into it. And it's mostly not about finding an equivalent to a star coin or a 1-Up, but rather about getting intimate with a game world that's so carefully and lovingly crafted. It's about talking to an NPC that isn't a step towards beating the game, but piecing together another part of the lore of the people of the underground. And it's about exploring amazing locations just for the sake of exploration; not because there's a carrot dangling at the end of your journey.  In short, this is probably my game of the year.
3567	I donât know about you, but I sure love it when the game tricks me into believing that itâs something else. Knytt Underground looks like a small and cute trifle with nothing but a cool photo-collage backgrounds paired with primitive art-style and rather abstract jokes. And it ends with explosions, quite literally. Well, at least the author inserts himself into the game to tell you this in person. First two short chapters (out of three, mind you) donât look like much. The player is introduced to the base mechanics, of which there aren't really a lot of: you can jump, climb any vertical wall, transform yourself into a big rubber ball (this particular one can be seen only in demo-level, which is included along first two chapters and has its complete separate level) and gain access to higher jumps. Occasionally you can collect a one-time-use-power-up which looks like glowing flower bud; and most of the time this âspecial abilityâ is nothing more than some fancy high jump or short free-fly-mode for getting where you couldnât just climb up, because the wall isnât completely even. So I was ready to write it off with I a notion âI certainly understand why itâs so highly praised on indie scene, butâ¦â. But then the third chapter happened. Forty minutes later, when I was realising in panic that I havenât seen even 10% of the map and found a single save point, I realised I got into the rabbit hole; what I didnât know is, that it would turn out to be a truly amazing adventure. The seem-to-be-obvious primary purpose of âjust following the storyâ is being crushed by the enormous world size. You donât really know the right path, thereâs a lot of obstacles and, finally, the path to the story points is blocked by some treasure-hungry NPCs; so you have to wander off. And thatâs where it becomes firstly mysterious, then great, and finally, near the end, obvious. You didnât come here to just play it through. Youâve come here as a discoverer of sorts. The one that boldly steps into the unknown and makes a map of the journey; all this quite literally: the world is divided into a familiar grid of separate screens and thereâs no telling what will you see in the next one for most of the time. The game also acknowledges this fact without a single doubt: formal purpose is what it is â formality, cause for an adventure. So what did I discover here? I found a whole surrealistic underground world inhabited by sprites and fairies, who barely remember the history of this world, but call themselves strange names, like âThe Internetâ. They remember though the catastrophic events of war waged by humans, that ended with the world being reduced to these scattered survivors, living in ruins, holding mystic beliefs and treating leftover household items from pre-war times as magical powerful artefacts. And yet these folks have enough in them to give you a good reason for watching them in natural habitat, exploring their lives and getting from them pieces of history. It will never, though, become clear what really happened. You didnât really expect that from a game, which literally is dedicated to uncertainty and meaning of seeming obscure final goal? Yep, thatâs it, fourth wall is a regular punchbag here. Aside from the cryptic story and chilling ambience of the scenery, thereâs more too. The gameplay makes a sudden skyrocketing, shifting from âmindless jumpingâ to âcarefully solving puzzles with jumpsâ; and not only with jumps. Rubber ball form now becomes useful not only for jumping higher, but for doing all kinds of tricks. Those simple power-ups now require planning before their usage. One wrong move â and at best youâll have to try again, sometimes dying from contact with molten lava or not-so-friendly-robot laser beam. And thatâs not worst that could happen, sometime youâll fail so bad, youâll fall to the other screen; getting back up isnât an easy task for most of the time. But with enough focus and thinking youâll get all those coins, and flowers, and keyboard keys, and maybe even some secret symbols. Even if you donât it wonât change much; a game that is filled with secrets wonât hide that much if you wonât find all of them. After all, that was the message of it. If the goal isnât clear, or doesnât really make sense, it will be the false one.
3568	A wonderful game full of mysteries and hidden paths. Really beautiful places, and a very nice story, atmosphere and music.  Destination isn't as important as the journey. â¥
3569	Knytt Underground follows the sprite Mi on a mission to ward off the apocalypse. At least, that's what she's doing if you listen to the angel on her shoulder; her shoulder devil is of another mind. It's also about life after us. The little buggers who built their civilization on whatever garbage we left behind seem to be doing just fine, impending doom notwithstanding. Vexing, but hardly surprising.  But, at its heart, what Knytt Underground is really about is an impossibly large map. Man, that thing is big. There's about 1,500 screens in the main world, and there is even a little extra hidden beyond the boundaries.  This is not quite a metroidvania -- your 'verbs' are limited to jumping, bouncing and the occasional single-use power-up used for the trickier platforming puzzles (firing one shot, double jump, limited flight ability). A lot of the Nifflas experience is going through vast areas with no real challenges, taking the scenery in. All the same, it's not just a stroll in the park: there are also tricky jumps, shortcuts and hidden passages galore. While your palette of actions is limited, the controls are tight enough that this is all doable on a keyboard.  The backgrounds in this game are pretty, even if they're mostly saturated pictures of nature. Character portraits are kind of goofy. As for the writing, it can be grating in an indie games kind of way, but it's just self-aware enough to land on the 'charmingly quirky' end of the spectrum.  But again, this is a game about a map. A huge map. It beckons. It's calling out to you. '... Heeeeey', it says. 'Do you like exploring?'  Well, do you?
3570	Puzzle platformers rarely get as good as this. The storytelling is lovely, the soundtrack is immersive and the art is beautiful. Only negative point goes for the lack of native controller support, although I've played it first on a playstation and find the pc+keyboard version to be much more responsive. Some puzzles are quite frustrating, but what's the fun otherwise? I've recommended this to every single person I love.
3571	 tl;dr: Knytt Underground is a 10/10, it's amazingly detailed and has so much charm that it's practically oozing out. Brilliant Sound design, fitting music, intelligent dialogue, addictive gameplay, and a massive world to explore that's handled expertedly.   I'm in love with this game, when I first got it I knew that I was going to love it. The sounds, the music, the backgrounds, the art, the gameplay, the characters, everything! It just feels so thought out like a giant complete puzzle. As such, I'll be going into detail about things that make this game great, and also replying to the most Popular Negative Reviews here on Steam.   Gameplay -- The most important thing in any game is of course how it plays. And Knytt Underground plays execellently. It's an entirely physics based platformer with neat power-ups that don't make you stronger, but instead allows you to navigate in different ways to get past obstacles. There's also a transformation that turns Mii Sprocket (The muted character you play as) to become a bouncey ball, where you can bounce up to high places. This transformation is entirely physics based, and it's damn accurate! It's very addictive.   Exploration -- Chapter 1 and 2 of the game are basically Introductions to the World, Tutorials, and the primary characters. Chapter 3 is where the training wheels are removed and you're allowed to freely explore an underground world of massive size with varying environments and hundreds, thousands of secrets to discover. There's even secrets in the main menu!   Themes -- Probably the second most important thing in games, at least in my opinion. Here in Knytt Underground you have some pretty serious themes that you have to stop and think about, they also reflect the Modern World in a way or too. Religion, Atheism, Emotional trauma and finding happiness in the little things play a major key in the story and even gameplay in the form of quests. 'Hey! You're that Sprocket Explorer kid, right? I don't suppose you could help me by going up into some dangerous caves to fetch me my dead Brother's skull? I need to complete his grave. He blew up, you see. In a nasty dangerous awful accident-- blah blah blah blah~' Dialogue is usually like that, except that you can reply, in an interesting way...   Artistic Themes -- The literal themes of the game are very pretty, sometimes dark, and othertimes just bizarre. There's some characters who look like a Child drew them, othertimes there's characters who look batshote crazy, but each is charming in their own way. I love how there's basically zero limitations to the amount of characters you'll find. A weird monkey creature and can speak fluent English? Yup. A 6-inch high Ninja Warrior who wishes to kill you? Yup. A literal blob that's just chillin' around toxins? You bet'cha!  Dialogue -- There's hundreds of different and unique characters in Knytt with who you can interact with and even alter their futures, past sometimes as well! However, being the Mute Video-Game-Protagonist, you can't talk, you can certainly think, but never talk except for dreams. Instead you have to find two Fairies, a Moon Fairy called Cillia and a Sun Fairy called Dora. Their elements reflect their personalities. Cillia is dark, sarcastic, and down-to-earth, emotionally limited on the outside. Dora is the opposite, a bright optimist who's willing to give everyone a chance, but has a very dark past, and most likely a dark future. The dialogue for every character is usually really well written and is light-hearted at times, and dead-serious at other times. There's a secret where you find a Dead Body and you have to learn about the Dead Body's past, pretty grim stuff.   Interactivity -- To interact with this world's characters, you must send out two of your fairies; Cilia and Dora. Black and White. Moon and Sun. Negative and Positive. So you're limited between being Negative and Positive with your response, very black and white. There's no middle line, no silver lining, no inbetween that you can pick. Instead the characters of the world which you interact with are the Grey between these two choices. There's no perfect person in the world of Knytt Underground, they are realistic with the fact that they have problems and personality traits unique to them. So it's up to you to decide how to deal with them. Your choice will affect other outcomes and Cilia and Dora themselves. Pick Dora too much and Cilia will feel like she's a third-wheel. Pick Cilia too much, and Dora won't think that you're too good of a person. Not even Cilia and Dora are perfect at what they represent, Dora can be mean, while Cilia can sometimes be nice. Very realistic and solid.   Sound Design and Design in general -- I'll start off with Design in general. There's no Main Menu, instead you play through the menu and enter different path ways, it can take up a little too much time, but it's very pretty to look at and is always a good way to prepare you for your saved game. Sound Design is brilliant! It's super crisp quality that's authentc from the sounds of waterfalls, to mechanical robots, to the sounds of magical chimes.   Story -- I won't give away any spoilers, but you're an Explorer called Mi Sprocket of the Sprocket Family. You have been chosen to save the world by serving a Religion called Myriadism, where they believe in a God and have no respect for technology that was left over by Humans. Also forgot to mention that it's set after Humanity has killed itself, so the surface is a no-go, thus Knytt UNDERGROUND. Then there's the Internet, where they believe that the Human's technology is God-Like in design and activation, they value technology, but don't care too much about life of others. The Story is often interrupted and recapped to you by Nicklas, the developer and creator of the Knytt Series where he breaks the fourth-wall quite often. He's a really chill and cool guy in real life, and his personality and wall-breaking comments don't ruin the flow of the game.   Music -- The Musical Musicsky Musics of Knytt Underground are really relaxed and really fit well. There's a few songs which I dislike, but they did fit their environment. Some of the secret musical pieces are pretty repetitive since in their context they were just 10-second loops and entirely optional and don't impact the game in any big way.   Difficulty -- Chapter's 1 and 2 are very easy as they're tutorials. But some of the puzzles and platforming in Chapter 3 are really frocking tough, and sometimes will take at least an hour to nail down. But being such a large world, you can usually always skip through the platforming and puzzles via a secret path or completing certain quests.   Replayability -- I've never really heard of a replayable 2D Platformer before, except for maybe Mario Maker, but that's not really a game. But I've replayed Knytt Underground a few times now. A typical playthrough, focusing just on story takes roughly 5 hours. Filling up the map of each chapter, roughly 15 hours. 100 percenting that playthrough takes around 50 hours.   Modability and Community -- Since Knytt Underground is such an underrated and hidden gem in Steam, the community is small and inactive, likewise is the modding community. Infact, there's little to no mods, nothing major at least.   TIME TO RESPOND TO SOME OF THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS! --  'The silhouette style works, but hides a lot of the character and variety in the areas. The character sprites and portraits feel like programmer art' This is to avoid distracting the tight platforming.  -- Nitpicks -- I always go against Nitpicking, but for a masterpiece which is claimed by many or myself, I will point out issues. There's very little impactful nitpicks in Knytt, thankfully, but there is some. When you transform into the ball, you can sometimes bounce at the very top of slanted edges, but this can be dismissed as being on purpose. Realistically, the same thing would happen.
3572	The name of the game is secrets. Secrets Underground. That's what this is.  Nifflas, creator of the Knytt series, is a whimsical developer who just up and makes whatever he feels like making, usually a whimsical game about whimsical creatures going on whimsical adventures, and while Knytt Underground draws on that in its story and its visual and audio design, the characterization is a drastic change in tone. It handles serious and sensitive issues, and there's plenty of heavy language to go with that. Maybe it's the sheer unexpectedness of it that contributes to the M rating, whereas plenty of games with way more 'questionable content' keep their T rating because their general tone is darker. But that's not what the game is about. The game is about secrets. The game has way more secrets than achievements. There are often secrets within the secrets. Sometimes there are even secrets in THOSE secrets. How about a 4-layer secret? Don't put it past Nifflas; he'd do it. Nothing is too obscure. Very few players get the achievements in this game, and it's for a reason. Even if you find them all, you could still be missing a lot. Fact: Nifflas hates progress bars.  The Knytt series is a bit of a Metroid 'lite' with the emphasis on exploration and platforming challenges scattered throughout. Enemy encounters are infrequent, and they are not very aggressive, letting you take in the atmosphere even when they're around. Even more rarely will you actually have to confront the enemies, as most of the enemy-based challenges are about avoiding enemies or using them to your advantage. The biggest obstacles in the game are the NPCs, who are more than happy to make their living by setting up doors in the way of your goals and charging you in rare artifacts to open them. If you take this gameplay mechanic at face value, it can seem like the biggest gameplay element in Knytt Underground is a bunch of annoying fetch quests, but this is not necessarily true. Yes, if you've been staring at the map the whole time and heading straight toward your target destinations with no effort to explore on your own, you will be sent on fetch quests, but if you've been exploring adequately throughout your experience, very rarely will the NPCs actually succeed in making you turn around. The quests are also pretty lenient, as you don't have to find every item in the game to pay the tolls, and, in fact, you don't have to pay the tolls at all. If you're very skilled at navigating the world, you can find shortcuts around these annoying characters. The fetch quests aren't here to draw out the game length, they're there to offer a loosely guiding sense of purpose as you whimsically (there's that word again) explore the world and enjoy its atmosphere--just as how in Minecraft, the 'goal' of taking out the Ender Dragon is not the main appeal of the game, and if that were all you ever set out to do, you'd be missing the point. This isn't the kind of game you want to try and plow through quickly. If you do, you're seriously missing out, and probably not having a very good time.  The information in the above paragraph does not mean that Knytt Underground is braindead easy, however. There are plenty of hidden challenges that will test your platforming mettle, no matter what your background is. The key word here, though, is 'hidden.' They are far from mandatory to advance the story, and not necessary to complete in order to enjoy the game. They are there because Nifflas gets bored and makes them, and hides them in the game so there's something for everyone.
3573	Beautiful arts together with amazing soundtrack make this game an unique journey to the Knytt world. Huge amount of rooms to explore, secrets everywhere and many enjoyable challenges - this indie platformer has it all. The story keeps you immersed into mystery and 'gloomy' atmosphere. This game does not hold your hand all the time as you will need to figure out most of the things on your own (especially secrets, challenges).  Too bad this game does not have controller support but still it is not that bad to play it with keyboard. Despite few minor cons it is definitely worth to buy - If you like this type of games of course. It is not a typical and easy platform. You will spend more time here and enjoy the story with visual and audio effects.
3574	Knytt is a good platform, with lots to explore in wonderful colours and some puzzles that require skills, some of them so rogue and challenging to stress out asking for a break, but overall ends up being a joyful experience; soundtrack is appealing to the game as well.
3575	I think Knytt Underground is excellent.   A simple way to decide if you will like Knytt Underground is to go play Nifflas' other free games (available online). There is a lot of exploring and wandering about, and there a lot of unique-looking locations that make the large amounts of traveling worth it. The puzzles are stimulating and a few a quite tricky.   Chapters 1 &amp; 2 are a bit boring, but they are essentially tutorials (that can also be skipped).
3576	*I've finished this game on PSN.   This is one of the most underrated platformers.  I'm never a big platformer fan, even Mario and Rayman can't attract me much. But this one, you should never miss it.  Bad platformers give you tons of challenges and a tutorial that comes from nowhere, then they call it a 'game'. But in Knytt Underground, you put yourself in this eerie but beautiful world, granted with strange power and start your journey. Challenges in this game are not that difficult, but you still need to analyse and prepare your steps. If you fail the jump, you will immediately go back to a check-point in this small room, so the jumping is challenging but never annoying.   Control is easy and precise, but you may need some other software (like joy2key) to support your controller.  If you just want to read the main story, the game is not difficult and short. But there are much more things to explore. And you could find many interesting items, side-quests and more challenges. The story is well written, full of imagination. Dialogues are humorous so you never get bored.  The world, the atmosphere, the story and those challenges, all make this game so engaging. It's a wonderful experience, worth your time and money.
3577	Nice game. Atmosphere is cute and puzzles are unusual. There only one bad thing - dialogs. They are too long.
3578	Played the freeware game released by the dev some time ago and liked the game style. So buying this one was no real brainer. This version is entirely different compared to the freeware games. Much more polished look.   The game itself is '2D hardcore platform parkour goes Super Meat Boy' -type of endurance fest sometimes - sometimes it's quite a casual stroll around nice enviroments. No really, no saw blades here but the platforming challenges can sometimes be very punishing - and the game map is huge - enormous - way way large in Chapter 3 (first two are basicaly tutorials). Also lots of hidden tunnels and lots of weird characters.   Recommended to people who want a real platforming challenge.
3579	This is my first review on steam. I'll try to make it simple.  Knytt Underground is a platformer with puzzle mechanic. Most of the time these puzzles are simple. switch between 2 forms (human for climbing, and ball for bouncing) and use 'right one-use-power' at the right time to get to hard to reach places.   The thing is some solutions are not so simple and not very obvious on first sight so you might end up trying to go around some areas ... often leaving you in this 'what the fudge' state. That made me use a uncovered map i found on google :P. And made me revisit most of the areas and try to 're-reach' areas if there was some hidden passage. And belive me there are lots of them. But there are also areas only accessible if you uncover lore about characters. Just do every quest you find(or events marked as '?'), so dont get frustrated if you cant reach something now.  First two chapters are more of a tutorial short and simple. Real challange is chapter 3 wich is HUGE, map covers WHOLE SCREEN. played almost 20 hours of it to reach to the end (i started to use uncovered map after having about half of the map reveald and it had lots of uncovered holes).  There is this teleporting mechanic wich lets you teleport across the map but i havent use it ... cause i didnt know how so i ignored it.  In overal the game is challenging. ESPECIALLY if you plan to unlock all steam achevements. so if you are aiming for that i suggest reading steam community walkthroughs cause there is one achevement you get for 'not paying bell guards for entrence' wich i did unfortunately.   Other reviews state that dialogues are bad ... well maybe because this world is confusing, maybe that was the aim for the creators to make strange relations between races while engaging in some dificult topics about main characters. Depends on personal tastes . I didnt find them that bad. Some funny more or less. (there is even one adult joke but i wont spoil it :P)  Background pictures are amazing. Music is calm and pleasing. For adventurer LOTS of secrets to uncover.   In overall its a average game, good choice if you have nothing to play, Would be nice addicion for a mobile game.(there would be problem with implementing chapter 3 world map).  I 'kind of' liked it.  EDIT: This game seems complex but there is no wiki focused on this game unfortunately, wich would be usefull since there are lots of secrets, world lore, and interactions with NPCs in it.
3580	An unique, atmospheric platformer that begs to be explored  The controls feel responsive and smooth. The gameplay was entertaining and not overly difficult. The artwork is truly impressive because every room carries its own distinctive visual theme. The plot might not be the deepest but it still offers humorous and sometimes thought inducing insight into the world created. What makes it enjoyable for me is the exploration itself. Because each room is different, it had its own secrets to uncover and story to tell. Overall, an enjoyable game to play.
3581	Knytt Underground is a almost funny game about a girl that is about to visit some fairies. A solid design that invites you to explore the well told story. A nice sequel.   Review   Design :  The graphics in this game are extremely cleverly made. The highlighting of important things are a good guide through the game, while the real setting is rather introvert but very beautiful. The athmosphere of the game is keeping up the whole time from the very first until the last second of the game. Even though it kind of remings me of Braid, it is still it's own in a kinda way.  8/10    Music &amp; Audio :  While the audio is deeply integrated to the game, the music is kind of lost. Long phases without music playing in the background are taking the fun of the game, but when the music plays, it is very breathtaking and keeps up the morale.  8/10    Gameplay &amp; Addiction :  Besides that forced humor that is kind of annoying, the story of this game is told very great and is worth as much as the original Knytt. The gameplay is familiar and very clear, even though the level designs feel like labyrinths sometimes, but that's good. The long and sometime difficult levels are very fine and provide a lot of gamefun and playing hours.  7/10    Cost-Benefit Equation &amp; resumÃ© :  This is truely a great sequel to the platformer that will take your breath. A kind of funny told story that is worth it's money. The gaming duration is worth it, if you like to play interactive stories. Who cares about books? Play Knytt.  7/10    For the cheap price of 6.99â¬ (1.99â¬ in sale at the moment!) you get more than you can ask. Sell some of your useless DotA2/TF2/CS:GO stuff and buy this game.   Thank you! If you like this review, you can feel free to add me on Steam
3582	As a huge fan of Knytt Stories, I was looking forward to the release of this game. However, the result is not something which I can call worthwhile.  Graphics: Unfortunately, the transition to higher res graphics is not flattering at all. While Stories used simple sprites, the low res meant that this could pass for a purposeful aesthetic and it worked. Underground, by contrast, looks generally incoherent. The silhouette style works, but hides a lot of the character and variety in the areas. The character sprites and portraits feel like programmer art - they are impossible to take seriously.  Audio: The music and sound effects are consistently fitting, minimal and and atmospheric so a good job on this count.  Gameplay: The platforming mechanics here are fairly good, the level layouts are smart and there are a good number of save points along the way. The chaper two mechanics are pretty neat. However, progression through the game is not rewarding in the same way that a good Metroidvania should be. A lack of character upgrades and variety makes progression feel less like purposeful exploration and more like aimless stumbling around and backtracking. On a technical note, there is no controller support. The creator suggests using joy2key or xpadder but having tried this, it is clear that design choices in the keyboard conrtrols make this impractical.  Dialog: This is one of the more frustrating parts of the whole experience. It is clear that there was an attempt to be whimsical here but in reality, the dialog just serves to pull you right out of the game; creating a feeling that neither the characters or the writer are invested at all. Rather than being charming, it just kills the neat atmospheric mood that the game partway manages to establish.  Overall: Unfortunately, I can't recommend this game. Play Knytt Stories instead. It is free and feels much more complete and satisfying than Underground in every way. If you like Stories, then maybe consider buying this to support Nifflas almost as a donation for that game.
3583	A very large platformer filled with secrets. The checkpoint system is very forgiving, which is good since the platforming can be difficult.
3584	This is a good game if you're in the mood for exploration, and there is a lot of exploration. The big game mechanic here is that your character can switch between being a girl and being a ball at will. Yep, it sounds ridiculous, nobody in the story seems to care that this happens, but it's a fun mechanic. The girl can climb up walls, and the ball can jump high and gain some serious horizontal uncontrollable speed, which is fun, until you hit a ledge or something. You can climb to a high distance with the girl, then change to the ball and gain some extra jump height, or you can jump high with the ball and get to a climbing spot the girl couldn't get to before. Cool little mechanic with momentum.   Exploration is the main part of the game. There's little mini stories scattered all over for you to find. It's a big map, so there's quite a few of them. Fortunately, if they ask you to get something, it's usually nearby, so you don't have to take 30 minutes traveling across a 2d maze to get a McGuffin, just a few minutes at most. The world is a maze; nothing is straight forward. So have fun traveling as a ball one direction and ending up somewhere on the map you didn't expect.
3585	Fun gameplay with amazing characters. Totally worth it.
3586	Being the type of person who gets easily frustrated by 2d platformers, I really didn't want to play this initially, and to add to that, the goofy character designs didn't really encourage me, but gosh, I'm so glad I forced myself to give this game a chance, it's so cute and isn't particularly challenging, but has a lot to it in terms of depth. An ambience rich 2d platformer focused around artwork, Knytt Underground is just lovely. :]  I'd recommend playing it just before you go bed, with the lights dimmed, so you can just relax, and let the game draw you in!   Optimal enjoyment. ^w^  Do it. &gt;:C  Good doggy. :3
3587	This is a fun and relaxing game, with challenging puzzles. I love the atmosphere and the music. I also enjoyed 'Within a Deep Forest'.
3588	Interesting platformer with puzzle mechanics that includes using multiple abilities in conjunction with one another and has a metroid-vania final level that takes quite some time to fully explore. FYI most of the game is fine for kids except for a random f-bomb being dropped unnecessarily.
3589	A surprisingly good puzzle platform game. The world is huge with lots of secrets to explore. The controls are very fluid and I loved the secret challenge stages. It seemed like the game would be relatively short after the first 2 short stages but it opened up to a massive world to explore. Well worth the money I spent on it.
3590	Knytt Underground is easily one of the best indie games I've ever played. Perhaps one of the best, period. The world of Knytt is so brilliantly atmospheric and immersive.  I found myself more drawn into the world, the story and the characters in this game than in any other game I've ever played.  The platforming and puzzle elements are generally quite fun and challenging. Challenging, but never to the point that I lost my â¥â¥â¥â¥. This is partly due to the fact that I spent much of my time simply exploring it's brilliant world and talking to the interesting, amusing, and complex characters.  The art style is absolutely brilliant, and mostly consists of black sillhouette foregrounds, cartooney characters and backgrouns made of photos of various things like rocks and flowers, and such, pieced together in interesting ways.  The music is often times quite trippy and kind of melancholy, which really adds to the lonely atmosphere of the game. It's surprising that a game about sprites and fairies in a post-apocalyptic world, could have some of the most realistic, and deep characters of any game I've ever played. Bottom line, this is a game that has so much fun platforming, puzzle solving, exploration, atmosphere, and heart that...just buy it already! You won't regret it!
3591	16 hours this was a hella fun platformer with a lot of secrets and a cool plot, it can be easy to lose the save points in the last chapter through unfortunate exploration but persist you'll find one. Definitely worth the purchase cost.
3592	Aside of â¥â¥â¥â¥ poor controller support (which is no support at all, thanks to the Devs choosing wrong SDK), the game's pretty neat one. As it stands, the game does better with controller enabled, but since it's lacking support.. you can use workaround like Joy2Key to have controller support.   For the game itself, It's an exploration platformer, meaning you won't find many enemies to pawn like in Giana Sister or Mark of the Ninja. What you need is to move around, get past puzzle and do some tricks to advance. There are some annoying puzzles though that require you to be precise with the jump timing, or backtracking quite a bit when you fail. I guess it's part of the game.  The OST is a complete opposite of Electronic Super Joy with its hard punk - or whatever it's called - OST genre. The OST is pretty bland and unnoticed at times, well I don't think about it too much, the game's pretty slow paced as well.  All in all, a quite unique game. Recommended.
3593	Following in the footsteps of Nifflas' other memorable creations, Knytt Underground is a beautiful platformer you can play for literally hours and not get tired of. One thing I've always appreciated in Nifflas' games is control responsiveness. This game has *very* responsive controls. With a large number of rooms to explore (not including secret areas, mind you), amusing character dialogs... there's hours of entertainment here. Almost 40 hours in and I still haven't done everything there is to do.
3594	A beautiful, interesting, and soothing game full of pleasing visuals, sounds, and simple gameplay. I bought this in a sale and put off playing it for some reason, but when a â¥â¥â¥â¥-tier day came along this was the perfect antidote for my stress. Love it.
3595	This game is amazing. There are three sections to the game. The first two act as a tutorial of sorts. The third section is where the game truly begins. It offers a huge, interesting world that is full of secrets to uncover. This is an exploratory game that offers just enough story to keep your interest at bay. Some areas require difficult platforming abilities, but overall this game is a must-play for world-exploring gamers. The art and music are both beautiful. This is a game you can pick up after a stressful day to loose yourself in.
3596	If you've played Knytt Stories and Within a deep forest, you know how the mechanics for Knytt Underground work. (If you haven't played them, go and do so. They're free, and give a good grasp of the feel of Nifflas' games)  What really differentiates Knytt Underground from Nifflas' prior work is the story. I've seen all too many reviews disregard the story, saying it's weak. An awful lot of reviewers have evidently missed what the story is. The central plot is not the story. It's little more than a framing work, something to give you a reason to go and explore the hauntingly beautiful landscape.  The real story is on the side-lines. It's about religion, and whether it matters if there's a god, and WHY it matters to people whether or not there is. It's about the good, the bad and the ugly of faith and belief and all the little insecurities of life. It's supported in this by a very human cast. (Which is vaguely amusing given the lack of humans present.) I actually cared about Dora, and Cilia, and even the little side characters who did little but add flavour to the world, building it up to something that feels real.  My love of this game can only be aptly compared to my love of the works of Tove Jansson, whose Moomin series holds a strong resemblance to the work.  Let this vaguely aimed and rambling essay tell you: This game is worth it.
3597	An exploration platformer where you can switch between the tight wall-climbing controls of Knytt and the fast bouncy-ball controls of Within a Deep Forest.  The game mainly provides an excuse to explore a huge, beautiful world. Some of the game's areas are easy to traverse and mainly exist to be looked at, but there is also plenty of tough platforming for those who seek it out. The control-switching feature makes for interesting challenges and feels well-suited to smooth, efficient movement when exploring (although you might prefer to slow down and admire the backgrounds). Furthermore, the game is overflowing with secrets, to the point of having secrets nested within secrets.  The game stars a mute sprite named 'Mi' and later a pair of fairies that speak for her - your interactions with other NPCs serve to characterize the trio. The game is sometimes silly, but it also sometimes touches on weighty issues. The world's inhabitants, despite being mythical creatures, are relatable and act very human.  An excellent game, well worth your time.
3598	Beautiful Graphic. Amazing Sound. Well written Dialogues. Great Game for a small price.
3599	As a fantasticly atmospheric game, with top notch platforming and a well written and unique story, Knytt Underground is my favorite game of 2013.
3600	Knytt Underground is a massive game. Prepare to spend over a dozen hours exploring every nook and cranny, collecting every collectable, and completing every sidequest. Its puzzles are challenging, and at times infuriating, but trekking through its fascinating world is rewarding enough in and of itself. 8.8/10.
3601	YES, YES, YES, and YES. I love the heck out of this game. It is all about exploration and dark tones. By base the game map is 1,440 rooms and this DOES NOT include additional secret areas. You can get lost looking around for hours on end.  Buy it if you like: Metroidvanias, exploration, forgiving deaths, creepy soundtracks, item collection.  Avoid it if you: Need to kill things, need to upgrade your character, can't stand physics puzzles.
3602	Great platforming game with some very nice artwork. What I really liked about it is that once you're out of the tutorial/prologue bit you have all the abilities you're going to get. So you'll never encounter something you're unable to get because you don't have the right skills yet. If you can see it, you can get it. Huge map with lots of secrets to find, some interesting characters to meet and a decent story.
3603	Very fun world to run around in. The characters are extremely well written with very interesting arcs. Ending's a bit rubbish though. Even the characters themselves acknowledge it.
3604	More than a half a year I finished this game and I still load it up often because of the atmosphere. Nicklas put down a masterpiece.  I'm just typing then deleting words because I can't find the best way to describe this game. I almost every day listen to the music. It's perfect before sleep. I think I saw every secret in the game what took me 34 hours to discover (+ the story) what is in my opinion perfect for a platformer game. And for 7 dollars... Must buy. I wish I could time travel and play it again from the beginning without knowing what's going to happen.
3605	I want to start the review of Knytt Underground with one statement up front: I do not believe it to be a bad game, exactly. It does what it sets out to do, and does it well. The problem is that Knytt Undeground intends from a game design standpoint is not what I enjoy from games of its genre. I knew from the outset that the game is somewhat unconventional, but hoped I would enjoy it regardless. I did, for a time.  What the game does right:   Despite taking place underground, the game has a wide variety of backgrounds to its locations that can be quite beautiful.   The game prepares you relatively well for its platforming mechanics, which effectively make a great deal of its rooms into puzzles.   The feeling of finally making the tricky series of jumps required for some of the exploration/puzzles is satisfying.   The setting, if not the plot, is intriguing.   Why I lost interest regardless:   The first two chapters of the game are brief and relatively linear, and basically tutorials for the extremely non-linear chapter 3. The lack of any sense of focus in chapter 3 felt more to its detriment than benefit.   After the beginning of chapter 3, the player receives no new abilities that change the gameplay in any significant way. Powerups are instead temporary, scattered through the map for the specific purpose of navigating one or a few rooms.   Because of the temporary nature of powerups and unchanging nature of the player's capabilities, the game lost all sense of progression. I could explore the third chapter's map to its loosely defined goals, but never felt rewarded for doing so outside satisfying my own curiosity. I did just that for a few hours, before the lack of perceived advancement made Knytt Underground more boring than entertaining.   So, do I recommend Knytt Undeground? Yes and no. Do you feel that exploration is its own reward? Then by all means, play it. Is curiosity alone enough for you to play a game for hours on end? If so, you'll probably have a good time. Do you need greater motivation in gameplay terms than either of those things, as I did? Then, unfortunately, Knytt Underground probably won't be very satisfying.   I genuinely wanted to like the game, and I hope others do, but it was not for me.
3606	It's a good platformer with nice graphics, good control, and a solid story line. The puzzles are light but at the same time not too easy.  Subjective: ââââââ¬ Objective: âââââ â Graphics: âââ â Content: âââ â Handling: âââ   http://played.today/knytt_underground.html    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xM50hROCaGk  
3607	Awesome world,clever puzzle,huge map,many secret   11/10
3608	Almost as good as dropping acid and playing with corks in a darkened room for three hours.
3609	Knytt Underground is a truly wonderful platformer.  It has some really nice and smartly designed platforming mechanics. For most of the game you can switch to a ball at will, which has its own style of gameplay seperate from your normal self. And this interaction between the two generates some truly fun, if at times frustrating, platforming challenges.  There are 3 main chapters to the game, there are also side areas, which are even more challenging however all of them are hidden and you have to discover them for yourself. The first two chapters are more like introductions to the gameplay and the story. The third chapter is where everything takes off and you find a truly massive game underneath (for a platformer).  It's just a shame that it's so badly let down by its last third (not the third chapter itself, only the last part of it), the platforming becomes a chore, and the pay off in the end, storywise, is virtually non existant.  In the end speaking as someone who doesn't really enjoy platformers, especially sidescrolling ones, all that much I'd take this as a glowing endorsment to anyone who is into platformers.  7 Â½ / 10
3610	My only hope is that this game will stand forevermore as a reminder of the evils of liberalism. 'Oh but it's lush.' 'Oh but Within a Deep Forest once brought me such joy as a young babby boy.' No... this can't happen here.
3611	
3612	one of the best indie out there
3613	I was trying to get the steam cards so I can bought dota 2 chests, and for accident I got hooked with this game, very relaxing atmosphere, I really like the use of colours and weird animated backgrounds, you can expend a lot of time trying to figure out what you are looking but I never felt frustrated thanks to the music and the view, great game I totally recommend it :)
3614	I turned into a ball. I also found a secret area that led me to another secret area that had a secret area inside of it. That made me feel good about myself.
3615	this post-apocolipstick mystical adventure, starring a young woman named 'Rubber Ball,' will have you on the edge of your seat, laying back in your seat and enjoying the atmosphere. if you like secrets, 'Knytt Subterrain' vidcon has the secrets that YOU want to SEE (pinky promise)
3616	I love the exploration aspect of this game, always wondering what fantastic sights I'll bump into next. The music is sparse, but fits perfectly. In fact, the soundtrack of Knytt Underground is one of my favorites.  If you like metroidvania-games, then this is a game for you, but keep in mind that the focus of this game is on exploration, and enjoying the atmosphere, not action.
3617	A decent enough platformer, with tight controls and a huge world (in the final chapter). Well-written dialogue and compelling charactes with surprising depth given the humorous tone of the overall story.
3618	I've played all of Niffas' games. Within a Deep Forest, Knytt, Knytt Stories, a bunch of Knytt stories community modules, Saira, and Nightsky. This...this is not a fun game. I wanted to like it, but frankly it's just as disappointing as I found Nightsky.  There are two main problems. First, the -mood- of the game is terrible. Yes, it's called 'Underground', but the art style and background style is far far too gloomy. The aesthetics are just a huge turn-off. The background images tend to be real images or 3d rendered images that seem completely out of place. The terrain is simply all black. The color palette for the entire game is a poorly chosen collection of neons and gray hues, clashing with the cartoonish style. It's just all terrible.  Second, the gameplay isn't any good. The dev has had 5 games to polish it up, but the new mechanics introduced like switches and really inaccurate swinging are more annoying than fun. Add to that the focus on 'new things' means there's little focus on making good classic Knytt platforming and the game suffers for it. All in all, a big fat Do Not Recommend.
3619	Although I have appreciated many of Nifflas' previous games, including the previous game in this series, Knytt Stories, I cannot recommend this game because it lacks one thing: heart. While retaining similar mechanics to previous games (running, jumping, exploration and fetch quests), the games adds in a lot more characters and dialogue making it a somewhat 'chatty' experience. But the dialogue is tacky. It feels like something I would think was cool in middle school, and if I was trying to write something in a second language. The scenery consists of photoshopped fruits and hardware that feels tacked on, like early 90's CG in action movies. The story is juvenile and plodding. The game forces is episodic, and each episode ends up with you retracing places you've been before, but rather than being part of the exploration or platforming it's just something that makes you run back and forth.  These games are all about the atmosphere and solid mechanics as you explore an otherwise featureless world for vaguely defined reasons. The formula didn't work so well in this incarnation. To sum up: cringe-worthy characters and dialogue, passionless art, less-interesting level design than previous fare. Only for hardcore Nifflas fans, or if you're really bored, I guess.
3620	Bought this game on the humble store, plugged in my controller, but it did not work in this game to my surprise. Looked on the forums, the developer suggests joy2key. Took me about an hour to configure this program, since he provided no tutorial or profile. Turns out you have to set the threshold for analog input to about 50% in joy2key and you have to show all axes otherwise your triggers won't work. Way too difficult and cumbersome for an average consumer. So now, if I want to play this game with a controller, I first have to start joy2key, then the game and afterwards, don't forget to quit joy2key otherwise it will mess with other games. The developer says that it was too difficult to implement controller support or something like that. But then I found out that this game is available for the PS3 as well.
3621	i have never played a game that is as boring as this.. 5/5
3622	Great game. I would recommend you to buy it once the price drops under $5. It's a nice platformer not heavily relient on gameplay mechanics but more on visuals. Again if you can buy it for under $5 I totally recommend it. Especially if you liked games such as Braid. Dear Esther and other visual games
3623	So easy and was very zen. Got for free with ign prime....
3624	good music and really good art
3625	This game is one of the best 2D platformers that has ever existed. It's got great mechanics and clever puzzle design. Moving around has this unique fluidity to it. The levels are made so the player has a lot of freedom to explore but there are enough obstacles to challenge them. Also the world building in this game is so great I actually want to live in this game. Hooray for not-cardboard-cutout NPCs and gorgeous graphics!
3626	One of the best side-scrolling platformers of all time. The story won't be for everyone, but the game mechanics are extremely well tuned and it's fun to keep exploring (GREAT soundtrack too). 9/10
3627	Very beautiful, peaceful and original, an special mention to the excellent music and sound quality. The only con is the inexistent support for controllers.
3628	This is like Castlevania/Metroid, except take out all the combat and just have the exploration. Lots of cool environments but it gets old when it's a 30x45 size map.  6/10  And then there's like no reward for finding items and completing quests. You just get a thanks from the npc and that's it most of the time.
3629	Barring the fact that this game cemented the style that Nifflas apparently refuses to stop using, I was pretty enamored with Knytt Underground. With past experience playing both Knytt and NightSky, you could be forgiven for saying that KU is something of a midway point between the two, with the sprite design of the former and background and atmosphere of the latter.  The controls take a bit of getting used to, but are eventually smooth and fluid and make for a lot of moments that make the player feel like a badass. There is a bit of flab in the plot, and I eventually defaulted to skipping the majority of the dialogue, but there's something innately satisfying about exploring, pulling off jumping puzzles, and finding all the little nooks and crannies in the map that would otherwise go unexplored. The tone isn't too light-hearted but also(thankfully) doesn't feel the need to take itself seriously, and the background design has this amazing, almost Pikmin-esque quality to it that looks incredible.   EDIT: I wrote this review right as I was beginning to explore the full map that's revealed to the player a fair bit into the game. I will say that the map is kind of ridiculously huge, and the fetchquests get way, way too numerous to care about or keep track of. Also, something I failed to mention in the beginning is that the sprites look pretty odd, and it doesn't seem to be a stylistic choice. In-game character sprites all have this very weird look to them that makes it hard to take any serious moments seriously.  HOWEVER. Everything I already said still stays true. Satisfying mechanics, beautiful backgrounds and atmosphere. Buy it anyway despite its occasional flabbiness.
3630	So, so much to see and do in the last chapter. Reminds me of some of the gigantic levels for pure exploration in Knytt Stories, only with more bouncing. And Cilia.
3631	I have been a big fan of Nifflas' games since Knytt Stories, and that game inspired me to play through Knytt and Within a Deep Forest. This game is essentially a mash-up of those two games, and it does very well.
3632	in many ways, for me, a therapeutic, spiritual - i think the word 'zenlike' is used in the description and it's apt. gorgeous, soothing visuals and soundtrack; tight controls; puzzle platforming ranging from easily doable to devastatingly brutal, but always cleverly and fairly designed; a story that's partly just a bunch of tropes and jokes but sneakily filled with subtle moments of heart and bittersweet character development. the open world is massive (beyond the first two chapters, which function as tutorials) and a pleasure to explore, full of small side quests, collectibles, and secrets beyond the main quest, all of which you can finish at your leisure and as quickly or methodically as you like. very little content is gated once you enter the true game in the third chapter; you're free to take off in any direction you see fit and are really only held back by how well you understand the game's physics and control of your character.  it's not for everyone - some would call it empty, but i would say it's anything but... look, i know it makes me pretentiously indie, but it's one of my favorite games. there's something simultaneously ethereal and human about it that i've never felt in a game before or since. if that makes sense and appeals to you, this is a game for you.
3633	This is a nice little puzzle/platformer with quite a big world to go through - and per chapter you have a different character so it keeps things interesting. I like the graphics, and play this mostly for it's relaxing qualities. For a small price it is definately worth it. Just note that the focus is more on the puzzle element, and not on the action - and you might find the game a bit too simple.
3634	This game is gorgeous. The graphics remind me of Limbo, except where Limbo concentrates on darkness and negative space, Knytt uses colorful backgrounds that seem whimsically out of place in the underground setting. The actual gameplay is a bit on the casual side, though some of the jumping puzzles can be difficult to pull off on the first try. The game is mostly about exploration, and with imagry like this, I kept exploring just to see what the next screen would look like.   If you like your games a bit on the artsy side, this one's for you. 
3635	Amazing game! A more complex experience than the previous Knytt games but without losing its charm.
3636	Knytt Underground is a nice break from the modain platformers.
3637	This is no Knytt Stories. If you haven't played Knytt Stories play that for sure (it's free). At first I thought this was going to be short and pretty boring. It turns out Chapter 1 and 2 might as well be tutorial levels. The game opens up on Chapter 3 and will take you quite a while to play through. It's essentially a game of exploration. You never unlock new abilities or powers, and mostly you will be collecting items to open doors (although you can get around many of them if you are clever).  The game has a huge world so expect a lot of backtracking. There is a fast travel system if you want but it also involves exploring. Expect lots of secrets and to be rewarded for exploring. A lot of people have complained about the ending and I understand. It's pretty anti-climactic, so don't expect some incredible revelation.  All in all, a definitely good game worthy of your time. Nifflas, if you are reading this, I love your games. One gripe, up should not be jump! Have a dedicated jump key distinct from up please!
3638	Playing this game makes me feel quite comfortable. Its art style tends to dark color but wouldn't let me feel dark. Its detail of texture is kind of vague beauty. Applicable to casual gamer. Oh! I play it on Desura, not on Steam.
3639	My first introduction to Nifflas' games was 'Within a Deep Forest' followed shortly by 'Knytt.' Both titles provided fantastic exploration, with a stunning sense of place delivered by a low key asthetic. Platforming was thoroughly enjoyable, challenging, without ever being unfair, although that is not to say it wasn't occasionally frustrating.  Knytt Underground continues the pattern set in these earlier games. In my mind its the first of Nifflas' premium games to recapture the charm of the simple graphics of the earlier games, while maintaining the visual richness of more recent titles. The metroidvania style progression has been tuned back, in favour of a couple of tutorial chapters and a few obviously gated sections. Initially I was a bit disapointed by the change, but the satisfaction of returning to a challenge and beating it at a later date, because  you  were better, not your character, is immensely satisfying.  I was a bit concerned after finishing the first couple of chapters so quicky, but the third chapter is sprawling, with tucked away non-critical path challenges to keep even the hardcore happy.   There's a bit more written narrative going on here than in other Nifflas games, but it's pleasingly well written, and primarily acts to frame the fetch-quests, while fleshing out your fairy companions. 
3640	If you like exploring amazing unique places jampacked with rewarding secrets on a massive journey intoxicated and don't mind a little bit of bad writing and a slow first 15 minutes then get this.  Chapter 3 is when the game really opens up. S is to transform into a ball and A is for abilities.
3641	I just came over this little gem of a game. The graphics and sounds are good, and the platforming feels amazingly fluid, there's a lot of it there too, after 4 hours now, I probably have explored less than 2/3 of the map. The story is good, and brings a smile on my face, a really good game for unwinding. I'm also happy that it's a game where it's mostly you as a player against the environment, and not so much monster, a really solid game, and well worth getting.
3642	Fantastic platform-action-adventure game, one of the best in its genre. Despite Knytt's apparent simplicity and narrow gameplay possibilities (well, you're bouncing ball or girl who is fantastic climber), game brings lots of fun. What is more, gameplay isn't the most amazing part of this game. Actually, I wasn't expecting such good plot in this game at the beginning, but Dora and Cillia talk about really important things in life of every one of us, also society of Knytt shows some real world problems. Another good thing is that there are TONS of hidden places, which contain items and sometimes Steam achievements. In fact, to unlock any achievement you have to be extremely lucky or find a good achievement guide, as I did.  Anyway, this game is really awesome and anyone who likes platform games will love this one too.
3643	This gams has amazing 2D graphics. Very Soft. It has a really odd and mysterious storyline. Pretty Nice Game! But I think the characters need better style. I mean they shouldn't had white limbs.
3644	If you like to discover and explore, then you'll like knytt.
3645	Best exploration game i've played in long time. It may be funny, too.
3646	This game is a joy to play. Not particularly difficult, but it has a beautiful, large area to explore.  This builds off of the 'Within a deep forest' universe, so it might be a good idea to play that first, but it isn't necessary.
3647	It just so amazing as all of Nifflas' Games. What can I say more about it? Highly recommended if you addicted to atmospheric platformers.
3648	I went in expecting a few hours of just another neat-looking puzzle platformer and wound up starting one of the most memorable video game journeys I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. You mostly have complete freedom in Knytt Underground's world, comprised of about 50 x 30 rooms, and you can tell the developer put a lot of passion into every single one of them. While the main storyline may not be exactly brilliant, I found myself so fascinated with the world, the characters and the puzzles that I kept wanting to return, eager to see where my next adventure would take me. This is much more of an exploration game than a puzzle one: it is not the destination that matters here but the journey itself, and there are dozens and dozens of secrets scattered around just waiting to be found, the characters are also surprisingly fun and well-written, and some puzzles very cleverly crafted. My only complaint is that due to its open-worldy nature and the sometimes overwhelming freedom that you're given, the pacing will often feel a bit off.
3649	relaxing, peaceful, but you may get stuck sometimes.
3650	A great adventure/exploration game with beautiful graphics and music. All that is accompanied by a non-trivial story unfolding in the background of the plot. Also: be prepared for surprises!  I would not recommend this for children below, say, 10 yrs.
3651	One of my favorite games ever. A huge world to explore, beautiful environments and music, more secrets you can shake a stick at (seriously, I have a lot of hours in this game, and I feel like I find a new area every time I play. Sometimes there are secrets in secrets in secrets)... but most surprisingly, some truly thoughtful moments that leave you pensive and eager to discover more.
3652	Beautiful, fun, hilarious, sad, aggrivating, mystifying and above all, haunting.   Remember that feeling you get when you're all alone, feeling the wind on your face and watching the stars, late at night?   Nifflas has distilled that into game form.   Buy it, and always - ALWAYS - send Cilia.

10944	First, allow me to tell you that I'm only going to be rating this product on solely what it is, I will not be comparing it to other products. Content in this review is subject to change when the product gets modified. If you would like to contact the developers with your opinions about this product or suggest future updates, contact them at   support@digitaldnagames.com  .  Since its launch on Steam in February 2014 this game has been criticized for having a multitude of issues ranging from having absolutely no graphic or control settings to no communication options. Recently, this product has  implemented  the following:  â  Resolution settings.  You can now change the resolution in-game! â  Render distance settings.  Lowest, Low, Medium, High, and Ultra. â  Texture quality settings.  Low, Medium and High.  These settings were needed in order to call this a PC game. Now that these issues have been addressed, allow me to criticize some of the things they have recently implemented and the things they still haven't. They recently implemented a fairly large health bar at the top of the screen. I find this rather odd considering health in Castle Miner Z almost immediately regenerates. I would prefer if I could move this around or just turn it off all together. Along with a nice retexture of every block in the game, they've also added a new blue user interface.  The game still lacks a variety of enemies, blocks, an antialiasing setting and a voice chat system. Also, text communication is rather limited. For example, if I wanted to say 'Hello everyone, how are you all doing?' I would only have 5 characters left afterward. You also do not have the ability to paste characters.

This is serious, what's the point in playing in the first place if everything you accomplish is refreshed after every major update?  â  Lack of Voice Chat Functionality.  Currently the only means of communication in-game is a very limited text system.  â  Lack of NPC Variety.  Understandably not every game has to have 30+ different models of enemies but different reskins of dragons, zombies, skeletons and Demons with the same exact sound effects just aren't enough.  â  Lack of Block Variety.  A larger variety of things to craft with resources would have been great additions. Dirt, rock, wood, ore, Bloodstone, weapons, explosives, doors, and walls is what I would expect from an Alpha.   Many of you commenting think I am hypocritical by spending over 300 hours in this game, I find this rather absurd. If anything, you should consider the time I spent on this game as thorough testing of the product. For those of you wondering, 2/3 of the time I spent playing this game went towards an achievement that requires you run the game consecutively for 100 hours. The first time I attempted this achievement the memory leakage was so horrid it immbolized my PC after the first three days. I tried it once again in windowed mode and succeeded.
10945	CastleMiner Z introduces a completely new genre to the gaming industry, in which a player is set in a randomly generated sandbox world with nothing but blocks to survive and thrive. It also has zombies. Also never done before. and Skeletons with Bows. Never seen it. You can also go to a hell-like underworld with zombies and fortresses. This is like the greatest game ever made. broke the scale, I can't even rate.
10946	the creators abandoned the game
10947	Imagine minecraft.  Now imagine it's not very good.
10948	CastleMiner Z.. where do I even begin? CastleMiner Z is a Voxel FPS Horror game where your only goal seems to survive or go farther from your starting point, and go progress to get higher tiers to fight the zombies with.  First of all, the graphics; They are very poor and need work, and a lot of times glitch out.  Secondly there's the Gameplay: The gameplay is decent, but get's very repetitive, with nothing much to do other than go farther away from spawn and try not to die. The guns are very unabalanced and need work aswell. For a survival game, suprisingly you don't have to eat or anything, you can literally just sit in a hole in a mountain or something and not get killed ever, and once you're aware of that it becomes very stale.  Third of all, Optimization: This game isn't optimized very well, and has laggy FPS even on good computers. The porting from Xbox 360 to PC/Steam is poor aswell and feels like they put no effort into it. Even the Xbox 360 controller buttons are still there. It's missing basic features like a ingame chat that should be there already.  Lastly, the bugs. This game has a lot of bugs, like.. a lot of bugs. How could a game be released like this? Sonic 06 all over again. This game is okay, but needs imporvement, I wouldn't recommend it right now.   I'd recommend making this a early access game if possible, it has potential, but it feels like your not using it. It's very lacking right now. 04/10 at it's current state (1.6.3.3)
10949	This game is terrible. It is a blatant minecraft ripoff, but with guns. Now, I can't go into the specifics, as it has been several months since I have played, but I recommend you just save your money and get the normal minecraft. I'm glad I got this game for free!  EDIT: I recommend reading my arguments in the comments if you would like to defend Castle Miner Z, as I go over some important points. Besides this note, I have not edited my original review.
10950	I would rather drag my testicles though 70 miles of broken glass and rusty nails than play this game for another 15 minutes.
10951	Such a shame. Graphics are nice, (except for the amount of dust while mining obscuring the block you're aiming at). Nice, dark feel. A promising crafting system and potential for so much more. Unfortunately, as far a I can tell, nothing of any significance had happened since last May.  It's almost as if the developers have released a half-finished project for sale and just cut and run with the money. Kickstarter projects and early release accesses require a certain element of trust.   To my mind, and I'm sorry for all the honourable, hard-working, independant developers out there, this has put me off funding/supporting projects-in-development for good. 
10952	This game is awful. About as fun as a sandpaper handjob.
10953	First off, this game needs a LOT of work. It's fun, but there's not much here. The only things that you can craft are basic building blocks from wood gathered, tools (just like the ones in Minecraft), and an assortment of guns. It's too simple! There's no need to make a crafting table in order to make better weapons, there's no form of armor, and there's no need to build a furnace to smelt the ore that you've collected during your mining adventures. I can't stress this enough. It's too simple!  Secondly, the game is really hard, despite it's simplicity. Even playing on Easy mode, the zombies would kill me in just 3 hits, which is ridiculous. To make matters worse, when you die, all of the items in your inventory are gone. Poof, vanished into thin air, so even if you manage to get back to where you were killed, you can't collect any of your stuff that you had worked so hard for. Oh, and did I mention that the zombies spawn almost right next to you? Yeah, random spawn points for ALL of the enemies, based entirely on where you are. In other words, you are the spawn point for enemies. It's really unfair, especially when they take an entire clip to kill, can run at you faster than you can run yourself, and can kill you in 3 F#$KING HITS EVEN ON EASY MODE! Oh yeah, and a Dragon will come by and F#$k your s#$t up royally every couple of days...  Which brings me to my next issue. The day/night cycle on this game is absurd. Days only last a few minutes at best, and the night lasts forever! I got into the game, was looking through the UI for the crafting and by the time I had understood how everything worked, it was night time and I was getting my face ripped off by a zombie. It's ludicrous how short the days are and how long the nights are. SERIOUSLY needs to be reworked.  Lastly, and this is just a nitpicky thing, the sensitivity is really high, and even when you adjust it, it doesn't change anything. When you're in standard view, if you twitch in any direction, you'll practicially do a 180, but when you aim down the sight, you're lucky to get the damn thing to move. It's very unpolished. Honestly, I'd stick to Minecraft if you're looking for a sandbox crafting type game, it has way more to do, the enemies are balanced and won't continually spawn right next to you, and if you die, you can at least get your stuff back (if you manage to get back to the spot where you died fast enough)
10954	Do you really need me to tell you that this is bad
10955	This review will not be helpful:  This is the dumbest thing ever.
10956	I came into this being a fan of minecraft and an avid player of it.  This was of course made as a replacement of minecraft on the xbox but moving it over to pc is simply a mistake.   Graphics... minecraft kills it especially with texture packs, the guns... easily moddable, gameplay...boring unless trolling people in mp    You want a blocky survival game go for minecraft, a small price to pay for a much better game which is excactly the same idea.    With minecraft around, there is simply no reason for this game on pc, it is inferior in every way to the original even though all the basic mechanics are the same.   Basically a clone of a far more superior game, for xbox fine but on pc we have minecraft!!
10957	no resolution settings and ambiguous error messages on 4/5 connections I attempt to make with player hosted servers. This is the first purchase I've ever made on steam that I have regretted enough to email steam's support and ask for a refund. â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ pc game at release, should have been far more polished before it was allowed through Steam's vetting system. Seems to me like they're trying to make a quick buck and it makes me sick.  Edit: As of tonight (1.5 days after emailing steam support) I have yet to receive a response....  Steam has lost me as a customer unless or until I am able to get this resolved.  First I'd like to say that I purchased this game on the xbox and actually really enjoyed it but it is lacking major technical features for a full steam release title on the pc. Steam should have labeled this release as an early access title!  DigitalDNA Games, for you I have just spent 30 minutes troubleshooting your game, these are my results which are the same issues I was running into yesterday. Also I tested it on two known good systems both yesterday and today and I have a reasonably good internet connection: ping 25ms, DL 165 mbps, UL 8 mbps.  On both systems I occasionally experience an error where after selecting 'Play online' I am presented with the message 'connecting... please wait...' but the message just continues to flash and never disappears. I have waited as long as 5 minutes to no avail.   I seem to run into this error about 1/5 times.  When I am able to access the list of player servers I am having slightly better luck today, but still about 1/2-3/4 of the times I try to connect to one I am presented with an ambiguous error message of no use to me in troubleshooting whatever problem may exist. The text of this error is as follows:  'Connection Error  Connection failed: Host Disconnected  Ok'  Also if I accidently try to join a server that requires a password, the cancel button on the dialogue box allowing you to enter a password does not work. When I click it nothing happens at all. I have to select ok which takes me to the same ambiguous error message as above and then to the main menu.  Now that I have gone out of my way to reinstall your game and spent about 45 minutes to an hour of my time troubleshooting for you, I would ask that you contact me directly or through steam and offer me a refund on the $8.49 that I spent yesterday on your hastily released title.    2nd edit: The steam support ticked I opened that has yet to receive a response is ticket #5897-WEYV-9696.
10958	don't get this game,playing this game feels like eating diarrhea.
10959	I think I was gifted this game for a joke, it is awful. Do not buy.
10960	You know, one of my good friends saw this game, and very strongly suggested that I buy it.  Me, being a little overly trusting for my own good, immediately purchased this game. I started reading the reviews to this game, and started to get the idea that I may have made a little mistake. After playing through a bit of the Endurance game mode, I started to wonder,'What else could I have done with the $10 I spent on this game?' Hmmmmm... I could have: Saved this in my bank account.  Bought about a month of Netflix. Could've even bought like, 5 Klondike bars! Then, playing some more, I thought,'You know, I think that with the $10 dollars I spent on this game, I would have RATHERED: Dropped this money somewhere on the street. Given it to a homeless person to go towards his new leg. ACTUALLY bought WinRAR. Funded a government program towards teaching 4th graders 4-Dimentional Geometry. I could have used it to feed a starving family in Africa. OH, I know; I Could have soaked a ten dollar bill in kerosene, placed it on my forehead, and LIT IT ON FIRE. I could have slit my own throat with this ten dollar bill, and found it better used.  All in all, I've seen ten year olds create a more original and better made game with Crayons. Go ahead, Buy It.
10961	If someone's going to rip off Minecraft, it could be done a lot better than this.  The addition of guns is pretty cool, along with crafting ammunition and whatnot, but that's about it for positives. The animations are poor, the enemies are faster than you and can kill you in two hits even on Easy, and so on. There's a very small window of things you can craft that aren't weapons. There's no brightness adjustment (it says brightness in the options menu but is really a bad gamma balancer) which is terrible because the game is very dark, especially since it's never anything but cloudy.  All in all, I very much love the concept of this game, but it was attempted very very poorly.  3/10
10962	Would rather buy winrar
10963	Minecraft with some mods and a texture pack.
10964	This was my most worthless purchase ever. I played for 7min then I regreted that I bought it and wished that I would have bought a foot long sandwitch at subway instead. :(
10965	2/10 I only played for 30 minutes, and this game already gave me cancer. There is no mouse sensitivity settings in which it desperately needs, The textures reminds me of a generic playstation 2 game. And the worst part is the only chance I had of having fun in this game blew it, I had just ran into a dragon and was trying to take it down. After about 7 or 8 minutes of battle my freaking game crashed. This game has potential, it just needs polishing, ALOT of polishing.  UPDATE: For those of you who aren't smart enough to figure it out, there was no mouse sensitivity setting when I first created this review. I do applaud the effort on making this game better. However, I still find it bland and boring.
10966	 GoldeMan's (very) Lengthy Review of CastleMinerZ!
10967	I was gifted this game by a friend, I can now say I have deleted that friend from my friends list.
10968	This game is purely soleless (or however the heck you spell it). When this came out on Steam, Minecraft had already been out for some years, and has been heavily updated and can be heavily modded, while this game has a severe lack of content (which is a terrible flaw for this type of game), very minor updates and cannot be modded. On top of that, this game costed $0.99 on Xbox 360 before it was discontinued, so why the heck do I have to pay $4.99 for it now, especially considering this game is a sad PC port. Plus, the co-op mode has no in-game chat system whatsoever.  Minecraft's Main Focus (in my opinion): Mining and crafting is the main point, and once you become an unstoppable warlord or whatever with all the best swords, armor, enchantments, etc., there are countless things you can still do afterwards. (someone was actually able to make a fully functionable computer with a crap ton of redstone)  CastleMinerZ's Main Focus (in my opinion): This Minecraft clone has a heavy emphasis on survival, but there's like only 5 different enemies or something like that, and once you've got the best guns and a crap ton of ammo, you're done! There's no point to keep playing because there's nothing else entertaining to do afterwards.  The Verdict:  At Its Best: Crap (seriously, this game is that bad) At Its Worst: Garbage
10969	I'll leave it to Total Biscuit to do the talking:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnNLoMQnLaY   1$ on xbox indie marketplace, 10$ on Steam. Nuff' said.
10970	I am shocked that they still charge money for this game, it could be made much better, but it seems the developers have abandoned the game, yet another steam disaster story. Do not waste money on this 'game' I only got it since it was in a bundle (that actually had some decent games in it)
10971	No info on how to play, the game is buggy and quite frankly is far from engaging to say the least.
10972	This seriously is a mod for Minecraft that adds guns and different textures and animations. Diamonds are so easy to find it's actually funny, and even the best resource, bloodstone, is super-easy to obtain. In the aspect of building, this game has next to no blocks and the best thing you can make is some blocky, symmetrical castle that gets instantly destroyed by dragons that spawn every femtosecond. The enemies take a lot to kill, run faster than you, and kill you in 2 hits on the easiest difficulty.  It gives the option to teleport to the surface, to another player, or to spawn. This is an awful idea since it takes the factor of exploration plus finding your way back away. Most of the fun in Minecraft was getting lost in a huge cave and spending an hour finding your way back out. In this game, it's as simple as going to the menu and clicking 'Teleport' For the money it costed to buy this game, (Luckily I was gifted it...) save it and go buy Terraria or Minecraft. Same games, only better than this.
10973	AVOID! Save your money!
10974	tl;dr Dead multiplayer, lack of tutorial, odd design choices, tedious gameplay.   I suppose an interesting concept and execution if it were original, or made instead as a mod for minecraft (I haven't played it, but there's got to be mods or something like this by now).  I liked the 'atmosphere' and idea behind the game, but it's not very well done. The 'combat' is somewhat clunky, though I've played worse. There's a smoke effect when objects are hit or struck by bullets that make it damn near impossible see what you're actually doing.The concept of scavenging by day and bracing yourself for attack by night are good ideas, but I'm pretty sure that's how Minecraft works (as I said earlier, I've never played the original). Also, zombies leap incredibly far and a single strike can take away a quarter health. If you can avoid being hit for about 3 seconds, you near instantly fully regenerate health.  There doesn't seem to be a set goal or anything to work towards (likely Minecraft's objectives, as well), so that left me experimenting with some game mechanics, all I was able to figure out was to move, shoot zombies on sight, and smack things with a pickaxe, allowing me to reposition the cubes I demolished with said pickaxe.  I wasn't expecting a AAA experience, but the little bit I've heard and the reviews I've read lead to an underwhelming experience on this game. Maybe I'm missing the best of the game, since I couldn't find a single server (not that I was really expecting a huge, dedicated playerbase). Single player might be good to run through it a couple times, but not much more. The game doesn't really make any sense and I don't suppose it's supposed to, but why zombies and dragons?  The best scenario I can imagine with this game is arming yourself to the teeth and trying to survive the night, but I haven't been able to figure out how to actually do this, as it's not worth spending the time in the game to gather the resources, craft the prerequisite items, gather more resources and craft the real items, to burn through everything in a matter of minutes.  In the vast majority of cases, I would not recommend this game to anyone as better alternatives exist and the money can be spent on them, instead. If someone with a few friends all own this title, or decide to all buy it at the same time AND can figure out the best scenario above, maybe a case can be made for this title. Otherwise, steer clear.  My experience was more or less 'bumble about, exhaust ammo and weapons on zombies, die.'
10975	i am writing this review negatively to make my friends who love this game hate me to no end.
10976	This game DEFFINATELY needs many updates...it's like early alpha state, enemies spawn randomly and spawnrape you, health system is weird(you get hit 1-3 times and you die, recovery to full health when not hit for like 3-5 seconds), needs MANY new items to craft like windows,fences and so on... And would be nice if they would add some new NPCs like animals and that, because if they tried to create minecraft clone, at least try to make it a GOOD one! Because right now it feels like total ripoff, i even read about the creator cencorship, that they remove all negative comments. Well, this isnt a negative comment, this is just a recommendation what should be tweaked in this game to make it better.
10977	Length of Time Played: 16 Hours Distance Played: 75% Before Boss  Opinion of Each Aspect (Sorted By Importance)  Gameplay: Abysmal Controls: Acceptable Stability: Good Graphics: Poor Difficulty: Poor Sounds: Acceptable Music: N/A Story: N/A  Other Notes:  Ease of 100% Achievements: Time Consuming and Difficult - Idling is required. A hosted server with at least 2 people is needed for certain achievements. Replay Value: None - Go play Minecraft with some mods. Lack of any crafting: The only things you can craft are pickaxes, spades, axes, torches, crates, teleporters, walls, and an assortment of weapons/ammo. Enemy variety: Fast/slow/ Zombies, Skeletons, Aliens, Dragons. No much in the way of that. No progression: You can get the best stuff within 20 minutes if you get lucky.  Personal Grade: F
10978	I'm going to start by saying, yes, this game is fun, but only to a certain point. After 5 hours or so, I had the highest tier weaponry, and traveled out 10,000 + Blocks. That's only on singleplayer, which is one of this game's weak points. Playing 6+ more hours with my friend was enjoyable, but tedious, and at times, too easy. Enemies couldn't get close enough to our fort to damage it when we reached diamond-tier weapons. On the topic of weapons, there is no armor in this game, so you will be stuck with getting killed in 2-3 hits, if they get close enough to hit you.  Also, their are maybe 5 enemy types in the game: Zombie, Skeleton, Skeletal archer, A demon, and a dragon, each with different coloration of themselves. The Demon (Which me and my friend cleverly called Satan) Spawns in the underworld, and anywhere else randomly after entering hell. This wouldn't be a problem at all, if you could kill the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Normally (I.E by Wiki's standard) you should be able to kill him after obtaining bloodstone weaponry (cleverly, bloodstone is only found in hell.) However, there seemed to of been a glitch which bullets, and even lazer weaponry, would pass right through him. (And the undead dragon). This may have been only in our case, nontheless, unacceptable.  A mentioned earlier, that enemies rarely got close enough to us to hurt us. To dabble on that more, guns after iron tier really are just too powerful. It takes maybe two bullets from an autorifle, which has a clip size of 30, to kill zombies and skeletons. And it takes just under a clip or two to kill a dragon.   To close up this rather long review, when this game goes on sale for 1 dollar (or regional amount) then this is worth the sudo 12 hours you get out of it, otherwise, avoid like the plague.
10979	Not very Good, Not many choices, but characters are funny. and they did a good job with the guns. and how the hell do you kil the DRAGONS!!    So i give it a 4/10
10980	I hate forum-censorship.
10981	waste of your money. flat out do not buy
10982	Edited: Feb 04, 2014  If you are looking for bubblegum for the brain, you certainly found it.  Be sure to read through a lot of the negative feedback (because it is all true at this point). The game has little to no optimization, no avatar customization, and not even the ability to map out your controls... and that sucks.  This is yet another 'poor mans mincraft' that happened to stand out from the crowd of the slapped together junk of the Xbox live indie marketplace section. It has some interesting mechanics and some degree of difficulty to keep someone entertained for usually a few hours at a time. It is in no way a 'work of art' or 'masterpiece' but it doesn't mean it isn't a decent time waster.  Aside from the 'Special Promotion' it got from launching, the game is $10... It's on the Xbox marketplace for $1.  Edit: After playing this game for a bit, im going to have to change my stance on this. It's a game that in no means is worth more than its old $1 price tag. Spending time on this game has a way of showing you what you will play when you're truly bored out of your mind.
10983	Shockingly this game is bad... I know right who would have guessed? 
10984	This game is a disgusting creation. It's like the developers sat down, after taking the entire basis of Minecraft into consideration, and then thought; 'how can we make this game even worse?'   Thus, creating CastleMiner Z.   Excuse me while I go throw up.  updated 6/19/16: game is still awful updated 10/28/16: the game is still awful, and Sergeant Rotado is triggered
10985	Yes only if u enjoy seeing how far you can make it and if u can kill all the dragons ,,,, however if u havent played this before (on the Xbox) then u could find this a totally piece of WTF lol , but if u had and u did enjoy it i would say buy but with friends ,, and maybe wait for it to be 5 bucks or less
10986	This is actually one of the worst games I have ever played in my entire life. It would be more fun to jump off of a bridge into a pit full of rabid Mike Tysons. Thank you Digital DNA Games for creating possibly the worst gaming experience anyone could ever hope to imagine. I'd rather be at work.
10987	Not worth Â£2
10988	Never been this close to suicide
10989	It's like if Minecraft and old school Doom had a baby but then later in the pregnancy they found out they were actually siblings so Minecraft had to abort the deformed fetus and leave it in a bin.
10990	I honestly have no idea why im writing a review for this game but here is my thoughts on the game  its okay challenging has a dragon has aliens okay graphics it can somtimes get very boring  and over all could be better 6/10
10991	CastleMiner Z is an INFINITE WORLD FILLED WITH DEEP PLACES TO EXPLORE AND HORRIFYING MONASTERS TO SLAY... this the description clearly states but when I go into the game all I see is bland crap and some green goo I feel too much pithy for to bother stomping on.  Something went wrong here... very, very wrong. These console indy titles just don't measure up on the real thing.
10992	Let's all thank Valve for letting us refund games now.
10993	Yeah, it sucks. This is the only game that has ever game me suicidal thoughts in such a short period of time.
10994	this was reccomended to me and now i have trust issues
10995	Might be fun with friends if you're just there to dig or do some usless â¥â¥â¥â¥ randomness, and it is extremly un-user-friendly, nothing is easy to do ( not talking about 'surviving' I mean everything else)
10996	Pretty buggy
10997	This game sucks
10998	Ugly unispired mess of a game, bland and boring. There is nothing to explore, horrific monsters to slay are horrificly animated, visuals are laughtable, gameplay is dull, sounds are awful, even procedural generation of terrain always end up generating almost the same terrain (for gameplay reasons I presume, still it's was bad design decision in the first place). At least it's cheap, can't argue with that. You may actually have some fun if you have unfussy friends to play it with you. I have none, thus saying 20 mins of gameplay is enough to never touch this thing again with a ten foot pole Still there is ton of better games.  Also: The game got it's Mostly Positive rating because users are mocking it and making joke reviews.  Also: Released with controller support then cut it out completely in favor of new UI (which is trash anyway). Definition of false advertising.
10999	It's bad, that's all you need to know.
11000	Its a minecraft clone except with guns and crappy quality and was filled with enemies that were THE EXACT SAME ONES AS IN MINECRAFT! Makes no sense why a dragon appears at night and is practically impossible to kill unless you have a bigger gun. But The worst Possible waste of my $2 in my life! could have bought something else! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!
11001	I WONDER WHAT THIS GAME IS TRYING TO CASH IN ON he lied as he stared at the Minecraft clone that has dragons in it because might as well cash in on skyrim while your ripping off Minecraft.  This game is literally just an amazingly poorly made ripoff of Minecraft, except now it has 12 times the edgyness as it has guns. You walk around, kill some horrible looking zombies, get attacked by a dragon with some terrible AI, then mine some minerals and make some guns, build a crappy house, die, then spend 12 hours trying to find your crappy house again. If you want to play a Minecraft style game then buy bloody Minecraft, Its like 27 Dollars, If thats too much for you too pay and you want a cheap alternative, well this isn't it, start saving up those pennies of yours and buy Minecraft. Or alternatively, sell your computer and buy yourself some bloody food. Seriously Don't buy this If you buy this you probably shouldn't be aloud financial independence.  Just like me.
11002	seriously man what the hell is this. bunch of crap if you ask me. big mistakes buying this game. you slags make rip offs and i hope your uncle fred gets a bruise in the right nipple.
11003	Cubes. What's a new? Blocks? Weapons? DRAGONS? GIVE 2 COPIES!!!
11004	I am disguisted by this game
11005	I tried writing this review before I opened the game and then it told me to wait. Well its 5 mins later. AAAAAAAND HERE WE GO.   Welcome to my review ya neckbeard,   This game is free from their website and Gaben is selling it for 2 dollars each.   ITS A TRAP!  DONT DO IT!   GET THE FREE VERSION!  GABEN HAZ ENOUGH SHEKELS!  0_o  Seriously though. Its free....I feel like i just gave a guy 2 dollars for a glass of water, then the glass of water turned out to be full of nails and smallpox, and then I turned around and saw the guy I gave my 2 dollars to drinking out of a clean water fountain.    Well I gotta go swan dive off my roof now. This game melted my steel beams.   All hail our 8 foot tall lizard men overlords.
11006	Well this actually wasnt a bad game besides my review, it just wasnt for me, not my style and dont know why I bought it. I still give it a 6 outta 10 and recommend it to anyone who wants to play Minecraft meets 7 Days to Die....on drugs!!!
11007	Why I don't Recommend this game: - Multiplayer is empty. - Achievements only Unlock on Singleplayer. - Is Minecraft with Guns. - Xbox360's Version is better than this one. If your thinking of Buying this Game, I don't Recommend it! Better buy it on Xbox360 which is Cheaper and Better!
11008	Pretty bad game. It is optimized very poorly and makes fps drop a lot. This game should not have come onto pc, it should just have stayed on xbox.
11009	This feels like something me and a few friends could whip up in Unity in like a week.
11010	To begin, CastleMiner Z is a 3D sandbox game with a block-like filled environment that features a large variety of weapons and a few items that the player can craft, as well as dragons to fight, with zombies, skeletons, and aliens to kill. It does not compare itself to Minecraft, Infiniminer, Fortresscraft, or Total Miner whatsoever and should never be considered a 'spin-off' of any of these games.   CastleMiner is a decent game from what I've experienced. Playing offline seems like a lot of fun... and it really is. However, I do have a lot of problems to mention about this game.   1.   Zombies are too fast and kill too often, almost impossible to kill.   This is a common issue on CastleMiner Z. As the player encounters a zombie anywhere on the map, they will most likely start to run fast, targeting the player, and lunges at them, usually dealing 40% damage on the player when the player only has 100 health. Sometimes this is even more of a problem because the zombie has the ability to clip through the player, allowing the zombie to hit the player twice as fast and dealing more damage than expected. Zombies are just too fast when they are running at the player. It's not easy to shoot them when you got a Pistol that only has 200 Bullets when they're jumping around like nuts. Also, they are literally impossible to actually kill. I have to use up almost all of my 8 rounds to take out a single zombie, and my aim is very accurate, these zombies seem to have a lot more health than what the player actually has.   2.   The game does not have that many blocks nor items to allow the player to use.   There are only a certain amount of blocks in this game. Let's say if I wanted to do pixel art in this game, the chances of me doing so would be certainly low. You cannot obtain or craft coloured blocks in this game at all, which IMO looks very dull. I should be able to go into Creative mode and know that there will be more blocks for me to use, however there isn't.   'So, what blocks did you encounter in the game today, bud?',  'Grass, trees, grass, sand, grass, grass, rock, grass, dirt, and more grass.'    3.   I chopped down 7 trees, none of them grow back.   I don't even realize if this is a bug or if this wasn't even bothered to be implemented to the game yet, but I figured that trees in the game do   not   grow back. This might be a stupid example, but if I wanted to craft 100 Doors, and I didn't have enough wood because all of my trees are chopped down, would they grow back? Well, from what I have seen, I don't think they do. Trees in this game are good for the first time you chop them down, but going to them the second time, they are practically useless. All you have left from these trees are leaves, and they never seem to decay at all.  Oh, and you can walk through these leaves. They're not solid blocks.   4.   Stamina is pointless and runs out too quickly.   I'm always playing in Survival and there is always a Stamina bar, correct? Stamina is pointless to me most of the time, but other times could be useful. It allows you to double-jump (pressing SPACE twice) and allows you to sprint (LEFT SHIFT). A problem I occassionally have with this is that Stamina runs out too quickly, though. I even timed myself to see how quick Stamina actually runs out for. After approximately   2 seconds   of sprinting, your Stamina goes from 100% to 0% instantly. Wow, how useful is that. I could   totally   run out a zombie in this game.   And finally...   5.   Hosts on multiplayer games, they're all idiots.   This has to be one of the worst things I have actually experienced when playing CastleMiner Z, the hosts on multiplayer servers. I might as well just not play Multiplayer at all because I feel hatred whenever I join a game. Fun fact, I joined   20   sessions in one day. I've been kicked from all of them because ALL of the hosts tell me the same thing:   '  Sorry, friends only!  '  '  Gtfo noob  '   ...or just kick me for no good reason. They're acting like immature people. I haven't done anything wrong to these people, and I am clueless of who they are, and they kick me from games when I did absolutely nothing wrong?   Congratulations, CastleMiner Z, you haven't redeemed yourself one bit.
11011	There was a mentally ill person chasing me to sell me pills
11012	Maybe you should have put more time to make the game this before you put it in public.
11013	I cannot, nor will I ever come around to, recommend this game to anyone. In a nutshell, it's a blatant ripoff of Minecraft - and a bad one at that, considering hardly anything has been majorly altered to the point that it could be considered original in any way, shape, or form.
11014	Spawned, ran into a desert, saw some aliens, died. 11/10
11015	Not a very good game.
11016	Since the first day I bought this game, it crashes on me every 15 minutes.
11017	It's what you expect; A terrible Minecraft clone (i don't even like Minecraft that much)
11018	awful awful game not worth the money
11019	Too many zombies Bad graphics and why the hell are there dragons and the game crafting system looks like it was made in 1999. Basically a very cheap minecraft Should be Free
11020	If you really want to be in physical pain then buy this game
11021	This game is like the song Rude by magic, its a one hit wonder. You will buy it, play it for an hour or two for a laugh, realise how bad the animations and textures are, play for a bit longer. Then die about 100 times. You will then proceed to rage quit and never play it again. 10/10-IGN
11022	its ok.....Just a lil laggy so i refunded it
11023	This game is absolutely terrible and is nothing compared to the xbox version. If you like this game please tell me what drugs you've used recently because it's obviously had some affect on you.
11024	Terrible Graphics, Terrible Sound and overall Bad experience. -1337 tacos out of 20 Burritoes 
11025	The only good thing i can say is it's almost hilariously crappy.  Clearly not a finished game when things like there's no stab animation so you just wack them with your dagger. At $2 it's over-priced.
11026	one day i was polanin on goin to store and buy vbidya bu t io go to house an dg o computer cand bought cool vidya call miner zed i shot xmombi 3 milion. i saw a zombi slkkileton and shot 20 time in face and it di and i was like with mincefractt gut bguns but with possible mods ai dod not to 2 had but I told dad bouat it he toell me gay go ebd aI playedoi nthe toaster some more and it was really fun.   But seriously don't buy this â¥â¥â¥â¥in game it's a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥.
11027	Can not play it cause my guy keeps floating around and can't mine anything
11028	well, there are quite a few things that ruin this game,  1. when you die you lose everything except whats on your hotbar 2. you will mostlikely die a lot 3. mobs never stop spawning and if a dragon attacks you have to stay underground until you are prepared 4. if you want to survive for a long time you must sit in one spot and camp until you run out of ammo
11029	cant even save my game their no tutorails on how soo not worth my time
11030	Its a decent dollar game. If you haven't played it on the xbox 360, I would try this out if you can pick it up for $.99 (currently 3 or 4 dollars when I wrote this review). If you have played it on 360, there a few new things that were added such as respawn beacons and teleports (permanent ones) that could amuse you.  Originally, I was never going to buy this game on PC. I played extensively on 360 and even bought all the Digital DNA titles that gave perks for CMZ (basically $1 dlc) and made it around 20000 blocks or so from the start in Endurance (whatever they call the non-save mode) and didn't really want to go through the game again.   Then I saw the updates and things they added recently and thought, 'Hey, they did something with this finally. Maybe they are going to keep updating regularly.' Well, I'm not sure how much dedication is going into this as they currently have their project Savage Lands to work on (going really well actually, updates monthly give or take a week). But to finish my thought, those measly updates they pushed out with a few new blocks and a couple new items were not worth my repurchase of this game. Not to mention this is a really old engine, so even if there is a major update of CMZ it will probably be a new game.  There's very little replayability to this game once you beat the undead dragon (final boss) unless you help your friends through to beat him (which I did a few times). Typically the grind to getting the gear to beat the dragon then traveling out to the 4000 some distance to fight him takes 4ish hours by yourself and maybe an hour or 2 with friends. The fight can be difficult or overly easy. First time I fought the dragon, there were only bloodstone weapons in the game. I didn't succeed before one of the fireball vollies managed to kill me in my floating base. The next time I actually took the time to go out to kill the dragon in endurance mode was when the alien update was released. That time I used the Dragon Seeking Missiles to fight him and built my base on the ground out of space goo. Two missiles and I won. I went 'Oh, okay. Glad that wasn't a pain.' But any veteran of CMZ can tell you, once you fight one dragon, you've fought them all, so don't expect much.  So basically the game boils down to - Grind. March. Die. March. Die. March and finally make it. Die. March back by teleporting. Kill the undead dragon and then rarely, if ever, play again. But remember, this was (and still is) an Indie game! It is well worth a dollar. $1 That's about it though. 2-20 hours of play time.  
11031	its just..... bad. too bad for words. not worth the money at all, im glad i got it on sale
11032	buys the game downloads it and than starts it up suddenly castle miner z has stoped working.... I WANT MY 5$ BACK
11033	Afetr playing about 30 minutes of this travesty of a game, i came to the conclusion that if i were to play any further my brain would colapse on me. This is not a game its a glorified torture sesion. DOnt buy this game, buy it for your enemy that you would like to cause serious harm to:)
11034	I would rather walk on 1000000 lego bricks than play this horrible,unfair and stupid game made from the depths of hell and everything bad in this world.
11035	This game is not worth
11036	its terrible i cant even see the BLOODY GAME... how are u supposed to play it if u cant see it
11037	If I could be disappointed any faster than I did within entering this game, by all means this has attained that achievement. It has a 'this is my college game design project I molded right out of Minecraft' that leaves a bad taste in your mouth. It's clunky, doesn't make a lot of sense, looks like Resident Evil and Minecraft had an abortion halfway through development.  You're in danger upon entering, crafting anything is so task and time consuming, and the dragon, WHY DO YOU DO
11038	â¥â¥â¥â¥ING TERRIBLE DONT BUY THIS GAME ITS A WASTE OF MONEY!!!
11039	CastleminerZ on Steam I hate it because when I bought it I thought it would be the same as the Xbox 360 but no cause this â¥â¥â¥â¥ing piece of crap doesn't have Friends Only on Host Online or even theres no â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Kicking out or Pvp. This is gimiky â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t
11040	Played it for a couple of minutes with my friend. We both laughed about how bad it was. We turned it off and never played it again.
11041	Missing textures, invisible enemies, spawning in the sky, what is this..? I want my money back.
11042	Its garbage dont buy it eveyrthing is wrong its not worth 99 cents. 420 blaze it
11043	It's very buggy and poorly made, The animations are just horrible, The graphics are awful even for a simple block-based game. Even Roblox looks better. The worst part is that you have to buy the game. I mean atleast have it Free-to-Play and have Micro Transactions! You know what? no don't even make the game at all lets all just leave this pile of crap in the dust.
11044	This one of the worst payed games i have ever played its just a horrible,cheap copy of minecraft with some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ mobs and guns    1/5
11045	  -Spent $15   -Played an ugly, boring game for 5 hours.  -got bored  -got angry about wasted money  -never touched the boring, ugly game since.  I would reccomend that ANYONE having thoughts about buying this to take the $15 they have saved for it and THROW THE MONEY DIRECTLY INTO THE TRASH. It will be much more worth it than putting play time into this cumstain of a game. Trust me.
11046	Played for an hour and a half. Dragon kept killing me, and following me wherever i went. DONT BUY THIS GAME
11047	All people who did positive reviews were payed off   420/0  Gave my Grandparents terminal aids and my dad terminal testicular cancer  0/420   Most dissapointing game ever â¥â¥â¥â¥ing made
11048	This game will make your wallet beg for it's money back it is horrible.
11049	This game is buggy, laggy, and downright unbalanced, days are to short, stamina goes down within 2 seconds of sprinting. not to bother you all with speeches why its bad, there are other anons here that have already done that. i got this game from my anglo friend for free, i can only feel pitty for him for buying it, even though i got it for free, it still isnt a good game.   i cant recommend it with a sound mind.
11050	This is a pretty average game i don't see too much of a future in it its just not the kind of addicting game as all the others and just its not got enough in it
11051	This game had great potential. You could mine, craft, build, explore, and fight zombies and dragons, but thats where the makers stopped updating the game. I mean sure, its fun for the first few hours when you have nothing and have plans to get the best weapons the game has to offer, and the best base you can possably build, but once you do that it's pretty much go to the surface kill mobs, run out of ammo, make more ammo, and do it again. The developers abandoned this game to work on a new game which has recently been released. Upon completing that project they returned to CastleMinerZ to get new content out, but those ideas were brought to a halt when realizing the code was old and unable to be used. Recently they have been talking about a possable CastleMinerZ 2. So I would reccomend waiting to see if they decide to make that instead of wasting your money on this game.
11052	i dont like the game i want my money back
11053	like minecraft with garrys mod skins on the enemies and players. it plays poorly comared to the real thing tho. the concept is nice but i just couldnt get into it.
11054	this game is worse than mincraft.the graphics are terible and the guns stink
11055	This game is just a no. I honestly don't know how it has 'mostly positive'. This has to be one of the worse games I've played in a while. This game gets a good 0.5/5 from me. To be honest, I wouldn't even get the game if it was free. It is cluky, un organized, ugly and not really enjoyable. Playing with friends make it alright but it doesn't really help. The gameplay is just a mess in my opinion and kinda annoying.
11056	what a bag of â¥â¥â¥â¥
11057	This sucked so bad it hurt my eyes when i opened it.    0/100000000
11058	I've never noped out of a game so fast in my life. You cant even change your sensitivity from what I can tell.
11059	its boring  
11060	CastleMinerZ, This game i found it very fun to play, however, the devs put little effort into this game and the options are limited, i played this game with my friend and we had a lot of fun. CastleMinerZ is a fun game, but it is lacking many things.
11061	I loved playing this game. There is one problem which is that the game hasnt gotten an update since I joined the game. That was in 2014. Give the game a well deserved update and sure it will be fun.
11062	uhm, I came from the Xbox version of this game. The PC port is not what you will be expecting compared to the Xbox version.
11063	This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥...â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS GAME
11064	Started playing. Suddenly, Dragon! 'OH GOD WHAT DO I DO' I noticed my pistol. 'Oh.' Shot at em. Died. 1/10, dragons at start
11065	Absolutely the worst game I have played in years, filled with bugs that make the game unplayable. 0/10 do not buy even as a joke
11066	Alright where should I start? I was SO HAPPY when they posted that they will update it soon.............. 2 years 4 months 15 days later It only got an update that made me gag! It was like a rooster pooped on a sandwich with bananas that are full of spiders and Q-cumbers with rusty metal chunks. It used to be good but now... really.... Didgital BS... smelly fart... NOW THEY ARE CONSIDERING MAKING A SECOND ONE SO THEY CAN GET MORE MONEY INSTEAD OF JUST UPDATING THE FIRST ONE! THEIR EXUSE IS THE SOFTWARE IS OUT OF DATE! WHY DONT YOU JUST RESTART FROM SCRATCH AND JUST UPDATE EVERY THING FROM THE GROUND UP! LIKE A SECOND ONE EXEPT ITS THE SAME GAME! JEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Dont buy it... unless you want to wait 7 days to get your money back...              P.S. Sorry Papiwa.
11067	Absolutely terrible.
11068	I cannot express how terrible the gameplay is....you'll regret buying it. Trust me...go buy some CS:GO keys or something.
11069	This game is a mediocre Minecaft clone.  I bought this for myself and 2 other people. The first thing that happened when I played single player was me getting attacked by zombies endlessly. First things first, the zombies are horribly made. They jump like theyre on the moon and kill you in 2-3 hits, which is absurd in its own. Zombies also spawn randomly at random places, which is just frustrating in its own right. They also break blocks which makes creating a wooden house useless because its going to be molested and destroyed the first night anyway. Not to mention also that the health is just completely broken dispite it looking quite simple. If they were going to copy MC, why not just have hearts instead of a health bar that drains so damn quick. This wouldnt be a problem if armour was a thing. The early game guns are trash at best, and the late game ones I havent even gotten to try because every time I die due to the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ness of the early game guns my inventory clears and theres no way to recover it. It also annoys me how day is so short, but night is so long. When I first played I just learned the game and it was already night and me getting â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ in all my slots. It is also left out that the durability of tools in this game is non existent in the sense that pickaxes break after about 50 blocks broken and guns break after around 1500 bullets shot. The redeeming thing about this game is the multiplayer in which playing this game solo is frustrating to the point of cutting your â¥â¥â¥â¥ off with a meat cleaver.  6.5 / 10: Needs many updates to fix problems here listed, also not mentioning the countless other ones listed in other reviews.
11070	crafting is bad sensitivity is higher then having it maxed on cod and the npcs bow accuracy is so good you'd think there using aim bot   gamerating   1/4
11071	Cant play Multiplayer
11072	This game is booty meat. Don't buy it. The controls are bad and takes too much time to get used to. Don't know how to obtain certain resources. I don't think I'd get the game if it was free.
11073	oh my god this game is so bad the grafics are worst than minecraft the gameplay just minecraft evre idea is stolen from minecraft just with guns the multiplayer enter password joining get killed respond get killed respond get â¥â¥â¥â¥ing killed i whode have hope if it sayed in bada or in develient i give it a 2/10 a waste of 2.00$
11074	okay before we tear the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of this game lets actually be serious about this Review.  When i first bought this on the Xbox. I really enjoyed playing with my friends. I could never get really far but i really liked it.   But now when i actually play the game. I really realize how â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game is.  The only unique thing about this game is Bloodstone. Even that is just barely Unique.  This game sucks hands down
11075	Dont buy this game its just cheap and bad copy of minecraft.
11076	This game used to be a good game... Untill it got abandoned by the developers soooooooo yeah if you want a cheap, no longer living game. Then this is your game. and for only $2 as well so if you want something to do then here you go but don't expect any updates its been a year since the last update.  Update of the review.  So recently, this game was updated with some new features, the newest one is monster spawn blocks that spawn a bunch a enemies for rewards. Sounds kinda cool, but are basically pointless because: A. They're hard to find in normal modes. B. The loot is easily obtainable from different means like mining or even finding from an abandoned house in a random person's world. C. They're basically suicide when doing it alone and not geared up enough if you're a new player. Now there has been some good updates like a second hotbar to keep more important items in, teleporters, loot blocks and even windows. (Took them long enough for windows. XD) Although I'm going keep my orginal recommendation of this game as No, for there hasn't been an update that has blown my mind or got me hyped a lot. One thing that will change my recommendation of this game, will be something everyone has thought about: The Ability to change your character's apperance.  Long Story Short: Hoping for an update that gives different ways to change your character's apperance.
11077	First off i don't know if this is a problem with many but first thing i noticed is the mouse sense is ungodly high i had to set it to the lowest setting just to try and fight a zombie without turning into a ballerina and dieing.  Cons   - The sound effects are laughable  - Graphics are ugly (dust kick up effect dear god)  - Rather unbalanced gameplay monsters rip you apart  Pros  - The controls are rather nice (outside of the hyper mouse sense)  - Crafting is nice (better then what it used to be)   It's hard to say alot of good things or even bad things all of the problems are presented infront of you on a silver platter i wouldnt recommend this game unless you have a few friends to play it with and to watch you so you dont get ganged by a horde of zombies. 
11078	As someone who was a large supporter on Greenlight I admit I can't recommend it in it's current state. When I helped support the game I was supporting it for the potential. The developer still promises more content and has evidently been working on a rather large patch. If any update comes out that I feel makes this game fully worth your time I will update accordingly.  Also, if you are still going to get this game, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A FRIEND, it's practically unplayable solo.
11079	DON'T BUY THIS GAME EVEN WHEN IT'S ON SALE! -420/11 Would uninstall again!
11080	Anything that can make devs money, ANYTHING.  Castleminer Z is one of the most pointless video games in existence, I simply do not understand why this needs to exist. Castleminer Z is one of the millions of Minecraft clones out there that actually try new stuff but all of this is completely over shadowed by what the game is and is trying to be, a minecraft type survival game.  Cons A. You die way too quickly B. Graphics are complete â¥â¥â¥ C. The whole game looks like premade assets D. The world is not in any way interesting E. The enemies are generic and not at all original F. Very limited on what you can build G. Regenerating health (FFS) H. Almost all of the exact same â¥â¥â¥â¥ing minerals and ores as Minecraft I. Sensitivity is way too â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sensitive J. Game runs like absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥  Pros A. Its cheap B. It's not too complex C. Combat can be fun on occasion D. The only original thing they managed to do was add guns  If you're looking for a GOOD Minecraft type game, try Terraria instead of this â¥â¥â¥â¥.
11081	Spawned, -found a bunch of zombies -they kill me in 2 hits -they outrun me -I am desperate -tried once again -could not outrun them and hide -found some skeletons too -This game is garbage  -Don't waste your precious money, Minecraft is better.
11082	Messed up game, keeps crashing no matter what one do... Do not even bother buying it no matter how cheap it is.
11083	I would rather use a staple gun to staple a jaguar's paw to my right nut and masturbate furiously with barbed wire than play this game ever again.   This game is absolute garbage. Enemies are way to difficult and there is no way to negate their damage. Everything seems completely random. If you get hit, you sometimes can't run. If you activate a monster spawner, you sometimes get a reward.   Enemies are also generic. Zombies, skeletons, aliens and demons, and the demons are not killable. Ores are very basic and everywhere. Enemies can spawn at random at your feet, and will most likely kill you in two hits or jump around in such a sporatic manner that you cannot kill them.  This is by far the worst game I have ever played.  At least it has â¥â¥â¥â¥ing controller support. Oh wait, that is utter trash as well.

11085	Don't Do it. Resist the temptation. This is true shovelware, replete with bad design and shoddy sound. Watch the Total Biscuit WTF video on this game to get a good picture of in on youtube. 1/10- To be fair, just saw that a new patch was out today (yesterday really). I will update this after I try the new patch.
11086	An awful game, plain and simple.
11087	Pretending to play the game is more enjoyable than actually playing.
11088	If you like Minecraft, this game is for you.  The resembalances are errie. Looks almost exactly the same as Minecraft, if you have a high texture mod installed. Cool thing though, I managed to kill a dragon with a pistol. That thing was kind of ominous until I remember I was just messing around on creative.   Either way, not my kind of game.
11089	Feels very unfinished to me. Have had quite a few issues being able to play with friends. Would not recommend. If you want to play this go try Minecraft instead.
11090	  Thank you HappyDuckFace for the donation  This is possibly one of the hardest reviews I've done. There's a part of me that likes this game and there's a part of me that doesn't like this game. It is a rip off yes, but it has enough new ideas to reedeem itself of being a rip off. I'm probably cnfusing quite a few of you with this opening so I'll just get into the review.  Gameplay/playability  For those of you that haven't figure out the clown standing in front of you hnking his nose in front of you, this game is a minecraft rip off and it doesn't exactly seem too afraid to show that. Now you might be thinking that if it's a rip off, why not get minecraft. Well, there are a few things this game has over the original game it's ripping off. The most distinctive difference that everyone notices is that this game has guns that actually function well, unlike the guns that modders have been trying to put into Minecraft for years. CastleMiner Z also has challenge, like MineCraft did, but the thing is about this is that it sort of adds into the challeneg but it also takes some of the challenge out. The basic objective of Minecraft was to survive, gathering food, cook it in a stove while stocking up on coal, keeping your health high. Your main objective in MineCraft was to reach The End, defeat the Ender Dragon. In CastleMiner Z, hunger no longer applies, which already takes away half of the challenge MineCraft had and you might be saying 'They did this so it wasn't a complete rip off' I say 'They use the same block style of MineCraft, that's probably as obvious as an elephant trying to fit in at a mice gathering' CastleMiner Z takes that Ender Dragon boss battle at the end of MineCraft and places different dragons throughout the world you inhabit. You might be thinking that it's great to fight tons of dragons like the ender dragon tons fo times but I beg to differ. The thing that made the Ender Dragon boss battle good in MineCraft was because you could only do that once in your playthrough and you fealt really accomplished and triumphant when you defeated this dragon and destroyed all of it's crystals. With CastleMiner Z, it takes the lazy route to combat where there's no challenge and just blaze bullets out on the dragons and even though I fealt triumphant after beting my 1st dragon, it quickly wore off as I progressed. Another thing that makes me dislike CastleMiner Z over MineCraft is its objective. MineCraft had you go all over the place surviving, going to the nether and fighting the Ender Dragon. Now, with the basic premise of survival gone in CastleMiner Z (due to the lack of a hunger bar and regenerating helath) what does it do instead to keep the player entertained? Nothing. Without this premise, CastleMiner Z sort of feels pointless. It gives you the objective of moving North as far as you can but, it again doesn't show much challenge while throwing this weird objective at you. There are other game modes yes, but there are games that have pulled these game modes off better than CastleMiner Z did. I can easily understand why people might find these gamemodes fun but MineCraft was unique and CastleMiner Z tries to wrap up this weird deformed child of MineCraft and COD which isn't exactly a great combination, at least in my eyes. For people that enjoy this sort of concept, you will spend tons of time on this guaranteed, however if you're like me, you will get bored of this game quite quickly.  Graphics/Sound  The graphics is one of my main praises towards the game. I actually found CastleMiner Z really appealing to look at. It has this great tint to the blocky...blocks to make them have this blend of realism nd make them look like they belong there. If you don't believe me, take a look at the screenshots. The sounds to this game is a mixed bag. While the sounds to everything is good, they're inconsistant. The sounds that have been used for everything, doesn't sound like they belong in one place, it's sort of like if you get unity assets and then top them off with RPG maker assets and a blend of Unreal engine assets. While the sounds are fitting to what they have been designated to, none of these sound like they should fit together.  There are some really good ideas used in CastleMiner Z and underneath all of these issues I have talked about, there is definately a good game under here somewhere but I'm just not seeing it unearth yet.  Pros + Adds in new ideas to redeem it being a rip off + Cheap + Good graphics + Some will enjoy the gameplay  Cons - Boring gameplay - Useless objectives - Little to no challenge - Inconsistant sounds  Final verdict: 5/10  My Steam Curator group:  http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews   Help stop games like this getting through Greenlight by joining our Guardians of Greenlight group:  http://steamcommunity.com/groups/guardlight 
11091	This game is terrible, didnt even get to play much of it as no one was online and the 2 games that were online had passwords so couldnt join. I did however make my own game which didnt have much going on at all it seems like a minecraft rip off with guns and no building so in other words â¥â¥â¥â¥!   Avoid if you know whats good for you!
11092	Absolutely terrible. This game in all aspects are just complete crap. There is no variety in enemies, the gunplay is horrible (and yes for whatever reason there are guns in this minecraft rip-off), no original content (meaning that most of the games elements were stolen and slightly changed to make it seem as it's own). If I were you, I would not buy this crap of a game. It doesn't deserve a spot in Steam, and the fact that it's an Xbox Live port from years before Minecraft even came to Xbox Live to achieve money with a crap rip off. Stay away from it if you don't want to waste your time. For a more in depth review of this horrible game, look for the Cynical Brit's video on youtube titled 'âº WTF Is... - CastleMiner Z ?'.
11093	Poor performance, doesn't look nice, controls feel janky/wonky, little customization, just a port from console. Just get a zombie mod for Minecraft, you'll enjoy it much more.
11094	Don't Play This Game!  No really, don't even bother playing this terrible game that somehow got its ugly face on Steam. If you remember playing this game on Xbox 360, then this version will remind you at how lazy developers are these days not putting effort or innovation to their own game. Absolutely no new features are added to this version, besides the fact the 360 version already has these features. The graphics are still terrible in this day of age, the combat is abysmal, the enemies are basic as hell, and the core design of it is non existent!  If the developers actually put effort to this, maybe I would replay it. As it now, it is impossible to recommend this game in the state it is in. If you played any Minecraft clones before, then spend your money on Terraria instead of this trash!
11095	Played this game Twice and it never opened again, in the 2 times i played the game, it crashed...  10/10
11096	This Game is Minecrafts Mental Son
11097	actually crap
11098	Uninstall button was good
11099	 Base Gameplay
11100	Don't waste your money. This game has been on Steam for a while and has glitches that make it unplayable. Depending on what draw distance and graphics level combinations you use, different things will be invisible. Enemies, as far as I can tell, are always invisible. I had one go where my gun and knife were invisible and one where I could see the knife. I also had a combo that made EVERYTHING invisible.  Seriously, save your money. I played Castleminerz on Xbox and actually had a pretty good time. It's not a bad game, when it works. If you really like the way it looks, pick it up on Xbox. It's cheaper and it actually works. This port is absolutely unplayable and literally the worst port I've ever played. I've never had a game that was ported so badly I was literally unable to play it.  Like I said, the game has been on Steam for a good long while, so there is no excuse for these glitches.
11101	This game is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing disaster
11102	Unless you have at least 1 more person with you this game doesnt even worth playing

This port is absolutely unplayable and literally the worst port I've ever played. I've never had a game that was ported so badly I was literally unable to play it.  Like I said, the game has been on Steam for a good long while, so there is no excuse for these glitches.
11104	no updates, its not that difficult to listen, or have you might lost yourÃ¨ hearing? the people wants more updates!!
11105	Welp, it was good, me and my friend got bloodstone tools,diamons and all. Well, we left the world. The next morning we went to play it and it, just vanished. And the worst part was, this happend 2 times. How â¥â¥â¥â¥ing long is it before they fix this â¥â¥â¥â¥, until they fix this, i'll have to downvote this game.
11106	Playing this made me wanna poop, thanks Castleminer Z from saving my â¥â¥â¥ from constipation.
11107	i very much enjoyed the five minutes on the game getting the shiz out of me when i got jumped by a zombie
11108	This game was made to profit off of the community that liked Minecraft so much. The zombie's voices are ripped straight from Doom, so you will probably get sued by Bethesda for that, or at least I hope you do. This game is like someone tried to take Minecraft, Call of Duty, and the dragons from Skyrim into a big pile of crap and market it as '100% original content do not steal.' This game is not very good at all.
11109	It would be incorrect to say that CastleMiner Z is entirely just plagiarism, but âstrongly inspiredâ by Minecraft would be an overly fair description. You can add life to the world by engaging in multiplayer, but servers are limited to a mere eight players. The graphics is low for PC gamers but if youâre a smart phone user u might actually find this game interesting. So,i would reccommend this for the smart phone users only. :) 
11110	like minecraft but with aids
11111	Do not buy this garbage. Was fun on Xbox, but not on steam.
11112	Good idea, bad execution. Bad controls, TERRIBLE aiming, but slightly fun. PROTIP: Buy it here, and if you like it, get a refund and buy it on xbox. If you don't, get a refund.
11113	I decided it would be great fun to re-buy this game on PC (i remembered having fun on Xbox) Let's just say me and my 3 friends playing this game did not experience any such 'fun' business I'm not sure what i found entertaining about this game in the past and i would say it's only worth about Â£3.50 for the fourpack (i payed a lot more than that) This game really doesn't have much content to offer for anything more than an hour or two at best Stay away from this game because you can find much better games to play with friends (i would reccomend 100% orange juice)
11114	Please don't wate your money. This game is similar to minecraft but with guns and dragons and stuff. Sounds fun right? No!  The reason Minecraft is so great is its charm. Minecraft is a very nice looking game and this is just crap. The textures are bad, the crafting is confusing, and the game its self is just really frusterating.(not to metion bad.} If your attracted to this game because you like Minecraft, do yourself a favor, DON'T GET IT.
11115	...what is this?
11116	50 minutes in the game had a blast, fought monsters, destroyed dragons, built a bunch of small posts to remind me where I am coming from.  Then all of a sudden, bam. 'Error: steam may not be running'    No fix to be seen, I go high and slow, check dev posts, yet there seems to be no fix. Verifed the cache, reinstalled thrice.        Guess I'll be refunding.
11117	I hate my life.
11118	A cheap minecraft rip-off. So this game is minecraft with guns and it sucks. The hitboxes are absolutely terrible. The graphics try to be realistic but also blocky and it doesn't do either very well. The gunplay is bad, the enemies are all the same. And you can get the best gear in the game in 2 hours. Don't get this game.  3/10
11119	Some of the achievements are broken. In order to get achievements you have to be in Endurance mode. You are not allowed to save in endurance mode. Which means you can't make easy progress on the achievements. Other than the achievements I really dont feel like there is much to do.
11120	the mouse sensitivity is so high, and you cant change it. ruins the game.
11121	Worst minecraft clone you have ever seen! :D HAVE FaqING FUN!
11122	Game crashes 24/7
11123	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-Bp34RXWm4&amp;t=316s 
11124	There are certain games that take inspirations and ideas presented in other games and use them to create new and interesting experiences that in their new form have considerable merit. And then there are games that make it appear that the developer isn't even trying or just attempting to cash in on an idea that is immensely popular at the moment. CastleMiner Z is an example of the latter.  A gathering and crafting game with a focus on making guns to combat the undead in a procedurally generated voxel-based world, CastleMiner Z feels like it is trying to combine Minecraft and Day Z, but fails to properly capture the essence of either. As a zombie game, CMZ will frustrate you with unpredictable and seeminly overpowered zombies that will kill you without warning and cause you to lose your inventory. As an exploration game, CMZ will feel repetitive through it's lack of variety in enemies and otherwise barren environments. And as a creative game, CMZ horribly fails since the only thing you can build are guns, ammunition, metal blocks, doors and lights.  That is not to say the game is completely bad. The graphics are pretty decent, the crafting system is very intuitive thanks to the menu interface, and it has a strong focus on guns. But if you are looking for a deep experience where you make your own progression through better gear with the creation of an architectural masterpiece on the side, you will not find it here. The game admittedly is very low priced, but as they say, you get what you pay for. If you're looking for a really good voxel-based game that allows for actual creative options and is on Steam, I would recommend Block Story instead.
11125	Intersting game. Great graphics. Intense atmosphere.   Little or no content, other than building walls and shooting things. Needs more. Also there are bugs which make gameplay infuriating. You can't save the game, even in solo offline mode. Which means when one of the bugs kills you, you've lost hours of work.   I can't recommend this game at this time, but it has a lot of potential. Right now it's more of an Alpha.
11126	Gave me cancer. 10/10 would chemo again
11127	Worst i probaly have in my libary right now  Pros -Barely Anything Cons -Animations are just horrific to look at -Community is the worst online -Badly generated terrain -Misleading and False advertising  -One of the worst PC graphical options and UI i've seeen -The models are just terrible to look at -The sounds are one of the worst I would NOT recommend this game
11128	Game was $15 Ok i liked it on xbox Buys it Nevermind its so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Several months pass Notice it is now $2 I want my $13 back 
11129	The game frequently crashes. Have optimised graphics but still crashes.
11130	Absolutely broken because the game crashes every 20 - 30 minutes.
11131	This game sucks on PC, would be way better with modding support and much more content added into the game: Such as more enemies; better movement features (crouching, going prone, different movement speeds etc); bigger selection of items and more.
11132	this game was terrible
11133	This game runs like skyrim but looks like minecraft and plays like glitchy call of duty save you're money...
11134	I'm going to punch my friend in the face for gifting me this.  Or should I give him Bad Rats?
11135	Fun ripoff of minecraft.  I guess its a funlittle game you can play but you can spend your money on a much better game than this.  4/10
11136	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Graphic, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Ripoff. Less options, Less fun.
11137	This gaME IS TERRIBLE! The problem is whenever i make a new map or load an old map it will just have an empty world like no ground surface but just floating in the air!
11138	It's okay I guess.
11139	it cant update because of a disk read error if i cant fix it i want my $4 back
11140	Okay at first I though this was going to be a fun little shooter/minecraft game... I quickly found out it's way to easy to play after you get your first real gun. was fun for a bit... I would play more of this IF they were to ever update again it seems like there is so much content that's missing though honestly i think they just released it and said screw it and ran off with all that money.   This is a dead game, do not buy it they have not and will not update this game again... pretty sure of that after over a year of no updates or information just don't buy it.
11141	This game is super glitchy, a dragon came on the first night and zombies were constantly spawning. My knife and all my bullets and my pickaxe ran out in the first 10 minutes becuase i was fighting zombies. Sometimes if you punch a zombie to death it will disapear to everyone except for the person it's fighting, it will then kill the person he was fighting and is invincible.  Building a base is useless as dragons destroy it by flying over it and zombies spawn inside of it.   Good stuff- an uninstall button. it's this great thing that removes the game from my life! i loved it! 10/10 for uninstall button -10/1000 for game. I got this game as a gift and i still regret it.
11142	why
11143	Okay at first I though this was going to be a fun little shooter/minecraft game... I quickly found out it's way to easy to play after you get your first real gun. was fun for a bit... I would play more of this IF they were to ever update again it seems like there is so much content that's missing though honestly i think they just released it and said screw it and ran off with all that money.

11144	It's just terrible.
11145	  this is just minecraft but more features that suck
11146	It's just terrible.
11147	  this is just minecraft but more features that suck
11148	First of all I do not recommend this game too anyone because you can't change your rez. so your stuck at this rez. that you can't change and that is horrible plus the sound effects and the controls and the grapics are all bad too do not get this game!!!!
11149	The game looked semi interesting because it is a voxel-based game similar to Minecraft, but with guns and dragon attacks. After playing for about 10 min or so, I experienced constant crashes of the game no matter what settings I change it to. I have a Lenovo Windows 8 64-bit laptop so this shouldn't happen constantly with this low quality type game.  I wish I could get at least a partial refund for this.  Also, I play COD: Black Ops 2 and Left 4 Dead 2 all the time with out any crash issues. The problem is not my computer, it is the game.
11150	It's fine not the best game i have ever played but it shuts down every 10 min on me
11151	My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.' Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.
11152	This game is crap, if a zombie hits you, your gona die because you slow down, zombies do way too much damage, if your hiding in your house, about 100 zombies will crowd outside and you cant get out without dying.
11153	I bought the game to write a negitve review
11154	My dumbass friend bought me this game, now i want to drown him in a pool of lye.
11155	I loved uninstalling this game.  Bad clone of Minecraft, no tutorials to start with, creative mode is not even creative, ANOTHER zombie game, like if we don't have enough of these... Ugly graphics even in the best quality settings... The aim down sights which changes nothing more than the view... Seriously, this is a bad game and I don't recommend you buying this.
11156	This game changed my life forever. The pure and beautiful design makes a wonderful world. Driven by a powerful engine, designed by probably the best people out there. The gameplay is som rich in content and details. It amazes me how someone could even be able to come up with something like this.   Shortly said. This game is like minecraft and Country Justice: Revenge of the Rednecks had a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ baby, which they choose to throw in a cave where they dump radioactive waste. If someone ever managed to find that baby.. they would find this.
11157	I would rather get big mac with a medium cola other than buying this game agein but on PC whoo!  -The graphics look the same -don't look like your avatar +'deicent' controls -when you get laser weapons there's nothing to do -don't gain achivments in survival -'cheap AI' e.g spawn and come from the underground and infiltrare your base by that. NOT WORTH A BUY JUST GET THE XBOX 360 VERSION ITS BETTER!
11158	The game is a good time waster, but is up with the 'Ran out of memory' issue. I was in the middle of a 2 hour build in 'Creative' mode and now its all gone because apparently my 16GB machine was drained from all its memory from this game.
11159	So bad i got cancer just by playing it ...
11160	Pretty average game. Still Beta maybe even Alpha in state. Hasnt been updated for last 6 months on PC. Think this one is dead in the water.
11161	  Strange controls, kind of buggy, and a Minecraft/7 Days to Die ripoff
11162	rather play agar.io for 48 hours straight than this for 2 hours 
11163	For a game developed by mostly just 3 guys, it was pretty fun. I expected the people there to develop it for PC but that was back in 2012. now this game has gotten such bad reviews, and I tell ya, they didn't convert ANYTHING to the PC format, they just gave the XBLA version a tweak so it'd work on PC...Anyway if you can get past the not being able to edit the controls/graphic, or even resolution, (which is really hard to look beyond) you'll see that the game is OK for it's genre.
11164	Downloaded, got a virus.
11165	it's a lousy minecraft clone go play minecraft instead  at least minecraft is decent, I suppose
11166	Boring BORING BORING BORING!!!  Make it look cool in intro and all that, but I CANT EVEN HAVE FUN! Maybe cause I have low fps, but without that it still is really boring. Only fun is when you play with 1 or 2 people, but if you don't have anybody to play with... WELL TOO BAD. I didn't look if you can play with random people, but even if you can, why would you?  10/10 Would never play again.
11167	This game literally ruined my life. But it's so â¥â¥â¥â¥.
11168	Was fun for the 0.2 hours I played with friends, but there's no actual content other than a minecraft ripoff
11169	The graphics is on the unfortunate side of the uncanny valley. Crafting UI is ridiculus -- maybe for a controller, but definitely not for mouse. Dust when digging make you can't see anything. Not even for 2 dollars.
11170	waste of money creative dosent work controls are horriable even with no senstivity on. and the modes dont work i woudent reckamend you waste 2.00 $ on this game is horriable. honest
11171	Damn I buy this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game for 5$ and now it is 2 dollars? Its not even good what the â¥â¥â¥â¥, wheres my refund gaben!
11172	Hasn't had an update in a year, game has a dumb delay from mouse to screen, no matter how good your pc is, and loading the world always causes lag spikes no matter how good your pc is, it is just a DayZ Minecraft Ripoff, but worse than both, might as well stick to minecraft and get a gun mod.
11173	i cant get the game to work i start it up and my screen goes black.
11174	probably the biggest MEH on my list , not really to bad i guess but i could probably find more entertainment smoking crack down town playing jenga with some big â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ named bubbah
11175	Just terrible. Absalutly terrible.
11176	I extremely recommend this game to people who enjoyed minecraft, or any zombie game, or building game. It takes an interesting mind to combine zombies, dragons, demons, and building things like minecraft! I have found this game fun on its own, but its even more fun with a friend or too. so if you really want to enjoy it, make sure a friend picks it up too. *EDIT I need to mention, they changed the way the game's UI, I mean they overhauled it so much, and its strange and they removed host opitions, and if its there, then it is so far impossible to access. Only reccomend this if you have played the Xbox 360 verison and really want to play this game, it is better with friends, still. Not really.
11177	It's like every voxel based construction game out there, but horrible.
11178	On easy, this game is TOO easy, but on anything but easy, it's extremely difficult to encounter a zombie and actually stay alive. Aside from that, there's no real point to the game but building weapons to protect yourself from the massive amount of very fast zombies, not to mention the dragon.
11179	its ok for the money to be fair even if it is quickly mind numbing will stick to mincraft i think
11180	So I bought CastleMinerZ in the early 2014s thinking 'Hey I have played this game on xbox and it was fun so I should get it on the computer.' I played for 1 hour and after that hour got up and deleted it off my desktop and walked away. One day I was bored and redownloaded this game and decided to give this game 1 hour to prove it's worth of 5 dollars. I sat down watched it download and pressed play. Lets just start off by saying I play CSGO, in CSGO I have my sensitivity at around 1.30-1.40. This game dosen't let you change your sensitivity at all. I'm basicly walking around while my mouse goes zooming around my screen at the slightest of movement. Don't even get me started on the nasty sounds or the hardcore amounts of damage you take along with the insane HP regen. The game is basicly a damn port from the xbox but somehow is WORSE than the xbox version. To conclude instead of giving this game 1 hour of my time I gave it 5 minutes and clicked EXIT. I guess for 5 dollars you can't go wrong but still its a waste.
11181	Please, do not buy this. Even if it is on sale for a dollar, please, don't get it. If you desperately need to know how bad it is for yourself, you can just get it for free through totally safe and legal methods that for sure do not involve using things like a pirates bay.  Wait, don't even do that. F**k this game.
11182	a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game thats only fun with friends.
11183	What the â¥â¥â¥â¥.  Really smooth animations and graphics, stunning gameplay and models- clearly designed by a well trained gaming company. I see a great future for the down syndrome ape that made this game. DONT BUY THIS
11184	Damn this game is 69% positive please make it drop lower.
11185	Pros: none  Cons: I actually paid $4 for this
11186	This game is amazing! Theres only 1 thing missing though... there is no option to kill yourself.... in real life
11187	I hacked the game ahahahhahaha â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game is great but i love hacking itttttt!!!!!!!
11188	The concept of this game is brilliant. Unfortunately, the same can't be said about the execution.   Sound design, quality, physics, enemies - just about anything that makes or breaks a game, you can bet your bottom dollar that this game messed it up!  Half the time, all of the blocks in the world are entirely transparent! In fact, this game is so bad that it's not even worth going through all the problems with it, please, for your own sake - stay well away from this game.  This game is the definition of a bad Minecraft clone.  Seriously, steer clear of this game.
11189	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
11190	game sucks dong
11191	This game is OK but i think the Devs have given up on it, so i would recommend waiting until some major improvements come through 
11192	keeps on crashing when i do play it does running then it stops...
11193	first this game lacks story,gameplay,combat, all ai, open world system is â¥â¥â¥â¥   secondly this game costs to much, i payed $2 for a game, that game was like taking a â¥â¥â¥â¥ eating it pukeing it back up and then eating it again that is what the game is like.
11194	A friend gifted me a copy of this because he got a 4 pack for pretty cheap, but it only took us about 10 minutes to realize that this game is total garbage. It's buggy, clunky, unpolished, and not worth your time.
11195	This is just a terrible console port of-at BEST- an average game,I have played a fair amount of the Xbox 360 version and that was better than this. At least your character on the Xbox version had customization options, in this all you get is a bony(whatever, I probally misspelled it) anorexic... um, thing? The sensitivity with ironsights is LOW, you have to aim straight at what you shoot. The zombie 'moans' are more like-this is just an attempt to text the sound- RRRRRRRRRRRRRRUUUUUU and just annoyingly loud, your attacks feel like they never hit due to NO BLOOD to indicate you hit it-if you don't use blood, use a hit-marker on the HUD. TL;DR Terrible port of an average game.
11196	Ho boy. THIS GAME. Now, I'll admit, this game was fun for about 10 minutes. Then it got boring. And it lies forgotten in my library....... I coulda spent those 2 dollars on the Steam Market....
11197	HOW THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ IS THIS NOT CONSIDERED COPYRIGHT STEALING? seriously....this game is like modded minecraft with texture pack! there are most things minecraft has but with changed.... names for example there is nether but is hell or something...i dont know and the blocks which are almost like netherack from minecraft are called blood rock or something like WTF! i played the game for like 5 minutes only to make a review and warn others NOT TO BUY  i knew this game was bad but they were 2 bucks s why not.THIS SHOULD BE FREE OR BETTER THEY SHOULD PAY YOUT TO PLAY THIS PIECE OF â¥â¥â¥â¥.The devs are making a new game,savage lands,good luck at their development but something tells me it would the same garbage with this game!  EDIT:Yeah, my review is very abusing and it was kinda stupid i know.I had some presonall problems and what a better way to get on with them than to abuse games in a review.im keeping the review the same with this small addition cause i â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up hard and its stupid to just erase such bad behavior with a button. anyways the game is still bad in my opinion but it doesnt deserve this hate i gave it
11198	I played for like 10 mins and relized this game is crap. please dont buy it
11199	â¥â¥â¥â¥
11200	what
11201	I got this game thinking it was going to be a good port,  Boy, was I wrong.  I wanted to get this game because (Being Austrailian) I couldn't get the Xbox360 version. Honestly, I shoulda got it on sale. Instead of confusing you, (and the fact that I'm lazy) I'll just write a pros-cons list.  Right, lets go...  Pros -Non-Toxic community, mostly. -Fun with friends. -Fun at times.  Cons -â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ options. -Bad textures. -It's boring alone. -Usless updates. -Terrible devs.  Right, don't buy it unless it's on 75% off. Seriously, Don't.
11202	For 2 dollars, sure why not. But if you're looking to actually play this game, go buy minecraft!
11203	I bought the game and played it for awhile and it was alright. Now i cant even play it, it just auto attacks whenever i get into the game and i cant do anything.
11204	it keeps kicking me out of the game like every minute.
11205	good game! play it for lots of fun! 
11206	Game of the year.
11207	This game is a completionist's hell. The game's achievements beg you to play for hours at a time without a save option. It is annoying to have to invest into a game that doesn't give a damn to players who just want a block survival game. The very little motivation you get from the achievements is crushed by the fact that you must play on the punishing gametype 'Endurance' which takes a large amount of fun out of the game and makes it feel like a grind with no checkpoints. There are few redeeming qualities of the game that are drowned out by its difficulty. (Not even going to mention how awful it is in single player) This, in conclusion, is a poor mans Minecraft, and if I were you, I'd just save my piggy bank for Notch himself.
11208	My OLD friend bought me this.. Hes old to me bacause I havent talked to him since.. Terrible game, DO NOT BUY! UNless you want them to not talk to you for the rest of ever ;D
11209	The game keeps crashing every 10 mins. The only thing that kept me playing this was my crew.
11210	this game is just not good
11211	ummm how about no....
11212	â¥â¥â¥â¥ 
11213	Not even worth $0.99 on sale. Do not buy this crappy game unless your 5 years old, then you might like this.
11214	Like Call of Duty with blocks
11215	Ehhh... as part of a bundle sure. Not as bad as I thought it would be but still not something I would really recommend.
11216	Check out the video below for full detail!:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwZvIaQyjXY&amp;list=PLytCO5xqmu5BjSpszXtkDJnA-BXSz3FM_&amp;index=8   One of the worst indie games I have ever played!
11217	Love it but SCREW THE DRAGONS 
11218	this whole game looks like a 3 year old tried to make their own version of minecraft.
11219	this game is tarible and the grafics are BAD
11220	Game is unfinished trash. Boring gameplay, awful enemy AI, and very minimal graphics. The game looks like it was made in 2000.
11221	Love it but SCREW THE DRAGONS 
11222	i can't believe that this is a real game for sale on steam dot com  the zombies in this game are the most athletic zombies i've ever seen  your arms look like noodles  there's a dragon (?)  don't buy this game for yourself  don't buy it for your friends  literally buy anything else  please  for my sake
11223	9/11-ign crashed a dragon into a set of towers flew straight through worst 9/11 simulator disrespecting our muslim culture
11224	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game, this game will abort your child
11225	literally a piece of garbage
11226	Well I played it for about 20 minutes. Within those 20 minutes I dealt with horrible graphical options, that weren't formated properly by the way, an occasional white screen that occured when turning, and an out of memory error on a 8gb system with the game apparently not capable of using more than 500mb.  Also it runs pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and just isn't fun. Glad I got this for free, otherwise it'd probably be the worst $5 I ever spent.
11227	I would not recomend this game unless its freaking 2025. This game is very bad, minecraft was better because it has more content, is more simplier and easier. Castleminer Z is a insanely bad copy of minecraft its not even close to the amount of content minecraft has, it has no variety in gameplay, bad jerky mouse sensitivity and outright horrible gameplay for begginers.
11228	It says 19 hours because the game wouldn't close. Not only that, this game is a disgusting knock-off of Minecraft, with clunky controls, and enemies that will NOT let back. Don't waste your money on this.
11229	IF YOU WANT TO BUY A GIANT TURD THEN BUY THIS GAME!
11230	Guys, it's not Meinecraff, it's just a game created by â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ on the keyboard.
11231	super laggy and sucks
11232	paly get everything pay people with diamonds to build base got bored unistalled
11233	It sucks.
11234	Made me want a Refund  11/10
11235	My computer died because there's so many dust particles from mining blocks, it clogged up my computer.
11236	One of the best games of this century, literally I love this game. The graphics and story are better than any game I've ever played. If any of you disagree then I hate you. Even the title is inspiring, Bethesda, Valve, Gearbox, Rockstar, and Treyarc stole from this game.
11237	Sucks.. Wasted money for this piece of shiitt..
11238	â¥â¥â¥â¥
11239	WTF is this game ?
11240	Sucked so bad, a poor excuse of a sandbox game.
11241	i have got castleminer z but it will not open :L
11242	This gaem sux m8 since it doesn't make the blox and the weapons m8. not gr8 m8 i r8 0/8
11243	This game seems unfinished.
11244	Game was â¥â¥â¥
11245	  I got this game for free from a friend since my other great friend cried about getting this game since we played it on the xbox 360. The game wasnt good back then. As a matter of fact i believe its more broken now. The glitch i saw five years ago when zombies would bend down to eat bodies they would dissapear. That still happens in 2016. This game give you 0 chance to do anything. This game was horrible and it still is. I told him he was blinded by the past. Its horrible, Its â¥â¥â¥, Not even worth it when free. This game is trash. Dont get it.
11246	lmao this's â¥â¥â¥â¥ing unreal â¥â¥â¥â¥
11247	worst game ever it starts up right and like 30 second later it crash and it still on well you can here the song dont get this game until they patch this or if your on windows 7 then dont get it
11248	When I first bought this, I thought this game was good. They haven't optimized much. I used to play this on a Dell Studio Slim 540s at almost MAX. She was a pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥ computer for what she was. Now I use a Toshiba Satellite C55-B5300, which is more powerful. Suddenly, one update broke game sensitivty and made it lag like all hell.
11249	Confusing.
11250	young kid tried to make me rage quit after he stole my stuff       this game is only worth it if you want to play it a couple times with a friend because it not good
11251	Absolute crap, I would honestly rather die of a stroke while taking a dump than play this game.
11252	It sucks 
11253	When I said that I'm going to play this game to a friend, he told me to kill myself. Turns out I didn't need to, as this game gave me cancer anyway.
11254	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  Its only purpose was to make a clone of Minecraft before one was avalible on X-box Live. If you think this game is good then just mod Minecraft to have guns and a harder survival mode. You can barely do anything in the game before a zombie 2-shots you and you lose everything in your inventory. The game is summed up by saying it is a cash grab that feels like a 7 year old thought of the mechanics.  If you like Minecraft, then play that instead. If you hate Minecraft, don't worry you will hate this too. If you look at the game and think, 'wow that is a cool idea I would love to play Minecraft with guns and dragons in a more mature setting' like I first did you will soon notice that the game is not even trying to hide the fact it is a X-box port because around each corner it shows you the controls for the X-box.   THERE ARE NO REDEEMING QUALITIES OF THIS GAME. It is just an excuse to make a clone of Minecraft. The developers just threw cool stuff together before Minecraft was on X-box and there is NO REASON to port this over to a system that has the original Minecraft already!  GOOD DAY SIR!
11255	It's a great way to make sure your uninstall button is working.
11256	This is how much Minecraft should cost. 3.99. They're out of their minds to sell it for more. Castleminer Z is like the decent version of Minecraft considering it's price and what you get.
11257	NOT WORTH IT AT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
11258	The only reason I don't recommend this game is that it has been seemingly abandoned by the creators and has very little content. However, it has potential, so hopefully the creators will come back to it.
11259	this game is so bad i would rather castrate myself with a rusty kitchen knife than play it
11260	I cANT SHARE IT WITH MY FRIENDS BUT OTHERWISE ITS GREAT!
11261	When I look at this game, I think the meeting for the concept of the game went down like this: 'HEY BOB, THE KIDS SEEM TO BE INTO THIS...UH...MINECRAFT THING, IT ISN'T ON CONSOLES YET.' 'THEN HOW ABOUT WE MAKEA CHEAP KNOCKOFF OF IT FOR CONSOLES, TIM?' 'OR BETTER YET,BOB, RIGHT BEFORE IT RELEASES ON CONSOLES?!' 'GREAT IDEA TIM! YOU'VE EARNED A PROMOTION'  So...after that, heres my opinion.  Castleminer Z was a originally a console game, before being ported to PC. I have played it on consoles, and it hasn't changed much between ports.  It was apparently released the same time as the Minecraft console ports, which makes it worse.  The game in itself is enjoyable, to an extent.It hasn't got NEARLY as much secrets or variety as the thing it's knocking off.And even though I'm not really bothered by graphics, for a 2011 game (same year as skyrim released) IT LOOKS LIKE IT COULD RUN ON WINDOWS 98.  Pretty sure the enemies would suit an N64 game. But I'm also pretty sure the zombie model has been used in other games, so this game most likey uses Unity Engine assets.   They even made a verson called CastleMiner that's just creative. They probably made the 2 versions to make more money from you buying them, though CastleMiner doesn't seem to be on steam...hmmm.  I give the game: 1 kick in the nuts followed by watching your entire family being tortured to death while on fire/10  P.S: the current price of under Â£1 seems too high for a piece of sh*t like this, it's worth about a penny.
11262	why the hell do i have this game
11263	Don't get me wrong this game is fun if you play with friends, but after a few hours of playing together it does get boring. I guess if you really want to get this game get the 4-pack when its on sale.
11264	Mincraft clone.
11265	Feels like a typical console port, Sensitivty in this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ better with controller, Enemys spawn right on your â¥â¥â¥â¥ing base with or without torches we built a castle zombies just spawned right on the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing wall. I do enjoy the game with freinds but honestly it feels kinda cheap in a way. Still a cool game but it needs a little work especially with the spawning on base I would really like that preticular problem to be adressed. I would love to give this a thumbs up but that one problem honestly ruined it for me. I got it for a doller.
11266	This game is a strong OKAY in my opinion. It has one upside: guns. Everything else feels like they ripped this game straight from minecraft, given a literal spray paint job.
11267	Don't get me wrong this game is fun if you play with friends, but after a few hours of playing together it does get boring. I guess if you really want to get this game get the 4-pack when its on sale.
11268	Just another plain, not that good game
11269	Game is alright but i really want to change the field of view and the game crashes every 15 minutes. Other than that its alright and worth the price
11270	Well, first thing I want to say is I am a huge DigitalDNA fanboy. I love all of their games on the Xbox 360, and I hope that they respond to this review to give me some kind information. I'll begin my review by saying, resolution is a problem. DNA needs to add changing resolution and meaningful graphics settings to make the game playable for more PC gamers. I personally can not give much information about the gameplay, seeing as I can not play the game with it's current graphics, but from the laggy walkthrough I did, it seems pretty similar to the Xbox 360 version. When they update the graphics settings and add changing resolution, I will definitely bump up my review, but until then, I'm one dissapointed fanboy. :(
11271	(æ¥æ¬èªã¬ãã¥ã¼ã¯ä¸ã®ã»ã)  Gameplay is repetitive : - Having no food, water and anything to look out for 'Survival'. Health regenerates, as well too easy to survive. - Due to attack/dig speed, you always lose tools' durability more than you should. Irratiating on lower level tools. - Crafting is simple, with no 'worktable/workshops' and you can craft anything as long as you carry materials. But it's hard to navigate and you always have to run through the big crafting list.  Graphic and sounds are poor. Minecraft's 'Box style' had its own beauty and unity but CastleMinerZ doesn't.  Horrid Japanese Translation and not being able to change languages.   Multiplayer stucks on 'Connecting... Please Wait...' phase.  1/10, Don't get it unless it's on a bundle. or play on Xbox360. There are countless sandbox games that are better than this.  The Good : - Japanese translation is so bad, that it got my laugh for seconds The Bad : - Uninspiring Minecraft-cloned 'Survival Sandbox' - Not much stuffs to do, other than to dig, fight and craft. - translation is so bad, that I wish I could change language to English, or work on them BY MYSELF(And I wouldn't do it for free in this case, if I were called).  ---------------------  ã²ã¼ã ãã¬ã¤ã¯ã¨ã«ããåèª¿ã: - ãµãã¤ãã«ã¨éæã¡ãªããé£æãæ°´åãªã©ã®æ¦å¿µãç¡ããããã«ã¹ãèªç¶åå¾©ããã - æ¡æ/æ»æéåº¦ã®åé¡ä¸ãå¿è¦ä»¥ä¸ã«ãã¼ã«ãæ¶èãã¦ãã¾ããMinecraftã¯ãã­ãã¯ãæ¡æãã/æµãæ»æãããã³ã«æ¶è²»ã ãããã¡ãã¯ãã­ãã¯ãæ®´ãã ãã§æ¶è²»ããã - ã¯ã©ããã¯ã¯ã¼ã¯ãã³ãã®ãªãã·ã³ãã«ãªãã®ã§ä½ã§ãä½ããããé·ããªã¹ãããã¡ãã¡ã¹ã¯ã­ã¼ã«ããã®ãé¢åã  ã°ã©ãã£ãã¯ã¨ãµã¦ã³ãã¯æ®å¿µãªåºæ¥ãMinecraftã¯ãã®è¦ãç®ã®çµ±ä¸æããã£ã¦ããã£ãã®ã«ã  æ¥æ¬èªã®è¨³ãã²ã©ãããæ©æ¢°ç¿»è¨³ã ããè¨èªè¨­å®ãå¤æ´ã§ããªãã Leaves(è) &gt; éåºãStrafe(æ¨ªç§»åãFPSç¨èª) &gt; çºå°ããã¼ãã«ã®èª¬æã«ããã©ã³ã´ãã¨è¨ãèª¤å­ãªã©ã  ãã«ãã¯ã¤ãªãããªããããæ¥ç¶ä¸­...ããã­ã£ã³ã»ã«ãããã¿ã³/ã­ã¼ããªãã  1/10ããã³ãã«ã«å¥ã£ã¦ãªããè²·ãä¾¡å¤ã¯ç¡ããã¾ãã¯ç®±âã§ãã£ãã»ãããã·ãPCãªããã£ã¨è¯ããµã³ãããã¯ã¹ã²ã¼ãæ²¢å±±ããã  è¯ãã¨ã : - ãã¾ãã«ãé·ãæ¥æ¬èªè¨³ã§ç¬ãã æªãã¨ã : - Minecraftå£åãã¯ãªã®ããµãã¤ãã«ã - æ¦éãæ¡æãã¯ã©ããä»¥å¤ã«ãããã¨ããªã - ãã¾ãã«ãé·ãæ¥æ¬èªè¨³ã§ãè±èªè¨­å®ã§ããããã£ããã¾ãã¯éãè²°ãããªãç§ãç¿»è¨³ãããã£ãã
11272	I got this game for free. That's a relief. I enjoy it, but it's buggy and unfinished. I don't see anything happening to improve the development. Avoid it. Another reviewer mentioned he would rather drag his private bits through 70 miles of ground glass or something like that. I thought he was going easy on the developers. The LAN play isn't even properly implemented. You host a server, everyone can join. If you switch it to friends only, nobody can join and you can't even invite them... at least that was my experience. As a Minecraft mod, it would have maybe been okay. As a standalone, it's worthless.
11273	One of the worst unfinished game. Maybe fun in multiplayer for 3-4 hours, but that is all.
11274	I bought this game as a joke and to make fun of it, I was still disapointed.
11275	Worst game ive ever played after playing this game i wanted to kill myself for how bad it is -99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999/10
11276	  Arguably one of the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥est games ever made. It seems that, in their rush to cash out on the Minecraft and Call of Duty trends, they forgot to add any content whatsoever other than different coloured guns. Even among the 'Minecraft Ripoff' genre it is unremarkable as games like fortress craft and Total Miner have more content and are more fun.  However, it's a bit of fun to play with friends while you all laugh at the game's utter incompetence. I would rate it a 3/10 because it's terrible. 
11277	Don't believe any of the positive reviews, period. This game attempts to take multiple popular franchises and mash them together into some horrible abomination of a 'game'. The characters look like they're ripped from a Nintendo 64 shooter, the landscape is what you'd expect from a mobile phone Minecraft ripoff, and the enemies look far worse than the House of the Dead shooter that has been around since 1996. If someone got this game for you, they're trolling you. If you bought this game for yourself, no matter what sale it was on, you trolled yourself. I played this game as a test of irony with a friend and I can confidently say we saw all of the content within 2 hours of playtime.
11278	How did these even make it on Steam
11279	In the criminal justice system, sexually-based offenses are considered especially heinous. In New York City, the dedicated detectives who investigate these vicious felonies are members of an elite squad known as the Special Victims Unit. These are their stories.
11280	This game is Minecraft for poor people + Spooky scary skeleton mod   Me&gt; This game is minecraft for poor people guy1&gt; LMAO guy2&gt; lol 12 minutes later.... Guy1&gt; can i get some wood? me&gt; my side chick will hook you up guy4&gt; db4ks your one of those people... me&gt; Black people? guy4&gt; No, Immature guys me&gt; Dead.
11281	This game sucks and is laggy and the online is horible.
11282	Best part about this game? the uninstall button
11283	kill me, please for the love of god kill me
11284	Literally just a modded version of minecraft. Except the mod should be called â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game simulator. with â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ier grahics and horrible gameplay.  The only gameplay this game has to offer is shooting zombies everywhere in a randomly generated map, and the resource gathering part of the game is complete â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t because of how easy it is just to get the best materials in the game and become insanely OP after just 5+ mins of digging. Then you can go on for a million waves and eventually come across these dragons that are just as OP as you are, but this time there is 500 of them and 1 of you. Literally 1 dragon could tear down a whole base made up of the best block in the game imaginable, making it impossible to `adapt` because of the huge â¥â¥â¥â¥ing difficulty gap. The graphics are comeplete â¥â¥â¥â¥. The zombies look like they came from grand theft auto 2 or 3, with thier choppy, geometric bodies. The animation is complete â¥â¥â¥â¥ as well, the sounds are just irritating (THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING POP NOISE MKDSALHJKSDKWA). There is no story, and no main objective the only story there is is `Here is some ore and zombies, collect the ore make a gun and â¥â¥â¥â¥ them up`. The castle you start out with has no other purpose than to hide on top of like a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, but even then skeletons snipe you with thier bows (Really, bows?! MINECRAFTTTTTT) or for zombies to somehow climb on top of it and â¥â¥â¥â¥ you or something.     2/10 still little bit of fun and costs like 2$ so yeh.  Graphics= Aids sim  Gameplay= â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Please  Sounds= MY â¥â¥â¥â¥ING EARS  Story= What's That?
11285	I was expecting better than this..
11286	horid
11287	Don't.
11288	This game sucks zombie balls.
11289	Cant join servers, TO much gay boys on this game, when you cant do anything just go play World at War.
11290	My Friend gifted me this game, we aren't Friends anymore
11291	If you can't be bothered to read my experiences with Castle Miner Z, feel free to watch this video, because it shows our experience with it.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdcrQPqNCqM   Me and a friend jumped into this with fairly low expectations for obvious reasons and in return we were given a buggy mess. Below is pretty much my gripes with the game.   1) My gun fully disappeared, literally all of my items and enemies became completely invisible when I started. 2) Is it just me or is it ALWAYS night time in castle miner? 3) It is near impossible to get down a 1x1 hole due to the game's auto-climb feature. 4) The crafting system is down-right odd. Usually you craft some tools for basic survival, but in Castle Miner Z you start with nothing, build a pickaxe, straight to a machine gun and then something that definitely is not a lightsabre.  5) The idea of building is almost completely pointless because of the sheer amount of stuff that can destroy it, even your basic zombies destroy layers of materials to get into your base. 6) Should the zombies get in, running away isn't a viable option because every type of screaming enemy is considerably faster than you are. 7) Staying and fighting also isn't much of an option either, since it only takes about four hits to be killed.   Just buy and mod minecraft like a sane person. 
11292	There's nothing to be said. As much as this game would love to be a more 'action filled' version of MineCraft, it simply can not live close to the standards.   Don't waste your money, unless you're looking for a waste of your time.
11293	Complete garbage, don't waste your time.
11294	This game SUCKS. It keeps disconnection on hosted games and in general SUCKS, DO NOT I REPEATE DO NOT BUY THIS GAME EVEN IF IT COSTS ALMOST NOTHING ITS NOT EVEN WORTH THAT!
11295	id rather die than play this game for 5 more secconds
11296	Another Minecraft clone. What else is new?  3/10 - Very Poor
11297	minecraft with mods 0/10. very unoriginal.
11298	I can honestly say, without a doubt, that this is legitimately the worst game I have ever seen. It's worse than Bad Rats, at least Bad Rats actually TRIED. CastleMiner Z is unoriginal from its â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ mismatching assets to its core gameplay to its name. You play as a normal SWAT Member in a completely blocky world full of Zombies and Skeletons and Dragons. I wish this game was satire or a parody, because then I'd at least have the solace of knowing that someone didn't actually think this was remotely a good idea, nonetheless a FINISHED PRODUCT. Please don't even buy the game as a joke, the developers do not deserve any sort of money for this.
11299	The xbox version is a ton better than this For one it tends to close off on me.. and even when it did load it didnt register acheivements. I would definintely reccomend the xbox version over this because its ten times easier to use voice chat too. It also sucks in a sense of bad facebook and twitter opens
11300	*dig dig dig* *clink clink clank* Woo, i have a lot of shiny diamonds and golds. *clink!*   Fell to surface of hell and died, diamonds are now property of hell.   Pros and cons: + Since concept is good, you can play a few hours with fun  - Crafting options are limited - Crafting menu is HORRIBLE, it could be useful easily but it is NOT - Animations are bad - Most of models and textures are bad/low quality - Repetitive - Price... you should obtain it via bundles - Achievements don't work on other mods which i found it weird.  Better continue to play Minecraft, Terraria and Starbound...
11301	This game looked good from a few angles. Yeah, its cheap, but in all I gave it a rough 2/10 . Sure, the mechanics of the game are doing what they are meant to do but the Controls are buggy, mouse movement really â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up, and its just... weird.  :(
11302	
11303	I don't recomend this game that much as when you die you lose your stuff and you can't retrive it it's gone forever! also the gun textures never change so it's just the 1 same looking gun for every catagory which is dumb, i think this game would be better if i fricken white smoke doesn't go allover my screen when i mine 1 block and i can't see a thing! I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS GAME! BUY SOMETHING ELSE FOR 5$ JUST NOT THIS! THIS IS CRAP!
11304	This game is sh*t. When I attempt to start the game, for some reason it does not work. as a result of me not being able to play the game and leaving me with Â£4 less. As of this I am very annoyed and recamend you do NOT buy this game.
11305	Dont buy this is sucks, needs to be updated and free until worthy
11306	I started up Castle MinerZ and... straight away the intro music was saying 'no effort had been put into this game' a few hours later later the intro screen popped up and.. oh... another minecraft rip off, i made a server, added a friend and i was already flooded with random people joining. after kicking them and stetting the server to private (which isn't the default) i tried treating it like an actual game and after looking through the inventory and realising the only few differences were:   less pixelation in items and mobs, no crafting tables dispensers of furnaces (just do it with your hands)    you dont teleport to the 'Nether' but you dig your way down to hell,    and... of course, guns, lazer swords and RPG's (your annoying-looking character knows how to craft these at from the beggining by the way).  And i would say it doesnt have a bad atmosphere... if it didnt have every sound effect copied from other games, from the start-up noise of SCP-containment breach to LEGO sound effects and scuttering from another game i cant remember the name of...   and: DUST! DUST! DUST IN MY EEEEYYYYEEEESSSS!!!!!!!!  For a game of 2014 you'd expect it not to look like a minecraft/quake hybrid and at least have the textures work properly.. half an hour after i started the world my torch texture dissapeared, and a few minuites after that the game crashed and just told me:   error, the game crashed, we are trying to fix this   my mouse was still locked off the screen so i had to press enter to close the screen and the game, i attempted to log onto my world again... it crashed before it loaded with the same screen.. i tried again and this time it   loaded! and i found out it was a great game and wasnt another crappy rip off and we lived happily ever after   NOPE.. it only loaded the torches... and you.. everything thing i held was invisible and every block and mob except torches.. i logged off.. logged back on... and of course it was the exact same thing... i close it down, uninstall the game and find myself here   ive read some other reviews.. and the comments on them seem to be things like 'nyot evry spuar gmae is mincraeft' and 'its not a minecraft ripoff because its harder and has more things!' to which i say: excuse me   HAVE YOU LOOKED THROUGH THE GAME??!!??   you have shovels, pickaxes, axes, iron, gold, diamond, zombies, skeletons with bows, dragons, hell, 16-bit textures and even the bad AI. THIS. IS. NOT. AN. ORIGINAL. GAME.  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME  ever  ever  get it for free of their website for fre....... ... ...    WHAT!!??!!    THIS struck me as unbelievable, i cant see anyone playing and enjoying this game unless they are a 6 year old with no knowledge of games AND extremely high. Z/Z would not accept gift again                  teehee    sandjob   
11307	this game is like mexican food. it may look good,but after you eat it you will know the tru meaning of pain.
11308	I got it for free, and I still feel like I paid too much.
11309	You haven't seen quality like this before. This is hands down the greatest zombie game that has ever existed. You haven't lived until you have played this game. In order to get the full experience you have to buy it 46 times and then it's true potential is released.
11310	Terrible game, waste of 4 dollars. Do not buy
11311	it is to the point where i will not only not say anything about this game to anyone ever, i will talk extremely bad about it. i died so many time just trying to get to my friends, it is a game that even if it is on sale, i would never buy. even if it was free, i would never re download. it is one of those games that as soon as your feet touch the soil, you have every cancer known to man and then add about 106,897 new cancers to that. it is a game, that if i could, i would throw in the trashcan, burn the entire trash can, and then burn down the house becuse the game came in contact with the trash can which touched the house. DO NOT BUY!!!!! DO NOT DOWNLOAD IF IT IS EVER FREE!!!!!!
11312	If you want to die repeatedly buy this game
11313	This game was very rushed... I dont think anyone should buy it unless they make a really big update.    And i mean BIG
11314	Horrible game. Minecraft clone that features guns. Thats pretty much all it adds. Oh yea! The 'Super realistic weapon and mob models'!
11315	this game is a load of hochunk gaming  - chaun - ig
11316	Good god, it's like a bad xbox indie game (TURNS OUT IT IS!)  -GFX are beyond sub par -Aiming is painful with lower sensitivity on y axis than x axis -Voxel baseed world does little to nothing to differentiate from games like minecraft -Audio is UNBELIEVEABLE BAD -Feels floaty as hell and controlls are less responsive than a tranquilized turtle -Repetitive gameplay -Overall boring and unoriginal concept  Seriously, how does this have a 'Mostly Positive' review score?  This game is one of the reasons that people say steam is flooded with 'Greenlight Garbage' and is an evident product of the underage call of duty market, the scary thing here is that certain games on DOS were easier on the eyes than this aborted minecraft clone  Can I get a refund? I worked half an hour for the dosh for this game...
11317	Launches Game Accepts the contract Wait Wait Wait Does not open Retrys Still does not work Uninstall  10/10 Waste of money 
11318	Not very good, I was pleased on the xbox, but on hereit won't work and my computer meets the requirments.
11319	I think the game was definetly a lot of fun, but it was certainly short lived. The game is much too easy, unless you happen to play on easy or normal mode, in which case the game is nearly impossible. If you happen to want a hardcore game, then by all means, play this on normal from the start. Otherwise, I think this game needs much more updating to have any lasting fun. Last, but not least, there is a modding system to this game that was recently released as of my writing this review. However, DigitalDna has not revealed any information on how to mod this game, or even how to backup your saves (as far as I know... Although I did do quite a bit of research on the topic). All in all, I don't think the game is worth buying, even if it is only $5.00.
11320	For the a while after I got this game I actually did enjoy it. Though the game's world does kind of rip-off Minecraft (and don't say this came before, Minecraft was late in beta and at the height of its popularity), the gameplay in it is quite a bit different than Minecraft. Basically, the objective of this game is to craft weapons and mine resources, while trying to get further away from the spawn, which will bring the player to new biomes with stronger enemies and better materials. Eventually you will run into the game's boss in the final biome. There is also somewhat of an objective to stay alive for as long as possible.  The main thing to keep in mind though, is that this game really isn't geared to building much; it takes a long time to mine anything, and the further out you are the stronger the materials you will need, so the best thing you can build is a small bunker. Also, I find that this game does not expand much on survival; most of the game is trying to get as far as you can killing a few zombies that get in your way, though night-time can be dangerous, the game doesn't provide much in the way of 'surviving' the zombie horde.  To be entirely honest, in the end, I do not recommend this game. Though I did originally enjoy this game it unfortunately does not have much replay value or staying power, and the gameplay is kind of shallow. Of course, on the other hand I haven't played anything quite like this game, and I do think, that though shallow, the gameplay is unique. If it looks interesting, and if you're more of a casual gamer, don't be afraid to try it, just don't expect much replayability.
11321	Poorly polished with 'HD' minecraft textures. Seems abandoned by the devs, or their bugchecking must suck. It's addicting because of how easy it is to die, and a great friend game, but there are just too many problems with it, mostly gameplay, but even things like network
11322	Waste of money i get fps lag, sensitvity is horrible, please fix this game or refund me.
11323	The game was good on 360, but here it sucks. It randomly crashes, the mouse moves to much (and you can't change it) and so many other things.
11324	A lot of the reviews for this game are short, non-descriptive, and/or sarcastic, so I will write a (hopefully) helpful one for those out there contemplating this purchase.  First things first, this pretty much is what everyone else says it is, it's Minecraft but with less crafting options, more guns, more/different enemies, and worse graphics.  As it stands right now I don't recommend the game, even for the on-sale price of $1, but I DO see potential in it, and it seems the devs are continuing to work on it, so that's a plus.  Basically you start the game out with nothing more than a few simple items like a compass, pistol, some ammo, and a pickaxe. It's then your job to survive, while also collecting resources to build yourself a shelter and more weapons. In my opinion, the UI is still ugly, and crafting isn't really that intuitive, it's built around hovering over buttons to reveal more options and buttons you can hover over to see more options.  One thing I didn't like is that a zombie can literally spawn on top of you and start screeching. It's 2:30am and that scared the **** out of me.  Anyway. I won't refund this, I'll keep it in my game library to see where the devs take it.  If any of what I've said sounds good to you, why not try it, it's only $1, you don't really have a whole lot to lose. :P
11325	There is not much I can say about this game that is positive. To be honest I think most of it is taken from other games cut and paste into it. The gun sounds for example come from Half Life 1. The zombie sounds are the same as those used in 7days to die (not 100% sure which used them first since this game is older but it was ported to pc recently with some updates so it is possble). There are 2 diff types of models in this game that simply are as different as night and day. The skeletons and zombies look low res with sharp edges while the dragon and demons are so smooth and rounded they could have come from 2 different games. Its just a waste of your cash and this guy that made it already got his quick cash from the xbox indie marketplace and is now trying to do the same with the pc. Dont fall for this joke of a game and stay faaaar away.
11326	I honestly hate this game, I bought the 4 pack so 3 friends can play it with me and what do I get nothing! Except one copy for myself, It's a f*cking rip off I want my money back!
11327	I bet this game is good but my game is not working it will not load and I hope it will be fixed later so that I can grade it fully.
11328	Aside from the addition of guns, there's nothing about this game that you wouldn't find in Minecraft, which makes it just another of the hundreds of Minecraft clones out there.  Problems are, in no particular order:  1. You start with 100% health, which regenerates quickly after a minor delay. The first enemy you encounter can kill you in two hits. There is no armor to craft, so unless you kill the enemy attacking you or run away from it, you're dead after that first hit.  2. The final boss of Endurance mode, a big stupid dragon, comes out of nowhere on the surface whenever the hell it so chooses - in my case, it was before I had even upgraded my pickaxe.  3. There is no sound when hitting enemies.  4. Upon death, all of your inventory is gone. There is no option to retrieve what you've lost.  5. Certain items require ridiculous amounts of resources to craft.  6. The 'Hell' stage (ripoff from Minecraft, as with everything else) doesn't require digging down far at all.   Was it worth a dollar? I guess so. Would I recommend that you, or anyone else, spend that dollar? No. If this game were in Early Access, I'd completely understand its unpolished state. But there will be no further development.  Avoid - get yourself four gumballs instead.
11329	Don't even bother, animations are terrible, gameplay is horrible, concept is horrible, combat is horrible etc. Not worth it at all
11330	worse game I ever played. I didn't know the zombies can jump very high and faster than the players. very fast to die.  Even when i died i lost all my items. Really â¥â¥â¥â¥. A lots of enemies,  IF anyone want to get space goo, you must go 2~3 people. Alien will respawn after 3 sec when you kill alien.
11331	Games actually really fun But its broken and you pretty much can't find any fixes , or get any help so â¥â¥â¥â¥ you Castle Miner Z, in fact i'm going to actually contact the developer of the game and see if i can get them to do something about this!!!! â¥â¥â¥â¥ MOTHER â¥â¥â¥â¥!!!!!
11332	This is game is just no, the sensitivity is so ridiculous that even at the lowest setting the camera feels like if it was put higher than 100% sensitivity. When you die you start from where you originally spawned so you can't creat spawn points and creative mode isn't even creative mode. Even if it is I should just be given what I want to use to create what I want to create by just being given all the items in a selection in the crafting area. Also when you die you drop all your ores yet sometimes your ores just disappear when you return to get even though it was 3 minutes for you to go back to where you originally died. Plus enemies deal too much damage which is garbage and there is no armor upgrades or crafting new armor . This game just sucks combat is sort of fun, but this game just sucks I thought it was fun at first untill all this other crap happened to me.
11333	it sucks 
11334	My friend gifted me this game and at first it was alright at the time I played alot of minecraft type games and I liked it but after the first session it was so boring. I tried to go back and play and almost fell asleep me. I can't recommend this game unless you enjoy 2004 minecraft. Don't waste your money on this garbage if you want it that bad buy an Xbox and pay $1 for it 2/10
11335	cant play the game anymore everything became invisible every world i go into is invisible deleted and reinstalled still broken
11336	CastleMinerZ is the full package when it comes to bad games. It has a generic premise (Minecraft-Clone Zombie Survival), awful animations, bad graphics, low quality sound effects, boring objective(Run away from where you started for as long as possible), unsatisfying combat, tedious mining, unvaried enviroments, and a clumsy inventory system. If you can pick it up cheap it might be fun as a so-bad-it's-good game.
11337	my friend used space drill, 3 sec late game crashes, reason is that your ram is full
11338	I tried changing the mouse sensitivity but it dosen't work.
11339	This game is utter â¥â¥â¥â¥
11340	Why Couldn't The Refund Policy Come Out Earlier.... ._.   Im Sorry but Im never touching this game again. 10 hours is bad enough.
11341	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
11342	Minecraft Knock Off. To be honest it doesnt look as good as Minecraft nor does it have enough features to even consider buying it.
11343	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hell this game is so good, it's like minecraft if minecraft was on PC and had guns OH WAIT
11344	made me kill my family 2/10
11345	made my snes -1 still moved liek sanic     10/10
11346	Sucks more than life itself 
11347	This game is has high quality........ for a game that was made in 2002 btw aliens in metors look like the meme 'ITS A TRAP'
11348	i cant play it. it isnt in my game library. DONT BUY
11349	minecraft? or cs? 
11350	i play it no server in the game :(
11351	I suppose the game itself had its good tries buuut....Well it's the community in the game. It's Minecraft all over again on multiplayer. Griefers, people that find glitches that ruin the experience of other players, etc etc. That crap. Unless you plan to play with friends only, or offline, then I don't recommend this thing.
11352	PUT A UPDATE WHERE IT IS LAG-FREE OR IM DELETING IT!~!!!!!!!!!!!
11353	its terrible, not as i expected but definitely as advertised, same as all other games that look similar, has guns but they arent fun to fire in particular (projectile range is pitiful and unrealistic, not satisfying), it kinda serves no purpose as you treck halfway across the never-never to find it gets incredibly harder and you will die and respawn at the beginning realising you never got any farther, going away from the respawn spot is just as useful to you as staying... cant say i recommend it....
11354	Nah, it's to expensive (you can buy some preservatives, some kush, icecream) for a mixture of minecraft and other piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ ! Don't buy it, don't expend your money on this...
11355	This game should have stayed on Xbox-live
11356	terible game i hate it the grapics are â¥â¥â¥â¥ can i get a refund plz
11357	
11358	I rate this game 911/1337 on a rainy day but if it is sunny then i can give you a cookie ok?
11359	It just feels unfinished by alot. junky gamplay. just played it not for very long. couldnt even get started.
11360	85% Don't buy. TL:DR: Save your money and buy Minecraft OR look around on gamejolt for a Minecraft-like game, they're uploaded all the time.  This game really isn't the greatest. It's something that you pick up for maybe an hour or two, but then put back down because there are other games to play. It's not horrible, but the overall feeling of playing the game is bleh and sluggish. Also, zombies 'grab' you which is bull**** because the zombies run 2-3 times faster than you. On the bright side, at least the developers didn't abandon the PC port like we all thought they did and they are now actively updating the game.(After a few years...)
11361	Its been a while since i last played this game but it seems as though its getting regular updates.  Maybe i will try it again one day?  I don't know.
11362	I bought this game at retail, witch was 15 dollars at the time. There goes my money.  rating -1000000000/1000000000
11363	This game didn't hold up. It was great when it released on 360 a few years back but the 'upgraded' graphics pretty much ruined it for me. It takes itself too seriously for what it is, a minecraft clone. It plays pretty good if you can get past the look but it was much better years ago
11364	It's pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥, I guess. Not worth it for the coin. I don't think it's being updated anymore.
11365	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ minecraft hack is a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ minecraft hack. Don't waste your time. The graphics are dumb, there are no jumping animations, and mouse accell seems to be permanently on, causing this weird hitching where your whole view will blink ahead, making aiming impossible. No options to change mouse or keyboard config.  This game was trying to capitalize on what Minecraft is missing - combat, giving all those buildings and resource mining a purpose.
11366	This game is the crappiest thing ive ever seen. On xbox its fun, but here, it's the icing on the â¥â¥â¥â¥ cake we call fun 
11367	*sigh* one of my first xbox games that i still hold in deep regaurd for my heart. Sadly the pc port has too many bugs to get over. I crashed atleast 5 times in an hour. Please fix and i will change. But this is still a good game :P
11368	I want my money back! -_-
11369	brought this game to play with my son, as we both have minecraft i thought it might be ok inspite of most of the recent reviews......BIG MISTAKE total pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ save your cash for something else, even if this were free to play i would avoid it like the plague..
11370	i would rather get eatin by a shark then play this game
11371	Take 80% of minecraft, 10 percent of counterstrike, 8 percent of skyrim, and 2 more percent from alot of various other games...  Throw them into unity and blend it all together, and you have...  A waste to money.  Not a single part of this is original. Literally not one.  Worlds are literally carbon copies of Minecraft ones, only there's a lighthouse to serve as a checkpoint. It's indestructible. Hell is like it is in Terraria, only you don't need to go far to get into it. Basically 50 Y levels down is a total drop into hell, pretty much. Hell has nearly no reason to exist, quite literally.  Dragons are in this from skyrim, Zombies are in this, skeletons too, that's all you'll have for enemies. Zombies kill you in three hits, Skeletons too, Dragons do so instantly. Hit detection is literally barebones. Damage is dealt before the proper time in the animations.  This game has less content than freaking StarForge for crying out loud. Starforge atleast has 4 tiers of tools, and even weaons of different types, and 4 tiers of armors, vehicles, blocks to create your bases with, and terminals to serve as faster crafting stations and a respawn in hte form of a bed... Even chest-like containers This game however has only 5 block types to craft, 4 tiers of tools, 4 tiers of 2 weapons, no crafting stations, 2 chest types, no armors, no vehicles.  Seriously. This game is literally Counter-Strike: Minecraft with 2% of the content, none of the mod support, no ability to make texture packs and easily install them and even swap between them... and all for the literal same price of Minecraft, or Terraria, take your pick.  This game, like Starforge is basically evidence that you can make money off of nothing but other people's hard work and that we need a Storefront Quality Control team.  Sure, there's a mode called Endurance where you don't save the world, and dying is permanent, but it serves no real purpose. It's just an obligatory 'Hard' difficulty.  Get Minecraft. This game, like Starforge, is a Crime against Gaming itself. Plagarism. The Devs need to learn what that is, and Steam too, due to it still being here.  The ONLY thing is has over Minecraft, is it's server browser.  This game isn't worth downloading, it isn't worth a dollar, it isn't worth even even one tenth of your dog's crap.  It isn't difficult and the game is designed by someone who is clearly not old enough to know what.  Final Note: This game has basically no reason to exist. Watching paint dry is more enjoyable and you'll be more likely to do it after buying.
11372	Why is this a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game. Most of the models have Ebola...
11373	this the worst game of all time!!!! i want a refund. you spawn in with a pistol and bad tools anywhere you walk a zombie gets out of the ground out of nowhere. it is such a copy of minecraft and the only new thing is guns. don't buy this game you will regret it.
11374	Sadly i need to say this, this game is freaking poor. Trust me, the 5 hours that I played on this game was the same all over and over...  The graphics are really bad and finding a server takes so long that makes you think 'why did I buy this game?!'  Honestly this game needs a revival tool named Content...  4/10
11375	I tried to give it a fair shake, and to BE fair, it is a decently inspired game, but that's all it is. Inspired. It is minecraft with gunz, if you couldn't tell from the screenshots, but the variety is worse than Minecraft's beta stage from way back when. It is fun for a few hours, if you get past the bugs, but then you hit top tier, and find that you can't even build a nice-looking house.
11376	really bad
11377	Steam may not be running........
11378	This game was really fun, everyone should buy it, however my only grievance is that this game isn't more expensive. At 5$, this game is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too low a price for the though and expertise made by the developers to make a game that will top any gamers Top 10.  10/10, very nice                    ***jk this game is dog â¥â¥â¥â¥, don't buy please. spend the money on castrating yourself or something, but not this unfinished, unoptmized, piece of human excrement.***
11379	1 Star!!!! this is a Diamond in the rough the game has many bugs   if they Fix most of the bugs I will rate it better...
11380	Game is crap and boring so ill say it straight,  DONT BUY IT
11381	It worked for ONE day, Now when ever I open it, it either crashes or when I load a world nothing has loaded and everything is invisible! 2/10 DO NOT GET!
11382	its a good game but it crashed for no reason i got a good pc to play it just likes to crash i guess
11383	A waste of money, there is almost no content and no online community.  NOT RECCOMENDED!
11384	Just another Rip off copy cat game of minecraft, when you could have more fun playing minecraft. DONT GET THIS GAME  2/10
11385	First off, I'd just like to say you know a game is bad when it somehow manages to screw up the classic Adjective Noun title format. Here we have NounNoun- and there's not even a space between the two words! It also suffers from 'title is non-indicative of game content, better tack on a Z to show it has zombies.'  As for the game itself? It's utter garbage. I can appreciate that it still took them time to make, but to go and sell this for $5 is a horrible error in judgement, and should be observed as such. 'Oh but Law, you haven't even played it for more than an hour!' You're damn right I didn't. I played it for 8 minutes I think, and it's no hyperbole when I say that's all it took to see all the game had to offer. To be fair, 5 of those 8 minutes I spent in the pause menu, because I got up to make a sandwich.  0/10 It wasn't even a good sandwich and I had to make a deal with the Devil to get my 8 minutes back.
11386	CastleMiner Z - Raymond K. Turcotte  Yet Another Minecraft rip-off. Personally I think that game companies should stop makeing Minecraft rip-off games because they don't do as good as Minecraft, no matter what! Back on topic, i don't even understand how to play this game. A friend from New York recommended this game to me way back when on Xbox Live. I listened to him, bought it. Personally i had no intrest. So many people say 'Wow, what a great game. It's giving minecraft a run for it's money'. - Ya right, as if! Let's face the facts. Minecraft will never be betten. It's first of it's kind.
11387	A complete and utter Minecraft ripoff with boring gameplay like hell. On the other hand if you like to get constantly â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ by monsters just after spawning in the game while trying to get those 2 iron ores for the purpose of some form of weapon crafting ( of course you lose all youre inventory the moment you die so good luck single players ! ) then this is the game for you !!. For a price of 9 euros just go buy Minecraft for less...
11388	Thank god i got this gifted.
11389	sucks so much â¥â¥â¥â¥..
11390	i did not play 9 hours of this
11391	Its a really â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ minecraft clone, and I do mean REALLY â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.   I only played this one for about 30 minutes after I got gifted it as a joke, so far here is what I have observed:  -The graphics are repulsive and the models and animations are some of the laziest I have ever seen, as an example one thing I noticed immediately was the pistol model where the characters thumb fazes through the handle of the pistol. Another thing of note is the out of place character models that look like they were taken from another game, everybody looks like a CT from counter strike or something.  -Crafting is way less fun then in minecraft, (The thing its trying to ripoff) You do not need to build furnaces or work benches you just get resources and somehow build and smelt things with your bare hands without the assistance of tools. The only tools to speak of are the shovels and pickaxes and etc that you can use to get the resources faster and etc so its really just like a dumbed down less fun minecraft.   -There is no hunger or thirst or anything to worry about, just your health which regenerates so there is little to no real 'survival' element of the game to speak of.  -The enemies I observed were:  The zombies which in this one are fast and can climb things, during the day you will only encounter a couple but during the night they become really annoying because they spawn right next to you and precede to form a mob in order to kill you.   A skeleton with a bow and arrow which shows up occasionally to annoy you.  And a dragon which is supposed to try to destroy your base but spends a lot of time trying to destroy the permanent indestructible spawn tower which means you can just shoot at it while It attacks this thing it cant destroy because the programmers were too lazy to make an exception for that building.    -Lastly me and my friend went into a server to see what the online was like and my friend wanted to see if the devs even bothered with any kind of anti cheat system, he used a really obvious cheat engine that any basic hack detection would be able to detect and found himself speed hacking around the place with ease, essentially meaning that there is no anti-cheat to speak of.  I could continue playing to give a more concrete review but I REALLY dont want to play anymore of this crap. Everything about this game just SCREAMS 'lazy cash grab with zero effort put into it.'
11392	This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥. I changed the resolution once and it permanently broke the game. â¥â¥â¥â¥ you DigitalDNA, your game is coded by autistic children
11393	This game blows.
11394	cant even play it
11395	UM LIXO!
11396	So, normally I'd wait until I at least played a couple more hours before writing something, but it's a different story when there's so little content. Just by looking at it, it might just look like another voxel based game with a texture pack installed, some guns, and a dark atmosphere. However, it's not minecraft. Minecraft at least has reasons to build and explore. CastleMiner Z has little reason to build or explore. If you play the games 'survival' mode, you'll find yourself rather confused. The goal of this gamemode is to simply run as far as you can. Seriously. As you progress, a meter keeps track of how far you go, and enemies constantly spawn around you. There are caves and ores to mine, with which you can use to craft different tools and weapons. That's it really.  SURE, you CAN build structures with an incredibly limited amount of different resources, but there's no reason to stay in one spot AT ALL. The point is to keep moving, and really there's no reason to get attached to your structure anyway as there's little to do with it.  In Minecraft, you have to at least keep your avatar fed. In CastleMinerZ, there is no such thing. This means, your only sense of urgency are the enemies, which is fine, BUT NOT ON IT'S OWN. Health also regenerates, however with how fast it drains anyway, that might not be a terrible thing.  This means, playing this game boils down to one formula: 1. Run 2. Kill enemies 3. Get swarmed at night 4. Go into cave to mine until day 5. Make Gun 6. Repeat  There is little to do in terms of new strategies except maybe mine all resources in a cave and then move on, hoping you mined enough to make a new gun and ammo for it.  I heard this game was $10 on Steam before. I also heard is was $1 on Xbox 360. It should have remained $1. I know the developers need to make their money, but not when you offer very little of value to begin with. Effort means nothing if that effort doesn't have anything to actually show for it.  Now, I am being harsh. There CAN be some fun to be had with this game, but not for very long. Once you've played every game mode once, maybe twice, you've experienced all the potential fun this game really had to offer.   I played a couple games with random online players, and they usually ended up being children. Which is fine. But I'm an adult, who doesn't always want to play with children. There are also barely any other people playing this game online, so you might as well beg one of your good friends to lay down $5 on this game to play with you.  My hope is, the developers aren't abandoning this game as it is. I hope this isn't 'complete'. There could be more content for sure, or at least some respectable mod support.
11397	it sucks. dont buy this
11398	Castle my â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
11399	I really liked Minecraft so I decided to give this one a chance. I mean, I thought that it was really cool the idea of crafting and using firearms, which is something that you can also do in Minecraft, except that you can only achieve that through the use of mods. Either way, in my modest opinion, this whole concept falls apart when you can't even get a single second of relief in order to plan what you want to do. I mean, there're enemies spawning from everywhere all the time. Yeah, I understand that the game has to be challenging in order to be interesting but in that case, it's just simply annoying. Overall, stick to the mods, you really won't regret skipping this title.
11400	this game is good but it crashing EVERY 30 MINUTES GETS REALLY ANNOYING AND IS DRAGGING ME TO THE POINT OF SUICIDE
11401	  this is a horrible game i cant even paly the thing
11402	If you haven't gained enough autism from Minecraft, try this even worse version of it with even more autism!
11403	This game has potential, and I see what the producers are trying to do as far as horror survival goes. But this game needs more variety of items and weapons STAT! Not only that, I happen to have a laundry list of things they need to add:  - A better communication system: I like the fact that you could type to your teammates. Which is a step in the right direction for a lack of a better term. But please consider voice chat because it's faster to give information to player and piers around you.  - Sound effects: I would prefer this game to not recycle the same sound effects over and over. Especially the walking sound effect. I'm sorry but the last time I walked on grass, and snow I would never hear my foot tap. It's not that difficult either, just get a boom microphone and gather yourself or a team to go out and record sounds in the real world and import them in your game.   -Weapons Variety: Add more guns, and melee weapons. I'm sorry but I don't want just simply cliched weapons that are popular to use. Try to add more modern weapons that would be used in warfare. I suggest looking at GTA V or Call of Duty as a source considering that the games has a variety of weapons that you could look at. So you could study them and recreate them in whatever videogame program you use, and import them in your game.  - Too dark in Hell: I understand it's supposed to make Hell scary and makes the player more unwilling to go. But at least light it up a little bit because I just simply can't stand planting a torch everytime I walk through Hell. Not only that, enemies are rampet in Hell, so how the heck am I supposed to walk through the biome if I can't see the enemies?  - Enemy Variety: Okay you have so far Skeletons, Dragons, Aliens, Demons, and Zombies. I could count all those enemies on the tip of my 5 fingers right now. Therefore this shows that you need more enemies. If I would suggest anything I say:  *Blood thursty wolves(Non-tameable) *Dinosaurs(Like the T-rex, or veloceraptors) *Bats in the caves *Big Spiders *Alien Demon(AKA an Alien boss) *Snakes that attack(Mostly in sandy tarrain) *Evil NCPs we can combat against(Bandits, Burgulars, Intruders, pirates)  Boom right there spick and span a list of enemies! You could litterally use anything in a game like this. Usually relevance doesn't really matter in vlox games because obviously we need to be able to have a variety of creatures to fight.  - Make the players customizable already!: Honestly during the development of 1.7, you guys should've created those cusomizable characters by now. I'm sorry but, either make them customizable, or give us armor.   - Make the players feel more rewarding: Okay grant it, you have the achievements in the game. Though, I would also prefer there to be an experience system within the game itself. Doing this will actually get other players and I to keep playing. Not only that, have a system where you could upgrade your stamina, health, reload speed, etc..  - Have villages, town, cities: There's nothing more boring than just walking through tarrien of empty forests, sandy grounds, and icy mountains. So I would suggest having civilization somewhere in the game. Probably have an abandon town, or something like that. Or at least villages with items and resources you could collect and explore from. _________________________________________________________________________________  Like I said this game has potential, but there's still some work that needs to be done. 1.7 may have boosted your game visually, but not morale and that urge of players wanting to keep playing is becoming really low. I've played this game since its release on the Xbox 360 in 2011. I thought it was a really fun game at the time, including the 1.5-1.6 updates that I looked forward to those updates in the past. But now the game is starting to suck because we've played through the same kind of thing over and over. That's because there's little no variety, no customization, and little to no fan requested content.  Here's the reason why you're still getting bad reviews. It's not getting bad reviews because of the look of the game (Sure that would be the case of picky people who want visually compelling graphics) it's because the suggestion that people give you to make the game even better are practecly being IGNORED.   I actually saw little to no changes based on what your fanbase requested you to add to make your game better. Please just enable modding so that the people in this community and who support your game could make it entertaining for everyone else. So you wouldn't have to worry about updating your game every couple months.   Would've I give it a, 'Yes' if the game was more geared towards a friendly fanbase system. Yeah I would.  But sadly I'm giving this a thumbs down. DNA I like the stuff you make, and I'm sorrry. But either listen to your community, or just simply dictate your game however you please and leave out the things that the fans requested you to do. Overall it's your choice, your game, and your call.   And that is all that needs to be said... And I'm simply done here people.     
11404	The game is like Minecraft on its alpha version. And i quess that the game itself seems to be too...  There is much nothing interesting outside, outside world is a dangerous place, and at night it is hell. It is good that its dangerous, after all the monsters from Hell itself have breaken trought, but there is basically no other reasons to go outside, than to cut down some trees to make tools and weapons and to build your underground home to a new place  The game seems to be like under working and it is like on alpha version. It has basic tools, but only those basic tools. You can build your house, but there is nothing to fill it up, not working benches, furnitures...only crates. You live inside four walls, and there is nothing else than you and maybe a few of crates. The rooms starts to feel really dreary after you have build them. Imagine yourself playing Minecraft and building a house. The house is 10x10 blocks and its under the ground. The walls are made of stone and you have a staircase to surfase and at night you have to block it if you dont have a door. And even if your house is at surface, you have no windows, no beds, nothing to make it feel comfortable, nothing to make it feel special. You dont even know when it is day or night if there wouldnt be that mark what says 'Day (x)' after a day have passed and its safe to get to the surface again.  The monsters are scary, and they make really creepy noises and at night there a thousands of them and they are all screaming above you and trying to scrabble their way to get you... Afterall the monsters are made really well and are creepy as #@%*. There is a big weapon selection, but there is no reason to kill monsters, they dont drop anything unusual, basically you shoot them to defence yourself, but thats all.  After all the game is good, but its main con is that it gets boring really fast. You live underground in an empty room and mine to get minerals, what you use to make tools, powerfull walls or to make kick-â¥â¥â¥ weapons and to shoot some zombies head to pieces.   So, in a nutshell pros and cons: +Big weapon category +REALLY creepy monsters +Destructive enviroment (you AND the monsters can destroy blocks, really big pro) +The game have a nice idea :)  -Not much to craft -Cant decorate houses -You spend most of your time mining -A big lack of common stuff -Surface is very boring and there is much nothing to do there -Nothing special at the game  If there could be something interesting at the surface or something more to craft than just tools and weapons the game would be a little bit more enjoyable The game needs some really big uptades, and i think that this game would be really enjoyable with some extra stuff, just like Minecraft. Minecraft would be boring if there wasent animals, biomes, decoration stuff and a lot off stuff to craft. This game is like simplifield version of the Minecraft: There are mining tools, weapons, crates where you can store your stuff and monsters to make the game difficult. Sounds really boring, eh? I hope that the gamemakers are working hard and have a attitude and have a passion to make the game better and better, to reach the point where it is nearly as good as Minecraft, which the game is imitading. If the game is imitading and is based on Minecraft, why not to imitade even more to make it as good as Minecraft? Now the game would be better if it would be a mod in Minecraft, rather than a game.  4/10 
11405	  I got this game from my friend who always gifts me very â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ games.  Well it was really â¥â¥â¥â¥. Don't buy this. Please don't.
11406	Wow Great Graphic and Gameplay. KAPPA!   IGN- 1/10 would play again
11407	This game is so good it made me rip my eyes out. 10/10 IGN 9/10 GAMEREVIEWS 9/11 ALLAHU AKBAR
11408	built a house , went out mining , came back to a dragon burnning my home and the cheeky â¥â¥â¥â¥ had the nerve to attack me   0.5/10 this game makes me want to abuse people
11409	I got this for like 7 cents and holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ it wasn't worth it. I could've bought a pencil and gotten more enjoyment out of it.  0/10 try harder
11410	NO. NO. NO.   STAY AWAY! OMFG... I cannot believe how quickly this game turned me off!! Everybody mentions Pros for this game that can draw people in, and honestly I think they were paid for reviews (bought by Dev or working with Dev).  This game SSSSSUUUUCCCCKKKKKSSSSS.   I can forgive games, Salt I didn't exactly like because much of it didn't make sense - at least it didn't infuriate me like CastleMiner Z does. The 5th Day is unforgiving, hard, limited to ONE map, only THREE enemies, one of those three enemies can kill you in TWO SHOTS, and there's perma death - I've been playing that BRUTAL survival &amp; craft game for 3 days now, but CastleMiner Z manages to get me to quit playing in LESS THAN A DAY!   Pros: - Pretty cool sky - You can craft stuff, if you TURN OFF enemies and can figure out how to get to crafting - There is guns (but the kitchen knife is better) - Looks like Minecraft  Cons: - The Sky is the only thing that looks good. - Your character looks like a Counter Strike soldier who was downgraded. - The Blocky world looks WORSE than Minecraft. - Its an obvious Minecraft copy (even tho the license agreement mentions 'no copying' or 'reverse-engineering') that manages to be crappy copy. - Enemies spawn from NOWHERE, forget making yourself a safe house, THERES NO SUCH THING AS SAFE!  - Easy difficulty? Thats Easy? Are YOU F-ing SERIOUS? Easy if you enjoy fighting a boss quicker than Dark Souls 1. Easy if have no issue with Skels showing up in your base MERE INCHES from you.  - Easy Mode, 'Enemies do less damage'. TWO HITS FROM ANYTHING IS DEATH! Lemme guess, Hard, everything insta kills you? - Options: Music volume, Resolution, Texture quality, View distance, Fullscreen on/off, and Mute music on/off. Thats it. SERIOUSLY, THAT IS IT. No controls, No Gameplay options, and no Brightness adjustment. I WISH I was joking, I really do. - Can you retrieve items lost? NO! You'll see your items for a few seconds, but you won't be able to get them back. - Is this game fun? Is dying a lot from BASIC Minecraft enemies 'fun'? What about respawning next to an enemy that kills you by breathing on you, is that fun?    There are FAR BETTER games on steam than this crap.  Salt is lazy with their Demo, but at least they aren't blatantly obvious. Unturned (free to play) looks more closely to Minecraft than this, its tough, hard, more limited than CMZ, but at least you have a chance at surviving.  The Fifth Day has 3 enemies, a brutal survival system, the building isn't great, and there's random lag, but at least its creative and not an instant â¥â¥â¥â¥ to you in very beginning.  I have NEVER spoken this badly against a game, especially this damn quick.... Now I know why this game is so cheap, because everything in it is cheap. If it ever goes beyond 1.99, you are being robbed.  I'll treat this as a lesson in my life - if it looks like CastleMiner Z, STAY AWAY.  Rating: 1 out of 10.
11411	garbage. i have more usefull stuff in my recycleing bin
11412	DO NOT BUY!!!! You may think that Â£3 is a grest deal for a 'Minecraft' style game! But it's not. This game is more repetitive and boring than Minecraft and apparently you can get it for free on the Xbox Live store.
11413	Its so horrible....
11414	this game is having ur girlfriend to bite of ur â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ is like having a girl have a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ fu ck u
11415	i rather just â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hang myself
11416	No No No No No. If you are even slightly considering this game, take this in to consideration  1. Go to your kitchen 2. get a glass of water 3. walk to your computer 4. tip glass 5. walk back to kitchen with EMPTY glass 6. put glass away 7. walk to bedroom 8. get pillow 9. scream that you just bought the worst game possibly ever made. 10. continue to cry until you get locked up into a mental asylum   now, do you want to do that, or save (enter $ amount here) and not be considered mental. Your choice.
11417	Literally played for like 10 minutes then refunded. This game sucks. Dont waste your 4 dollars on a game that should be paying you to play it.
11418	C'mon lets be real here, You all came from X360 and You all played this on the marketplace before Minecraft got ported to Console, Didn't You?  Giving this one a No because they make me play as some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ looking CS-ish dude rather than My wierd Blue haired 360 dude  33/97 almost as bad as the Xbox 360's Quality Assessment.
11419	the old update with the old texture was better it was simple eazy Then This Came
11420	why do I own this game
11421	when can i get a refund 
11422	WAKE ME UP WAKE ME UP INSIDE CANT WAKE UP
11423	According to all known laws of aviation,   there is no way a bee should be able to fly.   Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground.   The bee, of course, flies anyway   because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.   Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.   Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little.   Barry! Breakfast is ready!   Ooming!   Hang on a second.   Hello?   - Barry? - Adam?   - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up.   Looking sharp.   Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those.   Sorry. I'm excited.   Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son.   A perfect report card, all B's.   Very proud.   Ma! I got a thing going here.   - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me!   - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye!   Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!   - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry.   - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation.   Never thought I'd make it.   Three days grade school, three days high school.   Those were awkward.   Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive.   You did come back different.   - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.   - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah.   - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going.   Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.   Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead.   I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.   I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.   That's why we don't need vacations.   Boy, quite a bit of pompâ¦ under the circumstances.   - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are!   - Bee-men. - Amen!   Hallelujah!   Students, faculty, distinguished bees,   please welcome Dean Buzzwell.   Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class ofâ¦   â¦9:15.   That concludes our ceremonies.   And begins your career at Honex Industries!   Will we pick ourjob today?   I heard it's just orientation.   Heads up! Here we go.   Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.   - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary.   Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco   and a part of the Hexagon Group.   This is it!   Wow.   Wow.   We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life   to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.   Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive.   Our top-secret formula   is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured   into this soothing sweet syrup   with its distinctive golden glow you know asâ¦   Honey!   - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin!   - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins.   - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive   to improve every aspect of bee existence.   These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.   - What do you think he makes? - Not enough.   Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.   - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey   that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions.   Oan anyone work on the Krelman?   Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know   that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.   But choose carefully   because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.   The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.   What's the difference?   You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off   in 27 million years.   So you'll just work us to death?   We'll sure try.   Wow! That blew my mind!   âWhat's the difference?â How can you say that?   One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make.   I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.   But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?   Why would you question anything? We're bees.   We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.   You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?   Like what? Give me one example.   I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.   Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.   Wait a second. Oheck it out.   - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow.   I've never seen them this close.   They know what it's like outside the hive.   Yeah, but some don't come back.   - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks!   You guys did great!   You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!   - I wonder where they were. - I don't know.   Their day's not planned.   Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.   You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.   Right.   Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.   It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it.   Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.   Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too?   Distant. Distant.   Look at these two.   - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them.   It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.   Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!   He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!   - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out.   What were you doing during this?   Trying to alert the authorities.   I can autograph that.   A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?   Yeah. Gusty.   We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.   - Six miles, huh? - Barry!   A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.   - Maybe I am. - You are not!   We're going 0900 at J-Gate.   What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough?   I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.   Hey, Honex!   Dad, you surprised me.   You decide what you're interested in?   - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one.   Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?   Son, let me tell you about stirring.   You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.   You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing.   You know, Dad, the more I think about it,   maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.   You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?   That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.   Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!   - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny.   You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!   - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me!   Wait till you see the sticks I have.   I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!   Let's open some honey and celebrate!   Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae.   Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody âdawgâ!   I'm so proud.   - We're starting work today! - Today's the day.   Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone.   Yeah, right.   Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removalâ¦   - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left!   One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side.   - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar!   Wow!   Oouple of newbies?   Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!   Make your choice.   - You want to go first? - No, you go.   Oh, my. What's available?   Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.   - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on.   I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.   Wax monkey's always open.   The Krelman opened up again.   What happened?   A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.   Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.   Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!   Oh, this is so hard!
11424	no thanks...
11425	the game stuffes up and sosent run it does wen i am angry at pc but wene i am in a good mood i stuffes up :( ââ¨â
11426	â¥â¥â¥â¥k this game i hate i get into my server crashs on me suck my 3=====&gt; 
11427	This game,if you can even call it that, is one of the most wretched pieces of â¥â¥â¥â¥ I have ever played. It is a really bad jsut on the xbox where it is suppoed to be but on pc is is the worst â¥â¥â¥â¥ing port of any game I have ever seen. Ever.If some one tells you to but this â¥â¥â¥â¥ing thing,punch them in the stomache as hard as you can becuase they are in all likely hood,terrible pieces of human garbage.
11428	10/10 Would refund again.
11429	this game ..........................it kills me slowy     10/10would torture my self again
11430	This game is great if you dont like MineCraft.  This game will make you like MineCraft.  Go play MineCraft.
11431	minecraft with guns UTTER â¥â¥â¥â¥
11432	all i need to say is it sucks 
11433	UPDATE: Here we are 2015 and there hasn't been an update since 2014. I wish the refund feature would work for this game the devs have just stopped supporting it.
11434	I actually want to die because of this game. I hate this game so much. Laggy as hell, spazzy controls, and i want to die. -34423432/1
11435	'Game ran out of memory'
11436	If it was free i would give it a thumbs up. It was kinda fun for the first two hours. Not worth your money unless you really get into it.
11437	SAVE THE MONEY! Don't buy this game. It is a minecraft rip off. I feel the game is rushed. The sound and graphics are also terrible.

11439	Installed it. Started Survival. Walked for 2 mins. Met a dragon. He chased me. I got sick. Deinstalled it.
11440	Why are games like these even on Steam? CastleMiner Z is like a shoddy knock off of Minecraft, with even worse faux 3d graphics, with guns and zombies. Gameplay is extremely disappointing, I've had more fun on minesweeper than on this 'game'.  If anyone wants to try and write a more detailed review, send me a pm, and I'll send you a copy of the game. I stupidly bought the 4 pack to share with friends.  All copies have since been given away. probably for the better too! STEAM, bloody check the items for sale before posting them live!
11441	This game is a complete disaster, tries to copy Minecraft with â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ engine and gameplay.
11442	This game gave me ebola
11443	I rate this game badly, not because 'it's minecraft + dayZ' but because zombies spawn near you, no matter where you go.  there is no way to outrun them, unless you're on flat ground, and it's boring without friends.  I rate it about 3/20  (sorry to whoever gets butthurt about this review)
11444	Yep. It's a joke fo a game.
11445	omg, don't even try this crap ! stay away !
11446	horrible this game sucks
11447	 Ah MineCraft. Wait, DayZ? No it's MineCraftDayZ!  One of the worst copies of Minecraft I've ever seen. God awful skins/sprites, and terrible animations. Zombies are jiu jitsu taekwondo masters that can leap 50 feet in the air at you and spin kick, damn!  What a joke, f*ck this developer and f*ck this game!  0/10
11448	Its like Cancer with Guns
11449	STUPID HORRIBLE MINECRAFT RIPOFF!!!
11450	  Almost as good as Uriel's Chasm...

11453	I d rather watch a turd lose moisture in the blistering sahara desert than play this â¥â¥â¥â¥ of a game.....
11454	Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope. Unless they do a major update(like adding WATER), this does not worth your time.
11455	I've never said this about a video game, but I just have to say that the console version is better. There's a better community, better-placed control sensitivity, and voice communication. I have to give the PC version a 5.5/10, but the console version an 8.25/10
11456	basically the only screenshot you'll ever need to see  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=526989812   but honestly its okay its 2 bucks only if you want a quick laugh how badly done this game is then buy it on sale atleast they tried
11457	this game my boy... it sucks.
11458	Dont like it. you might though.
11459	  what does the z stand for?
11460	basically the only screenshot you'll ever need to see  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=526989812   but honestly its okay its 2 bucks only if you want a quick laugh how badly done this game is then buy it on sale atleast they tried
11461	Dont like it. you might though.
11462	want ebola? then â¥â¥â¥â¥ing buy this game. it has all the things you need: 1. Cancer graphics 2. Copying another game 3. â¥â¥â¥â¥ gameplay 4. cancer 5. wasted money that you could spend on skins that you could loose on csgojackpot 6. it sucks 7. im killing myself now
11463	  On a Scale of Murder Miners to Minecraft, I would give this a Roblox (Make of that what you will)
11464	Anoying bug where i get no icons on the items after day 2 ... Is this even posible ?
11465	Crashes. There goes Â£3.

11467	Yeah, just let me â¥â¥â¥â¥ing kill the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing forest dragon ez pz with the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing starter pistol dude, but one god damn â¥â¥â¥â¥ing zombie that â¥â¥â¥â¥s me from behind... I might as well get down on all fours and let the â¥â¥â¥â¥er â¥â¥â¥â¥ the absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of me. This game in endurance mode (which is the only mode in which you're able to get achievments,) is actually why kids in Iraq are getting â¥â¥â¥â¥ing executed. This game makes me want to' circumcise myself and my â¥â¥â¥â¥ing cat dude.    -love turtlez
11468	Heres a list of things that are better than this game  Farting on your own face  Killing your parents   Being sold into slavery  getting sh!t stuffed in your mouth  Getting fcked in the â¥â¥â¥ by roadhog  Taking 5 of zenyettas orbs straight up the @$$   Mei shooting a icecicle up your d!ck hole  eating @$$ for 9 hours straight
11469	I would rather spend the night with jimmy savile then play this heap of â¥â¥â¥â¥!!! please remove from steam and poor money into another game that needs it!  Singed ~[King]Daveyyy

11475	Think of everything â¥â¥â¥â¥ about minecraft and then add console port onto the end of it.  That's this game in a nutshell.

11494	This game need's god's help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The Holy Bible Containing the Old and New Testaments Translated out of the Original Tongues and with the Former Translations Diligently Compared &amp; Revised Set forth in 1611 and commonly known as the King James Version   The Old Testament   The First Book of Moses, Called Genesis [Genesis] 1 The Creation In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. Â¶ And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. Â¶ And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so. And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day. Â¶ And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so. And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good. And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good. And the evening and the morning were the third day. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13  6 Genesis 1 Â¶ And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years: and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also. And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good. And the evening and the morning were the fourth day. Â¶ And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven. And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good. And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth. And the evening and the morning were the fifth day. Â¶ And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so. And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good. Â¶ And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth. So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27  7 Genesis 2 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth. And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so. And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day. 2 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made. Man in the Garden of Eden Â¶ These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens, and every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground. But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground. 28 29 30 31 1 2 3 4 5 6  8 Genesis 2 And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul. And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed. And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Â¶ And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads. The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold; and the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone. And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia. And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates. Â¶ And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it. And the Lord God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. Â¶ And the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him. And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof. And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found a help meet for him. 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20  9 Genesis 3 And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof. And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man. And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman [heb. Isha], because she was taken out of Man [heb. Ish]. Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed. 3
11495	Minecraft Clone? Naah.. something worse...
11496	Horse Sh!t.
11497	i dont remember buying this but i demand a refund
11498	You know you're playing a terrible game when you force yourself to like it. For $3.75 ($15.00/4), this was entirely a disappointment. In fact, I should be compensated to endure such a graphically depressing, purposeless, rip-off of a Minecraft mod. That's right, it looks like some 12 year old took Minecraft (an already novelty game in of itself), drowned it, stripped it of its meat, and left it with iPhone-level selections of bricks, ores, and wood. If Minecraft and DayZ had a son whose set of chromosomes are of abundant numbers, this would be the incinerated fecal matter that arose out of it's rectal orifice.  However, 10/10 would recommend sending this as a prank gift.

11500	&gt;Non laser guns are invisble. &gt;Blocks dont apear in the inventory. &gt;Zombies are invisble.  Wtf is going on dev team?
11501	Hi this is my review of CastleMinerZ. I came in wanting to like this game because I had a blast on the Xbox360 with it. I start out in a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ spawn and try to adjust my grapics because they look like a took a dog turd and rubed in in my face and puked up a game ( The graphics only adjust how you you can see). I find TONS of iron makeing weapons EASY to get and then 15mins later I have the LMG, UZI, Mosin, and my starting pistol and knife with 50 iron left. The game is way to easy when there is no mobs.  The mobs are a second thing, they will kill you over and over again. They walk to you slowly and then they charge and when they get near you they slow you down and â¥â¥â¥â¥ you head to toe. I rage quit because of skeletor runs beind be with a bow and shoots me from across the map.  I get on the endurance mode and its hell on earth. Right when I spawn a dragon shows up and kills me ( Dragons are super rare spawns). I respawn only to get â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ by zombies and killed again. Then I wrote this review.  My point is stay away from this game untill it gets more updates.
11502	the little brother of minecraft that will forever be in its shadow
11503	What are you guys playing? Iâm supposed to be playing Castle Miner Zâ¢ but this one player keeps kicking my â¥â¥â¥. Is it TheLegend27?! Yeah, TheLegend27. Who is the legend 27? Some say TheLegend27 is the first Castle Miner Zâ¢ player ever. Born from fire. I heard, TheLegend27 can hurl an anti dragon missile farther than a catapult. I heard TheLegend27 once defeated an undead dragon with a single blow. But the worst part is, just when you think youâre safe, just when you think you might escapeâ¦ WHAM!!! Just like that! collective gasps [iPhone Notification] What? No, no no no, no no no! [iPhone Notification] Thatâs impossible! âTheLegend27â has captured my castle mine! Mine too! Aw you guys, Iâm sure itâs not that bad. You have no idea what just happened. I might have some idea. Woman turns around, and powers her deviceâs screen, showing she is in fact TheLegend27
11504	  The name says it all. You don't even need to scroll down on the store page to decide if you want this or not. I wish I could refund the time I lost playing this piece of unoptomized, buggy, garbage game.
11505	Good God someone kill it with fire....
11506	 Castle Miner Z is just a copy of Minecraft and the only Difference is that this Game is much more cheaper and there are way not that much ways to build as in Minecraft. I don't even like Minecraft but certainly not Castle Miner Z! I can't really recommend this Game, you can try it but its a waste of money... 
11507	  possibly the worst thing ive ever played
11508	This game is a heap of garbage. If you enjoy this you are what is killing this hobby.
11509	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
11510	This game is like cancer what got aids. 9/11
11511	would rather stitch my penus to a ceiling fan than play this.
11512	  Honestly the worst game I have ever played. Not even worth my time if free.
11513	I'd rather drink bleach then spend another second in this dark depressing world of agony, please remove this game off of steam before i report to the police that this game encouraged me to kill my self.
11514	Ever wondered what hell looks like?  This.  Pack up your bags, its over. Question answered.
11515	What the f*ck did I just play.....  Pros:  I Killed a dragon with a hand gun.  Cons:  I don't even know what to say anymore...
11516	â¥â¥â¥â¥
11517	spent ages playing it and got all the achievements. ez.
11518	My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.
11519	I have to say, it's a great game and all but it was a lot more fun on the console. The textures are a lot different (Not saying that's a bad thing) and I think it's a lot harder to move around and do stuff. This game is sort of like Minecraft, but with a darker side.
11520	This game had some good ideas, but desperately needs restructured. I can see where it had potential, but in its current state it just made me want to mod a minecraft server.  At best, it is in a very early Dev state, but it would take a great deal of additonal content for that to be a redeeming fact.
11521	Watch this if your looking to buy this game don't just look at the thumbs down:  http://youtu.be/iaY4AAy922I 
11522	It is decent but I feel it needs to be updated, just like Minecraft and Terarria were.
11523	This game wants you to build castles but has no ladders in it. Ugh what a waste of money.
11524	I only got to play this game for about half an hour before it sarted acting up.First the loding takes forever, I had to reboot the game just to load a level.Now when I try to open the game I get a second black screen and then I'm back onto my desktop.Like what the actual â¥â¥â¥â¥.
11525	Best way to discribe the game is by saying this: Don't buy it, unless you're obsessed with blocks, zombies, skeletons and a annoying â¥â¥â¥ dragon.
11526	This is possibly the wrost game i have ever played, bought it for me and me mates, well we lasted 5mins
11527	*Sigh* So, This game, sucks.   CastleMiner Z  DONT buy this game, just trust me it sucks, Here's a list of PRO's and CON's.   CON's EVERY mob that spawn's will jump at your face and scare the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of you. The only efficient way to get ore's and progress is to walk 5000 block's. Its a waste of money.  AAAAaaaand i have no PRo's for this game so, yeah.
11528	Complete Minecraft ripoff, and its not even a good one
11529	The creators basically said screw updating this game and making it better.
11530	horrible game
11531	Have fun running this game at 25fps while getting penetrated by 6 zombies merged into a Zombie(6) death machine. Oh, and there's Dragons that come every 5 or so minutes. Have fun.
11532	this games need have some of the zombie/monsters nerfed. on easy i was killed (with full health) by some monster in two hits, one of those two hits was from behind, and due to the lack of there being any armor or run feature you cannot escape said two hit killing enemy.
11533	Despite all the reviews i decided to get this game because the videos looked cool, PLEASE dont make the same mistake i did this is the biggest crapfest i have ever had the displeasure of playing, with regular updates it may have improved but apparently support has gone for it. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY PEOPLE!
11534	All this game has are bugs.
11535	Well,what shall i say. It looks like Minecraft with Dragons and Guns but well its very shallow. And no one plays it Online so your stuck in Singleplayer. The biggest Problem is the way the Zombies are designed and how cheap its made in Generell You need to know,originaly this Game was sold on Xbox Live Arcade for 0,99 Cents.......  The Zombies spawn even inside your Cave-House when you digged yourself one. When they hit like 3x youre Dead,getting hit makes you slow and your screen gets all red making it hard to see. The amount of Crafting Recipes is low and many things just dont work like they should.  It was a rushed budget Production to get a Minecraft Clone to the Console asap,and for a PC user there is realy no Reason to play this over Minecraft,except when you realy cant spend the 20 Bucks Minecraft is asking.But be away you get what you pay for and the original price was 0,99 USD
11536	This game is the pure embodiment of potato.  Just no.
11537	A lousy game I hope I got for almost nothing as part of a bundle.
11538	I bought this game with low expectations, and it failed to meet even those.  Devs have apparently abandoned the game as well.
11539	TBH this game is pretty bad the aliens even with the most op weapon in the game takes forever to kill soon as you even get 2 on you, well you can't even move around so you die no matter what they need to fix a lot of stuff on this game to make it even close to worth wild so all the time to get the best game weapon is useless since it sucks and you can't even kill a alien with it....
11540	this game is down right terrible. who ever created this game should get brutally murdered because of his/her dumbass creations. everything may look as awesome as it looks, but in the nutshell, everything is just â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. you started out on a land next to a tower, a tower that doesnt do anything at all and it doesnt make any god damn sense. once youre in a mine, it takes FOREVER to find what you need the most is diamonds. but they are more rare than minecraft diamonds. and right after you get all that loot, then you get attacked by a zombie or natural things happen in the game and right before you try to get your stuff back. all your stuff is GONE! because they disappear too fast and its just that god damn ridiculous, and you shouldnt lose your stuff that fast not even on minecraft because its way more better than this garbage what you call 'castleminer Z' they should call it 'castleminer Zero' because of its stupidity and no good excuse for a horrorbile game like this. and also PUT A â¥â¥â¥â¥ING SPRINT BUTTON ON THIS GAME!!!!! the zombies are way too god damn FAST! and they jump HIGHER! RIDICULOUS!!!...or just slow them down for gods sake. if you want to make this horrible game more better than it usually is. put a god damn bed in it! because the night where all the zombies come out and you just have to sit there and wait till it passes or you just keep getting annoyingly killed by them easily. and you know what else. i think you just want to let the people buy this stupid game for money and thats all you care about. and right after you got all that god damn money, you wont even going to bother to update this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥. a person like me that i really want this game to be good, but its NOT! i thought it will be the best game that ive ever played once i first met it. but i guess i was just wrong, because of your dumbass creations screwed me over! and thanks to you. you made me addicted to this game. because you let people buy this game and after that, they shove it in their asses and they think its good, but its not because its â¥â¥â¥ cancer that it just gave me. but i couldnt stop shoving that damn game up my â¥â¥â¥ because of your ridiculous creations and thats the type of cancer you just gave me. so thanks ALOT! â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
11541	I'll tell people to buy this when they add a workshop until then.....nope
11542	keep crashing 
11543	WORST 5$ SPENT EVER!!!!! do not i repeat do not get this game. It is hard, lame, and it suckes ballz
11544	good in theory horible in reality
11545	this game is the worst thing ever. sinse i bought a 4 pack i can't refund it. and the game itself is so bad it hurts
11546	I had fun with this back on Xbox, but the game is bad. The textures are bad, the physics are easily the worst part of the game. And worst of all, it has been abandoned by the developer, it hasn't been updated in over a year and no word since. There is no direction to CastleMiner Z. I get what they are trying to do, but it doesn't work, because there isn't really a whole lot to do. Ok you have the best weapons and a really awful looking house of bloodstone. Now what? Shoot zombies? I mean, there's nothing to do. You could say 'why not just build â¥â¥â¥â¥?' because building isn't fun in CastleMiner Z. There is no water, Building blocks are extremely limited, There is no animals to breed, no exp to farm only 1 boss to fight, and there isn't much you get from killing it. The game is empty. Oh and there's no fov slider so if you like high fov, you're â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of luck. It used to be my favorite indie game on Xbox, but TBH I give it a 4/10 Underaverage. If you want a Minecraft Indie spin-off, go grab Total Miner: Forge when it releases on steam... If it ever does. Or get it on the 360 now, They are still updating and it's turning into an RPG which I am quite fond of.
11547	WTF EVERYTHING IN THE GAME IS INVISIBLE ALMOST THE DRAGONS ARE INVISIBLE THE ZOMBIES ARE HALF THE GUNS ARE AND A LOT OF BLOCKS THIS IS A PIECE OF CRAP THE XBOX VERSION IS BETTER I DEMAND A REFUND
11548	I personally think this is the worst game ive ever played. Says alot since ive played 'How do you Do it?'.
11549	9 year old me would have thought this game was the â¥â¥â¥â¥. This is why 9 year old me should have killed himself.
11550	Played this game on xbox and it was great. Saddly i assumed it would be just as good on the pc and I failed to look at the reviews.. Sad to see game developers put off shut a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ port just to make a quick buck.  Downloaded  started a game  spun in loads of circles  died  deleted
11551	So, i started playing this game when i was too poor for minecraft on xbox360, it was an ok little game to keep me busy... then i got minecraft and never picked this game back up again... on 360... One day i was browsing games on steam and i come across this little game again, i say 'haha, nope.' and go look for other stuff, i come to find out that my friends have it and play it sometimes, so one of them gifts it to me and i start it up on pc. oh dear god was that a mistake... the controlls are crap, i keep glitching through walls, why put in an option to change your mouse sensitivity if it does nothing? If you really want to get this game then get it on xbox360, at least it's free there. this game is not worth what it costs and is pretty much abandoned... it has some cool things like guns and dragons and an AWESOME sound track, but once you kill a few dragons and get a laser gun you will really see the turd behind the shield it made for its self. 4/10 It could have been so much better if the developers put more work into it. this is what a very new early access game should look like.
11552	Life sucks, and then you â¥â¥â¥â¥ing die.
11553	Crappy Xbox port; not recomended   4/10 -Kerrydeville
11554	this IS â¥â¥â¥â¥ GAME
11555	This game is not horribly bad but not good either. I don't get how it is cheaper on the Xbox when it is the same on the PC other then that it is a game mostly like all other voxel box games, there is one exeption however it gets increadibly difficult for no reason when you start it is easy then five or so minutes later you are swarmed by a army of the dead and get killed. One of my biggest issues is that exploration is not rewarded the further out you go the more will come to kill you and that just means death. Another issue is that this game has little to no biomes that all generate in the same pattern and really dont help you at all minus of course the ore mountain biome that seems to have ore for days while you get beat down by the army of the dead mentioned above. Now I am one for a challenge but only if its fun and rewarding while I have only played this game for 15 minutes I also played it on Xbox for about an hour and they seem like carbon copys of the same broken game.
11556	Horrible. All I have to say. This is not what a game should (or games today) should be, just a big rehash with no replay value.
11557	I hate this game. Enough said.
11558	NOT THE BEsT GaME.... really high sens skelletons spawn in your house and you can break rock with a sword O.o really dont legaluze marihuana
11559	not a very fun game
11560	With friends or not still boring game.You can build whatever you want block by block but it's really easy for zombies and dragons to destroy it and kill you.This game is bad developed for a non-free game.There are many same games just free to play.This just don't worth it.
11561	THIS GAME IS A COPY OF MC! AND ITS â¥â¥â¥â¥!
11562	I would rather chop my â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off and use it as a hammer then play this game again.
11563	this game is virtual vomit its not even worth $2
11564	This game is like putting a toothpick under your toenail and kicking a wall as hard as you can.
11565	this was â¥â¥â¥â¥ing wank
11566	Its like developing cancer but without the waiting
11567	Poorly designed game. Irritatingly mundane concept. Its got nothing going for it.
11568	Oh, this one's great, nothing like having to get your retinas replaced after five minute of playing this 'game.' Just to prove how bad this game is, there's Xbox 360 button prompts, regardless of what your using to control the game, YAY!
11569	It's a good game. But they need to fix the senstivity option and make the crafting little better. 7/10
11570	i bought this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ game then i asked for a refund, a day later the game was removed from my library but i still didnt get a refund, so basically i wasted $2.00......
11571	This game is a big â¥â¥â¥â¥
11572	Meh. If only the zombies where smarter. Oh well...
11573	This is a steaming pile of crap. The brightness setting just makes the screen whiter?! That is but only one of this games many, many flaws.
11574	It sucks â¥â¥â¥!!!
11575	THIS SUCKS SO HARD DONT BUY THIS M8's AT ALL âà² _à² 
11576	keeps crashing and says its still open 
11577	DO NOT BUY!!! Bought this game while bored tonight. Figured a game for under 5 with multi-player would be fun with friends for a bit. loaded up game started server killed by dragon in first 45 seconds respawn into a hole full of zombies can't survive more then 30 seconds. Worst 5 min of my life. DO NOT BUY!!!
11578	How do I delete game from my Steam Library? This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing atrocious.
11579	    KEEP TO MINECRAFT, AVOID THIS GAME  
11580	can anyone tell me how to refund?
11581	This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ the sensitivty sucks the controlls are â¥â¥â¥â¥ed and it's just bad in generall
11582	its bad give the money back 
11583	dragons at spawn
11584	Actaully the worst. Actually, I've never played something worse than this. It sucks.
11585	a HUGE fuhking ripoff of Minecraft. I've played minecraft, and it's better than this sh!t
11586	It is minecraft with guns, but worse. It leaves the same bad taste in your mouth just as it does when you brush your teeth and drink orange juice. It sucks â¥â¥â¥ from your â¥â¥â¥
11587	This game is very very bad. At first it's a funny kind of bad, and then it's an enraging bad.
11588	I call this the stench of regret.
11589	10/10
11590	i personally hate this game, i would get a refund on it,but i've had it for like a year i hate it because it feels like everywhere you turn there is something that wants to kill you also,really,a dragon spawns right at the start, it might be more expesive,but i recommend getting minecraft if you like this stuff(survival,sandbox,crafting)
11591	10 min to get all the best armor and gear should be free 
11592	I remember once stabbing myself in the leg showing off a knife to a friend. I remember the fear, the blood, the panic as I made a makeshift bandage out of a feminine napkin and tape.  I'd rather go through that again than play anymore of this game.
11593	It sucks. That is all I need to say. It's a Minecraft ripoff with N64-like graphics, unbalanced enemies and boring gameplay. Avoid it like the plague.
11594	Although this game CAN be fun with friends, it is not worth the price (and thats saying somthing). It's lacking in content, and the content that is there is ok at best. I've played this game for a bit on PC and alot more on X-Box 360 before I got a PC and I will say I realy enjoyed the time I played it on X-box but it only existed as a cheap, $2, minecraft clone for X-box untile minecraft X-box came out. It was fun when it was the closest thing to minecraft on the X-box live market and for the $2 is was definetly worth it. But that time has past and there is no reason it sould be on PC, ESPECIALY for $4. It was worth the origional $2 but thats all it's worth. So even though it's the best cheap minecraft clone, its still a cheap minecraft clone, so i can't recomend.
11595	First feeling?? Sick from that, especially that soundtrack and the enviroment is like stolen from minecraft. After four minutes running in the world(offline/survival mode), shooting weirdly shaped monsters, IÂ´ve been hit by the meteorite from nowhere..  Controls are aweful. (when you jump, you have feeling like you are frog) Only 5 online servers wich each server has only about 3 ppl playin.   My opinion? This game is worth it like 45 cents or less..
11596	Fun for a short amount of time, then gets boring rapidly. This game feels like an early access release, because it has hardly any content. There are vast, empty landscapes with nothing really worth searching for, other than an alien ship. The only thing you can do in the game, is kill zombies, make better weapons, and then kill zombies.
11597	Terrible Minecraft clone with guns and dragons, which you can mod into minecraft. WOULD NOT BE BAD, if it had mods, it does not, so the game is fun only with friends, and only on one play through.
11598	dony buy this cashgrab
11599	Take 80% of minecraft, 10 percent of counterstrike, 8 percent of skyrim, and 2 more percent from alot of various other games...  Throw them into unity and blend it all together, and you have...  A waste to money.  Not a single part of this is original. Literally not one.  Worlds are literally carbon copies of Minecraft ones, only there's a lighthouse to serve as a checkpoint. It's indestructible. Hell is like it is in Terraria, only you don't need to go far to get into it. Basically 50 Y levels down is a total drop into hell, pretty much. Hell has nearly no reason to exist, quite literally.  Dragons are in this from skyrim, Zombies are in this, skeletons too, that's all you'll have for enemies. Zombies kill you in three hits, Skeletons too, Dragons do so instantly. Hit detection is literally barebones. Damage is dealt before the proper time in the animations.  This game has less content than freaking StarForge for crying out loud. Starforge atleast has 4 tiers of tools, and even weaons of different types, and 4 tiers of armors, vehicles, blocks to create your bases with, and terminals to serve as faster crafting stations and a respawn in hte form of a bed... Even chest-like containers This game however has only 5 block types to craft, 4 tiers of tools, 4 tiers of 2 weapons, no crafting stations, 2 chest types, no armors, no vehicles.  Seriously. This game is literally Counter-Strike: Minecraft with 2% of the content, none of the mod support, no ability to make texture packs and easily install them and even swap between them... and all for the literal same price of Minecraft, or Terraria, take your pick.  This game, like Starforge is basically evidence that you can make money off of nothing but other people's hard work and that we need a Storefront Quality Control team.  Sure, there's a mode called Endurance where you don't save the world, and dying is permanent, but it serves no real purpose. It's just an obligatory 'Hard' difficulty.  Get Minecraft. This game, like Starforge, is a Crime against Gaming itself. Plagarism. The Devs need to learn what that is, and Steam too, due to it still being here.  The ONLY thing is has over Minecraft, is it's server browser.  This game isn't worth downloading, it isn't worth a dollar, it isn't worth even even one tenth of your dog's crap.  It isn't difficult and the game is designed by someone who is clearly not old enough to know what.  Final Note: This game has basically no reason to exist. Watching paint dry is more enjoyable and you'll be more likely to do it after buying.
11600	That game gave me a weird impression of a deja-vu.  Meh/10
11601	I remember being very drunk one night, and woke up with this game in my library. And it's not good.
11602	5 hours into Endurance.. game crashes... 10/10
11603	my mouse moves when im not even touching it! how do i fix this??
11604	Number of bugs and horrid mouse sensitivity controls makes this game hard to play. The title should stay on Xbox 360.
11605	Can't even load a damn world without the game crashing.
11606	This could be a great game, and I love the concept, but it has a very major issue that must be addressed before I deem it worth purchasing.  Zombie Mechanics I love a good swarm as much as the next guy, but this is a bit too much. They constantly spawn, even from the very start, giving you no time to get a decent chance. You do get a gun and 200 bullets, but the reload time is killer... literally. Buy the time you've reloaded, they're sprinting and jumping. And they spawn EVERYWHERE. Even if you've built a nice wall, they'll just spawn on/in it. I'll count the dragons as zombies, since some of them are undead. I think the dragons have way too much health for how early they spawn. These issues would probably be a lot easier to deal with, except that the sensitivity on its lowest is higher than that of most games at their highest. It is, however, nice to see that the devs have started doing things again, so at least it has that. It could be a ton of fun, so if you don't mind these issues, I would definitely recommend it.
11607	This has to be a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing joke
11608	only good anthing is creative mode.
11609	There were no castles to mine 0/10
11610	this is a pretty bad game. it straight up copied minecraft and added guns, and the developers are asssholes.  just about everything that can be said about this game has been said.
11611	A very poor game. Bad ballance, poor UI, menus and controls, Just a mindless copy of Minecraft cynically produced to try and make money off of people with the minimum of effort. You can't even crouch or run in this stupid thing! Graphics are very poor as well. Somehow, they managed to make a worse looking game than Minecraft.  Avoid this like crazy, and don't buy from this company ever. It is pretty obvious they are in this just to rip people off.
11612	Community is completely toxic, everyone is an â¥â¥â¥. Also hard to understand.
11613	This game is awful, don't want your money, I have a $2,600.00 Computer and this game is so HORRIBLY optimized that it lags. Whoever I paid for this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥, I want my money back, like today. This is not what I paid for. I don't pay for garbage.
11614	This game is a good classic on the Xbox 360, but on the computer, it is way too hard with the dragons and the skeletons and zombies. I would only reccomend this game if you have a good gaming PC that can run 1080p. Otherwise, i don't reccomend this game. The framerate has to be high to play it and the graphics on it aren't good at all. It's better to play it with friends because it will give you a more enjoyable time playing it, but it will also be very hard, but not as hard on solo.
11615	Although I didn't play extensivally, I would NOT recomend you to spend $3.99 on this game. It would be a waste.   Since i played it, there was nothing to do. Yes, there was the minecraft styled mining, weapon upgrading and dragon hunting. Summed up, a few hours of entertainment, that's if you don't die on respawn.   The game feels empty, boring and there's nothing to do. Good luck for those who just bought the game...
11616	what i played before the update that changed a lot it just not the same i liked the game but it seems shallow maybe becuse i play a lot of minecraft with mod or maybe becuse i really just don't like the way they whent with the game but it dose not seem that good now i say no but have a look maybe you will like it
11617	Can not join any online game.Not enough settings.
11618	Fun little game better on xbox but yeah we had a laugh!
11619	The game is not fun! not even worth a dollar 
11620	Not that good of a game, it is boring and repeatable forcing you to mine metals for the whole three or four minutes the day lasts in order to make ammo and then waste them on the endless army of zombies that comes out on the everlasting night. You can't really craft much other than weapons and the ingridients to make even medium tier weapons are pretty rare, forcing you to ambush and kill dragons hoping for a few diamonds among the loot drops.  Stacking blocks to make a building and putting in a box-chest or two, is the closest you can come to creating your base. There are no furniture or useful indoor items other than torches. Even with the best weapons the zombies or a bugged invisible demon will kill you. Suits of armor that reduce the damage you are receiving are not existent in this game so your survival depends on the gliched zombies falling from the sky and bouncing up and down non stop.  Killing the dragon or shooting the ground beneath a friend with a laser weapon to make him fall to his death is the only thing I found enjoyable in this game.
11621	go kill yourself/10 worst game ever on steam its boring and everything is a block wtf
11622	it was very underwhelming. I with i could get a refund
11623	Welp, Its terrible. That is all i need to say
11624	When this game was released on PC, I was hoping for more than a couple updates. We got the 1.7 update, adding a decent amount of stuff, but that's it, no more updates around a year later. The games price also dropped to $1.99, but sadly I bought it before hand. Digital DNA moved on to other projects, just after the struggle of getting this game on steam. It's a good game, but without friends to play it with, it gets real boring.
11625	Waste of money.. The game is boring..
11626	Besides lacking music and fun, this is a pitiful copy of minecraft but with guns.... and that`s it.
11627	Well, its not minecraft, but it is miney. Its not Z, but there are those too. Its got a dragon. Here lies an amazing concept delivered with the precision of a blind guy with a machine gun. A whole bunch of ideas tossed into an unforgiving, bland sandbox that basically hands the player a small gun and a pickaxe and just laughs...
11628	i tried to learch it but nothing comes up can somone help me 
11629	should not buy game same as minecraft
11630	Couldn't even get to the title screen because the game is riddled with bugs, I took many hours out of my life to try and get the game to work, but nothing. Another game to put in the section of the steam library, the section of always uninstalled.
11631	It's garbage. A sucky minecraft clone without any of the good things. Most of the positive reviews are jokes.
11632	Not worth more than the $1.99 it costs, I wouldn't have paid that much if I knew how rough this game was. ..
11633	I saw this game on my queue and say to myself 'Minecraft + CoD! that MUST be fun' - oh boy! was I wrong.  This game is AWFUL, so many glitches, it gets laggy for no reason at all (I was playing offline) you can't change settings, so every time I moved my mouse around it would go ballistic on me. On top of that, everytime I was trying to cut a piece of wood or something, the white 'smoke' coming out from it won't let me see a thing.  The concept was good but this seems like a beta never finished. ON TOP OF THAT you can get the game for free on the developer's website. 
11634	The game looked good at first and i thought it was good but the game needs much better graphics than what it has and the mouse sensitivity is terrible beacuase when i turned it down it didnt even change. The mouse seems really slippery too. if i was gonna buy this game i would wait untill its updated alot more.
11635	CastleMiner Z, its like DayZ and Minecraft had a baby and left it at a roadside for somone to adopt. It clearly shows that it wants to have fame for making a minecraft replaca and and adding zombies and aliens. plus its super buggy and not fun at all     3/10    ~BasketBaby
11636	Absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥.  I thought this would be kind of fun, but it's not. Particle effects are 5/100, music/sounds is absolute diarrhea, and graphics like this was before the PS2.
11637	The Xbox Live Indie Section in a nutshell.
11638	There is only one main issue I have with this game. However, the issue it pretty much game breaking.  Before I get to said issue let me say this: I DO enjoy the game. I had it on Xbox and when it died, I found it here and thought 'Awesome! Maybe it'll run even better on PC!' Boy was I WRONG.  So here is my only issue. I can't walk five steps in the game without feeling like Im having a damn spaz atack due to the grossly high sensitivity with the move. Just nudging my mouse will make me do a 180. Even when I have the sesitivity set to ZERO it does this! That alone (And if you're reading the other reviews, take them into consideration) makes the game unplayable for me. Devs, if you happen to read this, fix this issue please. Do that for me, and I'll play it again.
11639	I paid money for this. I start the game for the first time and within 15 seconds, i'm getting the â¥â¥â¥â¥ blown out of me left and right. I delete this world, start a new one. This time, my spawn sends me flying through the map. I love this game 10/10.
11640	If you like ripoffs of minecraft that cant even comeclose to minecraft this is for you
11641	This game just doesnt work or me. It has none of the charm of minecraft and the combat and crafting are mediocre at best. Might be fun multiplayer, but the few games I tried online were poorly populated with horribly rude people, so I am not the best judge of that. Some nice ideas in here but they fail to grab me. Meh...
11642	i regret taking a part in this game's giveaway
11643	so so the game was abondened but it still holds up a little 
11644	Wasted Hours upon hours of time on this stupid game. Playing endurance mode with friends and on several occasions hours into the game, someone gets disconnected for any number of reasons that may or may not be related to the game it's self. The annoying part is that this game mode has absolutely no save or reconnect ability. once the host's game crashes, or your laptop dies, or your internet disconnects, you loose all hope of finishing your game. PLEASE DEVELOPERS: allow an autosave feature for game crashes, allow players to Reconnect and have the same stuff as they did when they left.
11645	gave the game a chance, built a house, decided to go exploring. Found diamond, got really excited, and just as i got it i got caught in the clutches of a skeleton man. couldnt switch to my pistol fast enough, died in 3 hits, lost everything i worked for.  10/10 best uninstall simulator on steam
11646	Boring and creative u still die. Rip off and terrible. 0/10
11647	YOUR INVENTORY IS NOT SAVED WHEN YOU PLAY SO YOU UNDERSTAND it is still a great game but your inventory doesn't save after you quit they need to implement a save feature
11648	It would need something to bring more players. Can't really play with people because they have never heard of it. It has good gameplay, but if you like playing with otheres, this may be a problem to you.
11649	fun for a few hours with friends, would not play extended amounts of this game with or without friends.
11650	It works well, had no issues, and I recieved what I wanted. Yes, I am talking about the refund button. Thank you Steam for allowing me to refund this huge waste of $1.99.
11651	lied about updates and probably will till the end of time
11652	Never in my life have I played a game this awful. Whatever waste of time the developer put into this could have been used in so many other ways.
11653	Literally all you do in this game is build a stone base, make an iron pick, mine gold, make a gold pick, mind diamonds, make... well you get the point. Eventually you may be able to get a laser weapon and kill dragons. Thats it.
11654	Game is pretty bad
11655	Your are one of the most terrible developers, let's hope you'll never be able to pro- steal assets ever again.
11656	If you like hella cheap, glitchy versions of minecraft with much less time put into the actual production of the game, do it brah. Don't waste your money and time please. Please save me the troubled nights of sleep where I lay awake thinking about all of the poor souls who wasted a good $2.00 on this illegitimate excuse for a game.

11658	I still remember back in the day when me and all my friends would play this game for hours and hours because minecraft was not on the Xbox 360 and it was actually pretty good but only on Xbox. on pc im stuck at 30249324 sensitivity and dont have voice chat.
11659	Got boring.
11660	I have a hard time playing due to optimization issues, mouse smoothing and acceleration are absurdly high in the game and it doesn't have full controller compatibility for menu navigation and is just generally buggy. If you plan on playing the game which I do reccomend, play it on an Xbox 360 where it's properly optimized.
11661	literally the worst
11662	This game didnt bend the knee to the One and only king of Westeros
11663	Ive only had around 4 hours on this game. The multiplyer great, the guns are awesome, the graphics are quite nice in their own way, the mining part is better then other games. it is an incredible game for a very low $6:09 AUD. i would pay up to $25. There are some bad sides... just let me think... umm, i cant think of one, well, one, it needs to be updated more with more weapons and armor, beds, chairs or something. EDIT  Sorry i made review ages ago. this game never updates, its so â¥â¥â¥â¥ed.
11664	This is a game to play if you want a laggy mess of particles everywhere. So let me start out by saying i play alot of sandbox games. I played Edge of Space, Minecraft, Terraria, Roblox and more. but Castleminer Z...just wasnt that good. Yes i still would play it. But i would not recommend it. On multiplayer some players are just plain out rude and the last thing i need today is for an 8 year old to get this game join my server and start being offensive. But this game crashes alot...Now i dont mean your NORMAL alot i mean like full on F*ck no you cant play this alot. I cant even change the name of the servers i make. or it crashes. I find it very annoying that i would be trying to kill a dragon and i would crash....Like really fix the bugs.
11665	Please do yourself a favor, do not buy this game, it is a worthless minecraft clone that is in no way even comparible to minecraft in anyway. save yourself the agony and do not buy this game
11666	RECOMMENDED : Highly NOT (You shall not pass, run you fools)   Reasons : - Too fast cycling day/night not letting you time to build anything - Dragons can attack you since day 2 - Bad UI  Buy Creativerse instead it's 100% free, more polished, more deco, better experience in any ways.   http://store.steampowered.com/app/280790/   That's all.
11667	its better if your on shrooms
11668	not enough explosions
11669	Garbage source engine minecraft ripoff. Broken, buggy, and ugly as hell, probably full of stolen assets, don't waste a single cent on this developer.
11670	not worth even it's low price 
11671	It's fun, at first. But it's too easy. Within 45-60 minutes, I can get the best stuff in the game. It has a dying community and very little replay value to me. I'm sad that I spent money on it, and wish I hadn't. Although I do not recommend this game, that doesn't mean you shouldn't try it for yourself, as my opinion is exactly that. An opinion. If you like minecraft and want a bit less of a challenge, go ahead and buy this. Before I conclude this review, I do want to mention that the 2 biggest reasons I am not recommending this game is simply because of the playtime, and because it's community is basically dead. Everyone I've met who still plays either kicks me, griefs, or is just a huge jerk. (I'm avoiding a choice word.) I won't play it again, but if you've got spare change and want something to fill a bit of time, go ahead and give this a try.
11672	the wire season 13
11673	They say there is a graphic overhaul and new stuff, but honestly game is still broken as â¥â¥â¥â¥. They add stuff that no one cares about and don't bother fixing stuff that needs to be fixed. The new 'Graphics Overhaul' is a joke. You can't tell a difference between day 1 xbox release and this. (Its a direct port of an xbox game btw).   â¥â¥â¥â¥ the devs who don't listen and who want to ruin a game that is fun with friends, but you can't play much due to bugs.
11674	This game is the most cancerous thing you'll ever play but I have to admit that it's fun af with friends. And believe it or not, this game has the most rediculously good soundtrack out of any game I've ever played. I mean for real, it's like their entire budget went into this game's soundtrack. Please don't buy this or let your friends buy it for you. It's not worth it man, please don't do it. Just no.
11675	hated it &gt;=(
11676	This game is amoosing buy it today or die. Btw if you buy the game you will get cancer and every STD good luck.     Also my fav graphics card is the DirectX 9.0c or better with 1 GB memory
11677	the pictures arent even similar end my life please
11678	this game has a great uninstall button 10/10 would have a bad time again
11679	I tried and I just could not play this your better off playing Minecraft because this is a terrible rip off of it. Don't even buy this i was gifted this thank god i did not spend any money on this.
11680	horrivel
11681	So myself and a few friends were bored one night and wanted to try a game for under 5 that had multiplayer. It was a fantastic experience at the beginning but i feel like the end boss dragon might have appeared a little too soon. Maybe another 45 seconds would have really helped but I understand that 3 minutes is a long time already. other than that 10 out of 10.
11682	Zombies consantly spawn making the game hard, especially if you're doing 'endurance'. I would reccommend this game to people have have friends who would actually play with them. Other than that, if you're playing alone, you're already dead! Zombies take too much health away so 3 hits and you're done. Good luck playing an in-consistant game!
11683	My friend bought me this game and I still payed too much, would of rather bought a multistage sequential dipstick.
11684	a friend gifted this game, played for 26 mins and hit a 360 noscope at 25 FPS  11/8 would hit another 360 but instead of hitting a zombie this time a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dragon
11685	This game can be fun, sometimes it can not be. Don't expect it to be a perfect polished game like Minecraft.
11686	10/10
11687	I really enjoyed the Xbox 360 version. My problem with this one is that it keeps crashing every 30 mins. I can't even get the 'survive the night' acheivement because it always crashes before I can get it. I want to give this game a good rating due to enjoying the console version but I can't experience the game if I can't play it long enough to enjoy it.
11688	This game crashes after the robot woman shows. It sucks. I do not reccomend buying it for Windows 7. It's like the Menu music keeps playing after it crashes.
11689	Bought this game for myself and my son when he became obsessed with minecraft. Way because when it was 2 bucks, and basically abandoned as in hadn't been updated in over a year. We were both disappointed by the bare bones game, and broken features. We learned the hard way how to do quite a few things because of the lack of basic features. It has always felt like a cheap, quick minecraft clone to get people's attention, but lacked many basic features.  Fast forward to the past year and the price bumped up and small updates are being made on a monthly basis, however at any given time you are likely to find anywhere from 3-8 people in the multiplayer servers, and the majority of the time the only fun thing to do is to chase them down and shoot them repeatedly.  Having the game for well over a year and only having a few hours should tell you that I've had next to 0 interest in this one. You're better by staying with minecraft or the 50 other minecraft clones out there with actual non static models.
11690	It's okay for a discounted price, I guess...as long as you have friends to play with. 2 big issues. The game crashed and completely erased everything I had done. What a waste of time. But almost worse than that, I wondered why I hadn't gotten any achievements even though I had done them. Turns out, even though I paid for it, it says 'you don't own this game'. What?????
11691	Clunky interface and unvaried animations, lots of time waiting around. 'Extensive' research tree is really just a lot of the same incremental upgrades for your guns. Shooting segment quickly becomes repetitive which takes the fun out of blasting zombies. Maybe with more polish and some additional content this would be worth it but it seems that much more time was spent on polygon count than gameplay.
11692	Love zombies and enjoyed the squad top down elements of this and would have definately recommended it in the first 4 hours of gameplay. But with no storyline to push it along, after 12 hours, I have found this to be a repetative grind on several same maps of slightly increasing difficulty.   I have realised that I should have not invested research into the secondary weapon and simply should have researched the primary weapon up to the machine gun, also my strategic placement around the main map could have been more logical (would have saved money having to move helicopter positions). However, in all honesty I cannot be stuffed restarting the game and again grinding through all the same repetative maps. As it is, I cannot even be bothered finishing my current game.  There is simply way more interesting games to invest your time into.  Note to game developers - you need a story to keep a player interested, even if it's just some pictures with a voice over. Otherwise, what is the point of playing?
11693	It's fun but not really worth 10$+ it's fun to play the first two hours and than it just gets boaring and annoying, there is an android version for free and it is research and gamepay wise more fun than this one on steam.
11694	I have played UFO: series, X-COM: series, XCOM: series and many wanabe`s like Xenonauts, and have liked and disliked a lot about each series...This game is just a chaotic wanabe game that is more of a torture than a game. The UI interface is not friendly, the speed of the game is punishing and no way to pause and take a stock of what the hell is going on. I pressed `pause`, `p`, `space bar` but timer just kept going on and events were happening at overwhelming pace. Research, upgrades, they are all a mess. I just could not get a grip on this game. You probably have to be a hardcore gamer to be into this kind of a game. For a player like me who just wants to start a game and play it expecting the UI and game mechanics to make sense without having to go and Google for a help, this is not the game! The only thing that did make sense were ground battles! I cannot understand this chaotic mess of a game. Sadly.
11695	I want to play this game, however its key bindings are set up to be arrow keys and every time i try to change it to ASWD and space it defaults back to arrow keys. Looking in the forums this has been a problem since the game was released and all they've said is 'we'll look into it'. Well fix your â¥â¥â¥â¥ing games controls before selling it or make the default controls appeal to the majoirty which is right handed people. Basically the default controls are lefthanded and the game wont allow changes. the options available but it doesnt work, so unless youre left handed dont buy this game.
11696	  the fact that i lower the volume and it goes back up just makes it impossible to play... i tried several 'fixes' and 'tricks' and nothing solved it...
11697	To read my full review, visit MouseNJoypad;  http://mousenjoypad.com/reviews/pc/want-human-review/   Iâm not going to mince words- I did not enjoy my time with âI Want To Be Human.â Outside of the gameâs buggy and outdated gameplay, it lacks anything memorable or interesting enough to keep anyone's attention for very long. Sure, itâs quirky- but it's that kind of humor thatâs weird for cringy sake. If you can get past the poor controls and frustrating level design, there are plenty of fun battles to be had. Sadly, I canât recommend this game to anyone- it just feels far too amateurish, and itâs even more disappointing when I see the work this one-man team has put out before.
11698	  I review games for my website  Nardio.net . I recieved a free promotion key for I Want To Be Human a little while ago when we were covering games at Pax East. To see the review with pictures that go to the link below. The text of the review is below. I know this is a harsh review, but this a really bad game.    http://nardio.net/2016/05/24/want-human-review/   Is I Want To Be Human worth your time? No.         What should I play this on?  I played/endured this on a PC with an X-Box controller.      What Did We Think Without Spoiling It?  This is a let down. I Want To Be Human is just a bad platformer that sells for a comically high price. Even if the game were free I would hate it. Seeing it sell for $14.99 on Steam is mind blowing to me.      How it Plays and Why it Fails:   Bad game design.    I love action platformers. I love interesting art. I love energetic music. I Want To Be Human should be a darn insta-recommendation from me. I was really, really excited to play this game. When we received a promotional key for the game I was giddy. Sadly and honestly quite painfully, horrible level design knee caps the game. I Want To Be Human is painfully bad game all around.  Ugh.  This was a frustrating game to play and even more frustrating to try and like. I want to be Human is just a bad game. I know I already said that, but I feel like I canât say it enough. The art seemed really interesting when I first started it up, but soon enough the flaws started to make themselves known. Often times foreground visual junk totally obscures the on screen action. I know this happens a bit here an there in some games, but itâs taken to an unforgivable extreme here. You just cannot see some enemies that are attacking you on the ground. You canât even see yourself!   In areas like this itâs just about shooting and hoping you get the kill. I want to be human has more problems than just foreground clutter, but that is the last thing that bugged me before I decided to uninstall the game and give up on it. I Want To Be Human has so many problems I think it patching here and there canât fix it. This game needs to be taken down and totally rebuilt from the ground up. There is a good game in here I am sure, but itât covered and covered in problems.   Lets go into some of itâs problems shall well?   Cheap enemy placement. Randomized enemy projectiles. Bad level design. Bad aiming control on a game pad. Visual clutter and bad in game lighting makes platforming and finding enemies unnecessarily difficult. Stupid text bubbles that constantly appear from the players mouth that interfere with your view of the game. (CANâT SHUT THIS OFF!) Horrible bouncing camera. Way to much unnecessary screen shake. (CANâT SHUT THIS OFF!)   I Want To Be Human is just a bad game.    It feels like I Want To Be Human is the developerâs very first game. It feels as if the dev took every new technique they learned and over used it all for fun. Then decided to sell it without cleaning the game up at all. Mechanics, enemy placement, and overall game design seems to have no concern for the player playing the game. I donât think this was ever play tested. I Want To Be Human plays that badly. Why are text bubbles constantly coming from the character that blocks everything underneath it? Why canât I shut that off? Getting knocked off a cliff by enemy bullets I canât see because my character canât stop calling dead enemies eight year old insults is beyond stupid. This is not an issue that should be in a game that sells for this much. Heck this shouldnât happen at all ever in any game. That is just bad game design.  If you hate screen shake you are going to despise this game. Even if you donât have a problem with screen shake this will bother you. As I was playing/enduring this Jasmine (Who has no problem with screen shake) was watching me play and felt ill after a while. I Want To Be Human is really that painful and uncomfortable to watch.  I really tried to get into it, I completed several levels and spent over an hour playing it, but it never felt fun and the level design only gets more frustrating. I got this game for free as a review/promotional copy and I hated it. This is in no way shape or form worth the $14.99 asking price.   Donât get this game even if itâs free.

11750	I tried, o how i tried to love this game. 500 + hours of Dark Souls 1/2/3 games, loved every minute of getting wrecked in them. This game however, tries so hard to be Dark Souls, that it forgets what makes the Souls games awesome, a FAIR challenge.  In this game, rolling is busted and hardly works, there's no stat to increase HP, the controls are clunky and fail to give the player the required fast and crisp input to complete the gimmicky bosses and over-used platforming sections. Not to mention that most of the deaths in this game come from either missing a jump, and dying, or getting hit off a ledge and dying that way. Thats not fun at all, there are hardly any fun 1v1 enemy encounters, it's constantly throwing multiple enemies at you that stunlock you, or send you flying, becuase if anything touches you, you GO â¥â¥â¥â¥ING FLYING OFF THE SCREEN. Most enemies can 2 shot you, if there's 2 enemies on the screen, be sure as hell they will combo you around the screen like a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Super Smash game.   The main problem with this game is that there are too many arbitrary and artifical ways they make the game harder. 'Here, fight this boss on a series of crumbling ledges that also periodically shoot fire at you' this is the definition of a gimmicky boss, sure it takes some skill, but the amount of trial and error required to get passed some of these poorly designed encounters, leaves the player feeling frustrated even after a win. Everytime i beat a boss in a DS game for the 1st time, i was so happy at what i had just accomplished, knowing i just completed a difficult, but fair fight (barring some cheesy â¥â¥â¥ bosses in DS2 of course). Another issue is that the game also reduces your total amount of HP everytime you are hit, another artifical way to increase the difficulty, even with the ring which helps reduce the amount of HP lost from taking those hits, its still completely unnecesary. It just feels like the devs made the game to make players feel bad, 'hope you like fighting on ledges that 1 misstep and your dead while 5 enemies are constantly chasing you and archers are launching arrows at your face! isnt it great how hard our game is!?' Its like the game just laughs at you and doesn't respect the player like a Souls game, which always builds up the players skills, making every new area a fun new challenge that's teaching you the ropes at the same time as kicking your â¥â¥â¥.  In the end, i think if there was far less crushingly difficult platforming and less ledges/cliffs/holes in the ground, i would have maybe stuck it out (The controls certainly don't help). But im sick of trying my best in a given section, only to have a trash mob enemy hit me once, and throw me flying off a ledge to my death. The Souls-like mechanics are well done in some places, the way Salt(Souls) work, fat rolling, weapon/armour variation and the tech tree is OK for what it is, the atmosphere is nice as well, but the game severly lacks the balance from a Souls game. That is to say, the balance of difficulty vs frustration, which is what keeps the player playing, that feeling of 'Man, i got my â¥â¥â¥ kicked, but i totally made some mistakes, and i can do better', not 'Hey this boss will 2 shot me no matter what happens unless I play perfectly for the next 5 mins' and 'Why am i fighting 5 enemies on a bunch of narrow platforms, this is cheap and makes me feel bad!'.   Im a patient man, having just finished casually speedrunning DS3, beating Doom on Nightmare (which was hard as â¥â¥â¥â¥, but so fun!), but this game will test the patience of any gamer i can think of. Be wary of this game, as it will crush your soul so hard, youll boot up a Kane and Lynch game while cutting yourself for reprieve.  -Rebuff
11751	game is fairly buggy and doesn't seem as if it has been receiving any support since may. my introduction to the game was being killed by a marauder in the tutorial area who stopped having a hit box. have also had other issues such as my salt getting tied to inanimate objects on death that cannot be interacted with, a known and documented bug that has not been fixed.  has a lot of your bread-and-butter PC port nightmare problems. borderless windowed seems to occasionally have an issue with the task bar gets stuck on top of the window, which i haven't been able to figure out how to fix other than to restart the game completely. the game had different gamma on full screen when i first played, but after realizing the game was running at 1920 x 1080 instead o my native resolution (thx,) now it seems it only runs with a murky, low-contrast gamma (I -believe- this is the intended way it is supposed to look, but there are no brightness settings to alleviate the issue of feeling like I'm playing a game with cataracts. I don't care how dark and gritty your game is trying to be.)  I couldn't get co-op working with a keyboard at all. It would prompt P2 to press space bar, but pushing space did nothing. Other fun design flops are the fact that in the default keybinding, the inventory is bound to the escape key, but if you try to set P2's controls to copy the default for keyboard, you literally CAN'T bind the escape key because the escape key cancels the input for key binding. Genius! Never mind the fact that they key binds or button mapping you set up in single player *DOES NOT* transfer to co-op and you have to rebind everything. Annoying.  other than that, the game is simply trying way too hard to be dark souls (name checks out.) It is essentially 2D dark souls without they clean, readable animations and with a lazy 'hurp burp save the princess' canned story. The Souls games have excellent stories and lore, but I guess whoever wrote this one had no ideas other than perpetuating lazy damseling nonsense. there's a PoE / FFX-esque skill grid for level ups, but as far as I can tell it is only for mundane RPG stats. There's also very little explanation of what each stat does and you are left to infer, which while your basic 'strentgh' and associated stats are fairly straightforward, others would likely be a problem for people not familiar with a souls-type game (which it is largely copying by the letter.)  It's dark, it's gritty, it wants to be souls, and the game can bug out and you can lose all your not-souls with no change of getting them back because the developers don't bug fix the game. It's lack of inspiration would be maybe forgivable, but for as many problems as I've had with it and its evidently now-nonexistent supprt, I simply can't recommend it. For almost $20, you should just go buy Actual Dark Souls and play that instead.
11752	After spending hours of frustration in this game I finally beat the thing. Not at all a perfect game its rather lonely. The only way that I know of to play with other people is to have them in the room with you. Which is an impossibility. I couldn't find a guest option, if it even exists which I found no evidence off. Not being able to play with friends online hurts the game quite a bit.  The content is a mixed bag later on. Difficulty seems to be there mostly in leaps of faith. The community doesn't help much either as they'll tell you to jump just to troll you. Which early on I became sceptical of any help they might provite. Bosses range from painfully easy or extremely difficult. Do note that I played through the game as a squishy caster so it may very from play style to play style.  Magic was far too shallow for my tastes which honestly hurts a lot of games in my opinion. Salt and Sanctuary does away with having 4 virtually identical forms of magic just with different damage or a different color. Which was nice but didn't make up for how shallow it was.  Finding magic was an absolute nightmare. I had to look it up online to find a secret passage just to get my second spell. Since I started with a fireball. It shouldn't have been tucked away like that in the beginning. Having access to your first spells and a mage early on was key to my overall success and having novice spells tucked away on a secret place really harms this for me. Mind you, I don't mind questing for spells. I quite in joy it. But If I haven't even got my barrings in the game or know what I'm doing this is a rather poor decision.   The end of the game was built up to fairly well with the little bit of diolog scattered through the game. Although its not much of a surprise, if at all, I wont spoil it. The community of the game does that for you as soon as you step onto the beach. Although the note in a bottle are more Cryptic clues from the community, it did lead me to the final conclusion I would have come to on my own long before facing the last boss. Even with that gripe, I found the story to be just enough to keep me interested in the world we where in. Which is a plus.  Punishment for death seems a bit steap. Sure, losing all your salt to a boss and some gold seems okay, but I died 99% of the time to falling damage alone. The game is DARK! Not 'OMG, Like that's gross and stuff. You know, like Scary', well it is, but dark as in 'Where the heck am I going. I can't see a darn thing!'. Which becomes frustrating because it artifically pads out the game far longer than It really needs to be. You might thing that falling to my death is my own fault. A few times it absolutely was... But not the majority of the time. Most the time it was just remembering when and where to leap. I ended up just ignoring large chunks of lost salt because It absolutely wasn't worth the effort to find the bat that'd spawn then spend the next 5 minutes trying to kill the darn thing because its everything you hate about bats in most 3D games only with a monsterous amount of health.  Salt is used for everything. Just about. Armor, weapons, leveling. Which si fine. Having something else outside of normal experience seems fine to me. I can't really complain about that, its a bit different but not in a bad way.  The skill tree is an absolute mess with a tone of redundancy. It looks sloppy and it feels sloppy. Even after I got used to it I found it to be more of a chore to work with than actually fun. The passive bonuses you get from it replace what would be called Attributes or stats in other games which pads out the leveling even further. I feel like there must have been a cleaner way to create it. Although its not as bad as other games which tie spells into their trees it still wasn't a very pleasent experience. At least it didn't fall into the same trap of trivializing old spells. But the game does that for you anyway. Which I guess its not fair of me to judge that on since most RPGs seem to trivialize your early spells.  Athetically, there really isn't much I can say about the game. It fits for the theme. Some of the bosses looked really interesting and a few of the enimes where legitamently terrifying. Though the ones that where usually threatening didn't look that intimidating and the ones that looked trully nightmare enducing where push overs. I didn't care for the over all design of the game, baring a few boss and enemy designs I found particularly interesting.  The game was Bundled into the Metroidvania summer sale package. And I can't honstly say this is a good Metroidvania game. The returning to old Locations to unlock new things or find new items is all there, but progression is pretty locked on that and few sectret items you find actually change up how you go about exploring the world. I found myself just looking up how to get to the next boss because I got so tired of stumbling my way around in the dark I just wanted to get the game over with. Which isn't a good thing. Compared to other Metroidvania games exploring the world you are in shouldn't be a chore until you want to unlock 100% of everythign. And even then most that time looking for random upgrades, bits and bobbles should be fun and exciting. Salt and Sanctuary didn't capture that for me. I found myself despising the areas I was in more than looking forward to that next discovery.  I think for me, the major recomendation factor lies entirely with Multi Player and its magic system. Since It doesn't allow for online co-op and the magic system is still too shallow for me. There isn't honstly enough here for me to recommend based on my tastes alone.  If you like the Dark Souls type games and a cryptic story with a dark setting. You'll Probably love this game. If You're looking for a Metroidvania game or a Deeper skill system in your RPGs this game really isn't for you. And Since I'm in the latter camp, I can't recommend this game.
11753	**I just completed Salt and Sanctuary with 100% of the achievements earned and it took me about 30 hours. With that being said, I think that I've seen all that this game has to offer and I find it hard to recommend this game to others.**  This game clicked for me immediately from the moment that I started playing it. I defeated the optional tutorial boss after only a couple tries. The first boss is very powerful and can be difficult for a freshly created character to defeat. If you defeat the optional boss, you get some endgame upgrade materials and an achievement. This is similar to the opening for a Souls game and I just ignored that similarity at that time.  After the first few bosses and some quick salt farming, I found that the game had a very similar gameplay loop to Dark Souls. You kill some enemies, collect salt, level up, kill the boss and unlock a shortcut to a previous part of the game. This is imitation as a form of artless flattery. The game has a wonderful art design but it just copies the Souls series a little too closely.   After some time, you get the ability to place guides at your sanctuaries. These guides sell a horn consumable that you can use to teleport back to them. After returning to them, the Guides allow you teleport to any sanctuary your visited just by talking to them. This essentially invalidates the need to unlock all the shortcuts the game offers you. There's very little point to them and you get nothing like the relief and achievement you would feel unlocking a shortcut in Dark Souls.  After some significant gameplay progress, I found that there was just too many similarities to the Souls games in general. Too many npcs and game mechanics were just copy and paste with a name change. It started to feel less like homage and more like plagiarism. Even the end of the game has a choice much like the first Dark Souls and it made the finale less satisfying to me because of that fact.  The bosses have some issues as well. Because everything happens in 2D, it's just a matter of dodging through the boss and hitting them after they do an attack. I defeated almost all of the bosses on the first try. There was only a few at the end of the game that gave me some issues, and that was simply because they had homing projectile moves or grabs that did very high damage. If a boss was challenging, it felt like they were just cheap. There were very few unique boss mechanics, most of the bosses are just damage sponges. I can only recall a few bosses that required some thought and that was just because you were required to attack a spot that you wouldn't expect. One boss had minions attached to it you needed to defeat and another boss was a sentient weapon, the wielder was immune to damage.  The next issue I had was the platforming. The jumps throughout most of the game were reasonable but the final few levels required far too many blind faith jumps. In the end it was just a matter of killing yourself until you memorized what path the devs expected you to take. It seems like they should have just taken a break and finished these final levels with fresh eyes. They are rushed and filled with artificial difficulty.  The final thing that I'd like to point out is the music. It gets incredibly repetitive. It's very rare that I mute the music in a game. I had to do that with this one. The electric guitar felt out of place and I just got tired of hearing it. The boss fights use the same song until the last few fights at the end of the game. The sanctuary song never seems to change, it's always the same tune. The sounds in general were fine, except for one water dripping effect in caves that was very jarring and artificial.  In closing, I'd definitely recommend this game on sale for 50% or greater. There's no doubt a fan of Metroidvanias would get his/her money's worth out of it. But I really want to impress upon others that as a complete experience, from beginning to end, this game is a flawed gem. It's similar to the Souls series but in a way that I found to be less than enjoyable.
11754	Bosses quit being satisfying about 4 from the end. I didn't care for it as a Dark Souls fan. I didn't feel skillful when I won, only lucky.

11757	It's a great game with a great art style. but this was NOT optimized for keyboard and it shows. It almost requires a gamepad.
11758	Salt and Sanctuary is an exercise in tedium.   When you first start playing this game it feels very good. The graphics are great with a nice crisp art style, the combat animations are pretty nice, and movement is at a nice smooth pace.  Then you start making progress and realize it just doesn't work.  It's designed to mimic dark souls but the execution is just not there. Time and time again you will mis-judge a roll assuming you will make it through their legs only to get stuck and killed, and you will be falling to your death non stop the entire game. The controls are the hardest enemy in the game by far.  It also makes strange design choices with mana and fatigue that make the game more of a slog than it should be, as you have to routinely go back to a bonfire even if your hp is full because your stamina is a mess. And this happens frighteningly fast, especially if you use magic.   It's just not good. It has alot of promise and feels great when you start out, but quickly becomes just flat tedius and you will be begging for it to end after your 100th falling death.
11759	Good game with an ugly porting. Sometimes you can't click the icons, so you have to wait until it works again, or you have to click many many times, and it isn't even a solution that works for granted. This occurs when you are buying items or talking to NPCs (Trinket for example), and is so annoying, it's so clear that this version of the game wasn't tested enough. You can use arrow keys to get rid of this problem, but sometimes it doesn't work either, so the better solution i've found is to point at the icon and then press space; seriosuly, what's wrong with these icons? Also, the game's indications are wrong, a bad porting again, if you have to buy an item, the game will say to press B (X box key) in order to confirm, while you have to press space on PC. Even if these are minor inconvenients, they makes clear that the developers didn't pay much attention to the adaptation of this product.  The game is good and I like its style, but it's annoying to spend 5 minutes in order to purchase an item, just because the program doesn't recognize that i am clicking an icon. I hope they will resolve this. I'm downvoting the game, because even if i'm enjoying it, some problems have to be solved.
11760	  PROS   - Art style is pretty cool. - Sanctuary system allows you to create a base to suit your playstyle. - Skill tree is straightforward and effective.    CONS   - Unlike Dark Souls, which is hard but fair, this game is pretty unfair in its difficulty. - Skill tree provides no real sense of progression, as health increases with level. - Stamina bar drains in like two swings.  A lot of people compare this came to Dark Souls, and it's clear why. It's extremely obvious in it's inspirations. The game incorporates a lot of ideas from Dark Souls, but implements them very poorly. In Dark Souls, dying to a boss is mostly due to lack of skill. In Salt and Sanctuary, however, I found many of the mechanics, and the enemy and boss AI to be poorly programmed. Rolling is unreliable, and blocking is clunky. There's very little indication of the stat requirements of the gear you'll find. Many of the attempts to create difficulty has resulted in things such as enemies and bosses that don't let you get up after being knocked down. I really wanted to enjoy this game a lot, and honestly I do like it, but it could have been so much better.
11761	Coop is a bloody joke. Only player 1 can play with keyboard + mouse and the progression mechanic is straight out made up by a total crackpot. Why? Have a read.  A lot of items is inaccessible for the guest player (unique items, tier 4 crafting mats, skillpoint rewards) which is a joke. Alongside the fact that a lot of things to do not work as well as in the single player version (avatars often do not grab ledges, ladders, etc.) makes the co-op the most tedious thing especially as the progression mechanics (which is ret*rded) makes you play the entire game twice (once for each player), so nobody misses out something. Also, there are gamebreaking bugs when you play past certain points as a guest e.g. if you defeated certain bosses in co-op as guest and then go play your own campaign, keys that are needed to progress do not drop.   But why would you replay it for the guest player? Because, and that is by far the greatest issue of the coop, the guest is permanently punished by not receiving specific loot, which then is in turn also removed form his/her own campaign!  Example: Black pearls are essentially skill points, some of them you can find after beating bosses, lying around in staticly placed loot bags, but in co-op only the host gets it, the guest is punished and receives a miniscule amount of salt and a sh*tty item (the salt they gain is later on far less than 1% needed for next level). And now comes the real deal: if the guest now wants to make some progress in his own campaign, the lootbags containing these skill points are empty, already opened. So player 2 is not only punished in co-op but in turn also in his or her own campaign. WHAT IS THE F*CKING INCENTIVE TO PLAY CO-OP!?   This is the worst game design I have seen in ages and although it is a fair single-player game, the co-op is a joke and an insult. Even singleplayer punishes you for trying out certain weapons, there is literally a handful of viable builds, the rest is useless.  Best thing is, all of these are known issues, just look into the official wiki, and people are posting again and again about this BS in the forum and none of these genii of devs bothers. And all of these are months old. Very consumer friendly.   It's a solid singleplayer campaign, but if you are buying this for a co-op experience, get your hands off. Too many things broken and the devs are not doing squat for months! If you want to throw your money at people for this sh*t, you're welcome.    A lot of people seem to be downvoting this review for no obvious reason, especially as all these things can be found as problems on the net, I guess fanboying manifests in the reciprocal like ratio of negative reviews. _______  TL;DR   Broken-beyond-enjoyable-without-being-high co-op and average to bad mechanics in general. Looks nice in general, but after 20 or so hours in game, you will find it lacking as there is too much broken and there is little to no variety of boss mechanics, builds or anything, really.
11762	I want to like the game, but I just can't. I keep trying to, but I can't. its not a bad game but its a platformer that tries to take its roots in dark souls. that just doesnt work, there are too many things that are specific to a game like dark souls that dont work in a platformer. you get caught on enemies way too often and lose part of your max health because you cant roll through an attack if an enemy is closer than your roll distance. oh, that scumbag cleric pickpocket, patches was right clerics are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥... tiny boss areas was a huge complaint in the souls series, every time a boss arena was too small people complained, cough cough dark souls 2 cough cough but tight boss areas is a part of platformers.... what makes dark souls hard definitely makes salt and sanctuary hard, but what made dark souls fair just doesnt work as well in a platformer.
11763	TL;DR: A game following in Dark Souls' footsteps must have absolutely spot-on animations, timing, and enemy hitboxes. Those are sorely lacking and thus the gameplay falls apart.  Overall, Salt and Sanctuary has a solid premise with amazing potential.  Unfortunately, improper i-frame timing, poorly designed hitboxes, and enemies with no tells for nearly impossible-to-avoid attacks take 'difficult but fair' into 'difficult, and also totally unfair.' Coming from Dark Souls (a fair comparison - this game's mechanics are completely a carbon copy of Dark Souls mechanics), the game was not enjoyable because the precise and fine details required for Dark Souls - namely, well-constructed enemy hitboxes, fluid animations, and proper i-frame respect - appears shoddy and sloppy, making the game frustrating due to fighting the controls and bad coding more than due to difficult enemies.  I had such high hopes for this game. It seems those hopes were unjustified.
11764	I really wanted to like this game, but it doesn't let me. Already the start is really frustrating: the first optional boss shouldn't be possible to defeat for beginners and doesn't punish for losing, the story just continues, BUT the advantage of killing him is huge and he can't get fought again. So the player repeats and repeats and repeats creating a character, scrolling through the prolog and fighting his first enemies just to learn the one-and-only tactic to defeat the boss and has to hope that over this very long fight he doesn't make some strange jump which ruins all the effort with one-hit again. The first main boss isn't much less a fun-killer. In his second phase, sometimes he jumps over the whole arena, does his combo and doesn't let the player stand up again. One of the two currencies can't be much used until now, so the player just loses it without really a chance to save and invest it in sth. meaningful. The normal enemies aren't really a challenge, just hack&amp;slay. But they can reduce the players life when they're still invincible (because of an animation) and hit you. Just looking in the wiki and after some own first experience it's clear there isn't much to customize. The game is more action than roleplay, most is straight-line, at least when somebody don't want to fail terribly.  I can't understand all these positive reviews, it's more like souls-fanboys-hype. There's the usual problem with controls but additionally there're strange hitboxes, slight glitches and not really a story.  This game has a good concept, nice graphics, fitting sounds, but lacking the finishing touch. In its current state there's sadly more of unavoidable annoyance than a learnable difficulty.
11765	This is actually a decent game and I really want to like it but many parts of the game require more luck than skill, which is why I'm giving a thumbs down because this flaw makes the game tideuous and nearly impossible.  Just to clarify, I've played and finished some hard games, all the Souls games, old Castlevania and Mega Man games, Hagane and many more, but this one is so ridiculously unbalanced that it's just not fun to me at some points of the game.  While normal enemies aren't that hard to deal with, you'll encounter some more difficult big enemies here and there, which are still manageable though.  The real issue with this game are the bosses. Since it's 2D, you're limited in your ways of movement, which means that sometimes there is literally no way to dodge some of the boss attacks and some of them can kill you (almost) instantly. This has nothing to do with player skill and makes the game luck based and frustrating sometimes.  You have to be lucky enough for bosses not to do attacks that are impossible to dodge from where you are standing.  If you can get over that fact, you should be able to enjoy the game however. It's pretty much Dark Souls in 2D, only difference is that you level up in a skill tree rather than just boosting up stats.
11766	If you want to get this game because you liked Dark Souls, don't get it. If you like Castlevania or Metroid, get it. I don't like Castlevania nor Metroid, so I would not recommend it, but I guess I can see why people like S&amp;S.
11767	Like a 2D dark souls only not as good, not even close.   While Dark souls loves to give you a cheap death every now and then, That is all this game is capable of. Bosses are 'hard' because of small arenas or spamming the same attack over and over before your character can finish the recovery animation. Meanwhile the bosses with large arenas and slow attacks pose little to no challenge, and can be killed in one or two tries at most.  Pros: -Nice art style -Great soundtrack -Some how wasn't sued by from software for 'borrowing' almost every mechanic from the Dark souls series.  Cons: -Artificial difficulty -A convoluted 'Skill tree' -Not very original -No online co-op (WTF)  In short, just go play your favorite SOULS game.
11768	I love me some Dark Souls, but this game's battles come up far short. They use the same weapon for parrying as light attacks so you will often find yourself doing a useless parry when you want to get in a quick jab after blocking an attack.   Also many enemies are cheap. In Dark Souls when something went wrong it was your fault, it wasn't that a giant enemy decided to do a giant attack that you cannot roll out of, dodge and groups of enemies will spam attacks with no time inbetween for you to counter.  Those are my big complaints, there are other smaller issues, the lore seems dull and lazy, the art looks junky and washed out, the mechanics are unexplained (and while that's true in Dark Souls, Dark Souls made me invested enough to learn those systems instead of just giving up.)
11769	Looking like Dark Souls â  being Dark Souls.  Sadly, I must confess that the game falls short of what it tries to be; a fair and manageable 2D Dark Souls. I use the word 'manageable' because what turns this review into the negatives all has to with poor gameplay:  The good: - Decent Dark Souls-like atmosphere - Nice music  The bad: - Lack of decent i-frames - Sloppy input registration - Shoddy timing - Badly designed hitboxes - Enemies with no tells for unavoidable one-hit-kills - Non-fluid animations - No wake-up action (can't roll/block as soon as you get up) - And the list goes on, but I'm gonna stop here for brevity  All of this makes the game frustrating due to fighting the controls and bad coding more than anything resembling a fair fight. Trying to string together hits turns the combat into - dare I say it - a salty experience. Button presses not registering makes it difficult to queue hits or rolls. React 0.02 milliseconds too fast for the extremely narrow window, and your character doesn't perform the action at all. Imagine Tekken, Street Fighter, or Dark Souls forcing you to wait until the hand from the first move retracted all the way back before you could activate another action? Good luck stringing together combos.  While trying to make a 2D-souls is a commendable effort, the QA was skipped in full and it shows. I'll return if the developers revamps the controls. For now, I can't bring myself to pick it up again, as the worst controls this side of NES Rygar-jumping makes it intolerable on a KarTRASHian level.
11770	I don't get the praise this recieved... the controls are awful.
11771	Great concept and overall game layout and thanks for Linux client. But it is plagued by poor, slow, unresponsive, clunky and awkward controls. Really, this game should be turn-based. I hate turn-based games...but it's certainly not twitch-based unless your twitches have the delay expectancy of a sea sponge. Pass.
11772	If you enjoy frustrating hitboxes - play this game. If you, like me, can't deal when boss puts small metal non-magical rod into a place that is 2 meters in front of him and you take damage while being behind the boss - uninstall and never come again.
11773	This is a rather tough review to write. This game is a frustrating one; not from it's difficulty, but from the many aspects it falls just short of. I'll do my best to explain those aspects throughout my review.  As a die-hard fan of the Souls series, I thought that I'd check this game out. This game does a great job of emulating the general Dark Souls-esque gameplay to 2D. As with the Souls series, the game is difficult. This game also shares the steep-learning curve that, once mastered, can make the game less difficult or even menial in some places.  The game does stray from Souls style gameplay by having an overall more agile player character. Later in the game the character picks up dashing and wall jumping, something not in Dark Souls. By having the Souls gameplay in a faster, 2D format, the game seems like a pretty good one. When delving into it, however, its flaws begin to show.  The game has platforming elements. Perhaps I was misinformed, or perhaps I was unaware, but I didn't expect this much platforming. I don't mind platforming, and I fairly enjoy games such as Mario or Super Meat Boy, but the platforming in Salt and Sanctuary frustrates me more than those two games. The beginning has little platforming, but it gradually ramps up throughout the game. I appreciate the smooth curve of platforming, but unfortunately, this platforming makes heading through the levels to either getting to your salt or return to a boss frustrating. By the time you get to the Pitchwoods or Crypt of Dead Gods, the entire level seems to focus on platforming. The levels become increasingly scarce of enemies, and your biggest threat becomes falling rather than death from an enemy. A better approach to this might be to tone down the platforming in the end levels while increasing the enemy count, to make it less tedious and more exciting.  Armor in the game seems to be nearly worthless. In the Murdiella Mal fight, I switched armor sets multiple times each with different resistances and weights, but no matter what set or combination I chose, the difference in damage recieved didn't seem to matter. I have tested this numerous times and it still seems to point to a minor difference in wearing armor and not wearing armor. I don't like that having no armor is clearly the best solution, rather than the game striking a balance between an armored character, and an agile character.  The various parallels between Souls and Salt and Sanctuary also frustrate me. I understand the game is inspired by Dark Souls but a lot of the features in this game have a direct equivalent in the Souls universe. Sanctuaries are Bonfires, Replenishing Healing Items are Estus, Creeds are Covenants, Upgrading is the same, and the list goes on. While this game has features that make it unique, I find that these are few and far between.  Some bosses have attacks that are one-hit KO's. I can handle one-hit attacks, but when the boss pins me to the wall and he's too big to roll through, I can't escape. Too often have I been almost done with a boss, only for them to throw out the OHKO move.  This isn't to say the game doesn't have positive features. As I've said before, the game does an excellent job of emulating the Souls series to 2D and it does an ok job at adding some unique features into the mix. This game is slightly more forgiving than Dark Souls, but that's a personal positive. The lore is also interesting, if not scarce. The 18 hour campaign is definitely worth the price.  Those are my main pros and cons of Salt and Sanctuary. I wish there was an alternative third option to the binary system on Steam because this is a game that would frustrate and â¥â¥â¥â¥ off a certain audience, and pleasure another. It also has the uncanny ability to do both to me. Salt and Sanctuary is frustrating because it's a game that I can complain about all day, but I'll be playing it again anyway.
11774	I have played all three Dark Souls, and I rarely next to never thought that my deaths were a cause of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game design. You can see where I am going with this. This game may try to avoid this, but half the time you are going to die because of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ key bindings (yes, I did rebind them) and the other half you will die from the dodge function being next to useless. I have never been this frustrated with a souls game before. If you are planning on buying this game, please note that it was made by triple amputee's or aliens where the concept of a hand is all but known to them.  tl:dr Have you ever tried playing Dark Souls on keyboard? Yeah, that controls better than this game.
11775	If you're a fan of Dark Souls and that's what drew you to this game, you will be dissapointed. Salt and Sanctuary is not only not like Dark Souls(I have near 400 hours logged between the three titles, so I'm not speaking out of my â¥â¥â¥), but kind of a bad game in general.  1: Literally the hardest thing about this game is the contrast. You cannot, under any circumstances, see â¥â¥â¥â¥. The grey enemies blend into the grey backround alongside the grey interactable objects. Fun. It's actually easier to see underground because then enemies are highlighted against black backrounds instead of the entire â¥â¥â¥â¥ing screen being greyscale.  2: Turns out platforming and Souls don't mix; you can't dodge in midair(at least they don't tell you how), and many enemies can simply swat you out of the air. The rolling is awkward as hell, there is collision by default and rolling allows you to pass through enemies, but only during certain frames, making it easy to roll gently to an enemy's feet ready to get smacked with a counterhit.  3: Enemies aren't hard to kill, usually, but they have this annoying thing where every single move is stupidly under-telegraphed(if you can physically see the enemy model that is) so you can't just organically dodge.  4: Confusing, overwhelming skill tree.   5: Overly simplified combat. Not even rolling attacks.  6: No bloodstains, dying to an enemy buffs them and forces you to fight them for you lunch money. Great.  7: The most difficult enemy in the game is the controls. The camera also likes to do whatever it wants sometimes, too. The game as a whole is way faster in every aspect that it should be, so it ends up being hard to follow and difficult to learn from your mistakes.  All in all, pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ adventure platformer with unclever rip-offs of souls mechanics that's most difficult elements are the lack of any color whatsoever and â¥â¥â¥â¥ moving as fast as Sonic Boom. I'm fairly certain I had a better time playing Cat Mario. 
11776	I'm a huge fan of the Dark Souls series. This game is basically 2D Dark Souls... that's pretty much it. I wouldn't say it is a rip off, but it is heavily influenced by it. It's very impressive that a two person development team created this game, but it fell a bit flat for me.   My main complaint is that I don't think the 3D combat of Dark Souls translates very well to 2D. This is most apparent in boss fights. In Dark Souls, you can dodgeroll left/right/forward/backward from a boss. In Salt and Sanctuary, you can only roll left and right. Of course, the bosses' attacks are all 2D as well. But I found this cumbersome and some boss attacks felt unavoidable.   I also found it difficult at times to distinguish enemies from the backgrounds.   It's not all bad -- I certainly had some fun with it. But the more that I played this Dark Souls-esque game, the more I realized that I'd rather play Dark Souls.
11777	Really enjoyed the first few areas, then got to Watching Woods and started falling through platforms. Not even the platforms that are supposed to break, though I fell through those prematurely as well, the static platforms' geometry sometimes ended before their texture resulting in me many times walking where I thought was safe then falling to my death.  Persisted to Red Hall of Cages where I encountered really bad enemy hitboxes and an extremely spammy boss that was based around that bad platforming I just mentioned. At this point I also felt under-leveled despite being level 40 and having a level 5 weapon. Everything felt like it had an unfair advantage over me. Like they didn't have to follow the same rules I did.  I recognize I am in the minorty in this thread so people are finding the good in it and that is great. I just wasn't having any fun playing it. I love a good challenge, I've put a lot of time into the Souls series, but they have always felt fair. S&amp;S in my opinion does not.
11778	The game is cool at first. It's like 2d dark souls and has an interesting plot to it. The lore is fun to read up on and I loved finding new items to use. Unfortunately the controls are subpar at best and I find myself doing the wrong thing not too often, but often enough to kill me at key moments which is annoying. On top of that the platforming elements are overused and just not fun to play with. No one likes to die from fall damage because you jumped early after killing a slew of difficult enemies, it's stupid and not good game design. Especially when the platforming is as overused and obnoxious as it is in the late game. On top of that enemy design is sort of a pain in the â¥â¥â¥. With only 2 dimensions they had to innovate or the combat wouldn't be very fun. Unfortunately innovation means a ton of annoying to deal with enemies that fly through walls, teleport, jump insane distances, and knock you thirty feet away and off a cliff to your death. I'd say this game definitely isn't worth the 20 dollars you'll spend on it and isn't even worth 10 dollars. Especially with some of the bugs still present in the game that will deprive you of your 'salt' and how you can easily die from stupid things.
11779	Don't get me wrong, I love this game. It is fun, and all that jaz. But when your fighting a boss, and it's attacks do not do the same thing, or even close to the same thing, then the whole point of the game kinda falls apart. I am mostly referncing at the cyclops boss here. He has a jump attack, one of his attacks you are to roll behind, but 1/2 of the time he does it, he flies past me, easy to dodge. The other 1/2 he jumps at me, same attack, I can't roll past, and get a face full of axe.   Like I said, it's a fun game, but it's a game of skill. The fact that I have to worry if I might roll past this time if I am lucky, or if I might not and end up dying, defets the full purpous of this game.
11780	Refunded the game after just around an hour, writing this more to warn my friends away from it, but you might benefit from it too.  - Controls are unresponsive, to the point that this felt like a bad Newsgrounds flash game from 2001.  - Dodge is a crapshoot. You're just as likely to roll into a boss's crotch and playfully tickle their junk as you are dodge through them. As a result victory or defeat feels entirely based on luck rather than skill.  - Apparently Ska Studios thinks 'atmosphere' means everything must be gray. Background? Gray. Foreground fog effect? Gray. Enemies? Gray. As you might imagine, this creates a problem beyond just looking washed out and boring; there are points where it is difficult to see enemies through all that gray.  - Over-wrought skill tree. Almost as bad as Path of Exile.  - No in-game explanation of stats, or at least none that I could discover. There's a difference between letting players figure things out on their own and abeing deliberately ambiguous. This game is on the wrong side of that line.
11781	I'm a die-hard Dark Souls fan. I can appreciate the effort made to pay homage to that, but this game doesn't pull it off as well. This shouldn't come off as a huge surprise.  Often in Dark Souls when you die, it's because you made a mistake. This isn't always the case in this game, with some deaths just being out-right cheap.  If you enjoy Souls/Metroidvania games, I'd say pick this one up during some kind of sale.
11782	This game have some good mechanics but it just doesn't work together well enough. Its 2D game. You can't just put 3d mechanics from Dark Souls and hope its worked.  For example: This game have 80% gray colored locations witch means you can't remember all things you miss,  And game have no map... Just try to play Castlevania Symphony of the Night without map, its impossible.  S&amp;S have hidden walls witch can't be detected completely. The only way to find them is to attack every wall on your way.  1. Enemies also colored mostly in grey so you can't see them good enought. And they tend to spawn right near you.  2. Weapons broken. Arming sword has same reach as spears, or maybe longer. Starting weapons very weak, in Dark Souls you can use your starting weapon till the end of the game and its not difficult.  Example: Starting Knights Sword in S&amp;S deal 8-10 dmg to first boss, morning star 20. Swords and daggers are very weak. (Two-Handed sword like Claymore are pretty powerful.)  3. Enemies are extreme in all sense:   Some have very far reach even if it seems that they don't.   Some of them very fast, if get close to axe-thrower guy you dead. He just make 4-5 hit combo in second.  Some of them can grab you dealing lots of damage. They can grab you through shields. Grab attacks have huge hitbox so you can only dodge it to avoid it completely.  All of them can spam attacks without cooldown. So boss fight are heavy RNG dependent. It is not hard to memorise attacks but bosses can f_ck you up realy easy by just spaming exact same attack over and over again.  And bosses and some mobs can deal damage up to 90% of your health with one hit.  4. Skill tree. Why potions upgrades and higher class equipment unlocks are in tree?  If you take away these nodes from tree, the tree becomes empty. It has only stats upgrades left in it. All that makes player to stop experiment with different weapons. If you take Axes you cant just take a dagger and try it, instead you need to refund passives or start new character.  5. The game just wants you to die as many times as possible. Its hard but in unfair way. Some people like it but its not what make Dark Souls such a great game. Yes the Dark Souls was hard, but you learned and become better. In S&amp;S you die in trap becouse you didn't see it, memorise it, come back and die on another trap. Repeat till you finish the game.  6. There is some little bugs.   Example: If you die from poison there is a chance to not being able to recover salt (souls).    Overall this game misses some 2d features witch can improve gameplay.  a) Watching below character is needed since you can die from fall damage.  b) Character mus be able to duck.  c) The Map - must have.  d) Replace rolling to dash.  e) Fix reach of some weapons and enemies.  f) Get rid of the Tree of Skill because it doesn't have skills... Or add 'actuall' skills in tree.  This game have such potential but it just trying to â¥â¥â¥â¥ me off.   Thanks for reading. Sory for my bad English.
11783	Just wait for it to go on sale.  Will eventually put up a decent review but at the current moment it stands as such:  First 5-10 hours: Having a ton of fun etc. Despite cliche even if straight forward NPC's  Remaining hours: Jesus Christ so much platforming, and someone for the love of god teach that guitarist a new song. And also take in the magicalness that is Narwhal Unicorns 1-shotting you as no lie, I played 'Narwhals Narwhals swimming in the ocean.' on various occasions when I was impaled by one. And I only laughed my â¥â¥â¥ off because my mind broke after losing 45k salt to one of them.    Help me. 
11784	I really wanted to like Salt and Sanctuary, a Dark Souls/castlevania mash up with awesome indie graphics, and i guess i did enjoy the first 7 or 8 hours, but after a while I just felt no desire to continue playing. I guess I prefer more action -packed 2d games, like metroid on the snes, or games like Dust, where you don't have to manage a stamina bar, and the combat is much faster and more fluid. Salt and Sanctuary just started to feel like a chore...  Now, this game is a great achievment for such a small studio. I loved the indie style graphics, and the lighting effects are really atmospheric. It also has a brilliant inter-connected world design which has you unloking shortcuts all the time and bringing you back to new areas with new skills to unlock secrets. It also expands on the Dark Souls legacy in novel and interesting ways, such as having your convenant effect the sanctuaries (bonefires) and being able to offer statues found in the game at your sanctuary in order to summon merchants and such. It also has a really cool skill tree that reminded me of the one in Final Fantasy X. So there's lots of great stuff about this game, just not my cup of tea.   and I see from the Steam reviews that a lot of ppl like it, but for me it just became more and more infuriating and less and les of a joy to play and this is someone whose sunk around 300 ish hours into the dark souls games. Maybe I shouls have persevered, but for now i'm gonna let this one rest.   Now, before all the fan boys and girls get their knickers in a twist, I'm not saying this is a bad game, but i can't recommend it as I got bored of it really quickly. Again, not saying it is a bad game, and really wish i could like it more
11785	Disclaimer - I am not a fan of platforming genre. Maybe people who really enjoy it would think of this game higher, than I do. I picked up Salt and Sanctuary because I'am a big fan of Dark Souls series. I think it will be more honest if I start with the things I liked about this game.  And to tell you the truth, it is almost everything. Fights, bosses, enemies, atmosphere. Everything is really captivating. On a level significantly higher than what you would expect from a non triple A game. Fighting system is a bit repetitve,and bosses begin to seem all the same after a few of them, but in which Souls-like game they are not? On the other hand, figthting is varied, offers you a lot of styles and meaningfull choices. Right my alley, I would say. Soundtrack is great. Also a bit repetitve, but still really enjoyable. Atmosphere - let's just say whis game would be a great succsessor to the Demon Souls atmosphere, although a bit more grim. Now, for a few negative sides of the game... There are generally two big issues that I feel ruined this game for me, and made ne unable to enjoy everything else. 1) Many enemies are created without even a bit of thought about counterplay in them (namely, Horsemen, Angsty bones, Invisible guys and many. many others)  They are made to be annoying, not to be interesting or challenging.  Their abilities are just not fun to play against. It's not that they are too hard quite contrary - they are just don't serve as learning experience or require special techniques to overcome. Wouldn't it be better to design enemies, whose abilities would be fun although challenging to counter? 2) Platforming. Just... When I play this game, I always remember Prince of Persia, both Sands of time-warriors withtin, and 2D ones - 1 and 2. I think about those because many of the things that are bogging down this game are already fixed there. How many times did I fall to my death in Salt and Sanctuary because I just bounced off from platform, instead of grappling on it? How many times I fell through the elevator without any apparent reason? How many times I had to not even try going for the pitfall, hust because that ment that I would have to run back here from Sanctuary? Many.  Too much for my liking. Why couldn't I just try this jump, and then turn back time (PoP or Braid style)? Why do I have problems with grabbing onto platform edges so much?  Especial in Haggers cavern. A couple of times, I just had to stay on one place and jump there for a minute, trying and trying again to reach the edge of the platform just couble of inches from my head...  Ultimately, for the main question of a platformer is how you deal with punishing players errors. Braid, Prince of Persia, Super Meat Boy - all these games were trying to minimise the impact, which single failed jump may have on your game overall, while also teaching you to play better. Is maximizing the punishment fro failed jump a good idea? Is running back from the sanctuary because of failed jump worth it? I don't know. Not for me, it seems. Dark souls souls-lost-on-death system is in my opinion doesn't play well with platforming. If you remember Iaito jump in DS1 or jump for Ostravas shield and sword in tower of Latria - take this, multiply it by ten hundred, and throw it, distibuted evenely, in the game. This is Salt and sanctuary in the nut shell. Also this is magnified by somewhat glitchy and unresponsive platforming, especially in the Hard Light brand parts.  tl;dr Great game, buried under endless boring and infuriating platforming.
11786	This game tries really, REALLY hard to be Dark Souls. It has a lot of the same basic systems that the Souls series has. The game follows a lot of the same design decisions that the Souls games, but missed some opportunities to improve in areas. The game doesn't really tell you how anything works. You also basically have to commit to a build instead of really being able to experiment at all, since you have to spend your levels into a talent grid, similar to what you would find in Final Fantasy 10 or Path or Exile, and they tend to put different playstyles about as far away as they can from each other. You can refund some points, but you have to find items to do so, and there are only about 20 of them per playthrough so far as I am aware.   Combat feels kind of slow and clunky.   Rolling exists, but the hitboxes can be kind of weird. Also, there are different tiers of rolling, similar to the Souls series, where the closer you are to the encumbrance cap, the less effective rolling is. This makes wearing heavy armor and trying to roll expensive in terms of stat points, since you are going to have to heavily invest in your carrying capacity.   Taking damage reduces your maximum health, so getting more potions isn't really effective, since by the time that you could use all of them your health will be at a point to where you will be killed in one hit anyway.   Magic seems useful, but is somewhat inconvenient to use. There is no lock-on system, so casting it in any direction other than straight ahead is kind of fiddly. Casting spells also reduces your maximum stamina. You can recover this 'fatigue' through the use of potions that you have to spec into.  Melee has a limited combo system similar to what you would find in old beat-em-ups, you will do some different combos depending on what order you hain you heavy and light attacks in. There only seems to be about 5 different combos per weapon types however. There are currently 16 different weapon types, including staves and wands for casting spells, so there is a variety of weapons that you can use. Each weapon talent path also contains a couple of different types of weapons, such as spears, scythes, and poleaxes, so you have some room to switch between a couple of one type doesn't suit you. Parrying exists, but doesn't seem to serve much of a point. Most of the enemies that you would want to parry, including bosses, aren't parry-able. Most of the normal enemies I can kill in one hit, so no point in trying to parry them. At least the parry animations look cool.   Bosses are fairly interesting. They aren't just larger versions of the normal enemies that you fight. Each one generally has a couple of attacks that it will use at the start of the fight. Once you get it to around half health however, it will pick up a new attack or two and start chaining its earlier attacks together. One of the larger problems with them though, is once they do hit the point where they start using new attacks, is that they start spamming them pretty much nonstop, not really leaving you with any room to get in any hits. Also, since most of the bosses are quite large, the character has some trouble trying to roll though attacks/models, and tends to roll in place and take a hit or two instead. Which you generally tend to die afterward, since the potions heal over time, and most of the boss attacks tend to be long, sweeping attacks and hit almost the entire arena.   Overall it seems like they had a pretty good game, and then they added a lot of 'featuresâ in order to make it 'challenging', while instead all it does it make the game tedious to play. It doesn't feel difficult, it feels cheap. I don't really feel victorious after beating a boss, I feel like I managed to avoid getting cheesed.  I really wanted to like the game, and maybe I will get to a point where I will start enjoying it more, but as it stands I would just rather be playing one of the Souls games.  
11787	Alright this is my 3rd attempt at writing a review, after calming down and thinking about my experience.  Is the game good? Yes, i suppose, mechanically. Is it fun? No. Not at all - therefore i cannot recommend it. Whilst the art style is very pretty, polished to perfection, and the game is mechanically sound, it is not enjoyable. Here's a few reasons why  [edit] just gonna preface this with the fact that, according to steam, I've played 241 hrs of dark souls 1, 431 hrs of ds2, 49 hrs of ds2: SotFS and 164 hrs of dark souls 3. (Thats 885 hrs of dark souls franchise). I've played a lot of dark souls games. I know how to learn patterns, find pathways, learn game mechanics myself etc etc. So I hope you can trust me when I make comparisons between this game and the souls franchise, and conclude that this game is not fun.    Platforming
11788	i really want to love this game but 2d dark souls was a bad idea. bosses spaming their attacks and has a really poor movesets, rolls works like piece of garbage sometimes u can't roll between legs of the boss and he start spaming their attacks at you, enemy AI is poor too, talent tree give access only for new type of armour/weapons/more healing potion it can't give access to something interresing, and music is really boring. verdict: better play dark souls P.S: sorry for my bad english
11789	I love a good rouge-like, Salt and Sanctuary IS NOT A GOOD ROUGE-LIKE. This game is not 'difficult', it is a 'pain in the â¥â¥â¥.' There is a difference. The developers accomplished this by trying sooo hard to copy a formula that they killed what could've been a great side scrolling game. All the pretty visuals, metroidvania type gameplay, all the positive points about this game fall to the wayside thaks to its MASSIVE flaws. Like Grandma cutting a huge green fart in the chair next to you during thanksgiving diner. As great as everything couldve been, just one nasty old fart ruined it all. Only the animation is smooth in this game. Everything else (like the made-up â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t language you have to decipher JUST to create your charicter) is like being dragged down a gravel on your bare naked â¥â¥â¥. The menus never get an explination, no tutorial to help you decipher the word salad, no telling what you can and cant do. The developer is clearly malicious in their intent toward the player, Unless the player is a basement dwelling short â¥â¥â¥â¥ turbo nerd that can somehow play a game that cant be paused while googling every little detail about that game as they go along. 'But gee golly'' you say looking at the creation menus 'It can only get better from here'. Wrong. They pooch it.  All your told is what the controls are. Some games start you in a similar situation, but those game do a better job. You know what games i'm talking about, go play those. This game is tragic, there is so much potential here, too bad it's all hidden behind a needlessly convoluted and bloated leveling system, combat that get both frusting and stale at the same time. Weapons, you pick up a new weapon only to see how long youll be carrying it around, wishing you could use it. That wouldnt be too bad... if maybe there were a few more weapons to choose from. There are a bunch in the game, too bad youll only be able to use maybe four, and youll NEVER be happy with those four.  For the love of god, go play Dark Souls, Demon Souls, Bloodborne, ANYTHING but Salt and Sanctuary. This game is masterpeice of failures. Breaks my heart just to look at it... knowing i cant get my money back. If you play this game long enough to see for certain that it is a pale imitation, Steam will say that you have played too long and will not give you a refund. I tried. Just dont, its soooo disapointing.  This game reaches for the brass ring... and pulls off a fingernail. it is just awful.
11790	Cool concept but not very fun. I really thought I'd enjoy this game, but it is quite hard and there is a lot to take in (classes, upgrades, vendors) that I just don't enjoy in this style of game. Here are my Pro's and Con's (which you may find are oppposite for you).  Pro's: Lots of Classes to choose from Customisable characters  Bosses  Con's: Much more  Dark Souls  than  Metroidvania  Difficulty is quite high Character faces look unfitting to game world Washed out Color Palette
11791	This game works well enough but is an example of the repetitious tedium this sort of RPG is infamous for, where one must build up strength, willpower, magic skills, dexterity, etc.  How long does one wash, rinse and repeat just to gain abilities that are not very apparent?  I've grown tired of this game already since it offers nothing new in this genre.
11792	I really enjoyed this game for awhile. Some spoilers ahead.    Up until the 3rd brand was given out I really enjoyed the 'explore kill and kill bosses' nature of the game. After that it sort of becomes a 'now explore with puzzles and get lost and figure it out'. I get that the game is supposed to be difficult, hell I really enjoy that part of it. But let me fight the monsters, let me fight the bosses, don't make me fight convoluted puzzles and a map that requires backtracking (which doesn't explain when you need to do this). You just have to wander aimlessly to try and figure it out.   This game was good, the combat is fun, the weapons are fun, the bosses are fun. The amount of running required in the later parts of the game were almost enough to get me to put down the game, and were enough to make me give a negative review.   I was ranting and raving about how good this game was telling my friends to buy it, but now I'm telling them not to unless they want a strange progression which isn't explained anywhere.
11793	I played for about an hour and 45 minutes, was falling in love with it and then the game crashed out. I tried several times to get back into my saved game but when I would do that or click 'New Game' it would give me an error that said 'Not connected to the Steam servers (I was) so you can't play the game. This is a pre-release issue.' Or something to that effect.  With minutes left on the clock for my refund window, I had to return it. I am just glad this happened before I was past my playtime limit - I would have been very unhappy had my game done that and I was stuck with it. Which is the point of this review: I don't know what happened, but my game quit allowing me to start a new game or load any of my saves. No troubleshooting fixed it, and I am not inept. Be warned.
11794	Pros: - Nice translation of a souls game to 2D  Cons:  - unresponsive controls (button mashing, i hate button mashing) - hitboxes seem off - game inconsistency (i.e. I can stagger using greatsword weak attack, but strong attack doesn't stagger?) - no wake-up action (can't roll/block as soon as you get up, which means enemies can attack or grab you constantly) - too many level interconnections (the levels don't flow together so tracking where you are and where you want to go is confusing) - spindlebeast (not even a boss, just an excuse to ruin the flow of the game. bad idea from the devs)  Reached lvl 93, then just got tired of the unfairness and stiff controls. I've played and beat Darksouls 1-3 and Bloodborne and whenever I died I knew it was my fault. When dying in S&amp;S, I know it's the games fault.
11795	you cant just copy everything good and bad from dark souls. For a 2D platfomer with a world this complex you should have a map! Imagine playing castlevania symphony of the night without a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ map, how that feels is what I feel
11796	BROKEN UNDER MAC OS!  The game is not playable under Mac OS. Ver 1.0.0.6 Mouse doesn't click on menu/items/etc. Not in full screen, not in window mode. It is necessary to use space and navigate with TAB. Some menu are unaccessible, as they cannot be reached wit TAB. I asked for refund, Steam refused to refund.  The argument was: you played more than 2 hours. But, I just realized that mouse was important ONLY after I could not navigate through skills tree.  
11797	It's ultimate downfall is the fact that it was designed by one man. This game needed months of QA and polish to realize it's potential, but alas real world constraints have left it in it's current sorry state. So much of it is frustrating, upleasant or downright infuriating. Where From Software titles offer you a finely tuned challenge that feels satisfying to overcome, this game offers a annoying slog you're forced to get through to progress. It doesn't help that the creator chose to increase the penalty of death, compared to the games he's copying, and then littered half the areas with instant death on failure platforming sections, each of which represents a 5-10 minute slog back to where you were just to try again.  Where Souls games test your ability to learn from your mistakes, this game tests your patience for arbitrary â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. I've beaten DS 1 more times than I can count, DS 2, 3 and Bloodborne twice each. This game I've beaten once, and I'll never come back to it. I didn't enjoy playing it. Honestly, I think I stuck around to the end because of stubborness more than anything. Avoid, I do not recommend.
11798	The main cons of this game:  Performance: I don't know why, but in many of the areas, especially the darker ones for some reason, the game really stutters and runs worse than Dark Souls III does on my rig. There's no reason a 2D game should be running worse than an open world 3D one like DS III.  Platforming: This is easily the weakest part of the game in my opinion. The platforming just is not fun in any way. Most of it is simply jumping from one platform to another and hoping your character does not decide to not grab the edge and fall to his death. I've probably died as much from falling to my death as I have from actually fighting enemies.  Controls: This might have something to do with the performance drops, but the controls feel really sluggish in some fights. One of the most annoying things that happens is your character attacking in the wrong direction and hitting absolutely nothing. It seems like the attack button command takes priority over the move button command and instead of your character turning and then attacking if you press a direction and then press attack he will just attack and not turn at all.  Rolling in boss fights also has a bit of a curve to it. Bosses are treated as solid objects in all the cases I have seen and you have to roll in order to get past them and dodge their attacks. Unfortunately, the roll range seems really odd and more often than not I end up rolling into a boss and going absolutely nowhere because I get stopped dead in front of the boss.  If you can look past the control issues and grin through the platforming, then the game is pretty good. But, with all the Dark Souls clones that are either coming out or have already come out I think there are more polished games on the market that will give you more bang for your buck. This game has potential however and I'm looking forward to seeing if it gets more updates to polish out these problems or if they improve on the game in another installment.
11799	So imagine Dark Souls but in 2D. Problem is Dark Souls is hard to recreate in a 2D way. That's where this game falls short IMO. It tries too hard being something that it's not.   This game is meh. It has a lot of similarities to Dark Souls in terms of mechanics, customization, and overall layout. Problem with it is the difficulty. Personally, I feel it is challenging but for the wrong reasons; it's cheap. Enemies can corner you easily and lock you in, there are traps and pitfalls EVERYWHERE that have no indication of being there unless you already knew they was there, and all in all, it just lacks that feeling of satisfaction you get from getting past a difficult part, it's more like, 'oh thank god I'm finally done with that â¥â¥â¥â¥'.   Keep in mind, I'm a huge fan of Dark Souls, and I review this game based off of the Dark Souls template. I think the game overall is decent, but it's difficulty supplement doesn't feel anywhere near as polished and rewarding as Dark Souls. It's trying too hard to be Dark Souls when it really isn't. If it were more of a Metroidvania game, I think it could be better.
11800	As cool as this game is, I didnt see myself getting into this game, I really liked the art style and game mechanics, but for me it felt a little bit too difficult even on the easiest difficulty, if your a fan of Dark Souls or anything like that, then its a game for you, but for me I didnt like it as much as I wanted to, fo a game like this it should be a wee bit cheaper anyway thats all from me
11801	Incredibly poor level design, poor keyboard and mouse support, poor combat. Tries too much to be like Dark Souls without doing it right.
11802	Very frustrating. Tries to be Dark Souls, but lacks the great mechanics that makes Dark Souls fun.   
11803	I bought this game soley because of the comparisons to Dark Souls. The Souls series ruined most other games for me, and left me craving a similar experience. So, I went into Salt &amp; Salnctuary with high (admittedly, maybe too high) expectations. I was sorely disappointed. It certainly nails the atmosphere of the Souls games while creating and maintaining its own identity, but something just makes the experience uncomfortable, annoying even. I can't quite put my finger on it, but playing the game just isn't enjoyable to me. Two flaws I can identify, however, are the combat and stamina system. The combat is just bad. It feels clunky and unresponsive. Fighting often results in the character randomly facing the opposite direction for some reason, completely ruining the flow of the fight. Like Dark Souls, everything in Salt &amp; Sanctuary is stamina based. Swinging your weapon, rolling, and blocking an attack all drains your stamina bar; even raising your shield makes your stamina recover more slowly. The problem arises from the fact that everything takes so much stamina. You will run out of stamina at least a couple of times in a fight, leaving you completely defenseless. Boss fights make this problem even more clear. The idea is that a boss goes into an attack sequence, you block and roll to avoid damage, and then you use the boss' brief period of inaction to retaliate. However, after blocking and dodging, you rarely have enough to stamina to attack and then safely get out of range.   Both of these problems could be fixed (it's even possible that I'm simply not used to how this game works), but the aforementioned general lack of fun I experienced while playing the game means that I probably won't be returning to this title. If your a Souls fan, buy it on sale just to try it. I don't see it being worth the full price, though.
11804	If u gonna play with mouse+keyboard as a Bow/Crossbow character dont buy this game. Aim system its just unplayable.
11805	A challenging Souls-like that isn't really good enough to want to you keep playing through the frustrating enemies/bosses, unlike the actual Souls series.
11806	Worst ending since the Mad Max game. Poor controlling platforming disguised as 'difficulty'. A game so unbalanced I beat 7 of the end bosses the first time meeting them. I agree this game is what would happen if Dark Souls and Symphony of the Night had a baby. But this is what would happen if they raised that baby as a fundamentalist christian. It would be â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, like this game. Ever beat a game out of spite? Just to get your moneys worth? Cause that's the only reason I stuck through to the end of this crap. Still waiting for Ska Studios to put out a good game, instead of the janky hot messes they do release. And I have ZP2K9, Dishwaser: Dead Samurai, I made a game with zombies in it, zp2kx, dishwasher:vampire smile, and charlie murder. Great ideas. Janky as â¥â¥â¥â¥ in the implementation.
11807	Pros:  fun platforing good level design unique way to get npc's  large skill tree decent UI the sanctuarys are interesting npc's are unique TWO PLAYER! (offline) two player pvp (offline)  Cons:  Enemies are great at ganking an enemys bow, throwing weapons, and other ranged weaponry are much faster then the players Enemies and bosses can spam attack like their fapping no online pvp, or online co-op KNOCKBACK IS OP AF spam attacks its really â¥â¥â¥â¥ing to hard dodge, and shields are not very good you can only get passed enemys by jumping which is a bad idea, or rolling, so tanking is flawed they tried too hard to mke the boss attacks hard to dodge the hitbox is bs, for both players and enemies  they made it where you have to read item descriptions for the story, like in dark souls. does anyone actually like that they have to play it muiltiple times to know wtf is happening? people don't like that in the movie sucker punch, so i guess its a no  (largest con) if an boss/enemy does a jumping attack, and you move out of the way after they already jumped, they will change where they were going to land and A: stop mid air or B: go further which is bs. also, if an enemy aims to throw/shoot in one direction, and you move, they can defy all physics to hit you, and as said before, they can shoot/throw much faster then the player.  most cons: combat most pros: most are in dark souls and bloodborne
11808	At the time of writing this, I have had a total of 6-7 hours in this game. 3-4 on PS4 and 3 on Steam. I honestly tried to like this game. As someone who has beaten Demon's Souls 6 times, Dark Souls 12 times, Dark Souls 2 4 times, and Dark Souls 3 4 times, I cannot find a reason to keep playing this homage to the genre. I have learned a great deal of patience playing the Souls series, in fact I consider myself a better person because of it, but I can not play this game for more than 30 minutes at a time without getting mad.   Let's start with the positives, because there are some despite my initial paragraph. The game's platforming works well. The game has a fair bit of customization with its extensive sphere grid like skill tree. The weapons, for the most part, feel unique to each other and have weight and heft to them. The names of the zones are dark and brooding and I love em. While the humans look awkward, I do like the art style of the game. The music is dark and brooding, which is what you need for a game like this.   Now....for the bad stuff. The stuff I just cannot tolerate or forgive. The first is the god awful hit boxes. So many times I will get hit by things that I really shouldn't have. There are also times when rolling into an enemy to get behind them doesn't work, resulting in you getting hit anyway. An example is when I was rolling into an enemy to get past them, and got swiped into the air (because the hit box on the weapon seemed to be the entire screen despite being behind the hilt of the weapon at the time) and launched me into the air, falling down a pit just to get juggled by another enemy who knocked me down another pit to my death. Totally unable to prevent it, something Dark Souls is known for giving you a chance to prevent. There are also the enemies. Each enemy has unavoidable attacks which is a no no for a game like this. It may be fair, and some people may tell me to get good, but it doesn't FEEL fair. In fact almost 100% of this game doesn't FEEL fair. Dark Souls at least feels fair, if I die I know why and how to prevent it next time. I feel like each enemy I fight is just more bull stacked on top of more bull. 'Ok let's make an enemy who is invisible, can grab you in the air and on the ground, his grabs are unavoidable, and he can jump at you from off screen. Oh and make it take 90% of the player's life too.' 'Ok let's make a slime that attacks before you get a chance to react, and make it gravitate towards the player so they cannot dodge it, it instantly poisons him, and let's make the boss of this area throw them out during the fight. Oh! Let's also make it so there are no iframes after being grabbed so it can happen again immediately. AND, make it so each consecutive grab worsens the poison until the player dies in 1 second. Seems fair.'   Let's get down to the elephant in the room though. Even if the enemies are not being impossible, and I am making good progress without dying, the game is just simply not fun. It is not an engaging game. Maybe I have just played too much Dark Souls, but I do not think that is it. So at the time of writing this, I cannot in good conscience recommend this game. I wish I could, I wanted to like this game. I bought it twice. I gave it a solid 6 hours at least. I just cannot do it. I will continue to play the game, maybe something will spark my interest and if that day comes I will update this, but I think I am going to go back to Dark Souls for now.
11809	Like playing complete rip offs of better games? This homage (not a homage) to Dark Souls will test your skills as a gamer...well, only your paitence at jumping puzzles and un-ballanced enemies, weak level and character design.  Lest break this down. Graphics: Bland desaturated souls wanna be; both in level look and HUD style. We all love the Souls series and thats why we wanted to play Salt &amp; Sanctuary. Its just a shame that this game really has no style or direction much of its own. The characters are a pain to look at and the bosses apear to have been grabbed from someones lack luster doodles from 6th grade. Its a muddy confusing mess to look at.  Gameplay: Excesive jumping in platformers are a lazy gameplay/time extending excuse. Theres nothing old school about the jumping in S&amp;S. The platform traversing isnt there to get you around from point A to B etc. Its there to get in your way, or for the enemies to hit you off of. It would have been nice to need them to get around a labrynth like world. The bland layout will make you not give two salts about where you're going or what you're doing.   I like the weapons and how they look while attacking. They feel right and the gore adds to that; something i wish the Souls series had. I wont review the items and secondary trinkets as i generally dont care for that kind of item/gameplay mechanic anyway. Fighting is neat to look at but you tend to get sick of it when you have to go get your salt due to some BS enemies you cant see or lame lazy boss fight that you cant dodge roll around.  When you DO lose your salt you are kindly informed that you lost it FOREVER. That of course is on par with the Souls series, but this time its the above mentioned tripe thats takes your sou...er salt...away from you. When the game feels like its cheating you then punishing you for what its done; things get a little frustrating. Not only do you get the 'bad touch' from the game, you get charged for it too. You pay in gold to respawn back at the bondfi...er. sactuary. When you feel its not your fault you died, you feel like you got robbed. Pretending to be like those other difficult games without understanding why they're difficult but fun; doesnt make for a 'love of Souls games' game.  What the game does add that is nice: The extra abilities like wall jumping or upside down gameplay etc. When the game tries to be different (character design aside) it shines.  The whole time playing this game i just wanted to go play Souls instead. I admire the small team that made the game, and i like how far they've come. As a fantasy doodler myself, i like that the game is hand drawn. It's just sad that this game doesnt have much of its own design and style to be fresh. Trying to be a homage to that which we love, the game fails because its trying too hard.
11810	Alright. I like the game but i will vote no simply because whoever made this REALLY needs to take another look at his boss designs.   In this game you will fight 'hard' bosses. By hard a mean that they basically have undodgeable attack and combos that will one shot you. To win certain boss fights you'll have to rely on luck and nothing else. They wanted to make a Souls like game but they clearly missed the most important part, rewarding skill and punishing button mashing.   This game will punish you either way. For example; There is a boss in this game that will summon an orb that shoots out projectiles, if one hits you - you die. Now that sounds kind of bad right? It gets better. While this orb is quite easy to deal with alone, she can also use a machine gun skill, right? And if she's outside of a running distance - you die. Now this would be simple to do.. If she didn't fly.. OUT OF THE MAP. She can fly out of the map area, meaning that you'll be stuck at an invisible wall and you WILL die simply because there is literally nothing you can do about it.   And that's just one such example. I could bring up 10 more. The game concept is good but the execution is poorly done and you're not left with that souls feeling where if you lose you feel as if it was your own fault, in this game you feel that the game is punishing you for doing what you're supposed to do.
11811	Good idea, bad implementation.  Don't play if you like hitboxes to match what you see.
11812	Fun, but using m+k controls respond poorly. Feel sluggish. Mouse clicking completely non-responsive for menus, an issue many months old. Can't enable mouse during gameplay -- have to quit and re-enable.   Games like these are fun because the environments and enemies are challenging -- the primary challenge shouldn't come from buggy controls.
11813	Poorly designed 2D Dark Souls clone. Difficult for all the wrong reasons.
11814	games okay but could be better u can get mobbed pretty easy in this game an cant do much especially against the boss if ur cornered they just spam attacks on u an u cant roll pass them or jump over them instead just block until they kill you pretty much was expecting a little dissapointed since its supposed to be a dark souls inspired game but illpass an just wait for the dark souls 3 dlc an play a different game in the meantime
11815	If you love everything about the dark souls series (and all the pain and frustration that comes with it), you will love this. I wish I had researched it a little more.   It is everything I hated about when I first blindly purchased dark souls when it came out. You die and you get penalized for it. Die again and all your hard work grinding for experience is lost forever. I HATE when games punish you like this. Like come on it is a freaking video game not a do or die job.  Do your research if you are unfamiliar with dark souls. I am a fool for blindly buying this. It looked like a cool 2d castlevania style game. Its not.
11816	This game looked fun, I watched a bunch of reviews I looked at tutorials I looked to see if my computer could run it, which appearently it could, and I said screw it I'll buy it. I bought it, had a terrible time trying to install it, finally got it to load. Could barely navigate the starting screen. It was clear it was not optimized for PC, upon seeing that my mouse was moving sluggishly I attempted to lower the graphical settings. Which I guess, DON'T EXIST, about the only thing I could change was the resolution, buyt eh I've played Chivalry this laggy before, I've played many many games that were worse than this I can manage. No, no I could not my lord how terrible the control scheme is for this game. The mouse doesn't do â¥â¥â¥â¥ for this game, the block and parry were strangley hidden for a time and did not feel 'comfortable' I want to play this game but I'll wait till I get a better computer to retry. Maybe my comp is the issue. I hope it is.
11817	The game has a dirty, grungy style that I thought would grow on me. It did not. Worse, it's trying WAY too hard to be 2D Dark Souls, to the point where it essentially rips off (I think borrow would stretch the word too far) several key Dark Souls mechanics. The gameplay feels loose and unsatisfying mainly because it is trying to be 2D Dark Souls without the freedom of movement of Dark Souls. I just cannot recommend this game.
11818	Proof why Dark Souls HAS to be 3D. There is no way you can get precise hitboxes in a sidescroller, which the very essence of Dark Souls. This game is broken.
11819	It was fun for a while but the i got more repetitive and there was very little skill involved fighting bosses, it ended up just being me having to brute force attack them which is not very rewarding when you finally get them.
11820	The game looks great and mechanics are great. However it feels like they didn't make the game large enough. You'll run into a boss but won't be even close to defeating them. Instead you have to grind in a small area over and over until you level up enough to kill the bosses. Poorlevel design really. Doesn't quite deserve the metroid/vania tag. Almost but not quite there. 6.5/10
11821	No online co-op.  Local co-op causes significant issues for the second character's playthroughs.  No graphics settings.  In true dark souls fashion the port was never meant for PC. Unlike dark souls, the game didn't have a community patch to fix this within a week.  It's a worse castlevania with no map. Avoid.
11822	I like it, it reminds me of Dark Souls BUT!!!  And it is a big but!  2/3 of the time I feel like I died because the controls are not very responsive or because the enemy had some insane undodgeable cheap attack that they do over and over. It isn't challenging so much as infuriating and it feels cheap.  I know they are trying to be dark souls, but DS isn't punishing, it's fair. You die because you didn't learn enough. This game you die because the enemies have insane attacks that cannot be dodged, blocked or interrupted, or the controls don't work properly and you drop through a platform and fall to your death when you were actually trying to jump.  Needs work on the unresponsive controls, they really get on my nerves. Till it is tightened up it cannot be recommended despite the fact that I love the concept, and that its basically 2D dark souls.
11823	Everyone in the reviews seem to think this game is good, and its perfect for people who like dark souls. Problem is its like bootleg dark souls, and heres why.  this game is trying way too hard to be Dark Souls, Which is fine, but they don't seem to understand why Dark souls is good.  The Story seems to be as simple as 'Save the Princess' or something. which is alright i guess, but the problem is the setting seems to be just some island full of undead and monsters, and people just live here, just doing their jobs like nothing is going on. Nobody really talks about the monsters, like the monsters are just a normal occurance or whatever.   The first NPC you encounter just asks you some yes or no questions and then asks you if you follow any of the 3 religions, without telling you if theres any point to picking a god. Now with the Covenants of dark souls, the game would provide an NPC that basically tells you what they're all about. Like the way of the white is repersented by a priest. who asks you if you would like to join their cause and get some miracles.  So coveniants in this game are kinda watered down, big deal. what about the other friendly NPCs Like, i said. Everyone in this game is just off, but not in the good way. Theres a knight you meet sortly after you beat the first boss, and he asks you. 'hey there pal, would you like to hear about my quest!' I was like, sure whatever whats your quest. 'oh you know! gotta get into the castle and slay the dragon! haha!' Oh yeah, just gotta defeat the large beast, sounds like â¥â¥â¥â¥ing fun dude. why are you here? who gave you this quest? What are you doing just standing there waiting for me to do it!  Well, story and writing sucks. hows the gameplay. the gameplay is not that great. This game is a 2D sidescroller Metroidvania! which isnt bad. i really enjoy games like symphony of the night, no problems here, map designs are fine. Weird thing is that they seem to have shortcuts everywhere. theres always seems to be a ladder to kick down or a door to open with a switch. Which i guess isnt too bad. makes backtracking less of a pain the â¥â¥â¥.   Another problem i have is the lack of a map, Since most the areas look almost exactly the same at times, you're going to need a map. But theres no map. meaning if you don't know where you're going, you're probably going to be stuck for awhile. which is not good in a Metroidvania.  The combat in this game is kinda fun. Whacking the weak undead is satisfying.  But the problem lies in the tougher enemies. thats when the gameplay seems to stop. instead of being intense 1v1s to the death. it turns into how many hits does it take to kill this guy. You can't naturally see enemy health bars. You can only see bosses health bars. another problem is that the bigger enemies attacks don't seem to have a windup on their attacks. meaning you'll end up taking huge damage because you couldnt 'act' fast enough to move out of the way.  well whatever, if enemy damage is annoying. lets just 2 hand the weapon since Shields just reduce the damage instead of outright BLOCKING like its supposed to. Well, i found this odd bug when you're 2 handing the Starting sword makes it deal less damage. when i was using strong attacks with my sword and shield, they did 10 damage every hit.  but while i was 2 handing the sword. it dealt only 8! 8 damage! What the hell!   in conclusion. its just a game attempting to ride off of the 'oh dark souls is really hard. so lets just make a hard game without understanding the elements we're lifting from it.'
11824	This is not to be compared to Dark Souls. This is a platformer with a broken stamina bar unnecessarily attached to it (Roll = 1/2 Stamina bar). Don't buy it if you came here because you heard that it's like DS, better buy a DS game you don't have.
11825	Not terrible, but know what you're getting into. The platforming undermines almost everything in the game.  And you're going to spend a lot of time just in recovery frames, because hits just send you all over the place.  Interesting entry into the 'souls' genre, but really misses the mark. I imagine the massive positive reviews for this are more for that it stands alone in this genre, and isn't terrible.  However, cannot recommend it, because it mashes genres without solving the problems it generates. Especially when it's a solved problem.
11826	I played this to the maximum 2 hours I was allowed before requesting a refund.  My final verdict? Meh 6/10. The looks and aesthetics are perfectly fine, it gives off the proper atmosphere and the background blends (though some areas flowing into others looks a tad odd). The animations and combat feel clunky though you can easily compensate and that alone doesn't take from the experience. Rolling in the game works fine, I had little difficulty rolling through blows even with fat rolling. The Salt is a direct rip off of Souls from Dark Souls, but its a proven mechanic and functions fine here alongside Gold. The sanctuary and levelling up system is interesting, I wish I could have explored it more though it seems to cripple adjusting builds. Only fought the Sodden Knight (first Boss) and he was a cake-walk so nothing to say there on Bosses besides block, stab, roll, jump repeat until half hp then block, roll, block, attack, jump repeat. Overall I like the game, so why downvote and request a refund? Combat in general. The enemies have very random patterns of attack which alone is not a big deal, but the game is prone to throwing a half-dozen of them at you at once making it difficult to approach the situation. They also benefit from infinite stamina and no way to properly deflect or hinder their attacks or movement rendering Shields virtually useless when they swing endlessly. Rolling is easy though futile if you are still in the enemies reach as they will turn on a Dime and continue thier frenzy without hesitation regardless of what combo they may have been in. Couldn't try magic but found no way of properly aiming with a Bow which I found rather disappointing. Lastly enemies with thier random attack patterns and endless frenzied swings will most assuredly stunlock and kill you if you are surrounded by any more than 2 at any time making groups a nightmare to handle.  All in all it was a nice game and these are my first impressions with the mere 2 hours of playtime I was permitted. The game does not suffer from poor controlls, aesthetics, or level design. In fact I found them stellar and well implemented.  This game suffers from poor enemy design which cripples the entire experience.
11827	Tried to like this game, but I couldn't: it just punishes you all the time. No matter what you do and how you do it: you wil die. Do not other players fool you: it has nothing to do with skill. For example, bosses, while having the memorable attack paterns, will use them faster and more frequently. When an enraged boss executes 3 attacks in a row you can only pray for one of them to be dodgeable via jump or movement, because you simply don't have enough stamina to do the third roll. Even the ordinary enemies may give you a hard time: did you do that roll half a second later than you should? Die from an attack series and die.  I urge you to look YouTube videos on how players beat the game: you'll see that even the ablest of them are constantly receiving damage (and a lot of it). Frustration is constant: clunky controls, slowpoke hero reaction and attack delay on every single weapon.
11828	Trying way too hard to be 'hard' but its just cheap and unfair
11829	THIS GAME â¥â¥â¥â¥ING SUCKS! No offense to the creators but whoever thought that insane knockback and damage by enemies plus nothing but platforms and infinite pits WAS A â¥â¥â¥â¥ING â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ what were you thinking? If you're gonna make a clone of dark souls and symphony of the night and give it fall damage and unbalanced bosses you took the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥est parts of both and put them together expecting my nostalgia boner to fix the â¥â¥â¥â¥ign holes in your design.
11830	Don't get me wrong, the game looks awesome and is kinda fun to play. The only complaint I have (and it's a big one) is that travelling in 2D in this Soul-like game feels not right. Let me explain: 2D movements makes it hard to dodge something as you can't always go trough something while doing it. It makes some battles extremly unfair as you can't go pass the enemy to avoid damage nor running in the opposite way, because the attack got too much range.  I can add the game is way too dark, like you're gonna have a headache if you don't tune up the brightness of your monitor, and there's no option for that in-game.  Flying in every direction while taking a huge hit is not what I was looking for too but that's just my opinion.  Good concept, so-so execution.
11831	Low ratings because it's a negative review, period.  A 2D Souls game with some not great design choices. This game is not a roguelike or roguelite. It is a clearly Souls inspired game, even stated by the developer.  Good Animations are satisfying. Visceral and fun combat.  Nice atmosphere. Bad Enemies can grab you from different planes and from across ledges, notably the beginning wolves.  It has the DaS 2 equivalent of lifegems, making it a bit too easy to get health back. It's not clear how to tell if someone is an enemy or an NPC due to the art style. Not the most important thing, but it's annoying.  The inventory isn't very clear on how weapons and shields work. You have two slots for either a weapon or a shield on either side of the inventory, but equiping a weapon on either side will only let you use one of those weapons if you're two handing.  No obvious equip load indicator, so no way to know what's too heavy on sight, something Souls does right.  No obvious armor or weapon stats, so no way to know what's good or bad on sight, something that, again, Souls does right.  No normal enemy life bars, which is just a QOL thing, but still.  The UI is just clunky and doesn't flow well.  It's a more rough Souls, basically. I personally didn't like it, but hey, you might.
11832	This game is beyond stupid, damn near impossible, things happen when even if you've played before you're not expecting them and you get one shotted.  I hate everything about this game, the controls are crappy, the gameplay is fine, there is no set storyline and it's beyond difficult, it's unreasonably difficult.   
11833	If you are looking for a game that is a homage of Dark Sous, play Lords of the Fallen.  This game is a rip off of Daek Souls. When I reached the last boss, and I see the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t boss and the music reminisce of Gwyn battle complate with the piano and ochestral music, I uninstalled the game. Fighting Gwyn is much fairer than this final boss.   At least Lords of the Fallen attempts to put its own spin on the Dark Souls formula. This is a copy and paste job.
11834	I wanted to like this game so badly, but after not even 2 hours of playing I cannot go on for more. Enemies use cheap combos to kill you quickly, and will do it over and over and over again  I died to a freaking blob because there was 2 of them spamming their jump attack that stuns and poisons me, and I couldn't do a damn thing about it  The atmosphere is cool and the music + combat is fun for the most part, but with the enemies and the cheap tatics I just can't recommend this game to any of my friends im sorry  If steam doesn't give me a refund I guess I could attempt to play it again but I highly doubt it
11835	It's sad this game had so much potential to be a good game, but isn't.  Controls sucks. Attacking cancels any momentums. If you leaping forward and press the attack button, you immediately stop where you are and slash the sword.  UI is really really bad. This game has tons of items so Inventory UI is important, right? As it tuens out, this game's Inventory UI is so bad I have no idea what am I equipping right now. I don't know what kind of effect my current equipments has. I can't easily compare two equipments to determine which is the better item.  So, naturaly, I want to quit the game in less than half an hour. But I couldn't figure out how to propery quit the game!  So I forcebly killed the process.  This is ridiculously bad UI! I saw so many games with bad UI but nothing is worse than this.   I hope the developer stop making games and use my payment money as a fund to start a completely new work which doesn't involve UI design, computer game or software development.  The world will be a better place without this kind of game which looks fun but isn't.  
11836	Poor combat design doesn't make for a good challenge; it just makes for a bad game. Gaining inspiration from poor combat design makes an even worse game. I regret buying this. Pros: -World is sizable, fairly intricate, and the art is unique -Wide variety of gear -Good amount of classes -Majority of bosses are good, if not simple -Salt reclamation is an initially interesting idea  Cons: -Enemy AI is laughable at best, refund-worthy at worst -Jumping and climbling onto ledges rarely works correctly -Player animations and the roll mechanic are poorly designed, leaving you vulnerable and being seconds too long -Music is far from bad, but gets old fast -Talent tree is a downright boring and pointless selection of base attributes and gear access
11837	Played through most of the game and enjoyed it got to pitchwoods where I was punished for my playstyle and uninstalled grats guys. If this was just some difficulty thing I wouldnt be upset having put hundreds of hours into each souls game and loving all of them, but having my playstyle be made useless over trash mobs is insulting and honestly makes the game unenjoyable. do not recommend.
11838	Before platforming part kick in (platforming is just terrible in this game) game was great.
11839	I'm trying really hard to like this game. Was super excited about it, having watched a quick look of it and dug the overall feel of it. But, having got my hands on it I can't really recommend it. The controls are super clunky and unresponsive at best, to the point where it seems like a design choice in order to make the game more difficult. I was playing on a wireless 360 controller but even when I switched to mouse n keyboard it was still a major factor. There are big sections where a well timed jump is necessary and it often seems touch and go as to whether the game registers it or not. This goes for other controls like the roll as well. With it being a 2D environment, both of these are essential in defeating enemies but neither can be relied upon in a pinch. Thats not even factoring in the difficulty in actually memorising the (seemingly random) attack patterns of bosses and their ability to spin on a dime mid combo. I'm also finding the colour scheme difficult to look at for long periods of time. Even if I know a trap is somewhere I can still have difficulty locating it and feel like I'm constantly straining my eyes. Not really liking the general enemy design, especially the blob enemies. Their attacks seem cheap and too easy for the AI to land. I'm gonna persist with the game, and would probably give the game a 'maybe' rating if I could. If you can, try a demo.. Wish I had
11840	i realy wanted to like theis game, but the rng is to strong. and different to dark souls, the game is in many ways just unfair.
11841	this game doesn't work with a mouse at all, for a pc game that's a complete deal breaker for me. avoid this until they fix it or wait until it's 75% off
11842	Like Dark Souls minus the good parts.
11843	If you're looking for a challenge, for a real hard game that will test your skill and wit, that won't mess around and handhold you... you'll better look somewhere else, because THIS GAME isn't any of that. But if you're looking for an unfair neutered Dark Souls rip off in 2d where the developer decided that the only thing Dark Souls was missing was crappy platforming, then it's a game for you.  This game tries so hard to be Dark Souls, yet fails on so many levels. Appearantly harder=better, yet they completely forgot about any pay off! In Dark Souls, enemies are mostly slow, yet they can eff you up quite easily if you let your guard down. Here, their normal swing is faster than your attack while two-handing a one handed weapon! Dodging is useless, because when you dodge-roll behind them, they immediately turn around to complete their combo and shove a sword up your â¥â¥â¥â¥. Enemies spawn in clear day light behind your back, ready to once again introduce your sphinchter to an unhealthy dose of hardened steel. But the biggest freaking gripe I have with this game is platforming. WHY!? Why did you think it was a good idea?   Who needs good story? Throw it out the window! Let's add crumbling platforms! Our enemies are cheap and deaths are unfair! â¥â¥â¥â¥ you, we're trying to be dark souls, so git gud, it's not the game that's â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, it's you who are unskilled.   This game sucks and is not worth your money. Go save up for Dark Souls 3 instead.  Upd: Attempted yet another playthrough of it. Nope. Still â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ gabage. Except I found another con - the bosses are complete â¥â¥â¥â¥. They are bland and completely forgettable, and if they aren't pathetically easy, they're hard as balls because they depend solely on your damage output - you have to kill them before they flood the screen with their crap.   What a waste of code this game is. Avoid it at all costs.
11844	This game wants to be DarkSouls, it really tries hard. But falls so short in so many ways. I can appreciate difficulty in a game, even perceived difficulty can be appreciated once overcome.  This game just fills my salt reservses and doesn't make me want to come back to it. I'd rather farm Lothric Castle for 24hr straight... and that doesn't yield much.
11845	**GAME DOES NOT LOAD** I really wanted to play this game but I was unable to. IT's not due to bad hardware (I run a higher end PC, which I build and OC) but rather a .Net framework issue that I tried again and again to fix with no luck. I was able to get to the start screen one time only for the game to crash with in mins. I have many hours in DS1-3 and this game looked to be a decent 'souls like' game. I have to not reccommend though because with all the issues people have with AAA PC games these days I've yet to encounter one but I did with this indie game.
11846	Only difficult thing about this game is putting up with the horrible controls. Refunded.
11847	Imagine a metroidvania game with Dark Souls controls and without a map. Well that's basically it.
11848	Controls are frustrating and really ruins the experience for me. The game had so much potential.
11849	Game was pretty average to start then I got bored dieing against the Sodden Knight. There are better games to play instead!
11850	Has a lot of promise, but rather than have a fair yet challenging game that a large group would enjoy, they seem to have decided to cater to the small minority that get their jollies off of very hard games where you spend hours trying to fight the same boss over and over, until you become a robotic pattern master. Wish it was a little more Castlevania level difficulty and less 'let's make it ultra frustrating' level. Or at least an option to let the player decide.  There's too many good games around vying for my free time to spend hours frustrated trying to fight the same boss over and over.
11851	  It's embarrassing how hard this game is trying to be Dark Souls. Thing is, though, if I wanted to play Dark Souls... I'd go play Dark Souls. There's three of em now, surely there's at least one that'd handle my need for its particular brand of gameplay - I don't need a fourth one.  I do appreciate the experiment of bringing Dark Souls to the 2D format, though. I think I'd like S&amp;S a lot more... or really, at all... if it wasn't so blatantly trying to be Dark Souls. In many ways it could be considered like a progression of the Castlevania playstyle (but not Metroidvania/Castleroid style.) The gameplay is solid and I understand the many reviews praising it, but while I think it's technically proficient and put together well, I also feel it suffers greatly from being way too similar to Dark Souls. As I already said, if I wanted to play Dark Souls... I'd just go play Dark Souls.  Also, the art style is just â¥â¥â¥â¥ing horrible. I guess environment design is okay, but all of the sprites and characters look like crap. I know plenty of people like the art style, but I personally think it's crap.  I got the game for free from a friend and that's probably the only way I'd ever play this game. As it is, I've already had my fill. No way I'd ever pay for this.  Bottom line: if you want to play Dark Souls, go play Dark Souls and give this one a skip.
11852	you can see its influenced heavily by the souls series, unfortunatly does not work well with the 2d sidescrolling style of the game. gets very monotonus very fast.
11853	Recieved a Malware detection from my security and it took immediate action and removed the files. I have sent in the information to see what the issue is but it removed it from my pc on its own and it only does that to select dangerous files.
11854	I am not down voting this for being a Dark Souls rip off, im not down voting it because it's a bad game, I am down voting it because it is uplayable with the weapon reach every character in this game has (including your own) The reach is imaginary and much MUCH bigger than the weapon itself making it utterly impossible to know whether or not you will get hit and forces you to roll everytime you are attacked, this is hard considering you will spend alot of time attacking or jumping in a fight, you know, FIGHTING THE ENEMY YOU ARE FACING. Cant recommend this game with the broken weapon reach.
11855	Honestly, even Dark Souls was more fair than this game. I don't know how this trend even started like did they say 'make a game and make it unfair as hell so it will have more public whining and you will get more commercial' or something?   I will change this review and make it more extensive after I play it for a while but my first impressions are not good. Specially because mobs don't have a pattern and they can just do batshit crazy combos out of nowhere. As it seems some of them don't even have stamina so they can spam their attacks and block as much as they want. I think in games like these, mobs have to be similar to the player in general like they must have similar pros or cons. While you cant even block anything properly, a mob in the begining can take hit after another without even a scratch and attacks and blocks like he doesn't have stamina at all.  I'm really hoping that my opinions are like this because I just started the game but I think I'm kinda familiar to this type of games so I think I'm not completely wrong about my observations. By the way, I already beat the first boss and reached the second so I don't think I am a bad player)      
11856	Quick review: - sluggish controls - poor hitbox detection - no screen lock for multi-screen users. You mouse will move onto another screen and jump to desktop at the most â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ moments. - cheap level design with unavoidable leap of faiths. Why isn't there at least a peek around function. - boring repetitive attacks  Wait for sale.
11857	Every aspect of this game is STOLEN from Dark Souls. Devs call it an homage, but it's just another Dark Souls-like rip off. The gameplay feels clunky(not in the Dark Souls way). Everything is familiar if you've played a Souls/bloodborne game, but with none of the polish. Crashes, bugs, poor enemy AI, terrible map layout, and poor boss design and execution plague this game. I wanted to like this game being a fan of the Souls/borne series, but I cannot recommend this game until many things are fixed.  One more thing, this game has garbage platforming.
11858	Offical Salt and Sanctuary Review:   'Hey look heh hah huh we can make a Dark Souls game too heh hah so good man its hard dude so good PUNSHING gameplay and really intimidating skill tree wow lookout beginners so good our game isnt for the faint of heart woah dude sick just like a Souls game but 2D woah dark gothic artstyle that honestly looks poorly done and woah lets make the areas look like a complete eye sore that appears to have had a 5 year old get a hold of a dull, gray piece of construction paper and scribble sharpie all over it heh hah thatll be PUNISHING woah'
11859	Dark Souls is my @SS, I bought this 'game' because people kept talking stuff like 'oh! its a 2D dark souls', 'what a great mix between castlevania and souls series' and 'it's difficult'. The truth is that this thing is just a stupid ripoff rofl, I'm REALLY dispointed.  I think I don't need to clarify that I'm a souls/borne fan, DS1 is my favorite game ever, but I also LOVE the old castlevania series. I've spent a stupid amount of time playing SOTN on my PS1 with my cousing, who suprisingly got EVERY single item in that game haha xD Those were really good times! But Salt and Sanctuary doesn't really appeal to me, in fact, it's frustrating, the OST is really annoying (there are a few tracks that keep repeating itself rofl), there are TRAPS HIDDEN everywhere (I know, Dark Souls has traps duh, but they are pretty obvious and fair, since the game shows you the mechanics and don't even try to hide stuff from you, they are there to incresse the challenge, not like the malicious ones in this game!), level design is just poor (it's not fun, what can I say =\), 'human' characters are ugly (like really, they look like a 8 years old cartoon hahaha), the story is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too cheap (honestly, the lore here is more uninteresting than the game...) and finally, what is not Dark Souls is Castlevania LMAO  So yeah, the game does it right sometimes too, like the stones system for example, you can 'upgrade' your bonfire, I mean, sanctuary with merchants, 'leaders', blacksmiths, etc and the skill tree is GREAT (yet another copy *PoE* cof cof).  But that is just too little to keep entertaining me, this game is cheap and it doesn't have a mind / heart of its own.  'OH BUT THE GAME KNOWS THAT ITS 'INSPIRED' BY DARK SOULS' &gt; again, inspired is my @â¥â¥â¥!!! Hyper Light Drifter (an absolutely AMAZING game) has some inspiration from DS and other way older games, but still, it is a great and unique thing! The devs of this software (ska studios) are so lazy and shameless that they couldn't even NAME THE GAME RIGHT rofl. Tell me, 'Salt and Sanctuary' feels like a good name for you? I thought so hahaha, not even the name has creativity.. oh man.. what a waste of time..  If you are looking for a good 2D game, go play hyper light drifter, that game is UNIQUE and most important F U N !  I 'THINK' that the problem here is that SaS is TRYING to be a Dark Souls, when Dark Souls is a thing by itself, so it doesnt work, and at last, From Software + Miyazaki are GENIOUSES, and CopyPaste Studios, ops sorry, Ska Studios ...Â¯\_(ã)_/Â¯  Yeah, I know my english is way worse than this game xD
11860	this game tries real hard to be something it will never be.
11861	Yet another Dark Souls wannabe which does not understand the difference between challenging and unfair.  The game just â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ me off 1 hour in. ItÂ´s just a crap game overall, donÂ´t buy.
11862	I love Dark souls but this game that tries to be it doesn't know how to do bosses right because more often then not they pull a 'you're dead' combo that's nearly unavoidable making them more luck than anything.
11863	This is pure â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t, the most important things like hitboxes and roll immunity are â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up to the point where you can only â¥â¥â¥â¥ing guess whether you`re gonna roll out of a hit or not Get a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing professional on your â¥â¥â¥â¥ing team, maybe give a call or two to FromSoftware, â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dickwads.
11864	Hi, it seems I upset some very sensitive children with my last review, and was instructed by them to write more words.   So let me start by saying, note to self, cannot write a negative review or children will harrass you on end for some unknown reason.   Now about the game.  If your in the mood for a sit back and have a few drinks game this isn't for you. The game while having some good elements, can be difficult if your not switched on. It can be unforgiving and frustrating at times if you want a fast pace revive and move on.  To all the kids upset please forgive me, I hope I have not ruined your life.
11865	A game that desperately wants to emulate the style of the Souls series without understanding what makes those games brilliant beyond the 'it's so hard' schtick.
11866	It's 2D Dark Souls. That's a bad thing.  I had hoped that it could grab me where DS failed, that it could have been an improvement on it. But it has the same infuriating problems DS has, and then some.  In 2016 there shouldn't be any games that have checkpoints instead of saving freely unless the checkpoints are frequent enough. They are not in this game.  In 2016, no game should be made without a pause function. This game has none. How does a game not have a pause function? What the actual f*ck? What, nothing I have to do, like answer a phone call or the door or someone on IM is more important than playing this game? F*ck that, man.  As with DS, when I have literally any other game of the ones I play, why would I play this and get angry and waste time running to the same spots over and over when I can achieve SO much more in other games?
11867	Nope
11868	Does Not acutally have online multiplayer apposed to what it says on the store. Every enemy more so the bosses has phantom attack range and can turn around mid attack to hit you if you dodge past them, basically removing all chance you have of not taking damage (Easiest seen with the second boss when she digs her sword into the ground and then somehow 180's whilst they are still in the ground to hit you).
11869	Garbage. dont waste your money or time on this peice of trash game.  Falling damage simulator is what this garbage should be called.  only meme lords like this crap.  devs are lazy and shouldnt ever be allowed to make another game again. and by devs i mean the mom and pop team or 2 idiots.
11870	What a mess.
11871	Why did they make it not good when they could have made it a real good.
11872	Warning: running this or any of RuneStorm's other games can brick your system.  The installation manifest for this game includes an outdated, buggy .NET installer, which on some systems will force a reboot without asking for permission or giving an option to cancel, and afterwards, the system will be put into an infinite loop of automatic rebooting because the installer continually runs (and fails) on startup.  Despite this being a known issue from their previous games, the developer did nothing to address it for any of their titles. Apparently they think it's acceptable to brick users' systems and expect us to put in the time and work required to research and fix it.  To that end, in the hopes of mitigating the loss to others, I will go one better and at least provide a shortcut to anyone in need of a solution: when the installer fails with an error message, open Task Manager (from Ctrl-Alt-Del menu) to terminate the dotnet* process before closing the installer (this prevents the imminent reboot that will otherwise happen), and then download and run the NetFXRepairTool from Microsoft to stop the installer from running again on the next boot.  Note, however, that Steam will still not see a complete installation, and you will need to terminate the dotnet* process again when you try to run the game in order to get past the setup stage.
11873	Rooks Keep seems like it would be a good game, but the problem is that the multiplayer is completely dead, there are no servers for this game anymore, literally none, and in May the dedicated servers were shutdown.  The game has multiple modes to play, there are two chess modes, classic and combat chess, and then a range of arena modes, which really feel like they are intended to be played online.  from playing against bots (because i couldn't play with human players), the combat seemed enjoyable and it allows you to upgrade your character during a game with points you get from killing other players, you can buy upgrades such as increased damage and movespeed, and there are quite a few different things to choose from.  However the main reason i am not recommending this game is because bots will only keep you entertained for so long, and most of the reviews of this game were written a long time ago, so there was probably a decent playerbase at the time they were written, but a game like this without multiplayer servers is definately not worth the asking price, I don't think many people would buy something like CS:GO without multiplayer, and this game shouldn't be any different.  TL:DR Don't buy this game unless you are ok with playing alone with bots, or there is a price drop.
11874	  dead game to play online totaly not recomended to play online only for single player or to play with a friend out this avoid this all cost the game is realy good but due the multyplayer i vote no
11875	Game has little content, I value the game at about 5 dollars, you won't be playing this game for long but you'll dabble with it.
11876	The gameplay is probably the worst part about this game - it mainly lacks an intelligent design. I regret buying this.
11877	Could of been a good game if they could place the peices in the corect starting location.
11878	This game had potential, sadly noone is playing it online. A game that was released on 5 Dec, 2014 without dedicated servers. - That is quite disappointing.
11879	Bad game. Not worth any money.
11880	NO simply NO! crappy controlles, anoying sound and borring gameplay. absolut waste of money!
11881	its really laggy :\
11882	A top down action/adventure game obviously inspired by Silent Hill. Unfortunately it has a ton of issues:  The translation is pretty bad. The developers are Russian and there's a ton of spoken and written Engrish. The main character repeats the same lines over and over whenever you pick up an item. They should've kept the original Russian voices and gotten someone else to translate the text.  The level design is awful, the first three levels are nothing but mazes with almost identical rooms. There's a radar on the screen but it only shows you and enemies as dots and nothing more. There should've been a map system that slowly uncovers the level as you move through it since they involve searching for items and, as it stands, you'll spend a lot of time running in circles searching for the last Document you need because everything looks the same.  The game tells you to conserve ammo, yet the levels are so narrow that if you try to run past enemies you will get hurt. The only way through is to shoot them.  Unless this changes later on in the game the only enemy types are identical zombies that attack you once they get close.  Unlike most cheap Steam games these days playing it shows that the developers tried to make a good game, but it's way too flawed for me to recommend it.
11883	 Darkness Assault is an indie horror game in which you have been kidnapped and taken to some kind of prison / research installations, as Katrine you have to find what happened.   There are some things that makes this game a bad experience:      Enemy models are the same.  Different models would be great.     Camera.  You can't rotate the camera.     The level design is awful.  All rooms are the same just with different objects.     Poor animations.  Enemies moves like if them have pooped in their pants.      The voice acting it's a joke  You can clearly hear that them are having issues to pronounce some dialogues, due devs are russians.     Translation into english is poor.  You can find senseless dialogues *cough* *cough* Someone used Google Translator *cough*.   This game would be good,  sounds like a good story , but there are many things that makes this game another failed attempt of an horror game.  4 / 10
11884	 A bad attempt at a survival horror
11885	This is a very poor effort. It can hardly even be called survival horror as you find like 2 dozen batteries and only end up using 1 even though the place is bright enough to see everything for the entirety of the game anyway! Just a pointless attempt to make it seem like it has more going on in it than it actually does. Ammo is plentiful as well, as are health packs.  Gameplay is horrid. Walk down samey-looking murky corridors, aim at shambling enemies, shoot and move on. Your biggest enemy is getting caught on the furniture while trying to backpedal from your foes. I didn't think the levels were hard to find your way around as some have reported but maybe the map feature is new, which really does help, particularly in the third and arguably most winding level. The aim and shoot feature is horribly bugged, often needing to press fire several times to get one shot off. Even the ending is complete anti-climax. Not even a boss fight. You just kill some more of the guys you've been killing and walk down a corridor and then the final cutscene rolls.  Took 49 minutes from start to finish and even at that I was getting bored. All dialogue and found document text is complete gobbledygook. From what I could make out it seemed like the usual mad-scientist-abducts-people-and-experiments-on-them-to-create-zombie-mutants. Cause why not.  Avoid like the zombie plague.
11886	Darkness Assault is a topdown 'horror' game.  The thing is though that the horror is not in the game itself, it is more the things surrounding it.   First of all the game's highest resolution is 720p, which is not really acceptable in this day and age.  Secondly the textures simply look as if there was absolutely no effort put into polishing them at least a little bit.  Thirdly the animations look hideous or don't exist at all.   So graphicswise it doesn't look good at all, and soundeffectswise it won't get better: The voiceacting ingame is dull and repetitive. Though after 3 levels I still don't know where exactly the flashlight comes in now.  The guns sound like they were filled with blanks and there is no sound on impact.    Only performancewise the game is nicely done, with getting 60+ fps consitently.  The aforementioned facts are the most horrifiing things in this game, I am not joking. The zombies and other enemies as well as the ambient sounds are even less frightening than the Military Quater in Naxxramas in WoW... and that wasn't even that frightening to begin with.  Conclusions: I cannot, by any means, recommend this game. In the first three levels I felt absolutely no fear, which is the point in horror game in my opinion. Apart from that it looks and plays like a budget game, but money is not the problem here. It is the fact that this game takes time to play and I wouldn't dedicate any more time to that game than I did for this review.   First impressions video is here:  http://youtu.be/v9N9WIQ2nus 
11887	Bad. Just bad.  - Levels act like mazes. - Very short (although for the price given, this could be justified). - Poor transaltion and character says the same line every time you pick up an item. (i.e. you pick up adrenaline 5 times, you'll hear the character say the same line 5 times...) - The 3 weapons you get in the game all do the same damage. - Poor variety in enemies. 2 different enemies, Clones and Security guards. Clones, however, do have 2 different models. (Great!) - Game crashed 3 times for me. Twice when starting the game up and once while in-game.  Overall, I don't recommend it, even at its price. The 'game' becomes more of a chore through its terrible level design and lack of difficulty.
11888	I tried to like this game but is simply bad. The movement of the main character is horrible, there is low ammo, and the enemies are too strong and fast,  Total dissapointment, Don`t buy it.  Update:  They made a patch for the game, and I'm glad to say they fixed A LOT of issues,, now there are better graphics, the controls are more responsive but still a little clunky, there is more ammo and health packs, the enemies are not OP, and they added a map since the first level but you still need a good sense of orientation.  Do I recommend this game now? Maybe, it is much better now, and I was able to complete the game after the patch.  The players could have avoided A LOT of frustration if this patch would have released since the launch date.
11889	This game has a few problems that need to be fixed. First, the story is really bad. The game is about some old professor who is accused of experimenting on people. So this girl (which you control) wants to find out more about it. Don't even ask me who she is or where she came from because I have no idea. Second, there is no map or mini-map in the whole game. You will have to work your way through each level and remember if you've been to this place before or not. Lastly, ammo is very limited and it takes a few tries to kill just one enemy since there is no tutorial at the start of the game.
11890	I can't believe this game is not free....Seriously, i know free games that are longer than this, i finished it under 1 hour! Voice acting is very bad, judging by it's sound probably russian english. Story ending    is huge tease, you go to to some hall and then few scenes appear where you see killed profesor (person behind all of this), and then your character says something like 'wanna know how i did it? well let's leave that story for another time!'....Just WOW :O    Well i enjoyed only a little bit killing zombies, nothing special. Play this game only if you get it as gift (as i did) ! 
11891	Pretty boring third-person action horror game. You complete some trivial tasks like finding documents to get through each of the five fairly short levels. Translation into English is poor. Nothing of any real interest here.
11892	Oh boy. Another horror game. This is me being facious. This game is boring, andthe horror is non existant.  The best thing I can say about this game is the translation, which gives comical moments as the dialogue doesn't make sense. But regardless, you get a game that ugly to look at, very confusing in where it wants you to go, and doesn't have anything close to the word fun.  Also, had to restart twice after the game would not allow me to shut it down.   More information and first impressions here:  http://youtu.be/pwnvPLMnYd4 
11893	A girl wake up in a dungeon.. Well A lot games start with that. This small 3rd person shooter is a very small horror based game that will only take less then 1 hour to complete.   The map layout and the background BGM is decent and everything else is not. The control is simple but different then just about every 3rd person shooter game I ever played. The Graphics and view angle is really weird at time. And since it's only 1 hour long there are really not that much content. About 3 different enemy in the entire game with no boss make this game really scream out for more. More content.  As for now the game itself is simple and okish. Maybe developer can learn from this experience and make better games in the future.  There are some dlc for this game but it's only guns for level one to make it easier and some different cloth for girl to wear. Really not worth the money.  Achievements are really easy to get. Just don't miss the gun on level 2,3 and 4. I couldn't die enough times and shoot enough times by the time I finished the game so I had to grind a bit for those two achievement.  3.5/10 as for right now. A bug free game for me and it does have achievement for quick 100% and trading cards. Really not that enjoy on it's own.
11894	Darkness Assault... Well, they got the second part right, at least. I bought the Gold edition with a couple of the DLC on sale awhile back. Just recently, I had a chance to play it on SquirrelPlay Live.   I soon wished I had not.   If I was feeling incredibly charitable, I'd call this a hot mess.   I'm not.  Unfortunately, the words I want to use here wouldn't even be appropriate on Death Row.  Yes, folks, it IS that bad. Between the obtuse control scheme that wants to be a Biohazard game, Unity, muddy textures, really bright lighting, a fair lack of useful options , one might be inclined to think the game was merely bad.   Not true. The game, low-poly models and all, gave my poor potato heat cancer of the video card. Even with several large fans pointed at it in such a way as even kept DOOM (2016) running smoothly, I barely got 25 frames per second with the card running flat out... Which I managed to duplicate without XSplit running.   So, atop everything else, it's also incredibly poorly optimized.  On to the story: There isn't one. You get a tired, Mario-thin premise to set the stage, and then get thrown to the proverbial wolves. You've been dropped into a cell that nobody bothered to lock, nearly immediately find both a flashlight you don't need and a nepping  gun , and then get to explore the cell bay just long enough to realize the controls are hot tapioca before the first monster hits you like a starship doing Warp 50.   I barely had time to register it's presence before expiring messily the first time, and even knowing where it was the next attempt only bought me enough time to figure out that I can't shoot on the run. One simply  must  give the enemies a sporting chance, and target them first... Should you fail to predict their location with pixel-perfect accuracy, you're going to miss.  So I died. Immediately after that, so did the game.   It wants to be hard, and is simply frustrating and destructive. Unless you're a connoisseur of carp, avoid at all costs.
11895	This is a 3D-overhead 'horror' game in the mould of Silent Hill but not nearly as good. This mode of gaming doesn't work too well on PC.   The game is polished enough and relatively bug free, but doesn't run at resolutions higher than 1080p, making it look less than attractive on a modern system.  Controls are fine, but the top down perspective isn't the best choice for this kind of game.  Gameplay itself is where things get really bad - it's fairly repetitive, not particularly fun, lame zombies that wave their arms around are repeatedly positioned in places where you'd like them not to be. Run around, pick up batteries, medkits, ammo, and just wish you were playing something else. The game doesn't really go anywhere, which makes it seem a bit half done.  Laughably, there's DLC, which really works against any goodwill you might have for developers - they can't finish a game, but they want more money for skins?
11896	Do you like mazes? Feeling lost? No!? Well too bad!! I found myself constantly lost, the map system doesn't help at all because it doesn't give you an actual usable map. I was constantly replacing batteries because the game is so dark and they run out very quickly.   This game is just corridors with more doors stabbing at your poor sore brain. Play if you want to go mad.   ps~ I played this with my own quick Antimicro config and an xbox one controller but also with 'Excision - Virus LP' playing in iTunes. This makes the game much more playable to me. Oh yeah, there is also no sound menu in-game. I cranked up iTunes and dealt with it.
11897	Horrible. Just downright horrible.  - There's hardly any zombies in the game. Kill a couple at most and then waste your time wondering about the maze like corridors. - It's pretty short. In the short length of time it'll take you to finish, there's nothing scary at all. The game completely fails at providing even an adequate 'horror' atmosphere. If anything, it becomes a comedy with all the poorly translated (the devs are Russian) dialogue and documents. - There's not much in the way of weapons as they all feel the same. - The whole point of the game is to not only escape from the dungeon you're in, but to find out why you're there. Turns out the game decides not to tell you that, and instead just ends abruptly. The devs have no plans to make a sequel (they explictly said this on the discussion section), so if you're wondering why Katrine (the character's name) is where she is, just use your imagination. - Not much in the way of enemies. I know I mentioned the lack of my zombies at my first point, but really this is a big problem. There's literally nobody here but you. What kind of horror game has no monsters? - There's just nothing to see or do here. It's devoid of any sort of immersion factor. You'll find yourself bored, unless you think the character's awkward running is funny or something.  Overall, I don't recommend it, even at its price. The only thing good about this 'game' is the soundtrack, but you want to play an actual game, not meander about while listening to music.
11898	 So after finishing game for 1 hour i can say that it is bad...very bad
11899	User interface to correct.   A lot of bugs: character stucks on door or things.  Just for cards.
11900	While it occasionally has its moments, this is not a good game, the story is fairly generic, you rarely feel in any danger of anything apart from choosing the wrong way around the maze and running out of ammo, and the main way of trying to make the game seem harder is a high camera angle which means you spend the game looking at the floor in front of your feet instead of down the corridor.  Further issues include the camera angle shifting and being blocked when you go through doors, which is also when you are most likely to encounter enemies, so you have to adapt a strategy of opening doors and then backing off so you can clearly see the enemy (of which there are only two, the zombie like experimental subjects and later security guards with night sticks). Also for a game with limited ammo, the decision to have it so picking up ammo refreshes that ammo type up to a cap is particularly annoying, it generally means you have to spot an ammo container, then use up that type of ammo clearing part of the level, then find your way back to refill.  Overall the game is playable, but it is pretty flawed and there is nothing really to recommend it particularly - apart from the very start with no weapon trying to avoid the zombies on the first level it is a horror/survival game that feels more tedious and mildly annoying than scary or horrific.
11901	From what I can see this game has mostly negative reviews, this did not stop me from giving it a chance. After playing it for only an hour I can understand why. It's very confusing, dark, and not very fun.
11902	chromatic aberration simulator
11903	I don't like this game, it feels sluggish and it doesn't allow you to customize your controls.
11904	No real positives to this game. There's really no story. You wander around this dimly lit level with corridors, doors, and rooms that are copy pasted from 1 another, without a map, or any real direction. Easy to get lost because every room, door, and hallway looks the exact same, and theres no map or marker to use for guidance. To equip or use items every time you have to press escape, then go to inventory, then click use, you know, because the most simple things should take an unnecessary amount of time. You constantly get stuck on invisible items or nothing at all, any many times I couldn't back up because......bad game. Also genius of them to use an angled overhead view, so that you really can't see anything and it makes movement and everything else super awkward and annoying. After fulfilling all mission objectives and wandering around for 10 min and no clue where to go, I just gave up. Only enjoyable part was laughing at the broken, nonsensical english. 3.5/10
11905	Wow - The Reviews were absolutely right - Run For Your Life! This is an Assault on good judegement - Reviews Are NOT Mixed - They are majority Negative. You've already read about the awful camera angle, bad mechanics, dull story.  My Dad would say, 'Never beat a dead horse,' meaning not to labor a point that's already been made. So lemme be brief.  The subtitle translations can barely pass for English. The voiceovers are comical. Anybody remember Natasha &amp; Boris Badanoff from Bullwinkle &amp; Rocky cartoons. Thats where 'Get Moose &amp; Squirrel' would come off sounding like 'Geet Mus und Skveral.' Yep, this is one lousy Russian Fail. Even though I only paid pennies for this game, it was a big waste of valuable time. You've been warned..... by most of the Reviewers on this page. Cheers
11906	The first 2 levels are actualy kind of fun, it was nice to explore the areas and find objective items. The 'survival' bits are very poor though. The game gets painstakingly repetitive after 3 missions. Luckily all the achievements are attainable within these first 3 missions. This is a game I have to take in portions, I would NOT be able to complete this game in one sitting, it would be just too boring. Although maybe 3-4 times playing the game 2 missions each time (just guessing) would be fine to beat the game. Its not super bad, but there are for sure bad/boring elements about the game. Even then, I still cannot recommend the game.   Cons - Terrible camera angles - Locked camera angle  - Boring atmosphere - Cheesy audio all around  1. Boring zombie sounds  2. Footsteps are the same sounds looped  3. Enemy dialogue is the SAME and very boring   4. Voice acting is terrible - 'Survival' aspects are very basic and not a challenege at all considering you can run past all zombies - You get stuck on alot of things, walking through doors can sometimes be tough.   Pros - Guns sound really cool  - Easy achievements  This game is only worth the achievements, all can be attained within 2 hours.
11907	I cant recommend this game at all. The game setup would had been fun but it fails to do it.. Instead i run around 3 identical levels wondering around looking for stupid notes, keys, and other things while trying to avoid monsters.. Not many weapons nor ammo. You can beat the game in an hour. For 2.99 i believe this game should had been for free.  Pros Steam trading cards top down survival horror Inventory nice concepts  Cons barely any ammo wondering around maps that are the same/identical to the prev lvls Voice acting was bad Camera angles sometimes bugged out not worth the price
11908	Things i've learned from this game: - all male zombies must wear a towel to cover their testicles - zombies will chase you while wearing thong sandals - female zombies are weaker than male zombies but they have nice,untained â¥â¥â¥â¥ anyway-&gt; call Anita Sarkeesian,thanks. - you can't actually run for more than 4 meters without having a stroke - whenever you get lost in real life you can find your way by just looking at a wolrld wide map, because FU Google Maps - all doctors are bald and insane at the same time. And they're German too. Germans are evil. - a torchlight battery lasts for 15 seconds, much more than an Iphone's battery anyway - when you want to shoot something with a gun, always aim for the sky. F**k you Pidgey. - hospitals are made by bathrooms only. Who needs to eat in 2016? We just need to take our daily dump. - all floors must be soggy and covered in blood, no matter why.  Cheesy sarcasm aside, this is trash. Torchlight or not, you can't see â¥â¥â¥â¥ anyway. Floors all look the same, except the last one. Worst aspects of this game? - plot as deep as an espresso's mug - full of clichÃ¨s - it exists - a sequel might come to steam
11909	oh god i wasted 2 hours on this QQ
11910	The worst game I've played on any platform. The graphics and the level design are terrible. There are only three levels, two of which you will have to beat twice â and this is no joke. There are only three kinds of enemies (clones, fast clones, humans). There are just three save slots. The English version is atrocious. As a translator, I find this level of localisation absolutely disgusting. The 'voice actors' obviously don't speak English themselves.  On the plus side, you can get a perfect game in about 1-2 hours (depending on whether you miss any weapons, which fact will require you to replay the game â yes, the whole game â as you can't just jump to the level of your choice), and there are trading cards.
11911	Darkness Assault was an assault upon both my senses and good judgement (I should never have bought it in the first place).  OMG! The worst thing about this game was the camera angle; it was set at something like a 45 degree behind the character, looking down towards the floor. It gave my neck an odd sensation from trying to look ahead all the time towards the area out of view (the cost to fix my neck by a physiotherapist would cost way more than the game is worth). Why, for pity's sake, why? Either use a top-down setting with a wide view, or a first person setting so you can look straight ahead. This lame-brain notion, that looking down at the floor all the time is a good idea for a game setting, is rubbish.  Speaking of rubbish, the developers should have found someone who can speak English properly to write the dialogue and text boxes. The dialogue was understandable, but poor. Not the developer's fault if English isn't their first language, but they should have hired a reputable interpreter to cover that aspect of their production.  There was probably a lot more wrong with the game, but I didn't hang around to find out.  Sorry, but I found this game a real trial to play. So I stopped, rather than inflict any more damage upon myself. I may try Darkness Assault at some later stage, once my neck has recovered, but don't hold your breath. This game gets a thumbs down from me.
11912	Probably the worst game i've ever played. I only bought it as a joke and it was so bad I couldn't even make fun of it.
11913	This game is complete and udder â¥â¥â¥â¥ the movements are buggy you cant get around the zombies and the camera view sucks i wouldnt play this game again if they paid me 1k to play it there is no effort in the creation of this game and i would rather get a cup of coffee with the money i spent on this â¥â¥â¥â¥ and i spent 60 cents on this game because i got a coupon for it if i met the creator i would punch him in his left nut(and im a pacifist) this is garbage and i wouldnt wish this game upon my worst enemies
11914	A while ago I puked on the backyard. I ain't no doctor but I'm pretty sure it was a direct consequence of playing this.
11915	Please, this game is not worth a cent. There are better games on free online game sites. This game has 5 levels that last about 10 mins of walking around and a basic shooting system. It really is not fun. Then to top it off, there's 1 achievement that you can't unlock. The only upside to this game is that the trading cards cost about half the games price so when you sell the trading cards you make money. However if you're like me and like to craft cards the cards cost around 50 cents NZ each... Would not recommend/10
11916	1 played the game. 2 got my trading cards. 3 never played again.  i got it for $0.20 and for that price i gess it kind of pays for its self with the trading cards but i dont know. its just in general not a fun game.
11917	I played for a few min and the contols were so bad i quit....no options to change them either!
11918	Probably the worst game i've ever played  2/10
11919	Hey it isn't that bad if you buy it on sale... I saw a gameplay video for an early version and that was horrible. Now? It is playable. Hardly a survival horror... but playable.  + : ehh trading cards? there isn't really a highlight of this game.. the effort perhaps.. Just if you have it, you can play it and you can complete it.  - : the worst thing is the the map just show enemies and not the map, like rooms, corridors and stuff. controls are bad, graphics and lightning is poor, enemies are bad, story and voice acting is bad.  But he fixed some things from the early version - added cinematics, fixed gun equipping...  I won't recommend it. I'm just saying I can see the effort and clap - *clap* - but that is all. Lets say the creator has left room for improvements.  3,5/10 would not wander without map again
11920	Release date = 2015. Format = PC Can you remap keys to suit your playing style? = â¥â¥â¥â¥ no.
11921	One of the worst games on Steam...  What's the point of a medkit if every attack from an enemy kills you in one hit?
11922	Probably the worst game i've ever played  2/10
11923	I played for a few min and the contols were so bad i quit....no options to change them either!
11924	The game is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ the gameplay is crap  I give it a 6/10
11925	Save your money people
11926	OK.First of all let's give some credits for the guys who made this game in Unity.I am pretty sure they put a lot of time and nerves into this game but that was not enough.Now here is my pov: -I played games from 2002 with better cutscenes. -Guns sound pretty bad.At least if there are 3 of them they should add more damage. -No backstory,you are a badass girl running around an asylum or whatever that is just to find a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ed professor. -FPS drop from time to time,and graphics like s**t. -At least there were some screaming sounds who sent chills down my spine,but just that. Overall.Dont even try to buy this game.I am horrified to see that they made a DLC for this.But if you are an achivement hunter and want to waste some time go ahead.
11927	its kinda cool but everything looks the same the story is bad and the gameplay slow, plus you move like a tank.  overall cool Idea and play style just bad follow through. but if you can get it on sale just to try or something.
11928	Fun shooting zombies. Fun stops when your ammo runs dry. (NO MELEE FFS!!)  Also, this game is too short for me.
11929	There are a lot of issues with this game.The lack of stelth,the enemies that keep folowing you no matter the distance, and the flashlight, the light can be seen gonig through the other walls and light them too(as you may see at this screenshot)!!!     http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=462978563   But it had the essensials for a... slighly horror game!!! Lack of light, resourses etc.  It would be a good game if it fix these issues!!! Good luck, i won't uninstall if it will be a better game at the next 2-3 updates!!!!   
11930	just a question, why is there lense flare ... ON A CARDBOARD BOX!!!
11931	Oh dang, shameless russian cashgrab. There is so much i dont like about this 'game'. The 3rd person top down idea is a nice style which has been tried and tested, but this game fell short. The map felt zoomed in at all times, you could not control the fixed angle or extend the distance. The lighting was horrid, i understand the game is called 'Darkness Assault' so pun, but bad design is a thing regardless. The options menu is horribly lacking when it comes to flexability. The game is playable with certain DLC packs, but vanilla it is a terrible 'survivor horror' cliche, with the Guns DLC it is a bad '3rd person action' cliche.   The game itself has a whopping 5 acts, with no big final battle, the story is confusing and feeds you nothing unless you open menus and read scraps of paper. Starts out a zombie clone game, became a cop killing game about locating professors. IMO, the only thing this game has going for it, is the rather small achievement pool and badge progression. It isnt the worst looking game out there, but the controlls are so terrible. So terrible. Straifing is a chore and combat is....well you can shoot. No melee, stamina and batteries.   It can be 100% completed within 3 hours.
11932	Terrible game, sorry for the devS but this can be an Alpha, not a full game. With 10 euros you can buy Resident Evil 4, Revelations, with 15 Hd Rebirth (one of the best).
11933	Kinda scary and buggy :/ 5/10
11934	Came for trading cards(90% off coup) stayed because I laugh at quality
11935	Terrible, I need a 'shower' after playing it for 5 minutes.
11936	This game sucks, check out my video review!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoGH493OSzs 
11937	Well, i do admit the game is bad and its not even close to be a 2015 game, it would have been a good day if it was released in 2006 or something. Because yeah ... it looks this old!
11938	(EDITED)The only reason why i bought this game was because i had the coupon and it seemed like i could get the achievements easy. Started playing it and noticed a few problems. The camera view is locked on like a half bird's eye half third person look witch makes the map look pretty annoying. Walking is increadibly slow. i noticed as soon as i got to chapter 4 that the gaurds just keept wrecking me. thats where i stopped playing the game. You dont get enough bullets to deal witht he gaurd that show up so the game's telling you that you have to just try you're best to outrun them witch never worked because id run out of stamina to fast or i''d run out of the medical bags to heal myself. although i liked the way the game looked. I liked the cut scenes during the chapter's. the voices were a little bad because you guys dont have a proper english talker's so it was a little hard to hear them sometimes so i just relied on the subtitle's.   Pro's: It's a decent looking game. Cut scene's are pretty cool to watch. Most of the steam achievement's can be done in about an hour of gameplay.  Con's: The camera is locked on in a stupid way. (wish it just had first or third person view instead of a bird/third hybrid view) 2 of the achievements are just a pain to get xD Slow walking. (perfect for the first three chapter's then it's just annoying how slow you are on the fourth chapter) Not enough ammo for the gun/s  Rating: 5/10 Just small problems that could be fixed. I would always run out of ammo trying to kill the gaurds cause i cant run away from them forever. they were EVERYWHERE!!!!
11939	A short survival horror game if you want to call it that. Most of the items are not needed such as the flashlight. There are 3 different guns you can get only real difference is rate of fire. Most of the rooms are basically all the same and the Steam Achievements are a joke. Were finishing the game should be an achievement you get some for dying a lot of times. Since I was able to finish without dying I had to go back in the game up to 25 times just to die so I can get all achievements. If I haven't gotten this game for free I would probably be upset had I paid of it. The concept isn't bad but the effort put into it is.
11940	Such a bad game. Bad story, very very bad mechanics and the gameplay is also bad. All and all, I would not reconmend this game. Even if it's cheap and you get achievements from it.
11941	'Ah, there you!' Best line of the game.
11942	Horribly game . . .
11943	I think developers who made this game are inspired from games like old Silent Hill, Resident Evil etc. and I liked that idea. Atmosphere is kinda cool but it's same in every place and voice acting sounds so fake to be honest. I didn't like the fact that player can't change controls in game because I'm a disabled person who can't use his left hand fully. So I always change running to a close key to W, A, S, D because I can't press 'shift' button. Finding map but not be able to see where you are in it is bad, especially when every place looks same. They should put more emotions, sound effects and deep musics in game. Am I dissapointed? Yes. But do I regret paying for this game? No. It didn't cost a much and hopefully supporting the developer will brought us better game/games in the future. So they should keep hard work and make better games!
11944	The controls are bad and you cannot change them. This game is supposed to be a horror game but does a really poor job at being scary.
11945	worst â¥â¥â¥â¥ing camera ever
11946	This game is as good as it is bad. I have to say; I am lost for words about this game I love it as much as I hate it. Here is why the game is SD, and they use real photos with art on it, the characters art is good, but when the whole picture is art, then it feels out of place. Like it's not the same person that have made the art, and the characters don't look the same or should I say the same art style. The music sucks it don't fit the game in any sense there is no background sound to draw you into the VNG. The menu is way too simple if you ask me I don't like it. But when all that said I have to say the story alone does all the talking. Since I'm a loner with low-self esteem, I more time than not know how he feels and can be there with him most of the way, which makes my emotions build up in me and I even try not to shed a tear from time to time. This VN game has a Dark Story to it. I was surprised since I never read anything about this game before I played it and more of the outcome was surprising which just made me love this story more. So if you don't care about the art, the music, the menu, but only the story then this will be for you, and I care about it all wish make it hard for me to decide if I want to recommend it or not.
11947	I got this game thinking this will be a decent yandere game from the reviews and everything but NO! IT WAS NOT! It is pointlessly long, so far I have gotten through 4-5 endings and all I can think of is how annoying and wimpy the main character is. I do not want to read 12 pages worth of text about how out of shape you are from living in the city now that you are visiting the countryside where transportation is not as easy every 5 minutes. Sure there were funny parts like the main character's grandpa loves wearing Hawaiian shirts under his hama and other things I will not spoil, but the main character got on my nerves that I cannot continue reading.This reminds me too much of the anime School Days, I thought this would be more like Mira Nikki or Higurashi.  So if you want to get this game, please know the main character is annoying and wimpy. 
11948	Dialogue and narration are pointlessly meandering. Lots of flashbacks to scenes that just happened, and the main character ruminating on them, revealing nothing that wasn't implicit in the scenes already.  Characters don't come off as authentic. They feel like stock characters written through the view of the author's nostalgia goggles.   Art is ..... bad.  The few endings I read through didn't seem to do much beyond genre expectations.  There's a slim chance that the other endings were fantastic and I just missed out, but the prospect of slogging through that text again wasn't tempting.  If you want a long-winded, predictable yandere game, it's for you. But anything more and you'll be disappointed.
11949	 Honest review after 40 hours
11950	After 20 days, I can safely say.  This game did not meet its promises  at all.  This feels rushed.  This doesn't feel Mafia. This doesn't feel like the third sequel we're waiting for.  This feels like 'one man army badass takes over county' style. And trust me, its literally that.  I saved up a few months of money just to get this, and i'm in EXTREME Regret. (Note, Exagherrated really badly.)  Please, don't let your wallet cry that its money was spent on this.  k real review â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up so rip. also missions are repetitive, go kill this guy, wait for leader, EH.  only reason im doing it is cus of le storyline
11951	It took me almost 23h but I finished it. Here's what I think about it after beating it.  Pros: - Really cool atmosphere of 60s. Huge detailed city and great soundtrack add to it quite a bit. - Solid story with great characters and awesome voice acting. - Solid game mechanics - shooting, driving, cover system, etc - all works well, but there's nothing really new about them.  Cons: - My biggest gripe with it - it doesn't make you feel like you are mafia - AI is pretty much brain dead. Especially if you are using stealth approach. - Repetitive samey side-quests that are forced onto you as gates to main quests - Poor optimisation (performance-wise this game sucks on most machines, even after a bunch of patches) - Little variety of cars and guns - Lots of things hidden behind unlocks that are too boring to achieve (wanna get that rocket launcher? be ready to do more side quests, if you are not sick from them yet!) - Game has a bunch of pretty meaningless unlocks, instead of giving you fun stuff (e.g. unlock to steal cars quietly, that comes after an ability to call in car delivery) - No fast travel - and since city is big, be ready to spend quite some time traveling around  And in general, the game feels as if they didn't have enough time to finish the game properly. If they'd allow only doing story missions (the most fun part) and beating the game in ~6h or so - it'd be so much better in my opinion.  Unfortunately, now you have to fight those boring gate-quests to get to fun stuff. Which is.. well, not fun. I definitely wouldn't recommend buying it at full price. Maybe once it's heavily discounted.  See more detailed explanation of all points (along with some gameplay) in the video:  https://youtu.be/S1Q84XeixcM 
11952	I've updated the review after finally beated the game. Just in case, I'll say it. This is my review and nothing but my opinion. Feel free to agree or disagree as long as you respect it.    The bad. Part 1. 30fps never dies.
11953	[May contain spoilers!] Mafia III is an open world crime game set in the year 1968. You play as Lincoln Clay, a Vietnam war veteran out for revenge for the killing and betrayal of his family. I don't write many reviews but I felt like I needed to let people know what's up with this game, without talking about graphics.   The World
11954	First and foremost, let me be clear, I have been a massive fan of the Mafia series ever since the first installment, it was amazing and the realism/immersion was incredible with the speed limit, indicators, fuel, stuff like that, so you can understand I was VERY excited when I heard about this game.  Now, lets skip forward to just a few days ago when I finally got the game I was so eager to play... to say I was disappointed would be an understatement. I am VERY unhappy with how Hangar 13 has failed in keeping up with the quality and attention to detail we came to love in Mafia 2.  I also apologise if my review is 'TL:DR' but details are important in a review. The following are the reasons why I don't recommend Mafia 3.  1: No fuel. The Fuel system in the previous Mafia games added a level of immersion that we hadn't seen before, it was what made it different from other similar games.  2: No speed limit. Previous Mafia games had an enforced speed limit, if the cops saw you going too fast they came after you lights and all, but in Mafia 3 you can buzz past the police as fast as you want and they won't even bat an eyelid.  3: No Indicators. This isn't a HUGE feature but it added immersion and that is very important in a game like Mafia. Previous Mafia games you used the indicator by holding left or right while in a vehicle, but none of that in Mafia 3.  4: Graphic issues. You will frequently see that the transition from day to night is VERY quick, sometimes its instant you just see it go from dark to light in seconds. The skybox at sunset and dawn is U.G.L.Y, it just looks horrible.  5: Car Flipping. Just like in GTA if your car rolls over you can just roll it back over and drive off, in the previous Mafia games you could not do that, you had to get a new car which is FAR better and much MUCH more immersive.  6: Combat. In Mafia 3 it feels as if you are fighting the same fight over and over again, much of the buildings are simply copy/pasted and it gets very boring. Especially when all you have to do is hide, whistle and stab, thats it.  7: Weather. Mafia 3 has no real weather. Yes it rains, but thats it, either rain or sun, no snow, no ice, no fog, nothing, I understand its New Orleans but it still snows in New Orleans. Especially when it comes to driving, Mafia 2 has snow and ice and that affected how your car handled, even NPC's slipped and fell over on the ice.  There are plenty other small things that made the previous Mafia games so much better than Mafia 3.  Such as, shooting hub caps, repairing engines, customising car in garage, random NPC, actual MAFIA not this Haitian bullsh*t, Can't interact with phonebooths, Police are nerfed in Mafia 3, No car wash, Can't use car trunk and finally NO BLOODY FOOTPRINTS!! (You also can't interact with the small things like sinks, toilets, lights, fridges and windows like you could in the previous games).  So I think I have made my point, Mafia 3 is NOT a Mafia game. Yes it has the name and the same devs, but I refuse to believe THIS heap of sh*t is what they had in mind after all these years.
11955	Well, I have been reading through most reviews, positives and negatives and none of them seems to match my fellings about this game, so I decided to write one myself. I'll List pros, cons and neutrals and give my conclusions at the end of the review. Maybe its just luck but I haven't experienced a single CTD and only very few fps drops (After the fps patch they seem to become more common, but still manageable) and one small freeze.  I'll update the review at each new patch or fix released.  Pros: + Catching story and interesting historical setting + Good voice acting and facial animations. + Great atmosphere and city. Makes you feel inside the game and the historical context + AMAZING soundtrack. 60's rock, blues, jazz and country all the way fitting perfectly with the overrall setting. + Interesting characters, rich dialogues and the plot seems consistent so far even if sometimes its feels rushed. + Impressive lightining effects even though there still some bugs and some people that dislike it. + Cinematic narrative. It feels like you are watching a documentary about your character life and impact on New Bordeaux crime scene.  Neutrals: . Driving Mechanic. I personally like it, as it seems like real driving but I guess a lot of people will not think like me. . Somewhat strange animations. (Getting into or out of cover, Lincoln running with a gun and pedestrians animations are particularly weird.) . A not-so-free world. Even though you can just hang around the city without any specific objective there isnt much to do outside the missions and collectables (It seems there will be patches to fix this, wich reinforces my final conclusion) . Racket System gets repetitive too soon. . Cluttered UI. I can go past it, but it's really annoying sometimes. . Textures are not high-ended and polished as one could expect from a 2016 AAA game but it doesn't mean they are ugly!  Cons: - Grainy and often foggy graphics. (The fps patch released on 10/08 adress this, it looks much better now but still an issue) - Step back from Mafia I and II. Shops, bars, clubs are useless even though they are marked on the map, policemen dont care if you are driving 120mph, cargoes dont get damaged etc. These small bits of realism that made the Mafia series unique are absent. - Very restricted field of view (remember GTA 3 and VC? That the map loading was so slow that you could go to someplace before it was even loaded?) (10/09 Update: Fps update adress this as well, it looks reasonable now) - Notable graphic quality drop from cutscenes to actual gameplay.  - FPS lock (30 fps in 2016? Seriously?!) (Even if now there is a patch for that it still a HUGE flaw for a pc game coming out with a 30fps lock) - Bizarre night and day cycle. There's no in-game clock (at least I haven't seem one) and day/night cycles looks totally random for me. - Bizarre control scheme (Why not use GTA scheme?) (I play on a controller btw, things seem shitier for keyboard users) - Very Dumb AI. Enemies and NPC's both. - Overral feeling that you are a playing a BETA and not a finished game. Especially because the next patches will bring things that should already be in the game (as outfit changing, street races, interactive shops etc)  Conclusions:  1) Mafia III is a consistent game with a lot of potencial. Maybe even GOTY potencial, but this pc release is the worst since Arkham Knight (maybe even messier than that one). It seems to me the game was about 80% finished at release date but they released it all the way. Maybe with the coming patches and fixes Mafia III comes up and fulfill all its potencial. So far I can't reccommend this game to anyone and my veredict is that Hangar 13 and 2K just went lazy after the good pre-release sales. Actually I would give it a 6/10 but it has potencial to hit as high as 9/10 or higher.  2) This game doesn't seem to fit the Mafia franchise. Dont get me wrong, Mafia III is a potencially awesome game, but it just seems to me that it doesnt fit the franchise at all! The tiny little details that made Mafia an unique and awesome series are lost. Mafia III feels more like a mix of GTA general idea with Shadow of Mordor mechanics and the complex LA Noire history than one of the Mafia games. And the change of perspective (though I can understand it as Lincoln Clay is perfect for the setting proposed) still bites me.  3) DONT PRE-PURCHASE!!! Pre-purchasing ANYTHING is just plain dumb. You are giving away your money in exchange for the promise of a product and NOT for the product itself. This is destructive to any kind of industry as the quality tends to drop as the profitability of that product is already guaranteed before the product even exists. And in my humble opinion this is exactly what happened with Mafia III. A game that was released rushedly and unfinished, with no concern to customer satisfaction as a healthy profit was already safe and sound way before the release date.
11956	As much as I wanted to like it, I simply cant. The starting story (the first 20 ish minutes of the game was the best parts, and for 15 of those minutes it's a cutescene and for the other 5 you're in a bank). The story dies off and is followed up by repetitive gameplay doing the same thing over and over again but with different looking enemies.  Step 1: Deal damage.  Step 2: Kill officers. Step 3: Kill distict bosses. Step 4: Make higher ups angry and then kill them (also they spawn in the same place, not even a new area).  Step 5: Repeat steps 1-4 about 6 or more times and then call it a game.  Also it's great when the vehicles and ai glitch making it lag and having explosions everywhere. The ai of this game invented drifing 100% All in all not worth $60 in the slightest. More around $30 ish. Just play dishonered 1 or 2. They are much better. 
11957	Would rather buy Winrar
11958	I was super hyped for this game after the second game and I didn't mind the awful graphics and the 30fps lock. I could see past the fact that my 970 couldn't make it to 60FPS but the fact your game is so buggy that I cannot start the final mission after restarting the game twice is just ridiculous for 2016.   It is disappointing to have to give this game the thumbs down due to it's lack of story and very very repetitive missions after you finish Sammy's missions. It is locked at 30fps and you can unlock it to unlimited but I can't get a stable 60fps with a GTX 970 and the graphics definitely are not impressive enough to demand such a high spec. The game has almost no customization options unlike the previous titles and you can only unlock certain cars. It is the biggest disappointment of 2016 for me and the developers should be ashamed of releasing a product in this state. If I try and complete the mission 'My Name is Lincoln Clay' I can no longer progress in the game and it appears to be bugged.   I'll give an example of how repetitive the game is  Mission 1  - Meet Associate 1 - Destroy building for Associate 1 - Kill Enforcer for Associate 1 - Kill District leader and give control to Associate 1  Mission 2  - Meet Associate 2 - Destroy Store, Truck, Building for Associate 2 - Kill Enforcer for Associate 2 - Kill District leader and give control to Associate 2  Mission 3  - Meet Associate 3 - Small Story Cutscene - Small Story Mission  - Small Story Cutscene  Once you have done this and completed all missions for the associates you will be forced to do it again for the entire game because it never changes and they have absolutely 0 creativity in mission design. All of the story missions feel like side missions. The side missions are more interesting than the main story missions.  As a Mafia game it's the worst in the series for me but as a standalone game it's good but not worth full price so I'd say wait for a sale.  This game is the biggest disappointment for me in 2016.
11959	There's not a single good thing that I can say about this game.  The story is supposed to be good but it just isn't! An orphan came back from the war and fights racist criminals who killed his homies. That's it. That their story. I don't know about you, but I didn't expect this lackluster from a Mafia title. And the developers have told the story and shown most of the cutscenes on their youtube channel anyway. Gameplay is unbelievably repetitive, everything feels the same, like running in circles. Or rather walking very slowly. There's usually just a single animation for each action and it gets very annoying watching it over and over and over and over and over and over ... again. Driving cars is not enjoyable in this game and you'll be driving a lot. I was quite disappointed that there's no cockpit view. I mean we've seen it in promo videos how Clay switches the gears and tunes his radio but there's none on that in the game. Also you cannot customize cars thought you could in a previous game. NPCs react unrealistically to hero's actions. I broke into a closed empty club at night and there was just one girl dancing non-stop paying no attention what-so-ever to me until I shot her. Bystanders run straight towards the player to call the police and enemies can't see Clay right in front of them in stealth. Graphics are insultingly bad. Textures are a blurry mess, sky is the worst I've seen in any game. It can turn bright orange in the middle of the night and it changes in such a weird way that you question the state of mind of programmers responsible for that all the time. How did they manage that game looks worse than games from ten years ago is beyond me. Soundtrack which I've already heard in a hundred other Vietnam themed games and movies is great. But it was created half a century ago by people that have nothing to do with Hangar 13. And last but not least. The centerfold girls are the same ones that were in the previous game... It's not that costly to do a new photo shoot of girls in 60s interiors. Overall game feels like a lazy cash grab. I'm very disappointed.
11960	Mediocre throughout.  Incredibly repetitive Very bad AI The more fleshed out, 'end of chapter' missions are underwhelming. Locations and concept is excellent, execution in terms of mission design and gameplay seems rushed or cut for most missions. It feels like cool stuff was planned to happen in many of the story missions, but then due to time or other constraints, they had to cut them and replace them with the same, boring, uninspiring shooting that happens throughout the game Story isn't that good as reviews make it out to be, I think most of them just try to sound balanced and piggyback on the story to have some pros to mention as well.  Excellent facial animations, soundtrack, sound design in general and environment/level design.   Whole load of bugs and some of the dumbest keybinds I've yet to see in PC games (some of them corrected with a patch that came out 2 days after the game was launched)  Shame, it's like they built a cool world to explore, but then filled it with 50+ hours of the most boring and buggy content imaginable.  Hope they learn from this mess and build a great Mafia IV.  4/10. RIP
11961	I have here writing my first review of any game on Steam, and I have to say, I am a huge fans of the Mafia series since 2002 the Mafia: City of Lost Heaven.  This, this Mafia 3, is very very dissapointing. I try to avoid mentioning the graphical side of things.  Pros: -Bigger map, unique settings. -A lot enterable building assets. -Slightly more stuff to do in between story mission; collectables etc.  Cons: -Boring revenge story, every player know exact how its going to be with little to no surprise. -Gameplay graphics differ to cutscene graphics, it tricke dme to believe the game is really that good in the first hour of the game. -Low resolution texture, on Par with Mafia 2 which is years ago. -Extremely repetitive, same side/main story, same way to take over some places throughout the game. -The AI is stupid, a single silenced pistol can takout the whole place and the AI wouldn't even notice. -Minor physics clipping problem -Character animation is lacking; e.g. Flipped cars and character just magically pops out.  This game feels like a major backwards compare to the prevous two. The Mafia stuff were almost non-existent, the character face animation is great but it doesn't makeup the lackluster story.  If you really like the Mafia series or have spare money to spend, you can consider buying this game.  Otherwise, you should wait for discount sales or avoid this game.  Edit (9 Oct):  After seeing some video compare Mafia 3 to 2 and 1, I have to add this part in.  In Mafia 1,  -You can ride the tram -You can deform you car using a single bat -When you break the car glasses and the glass remains on the floor -The bullet sheels were visible on the ground -You can refill at the gas station -The police actually catches you but not kill you  In Mafia 2, -You can fix your broken car -You can freely customise you car -You can change clothes as you wish -You can close the god damn door -Tons of minor detail include you can flush the toilet and turn off the light -You can see yourself in the mirror -You can open the hood and trunk -When the glass brakes you can see them have physics -Blood trail after walked over a dead body -You can actually have a fight with people -You have to work the door to steal a car -The police will arrest you instead of killing you -You can bride the police -You have extra activity to do in the game like buy food and clean your shoes  None of them were in Mafia 3.   Edit 2 (10 Oct): Contains Spoilers  Now that I have beaten the game, the story are really no surprise, and same as what the devs told you. Your goal is to kill Sal Marcano and guess what? you did kill him and that's the end of the game. You can continue to play tha game but there are nothing left to do.   -You can go collect all the remaining collectables i.e. Playboys, Hot Rods and keep wiring stuff. -You can keep robing people -You can... er.... drive around in the city  And that's about it.  Also you can start over again if you wanted to.    vvvvvv Possible Spoilers vvvvvv     Well actually you have a few choices for the ending,  1: Leave the city after Sal's dead. 2: Rule the citywith your underbosses. 3: Rule the city alone which kills all your underbosses in a cutscene only.  The biggest difference are the ending scene which the speachs of Father James and the other detactive were different.      ^^^^^^^^ Possible Spoilers ^^^^^^^^    Would love to see more improvements and add more details to the game. I couldn't even let Clay go to bed or sit or eat, how could he possibly survive?
11962	My Thoughts after 6-7 hours:  Wonderful writing, a great soundtrack, well done atmosphere and great voice work are brought down by tons of technical issues, underwhelming graphics, repetitive missions, balance issues and breain-dead AI. Not the worst game ever, but not close to the best either, some aspects are improved over mafia 2, but many design decisions makes me scratch my head. I am starting to feel bored with the gameplay and mainly only playing more to see how the wonderful story/cut scenes play out.  Once the open world stuff opens up, it gets really repetitive which is a shame as the story is interesting and the atmosphere is great. I honestly wish they would just keep it linear and focused on the story not so much side quests, like Mafia 1/2, Sleeping Dogs and LA Noire did. Play to you're strong suit, which is story and linear missions! Mafia 3 Could have used more time in the oven so to speak. The first 3/4 hours the game seems like it will be great, but doing this same stuff over and over again for taking over these bases, gets very boring.  I went back and forth between positive or negative review, as my opinion on the game has been so up and down. I just hope the story stuff continues to be good for the whole game, I will add more to this review when I finish the game, the thumbs down could turn to thumbs up, but the bad aspects of this game really are a shame as some aspects are very well done, just not a very well rounded product. Also what is up with the skybox and the rain effects? They look ps1 or snes quality.   If I had to score it right now it would be a 6/10, it does some stuff so damn good that it is so sad when all the other stuff fails so hard. For me personally this is probably the most dissapointing game for me since Batman Arkham Knight. Wanted it to be good so bad, but there is just so much wrong with this game.
11963	Request to 2KGames: To be honest, I would rather pay $60 for a remastered HD version of Mafia1 on Steam, with some added content; than pay $60 for Mafia3. Which is supposed to not look as aged as it does upon release in 2016. +ADD FREE ROAM EXTREME DLC.  The game is medicore. It's just a plain and simple game. I've played Mafia 1, 2, 3. Played all of the games to death (Collectiables, etc). Why didn't they re-add FreeRoam Extreme or anything. Continue or New Game; only options clickable at main menu. It seems like a downgrade to me coming from Mafia 2 to say the least. The combat is average, death animations are meh (~3 for every gun/melee), driving is like Watch Dogs/Godfather and car damage is...no. Reminds me of Godfather 2 car damage and combat with a mixture of Saints Row 3 HUD from console days.   The sky is choppy and pixelated, no option for draw distance - can't turn off Ambient Occlusion. When Lincoln Clay gets hit by a driving car, he doesn't fall to the ground, rag doll doesn't take place: stationary standing still and says 'UGH.' You just got hit by a car, fall to the floor or do some kind of animation. Not just UGH. Clay can also exit a moving car at 90mph and roll to a safe standing pose with no damage being dealt. Didn't know Lincoln Clay was part of the Marvels squad. Fascinating. So much arcade present. We didn't ask for Joe's Adventures (M2), and yet you released it with a DLC cost. I watched and responded to people on the 2K forums, asking why you're adding point systems into the game. This isn't an arcade game, Mafia1 wasn't an arcade point game. It was story driven with cutscenes I will always remember. Do not do the same for Mafia3 as you did for the Mafia2 DLC.   Feel like I'm at the Coin Arcades back in the 1990's looking for quarters to play House of the Dead. The half cutscenes (when talking to NPC/non important people) just look blurry and terribly scripted. Really just appears they put the game together too quickly. Nothing flows or feels like you want to come back to the game; nothing drags you back wanting to play more. Has very nice movie cutscenes, and that's about it. Mafia3 holds your hand through everything - telling you where to go from driving to an objective, pop ups during missions literally explaining what you have to do, to icons being on the car door. Icons everywhere, icons on everything, icons ICONS ICOONS. Where's the adventure? Where's the sense of mystery? Playing on Hard difficulty, they could have made the game HARDER and get rid of all the icons and additional help with this difficulty selected.  Majority of 'missions' are go to point A, rough up X guy, go back and talk to guy C afterwards. It's a blast. The games' world isn't feeling alive. I feel like an 8 year old being taught how to play video games for the first time. Rain doesn't splash off cars, water looks meh, no first person option or change 3rd person view height. Character has the stamina of a 100 year old that has some how survived after 3 packs of smokes a day (get more stamina through certain underboss perks, which is also dumb).  Cops. Not doing their job. What else is new though. Aren't pulling people over or getting into gun fights with NPCs. How unrealistic. Cops billy-clubbing everyone back in that day without question. Billy-club now, question maybe later; maybe not. Ontop of that, enemy AI is plain horrific.. Did they copy paste from Mafia1 AI? Probably the only thing they took out of M1. All the player has to do is crouch stealth through all the missions. No NPC will notice you if you stealth kill - so easy. When you get the silenced handgun you can literally crouch and 1 tap every enemy without difficulty. I've hi-jacked a car in front of a patroling cop (walking on sidewalk), speed, fly through red lights, just about anything illegal in front of a cop; nothing happens. For some reason a little blue cursor looking thing pops up every time I pass a cop, but what's it for? Who knows. I'm not wanted and I just commited at least 10 moving violations/felonies.   Enemy AI/Hitman will shoot at me outside of a mission, and cop does nothing on the street. Everything that M1/M2 had to offer, is no longer valid. You can't fix your cars up at the shop, put superchargers on them (Mafia2), store them (no house just compounds with nothing to do), no weapon customization, no era changing buildings or rooms (M2), get pulled over for speeding; nothing. I don't really know why they took so much content out of this game. What made Mafia, Mafia; is not there.  I'll always remember moments from Mafia1/Mafia2 story; Mafia3 not so much memorable. Chasing after Frank in M1, Hotel bomb plant in M2, M3 is just meh.  27' BenQ XL2720Z AMD 8-Core FX-8350 ASUS Crosshair V Formula-Z SAPPHIRE Nitro R9 390 8GB (512-Bit) G.Skill Ripjaws X 8GB DDR3 1866 Corsair Force Series GS SSD DEEPCOOL CAPTAIN 240EX
11964	***UPDATE***: Since the 1.2gb patch that was released just recently, the FPS limit can be set to 60, and even unlocked completely in the options menu. Some other of my issues have also been resolved (I've stricken the points that no longer apply). I will keep my negative review up because I still don't feel it is quite where it should be just yet, in terms of the port work. Expect a revised review with future patches.  ***ORIGINAL***:  One of the laziest ports of a AAA-game I've seen in years.   So, the game seems pretty interesting. Likeable characters, great animations, fantastic soundtrack, okay graphics, etc. I haven't nearly played enough to review the gameplay or story yet.  What I AM able to say something about, is the PORT work. And boy is this one lazy. I'll jot my main issues down in points:    1. You all know about the 30 FPS lock by now. And yes it is a fact. The game is currently locked at 30 FPS. Either I've gotten so used to playing with my 144hz monitor over the past few years that my eyes have grown too accustomed to high-FPS play... Or something is wrong here. Something just feels off about how Mafia 3 runs. Like, it doesn't only run at 30 FPS; the gameplay just feels soggy and sluggish. Like everything's drenched in syrup.   2. There's mouse acceleration or smoothing or something going on, because the mouse movement is irritatingly imprecise. You're unable to disable that, of course.  3. Graphics options are laughably vague. Anti Aliasing choices, for example, are either 'Low', 'Medium' or 'High'. How hard would it be to give us the exact numbers? What is High, exactly? Is x8? What type of Anti Aliasing is it? FXAA? MLAA? MSAA?   4. Controls options are very limited, and the default settings are odd to say the least. While sneaking, you can whistle to attract the attention of enemies. Guess what button that's mapped to. Seriously, take a guess. Guess anything! I can guarantee you won't get it right. Guaranteed. Okay, have you guessed already? You ready for the answer? Ready? Okay. Delete. The default button to whistle while you're sneaking, is DELETE. Now, you can remap that button, but the fact that it's set to Delete just says something about how little the developers cared about making a proper port for the PC.   5. Further control issues; You can't map the mouse thumb buttons for anything. That is a HUGE offense for me. I use my thumb buttons in every game, and not being able to in 2016 is just odd. I accepted it back in the mid-2000s when thumb buttons were still 'new' and not everybody had them on their mice. Today, there's no excuse for it.   6. There's no way to disable UI elements like the compass/map, the 3D navigation and so on. Minor gripe, but worth noting if you like customizing how the HUD looks.  7. The auto-centering during driving snaps into action really fast, and it's not possible to disable it. So if you're the kind of person who likes to look around while you're driving, you're going to get annoyed fast; you'll be fighting the camera with your mouse constantly.  8. You can change your graphics options in the launch menu before you actually boot up the game. Except the changes don't apply so you have to change them all again once the game has started. 'Luckily', there are only about five or so graphics options to choose between, ALL of which have the same choices; Low, Medium or High.  9. You have to adjust the edges of your screen when you launch the game for the first time. Why? Can't the game just detect that on its own? Another miniscule gripe, but it just adds to the whole feeling of lackluster interest for making a good port by the devs.  10. As mentioned lots of places already; the game does not support native 1920x1080 resolution. It's upscaled from what one would assume to be 800p (ie Xbox One standard). You can force it to look at least slightly sharper through the Nvidia control panel, but not nearly good enough to warrant that 30 FPS cap 'for performance's sake'. I haven't seen a big game not being able to run at native 1080p resolution in over a decade now. It is absolutely puzzling to me why they would do this.   11. Remapping buttons is risky business, apparently. I remapped some buttons (like the weapon wheel), to Y. I just wanted it out of the way, really, as I won't be using it much. That is, until a tutorial message popped up, informing me that I could use Y to open the weapon wheel. I couldn't exit out of the message through any other way than hitting Y to open the wheel. Because the game needs to make sure that you aren't too stupid to understand what it had just told you, so it forces you to do exactly what it tells you. Alright, I'll play along. Y. Nothing. Y again. Y Y Y Y Y Y. Nope, it won't work. I can't get past it. I try hitting every single button on the keyboard, but nothing happens. I eventually just ALT-F4 and call it a night. F#$K this.    So, there's my early impressions of the port of the game. It's not abysmal, it's not unplayable (I haven't had any crashes yet). But it's lazy, and you can tell that the developers (or publishers) threw this port together in a hurry to make a buck, rather than showing the PC version the respect it deserves.   There's a good game in here, it would seem. You just have to fight a lot of unnecessary battles to be able to enjoy it. And I wouldn't currently recommend it at full price on the PC. Let's see if they get that 30FPS lock fixed first.
11965	I have to say im disappointed with this game. Most of the reviews you read will all say they dont like it because the fps was at 30 (before recent patch), for me though even after the patch I can't get into it.     To start, the game is remarkably different from the second. For someone who really enjoyed the second game this is a shame. The characters you meet in this game are people you will forget very quickly, unlike Mafia ll (Joe,Henry).     Mafia 3 starts off well but hits a low point when you start doing some of the missions. They are very repetitive and boring. Its all the same, go here interrogate this guy, do $20,000 in damage, 'boss'. After doing this a few times and spending 6 hours on this game,I found myself losing interest.    For someone who hasn't played any of the previous Mafia games, it might be worth to checkout. For people who have played the others though, Personally I can't recommend this game. Not because of performance, graphics, just because the story and missions are not that rewarding, In my opinion at least.
11966	This game isnt exactly a game of the year in my opinion, but ill make a list below of positives and negatives. Remember, these are only my opinions.   Positive
11967	Nevermind the 30 FPS. (Fixed in patch 1.01)  - No saving, only one constantly overwriting checkpoint system. Want to re-play a mission or go for different decision? Well, you better start the game all the way from the start again then. - Contains a ton of incredibly lazy and boring, unskippable cutscenes where Clay talks with one of the minor story characters. All of them shot from exactly same camera angle, which never moves, and neither do the characters. They give no info related to the main story and did I mention they are unskippable. - Hold [DEL] as a default keybind. (Default keybindings have been improved in patch 1.01) - Game fails to detect native screen resolution. Was set 1600 x 900 on my 1920 x 1080 screen. - In-game options can't handle using Steam overlay. Enabling and then disabling Steam overlay while options menu is on closes the option menu, even if you are in middle of making changes. - Rolling menus, yes, you must wait for the menu to roll past Kill list, Assets, Journal tabs to get to Options. - All weapon stats in percentages, including ammo capacity. Freaking love these revolvers with 15% and semi auto pistols with 31% ammo capacity. - Mouse sensitivity settings are a mess. Mouse sensitivity in menus is extremely high, bringing sensitivity down to usable levels in menus brings in-game sensitivity to unusably low. Menu mouse behaviour also suffers from mouse de-acceleration. - The game has a backlighting profile for Logitech RGB keyboards, which only makes things worse. Just three red vertical stripes, does not illuminate keys that are actually bound for gameplay functions. - Lock opening QTE gets repetitive and old really fast. - Looks horrible because everything on screen is softened/blurred so heavily. For example faces at about 20 meter distance are blurred into solid brown blobs. No sharpness anywhere. No combination of graphics settings seems to fix this. - Death and money mechanics. When you die, instead of 'loading last save' you lose 50% of your money and you continue with whatever ammunition you had when dying. Respawned with 5 ammo on the pistol and 3 on SMG. -&gt; Go buy more ammo before getting back to action. - Camera positions when driving are way too low. There are near, medium and far camera positions, but none of them actually are set high enough to be properly able to see in front of you. This also adds to the bad looking graphics when ground textures are viewed from a flattened angle. - Deadlocked traffic jams that break 'follow that car' missions. - Badly executed subtitles where long blocks of text are often cut in middle of sentences and the timings are off.   Mafia III manages to implement usability problems I've never even seen before. It is incredible that they have managed to put effort into making things worse from usability point of view.

11968	EDIT: I just beat the game so I decided to reformat the review and add any final thoughts  I never got around to playing Mafia 1 but I loved everything about Mafia 2 back in the day. The gritty realism, the somewhat unique story, and all the small mechanics that made the world feel so real and different from the other sandbox games at the time. If I had to choose right now, I would probably play it over GTA 4. Because of this, I got relatively excited for this iteration. I avoided every trailer, gameplay video, and blog post to not get my hopes up so that I could have an ubiased and uninformed play through this game. But after only a day of playing I have realized that this is a poor mans GTA for a rich mans price.  Pros:  - Story: The beginning, ending, and some of the story missions in between are very well done and will motivate some people to get through the repetitiveness of the game - Setting: I don't remember any games that take place in the racist South during the 60s, playing as a black man on top of that just sweatens the deal - Soundtrack: Every time I play a game like Fallout, Mafia or GTA I love the soundtrack. This game is no different. However, it is a let down that there are only three radio stations to choose from - Characters: The personality for each main and side character is unique and very well done. And their voice acting is top notch. I wasn't suprised to see the long list of voice actors in the credits because no one sounds identical - Cutscenes: Every time a cutscene starts I have to sit back and just appreciate how good they look. Other than some small shadow and clipping issues, the character models and facial animations are amazingly done. However, this is also a negative because once you get back into the game it brings home how ugly it is  - Story Missions: The only interesting and unique missions are the story missions which take place after taking over a district. There are around 12 of these missions (not all of them are good) with boring filler missions in between each one  Cons: - Graphics: This game is ugly. The intro cutscene got me excited to delve into a nice looking game, but it is obvious that this is a console port once you actually start playing. It's almost comparable to a mid gen PS3 game. Where are the GTA 5 level graphics that are shown in the cutscenes? I found that the only time this game looks good is at very specific times of the day, and at night. For about 95% of the day, the sun is blindingly bright and washes everything out - Pop in: This ties into the graphics. Cars and objects pop into view about 50 yards ahead of you, which makes driving really fast in the oncoming lane very dangerous. The pop in is even more evident in the rearview mirror. A wall of brown chases you and swallows everything 50 yards behind you - Audio: Everything is cranked up to the max. No matter how far away someone is yelling from you, it sounds like they are right next to you. This makes it very difficult to track down the last guy you have to kill - Driving: I don't even know what happened here. I've tried both driving modes and simulation mode is the most playable, but they both feel like you're driving an arcadey tank that can just plow through any car. I can hit an oncoming car at 100mph and take no damage but slightly nudge a stationary vehicle and almost die - Missions: There are four different types of missions that are repeated throughout the entire game. It's either: kill/interrogate this person or steal/destroy something. And all of the racket boss missions reuse the same buildings so there are no more collectibles or money stacks to find and pick up after the first visit - AI: I can't remember the last game that had AI this stupid. They can't see more than two feet infront of them so every mission leads to me running around stealth killing everyone without ever getting caught. And if you get bored of that and want to shoot some people, have fun with enemies that run at you in the open or poke their head out of the same cover until you shoot them. And once you get a silenced weapon the game becomes a joke. You can clear out an entire warehouse without being careful and no one will notice. Two enemies were next to each other talking and I killed one and the other guy kept talking while he took his gun out and walked around for a bit. No reaction to his friend being shot in the head right infront of him  - Cops: Are cops even in this game? Throughout the entire game I only had to deal with them when the story forced it. I have driven through red lights, in the oncoming lane, going 100mph, right infront of a police station and gotten nothing more than a little police awareness bar. I've also gone on a massacre and killed everyone in an area and nothing came from it. Witnesses to a crime will run past a cop to get to a phone booth instead of just telling the officer that's walking by - Customization: I thought I hadn't gotten far enough into the game yet, but no, there is absolutely no customization. There isn't a clothing store or garage in site so you're stuck with Lincoln's army jacket, and car upgrades are purely performance and not cosmetic - Weather: The skybox rivals that of old N64 games and the rain is ugly. The most obvious and possibly the ugliest part of the game is that the time of day changes in waves instead of gradually. If you're driving fast enough you can actually race the time change and stay on the line between morning and afternoon. It is very distracting when it's bright out and then suddenly a wave of darkness comes over everything - FPS: Before the patch, I was holding a consistent 30fps. But since changing it to 60fps I have been bouncing between 24-39fps. My rig is fully capable of running a game like this at max settings at over 60fps. Be upfront with your costumers and tell them that you haven't optimized the game to run at 60fps, instead of leading us on like this - The Interviews: The idea of having present day interviews with characters from the game was very interesting. But they didn't know when to stop. Between every mission they felt like they had to have a short interview cutscene, which really breaks the immersion of the game. And there were some parts of the game where I was thinking how the hell I was going to pull the mission off. But then you are promptly interrupted by an interview that spoils the entire mission and that everything went to plan. From the very beginning of the game you already know what happens to Lincoln and Sal because of what Father James says in his interviews  Overall: This game is a huge disapointment. It has its ups and down like any game but its ups don't carry it very far. I miss the days of Mafia 2 with all its little details that showed how much the devs cared. Cars had fuel, you could shop at or rob every open store, stores closed for a day if the employees were killed, cops punished you for breaking traffic laws, cops kept track of your license plate and clothing so that you had to change them, and every mission was vital  to the story and didn't feel like a filler side mission. The thing about this game is that it does nothing new. The story, while enjoyable, is very predictable. And every game mechanic that is present or missing has been done 100 times better before. The Godfather 2, which is a 7 year old game, accomplished more than this game. Wait until a huge patch comes out, or until the game is at most $30. Hangar 13 and 2K, thank you for treating a huge demographic as second class citizens with this abysmal and lazy port
11969	This game was praised by all the game magazines waaay before it's release.  Don't get mislead by the title. The previous two 'Mafia' games let you play a Mafioso. Now you play some random black person hunting down the mob.  So now I got a few hours into it:  PRO: - GREAT music. if you like the genre - decent story  Cons: - LESS content than Mafia 2 - NO new game mechanics. Nothing. Could be a 2010 sandbox game, or earlier. - Repetitive missions. Main quests feel like sidequests. Redundant.  Get it on a sale and you're ok. But don't buy 60 bucks for it.  Edit: Here, some dude made a video comparing Mafia 2 to Mafia 3. Now keep in mind, Mafia 2 is 6 years older than this game. Enjoy:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixlszwKVVP0    That says it all ;)
11970	Game still runs like crap, Badly optimized, waited literally a month for CUSTOMIZATION and car customization still isn't in the game, The game is buggy, ugly, released 30fps lock, BORING because you do the same side objectives OVER and OVER AND OVER again forcefully. I paid $60 for the game and the season pass. Just giving hope that It will be good because of mafia 2. 2k shouldn't have published a boring broken game and hanger 13 are on my no purchase list EVER. Most of my hours from this game are from it being on while I watched tv or left the house because It's so god awfully boring to play. Stay away from this it is a WAIT until (finished+all DLC released$20-30) used at gamestop where you say 'Hmm, I never bought this before so I may as well try it because I have trade credit' type of game. Oh god why have you done this to me? I'm poor af and I wasted $60 on this garbage. Buy on consoles for a smooth gameplay.
11971	  Not worth a buy
11972	Pros:  Music  Cons:  Extremely repetitive FPS Lazy textures Feels like a poor man's version of GTA  The game is bad, and the developers should feel bad.
11973	Oh dear, where should i start here? I hold off my review so they could release the patch unlocking the framerate and actually be able to play this since 30 fps is unplayable for me. After 11 hours in, this is what i got from it.  - Performance of the pc version is garbage, not much to be said here, not even a gtx 1080 is able to sustain steady 60fps on max settings. - It looks like sh_i_t. Low res blurry textures, graphical glitches all over the place related to lighting and shadows, insane pop-in, ugly weather effects. - The game is unstable. Many users are experiencing crashes at the moment. I was able to reduce their frequency by limiting the framerate to 60 from uncapped but it still does it at least 1 time per 2 hours of gameplay, usually at the worst moment. It can also crash during autosaving and corrupt your savefile so good luck with that (hasn't happend to me, yet). I know it's not something on my end because i have played dozens of games on my configuration without a hitch. - Buggy as hell. npc's clipping through walls, cars floating in the air, sometimes missions won't start unless i reload the checkpoint. It feels unpolished and rushed. - Repetitive missions. So far i've seen only a few types of missions, kill someone, interrogate someone, destroy something, take out the boss. There is some fun to be had here, but doing the same thing over and over and over again gets old real fast. A little more variation (like mafia 2) could do wonders. - Npc AI is straight up ret.a.rded. I won't go into details because i'd like to keep this review from being too long. Just watch this nice dude's video and have some laughs too  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZokdmzvDGA   I know i pretty much buried the game but there are some good aspects too. Interesting story presentation and characters, solid combat mechanics (nothing groundbreaking, but enough to keep you going), nice music and voice acting. Sadly, these are not enough for me to recommend Mafia 3. Even if they fix all the technical issues, which i highly doudt, it still going to be a shallow and repetitive experience.
11974	sigh....... what to say about this game. well...... i was excited to hear it was announced and I couldn't wait, since mafia 2 was fun. but i did keep in my mind thinking it's a different game company and we all know how it is when a good game goes to diffent game developers and it it bombs ' cough cough halo 4' so i had an open mind going into the game. but WOW did they â¥â¥â¥â¥ up hard. basically the game is like destiny but with a story. you do the same mission over and over again for 30 hours. at first the game was intersting but after 5 hours into the game you don't care for the story anyomre because the game gets really tedious. Now the world environment. it's a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing joke. you remember those cool moments in mafia 2, going to a resturaunt drunk off your â¥â¥â¥ holding everyone hostage while the cops trying to get you? well the dev's decided to say 'â¥â¥â¥â¥ you' to the communtity and you can't do any of that â¥â¥â¥â¥. All you can do is steal a car and beat up civilians..... thats it. and the cops WOW is that the biggest ' â¥â¥â¥â¥ you' ever. they are basically gta cops except they are more racist. If they just see you they will go after you and start shooting. and to escape you just leave a circle. It â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sucks. the dev's of this game got so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing lazy and didn't add anything to the world to make it fun. the world is just there for you to get to one place to another and no fun in the middle. what makes open world games fun is the actual map of it's self is the icing and the story is the cake. Parts of the cake is there but the icing is just â¥â¥â¥â¥. So i don't recomend this game to anyone. stay away from this game. it's not worth $60.  I forgot to mention 1 really nice thing about the game though. and that is it's badasss soundtrack. anyone that you talk to that has the game will say that the soundtrack is amazing. when you get to the main menu and hear jimmi hendrix all along the watchtower it brings some nostalgia. and then it ends when you press play sadly
11975	Great city, strong-starting story that just trails off near the end as Lincoln becomes more and more edgy. The 'Mafia' part is just a sideshow AI is absolutely the single worst AI i've seen in a game... ever. Driving is meh Every mission is the same. Shooting gallery, destroy this stuff, wire a few boxes if you want an 'advantage.'  Hangar 13 gave a good shot at it, but it turned out half-finished and a lot of features were cut that were in Mafia 2. Could've been 2K's fault, since they published the game, as in they forced Hangar 13 to release it early for budget or... whatever reason. But you never really know. Sigh... guess I'll go back to MGS V and spend two weeks working for the money I spent on this game back.
11976	Beyond the obvious issues with capped FPS, extremely low resolution textures, lack of graphical options and the whole game being 720p upscaled to whatever resolution you're running it at.. I've now come across another splendid issue (or, for me, the final nail in the coffin):  Autosaves.  I've lost over five hours of progress so far purely because they just don't work.  The game is supposed to autosave any time you start a story mission, complete a story mission, or take over a new racket. Despite me doing all of these the game hasn't saved my progress at any point, with the only exception being when I cleared the Hollows. Since then, I've been able to play the game, but instantly lose my progress anytime I die or exit the game.  I honestly can't believe something this game breaking would make it into the 'final' release. All the other issues aside, how did this one go unnoticed? You can't even manually save the game. Was there no Q/A whatsoever? Am I just very dumb and not triggering autosaves, despite making literal hours of progress? I have no idea what's the case at this point.  I would honestly refund this game if I hadn't already played more than two hours.  --  As for the gameplay:  The AI is by and large very buggy.  The world has lots of pop in from time to time which is jarring when it happens (roads randomly disappearing for a few frames, garage doors being solid colored polygons, etc -- this is on an SSD by the way so it's probably not a bottleneck on my end).  The vehicle handing is very poor, even on the 'simulator' setting.  The mechanic for storing money in your safehouse is very clunky. It actually gets replaced almost immediately with a better option, which in my opinion, makes the whole mechanic feel pointless.  The world lacks depth, as the only places you can enter are used for story missions, and you're forced to return to them a few times for some story missions. It can get kind of tiring to clear the same club two or three times. There are exceptions to this of course, such as random garages and storefronts.. which are only used to store collectibles and medkits.. or at other times.. are just completely empty.  The stealth mechanic is very weak. Moving between cover is clunky, as is whistling to get an enemy's attention, you get a throwable item that sort of replaces whistling later on that can receive upgrades but I don't find much use in it. It's very easy, even on the hardest difficulty, to just clear an entire area with a tommygun without using stealth whatsoever.  Now, despite all this, it is an enjoyable game and the story is quite nice so far. It's just nothing I'd write home about, it might improve as you unlock more abilities and upgrades but since I can't (or rather, would rather not) make it past the first zone until the autosaving issue is fixed, I wouldn't know.
11977	Deleted after 9 hours of play time.   Thanks hangar 13 for trashing my favorite game series
11978	The 30fps cap isn't the biggest problem of this game.   Let me put this first: I am a Mafia franchise fan. Always have been. I bought Mafia on it's release in English and German. I preordered Mafia II. I bought every single DLC for Mafia II and I played them all. I have more than 100 hours of playtime in Mafia II according to Steam. I preordered Mafia III and was looking forward to it and it's new setting.   However, Mafia III isn't closely as good as it's predecessors.   I won't give you a final rating of the story or setting of Mafia III. Some people didn't appreciante that they moved from an Italian Mafia background to a black gang background. I was (and still am in a way) open-minded towards it and a bit apprehensive. I haven't played much of the story yet but so far it seems alright, even though I got the feeling that I might already know where things are going.   The conversations and cutcenes are still of high quality. IMO the cutcenes are at least on a Mafia II level, maybe even better.   So that's fine. What's the problem? Primarily the game's technology. I won't even mention the 30fps problem this game has but it has bad graphics, bad controlls, bad sound and bad physics.   As long as your on foot these problems aren't that noticeable. Shooting and the cover system are similar to that of Mafia II. There are some developer decisions that I have to critizise in this regard though: Your health will regenerate really fast. You also have the option to take a medkit in order to regenerate it instantly. Enemies are very passive during shootouts. You can easily kill them from cover even on highest difficulty. The protagonist seems kinda overpowered.   This becomes even more apparent when you take a look at melee fights: When you approach an enemy from behind you can instantly kill him / knock him out. But even when you run towards him you can knock him out with one or two hits (unarmed people on the street get knockt out after one single hit). There is no advanced melee fighting system like in Mafia I or II.   Most of the technlogical problems this game has only become visible once you get in a car and drive around a bit.  Driving itself is very underwhelming to begin with. You can still select 'Simulation' driving mode in the menu but even if you do so the handling is very easy. You can drive at full throttle all the time without any problems. You can 'drift' on a straight street. The whole driving model is very basic, unrealstic and easy. I don't think I can find any open world game with a comparable driving model in the last ~10 years.   You will also notice several other problems while driving through the streets:   -Mafia III's world might be bigger than that of Mafia II or Mafia I but it feels empty and lacks details.  -The car's motor sounds are bad. They don't change when you accelerate or make a burnout. The Thunderbird has the sound of a sewing machine.  -When you hit another other car with high speed it will barely slow you down but fly through the air like it was hit by a NASA rocket  -All static objects other than traffic signs are undestroyable and will stop you instantly if you crash into them though. Even some(!) phone booths.  -When you drive into a pedestrian they will be stand in front of your car while beeing pushed around. They will drop dead as soon as you stop. I have seen better solutions in open world games of the pre-GTAIV-era!  -Volumetric smoke? Nope!  -All in all bad effects -Aggressivee LOD -Bad textures -Low draw distance -Fog -In the first daylight missions the weather will change within seconds from super light sunny with massive bloom effects to dark clouded and back. Quite annoying.  -All in all very bad lighting in the first daylight missions (bug?).  -Ugly, low detailed car models! Really. There are cars that look like they are out of the 50's. Some have a strong resemblance with cars that where in Mafia II. But they didn't take the models from Mafia II. They created new, similar looking models that look worse on closer inspectation. Makes me wonder why. Did they just buy the name and not the rights to use previous content?  -The damage models of the cars are worse than in Mafia II -Sometimes shadows are casted to different directions  There are also bugs where certain items fly in the air because furniture isn't displayed or instances where the player falls through the floor of the map.    Conclusion
11979	Waste..of...Money.. Nothing in the game convinced me. Mafia 2 is way..way better in every aspect..every
11980	As of now, I have no other choice but to leave a negative review of this game and advise not to buy it until proper PC support is implemented. I've played 55min and the game seems that it can be a good game, I like the atmosphere and the style but the lack of better PC support is not acceptable in 2016.   The 30fps cap has no place in PC gaming and worst of all the developer hide this info until the very end! I cannot accept this kind of behavior towards gamers! Too many times this developers use the 'day one' patch to fix a game after release, well, the game should be fixed before release and if it is not, then, either delay or in the very least let the consumer know what is going on! But not fixing it and not divulging this info is not acceptable!  Also, 21:9 is not properly supported. It has lots of glitches in menus (words and graphics get cutted)  I won't play anymore until the patch and after trying that I'll either change my review to a positive one or just get a refund for a game that was not made to work on PCs.  For now I cannot recomend this game!
11981	TL/DR: save yourself some time and money if you're new to the mafia franchise and buy mafia 2.  *UPDATED* for those interested review follows:  â¥â¥â¥â¥ textures (muddy,grainy, blurry with some SERIOUSLY low res roads walls and general environment) that look like they were ripped straight out of Prototype (a game from 2008 WTF 2K?),   story is basically shadow of mordor set in new orleans (Same premise same gameplay BUT NOW WITH GUNS AND CARS! Boss mechanics and story points are basically ripped sraight from Shadow of Mordor along with the whole story being near identical... but being set in 1960's america) standard revenge storyline low stress,   I've noticed a whole lot of people commenting on the story of the game and how 'brave' the developers were to take on a troubled era in American history (rampant racism being the main trouble) and while I might not have been alive in the 1960's (I'm 20) i do feel compelled to comment on the use of racism in this game: It appears that the use of racism is purely there as fluff to distract from the fact that the character interaction is really non-existent and very poorly written (probably in an attempt to make you feel something that the character fail to evoke) with completely forgettable characters being thrust forward and never actually developed or fleshed out. You can read more about them in the in game bio screens but from a pure storytelling perspective they are basically flat hollow mission givers with no real reason to care about them or Lincoln's straight Shadow of Mordor campaign or even Lincoln himself! I personally couldn't tell you a damn thing about any of the characters I met during my 5/6 hours with the game and that's a real shame.  rinse and repeat missions (There's so â¥â¥â¥â¥ING MANY of these they got boring and repetitive extremely quickly), often recycling the same layouts and environments for different 'missions' even enemy placements have very little variation,  crap controls (mouse acceleration with no off switch? c'mon guys that's just lazy/no working key rebind system? â¥â¥â¥â¥ sake),   *FIXED* 30FPS lock out of the box (I know its been said like a million times but it matters),   HOWEVER this now presents the issue pertaining to maintaining a consistent 60fps this game running on my system on high reaches 40fps with the fps locked to 60 NOW i would like to take the time to outline the system that this game is running on:  Intel Core i7 5960X @ 4.5 Ghz 16 GB of Corsair Dominator Platinum at 2400 Mhz 2 EVGA GTX 980 ti's 6GB in SLI (the system req's call for a single 290X or 780 from 2013...) Samsung 850 Evo Pro 1TB All sitting on a ASUS Rampage V Extreme All custom watercooled  this system should eat this game up and spit it the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out 3 times over ESPECIALLY as it runs Witcher 3 on ultra at a solid 60FPS without breaking a sweat, this brings the issue up of just poor optimisation for the PC platform and explains why they didn't put full 60 on from the start. PC was an afterthought, a cliff note, a 'oh â¥â¥â¥â¥ we forgot do that' moment and thats not right we bought the game same as everyone else treat us with at least a little â¥â¥â¥â¥ing respect you did willfully take our money.   no SLI support,   menu's are a joke, blurry aliased text (if you play at a res higher than 1080p) CLEARLY designed for controllers not a mouse and keyboard (as in it has no mouse input at all apart from in maybe the new game section but still displays the cursor),  if you want to play in 21:9 good luck dealing with all the artifacting that comes with it (lighting bugs, discolouration, interface designs e.g the low health blood that appears only covers a 16:9 space...) including a rave party at the edges of the screen whenever you go indoors (spoiler alert you might have to do that quite a bit),   texture pop in is a MAJOR issue with this game along with a HIDEOUS draw distance that means things get properly rendered when they're 10 ft away (by rendered i of course mean that the textures just pop into existence extremely noticeably)   enemies take 1/2 to a full mag to kill if not shot in the head and even then its not a sure thing (the â¥â¥â¥â¥ am I fighting luke cage? I was playing the game on medium btw mother â¥â¥â¥â¥ers take 7 shots in the chest and keep walking)  the police system that was in mafia 2 has been stripped down to cops shoot on sight if you run a red light (what happened to the fine/arrest/shoot/wanted system?)  cover system works well if not a little temperamental on occasion  shooting felt fine but i found myself constantly running out of ammo due to the aforementioned Luke Cage esque enemies  sneak felt like beating up on quadriplegic kids because the AI is legit totally incapable of seeing you crouched in front of them  driving is either PEDAL TO THE METAL or FULL STOP there is no in between and you'll spend most of your time wrestling for control of the car (the game then has the cheek to offer you 'simulation driving' to make is harder... what were they thinking...)  the standard formula of go here kill this was a common theme... wait ... the only theme that ran though this game and the story only gave context (sometimes it's really paper thin) as to why you are doing what your doing  the game also has these kind-of not cutscenes but cutscenes where you and the person you're meeting with stand awkwardly and wooden with dialogue playing overtop it (this happens WAY more than it should) normally preceeding you going to a place and shooting the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of it like 90% of the other missions that Clay will be undertaking  lastly the options menu is a disaster the graphics settings seem to do nothing to the look of the game having swapped from high to low and low to high the only real difference I could see was the ambient occlusion was missing on the low preset but texture difference is basically non existant (Im starting to think that low and high are the same thing in the config file)  huge disappointment was a game that i was really looking forward to... :(  UPDATE: Steam won't refund me my money so i guess it's only fair that IF (&lt; big if) any of this â¥â¥â¥â¥ gets fixed i will update this review accordingly
11982	I can't recomment this game, okay the cut scenes look great, but that's all.... I'm playing this on Hard and I'm just walking through this, little to no challenge, this is a bad port for the PC glitches and graphics wise disapointed, won't recomment it.
11983	So yeah, it took me 39 hours to play through this game. That's not bad for a modern game, though of course I did take my sweet time and did all the side missions as well, and gathered all collectibles (still can't find that last album cover, it does not appear on the map).  Anyway, I honestly don't know whether I can recommend this title or not. I'll list the pros and cons, first things first.  Pros:  -Vito! -Great cutscenes! -No fast travel! -Music! -Gunfights (stealthmode is also very intuitive!) -The city is huge! -Well designed cars (they don't use any real life cars, but rather make some up by mixing existing ones - they really did a great job on that) - the driving is alright as well, although I feel that it should've been a greater challenge, especially since I was in simulation mode! -Upgrades for cars, your character, and item slots. Gives a nice sense of development as you progress through the story!  Cons:  -Handholding. Arrows pointing to your current objectives at all times, for example - it's just not necessary. You're also just a quick phonecall away to have a car delivered, weapons to purchase, and money to store. You can also disable phones with this 'feature', and eventually be able to call off the cops, even... I mean.... eh. It's just way too easy to succeed in this game. Handholding is bad. -Poor graphics, badly optimized. They look very blurry compared to other games, and there's no visual difference between high and low? Ok then. The framerate also suffered at times, though not too bad, at least for me. -Rackets. These are incredibly boring and repetitive - and you get to do them about 500 billion times. -Forced to unlock story missions. This is the worst move by far. -Very little depth to the majority of the characters. Example: You are forced to take over rackets and districts and whatnot to unlock more dialogue with some characters, and eventually you unlock this super dramatic dialogue and find yourself not giving two â¥â¥â¥â¥s because... well why would you? There's little to no story behind the characters, and you just can't sympathize. Basically the majority of the characters are just shallow. Not that great for a supposedly 'story rich' game.  I think that's everything, so now you see why I do not know whether to recommend this game or not. Hmm... signs point to no. The way the game is now... I just can't recommend it. Maybe if they release a patch to optimize it better - that way the pros will outbalance the cons.  This is just my personal opinion - if you like doing repetitive stuff for hours on end to see how the main story unfolds, then by all means go for it. I don't think it's worth the price that Steam is listing it for though.
11984	Just get Mafia 2 or 1, instead of this garbage.
11985	Too repetitive to recommend, 14 hours in and the story's barely moved, and I just got a whole ton MORE busywork to advance the story. They watered down a couple aspects that I liked from Mafia 2. I've been tearing around town, speeding past cops, and no one has noticed. Doesn't look like they care at all about speeding violations anymore. Also I don't think there's a fuel gauge anymore either, not a big deal, but I kinda liked that in Mafia 2, even tho I hardly ever had to fuel up.  The missions I've played so far are alright, but it's just the same thing over and over, oftentimes in the same locations as you've done almost the exact same mission within the past hour. The driving feels ok. Not exceptional, but I'm kind of a stickler for driving physics and I don't hate it, they feel a little stiff but still on the fun side of serviceable. Story's compelling so far.  This game ran like hot garbage at first, couldn't even maintain 30fps without stutters. Seems like it was CPU limited, maxxing my CPU repeatedly. Then I turned on Hyperthreading in my Bios, and it cleared all the stutters right up. Activity monitor shows none of the cores (real or virtual) getting maxxed out, and the load is spread quite evenly across them. This is the first application I've ever seen hyperthreading make ANY difference on, and the difference was night and day. Bizarre.  Now I can maintain 60fps/1080p with mostly medium settings, reflections and AA set to low. If I turn reflections up to medium, it's a playable 40-60fps, usually 50-60. i7 3770k, gtx980, 16gb ddr3, ssd. Not terribly impressive, given I can run GTA V with most settings maxxed, but better than playing the slideshow I was seeing for the first hour of gameplay.
11986	**I'll update after more play time.**  This is a painful review because the cut scenes and story in this game is very very good. The game made me almost instantly care about the characters of the game. I wanted to see Lincoln Clay through the end and I'll still give it a shot. Facial expressions during cut scenes and voice acting is awesome and after about 30 minutes of it in the intro, you're very excited to get out into the open world and tear up the city and see what else the game has to offer. After you leave the first area though and into the second part of town you start to see the games limitations, and it's painfully obvious.  I'm going to put aside the games CURRENT 30fps lock and lack of SLI support (as someone running 2 GTX 1080's it's really frustrating to see a AAA game locked at 30 and no SLI support), even though it screams 'I'm another shoddy PC port.' Even though this also happened during my gameplay:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkfmFV_2Lhc  So with the potential PC conflicts aside lets juts look at two massive issues I see with the game itself.  Graphics: Very muddy textures. If you spotted Angry Joe's rant where he used the sky as an example and litterally compared the sky in this game to the sky in Zelda: Ocarina of Time on the Nintendo 64. It's pretty sad to see how lazy development got here. Some of the tree's and vegitation does look decent though, as a plus. However it's hard to miss the poor textures when walking around the city, even when playing it on resolutions beyond 1080p  Missions and game design: Yesterday I tracked down a collectable Playboy in an area. It was inside warehouse on the second floor. There where some stairs leading on the outside going straight to it. A few hours later I found myself in a totally different area of the game. I noticed another collectable playboy on the map and I went to collect it. When I got there I got hit with deja vu as I quickly noticed that this warehouse was EXACTLY the same warehouse as the first. Quite literally as even the funature, boxes, desks, machines, random garbage strewn about the place and even the god damn playboy was even in the EXACT same spot. You'll find a lot of places that are like this in the game.  As far as missions go, you will find yourself repeating the same missions over and over again as you take over rackets in the city. Which will get exceptionally tedious over time. If you are trying to collect everything, it will make the game really hard to complete as you will find that you are forcing yourself to get through the last half.   Based off my initial impressions so far. It's hard to reccomend this right now. Who knows what DLC will bring to it and how it will change. Also still waiting on this patch that will unlock the frame rate, However in it's current form as of THIS date this game is a hard reccomendation. If you loved Mafia 2 and really want to see how the story continues, you'll probably enjoy the story. If you're someone just looking for a good game, than hold off a little bit and see how 2k handles the post launch aftermath.  **Edit** So the patch to unlock the frames is out SLI still isn't supported, but I expected far better than 60fps with a EVGA SC 1080 at 1440p. Inside I was getting between 60-70 fps. The second I hit the road and started driving I had dips into the high 40's. Unless you're playing at 4k, a dip into 40fps with a card like that is unacceptable. The game needs to be optimized more.
11987	Bullsh*t if compared to the last game (Mafia II).
11988	Dont buy this raw console port !!! : - Remap key bindings and surprise USE function not working cant even 'grab those keys' at the begining of game (fixed) - 30 FPS lock in 2016 on PC (fixed) - Low res textures - Idiotic key binding (remaping keys not working) (fixed) UPD - after playing about an hour crash (no log) UPD 1 (after pach) - 4 crashes in about 15 minutes - lightnig is gliching UPD 2 - liberal marxist propoganda. Disrispect of Dixie flag and southern ground.
11989	Updated: This is not an acceptable game for 2016. The amount of glitches, repetitiveness, and lack of other missions, and jobs to do after you complete the story is poor. Mafia 3 tried hard to bring back the Mafia series, but it crashed and burned. I had so much hope for this game, but it turned out to be another No Man's Sky of 2016.  Original Post Below: This great video by CrowbCat shows the many things wrong with Mafia III PC version.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZokdmzvDGA   This is what happens when you give a good game series to a different developer who has no idea on how to make proper video games. I had so high hopes for this game, but I was let down once again by the gaming industry.  This game is so awful. When I decided to play on PC, it was because I have a choice. I could choose my hardware, my software, my resolution, my framerate, and my graphics, but what Hangar 13 did is unacceptable. They locked the game to 30FPS, and their reason for that is: 'The team has been hard at work ensuring that Mafia IIIâs performance is consistent across all platforms, and right now the game runs at a solid 30 frames-per-second.'   That's the most â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t I have ever heard in one sentence. Mafia III for PC is a console port. The game has so many problems when it comes to reflections, lighting, and no SLI support. The antialiasing just blurs the game to make the edges look better, the PC controls are horrendous, and the game is being upscaled from 720p. It's so damn hard to focus on the story aspect when the screen is tearing, the graphics are glitching out, things pop in at ridiculous distance, but wait, they are releasing a patch to make the game run over 60FPS, and fix the issues. Too late, you already screwed up the game's launch, and what you have done will not be forgotten. They did release the patch to unlock the framerate, but since they never optimized the game good, it still runs like â¥â¥â¥â¥. This was my birthday present, and it's the worst â¥â¥â¥â¥ing birthday present I have ever gotten. Hangar 13 didn't deliver on their promise on putting time, and effort into their PC version. You had 5 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing years to sort all this â¥â¥â¥â¥ out, but you didn't. Nice job Hangar 13, you made a sequel to Mafia II worse.  Don't buy this game.
11990	I've played through the game twice, A majority of my playing time is offline thus my hours aren't reflecting actual time in-game.  Good game but still feels as though we're being guided along the rails. This feels like a step back from Mafia 2. No clothes shops, no car workshops, no gas stations. Graphics were pretty blah out of the box, but after the patch that unlocked FPS and a ReShade preset, the game looks pretty good on a 1070 GTX. It ran consistently, based on the Steam overlay, at 56-57 FPS.  Pros:  -Little details - reactions to PC, witnesses calling in crimes, etc. The city feels alive.  -Environmental/Weather system (people use umbrellas when it's raining, streets get wet when it rains, and they gradually dry after rains)  -Story is very good  -Voice acting is exceptional  Cons:  -Weather system - sometimes it rained for days at a time, and weather changed far too abruptly at times.   -Side missions to increase racket income are repetitive and tedious. This is where a lot of time in the game will be spent as objectives are clear on the other side of the map from you.  -Enemy and Police AI needs some serious attention. Enemies were completely inept unless it was a scripted event. As far as police: No speeding tickets, I could ram into cars all day in front of police but if I accidentally bumped a civilian a 5 state all points bulletin happened.   -Motorist AI is horrendous. I experienced huge traffic jams in some areas of the city which made some missions impossible to complete.  -Buggy: Had dual Cassandras and Burkes when I did the last of their personal missions, boats spawing on land, cars I needed to steal blowing up for no apparent reason before I could get to them. Disappearing icons - being told to go talk to so and so (while doing racket earning missions) and not being able to as the icons didn't appear on the map. My 'GPS' path displayed would bug out occasionally turning into some super wide path that was impossible to follow, and many more.  -Unless you're a completionist, there's zero replay value. As stated above, racket earnings missions are extremely tedious and that alone is reason for me not to want to touch this game again.  -Locations get reused. 'Hey kill a pimp here..' 30 minutes later, hey the boss is so dumb he went back to the same location the pimp was at. Kill him there.' With so many locations possible, this is just pure laziness.  -Different endings but really doesn't feel like it means much as the endings are the end. What happened to 'open world games' letting the player continue playing after the main story is finished? This game could be so much more..  -DLC: First DLC, through free, offered outfits that should have shipped with the game.  tl;dr Good game if you're a 'one and done' player. If you're looking for replay value I'd wait and see what future patches and/or DLC offer. As of now I can't recommend the game. It's buggy, should have never shipped with a 30 fps lock for PC players, and feels more hollow than it's predecessor.   *review edited to reflect release of first DLC*
11991	Even forgiving the terrible ai this game is a technical mess. 30 fps lock it's only the beginning of this game issues, there's a constant 'fog' that really kills your view distance, everything is upscaled, no real native 1080p or higher, there are glitches everywhere, shadows popping in and out, and sunlight appearing and disappearing. Definetly WAIT for this game to be fixed before buying it
11992	Review after 9 hours. I do not plan to continue. And the review mostly focuses on the negatives.   Mafia III had a rough start with the 30FPS lock which can make alot of people get negative feelings toward a game and see bad because they're looking for it. But I really like to keep an open and positive mind on a game unless it forces me to stop, Mafia III did that. The story and setting in this game can be a reason to play it, from what I've seen the story is quite good with interesting characters, but the story won't save a game because its a game and not a movie. The setting is of course what makes a Mafia game and its nice to see a 1960's world with all of its amazing music. Too bad that the game was advertised as having this amazing New Bordeaux city but for me, it kinda feel's boring and unmemorable.   That brings me nicely into the open wold gameplay... unless after 9 hours I havent unlocked the 'real game', its terrible. You can not get a haircut, can't at least change clothes, you can't even customize cars or even store them, there are set few cars you can call after you've unlocked them by progressing through the story. All the open world does is let's you pick which order you want do complete your objectives. Mafia II literally had more 'open world stuff' than Mafia III. Mafia II suffered from not being open world, Mafia III I don't think would suffer if it was linear. Mafia III could have been something interesting, it has such a potential for a GTA-like, open world game but set in 60's, but it feels very much like just another 'generic open world game' with no soul. Gameplay and world feel stiff and with terrible physics and with repetetive open world tasks you need to do. I'd love to have a world I feel like I live in like Mafia II, not the generic open world game world with nothing to do in.   What else we got... gunplay is quite nice, driving is much more arcadey than mafia 2 and I'm personally not into that, I liked the realism of slower and heavier old cars. Stealth is fine... quite a nice addition where you can chose if you want to stab everyone or go guns blazing, both work and are pretty much equally as fun so when stealth goes wrong, shooting is still an option. And stealth would be great if not for the absoluteley awful AI that will not see you when you stand in front of them (trying to play into racism that black people are harder to spot in the dark or what?), or when you LITERALLY STAB SOMEONE IN FRONT OF THEM,  https://youtu.be/hquqaGIR5SU   Aside from the 30fps lock, the graphics look fine... as long as its not daylight  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=778470153  The reflections in this game are garbage and day lightning makes me ill, shaders break sometimes. Really, games that are pre-alpha can look better than Mafia III and thats complete â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. I paid for a AAA game and not early acess. In other situations its quite alright, the facial animations for an example are really nice.   Then theres other stuff, the glitches that you can find everywhere,   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZokdmzvDGA  The extreme lack of polish this game is really pushies it over the line into hate territory for me. While playing you constantly run into a new bug every few minutes and it gets really distracting, like someone poking you once being alright but poking you once every minute would make you go crazy. I could have have rated it 'ok', as buy for a lower price when it comes and play this game that doens't really feel like Mafia II but a kind of generic open world game. But all this lack of polish and abundance of glitches, bugs and all other annoyances push me to say. Don't get it.  Its my opinion, I'd play it if it was some sub at least 20euro game after all of the glitches are fixed. Right now I only wish I could refund...
11993	Alright. So i have decided to not play this game past 2 hours just in case this fps fix ever gets released. And if it does, i want to have 1 hour left to test it. So here is my thoughts on the game after playing the first 2 missions, and i took the time to get out of my car and look at some textures, some animations, and stuff like that. Just to get a quick first impression of what this game is.  I run GTX 1080 rig with the lastest nVidia drivers, basically a PC that runs games like GTA V &amp; The Division all maxed out in over 60fps.  The first thing i notice is that this game can not run in window borderless, it's either windowed or fullscreen, which is the second hint that this company had no plans of making a good pc version of this game, the first hint was the fps cap. Neither 2k or Hangar13 said anything about a fps cap, until the game was released, when pc gamer wrote an article on it. Then the popular youtuber totalbiscuit started asking questions, and that's when 2k made a statement.  This statement does not specify anything other than that they know the game is running in 30 fps and that higher fps will come soon.  They do not say how many fps or what soon means . But it is likely they are trying to keep people playing and hoping, so that they pass their 2 hour steam refund mark.  It makes absolutely no sense to release a game in this state if they knew how to avoid it. No sense at all. So i will take all they say with a few hundred grains of salt.  Releasing a game to reviewers, the very people that are there to critizise your product, in a state that, in their words, will be fixed 'very soon'. Yeah right.. Very logical.   One thing that does make sense however is why this game had a review embargo.  TBH this game seems unfinished. The graphics looks like they are at least 5 years old. The city and the scale looks really good, but it looks like the entire game is upscaled.  This is a game that is not worth the price they are currently asking , not even close. I will put a hold on my refund atm, and see if a fix will arrive, but for those of you who are on the fence about buying this game, i would wait. It is a bad pc port, almost without any work gone into it.  In short:   +Narrative and story seems good +Absolutely incredible soundtrack  -Can't bind extra mouse buttons to anything -Rear view mirror has terrible draw distance -30 fps cap -Really low res textures all over the place -Looks like upscaled graphics -Horrible shadow draw distance on some objects   This is what i can remember at the top of my head. This is not worthy of a triple A PC release. Even if the game was running at 60fps, this does not look like a PC game with this price tag. So wait until it's on at least 50% sale.  It saddens me a bit to say this, because i had hopes for this game, i added it to my wishlist last December. And was looking forward to enjoying this game for the next few weeks until civilization VI releases. If it wasn't for the steam refund system, i would have felt robbed right now.  TBH this game has issues i don't think they will fix anytime soon, there will be plenty of fanboys saying i'm wrong about this, that a fix is just around the corner. But i can't see it happening. Maybe a 60fps fix is coming within the next week or so, maybe 2 weeks. But that will still make the game look washed out.  This review might change completely if they do something drastic.    EDIT:   Thanks to user :  Butcher of Blaviken , i'm now adding some information to this review. After i wrote this review, 2K released another statement which reads:   We currently have a patch running here at the studio that includes 30, 60, and unlimited frames-per-second options in the video menu, among other improvements for the PC version of Mafia III. We re verifying the patch now to ensure everything is working as expected. If everything goes well, we expect the update to go live this weekend.     EDIT 2:   This game is much worse than i thought. I have seen a lot of videos today showing hundreds of serious bugs and glitches. From the looks of it, this game is far worse than watch_dogs was/is.  So now i have absolutely no hope left that this game will ever be fixed, if you want to see, just search for 'Let's Break the Mafia 3 AI' &amp; 'mafia 3 gameplay bugs', and stuff like that on google and youtube and a lot of videos will show you how bad this game really is.  So i just refunded it. This is totally unacceptable, and 2K should have known better. And i usually defend 2K as they release a lot of quality content. But this is the first title made by Hangar13, and i can safely say they were not up for the task.
11994	So, I went into this game more hype than I was for GTA V, since Mafia 2 is a masterpiece in my opinion, a genuinely timelesss looking game with a pretty incredible story and a beautiful setting. This game genuinely turned me off of Mafia. I don't give a hoot about the 30fps lock, it's still sufficiently smooth, but..  Here's some of the things I find annoying, from a Mafia 2 perspective.  -The game plays like a movie. Half of my playtime thus far has been cutscenes. Decent story, but holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ I didn't expect to learn every minute detail of what Clay had for breakfast. Were the eggs runny? Was the sausage overdone? Coming up next in our next exciting episode. -The AI is in fact, bad. In the initial shootout, a guard ran back and forth in front of me, saying 'This is a massacre.' on a 2 second loop. It'd be funny if it didn't happen every room. -The cars are actually pretty fantastic, but there's no option to stealth steal a car. That gets old. -Cops don't like you. You exist. You are now wanted. -AI traffic drives around with hoods, trunks, and random doors open. That's jarring as all get-out. -I get a weird bug where glass just floats in the street randomly. Why? Iunno. -This game plays like a bad GTA IV mod. Picture in Picture on the rear view mirror has no AA. People in cars have no animations. The rear view mirror looks like playing Driver 2 on the original Playstation. -The 'Peds call the cops' mechanic is more broken than it's worth. You can literally just waltz up and one hit them. They rarely seek out a payphone. -The cutscenes look WAY better than the actual game does.  For having held Mafia 2 in such insane regard, y'all really dropped the dang ball on this one. Fix yourselves.  More playtime edit:  I thought this game -might- get a little better after a few hours, but spoilers, it didn't.  Here's some more irritating stuff that I learned about the game:  -The whole game feels cut and paste. The mission structure is the same throughout the whole game. Go into this district. Kill these idiots. Destroy this stuff. Kill this racket leader. Rinse and repeat twice. Kill the district leader. Give it to a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥y underboss. What variety? Even on missions that were showcased at E3 and other trade shows had their balls cut off. The main mission showcased, with the underground firefight that showcased getting intelligence and planning your approach ISN'T IN THE MAIN GAME.  -The cutscenes and the story It actually did lessen up, there's a lot more free play time after the first few hours, but this game is still crap. There's little story to speak of.  -The customization What customization? It's supposedly finally coming as 'free DLC' but I doubt it, real bad.   -The cars They all do roughly the same speed, rapid acceleration to 35mph, shift, okay accel to 50, shift, meh accel to 70, shift, hit whatever that car's limit is. Why? However, they did keep the moving windshield wipers from Mafia 2, which is neat, and even has the radio go static when you enter a carpark or go into a tunnel, which is a rad little detail.  -The AI THIS IS A MASSACRE  -The FPS patch This â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ me off, really bad. When it came out, it redid the complete control scheme without explaining the changes or -why the control scheme needed to be changed-. Why? Cuz. These developers SUCK.
11995	Since i played this game a whole lot, i changed my opinion on the game.  As before: the one interesting thing is the revenge story, which features racism and has a cool django unchained like flair to it (black folk facing racism and stuff).  But damn the gameplay is tedious and repetitive. I forced myself playing this game for so long, hoping things would vary a little bit along the line. But i was soooo wrong.  You basicly do the same thing over and over: 1. Drive to contact 2. learn about a person 3.Kill or interrogate a dude, destroy crates 4. Lure the mentioned person out 5. Kill that person  Thats all you do as long as you play the game. There is no fast travel or anything and you have to drive around from point to point which can take a bit depending where you go....probably to lengthen the game.  The only fun i had was when i went nuts....drove to a point, killed the contact with a single headshot...and quickly escaped. The police isnt chasing you anyway even if you speed right past them.  Unlike in Mafia 2, you cant change clothes or lincence plates to become incognito, you cant change clothes at all. When you are seen commiting a crime, you punch or shoot the witness running to the telephone and thats it...nothing happened...if someone sees you shooting the witness, just kill the new one and drive away without a care in the world.  I Really REALLY wanted this game to be good....i thought the southern revenge story full of racism and stuff was more interesting then gta, more bound in reality...but this game is not worth it.  I recommend playing mafia 2 or GTAV; GTA V is the open world action king and will remain so because it has enough variety to keep you entertaint till the end.  Mafia 3 is entertaining the first 2 hours till you find out the stuff you did till then is all you will do for the rest of the game.  Dont buy this game, wait for a cheap sale if you are interested, but dont pay the price it is currently charged for.
11996	***Please note this is purely my opinion, you are free to disagree with me but keep it civil. Abusive comments and personal attacks will be deleted.***  Pros:  + Excellent cutscenes + Excellent story + Good music selection + Weapons sound realistic and meaty + Setting the driving to simulation feels really good  Cons:  - Repetitive missions (Go here, kill/destroy something, come back, repeat!) - Poorly optimized - Muddy, grainy textures (Looks like upscaled 720p textures) - Clunky mouse and keyboard controls - Can't rebind keys to extra mouse buttons - Can't jump! - When using the mouse to look around while driving it constantly resets itself to the default position - Moving around cover isn't as smooth and easy when compared to other cover based shooters - Multiple crashes to desktop  Verdict:  An excellent story hampered by some performance issues along with questionable and annoying design decisions.  If you are willing and able to overlook the many small issues then I urge you to at least try it for yourself because the game is definitely not terrible but for me personally I wouldn't recommend it... Not at full price anyway.  I would hold off buying it for for now. Wait for a sale as there are too many annoying issues bringing down what could potentially be a really great game.  If I had to give it a rating I'd score it a 6.5 out of 10 (slightly above average)   ***UPDATE*** A patch has been announced which should come out on the weekend. So long as it corrects many of the minor issues you can expect this review to change... Fingers crossed.  ***UPDATE 2*** After spending a little more time with the game (went over 2 hours... woops!) I have edited some of the pros and cons and adjusted my score upwards slightly, If the coming patch adresses things like frame rate, textures and keybinds I will adjust it higher again and possibly reccomend the game.  ***UPDATE 3*** A patch has been released that corrects the 30 fps lock and the game feels a lot smoother and responsive, however all other issues listed still remain along with some weird graphical bugs like objects disappearing and what feels like more frequent crashes which weren't present before... I have updated both my review and score a second time and this will likely be my final verdict and update.
11997	Broken out of the box, Quality control dropped the ball on this one.  You might have heard about the fps and graphics gripe (not to miss in most reviews) but what baffles me  is that the keymapping seems to break the game, leaving you stuck in a mission where the game tells you to press (key) and or (keypad) controller and nothing happens..   Tried out to reset all keysettings, and got it working: make sure you have no double keybinds and or conflicts. so if you use arrow keys walking dont use them for driving, this seems to mess things up  assigning keysettings to a mouse doesnt seem to work unless you can program mouse to emulate keyboard keys.  music and story are quite entertaining, even the shooting has a nice feel and look to it. couple this with nice driving but lackluster graphics its still a mixed bag, although the story is very compelling and well written.  After several hours in, i can say the story is still very compelling, i got drawn to the characters and just can't wait how it develops and see how my actions influence the game, the voice acting is superb, even the smallest details when you hear some people talk to eachother when sneaking around have me stop and listen, same as with the radio sometimes you just have to drive around to hear it.  Now the only thing that is getting to me is how long it takes to get to a cutscene to progress the story, the repetive nature and major flaw of this game seems to creep in, find object bug phone, find person, kill person and or interogate person, sneak or shoot (my favorites).  Although each in different settings but if the settings are the only thing to endure the time consuming repetive task of progress then i don't know i want to continue and even finish the game.  I realise all games have something repetive yet when it becomes to obvious it wears down my enthusiasm and i get bored, putting the game down and shelfing it.  It's better than mad max game but way behind the last grand theft auto or batman arkham asylum in the gameplay department, which just seem to have a bit more diversity in the long run to make you want to finish the game.  btw, i never in the 20 hours managed to take one of those brutal finishers, playing with mouse and keyboard, never saw the option pop up or just shoot them in the head as enemies can take quite a few shots before going down, a bit to much imho when you got authentic storytelling.   but i'm shelfing it for now, repetive threshold has been reached... very dissapointing for such a game
11998	Please just check this comparison of Mafia 3 vs Mafia 2 from 2010:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixlszwKVVP0   Story is the strongest point of this game. Just love brutality and language. But missions are repetitive with a lot of long, boring driving in between. Fast travel would be welcome here. Also AI is very stupid to the point when enemies are looking at the walls for 30 seconds from 20 cm distance. Is this Blair Witch Project ??? Graphics mostly are ok but also nothing like we seen in trailers or devs gameplays. The sky, water and grass are the weakest points. Also there is some serious issue whith water and cars slightly glowing at night. Combat is good but also very 'bare bons'. The only 'special' thing about it is you die fast if you do not try to be stealth or use covers. Cover system is good but sometimes clunky and hard to 'manage'. Driving is different and games like GTA, Driver or even FarCry done it better. I didn't encounter any crashes. There are FPS drops, some textures has low resolution and light/shadow glitches.Game was locked on 30 FPS without informing players before release day. This is unacceptable on PC and just outrageous. Overall game works - I7 4770K and GTX 980ti. But there are many people with crashes and games not running at all. There is nothing special about this game that makes you want to play all day long.
11999	I never thought that someday I will be so disapointed in Mafia game. ..will watch all the cutscenes on youtube, cause it's a waste of time to play it through. Degraded in every way possible from previous Mafia titles. It's even waste of time to write this opinion, cause none of us still plays it or considers to buy.
12000	Pro's:  - uuuhhh.. - Lincoln himself looks well animated - Facial expressions - Music - Some night, rain+lighting settings  Con's:  - Bought it as pre-order (thanks to this game, I'll think twice before buying pre-order stuff again) - Bought it with Season Pass (fml) - The graphics look average (like other ppl said, copy pasted console port) - DESIGNING MISTAKE IN 100% OF THE CARS! SRSLY, WHERE ARE THE TANK NOZZLES? As there are gas stations, those cars have to be fueled with something.. It ain't air for sure.. - Repetitive gameplay (like really repetitive.. Assassins Cree* Style) - 'Open World' is heavily restricted (can't plow through bushes, MANY buildings have only 1 or 2 entrances/exits, main gates to facilities aren't accessible by foot, but when you ram a car through, you got yourself a new entrance) - Lifeless surrounding AI - Stupid AI in general (1.) it's more fun to rush through your missions with a knife, the AI won't notice you anyway :D 2.) in bars for example, in which only white ppl are allowed, just sneak to the barman, knock him out and steal his money.. The guests are A: not even slightly interested in the fact that a black man knocked out the barman or B: just stand up, scream and try calling the police)   I really feel sorry for all the guys and girls who pre-ordered this half baked console port, as there are just so many things wrong with this game, I think they won't be able to fix. Still, I payed much money, so I will complete the game + DLC at some point, but I regret it in any way.  If I would be a developer, I wouldn't be happy with this product I made..  Can't recommend, sadly
12001	At the time of writing this review, I simply cannot recommend the game.  Terrible technical issues, a framerate stuck hovering between 30 and 40, disappearing textures, physics bugs, and more. The story isn't worth sticking with the nonsense that is this game's technical failure on almost every level.
12002	+ Neat cutscenes + Soundtrack + Shooting mechanics are okay, but the ridiculous easiness of 'whistle + silent takedowns' almost makes that a non-issue  - Graphics: pathetic draw distance, night-time missions, low-res textures, everything is very much 2012 - Physics, or rather lack of it - Car damage: generic, lacking any kind of appeal. Expecting Mafia I level of destruction? Nope, think NFS. - Driving feels very off, cars are basically undistiguishable from each other - Big sandbox; very dull world. Copy-pasted building interiors are supposed to add to the experience, but grow old very fast. NPC's are obsessed with racial issues. I'd venture to say that the universally lambasted Watch_Dogs fared far better in regards of creating a living breathing game world: not because it was so good, it was that much better. Yes, they actually butchered the late 60's America to death. This is not GTA: London 1969 3D. Euro Truck Driver's world got heaps more personality than this trainwreck. - Grotesquely Evil White People.  A technologically backwards and soulless take on a once-great franchise. GTA V has been out for 3 years, and this doesn't come close in any regard whatsoever. Not necessarily 'refund level' disappointing, but very disappointing nonetheless.  The 'in-your-face', obnoxious pre-game disclaimer, doesn't add to the experience either, to say the very least. I don't like my mediocre $60 games coming with the head writer, Haden Blackman's, take on racial issues, or rather any politicking whatsoever.  There's Twitter and there are supposedly AAA games. No need to intertwine the two.  Especially so when the end-result is basically a slightly polished turd.
12003	30 FPS cap aside the graphics in general are awful, view distance is terrible (cars pop up so close you canât avoid hitting them if you are driving fast), the city in the distance looks blurry, textures are awful and look obviously up scaled. Iâm playing at 1440p on an NVidia 980 and 4790k @4.66. Everything maxed out, didnât notice any frame drops. The game would look good if they released it 5 years ago.  The AI is incredibly dumb, can sneak up on them by walking up to them from any angle practically, shooting sections so far are basically galleries of dumb AI, definitely quantity over quality. Bit in the prologue where you have to get to a boss, and it just keeps spewing unlimited AI unless you advance forward.  In less than 2 hours the game has crashed to desktop twice, and froze once requiring an Alt+F4, a further time I got to an objective and it didnât trigger the next cut scene, so had to restart the game, as it hadnât saved my progress I had to replay the previous 10 minutes. The one saving grace is the story, and cut scenes especially are very well detailed, with fantastic animations and voice acting, just a shame the rest of the game isnât rendered to the same quality.   Iâve played 115 minutes and just finished the prologue, going to refund now on steam and buy it from a key reseller once it's patched a bit, devâs donât deserve much for putting this standard of game out.
12004	Really bad Port!  -30FPs lock, dropping down to 27-29 while driving. -Blurry text and textures. -Before starting the game, you have a choice to turn on auto Aim. -You can only set the Graphics settings in the launcher and after the long intro cutscenes. No options menu in the main Title menu. -There are sound glitches when setting your audio to a higher sample rate. -Bad mouse smoothing in menu, but quite decent in game. -There is an FOV option but increasing it somehow decrease input text size.  I'm really hyped for this game but they sabotaged the PC version (maybe gave us a beta build or something). Can't play for more than 2 minutes with the mouse and keyboard as it gives me migraine. They should have delayed the PC version when they clearly know it's not ready yet. Feels like playing afully priced Early Access game with Season Pass and micro DLC's.    
12005	Game feels like a downgrade from Mafia II  Pros:    Cutscenes facial detail is really good    New weapon mechanic feels good.    References towards Mafia II and events.    Map is well designed    Good voice acting    Story is ok    Spoiler:   Joe's alive?!     Cons:    Police AI, unlike it's predecessor the cops are just dumb, no level system(stars) and no realism like the last game(robbery/speeding ect.)    Where's the customization? Garages, clothing stores, ect?    To many characters = not caring for them. Should've focused more on the Father &amp; Donovan. I didn't feel emotionally connected to the decisions I made in this game like I had before(Mafia II)    Repetitive, doing the same thing over and over again for each territory = boredom.    Dumb settings. Opening the menu to decide for Lethal vs Non Lethal and FPS selection is probably the dumbest â¥â¥â¥â¥ I've seen in a long time.    Textures/Looks. The game looks like trash 90% of the time, the textures looked stretched and unnatural, except for in cut scenes.    Limited detail, unlike Mafia II, this game is just the game and that's it, there's no small details like eating, getting gas, or interacting with anything.    Limited car selection.    Game runs like â¥â¥â¥â¥ across the board, regardless of setting most users don't average above 45 fps.   Conclusion: This game had so much potential but in the end failed. It's repetitive and has a very limited replay ability because of it.   Don't buy this game, just go replay Mafia II. This game is a downgrade.
12006	Ignoring the fact that this once had a 30fps lock on it at launch. The game still runs like â¥â¥â¥â¥. Very poor port from devs. Only getting about 45fps on a 1070 at medium settings at 1080p. And even with everything turned off and on the lowest settings it cannot reach the desired 60fps constantly.   Graphics are a big downside to most people but i couldn't care as long as other major things like draw distance are fixed first.  Considering the massive â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥torm that the pc community give developers when the release sub par ports you would think that developer would try to lift their game and actually produce a good pc port for once. But so far it looks like doing the right thing is just too hard now days.  Sad to see the only game i was looking forward to this year be another game that wont be ready until another 6 months of patches.  Edit: Game cannot run for more thant 10-20 mins without crashing for me. Performance wise i have changed settings everywhere possible and i get 60 fps when there is nothing/no one around. But as soon as i get into town im lucky to keep a solid 40 fps.
12007	GAME CRASH, seriously?? slower than mafia2 and crash? ==== Updated - Found more bugs - Target mark is missing on map and u have to restart the game, happened once - Car driving AI is buggy, they drive like crazy sometime even cop's cars - Background Music was broken, once. - Jacket dances itself sometime - Car bump into (literally) a house for no reason, once - Traffic jammed itself, sometime - Cant turn on the car engine, unless u re-enter the car, once. - Real life navigation system is more reliable than the one in game, it direct me to drive through a bridge then ask me to do u-turn in the middle.  For the gameplay Maybe too soon to say, reverse story telling is kind of anonying.  Updated #2: After 6 hours gameplay kind of boring now. Driving experience and FPS are not as good as mafia1~2 or even GTA and i just get around 2x~3x FPS in gameplay after removed the FPS limit. I used to enjoy driving with my xbox analog controller, but not much fun with this title, not sure it's FPS, the AI, or the physic.    The in-game Menu is not user friendly, the scrolling is so anonlying, why make it complicated while it need to be simple and functional. Accidentally set a destination all the time on map page. Once u set a wrong destination, and u need to figure out how to set back the mission destination. There is no much details in the map... just road, sections, mission target..   And I can find more bugs than fun in this game. HIGHLY RECOMMAND to wait, for bug fixing, for sale, for mafia 4...  === Suggestion to hanger &amp; 2k If the game is not ready, just push back the release date. There is no reason to destory this title by catching up the stupid project timeline. As fans, money is ready for the game, you are the one who refused to take it.  It didn't match the quality of mafia series, more like watch dog with ton of bugs. To be honest, as a software engineer, with that amount of bugs, very likely they did it so wrong at the beginning. With that fundation, I doubt they can fix it (but not re-do the whole thing) without sacrifice anything, like performance (or they already did).   https://youtu.be/6KUVeGtJHfg    https://youtu.be/pReSEgmj5bU 
12008	Pains me to say this, I know the game is locked at 30FPS, that is not my main issue, the issue is that the game does hold at 30 but it stutters, it stutters badly, I do not know if it is because I have a 144hz monitor and I am noticing it more, its not playable in this state for me, such a shame. The game graphics are ok, not 2016 worthy and here's another kicker, it seems upscaled from 720p which could be the blur everyone is reporting, people are asking for an AA option, but realistically only a texture pack is going to fix it.  This is clearly a game for consoles that has been ported at the last min for PC with no love, care or attention, truly shocking, Hanger 13 should be ashamed of themselves right now, I would...  UPDATE 09 10 2016: (I will be fair to the game and update my review as development continues) They have now unlocked the FPS, even with my system I can only reach around 60 fps drops to 50 in parts which is fine, further more by capping at 60 with vsync on all the stuttering I experienced at 30fps has gone, not perfect but not as bad. I will not continue with the campaign at 720p upscaled graphics lol...   i7 5960x / Titan X (2) Maxwel / 64gDDR4 / Win 10 64bit
12009	I really like the main character and the people associated with him. I love the setting (even the bayou lol). The soundtrack is pretty damn good (especially for a bunch of songs i've never heard before). But the mandatory side activities get dull after the 2nd district you take over, turning the awesome setting/characters into a pretty boring experience. The story missions are fun and well done imo. The first major person you take out was in a pretty interesting place that i enjoyed very much. Also... this game just isn't optimized very well at all... there is barely any difference between medium and high. With a 970 and FX-8350 i can't even get the game to run at 60fps/1080p on medium, but the rec specs has a 780 listed -_-. They tackled a touchy subject, had the perfect setting/cast of characters but fell very short on the gameplay side of things. I will keep playing because it was a gift along with the season pass from gmg. But i'd suggest waiting for a huge sale or just avoid entirely. Either way, you won't miss much. Maybe Hangar 13 will polish their next game some more before releasing it.  **UPDATE**  After finishing this game, i must say that John Donovan is officially my favorite video game character of all time. The dude is the pure, uncut definition of awesome. If he gets his own game, I'll buy it just for his character.
12010	  First I want to clear I buy the game from cd keys and that's why is shown for free   The developers requested feedback, here is some problems that must be fixed on the pc.  First there is some very strange blur filter on the pc version. If I lower the AA setting to low the game still have that blur. This filter must be toggle on or off and a sharpen option must be introduced, like in the witcher 3 and deus ex mankind divided. The textures in the game especially on the environment are very low res and for the pc high textures option is needed the current looks like are made for 720p.  Ui scaling is also a must. The ability to switch settings ingame not only from the launcher. Things like tessellation and nvidia gameworks will be a plus. Personally I think the pc version was handle very poorly. It's sad because mafia was a PC francaise.Similar problems in 2016 are not aceptable in any AAA title. I watch the preview gameplay and I love what I saw. I pre order it an and the season pass. Now I'm very disappointed by the technical problems in this promising game.  My advice is wait until all the problems are fixed. The game have a lot of bugs and glitches like the lighting system, draw distance, textures and so on. I will not be surprised if the problems are fixed months after release like Arkham Knight. Until then wait for sale.  Current problems  - blurred overall picture (filter or AA solution)  - Very low res textures no option to switch to hi res version.  - 30 fps lock on pc (unacceptable)  - weather system and lighting dosent work corectly. (cloud shadows move extremely fast)  - physics and animation glitches  - Resolution problems abouve 1080p  - absence of UI scaling  Video samples of the problems   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZokdmzvDGA    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g24KExuSBMk    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXNeDQ4bkGw   Very poor version I dont recomend in current state.
12011	This did not feel like a Mafia game to me...  Good story, I'll give them that, but that's basically where it ends. I literally kept killing the same guys over and over. There was hardly any challenge to the game, if you played the game stealthy. Just crouch behind something, whistle, and kill them when they are close. *YAWN*  Also, a lot of sidemissions are bugged. * Steel a boat ---&gt; No boat there. * Steal the truck ---&gt; No truck there.  Honestly, the bugs I can deal with. Let's face it, almost every game has bugs, but the overall experience I got from this game, is just really bad.  To me, this game was a complete let down.
12012	For a game I've been waiting for for 6 years, it's dreadful - There was close to 0 storyline as most of it is revealed with the whole game following a repetitive line of missions with the odd mission which isn't 'Take down the racket boss'. Never the less I played the game through because it had the title 'Mafia 3' when the game isn't even come close to being worthy of being called that.
12013	I'm going to talk about the storymode and its flaws now: The only thing that holds a story in this game are the cutscenes which can be seen as completely irrelivant to the gameplay, let me explain. So i ignored the fact that they gave us, the pc people a unfinished port. My love for Mafia 2 brought me in a state of disbelieve. Ignoring the glitches and half-baked framerate I went in the game just to get that feeling of rising to the top and feeling like a true mob boss. But the way the missions take place leave so much to be desired. In the main AND side missions you are doing the same ffing thing over and over and over again without the feeling of progress.  I have 12 hours on record and I don't know how, I don't feel like I have achieved anything. The first few hours were amazing but the rest is starting to feel like a waste of time. Now I don't know how far I am in the story but I do know that I have lost interest in driving from point A to B and kill a bunch of people, then driving back to point A to tell them I succeeded in killing a bunch of people. This game made me wish for a quick travel option..  Am I really the boss in this game or am I still a puppet with strings being played?  Haven't we learned from far cry 4 that the hero is often just a slave to the side characters? How (in)appropriate for this game, atleast we got to shoot them kkk members so it's worth am I right?  Why can't I buy clothes? Oh you are going to add 'costumes' in a later patch? Which you probably have to acces via the start menu just like switching between lethal an non lethal kills eh?  Why can't I go to a car dealer and buy cars? I get a set of cars picked for me? For free? Jolly good, such choice.  Why don't the police mind me speeding? Do the police even give tickets? What is their use other then being just another gang. Why is the entire police system a downgrade from mafia 2?  Why are the lockpick mechanics a step down from mafia 2? I could see the freaking lock in that game, even opened cars that way. Now i just bash a window and jump in gta style.. is it cause I'm black?  What happend to the licenseplate system? Yo, that was cool. Why can't I buy a safehouse? All this money, well not really cause you run out of ammo and adrenaline shots so quick that you spend most of your money on it. Because you keep dying cause you can't stand waiting in a corner and whistling until the dumbass ai comes to get killed by you. I wanted to buy houses and fill my garage with cars. It makes the game more personal.  An ingredient to succes for games is putting the player and the main character in different scenario's, this keeps the player interested. Wolfenstein the new order is a great example of this. But even Mafia 2 did this, in the game you lived with your family, stayed with your friend, got a new appartement and stayed in jail. That's progression via different scenario's I expect to see from a open world game in 2016. It adds value and weight to the story you are moving through.  In mafia 3 tho, I don't feel like I'm the character that I am playing. It started of really good by putting me in a situation building up the story but in the next hour or so I've killed so many people that I've emotionaly become disconnected to him and his revenge story. He has one simple goal but decides to go unnecessarily overboard with his plan just like this review. It leaves no desire in getting sidetracked and forgetting about the main missions. Now I just want to do the main missions because I am hoping that there is atleast a bit of light at the end of the tunnel. I was hoping to play mafia 3 and not a serious version of Saints Row(xbox 360). The missions are repetitive and thus you will get bored of this game before you finish it.
12014	~ 4hrs in; Update: 25 hrs in, after first patch   Pros  - Good Story and Presentation (Soundtrack is on point, Interesting Characters, Voice Acting, good Cutscenes) - Keyboard + Mouse works perfectly (driving is still more fun with a controller) - car behaviour in 'Simulation' mode (lets you choose wether you want realism or a more arcade way of driving) - Gun fights (variety of Weapons, Gun behaviour, responsive and direct controls with mouse) - the city is crowded and feels 'alive'  Cons  - 30fps (???) Update: fixed with patch - I had 4 crashes so far (the game just goes back to desktop, no error message or anything; Update: no crashes since patch) - Physics of objects and bodies look clunky sometimes - Graphicglitches with lighting, also Characters have a weird greenish glow on skin and clothes (could be my graphic settings, I dont know) - bad performance optimization - Update: very repetitive mission design (story and optional missions) - Update: missing a lot of little details which we know from M1+M2 (look at the comparison videos on youtube) - absolutely horrible AI (mostly exposed when you choose the stealth approach) - engines sound more like modern V6/V8 rather than the old muscle cars - I dont like the UI  All in all its a good game, but the technical issues are annoying. The PC port feels rushed and unfinished and shouldn't have been released like that. Update: After the first patch and more hrs of gameplay, its still a thumbs down. I dont really mind the weird graphic glitches or the blurryness or the horrible textures or how bad this game is running on somewhat good PCs. What really kills it for me is the mission design and the lack of those little details which I loved in Mafia 1 and Mafia 2. Why would you remove the speedlimiter? Why do cops not care when you pass them with 200km/h? Why do they shoot on sight, instead of arresting you, giving you a ticket? And the list goes on and on.... At least it was not 60â¬ like some other crappy games.
12015	Pros:  - Nice story - Seemless animations for Lincoln - Satisfying gunplay - Absolute tip top music  Cons:  - Struggles to hit 60 when cars are on screen on a 980ti - graphical downgrade - 512 x 512 upscaled textures - graphical bugs out the wazoo - launcher doesn't remember the settings you told it to use - no msaa - forced fxaa - can't disable fxaa it in control panel because the launcher doesn't remember you set it to low - no cocking animation for the model 1887 between shots - intro stops after 2 hour mark because money - dog â¥â¥â¥â¥ ai that can't see a bumbling 6'4' man in a clunky jacket 5 feet infront of their face all because he's pushed v to hunch over
12016	Stutters like mad while driving on lowest possible settings. PC - i5 3570k @ 4,2 GHZ, GTX 970, 16 GB Ram. 35-50 fps while driving, sometimes 60 on foot but there's a lot of frame pacing issues and stuttering. Blurry graphics, low resolution textures, repetitive missions structure, lots of bugs, extremely dumb AI.
12017	Here we go, my first review ever.  I were superhyped about Mafia 3. I've played the first and secod countless of hours and enjoyed almost every minute of them. Sadly, the third did not meet my expectations. Not at all. Not even close  Though the story and cut scenes are very good it does not compensate the extremely bad game. This is nothing like Mafia or Mafia 2. This is some kind of gta remake in the sixties. All you do is kill a lot of people whitout any meaning.  The game is so poorly optimized so it will most certenailly lag or in other ways not work.  The mission was fun, maybe once or twice. The 38th time you did it, not so much. In Mafia 2 there were a lot of different missions, like robbing a place with stamps and infiltrating a hotel. This was just the same two or three missions all the time.   I cannot recomend this game to anyone, sadly. I love the first two game so much. Besides Ocarina of time, I would say that Mafia 2 is my absolute favourite game. So if you liked Mafia 2, do not buy this game. You'll get dissapointed.   Please bring 2k czech back for the next game.
12018	Quality of this game is like early access.
12019	I loved mafia II. I realy wanted this game to be as good. after taking all 3 first bosses i can't say it is... it's not a bad game, but it's not a AAA game either on 2016.   soundtruck is amazing,the art concept also nice,realy it's nice. the most thrriling part is the driving handlling, while listning to the guitars and flyin over the biutyfull bayou scenery. but thats about it.   the game is like BorderLands, go kill go fetch. and it's all repetitive, and get real easy to kill enemis stealth or if you choose to go guns blazing all the same. but it's not the worst game. it's got a story line. only problem is, that the story is as hard as the story of DoubleDragon. all family members are killed, revenge. the grafics are quite pour, yet 970 oc cant work on 60 fps, its struggel to stay above 40 on medium, and realy for no reason, for a game that looks like last gen. we've seen a lot beter looking games like GTA V ,witcher 3 ,mad max ,assassin creed paris and london, who worked perfectly fine on high or super high on 60 fps. it's optimise poorly. the port is as bad for pc. game play is a bit fun, in the first repits. but if i could take back time i would have paid 39 on releas not a peny more. probably wait for 50% even.  forgot to add  the pointles 'are we cool' and 'seems simpel enough' objectives in the bayou are broken. send me to empty places where at first was what suppose to be.
12020	I mistook the story missions for side missions...
12021	gtx 1080, i5-4690k even with the FORCED 30fps cap the game still stutters and performs terribly.   Graphic settings lead a lot to be desired.   *Horrible bluring, probably some caused by FXAA which cannot be turned off beleive it or not. But most bluring comes from depth of field setting which can be turned off thank god. It blurs everything in the distance constantly.  *some blury textures, and some reasonable textures. but obvious inconsistency. *30 fps cap that doesnt even frame pace to 30 fps properly.  *no borderless window option  *launcher graphic settings do not apply to game once loaded  And yes, this does massively affect the gameplay and enjoyment level. So pople who say its all about story, etc, are missing the point about good art, and how good art/performance/tech can increase immersion and impress upon people.   THIS FEELS LIKE RUSHED TECH. THE MAFIA 2 ENGINE PERFORMED BETTER THAN THIS NEW ENGINE THEY BUILT
12022	Just to start off , i'm a big Mafia fan and this game was very dissapointing for me .  Here we go  Edit:I just tried to finish the game but i can't ,it's really boring because of these â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ repetitive missions.   Pros:  -The story is great -Level-Design is great -Sountrack is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing great  -The voice-acting is great  -The facial animation are perfect  -The combat was inproved in some ways (and downgraded ...). -The collectives are great (if you know what i mean ( Í¡Â° ÍÊ Í¡Â°) .  Now we get in to the dissaponting part   really dissapointing  .  Cons: -Bad optimized (can't even hit 60 fps with my gtx 980). -Great future removed from the other games (i will link some videos to let you guys see). -Very repetitive missions (and you have to complete them to get further in to the story). -Very ugly textures and effects (there are some fixes online to make them look better). -Alot of bugs (on the level of bethesda games...). -Dumb AI  -Enemies look almost identical (i mean wtf , it's 2016 ...).  Here are the videos   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ1YMeY07xI    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=getp6QCcdqg    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixlszwKVVP0    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHjeDvnSPPA   Buy it when it's on sell if you really want it if not just stay away from it .  Edit:Some futures were restored (car customization and outfits).  6/10
12023	  Still Not There Yet
12024	EDIT: So the fps unlocking patch has been released and behold the game can't run stable 60 fps on a 1080 GTX even, it fluctuates between 40-58 fps using the 60 fps limit and G-Sync seems to be handling it quite well. However there's till frame timing issues every now and then that cause major stuttering even if it's running at around 50 fps.  Game has three major technical issues that makes it very hard to recommend this game to anyone who has issues graphical issues.  1. 30 FPS lock, controls are very sluggish and it basically feels like playing on a console when you try to aim with the mouse, it's actually preferable to play with a controller at all times for me right now at least.  2. The lightning in the game has some very bad issues. First of all light sources have a very low view distance keep popping in. Secondly shadows seem to render on and off just by turning the camera a bit back and forth without moving yourself on certain objects.  3. THE BLUR... everything looks like someone smudged it with some acid or something, like it isn't enough that the textures look a blurry mess from the start they decide to blur it and then blur it some more! NOTE: It's mostly the anti aliasing technique (FXAA) causing this, setting it to low actually improves the graphics as long as your resolution is high enough to compensate the jaggies.  Other bugs would include some very strange physics in the game with ragdolls bouncing around as well as objects not rendering at all (Had a bunch floating stuff that I could walk into in a garage only to suddenly spawn a table underneath when I entered the car). Had a single CTD crash just as loading screen started about 1 hour into the game but then no problems for the rest of my session. Seen the exact same rendering and CTD issue on some streamers so it's a game issue.  The good part so far is that voices, lip syncing and close up models look good and the story has also been quite intriguing and fun. However the missions themselves are starting to feel very repetitive.  Will update the review as I go along but seriously why would you go some much backwards from Mafia 2 or even Mafia 1 from a technical aspect....
12025	Let's start by saying the game in gameplay and story aspects feels great, the story is very intriguing and it is really motivating. Basically, the concept of the game is similar to that of The Godfather 2, where you hurt gangs by taking their business and make them yours, only thing there's a bigger goal in this story. The protagonist is damn strong and i like him since he seems always confident about his purpose. The combat is great, the mechanics and finishers are badass, corpses remain with bloodshed and do not disappear, blood is splattered against wall, the animations of how enemies react by being shot are similar to GTA V. That being said, the game is trash in perfomance and graphics, it is very hardware demanding for its mediocre graphics, no wonder they locked it at 30fps. I've got a 1080 and i can barely maintain solid 60fps in open areas at 1080p &amp; Ultra, if the game was nice looking i could deal with this, but it is really not. The fact that people have had to install optional graphical settings like ENB, Sweet FX and reshade is embarrassing for a fresh released AAA. I'd recommend everyone to wait, because i really want to enjoy this game, but not in its actual state. I'll be adquiring a Titan X Pascal in a month i will update this review upon completion of the game asuming it's been patched significantly.

12026	I dont recommend at all!  reasons:  Graphical issues:    http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=776343050    http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=776346702    http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=776346792    Im having a problem of CTD every 30 mins or so, my latest CTD was me just driving around  sound fx cutting out  you got convertables but cant put the top down or up  no damage on cars... at all and im using sim style driving  motion blur keeps turning back on  no speed limiter! does 2k know how annoying it is to keep tapping W when driving past the cops? (also there are no road signs i have seen for the speed limit! what are the speed limits!?)   no glass smashing sound when breaking into cars just a thud  not a lot to do right now other than doing story missions (the story is great so far)  Cant turn the mirror off in the car  the enter vehicle sign stays on for me when entering vehicle in passanger side  No NPC slider (variety or density) or traffic slider for density, which it needs as the whole city seems dead   Oh and having to go into the options to switch between non-lethal and lethal takedowns is a tedious thing to do  30fps &amp; a tiny bit worse graphics than mafia2 (characters hair) are a minor for me right now with these problems im having,  it needs an update fast for extra things to do and optimisation then i will update this review and more than likely change it to a yes i can recommend  *edit*  Despite updates the game still CTDs.  lighting and multiple bugs have not been fixed.  No point in changing the settings before you launch the game as they dont change in game so you'll have to do it from the options menu again.  All the missions are repetative, i know all games are but when you have to repeat the same missions over and over again that isnt a quality game.  Here's the full game...  go here take this down or tail someone,  Kill or save?   come back to me,  kill this guy,   assign whoever,   kill the leader of the district  and repeat.  still nothing to do other than story missions  AI are the dumbest i have ever encountered in a game  it get really boring after an hour of play  Just wait for a sale or dont bother at all.
12027	If you're looking to play Mafia 3 because of Mafia 2, don't buy this game. Why? Because for each territory you about to take-over there are plenty of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ side-quests in it. And you basically do the same â¥â¥â¥â¥ over and over again for like 15-20 hours? And not just that it took me less than 30 hours just to finish the whole game without any side-quests. Plus you can't even customize your appearance or your cars (just yet). And in order to make the game more fun to play you have to buy the season pass which include 3 more missions, if only you have $20 extra to add in for your game or buy it with $30 extra if you already buy the game. Afterall I really don't recommend the game, And Mafia 3 really disappointed me. It gave me a feeling of Watch Dog game.  PS: The only part that's satisfy me is what happen to Joe.
12028	One month after the release, the game is still poorly optimized for PC. No new info if this is ever going to be fixed.
12029	tl;dr 6/10 buy but when discounted.  +combat system + stealth +driving physics +soundtrack +storyline +ending + joe resolution  - most of story line are repetetive 'secondary-like' quests - glitchy wierd outdated graphics /draw distance fog and else - crash physics - glitches and bugs  Might give it a thumbs up if it wasnt in a Mafia series, did not live up to the name.
12030	grindy and repetitive, fun for a few hours, then its boring. pretty average graphics too, AI are dumb as dumb can be.
12031	Unfortunately I was very disappointed with this game. Let's just forget that they released the game locked at 30fps....low blow to the pc community. After they unlocked the framerate to 60, you could see even more that the game was really badly optimized. It is sometimes glitchy and I was lucky enough to never encounter any lighting issues or clip issues or gamebreaking bugs/crashes.  That said, the game actually began as a great game. Graphically is nothing special but also nothing too bad. I really enjoyed the game in the beginning, many things reminded me of the old dear first Mafia rather than the second one (which I also liked by the way). The driving was great and shooting was also a very nice feeling. Narration started very interesting and the story began like it had a lot to offer, everything was very promising. Sadly after a few hours you notice that all you have to do are repetitive tasks: damage this racket, kill this guy, steal this truck. Those are not even side missions: you need to complete these tasks to progress in the 'main' story. Which revealed itself to be no real story at all. I was not able to finish the game because of all this nonsense. I doubt the ending would be a lightbringer. I progressed to what looks to be 75% of the main story (I checked a walkthrough with a mission list) and really can't force myself to finish it.  In a way it behaves like a Just Cause game....damage this, damage that, kill bad guys in the meantime, go around with the car etc etc.....but Just Cause has a reason to exist because it focuses exactly on that, and it does it well. Also every Just Cause had good graphics to begin with. This Mafia has no real purpose, no real identity or story, and on top of that there are all the various glitches/framerate drops and average graphics. I preordered it thinking that being 2K the publisher, it could not be THAT bad (they always released good games). Also I liked Mafia 2, it obviously it was not as good as the first Mafia, but I thought this third one would have been more or less on the same level with Mafia 2. Nope, not the case.
12032	Mafia 3 has crashed on me multiple times , it's good that they unlocked the FPS controlls and I have unlimited but after 5 hours of game time I have exited my game only too come back and my save file was completley corrupted and wanted me too start from the begining again.  I am running this on my Alienware 15 and what I first thought was cool ( My key board flashing red and blue when I am being chased by the police) it randomly decided too freak out and flash like crazy in a multitude of colours and was causing me a mini freak out and I had too restart my computer .   there's a ton of other amusing glitches , ( charcters repeating 2 lines of dialog in a panic, people flying back with one pistol shot, random cars being on their side blocking the road , mirrors acting like fun house mirrors that are paused) Etc   The game is clearly a broken mess, and it's hard to reccomend with such an intresting and exciting story which I now have too repeat ...  wait for this game too go on sale or be fixed but that's unlikely but save your money for now, I was sadly bought into the hype by playing the previous 2 installments hoping this would be the best and It's clearly the worst quality wise.  Update: I have had my progress wiped 3 times now by corrupt saves past the point of talking too the Voice. IT IS BROKEN!
12033	Flop of the year. stay away. bad bad bad. it's 2000 not 2016 in terms of gameplay and graphics.  My money is lost. save yours.
12034	  butchered and downgraded version of Mafia 2, shouldn't be called Mafia game really   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixlszwKVVP0      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHjeDvnSPPA 
12035	This feel like a poor wananbe GTA to be honest, loved both Mafia 1 and 2 because it had some small features who stod out and made them special.  Few things that i loved about mafia games that are missing in this: 1: Simulation mode for cars, for added difficulty. The simulation mode in Mafia 3 is arcade at best. impossible to loose control of the car.  2: Cops who care about the public safety, here they dont care if you drive 120 mph across red light in opposide side of the road. 3: Shops who serve a purpose, in mafia 1 and 2 you could get food, clothes, upgrades in shops. in Mafia 3 they are empty husk who serve no purpose.  GFX in this game looks ok from a distance, but once you get closer it looks like they stopped development before the final finish. So far the only thing i like about the game is that it is honest to history and dont try and cover up rasicm, and actualy use it to its advantage.  So far i am far from impressed and quite disapointed  Edit October 8, 11:00 BST  Cargo: Cargo crates are welted, glued and bolted to the chassis of the car/truck you drive, so when transporting moonshine or weed there is no chance of damage the good like in Mafie 1 and 2, such a shame that they cut this feature too.  A.I. : or lack of it, npc dont reach to firefight 5-10 meters from them if there is a small garden wodden fence in the way, at one point i shot 3 npc enemy on enemy territory, and 10 meters away there where another 3 enemies who kept talking and havent heard the gun shots.  Copy and paste: Starting to see the same building and building layout over and over again, they have not even bothered to change the colours on walls or anything to make them look even a tiny bit different.  Final edit October 10, 11:00 BST  Finaly completed the game and can give a final review, reason for amount of hours is lots of time afk in game.  Found a few more things that realy got to annoy me the more time i spend in the game.  1. Repedative: Do the same missions over and over again, attack a certain building in a area to lure out the leader of the area only to have to go back to exact same building after you done enough damage to lure him out, becomes realy repedative.  2. Encrease area value: When taking over a area you can increase the area value a bit by doing a side mission, this could be steal weed, moonshine or a truck. But once the area is at max, you still get the side mission icons on the map, but the area is empty and you cant do any thing there. Realy annoying that you are told you can do a mission that you cannot do because your 'racket' value is at max.  3. Cops: Cops serve no real purpose in the game other than to annoy you and make A.I. look stupid. Killed of most of the guest in a dinner and cops where called, they never went to the dinner i stod outside off and gave up the seach, there was also 3 cops standing 30-50 meters away from diner but they could not be bothered to go there.  They dont care about you breaking every single traffic rule, and if a mobster starts shooting at you and you dont draw your weapon but run and hide, the cops will start hunting you too, but will not care about the mobster who is unloading his tommygun in your general direction no matter what he hit.   4. GFX: running at max everything 1920*1080, npc looks so bad when you get close to them, hair looks like plastic wigs, mirrors was better in the game Duke nukem from 1991. cutscenes looks almost same quality as Mafia 2.   Final Vedict:  If you like Mafia 1 and 2, then dont get this game because it is not a mafia game in my mind, they have left out all the things that made mafia 1 and 2 stand out from games like GTA or Saints Row. And even left out things that are/was standard in Mafia 2/ GTA or Saints Row, like minor customizing. If you want a open world game then get GTA 4 or 5, they are far better than this, and offer much more things to do, and are superior to this game in every way. And that is a real shame, since i love mafia 1 and 2.
12036	Refunded, as the game doesn't run at stable 60 fps on the following PC even with all settings at lowest@1080p:  i5 4670k 4.6ghz gtx 970 1.5ghz/8ghz 16gb ddr3 2400mhz Samsung 840 pro 256gb SSD win10 64  Don't bother with the game unless you can handle FPS drops below 60fps, don't mind 30fps lock, or have an i7 5xxx/6xxx and a gtx1060 or better GPU for stable 60fps@1080p. as for 1440p, not even a gtx1080 can max it out at stable 60fps.  It's also worth noting that the devs have entered the Soonâ¢ mode when it comes to patching the game.  Updated with a video so you can see for yourself how it behaves in a cpu limited area.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omZv7mkmaYI&amp;feature=youtu.be    On the other hand, if you don't mind sub 60 fps, the game feels much smoother once you fully shift into GPU limited territory, for example, at max settings. The downside is, if you game at 60 fps all the time, you might feel nausea until your brain adapts to lower framerate.   https://youtu.be/hmGc5rKBpbE 
12037	I was really looking forward to this game, because Mafia 2 was one of my favorite games the year it was released. But Mafia 3, oh man.. I'll go over the positives and the negatives.  + Game looks really good sometimes + Story is somewhat interesting + Some main missions are really cool  - The game doesn't run that well (I got a GTX 1080, I expect a solid 60 fps at 1440p, and I don't get it). - It doesn't feel like a Mafia game, it feels like a GTA clone in the 1960's - 1970's. - Repetetive side missions, even the main missions.  - Sometimes the game looks really bad, the skyboxes, draw distance look like â¥â¥â¥â¥ most of the time.   I could recommend this game for 29.99 or 34.99, not for 49.99 though.
12038	Blatant console port.  comes with purple haze setting  http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/251464760163000824/52D606B9BB619DFF0BD16599E9BBFC17C7A2E283/?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;output-format=jpeg&amp;output-quality=95&amp;fit=inside|2048:857&amp;composite-to%3D%2A%2C%2A%7C2048%3A857&amp;background-color=black   Shocking draw distances.  Graphics are a let down.  You can set screen size, but it doesn't account properly for ultra wide monitors, despite supporting the resolution - see this screenshot  http://steamcommunity.com/id/age_uk/screenshots/?appid=360430   The menu interface is broken when the game loads and mostly unusable.Which makes for a poor experience right from the word go.   There are some upsides though. Driving mechanics are enjoyable. Shooting people leads to them falling down and wailing in pain and misery on the floor, writhing around. This adds to the immersion and makes it feel more brutal when you pop over to finish them off.   The characters and the acting is fairly good. I think once it's patched a bit more it'll improve vastly. Just a shame the shambles was released like this in the first place.
12039	Pros: + great storyline and great characters + many decisions on how to take control of the city + attention to story details + nice landscapes  Cons: - many bugs: mission related and not (felt in the river and had to swim for 10 minutes to get out of there although the slope was ok for that) - after some time it gets repetitive although the bosses businesses are diverse - AI dumb: make some noise outside of a big building, and a guy from the first floor walks for 1 minute directly to you - AI very dumb: sometimes they will come one by one at you even though they are really far away - Escape police in car way to easy - no multiplayer / ko-op - the car chases are made of adamantium: not a scratch after a full frontal crash  Summary:  For the current price i don't recommend it, although i loved Mafia 2 a lot and was looking forward to this game. Wait for a Sale for it. 
12040	I wanted to like this game, I really did.   Mafia II, while having some issues was a solid game, it lacked enough side activities to truly be considered an Open World game in my option, but the story left you wanting to play more, to see new cars as time ticked by, and try different tactics to siege a base, or objective.  Mafia III is just...dull. It doesn't know what it wwants to be, having gone with an open world feel ,but having lifeless side activities. Go to X, steal this truck. Go to X, steal this boat, go to X, steal the pick up. This would be somewaht forgivable, if the main uests were more exciting, but they are unfortuantly not.  Main quests are a hamster wheel of repeated tasks. Kill 2 smaller bosses after completing enough side quests to reveal the main boss of the area, kill the main boss in a linear attack vector so that we can set up a show piece.  In the current format I cannot honestly reccomend this game, you are better off picking up GTA, or Saints Row as both have more character, and are better Open worlds depending on your choice of super campyness, or somewaht more realistic story lines.
12041	I will reconsider changing this review if the supposed weekend patch sorts these issues out.  Even if I may not have the most high-end system, I should be somewhere in the middle of the minmum and recommend requirements for this game, but the game looks awful at the lowest settings and runs horrible for something to looks so bad. The game is also locked to 30 FPS and the settings are subpar for a PC-game. The fact that you cant even use a mouse is the menu says alot about the console port that this is.  And even if I may not have been completely sober when buying it, I made the mistake of getting somewhat hyped for this title and preordered it as a result, even going off work a bit early in the hopes of playing it. The lack of review copies and other independet previews should show that the developers or atleast the publisher knew full well what they were doing and it seems really strange to announce that a patch that will fix FPS and settings issues will be released a few days after the actual release, although we will see how this actually works out.  Hopefully upcoming updates fix these inherrent issues, but if not I will refund it and would not recommend to anyone unless they fix it.  Update after the weekend patch: While it runs better it's far from optimal and still feels like a rather half-â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ port in many aspects, and after playing it for a bit I reached the conclusion that this was really not for me.  So I ended up refunding it after all, may buy it at a cheaper price in the future depending on the situation. The first part of the review will remain as it is important to remember how much they messed up the initial launch.
12042	I had previously put a positive review for this game, however after playing the game further it has become quite clear that the missions are completely boring and unoriginal. Most of them follow the formula of 'go to marker - kill guy / destroy stuff - repeat - ok now go back to the original marker and kill guy'.  I've also changed my mind because the patch that was supposed to address the 30fps lock is useless. This game is an unoptimised mess and even with the patch I barely push past 30fps. In fact, in the Bayou I struggle to get 20fps! This is despite the fact that the graphics are nowhere near what should be considered demanding on a system.  To top it all off, this game is a buggy mess. The game constantly crashes. The latest crash happened during a cutscene at the end of a story mission. I rebooted the game and the checkpoint takes me to the end of the mission, as if the cutscene had just ended, however the objective still says I need to complete the mission. If I die, it says mission failed. I can't continue the game and I can't reload a past save because hey, who needs saves when you auto checkpoints right guys?  I have now lost my temper with this game and uninstalled it.
12043	Mafia II looked way better, and played way better. This is just 2k embarrassing themselves.  Release a HD patch or something, holy crackers the game just looks horrible and crashes all the time  Update: 6 hours in and the game is incredibly repetitive.  'Kill this guy, so you can kill this guy, so you can kill that other guy'  The story seems alright but i can't look past just how horrible everything else is. I feel robbed.  Will play more just cause i can't refund it, but i don't see any light in the end of this tunnel so far
12044	I don't usually write reviews, but this time I genuinely want to express my thoughts:  THIS GAME IS BAD!   As you probably know, there is a 30FPS lock (which according to Mafia III official page, will be fixed soon), gameplay feels wonky (shooting is okay), the AI probably has inner monologue which would explain some funny reaction delays and decisions, and the game looks and feels outdated... Like  last-gen  outdated.  If you really want this game, check the reviews to see if anything was fixed. In this state, I wouldn't recommend it to anybody.   EDIT:  Forgot to mention the odd traffic. As I was driving around, I noticed some cars abruptly changing their paths, or driving in a zig-zag style. This happened with a cop car as well, which was going in the right direction, and all of a sudden it made a sharp 'jump' (it looked like the car re-spawned) and appeared 15 meters right in front of me. Needless to say, we crashed...  There also appear to be issues with lighting, where objects are improperly lit.  The only thing I liked in this game are those cutscenes that look like interviews. They are detailed and the facial animations are gorgeous.  This was my first and quite possibly the last pre-order, I'm glad Steam has a refund system in place. Thank you Valve!
12045	Is there an award for the worst game of the year?
12046	I'm not even going to comment on the obvious optimization problems with the game, my focus is the story. It appears the good people at 2K decided to go political, but not in any kind smart meaningful way. Basically, think of every negative 60s southern white stereotype then magnify it by 100. In the Mafia III world, all whites use N every other word and if you weren't a crooked cop involved in a conspiracy to keep the Black man down, you were an overalls wearing, black woman â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, moonshine swilling hillbilly. I found myself actually laughing during the Dixie gang missions because it reminded me so much of Redneck Rampage(not a good thing). And again having black people on street corners with their very in depth two line conversations about LBJ and Nixon is equally as laughable. 2K's attempt to tie Mafia III to any kind of serious vietnam/civil rights commentary is akin to a 'Jack the Ripper' game trying to make the Women's Suffrage movement a large part of the storyline. Let's not forget who we are here Mafia series, let's cut to the chase. This game glorifies and celebrates the Mafia. An organization which has infected arguably the highest levels of American government, corrupting and killing untold numbers over many decades. Like GTA, Saint's Row, and others, gamers check their brains and morality at the door while pretending to be thieving mass murderers. To even attempt such political commentary in a game like this brings 2K's taste and judgement into question. When it comes to history, stick to what you know, clothes, cars, guns, and nudie magazines. The shallow end of the pool is where you should be swimming 2K, don't stray from it.
12047	 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=776257037   Nutshell: So an arms dealer is upset that she was shutdown because police think black people will buy guns and shoot white people. The main character then proceeds to buy a gun from her and shoot white people. This is one very confused game.   Cons:  - Buggy in general  - Floating objects  - Lighting issues  - Clipping with objects  - NPCs that can be pulled through walls  - Story is a contradiction of itself and poorly presented.  - Plays exactly the same as every other open world game you have already played.     Pros:  + Soundtrack  + Runs smoothly for the most part (ignoring the FPS drama)     The game has been poorly written and it's hard to feel sympathy or understanding when the developer keeps undoing the points they think they are trying to make. In one scene they will try to show how poorly black people were spoken to with name calling. But then right after that, the black characters themselves will call other black characters 'N****R' and 'Coon-asses'  Another example is when a scene is set up to make the player feel sympathy for a poor woman 'Abused and used' by a horrible man that the character is required to kill, and then once again undoes the whole scene by later revealing that she was faking it all. Why? For what purpose?  The dev fails at trying to make a statement with the narrative by trying to play both sides. Don't try and garner sympathy and understanding for a character's plight when they themselves are a thief and mass murderer. Pick one and stick to it.   At the moment I couldn't recommend this game to anyone for either the gameplay or the story.   -------------------------- i7-4790K @ 4.00Ghz MSI GeForce GTX 980Ti Gaming 6GB 16GB ram ASRock Z97 Extreme6 Samsung 850 EVO Series 1TB SSD
12048	This is only a Mafia game by name, almost no other connection to Mafia 2. What a ripoff  In Mafia 2 you can go into car shops to customize everything from wheels to paint to the license plate. Go into clothing stores and buy different suits, and go to diners to eat and restore health. You have several different homes all with a garage where you can STORE YOUR CARS AND KEEP THEM FOR LATER. The characters are fleshed out and actually make you care about them. None of this is in Mafia 3  In Mafia 3 you play as a jarhead Vietnam vet that lives in the basement of a burnt-out bar for the entire game like a troll, wears the same jacket every day. You have a set of 6 cars (not counting the ones on the street) you can chose from that you can upgrade, you can't change paint/license plate/wheels though. The characters are laughable and you never develope any sort of connection to them the way you do in Mafia 2. And worst of all is the gameplay, it â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sucks. The entire game consists of: Receive mission from dude, Kill/Interrogate this dude, do it again, do it again, go back to original dude, kill boss, rinse, repeat. â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game, the only attachment to Mafia 2 is the fact that Vito is added as one of the side characters, and Leo Galante is referenced several times and makes an extremely brief appearence near the end of the game.   4.5/10, don't waste your â¥â¥â¥â¥ing money on this.
12049	Steam should be held accountable for collusion with the developers.  Screens and videos do not match the game istelf.  Game is so poorly optimized, it will actually hurt your eyes. Worked at a steady 30fps last night, now I can only get 5fps.  Can I sue for punitive damages? I for one, am tired of games like this poorly polished console port being allowed on the Steam Store.
12050	AT LAUNCH:  VERY BAD Optimizations for PCs VERY BLURRY Graphics (with Motion Blur off) LOOKS 720p BADLY TEARING even with VSYNC ON 30FPS LOCKED (WTF!!!!!) NO CROSSFIRE/ SLI Support  Refuse to Play until fixes  GET IT TOGETHER 2K 
12051	  This game isn't awful   , but you'll get easly bored by this game after 5-6 hours. The missions are so similar, that it's feels like you are repeating them over and over. And the only reason you may bother to do that is to experience the storyline which has quality. I like the fact they aren't pâ«ssyfoting around subjects like racism. And I also like the soundtrack.   I have never understood why someone would watch others play games on youtube (and similar channels), but after experiencing this game i do understand. I would rather watch someone else play this game than play it myself, maybe even by someone as goofy as 'pewdiepie'. It might even be fun to see the boredom of this game suck the 'life-force' out of them, and maybe they will even question their existence in life and on youtube.
12052	Lots of fetch quest and 'busy work'. Story is nice tho. 6/10
12053	This game is mediocre at best and lacks feature that made the 2nd in the franchise pretty fun to play. I think if they would of added a Shadow of Mordor general type of system with mob bosses and luitenants it would of been much better. To sum it up, Mafia III is like playing an outdated Mafia sequel with better eye candy.   Cons:  ~Very repetitive, for example: Missions, animations, and music that makes the game feel more like a grind than enjoyable.  ~Weird lighting that makes lakes/rivers glow like the sun when the sky is dark and cloudy.  ~Arcade feel all around. ~Classic mafia gameplay that has less features than Mafia II.   Pros:  ~Decent graphics.  ~Voice acting and facial animations are very good. ~Colectable bewbies. ~The stealth system. ~The story so far is predictable but, still enjoyable.
12054	i was really excited for the game....its pretty and the story is cool but the game is overly repetitive
12055	So, as with just about every game thats released these days Mafia 3 needs more. More of what you may ask. More of everything. It's not a bad game. Very much in the vein of GTA, but with less to do. 45hrs in and I'm quickly running out of things to entertain me.   The missions vary in location, however the mechanics of each engagement are almost identical, especially once you get a silenced pistol: Pick off senries or patrols, move in to the interior ring of patrols in stealth, pick off (either headshot or whistle/stab) further guards until you confront the boss. Usually a grenade in the final room is a quick and efficient way of clearing the boss and anyone else unlucky enough to be in the room with them.  'Interrogating' informants? Nah, just shoot them in the head. No need to 'chase' them down. Just shoot them and they'll kneel in place waiting to spill the beans.  Mafia 3 rewards stealth gameplay more than any other. This is a little odd as the Mafia are not remembered because of their invisibility.   If you're looking for an open world crime game then GTA V would be a better choice if I'm honest. I've enjoyed Mafia 3 and don't regret buying it, the world thats been created is both beautiful and brutal. However boredom is now setting in. Theres only so long I can do the same things over and over and over.  There will obviously be DLC for this game (getting so tired of this model. The passion for creating a profit over a product), perhaps I'll revist then, or perhaps not.
12056	UPDATE at 9th of October 2016  It is just fair to give you informations about the last patch:  To make it short: nothing has changed concerning freezes, crashes and bluescreens. Every 30 minutes the game decides to kill my PC and I have to make a hard reset.  Also the keyboard mapping has not become better. Double bindings are still not possible and extra mouse keys (thumb keys) are still not supported.  At the moment: Stay away from this game until they have fixed it.  Considering the bad textures, developers might be interesting in updating those too.  Framelock has been lifted. Possibility for unlimited frames. Does not really change a lot.  ***  Freeze, crashes, restart, crash, stutter, lag and pixelated textures. Even after reinstalling newest nvidia driver, crashes and now the game even starts in German, but crashes immediately. 30 fps lock did actually not bother me for the 20 minutes I played it.  I am sure the story is interesting, I am sure the dialogues are great and the experience in Nouvelles OrlÃ©ans is going to be new and cool. But before I actually can experience this, I am pressed to unfortunately give this game a negative rating.   Besides of the mentionned crashes, the 20 minutes I played, I did not like that the controller settings do not allow to bind extra mouse keys, that double bindings of keyboard keys is not properly solved. That the camera is jumping back to default even if you turn it with the mouse in another direction. These are all typical console port problems you will get from a bad port. It is actually a shame that 2K has been recently developping mostly very messed up games. I remember that they have been top in PC development. But sorry, this port, this release, this so called expensive AAA game is a mess.   Now we know again why no PC reviews have been available before release. I do not want to refund the game, because I am sure that I like the game - if I am able to play it -, but the developers have to work fast and hard now to patch all those problems out, in order to give the PC community just a normal port of a decent game. Did we ask too much?  Until then, I can't recommend the game. This is hopefully going to change in a few days and I am willing then to review of course my position then.   Besides of this. No native 3D vision support is also a big let down. But I understand, asking for this at the actual state of Mafia 3 on release day is simply too much.  You want to compare Mafia III to GTA V. Forget it! I just say worlds in between.  Developers, get to work on PC patches and fixes !!!
12057	First, the game won't even start if you have an older AMD CPU with no SSE4.1 support that is otherwise perfectly capable of handling a game of this level of complexity.  Even No Man's Buy devs had had this issue sorted within a day after launch IIRC.   Then there's the 30 FPS cap that has no reason to be there because the picture is apparently upscaled from 900p so  any  half-decent GPU should have no trouble rendering this blurry mess at 45-60 FPS.  And of course there're crashes and freezes and all kinds of hiccups that will happen at least once per hour on average.  However good the story and gameplay may be, this is a completely botched port hastily copy-pasted from consoles. Please show some self-respect as a PC gamer and don't buy this game until it's properly fixed  and  50% off. This level of incompetence on the devs' part  should  be bad for their business.  Refunded.
12058	I went to a games expo on the last weekend and the video demo was great. But it was a video.  I have a gtx 970 with 16 GB of ram. all but the GPU is new from this year.  Game is locked at 30 FPS and at high/max setting, it doesnt look good as the videos.... besides the cutscenes, which look like 1080p. Also the game crashed 2 times. going from the cutscenes to gameplay.  For the 1 hour and 50 mins I've been playing. the story looks good.  I hope they fix this or I'm getting my money back.
12059	Stay away and spare your wallet.  I mean, It was boring. And it lacked the signature mafia feeling that we learned to love in mafia 1 and 2. it feels as the game almost tries to be more like gta in order to appeal to a wider audience, but it fails misserably. It has alot of bugs and is as optimized as a potatoe. The driving is sluggish and dosent feel right. The game is very repetetive as you need to do basically the same thing 8 times per district and there are 6 districts. The game isnt even hard as i played it on hard and thought it was easy. There are no options like customizing cars or clothing and it lacked in small details which led to the world just feeling a little bland and dead. The AI is as stupid as a rock. It has some annoying elements to it. Like you loose half of your money you have on you when you die so you need to store it. There arent that much you can spend it on other than weapons and upgrades like vehicle upgrades which is just a wasted opportunity opposed to having an actual vehicle customization system. You can also buy upgrades for Lincoln which is also wasted opportunity as a level / progression system could have been in place instead. The story missions are good If somewhat mediocre And The cutscenes look amazing. The gun play is on point and The soundtrack is Great. Overall.. Its just a repetetive mediocre experience
12060	This game was made for console players with their restricted outdated hardware and thrown to PC as a cheap port. The graphic options are a joke and the graphic itself doesn't even nearly look like 2015 or 16's PC standard. It's a blurry upscaled mess.  They knew exactly why they didn't allow any testing reviews before the release.  An unfinished game but demanding the full price.  For all those whining fanboys:  Yes, we are on Steam platform and not XBOX Marketplace or Playstation Store. So i await a game on PC standards.  I took a refund and as long as all this mess isn't going to be patched i'll keep my negative review.  Ich habe fertig!  Specs: i7-6700k 16 GB RAM 2x 980ti SLI
12061	the frame rate is unlocked now and they fixed the weird resolution/blur issue, but the game doesn't run at 60fps. i'd recommend the game for the story, soundtrack, gameplay, graphics, but none of that matters until the game runs well.  edit: i just started getting crashes as well. change graphics settings, crash. cutscene ends, crash.  i really want to play this game, i enjoy it quite a bit but it seems like the game is doing everything it can to stop me from playing it.
12062	Story: 4/10 Starts really strong but then quickly turns generic and boring throughout the whole game. Even Vito offers nothing interesting.  Gameplay: 3/10 The missions are unfortunately VERY repetitive. There is no difference between the main missions and the optionals except for a very small number of unique and cinematic missions (like the steamboat or shooting up the KKK). The guns are fun, but the horrible stupid AI (who is just so willing to be killed by you) make both stealth and combat super easy. I only died a couple of times because of the stupid, not-computer-friendly controls and the cover system. You can just whistle to lure someone into your direction (they will go 1 at a time), kill him, repeat over and over again. The 7th guy won't be thinking 'hmmm what happened to my 6 buddies?'... Driving behaviour and physics are awful, but tbh I still had fun driving around. Altho there isn't much driving included in the missions (except for the optionial boring stuff), so wasted potential here. And for some absurd reason they got rid of features that were in the previous games, like buying/changing clothes (or stores in general), car physics (demolition, destruction), cops that don't shoot you on the smallest delict (plus I want to note that the whole state knows about you the very second one bloody cop spots you - no matter how quickly you take him out), and many more.  Graphics: 4/10 People complain alot about the overall graphics but for me it's more on the technical side: Graphics glitch out or don't load properly at times, especially when you drive fast. The lighting, which can be very awful and points and then be really great in other moments. And second, the skyboxes... they are just... really effin weird. There is also some really weird weather transitions at random points (not talking about quick transitions that are mission-related). The overall graphics like geometry and textures are totally fine to me and had some beautiful moments. Especially the cinematics and animations are really well done. It seems like performance-wise the game is alot more demanding than it should be for this quality.  Sound: 8/10 Weapons and vehicles sound good, soundtrack is great (obviously, c'mon you know the songs!) Tho, it's really annoying that your wheels are screaming the very second you hit the forward button.  Final words: This game does not deserve the title 'Mafia III' The game can be fun and I played through it because of the great soundtrack and atmosphere. But there is also alot of frustrating and boring moments. If you want to give this game a try, do it when it's on sale. Not worth the full price.
12063	Played 2 hrs of Mafia3, it doesn't seems to get any better because after the patch 1.01 my fps barely even 30 fps and my game was freezing when i was aiming or driving and crash at almost every single save point.   Story is good and all but the AI in game are just bunch of idiots walking around even i set it on hardest difficulty.  The view point + view distance was just more screwed up then i thought.  The Graphic all were so pixelated and without high textures at all, and i wonder why you even need high resolution setting when everything were almost the same as low resolution.  Conclusion: This game is a waste of time and money, i rather play a solid game with freezing and crashing, with great graphic and fps. Don't even buy this if you don't want to go though all this stupid issue they have before even publishing it.So i refunded it.
12064	This is far from even being beta
12065	First off, the lip sync in some of the cutscenes are so bad. Lag when you reach a high speed whilst driving or even when your normally driving. Missions sometimes glitch out, e.g. You go into a building but the character you are with doesn't follow you in there glitching out the mission which makes you have to either restart the game or the mission.  Don't buy it for it's current price.
12066	This is a bad console port of a rushed game.  - Repetitive gameplay. - Full of annoying bugs. - Frequently crashes to desktop. - Runs like â¥â¥â¥â¥ on the lowest settings. Even though I can run GTA V on ultra.  I can not recommend a game in this state. Maybe I would after several months of patches... 
12067	 Not recommended
12068	 Mafia III Review Final Result: 1,0/10 - Batman Arkham Knight all over again
12069	I'm a huge fan of Mafia II. Loved the story, gameplay and had tones of fun. Didnt bother me that open world aspect of the game wasn't as evolved and interesting as you can get in GTA.   This one is just far from OK. I have been waiting for this game since I saw trailer on youtube and what I received is a childlish version of some idea that could have been great. AI is just unbearable! What a shame and downfall of this great title.  Would't recommend and I feel I wasted my money!!!
12070	This game is unbelievably hit and miss...  The story and presentation are stunningly well done, it's a little generic but the delivery is impeccable. The shooting feels great and the setting has the potential to be gourgeous, that's the key word here, potential.  Pretty much everything feels almost solid, almost great, but not quite there yet. The city is beautiful but dead and plagued with graphical errors, glitchy citizens, awkward animations, a 20ft draw distance, the jankest weather cycle I think i've ever seen and so much more. The swamp is once again, beautiful but ruined by a terrible draw distance and odd glitches. The gun play is great, the AI is stupid. The melee combat is impactful, the animations are awkward and clunky. The visual design is stellar, it's ruined by a low framerate. Nothing is perfect and the only area where it truly excels is in the presentation of its story (The small amount of it that i have seen atleast).  Now aside from the big FPS problem and all the issues listed above the game is playable, very jumpy and annoying, but playable. The issues which make the game nearly unplayble for me are the filter, blur effects and glitches. The game has a p*ss filter which cannot be turned off, the filter is to make the game more 'thematic' as though you're viewing it through an old camera. This does make it feel somewhat more thematic due to the documentary style of delivery but honestly it isn't worth it, I'd rather just enjoy the period as it was. The blur is beyond frustrating if anything is more than 10 meters away it becomes incredibly blurry, text is unreadable, NPC faces become gelatinous blobs and gun fights are like a god damn earthquake. It feels as though the developers are trying their hardest to hide their lower res textures with obnoxious visual effects masquarading as 'style', it's just bad.  The glitches are a whole thing on their own, cars pop through the ground and glide through you until you die, NPC's fall over for no reason and fling through walls when ever so much as touched in a car, the police walk on water (not kidding), take downs don't connect and sometimes enemies will just stand still and shoot at nothing. It's ridiculous and the game even crashed to desktop twice during just two hours of play.  Potential is coursing through Mafia III's veins, but raging type 2 diabetes and concrete surfing soft tops make sure you never bloody see it.  I'm not giving a rating with just two hours of play, don't buy it until it's confirmed that these problems are fixed.
12071	Pre ordered from GMG so I can't get a refund (completly my fault) but if I could I would. I cannot play games at 30fps (unacceptable in 2016) so I waited patiently for the patch before playing unfortunately, the game is a mess even with the patch. I can't get 60fps, no SLI suport so one of my 980's is just sitting there chilling while the other is having a stroke struggling to run a s****y consol port with 512x512 textures at a steady 50fps (game fluctuates between 36 to 43fps). Lesson here is don't pre order kids.
12072	The game storyline is brilliant but there's other factors that made me don't recommend this game...  Pros: -Great storyline -Loved the combat system -Liked UI -Graphics are brilliant -Cutscenes are realistic  Cons: -Don't like the main character (No offense, I just don't think he should be the main character) -It doesn't look like it's optimised (Several freezes occurred during playing) -Volumetric lighting, reflection quality is too demanding... -Changing screen resolution can sometimes makes the game in boardless window. -Feels like GTA...  Overall, the game can be improved in terms of performance, some settings are demanding however but it shouldn't be a major issue if you and I don't have such a great PC. However, the game feels like it's GTA which actually put me off. I liked Mafia II, I prefer that over this game any day.  Score: 5.5/10
12073	We all know about the low 30FPS, which is being sorted as we speak.  3 or so hours into the game and here's my pros and cons.  Pros: - Great Storyline (So far) - Music is great, as always. - Cutscenes are fantastic, makes you feel part of the game.  Cons: - Obvioulsy the FPS, lags when driving in high detail areas. - Game can crash at certain times, has happened to me a few times. - AI are stupid, had to restart a mission due to one being stuck and unable to follow me. - Poor lighting when weather changes. I've had it that numerous times that when I'm driving on a sunny day, when all of a sudden it's dark and cloudy.  Will 're-review ' once the new patch has been released, but for now we'll have to either now play, or put up with the FPS and bugs,
12074	Well first off I'll say that I knew what I was getting into, just bought this due to huge boredom.  Story is ok so far, but the thing that probably annoys everyone playing Mafia 3 is that the missions are pretty much the same thing over and over again. You go in to a place and shoot everyone, then you interrogate the gang boss and either kill him or make him join your crew. Graphics are ok for the most part, but there are some really hideous textures like the whole damn sky, which looks like it's from ps2 game. Performance is ok after patches (100 ish with drops to 60s at max settings with 1070, i5 6600k @4.5ghz). If you for some reason want to play this game make sure to turn off vsync and put framerate to unlimited, locking the framerate will cause ridiculous stuttering and drops to 0 fps for no real reason. Wouldn't recommend getting it unless you just want to shoot people repetively, since I found the combat quite enjoyable.
12075	 Crash Simulator 2k16
12076	***FINAL REVIEW*** (This is my final review after completing the game's storyline. This review contains SPOILERS)   Mafia 3 had a lot of potential but unfortunetly failed to live up to expectations. The game's story is a typical revenge story that has the predictable 'I've become the monster I set out to destroy!' ending. The voice acting and motion capture for cutscenes are generally top notch, though occasionally there's a cutscene where the visuals look terrible and the acting feels awkward, especially with the priest and his future interviews. His fake crying is unbearable to sit through. I did enjoy getting some closure on the events of Mafia 2 concerning Vito Scarletta and Joe Barbaro, but they felt more like fan service rather than well thought out extensions of their story. I liked the mysterious way Mafia 2 ended, and the fact that they are suggesting that Joe survived kind of ruins the impactful ending of Mafia 2. So yeah, the story is decent and definitely the best reason to play Mafia 3, but it's nothing extraordinary.   The gameplay is where we start running into some serious problems. After a long 2-hour introduction where the timeline jumps around to help explain how the Mardi Gras heist went down, the game suddenly drops off into a highly repetitive crawl throughout the 'open-world' city. I put open world in quotations because the world is beyond empty. There's quite literally NOTHING to do in New Bordeoux aside from the side missions and main story missions. This would be fine if the side missions weren't required in order to unlock story missions. Each district in the city requires you to complete 8 repetitive side missions that pretty much always involve you invading an enemy controlled territory and killing a VIP inside. You can approach these missions with stealth or combat, but neither method makes a difference. There's no reward for playing the game stealthily so there doesn't seem to be a reason to bother most of the time aside from the thrill of sneaking around undetected. You can kill enemies lethally OR nonlethally, but for some reason, you must change a gameplay setting in the game's pause menu whenever you want to switch between these methods.   Once you complete a bunch of these side missions, you are forced to return to that district's friendly AI (where you are a treated to a lazy in-engine cutscene that looks like something out of an old Tony Hawk game) and they tell you to go to one of the side mission locations you JUST cleared to kill an underboss. After killing the underboss, you're only halfway done... now yuo need to meet another ally in the same district, complete 5-6 more side missions, and then kill another underboss to unlock an actual story mission. Now the story missions are a lot of fun most of the time. They are generally large set-pieces like a burning boxing ring or a crashed river boat where you fight your way to one of Sal Marcano's lieutenants. There's about 14 of these large missions and those alone would have made for a fun experience.. but unfortunetly you're stuck grinding away at this lackluster open world and completing side missions for 20 hours.   Thankfully the side missions can still be fun with the well done ingame economy. I never felt as though I had too much money to spend nor did I feel like mone was too hard to come back. I slowly managed to earn enough money to make upgrades to my arsenal, health, and vehicles. The melee kills are all awesome and never get old and combat often feels really realistic. The vehicle combat is pretty awkawrd, with strange lock-on targetting rather than freeaim and the cars seem to all handle pretty poorly, with vehicles often crashing into curbs and flipping over themselves.   Now that we're talking about bugs... let's talk about this game's technical aspects. They're terrible.. they're all terrible! This game crashed at least 10 times on my system, with an average framerate of about 55fps on the maximum graphic settings, and graphics that either look good, or look like GTA San Andreas. Often times when driving on long bridges, the game looks impossibly ugly. Other times, especially during the evening in the Bayou, the game looks beautiful. The game also causes my gtx 980ti's fans to get really loud, suggesting that the game is forcing my GPU to run way too hot.It's as if they stopped half-way through when making this game. I encountered several bugs that forced me to restart from checkpoint simply because friendly AI failed to perform scripts that allowed me to continue missions. I also had plenty of vehicles spawning ontop of eachother, AI acting strangely, visual glitches like clouds moving too quickly, and really strange massive saturation when inside buildings.   So if you're on the fence with your purcahse of Mafia 3.. let me help you. Don't buy it. Wait till it's $15 at most. This game is a disaster of a port and even without the technical issues, it feels unfinished with a lackluster game design and repetitive gameplay. It's a real shame beacuse I was really looking forward to this game, but I don't see myself replaying this one like I did with Mafia 2.   ________________________________________________________________________________ PC Performance Benchmark:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBSTG9fH04U&amp;list=PLTxgzJqWtkFZysGjlxeyWbwyJaJbMfWBJ&amp;index=1   Mafia 3 First Impressions Video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW3VdOZwGZE&amp;feature=youtu.be 
12077	Even with the patch and all graphics settings maxed out, this game still looks like something from 2009.  Also the K/B controls need some improving. There's no way to remap 'melee' to one of the extra buttons on my mouse and even the 'counter' button needs to be remapped better. The devs at Hangar 13 probably don't know that there are gaming mice out there that have more than just a left button, a right button, and a middle mouse button.  Okay... it's a day later and I found that I needed to increase the FOV for my 24' monitor from the default 60 to 78 and it improved the graphics. It's still not as pretty as GTA 5, but still better than when I first started playing. Also, I read somewhere someone's suggestion to lower the AA in the game and that seems to help as well. But, I did increase the AA in my NVIDIA control panel.
12078	SHORT REVIEW: Average Game not worth $80. Buy it only for $30-$40  LONG REVIEW:  So, after beating the game completely (with all side missions and stuff) I can say that this game is worth buying only on discount or rent. Throught out the whole game the best part to keep you coming back is only the story (WHICH IS DRAGGED AS HELL) and right after you beat it you just dont feel like playing it anymore at all. I just realise how much I had to force myself to play it until the end. The game might and probably will fascinate you at first like it did to me, but later on it just gets SO â¥â¥â¥â¥ING REPETETIVE to the point that you just sit in your chair bored as hell and trying to reach the end. The gameplay is very repetetive but the part that repeats itself (driving and combat) are made on a pretty good level which makes it possible to play this game. The story on the other hand in my opinion was pretty good but WAY WORSE than Mafia 2 story. From the beginning to the end you already know what is going to happen and its just simply disappointing. The ending isnt that great either they only made it a bit better by showing a little surprise and a throwback to the older games. In my opinion Vitos storyline in this game is better than the main one. So lets see the pros and cons of this game.  GAME SCORING: Combat 10/10 Driving 8/10 Open World (Alive but nothing to do) 5/10 Story 6.5/10 Vito's Story (Very Short Since It's A Side Story) 9/10 Level of Repetitevness (Try hitting a wall a thousand times and make yourself think that you are doing something new every time) 10/10 Cinematics 10/10 Graphics 7/10 Atmosphere 8/10 (Good atmosphere but just isnt that Mafia one that I wanted when getting this game) Soundtrack 9/10 (Just too short and gets repetetive often) Boss Levels 8/10 (Again good levels but are just too predictive and simple (even on the highest difficulty))  OVERALL SCORE: 6.5/10 This game is an average game that is not good nor is bad. Didn't find it that great to be honest and I alreadt know that I wont buy any DLC's or play this game again unless something really attracts my attention. Buy this game only if it's on discount, rent, pirate it, or just watch the cutscenes on YouTube (that's pretty much the good thing about the game).  Was very excited for the game and expected to get a masterpiece like the first titles but got an avarage game not worth $80 in my opinion. Same as with Battlefront from DICE.  EDIT: Not gonna lie after some time passed I do wanna play it again LOL only due to the combat. In my opinion it's very good and makes me wanna play it. But just like overwatch only for a little bit of time. In the future when they release more updates for the open world and who knows what, if they will turn out to be fun and make this open world an actual open world where you can do more than just shoot and drive, I'll change my opinion and will say that it's worth the money. Just like GTA this game will get better in the future but I ain't sure about that. They have the potential but didn't realise it yet I think...
12079	To day Lates Patch Finally Got a chance to play..   And found it somewhat laking in enjoyment      ///////////////////////////Original Comment///////////////////////////////////  Currently the game Is broken for a large number of people.  For me as soon game launches near instant crash to desktop.    Maybe I will update review IF/When game is FIXED.  -- Update even with the new patch game is still broke,   While not the biggest waste of my money in resent years. It was a definate mistake.
12080	As a fan of the 2 previous Mafia games, this one so far is a disappointment. 30fps locked (mumbles something about consoles) and random crashes. I expected the physics and the graphics to be better. They are ok, they don't seem to match the screenshots even after changing graphic settings, maybe I'm missing something but I doubt it.   The only good thing about it at the moment is the storyline. I can only hope they fix the major issues quickly or I will be requesting a refund.  Gone are the days where you can expect to pay top dollar for a game that isn't full of bugs on release. 
12081	  Bad stuff first.. Post 1.01 Patch still broken wait a month or so.
12082	If you're expecting the same level of gameplay depth as mafia 2. Run away. This game is a very dumbed down version of mafia. Signs are all over the place to show you with turn to take (no kidding) where doors are. Even picking a lock has been simplified. It's really an insult to our intelligence.  AAA games have been becoming more and more dumbed down throughout the years and this is a sad example of that. The game is still good, but it's really an insult we shouldn't just accept.  The graphics? The light effects look better, everything else looks weird. Objects close to you will sometimes be blurry (especially your own car), teeth of the characters look strange too. Overal, I'd say mafia 2 looks better (for now).  TL:DR if you never played mafia? Buy this, play this, then play mafia 2. If you've already played mafia 2. Stay away until you lower your expectations.
12083	Mafia 3 is still broken, 2 of my missions are broken, the sky in the game is broken..the morning sunrise, looks like hell on earth...... skies in free games are better than the sky in this game. DO NOT BUY until like 2018, maybe then after about 50 patches it'll work. BTW, It has had 2 paches, each 1.2gb each one.
12084	Let me start by saying, that I couldn't wait to play Mafia 3. The game has a really strong start plotwise, but then the side quests kick in... And after that all you do is:  1. Pick up a mission. 2. Go to a few places, where you kill a bunch of goons and interrogate their leader to get information. Now you are being offered a choice to either spare him and add some money to your racket, or kill him and earn some cash straight away. 3. Go to a another place, that is, again filled with goons - Kill them all. 4. When you have done enough damage to lure out the racket boss, you will have to kill him and his goons.  After you've done all of this, the main story continues a bit and you get to see a cutscene. Then repeat, repeat, repeat and repeat.   The controls for the keyboard + mouse takes a little time to get used to. AI is also pretty dumb. For example, when I was interrogating a guy, another goon just stood there pointing a gun at my head, and waited for me to finish the conversation before he would react.. And when I entered a vehicle with hostile goons in it, the guys at the backseat started shooting at the driver, who I'd just thrown out of the car. There's bugs here and there, but to some of those I just can't help but to laugh at.  Some positives though. The soundtrack is really kickass. When you fire up the game, you get to hear Jimi Hendrix + the game offers many hit songs from that era. Don't want to stop driving when I hear songs by Steppenwolf, Roy Orbison, Otis Redding etc.   I will continue to play this game, but I wouldn't recommend this to players who:  1. Don't like repetitive, grindy side missions. 2. Don't want to be forced to complete side missions in order to continue the main story.  That's my 2 cents folks!
12085	NOT WORTH THE FULL PURCHASE PRICE  i wouldnt suggest buying this unless it was on sale for at least 50% off.    . blurry textures, very low res textures on many things, locked at 30 fps at launch . Shows how out of touch this developer really is with PC community. Game looks like vaseline was smeared on the screen before you played.    lazy design on the NPC's. cleared a room of 'workers' in a heroin den. EVERY DAMN ONE OF THEM WAS THE SAME NPC.. the npcs you look at look like they are rendered at 240p.  Im going to play the game because i cant get a refund from GMG .   story seems ok.. but right now that all i can say good about it
12086	This game is, wait for it! ... -   FPS:  You all know that it's locked at 30 fps by now, and that they are going to release a patch for it. Sure, I'll take that. But why did they even release it to begin with, with a 30 fps lock.. It's so idiotic.  Graphic: I immediately felt kinda 'dizzy' once I started driving a vehicle in the very begning of the game, even though I had motion blur off. My eyes kinda hurt, an absolute turn off for what is suppost to be a beautiful game. Then, if you take an actual look around the surrounding, you will notice how bad everything truely is. The vehicles just a few feet in front of you won't show any details what so ever until you even get remotely close to it. When you turn around, facing your own character.. - You can't even see ANY details WHAT SO EVER in his face, and I swear, theres even some blur ON HIS FU*#&amp;NG FACE!!   Story: Don't know, kinda rage quit and refunded game. I bought the game for the story though, but the overall game is just to bad, can't bother continuing.   ... - Absolute trash! This game is absolute trash!  Thank you, shoutout to my mum &amp; dad.
12087	I have lost 53 hours of progress after a random crash corrupted the one and only autosave. A truly flawless design and implementation. It may sound frustrating, but I was already planning to abandon the game. I have a high tolerance for repetitive gameplay, but the last 10 hours were a real drag. Being a completionist I have collected and completed everything throughout the game. Do not make the same mistake! Do only what's absolutely necessary, backup your save manually and maybe you will reach the ending with a happy smile.
12088	Very very disappointed with how this game turned out, story is shiiiit. This game is disgrace to the Mafia series
12089	  game is playable but its still a mess in itself... its not a arkham mess but pretty close. controller (XboxOne Wireless) commands do not show for me and some are not even assigned like the CLOSE command when those damn tutorial messages pop up. playin with mouse and keyboard without problems. 12 crashes in 10 hours of gameplay. at some times it looks worse than gta5 on a ps3 or xbox360. no steam cloud save support. i do not recommend this game in this state.
12090	Review in Progress [Don't Buy, REFUNDED THE GAME]  [Updated 4:03 PM 7/10/2016]: Game Crashed after a cutscene  [Updated 7:03 PM 7/10./2016]: Shooting mechanics are fun, Water effects are outdated. [Updated 12:04 AM 8/10/2016]:   -Adjusting Menu Graphics setting doesn't affect ingame graphics setting. You have to manually adjust the setting again inside the Game in Display option.  - Turned off Vsync (Still locked to 30FPS) - Setting AA to low will reduce the blurrines of textures. Image seemed much sharper - Gemoetric and Lighting seems to have huge hit on FPS when set to High. Reduced my FPS from 30 to 15 on High. - Day One update still haven't arrived.   [UPDATE 10:46 AM 9/10/2016]: PATCH 1.01 is RELEASED which has unlocked FPS and keyboard binding fixes but thats just it!. No other visual improvements or anything.   Time Played: 67min  NOW:   Pros:   1. Gameplay is fun and engaging 2. Vehicle Handling is good 3. Combat System seems to be solid 5. 30 FPS won't have a huge affect on gameplay 6. Cutscenes and Loadtimes are good [running the game from SSD]  Cons:  1. There is a 30 FPS Lock 2. Textures are blurry 3. Menu UI is sluggish and looks outdated 4. World MAP and Player HUD graphics looks outdated 5. NO SLI Support  6.Game crashed after a cutscene  7. Looks like a Console Port 8. Water Effects are outdated  9. Film grain effect?   Graphics Setting: 1. Custom, All high except Geometric,Lightning and AA on LOW   System: 1. Core i7 4700MQ 2. 16GB DDR3 RAM 3. nVidia Geforce 780m SLI DUAL 4. Samsung SSD 840 EVO 5. Windows 8.1 64BIT  6. Using Latest Nvidia Geforce Game Ready Driver for Mafia 373.06   A patch for PC seems to be coming very soon which will fix the 30 FPS Lock and give options of 60 FPS and above. Other perfomance updates are coming soon. I will update this review after the first day one Patch!. Wait for the patch and see how it improves for others then buy the game.
12091	i am going to keep it short the story(cutscenes),music and voice acting are good. gameplay is repetitive you keep doing the same thing over the 9 districs you have to take over, the world feels very empty no customization for cars,clothing and buildings the ingame money you earn feels like it has no use then buying weapons wich you don't do most of the time weapons they all feel the same all you do is headshot with any weapon to insta kill   i would skip this game i am sure there are better games for 50-60 bucks
12092	Honestly, i can't recommend this game, here's why:   1) It looks not very good, it's low on detail, the districts are very short of people, towns don't look 'Alive' and i was honestly expecting it to look about as alive as atleast mafia 2.   2) It looks like it was made in unity and honestly i expected more here too, it is a AAA game that cost millions of dollars to create. I hope maybe a patch can fix this? maybe not, we'll see.  3) The game is choppy, and i mean very choppy. It has nothing to do with the 30 FPS because honestly i don't mind. But if i can run GTA V on highest settings, i expect to run this game without lag and 'choppiness'. It ruins the experience.  4) It plays weirdly, the controls are unresponsive, making for a worse experience.  5) The current amount of glitches in the game. If you stand on the roof of a car, your legs will literally stand on the seats. He won't even stand on the roof, but it seems that certain parts of the cars are 'not there' and you can go straight through them.  6) (This is a minor non game breaking one) The talking to people cutscenes that aren't real cutscenes so they can't be skipped, are so annoying. You stand there talking like it was a cutscene, but you can't skip them. They bring nothing to the story, and its an unnecessary evil  In it's current state, i cannot recommend it, i've loved mafia since the first time i played mafia 2, and this game honestly is not worth it, not in it's current state, there is a patch coming, and i hope to update this to a good review when it's out, but for now heed my warning. Have a nice day ^~^
12093	Not telling audience about the 30fps cap was shady enough.  But now it makes sense the reason that the game was initially capped to 30fps was that the game was horribly optimised. Running a 980 sli + 4930k and the game can't hit 60 outside or in.   If the framerate had been good I could have forgived the rubbish graphics which make gta V look like a new crysis, or the generic mafia plot e.g. guys mess with you, build up and empire, slowly pick them off, have a couple crises of morality, kill main bad dude, family avenged.  For PC gaming to be a good overall experience for the Â£1500+ we spend on our rigs we have to shed the developers that cant be bothered making a good PC port because the guys with the spreadsheets think we'll buy anything Hello games was a recent example and now its Hanger 13.
12094	The graphics are dissapointing. Could've added First Person Driving View so that the rear view mirror function doesn't seem redundant. Like how the driving works when changed the settings to 'simulator'.  Played 2 hrs into the story, didn't get me hooked or excited unlike the first 2 series (I'll try to finish the story, but as of my first 2hrs, I don't feel any hype in the story as compared to it's predecessor). Mafia Games are supposed to have the most punch in their story!   In short, Mafia III gave you alot of content to play with at the cost of a cinematic story experience. Mafia 2's story and cinematics were so great! Can't believe they killed it with Mafia III. =(  Mafia 2 had content quality. Mafia 3 gave content quantity.  Waited for months for this, bought the physical collector's edition. I must say it's quite dissapointing. Recommend others to wait for content/graphics updates from 2K before buying.
12095	Just beaten the game...  Well, as a Mafia game it is pretty average.  They should fire their mission designer, also the one came up with the 'It's a good idea to make this game looks like some stupid console port so let's make it 30fps lock' guy.  First, let's talk about 30fps, they DID say that there will be a patch allowing you to go 60, but why in the world would anyone think it's a good idea to NOT have 60 on launch, same goes for changing cloth, as it should be a LATER free update... Is this game half finished?  The mission is lengthy, repetitive and unbearable, you want to do a progress a story quest? Sure, do ALL the regional quest( as in, kill somebody, destory something kind of quest with zero plot involved) first, then you get your story quest. I believe this bs is used to make their the game lengthy, but it feels like some â¥â¥â¥â¥ing grindy korean mmo to me. Once I'm done with the main story line, there's literally nothing left for me to do... 19 hours. Pfft.  The whistle key is 'Delete', I have no idea who designed this, they really didn't put any effort on this....  Just don't buy it...
12096	While this is a good game in gameplay and story terms, I cannot give it a positive rating as I won't support their development process/model.  30 fps. 4k UI scaling is terrible. hardly readable. Gameplay so far is good.. But for a 2016 game and AAA, it should have unlocked FPS and alterable UI scaling or at least a better one than this.
12097	8 crashes in 2 hours.  EDIT: MSI Afterburner / Rivatuner seems to be what caused the crashes. If you use Afterburner, be sure to disable the in-game overlay.
12098	Well, I bought the game because I was excited for the next game in the Mafia lineup, but only untill the day before it was released did I know it was gonna be locked at 30 frames. Then 2K somehow got all the major game magazines and websites to not write a review untill the actual release date, so no one had no way of knowing the game was gonna be locked at 30 frames because they thought no one would pay 60 bucks for it that way. I know I wouldn't. They already released a patch to fix that, but it still doesn't run at 60 frames. A few other guys plus myself still can only get the game to run at 40, at most, so theres that. I'm mostly confused as to why 2K would develop a game on a computer, like all videogames, then not opitmize it for PC. Plot goes something like 'You're not actually in the Italian Mafia, but you fight them.' Great way to ruin the trilogy. People ahve been complaining that the main character is black. I don't have a problem with a minority main character, but like I said, I am dissapointed that the player isn't actually in the mafia. So. Here's where we stand. I got a triple-A title, for 60 bucks, that wasn't even opitimzed for PC, without any way of nowing it, thats so far unplayable, has nothing to do with either of the former games all relased by a developer who cares nothing for the PC community. But hey, at least I got called the N-word within the first 5 minutes of gameplay, y'know, right before the game crashed. Moving on. Cops are worse than in GTA 5. For whatever reason, the cops shoot on sight, regardless on whether or not I've comitted a crime. I'll just be driving down the road, a cop'll yell something like 'hey, stop right there!' and just start shooting. Cops have unlimited ammo, but when they die, they don't drop any guns or ammo. Speaking of which, cops don't make arrests. Accidently crashed into a light pole? Too bad. Dead. When you die, you loose exactly half your cash, any ammo you used in the gunfight and you get respawned wherever 2K pleases. Very poorly thought out game. 0/10. 2nd worst game of all time, next to No Man's Sky.  Update: This game keeps crashing and my PC keeps overheating. I run a GTX 980 TI and a 3.6 GHz processor. This shouldn't be happening. Serious optimization issues here.  Update: Game just crashed for the 6th time in less than 20 hrs of gameplay.
12099	Mafia III a game about a group of criminals (AAA Developers) in a organized mafia. Its goal is make PC video games â¥â¥â¥â¥ and unoptimized while making console versions better, thus monopolizing video games to be sold to consoles. Which means, more people jump on the console market, people buy the games for console = $$$
12100	Cons: - Can't rebind keys to extra mouse buttons - Muddy and Blurry textures (looks like console textures)  - Locked at 30 FPS - 3 crashes to desktop in less than 1 hour of play.  Pros: - Story is great - Music    2k Announced a patch that should come in this weekends, until then i will recommend to wait with purchasing this game.  Update#1 : Fps cap removed , the game is way better now. Games still crashes a lot (4 crashes in 20 min!!!) textures are blurry and all same issues remain.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZokdmzvDGA  Not going to change my review because i don't support Devs for this on fly fixes and the bad import they made to PC.
12101	'Me Too': This is obviously the motto the Game designers went for when making this game, It has the Shallow 'Do this, than to the same thing again, all over the map'-Syndrom from a Ubisoft Sandbox, the unnecessary Hitman X-Ray vision and the Terrible interface from GTA V seemingly just because it tries to fit in with them, and fails.   It blaitantly ignores established Mafia canon (mentioning Chicago, the city that Lost Haven was supposed to be replacing in Mafia 1, it renames cars aswell as guns for no reason) but the biggest offender is the missing features for me, You can't customise your outfit so you are stuck with the Military brown Rubbish Bag Jacket and you can't customise cars and with that saving them has fallen out of need as well.  (Note that they have released a patch to adress the outfit Problem but it still is simply too late for anyone to care)  The entire game evokes the fat kid trying to befriend the Cool kids in school and doesn't succeed with that or with it's grades, and as it's english teacher in this metaphor I give the story it tries to tell a D- with none of the characters getting any depth and no character dynamics being conveight, it smacks you about with time jumps and flashbacks that are simply more irritating than a story told straight forward which also smacks of just doing this because the game saw it in Hollywood movies rather than because it helps the story in any way and it ends up a mess.  Towards the begining... excuse me, Twords thah beginin' liddle Boahi Mafjah 3 do has the noshion of naht carin and juhst wanting you get to do the gauhd damn clearin out missions, which carreh no weight what so evehr. You would get the same feeling just colouring a map with crayons and punching yourself in the face every time you want to continue.   Every feature that added a bit of realism and lighted up the commute to a new mission from Mafia 2 like lockpicking your way into a car of choice,having to get fuel for it, being able to make it dirty, wash it and giving it new rims and new paint, drive it to a restaurant and have a sandwich is gone which odd to take out because no one has ever complained about it (and if it's not broke, carry it over to the sequel) but it adds to my suspicion about the developers ('Hangar 13' instead of 2K Chech this time) trying to be a Ubisoft sandbox which in my opinion is the like being the much more boring and limited Playmobil instead of the free ,careless and infinitely customisable Lego of the GTA series.   And besides AssCreed really has been an â¥â¥â¥ in recent installments,in case you haven't noticed.  It doesn't feel like it's own thing, taking aspects from other games to use without caring that it is all a mess in the end.  Plus it certainly doesn't offer a satisfying sandbox experience like other before mentioned Crime-focused Car-driving sandboxes do, with none of the customisation and none of the fun and instead of that trying to convince you that filing Disticts under names all day liken a magical politics fairy is fun.  But if you like a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ story, string of unfunny clichÃ©s about the 1960s,racism and Dah Saouth and like to hear Born to be wild 5 times, Fortunate Son 3 times as well as that song about thing being painted black four times in the first two hours (no joke, I counted) then the game is for you, moron.
12102	Wish it would play on my PC, start screen loads click start attempts to start game then drops it and goes back to the desktop. Now I discover it doesn't play on PC's with AMD CPUs, and there is no patch so it can! Who in their right mind releases a game for PCs that doesn't play on half the worlds PCs!  Quote from  windowsreport.com  'Also, gamers confirmed that Mafia III doesnât work on AMD CPUs without SSE 4.1 support. The game crashes at desktop, just like MGS V and No Mans Sky. Taking into account their previous experience, gamers are now waiting for devs to roll out a patch so that they can play Mafia III on Phenom CPUs.'
12103	I mean, come on. 30 fps?  Update: first crash within less than 20 minutes of play. Let's see if it gets worse.  Update 2: I've had five crashes in my 40 minutes of play, I'll stop playing the game until a patch comes out. Although I really enjoy the tone and the general direction the game seems to be going, I cannot reconmmend the game at its current state.  Update 3: The dev came out and confirms that they knowingly launched the game with the 30 cap, for reasons I can only infer from their statements were due to consoles' limitations. To me, that is no excuse. They say that they know 'how important having options...and frames [are]', blah blah blah. It's not like they just announced PC version yesterday. If the dev made a mess, I'll call it what it is.   P.S. for people whose arguments are: 'The game isn't even out in most countries', therefore the game is somehow not launched and the problems that I'm presenting are somehow invalidated? No. If it is launched in even just one country, then it is launched. If the game is broken in one country, the game is broken, and it shall be rightfully criticized by the customers of that region.  (Running on I7-5930k and a 980ti)
12104	Pro's  - Great, solid and well written story - Can be played at max grahics at 1440p with a GTX 980  Con's  - AI is dumber than a bag of hammers - AI repeats the exact same catch-phrases over and over and over and over........ - 30 FPS lock (holy cr*p WHY?!?!) - Some graphical glitches (should be easily patched) - Texture pop-in is not a problem while on foot - catastrophic when driving at speed - If you want to sneak properly - you will NEED a controller  I would give this game 10/10 if not for the fps cap and glitches and brain dead AI   Worth buying if on sale, NOT worth it in its current state at full price.
12105	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Pc graphics and Keyboard+Mouse Support  Runs like a potato~ Can't even rebind keys to more than the defult mouse buttons Short and simple~ Great game but â¥â¥â¥â¥ YOU for making this a console only trash game... Arkam Knight Everybody... Again
12106	EDIT: The game has now been updated to include the new framerate options. It definitely plays much better although it still needs optimizations but considering how fast they pushed out the fps update I have no doubt optimizations will be coming soon. When playing with the 60 or unlimited framerate options I recommend using vsync as the screen tearing at this point in time can be pretty bad. I'll continue to update my review as I play and hopefully I can work towards a recommendation once I play more.  Let's get the obvious out of the way. Yes the game is locked to 30fps but the developer has said they will be releasing an update with 30, 60, and unlocked fps options. They still don't get a free pass on launching it this way but at least they're not ignoring our complaints to fix it as fast as possible. With that being said, the only other major complaint I have with the visuals is that the game seems to be rendered at a much lower resolution than what you choose to natively display it as. I can't prove this fact but with how incredibly blurry the game is, even at higher resolutions (4k) It seems to be this way and I don't know if this can be improved or not.  Lack of visual options for user adjustment is a downside as everything ranges from low-high instead of giving us PC gamers what we are generally used to in terms of visual options. I should suggest that while other people have experienced crashes on a much higher scale, I have only crashed once so far so I have been lucky it seems.  On to the good stuff: -the game has a superb atmosphere that really captures the heart of the time the game takes place. And not just visually but the way people interact with you, cops always being supicious of you/etc really adds to the realism of the time. -music is awesome just as it was in Mafia II adding to the atmosphere once again -storytelling seems to be well thought out with great performances thus far as well as characters that are generally interesting -gunplay is solid although I do recommend turning off aim assist for the best experience -audio design outside of the soundtrack is great as well  General comments/personal preferences: -the driving is best when switched to simulation mode but it's still far from perfect. I don't mind it as much but you may hate the inconsistency of it -Ai needs some work. Open world games usually lack Ai that is well programmed or unique, this is no different, can be bad at times but don't let it detract from the overall story -play with a controller, your life will be much easier -collectibles are back! (Playboys :D, and others)   At its current state I would suggest most people wait until the game is fully patched up and fixes the major issues mentioned above, but for anyone who is either a fan of the series or isn't bothered by the 30fps cap that is currently enforced, pick it up but be aware you still and probably will run into issues.
12107	The launcher is nice, but once you want to see what you spent money on, the game stops working. Will give an update when I actually see the main menu.
12108	Pretty much GTA. For example.......  ***MAFIA 1*** 1) You speed past the cops, they pull you over and give you a ticket. 2) You run somebody over, you get arrested. 3) You bump into a car, you live to tell the tale.  ***MAFIA 3*** 1) You speed past the cops, you get shot. 2) You run somebody over, you get shot.  3) You bump into a car, you get shot.  What on earth happened to depth in games.... 
12109	terrible optimization. I put everything on low and still lag. I have i5-3470 3.20 ghz 8 gb GPU nvidia gtx 650 TI and on the minimum salary schedule similar to mafia 2 which I played at top speed! give optimization! I only have one question will you reduce the lag! or I bought the game for nothing and I will have to change software!
12110	My Review was Positive for 32.1 Hours of Playtime in Mafia 3. It had 88% Positive Feedback and i will re-post my old review when the main aspect of my negative Review is being fixed.  Look at the Discussion:    http://steamcommunity.com/app/360430/discussions/0/341537671995256038/   and    http://steamcommunity.com/app/360430/discussions/0/343788552553810086/    After you killed the 'Big Boss' and can choose between Vito, Burke or Cassandra to give a district, there is one Mission where you cant progress. After the Mission: 'Burn Like Napalm' which is quite lately at the end of the game you can choose to give one district to one of your crew. The Window doesnt pop up and you are stuck watching at Vito without making any progress.    Be aware that some people can make progress and finish the game but some people can't. Some People can't even start the Game. FIXES?
12111	Worst game optimisation in my life. THIS GAME NEEDS MORE ATTENTION the devs left it in the dust tho so dont expect many more optimisation fixes, i wished i had refunded this game ealier.
12112	I was used to love mafia. When it had good story. Not any problems with FPS. No problem with sky/weather.  This is just..sad :c  I like mafia 3 , i dont hate it , but i expected alot more.  But i must say voice acting and cut scenes are perfect , love those.
12113	Refunding I will buy this game again only after its patched more than once and not having errors game crashed to desktop during cutscene no error message or anything really wanted to like this game I purchased the digital deluxe edition so I hope developer can fix it soon.  Mafia 2 Vs Mafia 3 comparison video   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHjeDvnSPPA#t=261.323605 
12114	TL;DR Should you buy this? No. Not yet.  Although the trailers made me feel like this was going to be some generic 'you're a badass, work your way towards it' game, the story is actually compelling and the characters are very interesting. Sadly though, that's the only reason to get this game so far.  It's like mafia 2, only worse. Graphically it's all drab and dark, there's no color or ambience like in Mafia 2, although it has some appeal for itself. Right now just expect minecraft graphics and you might be pleased with what you get; they downgraded the graphics and tried to compensate for it by spamming post processing effects.  You'll see out of place textures, effectes and objects that make the whole thing not feel like 1 world, but more like a world with objects in it placed by the dev.  Also it's worth noticing that the day and night cycle will appear in 2 seconds, literally. You'll see the sun flying past you on the ground and at least a second later it'll all go dark for nighttime, it's just broken.  I've even had one occasion where it all went pitch black and eventually gained more and more brightness after 5 seconds of waiting, probably also an issue with the day/night cycle.  All in all this is a terrible port, they even had the balls to release it at a 30fps cap, which as now been removed. Sadly though, it's VERY noticable that the rest of the game hasn't been adjusted accordingly. You'll get a very poor framerate at a high end PC, resulting in something that looks WORSE than mafia 2.  How, you ask? Mafia 2 is outdated by now, this is a AAA next gen game. Well it's not any more impressive than Mafia 2 graphically. It's very clear when playing this that this was intended for consoles exclusively; textures are very drawn out and blurrish and one look at the skybox will reveal that it's a stretched out JPEG with no effort in it.  Heck, just look up some footage of a mirror in this game. It's a picture in picture screen with a 10 second delay. In english; this means if you look in a mirror after walking at it, you'll see yourself about 10 seconds ago. Wait for another 10 seconds and it might load the picture of you standing closer.    Game is full of bugs, and i do mean full. As an ArmA fanboy and Early access tester i've never shyed away from bugs, even on a AAA title.  However in this game you'll see at least 50 of them within 30 minutes of playing. Dead enemies will ragdoll into walls and objects around you, melee kill animations will clip you, your opponent and your camera through walls and objects alike. Cars will teleport in front of you as a result of the console's intended view distance. My personal tip; never drive at full speed. A car will eventually spawn 1cm in front of you standing still and you'll have a deadly crash.   The AI is horrendous. I'm not sure how scripted the AI in mafia 2 was, but it definitely seemed better than here. You can basically 'sneak' at your enemy, AKA crouch-run at your enemy. If you react within 5 seconds of him seeing you, you can still press control to slide lincoln into cover at the enemy's feet. He'll then be like 'what's that sound' instead of 'why is there a huge â¥â¥â¥ african-american war hero sliding past me', and as a result you can easily press Q to kill him.  As for the cops; they're on the 'broken AI' bandwagon. You can drift diagonally across 4 lanes at an intersection with 2 patrol cars and 4 officers on foot watching you, you'll get a blue marker indicating they're 'about' to get alerted, but they won't. They won't chase you if you speed, they won't chase you if you cut them off in incoming traffic, they won't chase you if you drift like a maniac.  They will, however, immediately pull their weapons and start firing at you if you slightly hit something. The good old bribing and them attempting to arrest you at first is history. It's mafia 3; it's dumbed down, so don't expect any details like the ones you got in mafia 2.  Stealth is no challenge whatsoever, i'm challenging myself to do the entire playthrough guns blazing, although i'm generally a massive fan of stealth gameplay.   Gameplay and graphics wise it feels like a letdown from mafia 2.  Storywise and characterwise however; it's definitely worth it. That is if the game gets fixed or deserted and discounted down to 20 bucks. Don't pick it up for any higher price for now.
12115	How the F do releases like this keep getting put out over and over again where there are horrid issues to begin with? I'm very much looking forward playing this when it gets fixed but right now there is no way I can play it when the graphics are so muddy. My vision is bad enough I'm not going to slog through this mess. They even muddied up the Steam overlay. HOW? Perhaps I'll change my review when it is fixed and can 'see' what an awesome game it is, perhaps not because really junk like this needs to be punished.  Edit 10/29/2016: After 3 weeks and 50+ hours of play I do like the gameplay but the poor performance and graphics persist. The promised patch was released quickly but didn't seem to improve a single thing. I can max out graphics or set them to low and get exactly the same poor performance and muddy graphics. Even the audio quality is poor with popping and to make it even half way reasonable sounding you have to lower the quality of your entire PC's audio to minimal. To add to the problems is a very confusing mission progression system where you have missions available but they're not really available because you haven't done something in the game yet which would actually allow that mission to be played. For example, you might have a mission to steal a truck or boat or whatever and you spend lots of time getting to that objective only to find out it isn't there because there is something else you need to do first and the game does little to nothing in explaining how this works. So you spend lots of time driving around to play missions that can't be played. I'll keep powering through the game but had I been in a refund situation to begin with I never would have kept it. I do love this franchise and hope they get their stuff fixed.
12116	EDIT: I decided to refund this, but I will leave the original review at the bottom. I can't pay for this and I feel bad for the developers because I don't think any of them wanted to release this game as unfinished as it currently is. Characters, animations and especially the facial animation are really high quality. Soundtrack and sound design is awesome. Storytelling is great and story itself seems really good. Everything points out that they were making an awesome high quality game, but there are a lot of things that seem to be unfinished or need some polish. Physics are wonky and don't work correctly. Lighting has issues and there is flickering and weird reflections. Textures are really low quality by todays standard. AI is dumb, game is full of glitches and is crashing from time to time. 30fps is not acceptable but the limit is not my biggest issue with the game and I don't believe that all of the issues are going to be fixed in future patches. Locking fps to 30 also hints that the optimization is also only half done. I am disappointed.   ---ORIGINAL REVIEW---  After quick testing I can throw in a few pros and cons:   PROS  - Story seems good. - Characters and character/facial animations are well made. - Soundtrack is amazing!! - Driving is pretty good when set to simulation. - Cutscenes, overall feel and also the collectibles!   CONS  - Locked to 30fps which is NOT enough for a pleasant experience. - Way too much handholding: Button prompts and floating markers everywhere and I found no option to turn those off. Collectibles are marked on the minimap and even highlighted with an icon when nearby. - Low res textures here and there and very low res reflections on vehicles. Chrome on the bumpers/trims especially looks horrible! Car models are not that high quality and seem to have weird reflections. - Traffic pop-in at distance. - Graphics generally are not that great excluding the characters. There is a blurry feel overall even when the Depth of Field, Motion Blur and Anti-Aliasing are turned off. - Sun/clouds are working weird. When driving around everything will suddenly go dark and then bright again. Ofcourse this is how it works irl when clouds cover the sun but the effect ingame is way too fast. - Guns seemed to be frustratingly inaccurate when shooting medium to high range, even if you shoot one round at the time. I only had little time with guns so this was really the first impression.   VERDICT  I want to like this game. I am a huge fan of the previous games, but the more I play this one the more disappointed I get. Story and characters seem ok, but everything else feels like its half complete. I can't really enjoy the game with framerate locked to 30 and it makes some of the cons seem worse, but that is not the only problem with this. I 'hope' that this was just released too early and future patches will fix all the graphical issues and not only remove the framerate lock. I will revisit this review if I get a reason to do so, but it's not looking very good...
12117	Review in progress - game on hold until patch(es)...  So far:  The story itself looks exciting - I really like the documentary style, the characters and the atmosphere is promising. But this game suffers from major issues.  The 30 FPS lock will be the least of our problems (never should have been there in the first place), the graphics doesn't look as good as it should be, low quality textures everywhere. There is also a constant blurriness which spoils the look of the game even further. Suffers from lots of minor (but annoying) bugs, full of glitches and other issues (regarding both graphics and gameplay).   The AI is stupid, sorry there isn't any, this 'openworld' gameplay must be a joke in 2016. Watch_Dogs seems like GTA6 compared to this game.  All of the problems mentioned above could have been avoided if they take some extra time to polish the game and delay it for a couple of months.  Will update the review when I finish the game, until then I can't recommend it.
12118	I just nominated this mess for The 'Biggest Disappointment' Award.   2K Czech made the Mafia series great, Hangar 13 took everything great about it and threw it out the window.  I had really high expectations for Mafia III, and to call it a disappointment is an understatement.  I feel that they took too much inspiration from other titles and kept too little of what the first games in the series great. I'm not saying everything they added is bad, some of it is great, but some of it is terrible and executed even worse.   Gameplay:  They showed us a badass trailer but nothing that happened in the trailer happened in game. In the trailer it looks like you will have the gang with you causing mayhem in the city of New Bordeaux, but in the game they actually just sit on their â¥â¥â¥ the whole time while you do all the heavy lifting. The game want's you to believe you're in charge of your 3 underbosses, but in reality you're running around doing everything for them.  Shooting in the game is decent enough but with only 2 weapons, it feels like they really want you to go stealth. Stealth is almost too easy, you can just whistle and knock people out all day.  Some UI elements feel very unnecessary, signs popping up along the road telling you the direction to drive, and sings hovering over weapons saying there is a weapon on the ground.  The sandbox elements in the game are rather pointless. Many buildings to break into is a cool idea, but when every building looks exactly the same inside it becomes boring pretty quickly. You can also break into junction boxes and wiretap them, so you can see all enemies in the area trough walls and all collectible items on the map.  There is a few different types of stores around the city, liquor stores, diners and such. But they have no purpose other than for you to steal money from, no clothing stores and no garages to modify your car. And since this is the future and you don't need gasoline, gas stations are only there to explode even if you didn't crash into anything. There's also no garage for you to store your favorite cars in like Mafia 2, now you call with your cellphone no I mean radio of course, and someone will deliver a car to you.  Driving in this game is so weird it almost feels like the car isn't moving, just the ground and camera. There is almost no difference what speed you have if you crash, even at low speed the screen gets red like you're about to die, but don't take any damage. Trying to drive from the road up to the pavement is not always an easy task, sometimes it goes smoothly, but sometimes it's like hitting a wall. The cars doesn't really get that banged up either, just a few dents and broken lights, but all of a sudden the engine explodes.  The AI is so stupid it's hard not to laugh at them, and even your allies will drive you down.   Controls:  No jumping is okay, but the movements of the character is so limited and you can't walk up or climb over so many of the obstacles.  I have still not done many brutal takedowns, because I just can't figure out how to do them.   Graphics:  First of, Mafia 2 came out 6 years ago and I don't see not much improvement in graphics. The lighting looks really great at times, but suddenly it is bugged and looks horrible.  Mafia was originally released only on PC. Here we have yet another poorly optimized port, but it has so many issues beside that. The 30 fps cap was nothing compared to how aged this game feels even though it came out just a few days ago. I also feel like the graphics options in this game is very limited. Just look at how Rockstar worked on optimizing GTA V for PC before they released it. It has a long list of options and it runs smoothly on older computers and looks way better than Mafia III.   Sound:   The sound is all over the place and I hear tire squealing shifting from ear to ear all the time, and sometimes in firefights it sounds like people shooting and screaming on the left, when there is nobody there. It might be a little less noticeable with speakers but with headphones it's really distracting  The soundtrack is superb. So many good tracks to drive around to.   Story:  The story is told in a documentary style and reminds me of the first Mafia. I just wish we got to know some characters more, I'm supposed to avenge some people I barly know.  The story is a bit short and I feel like I did the same thing over and over again in the side missions and the story missions were over way too fast.  I really like the setting and the feel of 1968 New Bordeaux, I just feel they put too much technology and science fiction in it.   Bugs:  The game is full of bugs and glitches: floating items, sinking cars, AI running in circles, AI driving in circles, double render of Cassandra. And many many more.
12119	So if you played Mafia 1 and 2 this will be extremely disappointing. This doesn't offer even close to the same experience as far as being a mobster, in fact you play a character taking apart a mafia in Louisiana. If there is one place that doesn't remind me of the Italian Mafia, it's Louisiana... They start the game with a disclaimer stating that they don't agree with racism which tells me that the vast majority if not all of people making the game are white and have little to no experience with actual people of other races and possibly even white southerners. I can safely say that every black person I know would have offered the feedback to the rest of the team saying, don't put that in there it makes you sound stupid. I could go on about that but it's not even close to the worst part of the game. They basically just made a Grand Theft Auto San Andreas clone based in the 60s/70s, this isn't Mafia, this is GTA. There isn't any class to it, there isn't anything remotely Italian to it. They take the main character from Mafia II and make him an ancillary throw away character who really could have been anybody. There is almost no character development in the story save for exposition by third parties in cut scenes that really aren't necessary and quite honestly become annoying as hell after the first few times they happen, but never end.   You know what I'm not going to put any more effort into this review than they did in making the game. So short answer, don't buy it unless it's on sale.
12120	I know there is gonna be a patch soon. But for now it looks like its a smartphone game
12121	If you try to find Mafia game here - it's a bad place for it. This is not Mafia, this is Mobgang squad game. Remind me PayDay. Too bad, the Mafia is dead. Graphics look â¥â¥â¥â¥. For real? 2017 coming soon! What a â¥â¥â¥â¥? + Additional to this: 30 FPS lock, crash after 40 min gameplay, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ subtitles. 2/10 Not coast they price. Refunded.
12122	I can't even get the game running,
12123	From my point of view - it's a shame the entire series.   The game does not match the previously stated quality. During the game you start to realize that it was made in 2005, by indie developers in a basement which is located in the suburbs of Pyongyang  Mafia 3 is a hoax and an attempt to steal from fans of the series as much money as possible for a pacifier.  This game doesn't deserve to be the heir of a series of games Mafia.
12124	I do not recomand the game,is just feel unfinished,unpolished.Apart from the 30 FPS lock the textures look blurry and one of the biggest problem for me is the lighting system beeing to dark or to shiny,switching suddenly from cloudy to sunny and all that is becoming tiring for the eyes very fast. And the handling in not simulated in any way especially that there is not a speed limiter like in Mafia 2 to just cruize along.   https://s13.postimg.org/sebb3a3uf/mafia3_2016_10_07_17_41_19_19.jpg    https://s21.postimg.org/3sgxhqz2f/mafia3_2016_10_07_18_02_41_40.jpg   https://s22.postimg.org/buz7lg96p/mafia3_2016_10_07_18_02_54_44.jpg    https://s21.postimg.org/7hwe9zdmv/mafia3_2016_10_07_18_04_22_08.jpg   https://s12.postimg.org/8a0wer5tp/mafia3_2016_10_07_18_04_25_46.jpg 
12125	970gtx 30-70 frames depending what your doing in the game , graphic arnt wow.. they are like ok  update: serveral bugs and crashes.... and really struggling to finish this game its that boring ... its one of those games where you get nothing out of it and keep waiting for something redeemable then spend so much time on it you feel you have to finish it... i would say dont even get this game get mafia 2 may not have as good graphics... but its twice the game that mafia 3 is...    playing what i have played so far capturing two whole terrorities ,this game doesnt live up to mafia 2 infact its a step backwards in many ways... you will know if you played mafia 2 before  also if your playing this because of the whole back mob thing thinking it wil be a new different kind of mob story... when your really think about it you could be playing as a white dude... yes there is racism to make you feel like your killing these dudes because of that... but its a poor attempt...  the game doesnt feel as dynamic as mafia 2 for reasons ill list below...  1. the mechanics dont feels as dynamic as mafia 2... there is something off about it i cant put my finger on it ... maybe its the fact you cant repair your engine or it doesnt die... car damage feels off i feel like i can smash into a brick wall and still drive. police dont turn up after you rob someone and corner off the building... police dont feel as aggressive.. dont set up roadblocks... dont chase you if you speed, dont stop or chase you just because they feel like it (racism?)  2. the story is super repeatitive .... like kill a bunch of dudes over and over .. collect this... yes the cutscenes tie it together (but they are starting to become a bore) but the rest of the game feels like a drag... theres no thing like (mafia 2 spoiler) rescue leo cos the mob is about to kill and also your friend is doing the hit act fast.... the story tied with the gameplay just feels a little bland  3. i dont feel any emotion for lincoln like i did vito... personally... this is possible because its a bit of a grind to play where as mafia ever bit felt like you where experiencing his life doing things for reasons... earning money for reasons... this revenge story feels drawn out... vito doesnt feel like the vito we know either ...but maybe he has changed over the years who knows.. so id allow for that ... he feels more of a â¥â¥â¥â¥ you vito... i dont care about anyone ... whereas in mafia two he cared about his family joe ect...  4. although the map is big personally i got bored of the map quick especially with all the run here do this missions.. i ended up skipping the side missions because i could tell after doing three sets of them they were completely boring ... the only reason to spend your time with it is cutscenes with the side characters  good things about the game.. are soundtrack, cutscenes.... and maybe story but i cant be arsed to grind through this to play all of it...    i recommended this game on a sale and if you dont mind grinding a bit .... good played in little bits when only doing story missions...
12126	A big dissapointment.. I'd rather buy it on sales period after 6 months or so. TOO many bugs, the missions repeatble in the same numb sequence. The crews after every racket capture are same regardles their boss, only their colors change. The story though and the numbers of missions are kinda sufficient though. Nevertheless , its a very, very sloppy outcome.
12127	Worst console port ever... Those devs give a â¥â¥â¥â¥ about PC-gamer. Even with the fps-patch its almost unplayable. Full of bugs, crashes and other weird stuff.  + Story + Characters  - AI is insanely stupid - Graphics... come on man its 2016. It looks like Mafia 2 - Performance... 50 fps with GTX 980 TI, i7 4770K - Bugs
12128	I've played Mafia I, II and now this. The game looks rubbery, its extremely boring and repetive, graphics are bad and the city is not lively. This game consists of mostly grinding, assasins creed style district takeover. No soul, no true story or advancement. Everything this game consists of is repetitions and grinding. Only a few characters that have any personality or life, rest is just gray mass, for example: Holding up a drug dealer versus a high end mafia man in a mission, both act the exact same way, both areas are setup the same way enemy wise and you ALWAYS have to do the SAME thing, run up to the target and press Q, its always the same, knife on the throat and same dialogues. The game is dead, its a ripoff and a huge letdown for the erlier Mafias. You ruined a great game series with this. This is just constant NOTHING. the game makes you feel empty. And last words, this has _nothing_ to do with what Mafia games are about. This has nothing to do with Mafia, this game is about a PTSD Vietnam veteran who snapped and is brutally killing everybody. Btw, after stabbing 100 persons with the Q button, you get so bored of him cutting open throats and sticking the knife into people. Its not classy like erliers where, its plain, repetive and the last and the most horrific, its _ARCADE_. You are constantly following ONSCREEN advice and MARKERS, it takes the last bit of fun out of the game, its so arcade, so easy and so handheld game that it hurts and insults me. Please, do not buy this game, you will feel bad for supporting this ripoff, the producers are not even trying anymore, stop buying â¥â¥â¥â¥ thats coated in glitter.
12129	Crashes when you select Start Game in the launcher. Trying to raise awareness for these issues.  (Will write review when the game is fixed.)  EDIT: I have verified the game installation. I have tried reinstalling the game. I've done both of these twice. I updated my drivers. I also tried redownloading Microsoft C++ 2015. No my computer is not a potato.  Intel i5-4690K 3.50GHz GeForce GTX 970 8 GB RAM  I'm sorry I haven't included these details before. And I yes I watch some porn myself.
12130	  inconsistant crashing makes this game a miserable play at times. when it stays up, it's pretty fun. glad I didn't spend money on tihs title (came via a digital download with my MOBO)
12131	The game is fun to play and I like where it's going but it's very much unplayable at this point. I'm using a gtx 1070 and even though I can live through the 30 fps lock, the game is crashing every 10 minutes and in every cutscene. Will change review when the game gets a much needed patch to fix the crashes.
12132	  Odd and cranky movement commands. Long and many cutscenes. Quite boring at times. I love Mafia II. Not recommended to purchase at full price. I got this game free from a purchase of an Asus GTX 1060 6gb.
12133	**First Impression**  At this point in time i can't recommend Mafia III. It doesn't feel like a Mafia to me at all. It feels really choppy and the controlls feel...weird... driving also does not feel like Mafia games used to feel. To quick, cops don't care about going to fast/passing red lights..well at least they never wanted to give me a ticket yet, which was one of THE features i got hyped about in the first Mafia for some reason.   Also it looks...â¥â¥â¥â¥ in my eyes at least. First time i started it up it looked like some game from the early 2000s to me. Graphic settings were set to 'optimal' which was the standard config, so i switched to custom and upped everything to the max.... didn't see much of a difference happening.
12134	Mafia III comes strong out of the gate but then slows down and turns into a marathon grind. Many features that you would expect to be in the game are noticably absent (some are promised in future patches) and while the core gameplay of driving and shooting is satisfying, how they are executed in the game is pretty lame. Repetitive missions for each district require you to do the same 4 activities before you can challenge the racket bosses which allow you to challenge the capo. The 4 activities are: Kill some people, destroy some things, interrogate some people, or steal some things. Nothing else.  The game does contain some very notable bright spots. The representation of the location, a New Orleans-clone in 1968 Louisiana, is beautifully depicted and contains the institutional bigotry and racism that were a horrendous hallmark of the era. The characters can be compelling and interesting and the cutscenes are like watching a movie, engrossing you in the story's progression. As stated before, the shooting and driving mechanics are fun and even though it's a typical cover-based shooter, it feels more satisfying as you use your pistol to snipe shot someone 50 yards away (kind of like the AI does in other games...). The cars handle better than refrigerators on wheels, but still lack the finesse of cars with power steering. It's that delicate balance that makes driving enjoyable. Also the period soundtrack is amazing, although I'm kind of disappointed that Jimi Hendrix's 'All Along the Watchtower' is only played during the opening menu... Any fan of 1960s music will appreciate the soundtrack in the game.  Missing features plague the game to keep it from being a truly enjoyable experience. The lack of a home base to store cars, change outfits, collect earn, or even upgrade to spend money on, kind of makes the experience pretty hollow. It feels less like you're running a criminal organization and more like you're just running around killing mostly racist people in your linear quest for revenge. 2K did say that they were going to patch in character customization (e.g. the ability to change outfits), but that should have already been included from the start. Even the 60+ FPS framerate needed a patch that was released a day after the game came out. Why 2K feels the need to patch these things in at a later time is beyond me. You should not be paying $60+ dollars for an incomplete product.  Mafia III is best enjoyed in short bursts, grinding out a racket or two in between other games. I hoped that 2K wouldn't be patching in features at a later date, but it seems like that's what you're going to have to wait for. Don't buy it in its current state for full price. Wait for the new features to be patched in and then buy it. It can be an enjoyable experience and hopefully once it's complete, the game will live up to the potential that was laid down from the beginning.  Pros: - Good setting - Combat/Driving is fun - Decent main storyline, when you're not grinding it out - Good voice acting - Great soundtrack  Cons: - Incredibly stupid driver/pedestrian AI - Enemy AI is pretty shaky - Repetitive grinding for Rackets/Bosses/Capos - No character customization (promised in later patch) - No car storage - No hideout - Repetitive animations - Wonky weather system - Dated graphics - Graphical glitches - Couple of crashes (3 so far at the time of writing this review) - Feels rushed and unfinished  [Update: The devs have patched in outfit customization and car customization. But for me, it feels a little too late. I've already beaten the game and I really have no desire to go back and grind out the game just for the features they should have added in before release. I think starting now, it would be a good game to buy, on sale, at least 25% off. 2K needs to be punished for not releasing a complete game and foolishly giving them full price for an incomplete game, like I did, just rewards the bad behavior and will encourage them to do it later.]
12135	**First Impression**  At this point in time i can't recommend Mafia III. It doesn't feel like a Mafia to me at all. It feels really choppy and the controlls feel...weird... driving also does not feel like Mafia games used to feel. To quick, cops don't care about going to fast/passing red lights..well at least they never wanted to give me a ticket yet, which was one of THE features i got hyped about in the first Mafia for some reason.

Graphic settings were set to 'optimal' which was the standard config, so i switched to custom and upped everything to the max.... didn't see much of a difference happening.
12136	As of right now i think its best to wait to get this game. It starts off great but is destroyed by pc issues. The game is locked at 30 fps if you care about that and I crashed alot. Im only into 40 mins in and the game has crashed on me 4 times.   Once these issues are fixed i will update it   pc specs gtx 970 Intel core i5 4960k
12137	The game is technical tragedy. It lags, crashes and looks like a game from 2007. Also a 30fps lock, which is UNACCEPTABLE on PC.  Too bad, because the game itself is really fun, and the story is good.  They will probably fix it, but you can launch your game only once, and Mafia 3 blew it. Fix it.
12138	30 FPS lock in 2016? Your funny.  (Updated review when 2K fixes this)   EDIT:  Pros:  Fun and interesting Gameplay Great Story  Cons: Repetitive missions 30 FPS lock Mouse Acceleration Potato Graphics   EDIT 2:  The game was patched... it runs worse. I can't get a steady 60 FPS with GTX 1070 and i5 6600K?  Again. The missions go like this:  -Talk to someone -interrogate/kill/sabatoge someone -a miniscule story mission which, again, is just kill/interrogate.  The really messed up.
12139	The story seems great, but the game is of so low quality that it hurts. It feels like the developers never ever tried the game on PC. So far I've had crashes, buttons that I'm supposed to press that's not working(and then the only way is to kill the game, cause settings are then disabled). Tha game graphics also seems strange but still heavy to run.  This game seems rushed and unfinished, but it might become a great game if they put some time into fixing stuff.
12140	Perfect example of PC players being treated like second class citizens by big company, even tho it's this very people who supported them all this years. They seem to think we are their test players and not paying customers. For all those who know about X Rebirth release, This is it...   Console games not optimized for PC!!! 
12141	Mafie is not a great game. It's not even a good one. It's okay.  It's two years past (god, it turned out to be 3 already) we got GTA V and it's main competitors didn't capture what makes such games awesome.  It's a combination of interesting characters, fresh story and well though mechanics.  Unfortunately, Mafia 3 gets not more than 6 out of 10 on all of this points.  Characters are pretty stereotypical, considering ongoing political agenda. U got rough but means good black guy, you got sneaky and cocky CIA operative, you get couple italian, irish and black allies. And all of the enemies are sick â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ in one or the other way. Plus exactly one main character in each side is woman. 4/10  Story is also quite boring. Seen multiple times 'I'll revenge death of my close ones, while deciding weather i'm good or bad person'. Side quests are written pretty good. You get the feel of the era, but that's about it. Final twists are actually great, but they do not overcome all the boredome of 30+ hours (2 first hours and last one are good). 6/10  Mechanics is the worst here. It seems developers got lazy or cocky or put into position of rushing the game, so you basically have couple very boring things to do. Drive around, kill or kinda-kill-interrogate (shoot, until he knees, then hold one button, then actually kill him), do it 5-10 times, kill mini-boss (same as interrogation), do all of this twice, get district, assign it to one of your allies, get some quire irrelevant perk, do it all over again 8 more times.   And yeah, to maximize your profits you actually have to drive at least 18 times all across other end of the map, make routin kill of everyone around, get into the truck and slowly ride all the way back. Oops, 20 minutes just went out of the window 17 of which are dull driving. And there is no fast travel at all.  Finishers are dull, it feels like it's 15-20 of them. Stealth gets really boring fast. Takes too much time without getting things easier. You can just stay in distance and shoot everyone with best gun you have unlocked so far.   Ocassionally you get some interesting cutscene or minigame like boxing or untying yourself, but that's it. 3/10  And I get it. It's hard to develop a lot of new and fresh mechanics on every corner of the game. Learn from GTA then. Script some great missions over and over again. Put a bomb under car. Poision drugs. Wreck a train. Steal some fuel from airport. Swap cash for guns deal. Smoke out some people on a factory. Put some fun dialogues while you driving.   But you get nothing.  Game tries to be engaging, educational, eye-opening, atmospheric, dynamic, a bit of strategic and economical, a bit of RPG and raising some moral questions. Instead it turned out to be dull and cliched.  Don't waste your money or what's most important - time. Go play GTA or FarCry 3 if you still haven't.
12142	  Disadvantages: NO vehicle modifications. NO posiblity to buy/upgrade a car, house, garage. (I have half mln. cash in vault.) Many similar missions. There is useless mirrow but no cockpit view. You can't repair car or fuel up car like in MAFIA II (2)  To easy to rob a shop. Not posible to change outfits. like in MAFIA II (2)  Advantages: Open World. Good (but not excellent graphics) Posibility to change driving styles (Sim, normal ) Lots of shops to rob ( still to small reward from it) 
12143	Locked at 30fps.  UI is garbage at anything over 1920x1080.  This is quite possibly the most zero-effort port I've ever seen and I've played the original Final Fantasy 7 port that didn't let you rebind the controls off the number pad.
12144	Absolutely not recommended :(  Boring as hell...repeat, repeat, repeat...infinite loop.  0 customization, 0 alternative activities, 0 originality... -.-  Graphics are poor even for 2010... GTA V's are much much much better than this ****  This is the last Mafia I buy.  PD: Do you want a mafia experience? 'The Godfather II' is much funnier than this 'game'  2 / 10
12145	Absolutely waste of money if you think you're buying anything like the last 2 games.  Where to even begin on this money grabbing train wreak.  First of, the glitches and the bugs that are so painfully apparent in the game that should have been fixed long before release. First released on 30 FPS then an update made to reach 60.  The weather and day night system is so broken it's not funny, you can be driving at night one moment and then suddenly be driving in day the next, only to return to night a second later with completely random rain.  Secondly, there is no point in this game being open world exploration at all, the money you make can only buy weapons and ammo, there is no changing of attire, upgrading cars (I know that is coming later but it's so insanely stupid that it's not apart of the original product) No other interaction beside story line quests.  This is pathetic compared to the last 2, it's your standard triple A money grabbing peice of trash. Do your self a favour and do not buy this.  0/10 
12146	Cannot recommend this game currently, which is a shame considering how much I was looking forward to playing it. Locked frame rate of 30fps for ANY PC game is unforgivable as far as I'm concerned, give people the chance to lock the framerate themselves but don't not give an option in the first place! The graphics just seem...washed out and blurry like I'm playing the game looking through frosted glass and more like a playstation 3 port at current state. The attention to the little details also which immerse you in games like these in the little while I've played, seem poor. For example I've walked past three mirrors in Sammy's bar, not one reflection, so either secretly Lincoln is a vampire or they just forgot about those little details. Hopefully things will improve with a patch, but we shouldn't have to expect that from every game which comes out, which sadly it seems more often the case now than not. If you were looking forward to this game, give it a miss for now and wait for a patch or two.
12147	Oh well this game is so limited if it comes to physics, graphics, game settings. It's just terrible. 30FPS lock did I mentioned that? ;)   The open world is not sdo open and is very limited. Do not expect to be able to do even half of the things you can do in GTA V. GTAV thta is the proper open wirld game. Not this one.  Textures in this game and details... OMG it's just terrible.   I do not own top end game rig but it is not that bad either. GTX970, i7 4790K, 16GB of 1600MHz RAM, and the games crashes and stutters from time to time.   The game lookd really awful but the only thing that keeps me going is the story. The story is great. The rest is just not even medicore. If you're OK with that, oh well buy it. If I would knew what I know already I would wait for a sale which will probably will happen soon as the reviews are not so good...  It's your call guys but I would recommend to wait fro a sale...
12148	No UI Scaling No Cloud Saves  Even after the patch with dual 1080s the game struggles to hit 60 FPS.  People are saying that the story becomes repetitive, I have to say that I am not sure as I have not gone through it enough to find out and at this point I have stopped playing until at least the 3 issues above are rectified.   At this point in time, I definitely do not recommend it. A very bad port that makes you think you are actually living in 1968  EDIT: Engrish.
12149	âGame looks like â¥â¥â¥â¥  âGame plays like â¥â¥â¥â¥  âGame performs like â¥â¥â¥â¥   ââ¥â¥â¥â¥ game confirmedï»¿!
12150	Just a precursor to this review, I grew up playing the original Mafia back in the early 2000's and I have Mafia II for both my Xbox 360 and PC. I remember purchasing Mafia II right at release six years ago and within the first few minutes of gameplay, I fell in love with the game. Mafia II still remains one of my favorite games to this day and I'm sure I've spent hundreds of hours throughout the years playing it on my 360.   Mafia III failed to captivate me like the first two games did. The most prominent flaw lies within the art design. While the cutscenes look great, the in-game graphics at max settings, 1440p look like something out of 2006. Blurry textures, horrible lighting, poor render resolution, â¥â¥â¥â¥ yellow filter (which can't be turned off), and way too much fog are some of the most noticeable problems. Paired with terrible framerate, braindead AI, and clunky keyboard and mouse controls, this game is a major disappointment for me. Mafia II from 2010 actually looks and plays better than its successor which came out six years later. Mafia III's story and gameplay may very well be good but the technical issues are bad enough that I don't want to force myself to keep playing. Oh, and if the capped framerate wasn't bad enough, SLI doesn't work either so one of my graphics cards is acting as an expensive paper weight right now. Suck my unit, 2k. You killed one of my favorite series. Refunded.
12151	Don't waste money on this game...Go and buy Battlefield 1
12152	This is the first Mafia game I have played, everyone raved about the previous story lines so I thought I'd give it a go. How dissapointing. It doesn't run well, is riddled with bugs (cars floating without wheels etc) and is mediocre at best. The story seems to bump along and the world is lifeless. Why didn't I just load up GTA V again..?! I can't get a refund but luckily I didn't pay full price. I can't recommend this and I can't see how it will be improved even with patches, so save your money and play some GTA instead.
12153	heist was great now go kill this guy now go kill this guy now go kill this guy now go kill this guy now go kill this guy now go kill this guy now go kill this guy now go kill this guy now go kill this guy now go kill this guy now go kill this guy 
12154	Do not buy it, it feels like u are playing a game from 2009, very bad grafic and bad game play
12155	Unfortunately this is currently a let down. Full controller support is BS for PC at the moment. There's no corresponding display icons and the game's pop up windows require a keyboard to exit out of. Very annoying when you want to put your Steam link to use. I also had 2 crashes. Now I'm waiting for a patch to come out before I even start it up again.
12156	patch just came out - crashes every 30mins or so - - so its a â¥â¥â¥â¥ of a game on pc - beware!!!!
12157	Windows 10 x64, nvidia geforce 980Ti 6GB... everytime computer reboot after first cutscene with Kernel-power error code 41 .. latest drivers.. X_X
12158	It was a good idea to have: - Great and intriguing story/characters - Great fitting soundtrack - Great driving engine  - Believable facial textures  It was a bad idea to release with: - 30fps lock  wait for the patch. unacceptable.
12159	Mafia II has been released in 2010 and it's still a good looking game even nowadays and also a fun game to play , I was expecting them to do the same with this title too  Mafia III is decent, but it could've been better, I feel like they don't give that much attention to us, the pc gamers  The 30 FPS Cap shows it pretty clearly, they post on the community hub and say that they are working to fix the issue and we should expect soon to be able to play in 60 FPS, is this a joke, in 2016 you release a game like this with 30 FPS Cap and also blurry textures ported from console ?   Pretty disappointing
12160	I expected a lot more. The graphics are mediocre at highest settings and although the main story is interesting, the missions get quite repetitive and boring.
12161	I want to love this game so much. It has everything required to make a good game, a interesting backstory and time, originallity and a good dev team but it falls short on every aspect but originality. The concept and story is great in theory but it does not live up to expectations in any sense of the word. The driving is too powerful, the combat is sloppy, the sneaking is just awful in general but the worst is the AI. The AI is so bad and this ruins the game. Im ashamed for it to be a mafia game As I enjoyed the previous mafia games. I do not reccomend.
12162	Screen tears and 30fps... Come on man I'm not playing a xbox one
12163	In the beginning, I felt so excited but now its really boring, everything are the same!
12164	1. Wait for patch 2. Try to play 3. Crash 4. Crash 5. Crash 6. Controller setting go off  Okay, great, now we have 60 FPS but it doesn't really help to make game any good - it still crashes every here and there, controller mapping disappear, AI is dumb as hell, your character can get stuck near knee high obstavles, cars drive awkwardly and graphics quality is way worse than Mafia 2. This game surely gets 'Dissapointment of the Year' prize.
12165	I ain't seen textures this good since WarZ!
12166	I pre-order this game and im disappointed with everything expect story. First what im going to do is cancel all pre-orders BF1, Dishonored 2, For the Honor etc... Im not gonna pre order anything. You will enjoy story for sure but gameplay, textures, low fps and other stuff you will say why the hell i bought this crap. Im not gonna lie and say i didnt enjoy even with those problems but recommend this game to someone NO WAY! I was so mad on first day of release because of 30 fps lock.  People dont pre order games because developers rush their games and make them unplayable  . They also patch 30fps and put unlimited fps but even after that game stutter and lag. Wont even talk about bugs (flying cop cars etc..). They develop this game for 6 years and what they did nothing. Mafia 2 is better in all aspects. Im so sad that Hangar13 ruined mafia series like that. I regret pre-ordering this game and buying on steam store for full price. People if you are here for the story buy the game but its gonna be frustrating play this game on 49 fps not even :S. Wait for sale or buy cheap on other site.   For those still looking how bad mafia 3 is look at this video    Mafia 2 vs Mafia 3   Thanks for reading!
12167	+ Story  + Music + Shooting &amp; AI damage hitpoints + Ambience  + Sounds are nice except for car sounds. Voice-acting is very good. The car sounds itself aren't that great and also won't adjust to surroundings (including the car horn). I have the feeling they didn't have time to implement this. They did have time to add an effect when you ride into a big garage underground and the radio signal gets messy.    -  30 fps lock on release  (removed with patch) - poorly optimized for pc - game crashes  - Low texture quality - Sometimes texture pop-ins - Weather skybox - Launcher settings not applied in-game - Broken key-rebinding. Latest patch solved a few things, but still broken.  - Enemy AI sometimes spots you through buildings - Gameplay gets repetitive  - Cars damage model - Fighting compared to previous Mafia is simplistic   Save your money. Also comparing to Mafia 2 a lot of smaller things are missing like particle physics, world interaction (police bribing, kicking doors, eating hotdogs, ..)
12168	Pros: -Awesome game -Spanish voices  Cons:  -30fps lock -developers laugh at us -30fps lock -some major bugs -30fps lock  Aditional cons: -30fps lock  note: 30/60
12169	---MAFIA III Review--- Okay folks I was very hyped for this game, honestly who wouldn't be? An open world, crime, sequel of Mafia II set in New Orleans, with freedom to approach any mission the way you please, sounds great right? What we got was horrible optimization, hardly any freedom in terms to activities, and just pure utter disappointment. The story is actually pretty good, but the way the missions are executed is horrible. You do the same thing each time, Interrogate a dude, kill some guys, break some things, then kill the boss. Rinse wash repeat. It's horrible, but the one thing I'm utterly disappointed in is the lack of activities in the game. In Mafia II, speeding was considered a ticktable offense and you could actually get tickets. Now they just throw themselves at you and try to gun you down. You can't even sit down at the diner and enjoy some good ole' southern Boudain, you can merely rob it for it's petty cash. This game was rushed out, and poorly executed. I do not recommend this game for the price of $60...
12170	The game itself is great. The storyline is awesome, the cut scenes are really detailed and well polished BUT and I mean this is a big but, this game isn't ready. Like everyone else, the 30FPS lock is extremely frustrating. It took me a while to get used to it enough so I could play it. Also, i've noticed randomly the game will freeze for a few seconds, then resume, then freeze again when I am entering a new area. (This isn't a hardware issue I run all other games just fine). A lot of people are saying stop being so hard on the devs for the issues but I disagree. These are easy fixes that should have been seen way before launch day. If you haven't bought the game yet, I would wait until the the patch comes out to fix these issues.
12171	Buy Watch Dogs 2.  ACTUALLY optimised and has more gameplay variety.
12172	I loved Mafia 1 and 2 and I was excited to buy Mafia 3. But I was Disappointed when I played it. It felt like Mafia 3 took a big step backward's. It felt like 2k games didn't play Mafia 1 or 2. You can not do anything in the environment. The thing I loved the most in Mafia 2 is the Interaction with the world around you. In Mafia 3 the world around you is dull and boring. The people just walk and weight and in Mafia 2 the NPC walked, talked to you and other people, they look at stuff and waved they even read newspapers. you can open the hood and trunk of your car but you cant do that in Mafia 3. And the police are so @#&amp;! frustrating in Mafia 3 but in Mafia 2 the police arent to bad and you can bribe the police. The only thing I liked about Mafia 3 is the story and songs. This is just my opinion.
12173	complete waste of money...lame graphics, horrible gameplay. Only good thing is the setting and music imo
12174	When Mafia 1 is more realistic than GTA V and Mafia ||| shame !!!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ1YMeY07xI 
12175	Worst game ever ! and No Turkish Language Support !  Just watch it u can understand what i mean :P   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKTZObO3bew 
12176	This is the worst Mafia title to date. First problem 30fps lock for PC. Second problem, bad console port considering Mafia was always a PC title when it first came around back in the days. Third problem, there's no customization what so ever, you can't go into any stores to buy clothes or anything, the only purpose the stores have is to rob the cash register and there's hardly any around. Fourth problem, there's no longer any gas in vehicles, which was always a thing in Mafia games, so gas stations have no purpose what so ever. Fifth problem, regular crashes from time to time which makes it unbearable to play. Sixth problem, there's CONSTANT pop-up windows trying to explain â¥â¥â¥â¥ to you over six hours into the game. For â¥â¥â¥â¥ sake 2k, what the hell did you idiots take making this game? Seventh problem, they're reusing waaaaay to many assets for missions and side-missions. What a joke and the list goes on.  One positive thing I found in this title was the radio messup when driving through tunnels, that was a really nice touch.  I'd recommend Mafia I or II, but III not going to happen. Wait for patches and mods to come out before playing this title unless you want cancer. 2.0/10.  'I never asked for this.' - Adam Jensen.  Added video that shows just how better Mafia II is vs Mafia III:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHjeDvnSPPA 
12177	EDIT: The patch has landed and with it there is some good news and bad news, perfomance is everywhere, if you get 60, be glad, some people even with gtx1080 can't reach 60, it's still early though, i myself can't get the option to work and i will have to do a fresh install i think, but i will do that later, ui scale has not been fixed yet so it is still rather bad for my screen sadly.  It's still early for the game and they have promished more patches, it is a good start, but the game is still not in a good shape of what you can expect from a pc game.  Wait for a sale if you want the story, and if you use a widescreen monitor (aspect ratio 21:9) be sure to check that the ui scale has been fixed, else you will have a really bad experience with it.  TDLDR; Bugs a plenty, fps is fixed (mostly) performance is all over the place and with a screen that goes above 1080p be sure to check for bugs on the net on forehand, i can not recommend the game right now.  The story however should be excellent, sound fantastic and gameplay good, but for me the game has too many issues regarding my system (ui scale, turning my keyboard light off and oddly enough options not saving so i can't use the new 60fps/unlimited, will try a fresh install later, but for now the new options aren't working even when changed manually in the configs).  Edit: As it seems people do not understand what i mean by UI scale, if you play at 1080p it is most likely fine, but at 1440p, oh boy the game will most likely be unplayable   http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/438364144686443853/B5390B400B7C541B203BAC2D6D5BE88DD048A798/   You can check my other screens of the game as they are from the same screen and how they look at various resolutions, the aspect ratio is 16:9 and the screen I'm using is a pg279q rog swift.
12178	sh!t, â¥â¥â¥â¥, â¥â¥â¥â¥, â¥â¥â¥â¥. System exceeds minimum but can't get the game to play. Grrrrr
12179	I really wish I didn't buy this game..I played both Mafia &amp; Mafia 2 and loved them both. I was so excited for this one that I actually pre-ordered it, something I rarely do. Came home from work on the day it released and played it for probably 6 hours straight. I have to admit, the storyline and cutscenes had me gripped at first, but it was quickly overshadowed by the horrible performance issues and constant crashes. I soon realized that the game is extremely repetitive, something I didn't expect at all. It's literally the same type of missions over and over and OVER..what were they thinking..!?  Now, several weeks later, I don't even play it anymore. Even after the 'performance updates', the game runs pretty much just like before; like â¥â¥â¥â¥. I even went out and upgraded my GTX 960 to a GTX 1060 6GB...almost zero boost in performance (at least none worth mentioning). I get pretty much the exact same FPS as before, even though all my other games run amazing now. From what I've been reading, even people with 1080s and i7s struggle to get 50-60 FPS, which is just pathetic!! So many bugs and glitches in the game that it really takes you out of the zone and reminds you that you're playing a video game...a crappy one at that. No joke, I have played early access games that were more prepared for release than this garbage - it's a slap to face! It's completely disrepectful, something EA would do!!  I'm not even mad...I'm terribly upset and disappointed. I have waited several years for this game to come out and it was a total failure in my book, or at least the PC release. If you ask me, 2k should be working their asses off to get this game running perfectly and from what I see, they've shown almost no remorse and have done very little to fix their screw-up of a game. They released this game entirely too early and they know it. It's so horribly optimized that it's laughable and if I even thought for a second that Steam would give me a refund, I'd be fighting like hell for it.  Total waste of money and I will think twice before buying Mafia IV, or any 2K or Hanger 13 game for that matter.  AND BY THE WAY - After reading these positive reviews, I'm convinced the majority of people are either paid to write positive reviews, or they have some type of affiliation with the creators. There's no freaking way someone could think so highly of this, much less ever recommend it to their friends. They aren't very good friends if so.
12180	This review is into the technical aspect of things; I might update it when I am getting a bit more into the actual gameplay.   However, the first look at this game cries 'lazy port from console' out of every of its voids:  - 30 fps lock and graphics look like rendered from an internally low resolution badly upscaled to the actual screen resolution - in fact, lower graphic settings can give a clearer pictures. For example, the higher the antialias settings, the more the picture is smeared onto the screen. Yes, less jaggies around the edges, but not in a good sense, because less detail overall. To make it even more tedious, every game restart revertes antialias back to high - though you can choose lots of screen resolutions, not all of them play out properly. For example, 1920x1080 resolution will have text messages on the screen that overlap each other in an akward and sometimes unreadable way - There is a menu to rebind controls, however a) not all keys that work in most PC games as bind are possible and b) even if you can rebind a control doesn't mean it will work ingame (for example, binding movement controls to mousebuttons are accepted in the binding screen, but simply won't work later)  I know the devs are saying they have a PC patch in the making. However, from what I have seen so far, I don't expect too much. So far, it looks like the game is ported from consoles (and their quality definitions, meaning peasant hardware) via an emulator, and system requirements have been defined by: - Minimum: Anything that can run the game - Recommended: Anything that is able to reach the 30 fps lock  So, my expectation for the patch is what I experienced with Evil Within: PC Patch for uncapping fps, leading to max. 40 fps given the recommended hardware instead of 30 fps locked. And we don't know if the game will run into problems later when there is more than 30 fps, because what I have seen so far from (obviously not!) testing different settings (see the text overlap problem at 1920x1080 resolution and the control binding problems) says 'give the pc guys some options so we can say we did, who the hell cares if they work properly'.  Maybe they should have taken the GTA V approach and take a year to make it an acceptable port to PC.  So to summarize: In its current state, I cannot recommend the game given its AAA price while its subpar technical quality. Not broken, but there is definetly some room for improvement.  UPDATE / Addition after the Patch 1.01 on 9th of october:  Framerate not locked to 30 fps anymore. However, quite exactly what I expected: It is running at 40 fps now. Well, when fiddling with the settings it gets the fps into the playable 50ies (floating between 40 and 80 depending on the rendered scene).  Also quite expected about the rest of the patch: Though they said they worked on the control bindings, what I would like to have as control layout STILL DOESN'T WORK. Concerning the antialias setting not saving: I had to redo it once, however, another time it was saved correctly between games. Lets see how that works out in the long run.  So, there is improvement, at least I am getting not so sick from playing anymore, however there is still a long way to go. This patch made the game from a no-no to rather no.  Addition 10th october:  After playing a bit longer, I got to say that i am not impressed. Other bugs, annoyances and general cheap and lazy programming / design attitude are just the icing on the unsharp low fps graphics: - uneven loudness of character voices in one and the same dialogue  - drove the car into water -&gt; instant death - characters doing idle / bored animation while talking a sad story about their past   The story can't make up for all that shortcomings, lazyness, and sheet.  Unfortunately, it's too late for a refund now. Thanks to all the defenders of bad games who say you can't judge if you haven't play long enough. My initial impression didn't change. So, lets just eat this subpar thing because we paid for it, and get even more cautios when preordering next time.  So my final suggestion is: Buy it when its price tag falls below 20 bucks. Because it is a poor man's gta v. But still needs a very beefy graphics card. I get two times the fps in gta v compared to this â¥â¥â¥â¥ here.  Update 25th november: Game still sucks. I just nominated if for the âPutting an end to a great franchise by totally â¥â¥â¥â¥ing up the latest installmentâ Award
12181	As a punitive action for this developer releasing the game in a state contrary to previous representation I am submitting a permanent negative review. Developers have a responsibility to stop doing this. I will not change this review. Redistributable files such as directx and c++ should install automatically before startup. Graphics options should be greater or equal to console equivalint, not less. I had to sit through 5 minutes of game crashes to be authorized to leave this review.
12182	Well, I never add comments to steam games, but I believe that I'll save money for some of you.  # All missions are the same  # Many bugs that're drivig me crazy, like:   Boss that stuck in the wall and you can't interact with him  enemies that see you in two floors above of you   Items that you have to destroy but you can't  and many more... # Missions are too easy.  # You can kill squad of enemies with only knife # Stupid bots  Bottom line, this gave not deserve this price!!! 
12183	Mafia III review from someone who played 1st and 2nd many times  I won't beat around the bush, 3rd part was a complete disaster from my point of view. No feeling of Mafia at all, some guy from the hood wants a revenge and goes berserk. I managed to pass the game regardless of pain and agony in my heart thinking how they managed to name this game after Mafia franchise...  Some pointers in general  Negative: - Main character goes whole game with no suit on ('very mafia like...') - No public transport throughout the city (there are rails, but nothing ever goes on them...) - City in general looks vague and empty (expected more from game this size) - Mafia 1 AI was better than here (it tells alot, and no, it's not a joke) - Don't look into the sky - Car handling reminds Need for Speed - 0 challenge - Cops... what cops... - Because of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ police there is no speed limiter for your vehicle anymore too..  - About 90% of the game you will be doing one and same thing in same places - Very little dialogues or any kind of input through out the game (like some capo speaking next to you while you drive to places), makes whole story look bad with missing pieces - They managed to put VITO in some district manager's place... what can i say...  Positive: - Cinematic and lip sync was great, really great - I won't need to pass this game again  Creators took everything great from this game and added Assassin's creed and GTA elements. Do not buy this game, at least not for price it goes now.  
12184	Pros: - Interesting main characters and story. - Awesome soundtrack Cons: - Mandatory sandbox to progress. Boring routine. To play each story mission player should grind for 2 hours. - Mediocre story missions.  - No characters development in missions. - Not consistent and sometimes awful graphics. - Strange control scheme. Why scope is on another button that aiming down sights? - Cowardly consumer-unfriendly marketing with embargo on reviews before release.  5/10. Mediocre and boring game. Not candidate for buying even on discount.  
12185	An abomination of the Mafia series. Repetitive mission design and glitches ruin the foundations of an excellent game. The game does not appear to be running in native 1080p and is one of the blurriest messes I've seen this generation.  HARD PASS. Buy for $5 when (and if) they fix it.
12186	Had high hope's but  Despite all the AMD claims I am all AMD and this game runs fine. But it all ends there  awful Graphics 3/10 .30fps lock so what all Maxed Vsnk off no stutter.I experienced a lot of clipping and see thru Played 48 min on PC  played 4 hours with nefew on PS  Graphics looks no different then the PS version. I wont even re-buy it on sale for 20 bucks   Story ;Dime store book at best After 1 hour on PS it was old and predictable  Played the 48 min on hardest settings Pc All I can say is Really WTF. A 10 year old could beat this game with out a Youtube vid or a walk thru guide there is nothing to do but follow all the markers and thats annoying as all hell. Aiming on hard is easier than most games on med No in car cam driving is sluggish and slow.Even if follow all the rules of the road you will have cars pulling in front of you all the time.Seems I spent most of my driving time going around things. BOO If you want to Refund this game in the 1st 2 hours you will only have 15 minutes game play. The rest will be spent Driving LOOOOOOOOng distances and watching cut scenes. If you are 10 you will love this game . If you are looking for a challenge forget it. This is not a game It is a Movie that you get to move a character around in sometimes getting to shoot and pick something up  I guess you could call it a collecting game also. There's most likely that part.I saw some things to collect. so is just a guess  very disapointed with this game  Refunding
12187	So personally I've never bought many games on launch day. I'm always the guy reading reviews about day 1 crashes and instability problems. This time the role is reversed.  This review isn't about the game, rather it's about the frequent crashing.   Every time i go into a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing cutscene i get a CTD. This is awful considering when i load back up the game, the cutscene is over and I have to piece together what happened.   Please fix your â¥â¥â¥â¥ devs. I'm not even â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ing about the 30 FPS Cap here, I simply want to watch the cutscenes on a story based game.
12188	  Repetetive quests and lack of variations in cars in traffic, weapons and quests. Mainquests are almost like the sidequests.  You do not feel that you have made a difference or that you have come forward after some quests.  Feels like the game are 50% done. Like the deadline were too close and they just had to give us SOMETHING at the realase day...  Otherwise, it's good graphics and a good open world. But that doesn't compensate the cons at all. For me it is a uninstall after just 8.3 hours of gaming...  Had high hopes on this game after Mafia: 2.
12189	So the 1.1 patch is out now and despite the fact that my PC can play Witcher 3 in Ultra Settings, modded mind. GTA V in Ultra Settings, Doom in Ultra settings all at 60fps (you get the picture) this isn't going over 42fps at the best of times. Not to mention so many graphical glitches and low res textures popping up. Never mind the repetitive missions, the only thing that is keeping me going is the interesting storyline (And most of that happens in pre-rendered cutscenes and shows you what the game could look like if they actually bothered).
12190	It was a big disappointment, for some people, it's entertaining for sure, you feel superior and strong, but it is a disaster compared to mafia 2, i don't even know where to start. 1. The vehicle physics are unbelieveable, it's a absoulte joke, in Mafia 2, you feels like you're really driving a heavy, solid car. 2. The NPC have no character, when you stroll around the streets in mafia 2, you walk at a normal speed, different people have different postures, different reactions, everything tells a story, but in mafia 3, every civilain are the same in a way. 3. The objects around Lincoln. I walked into cassandra's home, accidently knocked over a bunch of stools, they fell and break into pieces and then disappear, Okay. 4. You just keep playing, there is not much to tell, repeat repeat repeat, at the start, it's compelling, then mid-way though, you just feel like Marcano and his goons are bunch of weak studds, no one will travel with you, talk with you except for Donovan, the whole story is just lost it attractiveness, the Father James thing was also a nice touch but then it's also just not interesting to play anymore. 5. Hand to Hand Combat or takedowns, way to eaisy, some are good, most of it aren't, it makes the enimes too weak, the enimies also have no personality presence whatsoever, they are all the same, they all lack any self-preservation, stupid af, and weak, their reaction to bullet hits are also disappointing, makes you feel good but I'm not impressed with it at all like when you punch a gu in the face, he fainted, like they are acting poorly to pretend they are knocked out by lincoln. 6. Things you can do, no eating , no sleeping, no changing, no nothing, and no replaying levels, either lives and the town that you rule or start a new game, the ending was not powerful by all means, you felt like that's it, okay, goodbye. 7. Bullets hits, try shooting a car and then'll know, the glass physics is â¥â¥â¥â¥ poor, there are also no solid bullet holes, when you shoot a enemy, the guns acts like a health reductor instead of a gun, the sounds are not good the reactions of enemies are also bad. 8. Finished the game in the diffculty set to hard, still not hard and i didn't even used backups, cutting phone lines, bribing cops and weapon van, not even once. 9. the building an empire thing just dont fit well with a mafia story, it's like the underworld or criminal sim city. 10. the scene shown in the launch trailer felt nothing like the game. 11. the lsit could go on and on
12191	Played in 4k and boy is it a shity port. No UI scaling, glitches and draw distance is a joke.  sound 9/10 they should show the title of the songs , grafiks 2/10 (4k ultra), shity draw distance, shity skybox and half of the textures is â¥â¥â¥â¥, story cutscenes 6/10 story was ok  story gameplay 2/10 almost no mission variety collectibles 10/10.. collecting playboys was ok i guess  complaints: can only carry 2 guns, dumb AI, limited number of cars,   positives: aesthetic of the 60s :)   buy on sale for 10$
12192	I loved Mafia II so I was expecting something good here. But this game does not hold up to the old game, not at all. I find myself doing the same stuff over and over and over again, it quikly gets boring! Now, it's not that this game is such a bad game, it's not! But if you compare it to Mafia II it's not that good. If you have not played the second game I would recommend this game, but if you've played the second I'm not sure it's worth it. Kind of ruined the whole Mafia name for me.   There's not much detail in the game and it repeats it self too much. The graphics are nice but it doesn't matter if the game's not that good.   It was hard giving this game a thumbs down because Mafia means so much for me, but I'm hoping the dev. team can learn from this mistake.
12193	Well the game overall has huge potential but its held back by MAJOR FLAWS -HORRIBLE textures, absolute garbage,so many examples but go look at the water....it will make you cringe -HORRIBLE controller support, wont even show what buttons do what in controller layout, just shows nothing...been guessing the entire time as i dont want to play this game with k&amp;m, cant even figure out how to whistle or throw grenades. -bad 21:9 support if any, start menu is unnavigatable in 3440x1440, in game is fine for some reason after switching from 2560x1440 -30fps cap (if not fixed) -overall looks muddy like there is extreme TAA on at all times even with low AA -no button to stop sticking to cover  THE GOOD -characters are great and have alot of depth so far -Story is also really good so far (as it should be being a linear game) -DRIVING SIMULATION...thank you for that, it feels great to have different surfaces impact drifting/stopping to varying degrees -shooting supprsingly feels very good as well had alot of fun dumping a full clip of a thompson into Baka (only to have him take a knee and wait for a cut scene... really?) -lighting i feel is very good too, if only the AA and textures didnt suck so hard.  overall i feel the game isnt worth 60 dollars right now, they really need to fix the textures and AA or whatever makes this game look like im playing a cool game with vaseline slathered glasses on, because while the gameplay and story are very likeable right now, the graphics keep breaking the immersion (and so is the framerate, if you dont have Gsync, even if you do have it it would be 100% better at 60fps+)    EDIT: so the patch has just dropped and lets just say the decision to refund was almost instant lol, worst port ever. the game was capped at 30fps because theres no way in hell ur gonna run this at 60+fps unless ur at 1080p. couldnt get more than 50fps (this wasnt a constant 50 either, more,like average 45) when absolutley nothing was going on around me in a decently empty area in the game (keep in mind i run witcher 3 anywhere from 50 on very rare occasions all the way up to 90 fps on ultra without AA or hairworks on 3440x1440p). Its a real shame too as the story actualy did have me wanting to play more but i just cant do it, its no many sky performance all over again. :(
12194	Crashes on startup
12195	I really wanted to love Mafia 3, but Mafia 3 has been a huge let down. The game is simply abysmal. I've refunded and no matter how much they patch it, the first playthrough will be etched on my mind. This game could have been utterly superb but they botched it. Not only that, they misrepresented the quality too which is awful business practise. This game is not worthy to be in anyones Steam library. It should be tied up and dumped into the nearest river, I'm sure even Lincoln Clay would want that.
12196	Just more â¥â¥â¥â¥ing lazy developers.
12197	Pre-refund review, please take with a grain of salt.  Graphics-wise, it feels completely unfinished.  - Lots of blurriness or flat out ugly textures (even at 4600x1600 res). - Recurring visual glitches, such as a massive shadow on the ground approaching you when switching from overcast to clear day (and it swung back and forth between the two 4-5 times). - Car parked in garage before a cutscene got fused into the ground, turning it into scrap metal. - Sunlight bloom (or, well, not proper bloom, just a huge bright spot) clips through all objects, literally couldn't see the road in front of me because of it despite that it cut through a wall and a tree. - Graphics options are lacking, cant even turn off AA.  Gameplay-wise, your painfully average console game mechanics all the way.  - AI is typical, either stands and just shoots or runs to cover and peeks out to easily be killed, nothing worth mentioning. - Difficulty level doesn't mean much, since you're never pushed up on by the AI it's just a matter of hiding and waiting for the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ health regen. - One-button takedowns all the way, because apparently it's all about showing off animations rather than trying. - Melee is pretty much just running up and spamming one button. - Stealth is about as unimaginative as usual. Sneak up, takedown. Sneak up, whistle, takedown. Yawn. - Good point is that the enemies at least don't take 30 bullets each to kill. So at hard difficulty you can at least pretend that it's somewhat realistic. - Driving physics are fairly good at simulation mode. Crashing still seems to have no effect, with the other car often being pushed aside while you keep on driving like nothing happened. - Cops are surprisingly effective, they managed to pop two tyres and ram me into a river, nice stuff. Stopped chasing the moment I started swimming though, so meh.  None of this touches on the storyline, which I reckon is the game's strong point, because with max 2 hours I wanted to test as much as possible before 'playing for real' the next time around. However, there seems to be extremely few moral choices, so it appears that we're just along for the ride.
12198	If you liked mafia 1 and 2 you will be disapointed.  'The game is an insult to the series. What were they thinking!?
12199	Save your money and don't buy this.  The game repeats the same pattern over and over again. Kill, interrogate, destroy, steal. In some places when you have cleared a place from enemies, 10 minutes later you have to do it again, as a boss guy has appeared there.   Npc AI is weird. People can't drive at all! Ordered a shiny new car and some ammo at my location, only to find that the driver for the new car drives straight into a pole, and the ammo van crashes his car to mine a few seconds later!  I found it ridiculous when the main character was soaked in gasoline, only to light the lighter himself just a moment afterwards to light up the enemy who was also soaked in gasoline by the player. Like that wouldn't have ignited the main character as well.  The skybox is the ugliest thing I've seen in a while. And I've seen a lot of things.  Soundtrack is awesome. Voice acting is great.   I only remember a couple of fun and interesting moments in the game. That's it.
12200	Just a bad game. I'm surprised there are any good reviews.   Listen to the reviews and save yourself the money
12201	So far, lm enjoying the game. The animations, gunplay and music are on point, and the story is being told in a very interesting and enganging way.  However, due to performace issues, l simply cant reccomend this. Even with the patch, I can't get more than 50 FPS,even if l turn all settings to low, with a PC that has better specs than the ones reccomended by the developer.  Also, wtf's up with the new wanted system? It's â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. If a witness calls the cops saying some random car was stolen, the cops will not only immeditaely now it was you even without having your description or licencse plate, but will continue to pursue you if by the time they arrived you're on a different car, and they'll shoot to kill.Just for stealing a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ car. This is a major downgrade from Mafia 2's wanted system (which in my opinion is the best in any game). You can't even picklock cars anymore.  Also, on the subject of cars, is it just me or they never â¥â¥â¥â¥ing break? I need to crash several times at high speed just to see a dent in a car ffs.  Lastly, the missions so far, save for the first few ones, have been really repetitive. Go to an enemy truf, kill them, then either kill a VIP, steal some â¥â¥â¥â¥, or destroy â¥â¥â¥â¥. Over and â¥â¥â¥â¥ing over again.   To sum it up, Mafia 2 is a better game overall.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixlszwKVVP0           Also, the mirrors in this game... they're a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing joke. The fact that mafia 3 is sooooo much worse than mafia 2 is already â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up. But the fact that literally Duke Nukem has better mirrors than Maifa 3????? WHAT THE ACTUAL â¥â¥â¥â¥ï»¿ DUKE NUKEM CAME OUT 20 YEARS AGO AND HAD AN ENGINE MADE BY ONE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING GUY
12202	Whith this game i was expecting a colorful story driven and rich quest much like Mafia 2, not true here you have a rinse and repeat game play. however although the textures are better the driving physics are spongy at best, the cars don't damage as they should. The gunplay is poorly optimised and makes Clay an unrealistic one man army. The best way to sum up this game is to say that it has the graphics of a GTA game and the game play of Saints row.
12203	The game has flickering bars on 3440x1440 which for a 'next gen' game should NOT BE!  The Bloodsplatter Overlay is set to 16:9 and stays like that even if you play on 21:9... which is REALLY ANNOYING. Dont forget the 30fps cap which never got revealed until the last day before release...   So a BIG MINUS. Overhyped trash like No Mans Sky
12204	I am a huge fan of the mafia series. Been playing since xbox (mafia 1). I don't recommend this game because my system is well beyond the recommendation, yet I cannot get it to run at 60 fps unless I lower the settings to 720p. Even like that, it still drops framerate to below 45fps sometimes and the screen makes all the letters and everything so big that it covers the screen. With my system, I should be able to run the game at 4k 60fps like my other games. I think this game has some problem with nvidia and just generally does not work well. I bought it becuz I love the series, but I would suggest waiting until after they fix all bugs and the game starts running well on pc at 60 fps with max settings. Just play mafia 2 for now. That runs perfect.
12205	After Mafia II, this is a disgrace. Batman 2.0 is what you get here. I am someone that can tell a difference between 60hz and 144hz. 30FPS locked is unplayable for me. I play at 4K resolution and this game does not even support UI scaling. Everything requires me to lean forward to be able to read. The AI is god awful and stupid. They stand right in front for you to shoot them. After playing shooters like The Division, the gun gameplay in Mafia 3 feels stiff and clunky.   I never ever pre-order games and I regret I did for this one. Mistake made, lesson learned. At least I didn't pay full price for this POS port. Wait for a super patch if ur on the fence. But I will say the VO and the storytelling so far are top-notch.
12206	Nice launcher and music! Now if only the game worked...
12207	A warning to those who are thinking about buying the game. I would hold that thought for a few more days - you probably aren't going to be playing it anyway.  I really don't have a problem with the graphics. Heck, I think the game looks pretty good (so far). My problem is with how it plays... Or rather, how it doesn't play.  You can't remap keys. If you do, it apparently 'disables' that key permanently. At least that's what it did for me. - I remapped the 'Stalk' (crouch/sneak) key. Before the remap it was working. Now it isn't - and it doesn't work if I change it back either. This means I am unable to sneak, a pretty important thing really...  In addition the game keeps crashing/freezing - often, but not always, during a cutscene. When I load the game up again I am on to the next mission. This effectively means I lost part of the story. In one instance I didn't really know why I was on a mission... The story behind the mission was basically 'skipped' because the game had crashed.  To summerise.:  The game is broken -- unplayable for most people. Don't buy it until they fix it. A shame really, cause it looks so good. 
12208	I am sick of watching game trailers and being wowed only to be given a lemon when it comes out.   spend thousands on a high end PC so people on console can enjoy a smooth 30fps  Do i refund now and maybe buy it again if they fix it? or hold it in wait for a patch to give us a game that is represented in the trailers and screenshots of the game?, and not get a refund as we held it too long.....  Chances are most people buying it on PC have a Pretty decent gaming rig for todays standards and yet this shows how much they know / care / listen to gamers on PC. Like the corporate world we â¥â¥â¥â¥ing have to live in now, they care more about sales to consoles than delivering a game that is complete, tested and what people want.  i cant bare to play this game on my 4k monitor and 4k rig its like i need glasses or there is something in my eyes its got this annoying cheap blur to it, and like No mans Sky if you dont make it at least 60FPS and i see it crisp up, ill be getting a refund regardles of the gameplay, just looks so cheap.  So far i say wait, at least till 60fps patch, music and area and era seem good, and car handling is pretty good so far. will update is any changes for people with 4K setups
12209	I'm already stuck with the first mission, im suppose to take a guard down by pressing 'Q' for stealth attack but nothing happends. I love this game already.
12210	I7-6700K Turbo boosted 16gb ram  gtx 980 ti FTW  1080p max settings! 40-60 fps? really?????? this game is extremely poorly optimized for pc! like most games! except Gta 5! i freaking could play gta 5 on high 60 fps with gtx 560!    you guys should learn something from rockstar! how a open world game should really be!.   i gave you guys first a good phrase but now we get 60 fps patch my â¥â¥â¥â¥ing pc can't run it stable 60 fps? and the graphics ain't that special as well . nothing happens on the screen as well.... why am i getting 10-15 frame drops with my pc???   disappointed! also there was a guy that made a 60 fps patch before you guys literally 1 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing guy was faster than a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing studio!! i used it and was getting same fps drops so i thought it would be the guys fault who made it...... and expected that if i waited for you that i would get stable 60 fps fix. WTF!! literally WTF!   The game weapon combat sucks! its like we shooting with paint! they don't get bullet wounds, only get splatted with blood! hit the feet their whole body is bloody like we shot them with freaking paintball gun  Car physics sucks  Game performance suck graphics is nothing special. weapon combat sucks! when you kill someone they become ghosts and nothing hits them anymore you only can paint them with ( blood )if you want with your paintball guns.   with something looking like that i should be getting 100 fps with my pc.  Just because the story is good &amp; music track is good, that we should forgive all those other â¥â¥â¥â¥ that we cannot accept... no sir..... but why would you guys care right just make the money and you are good.. â¥â¥â¥â¥ us right   its like the game was made in 2013 and they tweaked a tiny tiny bit and released in 2016.  mafia 2 was way way more authentic &amp; realistic than mafia 3 and i do not think that it will get better from this point.   There you go! mafia 2 vs mafia 3! look which one is way more authentic &amp; more realistic   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixlszwKVVP0   mafia 3 has a good story &amp; sound but the game content is a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥! look at mafia 2 why couldn't you just LOOK first before developing mafia 3!!    I7-6700K Turbo boosted 16gb ram  gtx 980 ti FTW  I7-6700K Turbo boosted 16gb ram  gtx 980 ti FTW  I7-6700K Turbo boosted 16gb ram  gtx 980 ti FTW   This is â¥â¥â¥â¥ING â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t !
12211	This game was not what it was hyped up to be. I had fun playing but it's not worth $60. Wait for a sale.
12212	AMD Phenom users beware, this game requires SSE 4.1 and 2K has yet to aknowledge the problem and say they are working on a fix for this. If you have ANY CPU that does not support SSE 4.1 you WILL crash on start-up of the game. DO NOT BUY unless 2K resolves this issue or until you upgrade to a newer CPU.
12213	Performance is awful. Not unplayable but definitely not desirable. 2K please fix. Will update review if it's fixed.
12214	This game has a great potential but the devs didn't want to use it.  This game is a lack of things!   CONS:   -Graphics (shadows are not good, police light awful, sunrise and sunset are too bright). It looks like an old game  -Glitch and bugs (some textures are awful)  -You can't change your outfit (It's not normal in a free roam game), eat, buy cars or sleep (like in Mafia II)    PRO:  -Old vehicles are beautiful  -Music is awesome !  -The plot is very good and interesting (It's good choice to set the game in the 60s)   I hope that this review will be read! The devs, if the want to improve the game, MUST add other things and improve graphics! In this state this game looks an alpha not a complete game!    
12215	Graphics are blurry and upscaled. The game crashed twice within the first 20 minutes and the fps lock doesn't make it any better either.
12216	At this time its a Major Disapointment! But its becoming the norm in the gaming industry. Mafia II was produced by 2K Czech' A great game'. Mafia III has added Hangar 13 to the developers pool. If this is a good thing I am failing to see it.  I want to love this game based on playing previous titles but I cant keep the game running long enough to do so.  No where in the awesome movie trailers does it say:   This game may fail to load This game may crash repeatedly This game is locked at 30 Fps This game has resolution issues This game is not ready to launch This game ' Fill in the blank'  Please pay us $59.99 so you can tell us whats wrong with our game that we failed to test for our selves. Actually we knew it was not ready but launched it anyway.   I know patches will come out and fix a majority of the issues and the game will be awesome eventually.
12217	How do you take such a great game franchise and â¥â¥â¥â¥ it up.Its easy, just take everything great about Mafia 2 and make sure you don't put it in Mafia 3.Oh yea, Make sure you release the game with crippled frame rates, Because you know PC gamers will love that.Not to mention game crashes,Lost game saves.  If all the cut scenes were done with the game engine.I have to ask,What game engine were you using,Because its sure as hell was not the one that I got.  Last but not least make absolutely sure the game is painfully repetitive.  Steam would not give a refund since it showed 4 hours of game play. Well Steam half an hour of crashes and the last crash I walked away from the pc not knowing it was still running in the background.It did run a half hour the first time I ran it before it started crashing.
12218	i tried to 100% this game but it failed to keep me hooked to the very end, which isnt a THAT bad of a thing. ever single quality of this game (driving, shooting, sneaking, ai) are all very OK, ASIDE from the story. the story if very very good but the game really makes you work for it by making repeditive side-mission-quality tasks part of the main story. if you want a really good story definatly pick this up during a sale. i cant recommend the story enough but everything else is holding it back so im not going to give it a thumbs up.
12219	Locking the framerate is bad enough, locking it as low as 30 FPS is even worse, but the move that ensures I'll never again pre-order a 2k game again was the fact that they refused to hand out advance copies to reviewers.  This shows a clear awareness that this was a serious problem that would affect pre-orders and sales in general, but rather than informing us about it before release, they did their best to conceal it and keep racking up pre-orders.  Acknowledging the problem and promising a fix is a good start, but the lack of an admission that they intentionally hid this, not to mention the lack of an apology, makes things crystal clear. This is an attempt to minimise refunds and salvage future sales, not an admission that they behaved poorly, or that they will learn a lesson and do better in the future.  This kind of unrepentant deceptive behaviour is unacceptable, and I for one will think long and hard before ever buying another 2k game, and definitely won't pre-order one again.
12220	Buy on sale. like 50%-70% off  You can't keep any car you find. Nothing to do besides the story poor graphics bad physics Repedetive gameplay  The lack of quality and repetitiveness of the game makes it sad and boring. i feel like i have to force myself to play the game, and i don't want to just go around and explore the open world because there isn't really anything to do. The level of detail and small extra features from mafia 2 are gone. The best thing about this game is probably the soundtrack.
12221	EDIT: This is not a complete review, as it focuses only on graphics. for me, for pc gaming, that is a prerequesite, that, if not met, does not require any further gameplay review, as I wouldnt play it. Good graphics and tweaking abilities are a prerequisite for a AAA Gaming experience imho.  --------  So, does NO ONE care that the resolution is upscaled?  That is not glitchy graphics, that is less resolution than advertised and less as seen in the 2015 gameplay vid. Again, like in Witcher 3.  That results in blurry graphics so that even a bit further away nothing appears really sharp, rather broken down in lines, blurs and undistinguishable shapes. (no fps issues for me i7-4770K, 16GB R, 970) This bluriness becomes most obvious with moving objects, like cars.  My native resolution would be 1920x1080.   Again, the RESOLUTION IS ONLY UPSCALED FROM 720p.  And that is why I cannot recommend to buy the game, because for me that is so off, so insulting as a PC Gamer that I cannot and cannot go past the first few turns in the first mission.  So, in all honesty, this isn't only an offer you cannot refuse, this is an offer you should definately refuse until they fix the resolution, graphics, fps and principal â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ porting.  Salut, madonna, what a disgrace! (If the boss only knew...)
12222	The game is locked at 30 FPS, which makes it UNPLAYABLE. It gave me a headache. The graphics look like crap. It renders at a lower resolution, looks like 720p upscaled. The textures terrible, very low quality. I get a lot of tearing. It lacks so many Options. Mafia 2 probably looks better in general. It sure not worth playing at this stage, nor does it worth the $60  I like the soundrack. I can't talk about the gameplay and the story since I can't play the game like this, it hurts my eyes.  The developer announced an patch coming this weekend to Fix the fps cap and some issues, I hope the game becomes playable after this. Also this game was developed by Hangar 13, and it's their FIRST game ever, I hope that they did not just fail.  I will change this review if the game gets fixed.  Update 10 Oct. 1st Patch: They removed the FPS cap and they fixed the 'blur'a bit. That's not enough, the graphics still look like shÎ¹t, these textures come from 2006, and the optimization is horrible (~30fps with GTX1060 at 1440p) and the is a truckload of bags, everywhere. It also crashes all the time. Also some of the game mechanism are garbage. You push a person and they instantly die. you hit someone, they instantly die. WTF?  This game was far away by READY when they released it. And they have no excuse since it was 4 years in development. They FAILED.  Edit 2: After playing a couple more hours, all I gotta say is that this game is so poor and bad made that can't be fixed.  Edit 3 (12 Nov 2016): After another update (5.8GB) the performance was improved just a little, the graphics are still garbage and the game is still the same garbage.  I doubt this will ever be fixed.
12223	  UPDATE SINCE THE ORIGINAL REVIEW... 30FPS Cap has been taken off, the game is a joy to play in 60 fps, I can only show respect those guys for listening to the consumers and reacting so fast with a 1.2GB patch, as well as the fps they apparently made some improvements, hopefully made some fixes about the blur that randomly appears on the screen, and the frame drops in certain areas... any other comments in the original review still remain my opinion except my comments on the 30 fps nonsense which obviously has been resolved)   The game has great potential, story starts off extremely strong and the story telling is very effective, gunplay and close combat feels personal and extremely satisfying, making you feel like a complete badass. Voice acting and lip sinking are absolutely top quality, HOWEVERRRRRRR.... I do not know who was in charge of the PC port, but they shall be forbidden from creating any video game content.... 30FPS Lock in 2016? To whistle at guards you have to press the 'DELETE' button? Who thought that was a good idea? Game randomly gets blury, and the contrast between colours can get real buggy during cutscenes or during fast driving...  My only criticism about the actual gameplay is the AI being more stupid than the Aliens in Colonial Marines...  The game itself in my opinion is pretty solid so far, a little bit repetetive but then again I have not played long enough into the story to find out if this is just a phase or if this is the core of the game, hopefully it is not, and there will be other type of missions, won't mention any mission types don't want to spoil anything.   At the moment as the game stands with this terribly awful PC port I'd rate it a 5/10... If and when these problems will be resolved and it would work as intended, with a decent PC port which we should hopefully be getting through patches and updates in the near future, only then with the solid gameplay would I give it a decent 8/10. As I said this game has potential to be really good, too bad that the PC port degrades it soooo much. But then again folks, maybe if the story turns out to be a dissapointment too, this rate could change too... We'll have to wait and see if 2K manages to get the patches out as soon as possible so that we can enjoy and finish the story at a much more comfortable 60FPS, and then we can look at the whole picture
12224	shocked and annoyed , 30fps !
12225	I believe that a patch is in order. Thirty frames per second in this day and age is really not acceptable anymore. I'll refrain from demanding a refund in a week time but if there's still no patch to fix some the performance issue, I won't wait a second longer. I mean, really? Expecting players to play a shooting game on 30FPS? Come on, guys. The grainy looking post-effect isn't something I'm particularly fond of either.
12226	So they fixed the issues that shouldn'tve been issues to begin with and I have actualy gotten some time in. Unfortunately the game is medicore at best. As many have pointed out it is repetitive and the open world is lacking substance. There just isnt much to do aside from killing people and taking over rackets and then killing a boss. That is literally the whole experience with nothing to entertain you in between. Also, you can see through â¥â¥â¥â¥ing walls. I dont use the feature but come on, is the gaming community that bad now that you are expected to have ESP hacks in the game at launch?  Anyways, I would get this game for no more than 20 bucks. The story is great, the voice acting is great, the idea and the world the game is set in are both great, but the gameplay just falls so short that I really don't want to keep playing even though I want to know what happens in the story.
12227	Excellent first 2hrs. Utterly dull and repetitive beyond that. Weird lighting, A.I. misbehaviors and poor car handleing. Repetitive mission structure, no small minigames or things to do in the world other than just killing constantly. This game is like a AAA 'Hatred' clone.   Shame, because that intro was just so good.
12228	A MASSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT.  To make it easy to comprehend how terrible this game is lets compare it Mafia 2.  Story:  In Mafia 2 you play as Vito, a man who became an Italian refugee before World War 2. As a poor family you became mixed up with bad people from an Italian mafia and eventually arrested and send to fight in WW2 as a soldier and translator, and after getting back because of your situation you were forced to continue with the criminal activity.  In Mafia 3 you are a black guy whose friends were killed and now you must take revenge!!!!!!  In all seriousness the story in Mafia 3 is terrible, they make you feel nothing for the character and only after 6 hours I already forgot the name of the characters that where killed in the beginning. The actual story missions are also terrible, you just do the same thing over and over again in different places on the map with an occasional cut scene thrown in. This brings me in on to my next point  Game mechanics:  This is a complete joke. In Mafia 2 you could do anything from tuning your cars to buying clothes to eating a sandwich from your fridge. In Mafia 3 there is absolutely nothing. Literally the gameplay consists of killing a guy, destroying his supplies and eventually killing a boss in that district. Thatâs it! Nothing else, you canât even change your clothing. It feels like the game is not finished, I canât even describe how little there is to do in this game.  Graphics:  I donât even know what to say in regards to this. So I will put it simply, Mafia 2 a game from 2010 is in fact graphically better than mafia 3 a 2016 game. In Mafia 2 there are working physics, better lighting, you can leave bullet holes in vehicles. And this is only a beginning. There are so many graphical issues with Mafia 3 I would spend all day just writing them down. But here are some one worst one's. Itâs SUPER blurry, like I canât even see the writing on the subtitles, sometimes the weather bugs out and all you see is shadows teleporting everywhere, sometimes the NPC's just disappear.  Controls:  Mafia 2 had decent controls. Mafia 3 is a console port so itâs terrible. If you have a controller I guess it would be fine, but for the love of god do not play this game with mouse a keyboard.  Conclusion:  Absolute waste of money, do not buy this 'game', itâs simply not finished. They removed features, downgraded graphics, made so many bugs I've lost count.  The issue's I have mentioned above are just a tip of the iceberg there are so many problems with this game I could write a book on this.  2/10 I would rather pay a dominatrix Â£30 to spank me, than purchase this game.  
12229	 Things I HATE with Mafia III:
12230	Since everyone else is talking about the technical issues with the game, let me begin with the problems with the actual design of Mafia 3, the things that really be can't be fixed.  At my current point in the game, its just 'Go to this racket, kill all the people steal all the money, tail this guy steal the money, do this little objective after killing all the people and stealing all the money, and then kill/team up with the guy that runs the racket' Did the developers not play Mafia 2? I'll give it to them, the intro was outstanding, and it really made me feel like this would live up to what Mafia 2 was like....but then it just became a generic open world game to me.  One thing that made Mafia 2 special was the 'pointless' things you could do, like getting drunk, opening and closing the hood/trunk of a car, and even turning lights on and off... this game has none of those details.  As of writing this review there is no character customisation, I know this is being added later on, but surely this kind of thing should be in the game, considering most people will have finished and been done with this game buy the time its here.   There doesn't seem to be proper car customisation in this game other than a few upgrades you can just buy from a generic upgrades menu (this menu is really dull and doesn't really feel imerssive at all).. where has that gone? that added hours of extra gameplay for me in Mafia 2 (Remember the Milk Truck?)  Leading on from those last two points. In Mafia 2 if you commited a crime there were several things that could happen, you could be fined, arrested, or shot at with either pistols/shotguns, or if you were even more wanted, machine guns. As well as that feature, there was a system that made you a wanted criminal, the Police could recognise your outfit and the vehicle you were driving, another feature completely ignored in this game.  Going on about cars again, I never really feels like you own a car (I havent gotten to the point where you seem to get lincolns car back) because you can't seem to store cars anywhere, there doesn't seem to be a garage system like in Mafia 2, it just feels like I am jumping from car to car (if not just walking because I don't want to deal with the police, because its not really fun in this comapred to Mafia 2)  The sound design feels a bit off as well, when in a vehicle it doesn't sound like the exhaust sounds are coming from the car itself.  The rear view mirror is just awful, get rid of it. All it shows is a partly rendered world behind you (that even if you look behind and render the world is still not rendered properly) I definetly don't remember it looking that bad in the trailers (the cars headlights don't even light up, but the beams of light are there). If the rendering in the mirrror is that bad, it makes me think they just nerfed the hell of it to try and ease performance issues (which are bad enough now as it is).  One thing that really got me going about Mafia 3, was the music, but even that falls flat. I have only played for 7.6 hours at this point (and not much of that has been in cars) and I am only hearing a few songs (Mafia 2 didn't have the biggest variety of music, but it felt more fleshed out than this does).    I have probably missed somethings, but I guess I will move onto the technical stuff.  The graphics on the highest settings look bad in a lot of the environment (sometimes worse than Mafia 2), some aspects in regards to player and NPC models is really good, but the world is really lacking.   I am getting a pretty poor framerate (980ti, 16gb, i6700k) at near max settings (had to turn off some of the post processing stuff entirely to even be able to stay above 30 in some states), If I can walk through Boston in Fallout 4 at a pretty high setting, and pretty much stay at 60 most of the time, but not in this game? you've got a problem.  The lighting is bugged to hell and just ruins the look of the game.  Its been fixed now, but F**k the 30fps limit.  I have so far only crashed once, but crashing once in 7 hours of play is still too much.   This technical stuff could have been easily fixed if they jsut delayed the game a bid, did they not listen to CD Projekt Red's reason for delaying The Witcher 3 again?    Overall, if you loved Mafia 2, and the style of game it was, this is most certainly NOT like it. The only real resemblence of Mafia 2 in this game is the name, and Vito being in it (and a few references here and there. The Story itself is interesting (I love the flashbacks and film clips), but the gameplay, and the world design let it down. If only the rest of the game was as interesting as the introduction, because the rest of it just feels rushed and done by an inexperienced team.  At the end of the day, if you were looking into this because you played previous itterations, I can't recomend this to you if you wanted a similar experience, I don't even think I can recommend it to someone who just wants to play and open world crime game... because its not even that good at that.   I am not even mad, just really dissapointed.   I just wish they got 2K Czech involved with the developement of this. 
12231	Personally i loved Mafia 2 but Mafia 3 really doesn't meet the mark it needs to.  Cons first:  1. Graphics for the most part don't look very good like sometimes the lighting is pretty off and it just has this wierd look for me that doesn't appeal to my eyes. Not everyone might agree but i just don't think it looks very good clouds don't look super good ethire. And if you wondering i play with everything maxed and 1080p, everything but ambient occlusion. 2. Cars are WAY to easy to drive like, drifting i found super easy and when turning it simulator it does make it harder, but it's still pretty easy. 3. Car Damage is terrible like slamming into things at 100km and the car has not a scratch while my hole front end should be â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up, it's kinda silly smashing into a wall and literally nothing changing about your car yet i've seen guys drive into sheds at lower speeds and there car spouts flames. 4. The sound system is really wierd, cars and cutscenes have great sounds but yet whens it raining i can't even here it like i should here the pitter patter of the rain on my car and roof tops, it really does add a personal feel of Immersion. Also guns while they sound alright don't sound to great and are pretty average. 5. Theres some glitches that happen now and then but there not to open but one big problems is the game is pretty repetitive where i'm at 6 hours in and i am already finding it to be flightly repetitive with simple go here shoot loot and do it again.  6. Even though visually it isn't to good looking i still get only 30-40 fps, you may think oh thats your computers fualt well i'm running a GTX 1060. Withcer 3 a game with a better draw distance and 100% much better graphics runs 60-70 fps solid almost all the time where here i never hit 50. It just isn't well optimized.  Ok the possitives:  1. The gun play is fun though with the repetitive nature of the game it can get boring is all around pretty solid, though there isn't a huge amount of guns to choose from it's still pretty solid. 2. Driving at leat on simulator is pretty solid though not to hard it does present some challenges. Gets you around pretty fast and is pretty fun for the most part. 3. The story seems to be going into a good place though only 6 hours in it is pretty interesting.\ 4. Cutscenes and voice acting is very good, faces look good and i just wish the game always sounded and looked as good as it does in the cut scenes.  Thats all i could think of i'm sure i'm missing quite a bit. Sorry for anything i misspelled my Grammar isn't the best.
12232	Don`t buy this game. Poor optimization and 30fps lock
12233	AAA+ title with 30 fps and other unoptimized sh*t on release date is not acceptable in 2016. we did not spend thousands of $ on our pcs just to play like this. so dissapointed. stop buying this crap. let the devs learn for once.
12234	Game is fun in the beginning but becomes pretty boring and repetitive after some hours...  The missions are always the same and dont change much. The only thing which motivates you is the story line, but its kinda hard to keep playing when doing the same things over and over again.   Graphics are good, but nothing special for 2016.  Atmosphere is good aswell.  Get this Game when its on sale, but dont bother buying it for the full price. It's simply not worth it.
12235	Was so hyped for this game, ended up dissapointed. The main flaw with this game is the waisted potential with the map. The map is so well done but they dont do â¥â¥â¥â¥ with it. Ontop of that this game plays exactly like Lord Of The Rings Shadows Of Mordor, you kill a lieutenant which leads to the capo in whatever district (like an orc general in LOTR), eventually when you kill all of the Capos you get to kill the main bad guy aaaand THE END! Hangar 13 destroyed this game on so many levels including the whole frame rate debacle which just showed that they were hiding the fact that they didn't attempt to make a PC port for this game.   Here's a sparknotes Review of Mafia III:  Pros:  -Gunplay -The driving -Dialouge -Historical Accuracy -Story cutscenes -One of the best if not the best soundtrack in a video game -Setting of new orleans (not the graphics)  Cons: -No SLI support -Mafia II argueably looks better than this game -Free Roam aspect of the game is waisted potential -Stealth mechanic is so broken -You can easily take out an area of oppenets with a silenced weapon -Horrific AI -Textures are capped at 30 frames still -you can break any traffic law known to mankind and the cops will just ignore you  Verdict: 6/10  Even if the performence issues got patched ( which shouldnt have to be patched) the game is still not worth $60 wait for a steam sale or get it for christmas. There are so many mistakes of sloppy game development here I can sit here for hours telling you things they messed up.
12236	After waiting for months for a decent game to come out I thought Mafia 3 would be the end to the boredom. How ever the game story is slow and the physics are just crap.  Ive now played 21 hours of this game as i thought it would get better the further i get into the story, i was wrong. For Lincoln being an ex SF he cant jump over walls that are clearly jumpable, he cant get up a small ledge from the water, as for the AI all you need to do is crouch (X) and litiarly walk up to an enemy in plain site he will see you but nor react and then strangle or punch him to death.   This game has every aspect of a good open world game but lack simple basic gameplay.  Very poor show.
12237	Pros: +Good car handling +Combat is alright +The Story is pretty well made +Responsive AI Combat(partly) Cons: -Repetative missions -Autosave tends to just not work -Police are oblivious unlike other Mafia games -Not much to do outside of missions -The clothing animation tends to mess up in cutscenes -The unlocks are pretty much useless -Story feels more like a anti-racism campaign with random regurtitated nostalgia from other Mafia games. Overall: The game is playable, but has nothing to do with Mafia, with annoying bugs and pretty useless unlocks, rushed, buggy animations and overall a disappointment.
12238	Terrible graphics, looks like a game from 2008. Terrible car physics. Mafia 2 was way better. Hangar13 wtf you doing??
12239	This is a nice game and all but it makes me miss the Mafia 2 game.This game has nothing to do with mafia 2 except a Vito old as â¥â¥â¥â¥. And yet i like the story.Worth if you want some kickass action but not if you want to see what happend at the end of mafia 2 story. The 2016 games has to learn what 'game series' is about. This is like a complet diferent game and it does NOT feel like mafia to me.
12240	My FAVORITE part of this game is when I hit play on the launcher and it crashes never ceases to amaze me, 10/10 game of the year thanks devs i'll never forgot this wonderful experience.
12241	Crashes all the time, fewer options to change graphics, doesn't work smooth on a decent system, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ blur effect. To those people who wrote the story: survived after being shot right in the face. Seriously? Shooting feels nice though. Driving - not that much of a difference comparing to mafia II, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ drifting with some nfs 2016 camera-angle effects.
12242	Game works fine, but a lot of stuff from other Mafias is missing: garages, clothes, police chaseing for speeding, limiter to car speed, indicators, manual gearbox.. You earn money, but have nothing to spend it for.. Thats basics when developing game! Sad to tell, but the game is average..
12243	This is a nice game and all but it makes me miss the Mafia 2 game.This game has nothing to do with mafia 2 except a Vito old as â¥â¥â¥â¥.

12244	My FAVORITE part of this game is when I hit play on the launcher and it crashes never ceases to amaze me, 10/10 game of the year thanks devs i'll never forgot this wonderful experience.
12245	The game won't even start.....
12246	the game is almost unplayable, bugs and other â¥â¥â¥â¥
12247	Extrtemely repetitive when you get into the main game. AI dumb as rocks. Cons are pretty much everything outside of the story. Optimisation is lacking. Fat minus for not sending out review copies.  Pros are the great main story, great characters, great style and voice acting.
12248	I had the day off and was waiting all day to play this. My excitement reaches its peek when it finally unlocks and I boot up the game..... to not make it past the splash screen. I try 20 more times with alternate settings, with no different results. Instant crash to desktop after the splash screen. Are you kidding me?!! AGAIN!! Another PC game that won't play at launch! I shouldn't even be surprised anymore. This seems to be the standard. I'm literally tearing up from rage right now! Why do I keep falling for this?
12249	really, REALLY sad I have to write this review as someone who thoroughly enjoyed Mafia 2 seeing Mafia 3 in this state is depressing.  First of all I'm not even going to mention the obvious flaws everyone is mentioning such as 30fps lock or the 720p textures.  But I am going to mention how horrible this game is to play visually.  In my short time playing the constant stuttering and bad lighting gave me a headache and hurt my eyes. Then for the icing on the cake the game randomly crashes on the opening mission and I am forced to ctrl+alt+delete out of the game, and I mean a complete crash too such as the whole game pausing, no modern AAA game should have those issues on a machine capable of playing this game on the max settings.  I was excited for this game and was a proud preorder customer of the deluxe edition because I was confident I would enjoy all the DLC as I did with Mafia 2. I paid Â£52.00 for this game and it is an unplayable mess.  This is truely disappointing. I am therefore doing something I didn't want or think I would do, refund my game.  until this game becomes enjoyable to play and not a headache inducing blurry piece of crap I won't be playing.  and as an added bonus to this review here is a nice bit of 'gameplay'.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXvezu8K5pk 
12250	So .. ... ... Mafia 3. Another by the books open world game.  Lets just call it like it is:  You can beat the game whistling behind crates. What a masterpiece! You take down the Mafia whistling behind crates since the ai is programmed by people who apparently thinks gamers are children who dont like a challenge. Press a for cover, arrow left for whistle and b for kill. Is this â¥â¥â¥â¥ what we want now? We have been brainwashed into thinking this is the norm for gaming. Since every open world game now have it. But its crap!  Seems like developers just go by a check box making these kinds of games: cover system for children - Check! Easy stealth with enemies who cant see or hear anything - Check! Open world busy stuff - Check! Poor ai - Check! Repetitive gameplay becuase gamers like busy work that will keep their brains in a loop of semi entertainment for hours!   The new word for reviews now: Addictive! This game is good because it is addictive! â¥â¥â¥â¥ off! Thats not a word to describe anything good. If a game is addictive, thats a bad thing. What they really mean to say is immersive, but they dont know any better. Dont blame them. Thats whats happens when games like this is made over and over. Boring repetitive easy gameplay. Then its easy to confuse words like addictive with real emmersive gameplay.   Perhabs its time to wake up and smell the â¥â¥â¥â¥ you are being fed. Because they can do better, but we dont demand better.   Btw. The story, characters and the world seems kinda cool and well made ^^
12251	Crashes all the time, fewer options to change graphics, doesn't work smooth on a decent system, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ blur effect. To those people who wrote the story: survived after being shot right in the face. Seriously? Shooting feels nice though. Driving - not that much of a difference comparing to mafia II, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ drifting with some nfs 2016 camera-angle effects.
12252	This is not a mafia game at all, it feels like you are some murderer wanting to kill  This game is just boring, I can't even get myself to play it anymore.  Go there, kill them, go back, and go and do it all over again until a boss arrives.  Now the story is meh, but my god is it a beautiful looking game.  now if you want a good mafia game, then play mafia 2 or 1.
12253	Nice work, capped at 30FPS, resolution and graphic bugs. 4 years development cycle and you guys come up with the idea to patch 60+FPS in after release? Good job  Edit: Story starts good but then... same â¥â¥â¥â¥ over and over
12254	Figured it would be better, Mafia 1 + 2 have more features
12255	Dont know why they release a game that isnt finished.
12256	Crashes every 10-30 minutes. Poor graphics. Repetitive missions / lack of ambition-creativity. Glitches everywhere.  Just No.
12257	Pros  - Soundtrack   Cons  - There is no mafia atmosphere  - Ugly low res textures in many places on max graphics  - Horrible shooting mechanics  - Driving controls are unrealistic.  - Game crashes   That game has no right to be called âMafiaâ. Real name for this trash is âNew Bordeaux Verminâ.
12258	Mafia 2 was great, Mafia 3 has gone donwhill. Boring history, gameplay the only positive thing was the soundtrack.
12259	I am enjoying the game, and the story is really nice, but the game is about 24 hours long, and the combat is the easiest thing ever. Not worth $60, although I would recommend it if it were less money.
12260	I used 44min not to play the game, but to try fix the graphical issues.. Blurry, lagging and an unfinished game.! requested for refund..

12263	GOODS : Good music  : Interesting story  : Great setting  : Donovan is hella funny  : Get to kill racist â¥â¥â¥ holes  BADS : Bad Graphics  : Repetitive side quest  : Glitches/Crashes  : No customization  : Bad AI  : Doesn't have interaction with objects and people like mafia 2  : Must have vsyn on without it there will be screen tears  : No fast travel  : Not so good optimization   : Fps drops (Without Vsyn)
12264	Game is unplayable. 30fps lock, stuttering, 2x crashed after a few minutes. I would wait for some patch to fix this.  **updated**:  Updated to latest patch. Game still randomly crashing (first time after 7min. in). 30fps is gone but performance is very poor still. It is just a very bad port. Not recommended to buy at this time and for sure not for full price.  If they can fix the main game maybe but actually its too late. Move on guys nothing to see here.
12265	A combination of this game, no man's sky and homefront: the revolution, taught me not to trust a damn thing the devs showcase before the release of their game and to not trust games that have no review codes.  My biggest grudge is the all of this terrible visuals on a triple A title. It's riddled with visual bugs from the sky to the shadows and the awful draw distance and half the time the visuals don't fully render unless you look from the right angle, and even when you do, it's still poo-poo quality. There is a magnitude of bugs and the crappy AI just put a nail in it's coffin.  The driving is fun in this game and the frame rate is OK for me (80fps @ 1440p with a 1080) but I wouldn't say it's the same for everyone. (especially considering it has worse textures that GTA V which was released 3 years ago).  This game will get repetetive after ~ 2 hours or so. All the tasks are generally the same with little plot difference, go in, try to be stealthy or not, kill everyone, destroy everything, interrogate some guy and either recruit him or kill him. It's practically the opposite of mafia 2 was, where mafia 2 had little to do outside of missions, this game is a lot of repetetive mandatory stuff outside story that give you no satisfaction or addition to story. The story itself isn't any good either, it's something you see from miles away, you already know what's gonna happen so after a while, there's no urge to see it through either.  There's one good thing about the story though, and that's the way you treat your underbosses and the multiple 'after endings'. (ending is still kill sal, you'll make choices as to what happens after though). You can split everything even between bosses, make one or two feel alienated and give all power to the other two/ one guy that is your fav or you can just screw all of em over and keep everything for yourself. So at the end you come to these choices (spoilers)    endings are rule together, rule alone or leave the city..... the 3rd option leaves whoever has most earn to run the city.   There's also side missions (underboss loyality missions) that you can do to learn more about them. For example what happened to Joe explained by Vito.  There are few strong point to this game, one of which is the somewhat accurate description of racisim in that time period, something that you can see today as well. The soundtrack is also pretty good and the world looks really good (in terms of design). The textures of buildings actually render ok, it's everything else that is awful. Listening to the in car radio talk about the current events or some dude rambling is pretty fun too, but it only has 1 station and gets repetetive after a while (especially since by the 4th hour you've heard every song 10 times over). The voice acting and facial animations are also pretty solid, let down by textures and bugs however. Now all this being said, it does not justify piracy, if you want to pirate it, watch a youtube playthrough/game movie instead. People still worked on this pile of crap, the overall result might not be satisfactory, but it doesn't justify piracy. I say that because i'm an artist and I understand this stuff. The polishing team didn't do their job, but there were still people who voice acted, animators, concept artists and so more that did their job.  If you really want it, grab it at 50%-75% off.
12266	ive played about 18 hours so far and its boring as hell. Why can't I buy clothes? Why can't I go to a car dealer and buy cars? Why don't the police mind me speeding? Why is the entire police system a downgrade from mafia 2? Why are the lockpick mechanics a step down from mafia 2? What happend to the licenseplate system? Why can't I buy a safehouse? loved mafi 2,dont really like mafia so far 
12267	The atmosphere, storyline, voice acting and the soundtrack to the game are strong points but this is let down by the technical issues and repetition. There is little variety in the mission content, you take over territories in a typical open world manner without a variety of enemies. The gunfights are fluid but the gameplay is let down by the repetitive stealth mechanic in the game. Overall, Mafia III does not offer enough content for a large open world game and the lack of mission variety, enemies and activities is not up to the standard that you would expect from a major title in 2016.  The main protagonist can see through walls with an X-Ray abiliity and this is highly unrealistic for a game based in the 1960's. The user interface doesn't suit a historial period piece at all, it is very patronising and it even indicates what button to press to open a car door. This would be acceptable in a Batman game but Mafia III is a gritty, realistic third person shooter set in the past and the user interface and the superpower ability detracts from the immersion.  The game would receive a recommendation as not many single player games in 2016 have offered such a high quality of story and voice acting but that could change with Dishonoured 2 coming out next month. The lack of polish with the graphics, technical issues and the repetition prevent this game from reaching the heights of previous Mafia titles.
12268	Worst pc port ever made.
12269	30fps, shadows pop in, detail pop in, lod, distance view, fog, low quality reflections, upscaled textures, no proper ultrawide support, lots of bugs and unfinished stuff, poor port. My GTX1080 is at 70% at times- WTF? This is the last retail boxed game I buy. From now on only steam so I can refund it.
12270	Awful in every way except for the story.  Horrible optimization, blurry graphics with low-res textures all over the place, no attention to details, empty 'open world', dumb game mechanics and ridiculously bad AI, terrible driving simulation.  I didn't like Mafia 2 all that much (great open world potential wasted on linear gameplay), but the Mafia III is just a huge step in a wrong direction.  Uninstalled after &lt; 1 hr.
12271	Game is currently very broken :(  Huge disappointment because has I was really looking forward to this title. When they uncapped the FR from 30 performance was poor on my GTX 970 with dips and glitches.  I had been enjoying the story and gameplay, but now it crashes on launch so I can't even play D:  Don't buy this game just yet!     
12272	Well what can you say that already has not been said.  This game is a mess that could have been something much much better.  The game is very and I mean very repetetive with capturing districs by talking to someone, interrogate some people, kill some people and boxes and such then you kill or recruit the district's boss and so on till the end of the game. If that is repetetive as hell then I don't know what is.  As the story missions though some of them are quite unique and others feel kinda meh.  If they put more thought into the story missions and changed the way you capture districs it would have been a different story.  The gameplay feels okay i guess, I went the stealth path which is pretty satisfying from my experience.  The graphics are... well... I played the game when it just release so... there were issues. The game looked bad on high settings, there was an FPS cap to 30 (now fixed) and it just didn't that great of a game. It had a lot of bugs and if they only worked on the game more and polished it, it would look better and run better.  The story was a good old fashioned revenge story, Linclon as a character was this big badass guy who won't let anyone stop him and the other characters were entertaining as well and great voice overs. The district missions kind of distracted me from the story but the story was good in my opinion.  Lastly if you're buy the game you are gonna get either bored or have fun killing people in different places.  And also buy it on sale aint worth 60 dollars.(20 dollars sure)
12273	only real mafia fans would under stand
12274	Save your money, game is boring and easy.
12275	  Got this as a birthday gift, I....was pretty syked. I get to be swol as â¥â¥â¥â¥ angry black man. It got repetitive EXTREMELY fast. ( Played it cause Vito+ I miss Joe Barbaro.) I really avoided any type of spoilers etc. And I have to admit it's a MASSIVE change to Mafia 2. Plus I was gifted with the curse of IGN, water is glitched beyond â¥â¥â¥â¥ and Cassandra is a poor as â¥â¥â¥â¥ head with no real â¥â¥â¥â¥ to give me. Cause lol.  Example-  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqvHQOEsods   IGN would have a field day with you Hangar 13. Just wait till it's like 20-30 bucks.
12276	The Game has many potentials but in the end it's unplayable at all many glitches, stupid AI, repetetive missions with long driving distances, textures is a mess, day and night cycles are going crazy and finally controllers not supported only xbox one doing fine and any other controller won't work.  what drives me angry is that how could they have noticed all these and still released it!!!
12277	What a great game - the story it captures the life of the mafia, it shows friendship - it shows horror - it shows beauty Mafia 2 is the one and only game I'll continue to replay until I die.... Now time for mafia 3. SET! in a downgraded new orleans filled with rackets and rackets and rackets and one good mission every 5 hours into the game, This game captures everything like the constant blur to the lovely wallpaper in the distance and what else but the skybox that litterally lights on fire at some points in the game.  LOL - Call of duty have been killing there games????? At least they produce the same thing over and over if 2k did that they may have had a good game here - I COULDN'T REFUND BECAUSE THE INTRO TO THE GAME IS LONGER THEN 4 HOURS GG.  I never normally pre order a game and this is why.
12278	The story may be ok, B-U-T:  - 30 FPS, you â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ kidding me?! - the graphics are not really as good as they should be - the controls are really bad on PC - the they tried to copied watch dogs and gta too much - I turned the music volume to 0 and the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game is playing music in a lot of scenes, wtf guys!  This is a bad, bad console port! Keep your PC version or do it right!  I regret the purchase, really I do, I should have bought Witcher 3 GOTY or just enjoyed the GTA Online update....  Update Patch 1.01: - more FPS now, but the port is still bad programmed, that the performance is real bad - graphic is still not what everybody expected  I still ask everyone to: safe your money! Let's go and play the new GTAO Update!
12279	waited a long time for mafia III to come out and i got one word for it ----&gt; disappointment
12280	*This review is made after the 60 fps patch  Mafia 3 is one of the worst console to PC ports I've experienced in years. Other similar games such as GTA5, The Witcher 3, Mad Max, all look vastly superior visually and perform at a solid 60 fps @ 1400p w/ ultra settings, while mafia 3 flucuates wildly between 30-60 fps all the while looking like a last gen game with some of the worst textures I've seen since ps3 ports.  The controls suck. And the interface is ridiculously frustrating.   Only good thing about the game? A superb soundtrack. CCR is the greatest band of all time.  Bottom line: DON'T BUY MAFIA 3 (unless you are satisfied with driving around New Orleans listening to some great late 60's music and nothing else.)
12281	Boring game, buggy. Lot of crashes and repetitives mission. A real waste of money, once again â¥â¥â¥â¥ YOU 2k. This thing gets boring after 4 hours and there is no point to do the side missions...Really â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up stuff for 2016 game. â¥â¥â¥â¥
12282	Ive been waiting for the devs to release the smallest of dlcs to make the game enjoyable, if they cant add dlcs to fill in the the missing peices of Mafia 2 after almost 2 months, then its safe to say the game and title is â¥â¥â¥â¥. I really enjoyed Mafia 2 and bought this game thinking it would exceed my expectations but its just not there. Wasted 105$ on this game, im never buying a game made by hanger 13 again. Way to ruin what shouldve been GOTY.
12283	30FPS locked on PC in 2016 Graphics looks like GTA 4 from 2008 Game crashed after 30 minutes...  What a joke...
12284	30fps lock has been patched. The game still runs like a potato for almost everyone. Blurry textures, awful upscaling from 720p. And on top of all that i won't get a refund because it was bought through a retailer... Thank you Hangar 13 for ruining a good Video game franchise.   Don't buy this crap. These developers are FAR from competent!
12285	Just finished the main story line without skipping any cutscenes in roughly 27 hours. Kinda feels like playing an updated version of The Godfather II.  Cut-scenes and voice acting are amazing, but the game get's a bit dull after taking over five rackets. Also lacks customization features like most other games in this genre and the previous Mafia (II). I felt rather dirty wearing the same uniform for 27 hours!   It feels like the team has delivered a 'half' product. Earlier today I read their new announcement of what free content will be added in the coming months.. Luckily it's for free, but unfortunately it'll also be too late.  If you are a Mafia fan this game comes highly recommended, however for the average gamer I would suggest to wait a bit and get it when the price comes down. Therefore I do not recommend this game at the moment, there are better ways to spend 50+ dollars instead of buying half a game.  After the recent updates it's still not worth the money.
12286	------------------------- review 1.03 ------------------------- good: - i can play it now without crashing at start - little less blurry - added new outfits - seriously? look at GTA 5 and their 'outfits' and then call this an 'improvement'  bad: - still no (Steam) Controller fix - slappy performance  Still not recomended for that price, if you want to buy it then wait until it gets 20e or less ------------------------- review 1.02 (hotfix?) ------------------------- well... game wont even run now, it crashes at 2K logo screen...   this. is. just. sad. story.  ------------------------- review 1.01 ------------------------- this review is written after patch 1.01 and updated after a few hours of chillin, because i was in killing rage mode. who would blame me, i throw friggin 80 euros in the wind.  gone with the wind, right? welcome to the 2006. why 2006, you mean 2016?! nope. wtf then? ill tell you good and bad stuff.  bad first: - textures are like from previous decade - video resolution is upscaled from 720p - blurry graphic - some kind of (magic?) annoying orange filter - poor optimization - keyboard keybinds are a joke, man who binds 'DELETE' key for anything?! and here is for w histle lol - ai is dumb like a hell, probably have some connection with aliens from collonial marines; they would do great duet together - video and sound settings are almost basic, no advanced stuff or something like that; thats too bad because soundtrack is over the top - no fooooking controller support! you cant even bind your own keys nor export other controller configs.. just broken af - console port - WHERE THE FOOK IS JOE, DAMMNIT?! - i started to add 'BOY' into my sentences -.-  good: - story seems interesting, from what i saw - gunplay is okay, but still ai is braindamaged - soundtrack is amazing, probably best thing in a game - i kinda like this setting in new orleans and all that stuff about 'black mafia', racism etc - you can kill KKK, hell yeah - youre not rambo and cant carry XYZ weapons, you can carry only 2 which is realistic - bill-ray was a preachers son, but i still didnt meet him... maybe 'ol gator ate him?  conclusion: game is broken, thats a fact. they shouldnt release it like this because game in this state is a shame for a whole mafia series. IF (and a big one) they fix all that crap which is broken (hmm, wonder how long will take them to do it) grame will be pretty much amazing, but we will see and time will tell.  and yes, im still heartbroken because my controller doesnt work here.  ------------------------- review 1.0 ------------------------- i give them chance to fix what was missing after release, but they dont care about us, pc players. game is still in state like it was before patch, only fps lock is removed. on store page it says 'full controller support', and my steam controller dont have any presets available!! worst thing is that i cant even bind keys for controller! f-uck this!  i DONT recommend this game, f-uck preorder, f-uck 2k (and ubisoft too); im not gonna preorder their s-hit anymore.  im done here guys, if you are smart enough dont buy this until they fix all mandatory stuff!
12287	First time in years that a game does not even start after clicking on the exe.file ...... AMD Card with latest drivers and latest Windows 10. There is no error, no notification or whatsoever, it simply loading for a couple of seconds and stops right after it. Latest patch is installed.  The devs should really be ashamed of providing this piece of software â¥â¥â¥â¥ to PC-Gaming....  Edit: It seems that it is due to the fact that AMD Phenom II CPUs are not supported by the current version of the game.... All other mordern games run fine with my system set-up, but a modest current-gen console port like this is not supposed to work. I really hope that the devs will fix this.  Question: Was any PhenomII user out there able to start this game somehow?
12288	More like belongs in the trash
12289	The game looks ugly, the performance is â¥â¥â¥â¥ and the gameplay is repetitive. Huge disappointment of a game even though the story and characters showed alot of promise.
12290	At this stage I would not recommend this game. Even after 30fps patch you barely get 50fps. Blurry graphics. Weird glow around the edges of the car and characters during day time. Blurry faces. Its just a mess to look at.  BUT, on the other hand, Great gameply, Stunning soundtraks, and Amazing storyline is what's keeping me playing.   
12291	Agreed with many other users posts, that being; game is unacceptable and needs work. I shouldn't be crashing randomly 20 minutes into the game. I could handle the 30 FPS limit if they game was stable at the moment. That being said, my personal experience with this game ... not happy. I've read a few other posts where individuals mentioned they were unhappy with the graphics; I also concur. More or less, game looks washed, grainy, outdated, etc. Yes, I agree a good storyline makes a game. We've all played games where the story kept us entertained rather then the graphics, sound, or even the gameplay for the matter. However, this is 2016 and the bar has been raised for console and PC gameing alike. Not complaining, demanding, or pointing fingers. Just not understanding how all us PC gamers have to wait and cross our fingers to hope everything will work right. First Forza probelms, now Mafia III probelms. Let me guess, Gears 4 ... problems? Just saying....ok, I'm done.
12292	wtf did they do to mafia?   bugged af  game crashes insulting graphics 30 fps lock wtf?   
12293	looks terrible, mafia 1 had better graphics
12294	Mafia 3.... is just bad  grafics has not improved, since mafia II A.I is just so bad, cops dont care anymore and AI driving is just stupid the world of mafia 3 is just boring not living at all, 100 shops in the game but nothing to buy Missions are just repeatable, same mission different area everything is done by the 'Middle mouse' no garage, no gun shop...  Im so disappointed of this game and what they did to this franchise.
12295	I have a GTX 1060 and even on low settings I can't get 60 fps all of the time. Also the stuttering is terrible. I wonder if the developers even played the game on lower end cards because you'll need a lot more then what the system requirements suggest to play this game. Mafia 3 is far from perfect, but I have been enjoying the story so far.
12296	This game is so poorly optimized for PC that it is unplayable, even with a really beefy PC it suffers from brutal FPS drops and constant microstuttering. Whatever graphical settings you use, the result is the same. Not one word about this from Hangar 13 either, so I would presume that the issues is not even on their fix list. Had I bought this in the Steam store, I would have asked for a refund after less than an hour of gameplay. DonÂ´t waste your money on this crappy excuse for a game.
12297	Excellent story line. Going strong till now. Environment has been captured perfectly. But awful PC optimazation. I don't know if the testers were drunk while testing but a lot of bugs. I won't recommend till those issues are fixed.
12298	Yes, I waited for the 30fps-unlock-patch, and I waited for the next one, still, my opinion didn't really change, and if, just got worse..because, it still runs like â¥â¥â¥â¥, performance is still bad (I just finished QB, looks awesome, runs nice), the weather looks terrible at times, and sometimes it switches between ugly rain and nasty sunshine in a second. overall not a pretty game. and the game itself is not very good either..is not just the performance..do you basically always the same, interogate, kill, destory, and begin again. the only really good thing about mafia 3 is the soundtrack, great selection of Soul, RnB, RnR. get the soundtrack, forget the game. 3/10
12299	While there are minor improvements to some of the overworld elements in Mafia II, overall this game is a huge step down in quality. It feels less like a Mafia game and more of a collect-a-thon similar to Assassins Creed, as well as having some of the most boring optional side missions I have ever played, leaving me struggling to stay awake. I guess that's where the difficulty is supposed to be found?
12300	I had to change my review. At first I did recommend it, It runs ok on my system. I have had 4 or 5 crashes in 20 hours of gameplay. Graphics look better when on a LOWER setting, yes LOWER. On high the reflections just ruin the look of the game. The AI have random moments of madness when driving and start driving around in circles, including the police. So if your driving fast down a road you don't see it coming and SMASH! As people have mentioned, I arrived at a optional mission last night after a 15 minute drive to find the truck I was supposed to be taking wasn't there. The game is really poorly optimized, It's far from finished. The story is great and loads to do but that is ruined by the bugs and graphics. The devs, release one patch to unlock FPS WHICH SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN LOCKED IN THE FIRST PLACE! Now....... well that's it. No info on next patch, no reply to anyone as far as I know. Looks like they are more interested in the other games they released recently. SO.... I would say, in it's current state It's not worth the money. Who knows when it will be fixed and good luck getting any support! POOR 2K!
12301	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing disgraceful  2/10
12302	This game intitally is very impressive, it slowly shrivels up into a piece of a â¥â¥â¥â¥ a couple hours in.
12303	This game is so poorly optimized for PC that it is unplayable, even with a really beefy PC it suffers from brutal FPS drops and constant microstuttering.

Mafia 3 is far from perfect, but I have been enjoying the story so far.
12305	hello,   I have played the game till the end, and i must say im a bit dissappointed. The story is cool, but for a game that is made in 2016 its bad because your doing the same thing over and over again. Just in a other district.   Buy the game when its in sale or much cheaper.
12306	Now, i wouldn't say that this is directly a bad GAME, but a truly horrible interpretation of a Mafia-game. There is almost nothing resembling it's predecessors, it's a disgrace to the loved series. It has no 'mafia feel', the era is poorly captivated, the streets look dead, and is nothing near what was expected from it. This - for me - was supposed to be the revival of the Mafia-series, the one that i've been a fan of ever since i layed my hands upon Mafia I. It disappointed me from the Mafia perspective in ever single way, i've uttered myself to play game for as long as i have, but no more. I've gotten an insight in what this game is trying to be, that's enough. I will be leaving out the technical quirks the game has, since there's a billion other reviews for that.  Hangar 13 made this game into a grindfest with a very uninteresting plot which featured next to nothing compelling. The plot (briefly summarized) is about a man named Lincoln, a Vietnam veteran coming home (they could've hit homerun with this story even though it's very generic). He finds himself lacking stuff to do and feels overall useless, so he joins a gang (I honestly don't remember the name of the gang, but it's the Italian counterpart of the Black mafia). He meet's up with the leader and they plot a heist, the italian's end up betraying him and the black mafia. Resulting in them all dying except Lincoln whom is now pumped with bloodlust and revenge. Sounds generic? Well, it unfortuantley is.  The game itself is okay, the gameplay is okay, very generic and all in all just completely O.K. nothing revolutionary. Never the less, the place where the game really shines is in it's cutscenes, oh my god are they good. They are infact revolutionary, i have never seen better. They have an immense attention to details in the characters face, and it's surroundings featuring some insane graphics in the cutscenes, but this is unfortunatley the only place the game really shows it's features to me. It's like two different worlds, there's the low polygon, poorly made player controlled world. Then there's the highly detailed cut-scene world. How did you possibly go so wrong Hangar 13? I feel I'm bored out of my mind with the same missions on repeat in each of the 9 districts the game is divided in, and it turns into this agonistic behaviour where the one grind tries to be better and stronger than the other grind. There's NO variation what so ever. Sure, you might be into this kind of thing where there's an openworld grind, but this is no storydriven game at all.   I find myself disheartened, uncompelled, disappointed and lost in faith for this game and it's future franchise (?). I hope so very dearly that the devs will find themselves wise enough to play through all the games, then come to the conclusion that they made a grave mistake in releasing this game as it is. May they create a new game that mends my sore eyes after playing this. May Mafia 4 be a better one than this. If not, the franchise will die and my faith in 2K will be lost.  3/10 coming from a Mafia fan.  5/10 coming from a gamer.
12307	The most repetitive game that i have ever played.  It's not a Mafia game, it's a freaking district take over simulator.
12308	The gunplay is good, the atmosphere is good and (mostly) authentic, and the story (so far 21 hours in) is reasonable. That was all the good things i have to say about Mafia 3. The graphics and driving mechanics are a huge step down from the (six years older!) predecessor, and the protagonist is amazingly even less relatable and interesting than was the case in Mafia 2. The idea with you having 'underbosses' to help you is good, but the execution is almost laughably bad, none of their bonuses really add anything, apart from the one you get when you originally acquire them, and leave no reason for you to care about which boss you choose. Naturally the game is far from reliable, with quite a few crashes straight to desktop, in seemingly random places, and even though the graphics are notably worse than Mafia 2, the game still has really bad problems with unstable, and generally poor, framerates. All of this is pushed in the background, however, when it comes to the missions. There is NO and that is _*NO*_ variation at all, in the missions after the introduction of the general mechanics of the game. Every single mission is: Drive to this highlighted place on the map, shoot everyone there, and pick up anything that grows green in your magical see-through-walls-vision. That's it. Nothing else. And even though this seems like a rather easy thing to manage, the game engine still manages to mess that up, repeatedly removing the icons from the map, never to be seen again (until you restart the game anyway), and the AI of enemies is beyond stupid, with them wading slowly towards the sound of me, completely oblivious to the ten dead bodies of their allies lying in the exact same spot, where i can just point my gun and wait for them. The design of the shooting galleries is rather bad as well, with virtually no levels that has more than one or two entrances, and almost no possibilities of playing a more stealthy approach.  All in all this game is on a level i expect from a â¬10 game from some backwater startup developer, who bit of more than they could chew, not a fully priced AAA-title from a company that has shown that could make superior games half a decade ago!  Avoid this game like the devil, until it's on sale dirt cheap, it's really not worth the price!
12309	Wouldve loved for this game to be good. But its missing SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO many things. What it does good is graphics, characters and the beginning of the story.  The city feels empty, theres nothing you can do or spend your money on, youre the don honcho and yet youre doing all the stuff that a lowlevel gangster would do, after a while its the same missions over and over again only different sites/scenes.  It has good ideas (the taking over the city part/revenge story/and underbosses) but it never fully catches that because it lacks so many things if it wants to be an open world. 
12310	This game gets boring pretty fast.
12311	I had such high hopes for this game. Boy was I disappointed! The story is good, but the missions are so repetative they feel like what most games would call side quests. I actually felt more engaged with No Mans Sky than I do with Mafia 3, thats how hollow and badly structured this game feels.
12312	Silky smooth 28 FPS simulator
12313	It's an ok game at best. Got no issues with the graphics, sound, gameplay, character design. If anything, the Story is great ( cutscenes, dialogue execution ) - the immersion experience is commendable - this is where your money is going.   I would like to recommend this game on full price, BUT the mission design killed it in as far as expectations from an AAA title. It's repetitive for the most part. Mafia II was definitely better in this aspect. There were many opportunities to design the missions with more variety but I didn't see that for M3.  I recommend this title only for when it's on sale, unless they do something drastic about the mission designs in the future.
12314	Alright, after playing the game for a few hours and getting into the gameplay i can now officially say that this game is 'OK'  Pros:  -The games story is amazing, phenomenal, even. -Time period is captured accturately and portrayed as it should be. -Soundtrack is awesome. -Gunplay is what i expected to be, somewhat modeled after mafia 2.  Now to the bad  Cons: -Consistant crashes, especially in the downtown area (every 30 minutes to an hour the game crashes, sometimes less) -Pop ins, this is a minor problem and can usually be ignored if aren't focusing on it. -Gameplay is somewhat repetetive, although it reminds me of godfather 2 which i actually liked. -Some serious lighting problems, although this can be rectified by downloading a shader (Still, something you shouldn't have to do with a so called 'triple A title') -Vito does not look like vito, like, at all.  I've been a serious fan of the mafia series since the first one, and had been patiently awaiting this game's release, but what i recieved for my 80$(CAD) was an unfinished mess. If more time had been allocated to this game and the release day pushed back it could have been better, the game has the poetential but just not the heart unlike mafia 2.
12315	Bought this game in preorder deluxe edition because of old love to Mafia 3. At release I was mad at 30fps lock , but decided to give it a try and look into this game as a whole not just by graphics. Thus I decided to write this now.   TL;DR   Don't buy it, game is worth 20$ for me not 50$.   Long version:   Graphics is a bit avarage. For a price of 50$ I expect something good, not excelent, but good. Story is intresting at start but after couple of hours it is dull and I stoped caring about protagonist, sidekicks or even villans. Immersion is top notch at begginig but after couple of hours I realised that I cannot interact with any occuring events (some people are being stoped by police) apart shoting them. Character progression, building own 'mafia' is boring. Its just simple give district to one of 3 sidekicks. Tried diffrent combination and as far as I can tell it does not make any diffrence who gets what. Some of side missions are cool and kept me enterteined. Collectibles do not grant You anything. Not even collecting music records opens new songs in radio. There is no benefit from doing it. From 4 first districts I've collected everything, even dig through trash (not true) and after realising it acomplish nothing I decided not to waste more time on it. I love how cinematics look and thats some of major plus for this game. Also voice acting is awesome. I like how enemies reacts to bullet impact. There is no melee combat what so ever. More about how bad this game is look on Youtube for Mafia 2 vs Mafia 3.   DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR FULL PRICE 
12316	Awful textures + crashes. Wait for them to fix this.
12317	This game gets boring pretty fast.
12318	Everything i loved about Mafia 2 was taken from the game &amp; swapped for a linear shooter experience, waste of your time &amp; money.   Final Score 5/10

12320	honestly this game looks awesome, but it gets â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up with 30 fps lock.  and another thing i noticed, you cant rotate your camera while driving, i mean you can do that with no gas pressed, otherwise your camera will be reseted to front ahead which is stupid  i dont recommend this game by now, since the stupid fps lock i might wanna change this review to positive but lets see
12321	i dont usually say anything on these forums.... but seriously please fix this laggy, buggy, pain in the â¥â¥â¥ that i spent 80.00 on already. This is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t!!!!
12322	Awful textures + crashes. Wait for them to fix this.
12323	This review is coming from a big fan of Mafia 2. I played Mafia 1 also but only once. I was really grabbed by the 2nd game in the series - the setting, the music, the story, the graphics even. All was very well done and with a thought.  Playing Mafia 3 is a disappointment. -The graphics are horrendous - they are like from a game from 10 years ago - there is a muddy filter applied on your screen. Whoever thought this is ok for 2016 is a challenged person. Thank God there is a custom graphics mod that makes the game look acceptable. If you decide to play this game, look for it: 'Nyclix's official colour correction reshade'. The thing that it cannot fix though is the draw distance. Stuff at a relatively near distance are a lot blurred. The day/night cycling is a joke too. It is like hitting a dark shadow wall when it becomes night. -The story as a concept sounds great and there are various cut scenes that are created professionally. However, playing through the story gets boring quick - for every district you have to do one and the same thing - go steal something at place A. Interrogate an informant at place B. After that you face the disctrict boss at one of the same places - A or B. That's about it. -Most of the Playboy pictures are the same from Mafia 2 :D There are some new collectibles with naked girls but they are drawn. -Speaking of collectibles - there is no achievement(s) for it. That's a real let down for an achievement hunter and this could have squeezed lots of extra hours of gameplay for some people. +The music is good as the previous (if you like such type of music), but they did not compose it so it is hard to mess that up. +A big plus of Mafia 3, especially compared to Mafia 2, is the gameplay length. However, this comes at the expense of quaility. At the time of writing I have played nearly 20 hours and I am not sure that I am nearing the end yet. The previous game could be completed easily in below 10 hours.  Conclusion Devs nowadays are trying too hard to make new game part of a successful series and they end up making it too different and with less features than the previous. There are lot of examples for this and Mafia 3 has become part of that group. Anyway, if you are a Mafia fan I would suggest first playing a few missions through alternative means and if you like it - buy the game then.
12324	OK, so it's 30+ hrs of gameplay and about 4hrs are truly fun, BUT where this game is good is the story. The post-credits cutscene is surely one of the best moments ever, but is this game worth buying? No! Don't! It's generic and is a bad GTA wannabe, but if they ever made a movie with this skill as they have their cutscenes we'd have another 'Goodfellas' 'Casino' and 'Donnie Brasco' all in one. Overall 6/10
12325	I really enjoy this game. I really do. The animations are beautiful. The cutscenes are beautiful. The car driving could be better, but at least its unique in its own way. The guns are so satisfying to use.  But. There's a ton of things about this game that disappoint. The textures are complete â¥â¥â¥â¥ on anything except priamary NPCs. Its embarrassing. It's like looking at the ground in vanilla Skyrim. It makes me want to throw up. You worked on this game for how long? This is what it looks like. â¥â¥â¥â¥.  The light is terrible anywhere outside. Everything is washed out and tries to cover up the terrible textures. Its also finicky and flashes around when turning the camera 180.  Also, your settings menu is really frustrating to use. I understand why you have an app launcher. You obviously couldnt figure out how to use an 'apply' function. Anytime I switch a setting, it immediately activates it. Going from windowed to fullscreen crashed the game twice. I have to play it in windowed because it wont started without glitching around at fullscreen. And seriously? No option for borderless windowed?  I enjoy the game. It works sometimes and I enjoy playing it. The story is amazing, so far. The gameplay is great. But these things that should be standard in a game on PC are missing. It makes the experience less than enjoyable. I cannot recommend this game.
12326	Alright, after playing the game for a few hours and getting into the gameplay i can now officially say that this game is 'OK'  Pros:  -The games story is amazing, phenomenal, even. -Time period is captured accturately and portrayed as it should be. -Soundtrack is awesome. -Gunplay is what i expected to be, somewhat modeled after mafia 2.  Now to the bad  Cons: -Consistant crashes, especially in the downtown area (every 30 minutes to an hour the game crashes, sometimes less) -Pop ins, this is a minor problem and can usually be ignored if aren't focusing on it. -Gameplay is somewhat repetetive, although it reminds me of godfather 2 which i actually liked. -Some serious lighting problems, although this can be rectified by downloading a shader (Still, something you shouldn't have to do with a so called 'triple A title') -Vito does not look like vito, like, at all.  I've been a serious fan of the mafia series since the first one, and had been patiently awaiting this game's release, but what i recieved for my 80$(CAD) was an unfinished mess. If more time had been allocated to this game and the release day pushed back it could have been better, the game has the poetential but just not the heart unlike mafia 2.
12327	honestly this game looks awesome, but it gets â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up with 30 fps lock.  and another thing i noticed, you cant rotate your camera while driving, i mean you can do that with no gas pressed, otherwise your camera will be reseted to front ahead which is stupid  i dont recommend this game by now, since the stupid fps lock i might wanna change this review to positive but lets see
12328	First few hours of gameplay seem promising, but had to stop due to how rubbish the graphics are at the moment. They should have not bothered releasing it until it was ready for PC
12329	ARCADE! ARCADE! ARCADE! Lets the player down with hopeless combat, driving and stealth  Unbelievable that they cannot come up with a game as good as the first mafia all those years ago  REFUND! REFUND! REFUND!  Waiting for Mafia 4...
12330	This game... Been looking out for this game for so long. When its finally here, i cant say anything other then its a big disapointment. 30fps, crashes, frame drops etc.  I hope this will get fixed soon otherwise its just a wasted 50 euros.
12331	Ok so basically these companies don't want us to play games on pc anymore? They all want us to buy a console? Thats the conclusion I have come to after the last couple of years worth of games that run and look great on console but then look and run like crap on pc. Well the videos and screenshots look GLORIOUS but then we play and think... I waited for this...? Oh and I need to have a pc rig that is worth (roughly) $2000 compared to a $500 console to run the game smoothly and actually play it? AND it doesnt even really look much better... How does that make any sense guys... As a fan of games and pc's this is just downright depressing. Not just this game, but so many other games as well are not seeming to care about pc users very much if at all. Perhaps a minimum amount of caring to squeeze peoples wallets but thats about it?  Man I'm done with any hype for any game. Never pre-ordering again. Never looking at another gameplay video before the game exists. The pc game market is failing horribly imo too much just lately, although there have been a few gems, so many AAA titles over the last year have just been outright disappointing and overhyped. Then add the dlc factor and tbh it makes me wish I didn't even play games. Look at what they are doing with hitman, we are like guinea pigs now they just want to see how much they can get away with? I feel like a person who has been hooked by a dealer on some really strong stuff, and now that they have me hooked they just want to sell me poor quality and less weight like I'm some slave sucker to thier product. Sadest part is there is probably some great moments in these games and genuine quality but how can I enjoy it when I'm so distracted by massive technical fails and this general philosophy these games companies seem to have now of 'oh we don't need to optimise our code just buy a more powerful pc and horsepower your way through'... no man, just no. I'm not falling for it ok. And no just enabling over 30 fps isnt going to fix the performance or visuals... so don't bother replying and tell me to wait for a over 30fps patch ok? Thats not going to mean anything to me when i get 20 fps in lowest settings on this game on a rig that runs gta 5 at 60+ mostly on high settings, and does this game look better than gta 5... nope.  I know this isn't the place for talking about other games, but this is my review/rant, noone is paying me like others get paid to write favorable reviews... so i will write what i damn well please. Don't like it steam? Ok then delete my reviews like you have done before. It's all about damage control anyway these days with these forums etc, you might think they represent freedom of speech but they don't always if at all. It's freedom of speech until you say something the majority doesn't like, then you must stfu right steam/valve/negative reviewers who are probably mostly teams of devs voting to protect thier poor quality game... yeah well good luck with that guys have fun. /refunded.
12332	Very dissapointed, no 21:9 support, locked at 30 FPS and the graphics looks like they're also from 1968! Shame.  Refund for me...
12333	Wouldn't touch another game made by hanger 13. They ruined a perfectly good franchise by building a great setting and ruining it with run of the mill boring ubi-soft like gameplay. Allmost every mission is a sub par side quest you would ignore in any other title.
12334	Why is this a stealth game? Why does this game look like it came out in 2012, Why does the movement feel so awkward? It's boring with the stealth tactics, Doesnt feel like Mafia II the same animation over and over again knocking people out with your gun yeah yeah. And the AI is horrible this game isn't even finished. Now everyone nowadays is pulling a '' No Man's Sky '' Moral of the story; â¥â¥â¥â¥ game
12335	Really terrible port. Sound glitches, pop in, shader glitches - it's not good. All of this doesn't help the fact that the game has generally poor visuals; another downgrade from an impressive E3 demo. The 30fps isn't even an issue, it's all the other things wrong with this game. DO NOT BUY.
12336	total let down, wouldn't launch after install until i spent 2 hours on the internet looking for problem only to find i had to re-install the .net frameworks, looks like a playstation 2 game, cars pop in about 50 feet away, cut scenes look amazing then when gameplay starts they look like plasticine men, terrible console port with no effort whatsoever made to make it pc quality, the only saving grace is if i paid 55 pound for it on my PS4 i'd be even more hacked off.poor show 2K games poor show, stick to making sports titles where you can handle developing the simple content
12337	The game has a 30 fps lock which sucks but i can live with. if you play with a controller you dont see that much of a difference in game resonsose compared to a mouse. BUT if you use a mouse the game it self feels very slow, and fast mouse movements mean an ugly and unimmersive video.  So just play with a controller right? Wrong... If you play the game with a controller all help screens and tooltips just say something like this:  Press to Accelerate  instead of Press RB to Accesserate  Normaly i could live with that but i was litteraly lock in the first room for 5 min. because I did know how to open the god damn door
12338	Just buy Mafia 2 and enjoy a real Mafia setting. Huge let down, the graphics are sucky even at 1440p on high settings it looked meh. If the game looked like the screenshots and gameplay trailers it would have been a different story but my biggest let down was the graphics. The gameplay was wayyyyyyyyyyyyy better than Mafia 2 but I can't get over the fact that it looks like garbage even on high. Just going to enjoy my Mafia 2 Directors Cut.  *Refund approved*
12339	Watch Dogs in 60s
12340	This game... Been looking out for this game for so long. When its finally here, i cant say anything other then its a big disapointment. 30fps, crashes, frame drops etc.  I hope this will get fixed soon otherwise its just a wasted 50 euros.
12341	First few hours of gameplay seem promising, but had to stop due to how rubbish the graphics are at the moment. They should have not bothered releasing it until it was ready for PC
12342	ARCADE! ARCADE! ARCADE! Lets the player down with hopeless combat, driving and stealth  Unbelievable that they cannot come up with a game as good as the first mafia all those years ago  REFUND! REFUND! REFUND!  Waiting for Mafia 4...
12343	Technical mess. Avoid.
12344	COME ON 2K, YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!!!! Mafia 3 won't launch or start, it shows logo with 3 characters then it closes to the desktop, I AM RUNNING: AMD 6 CORE PHENOM II BLACK EDITION 1090T I HAVE 2 RADEON 6850 GRAPHIC CARDS RUNNING IN CROSSFIRE 24 GIGS OF RAM THIS SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO RUN MOST ANY GAME, IT RUNS MAFIA 2 WITH NO PROBLEMS ALL, I PAID FOR THE GAME AND SEASON PASS AND NOW I'M SCREWED, PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO SPEND ANOTHER $200.00+ JUST TO PLAY THIS GAME
12345	a ps1 game has better gfx, gameplay, less bugs...etc
12346	Still have not been able to play as the frame rate is slow and causes the game to run very poorley. was released at 00;00gmt and have not even played the first mission absoulty appalling. i payed for the digital deluxe edition for Â£52.99 i mean there was no problem with my money they happley took that.  There working on a patch no excuse for this mistake in the firsts place also no prelease for review becuse they knew it hurt there profit with the poor perforamce reveiw.  Any there laughing all the way to the bank at us.  POOR GAME RUBBISH
12347	Crashed within an hour of playing it, locked at 30fps, controls are annoying as hell as is the cover system.
12348	You have to do the same â¥â¥â¥â¥ over and over again, endless times.  drive there kil lhim, drive there and kill another one.  do that much damage in money to someone and kill him in the end, over and over again.  its kinda boring and repetetive, nothing special or anything. worst mafia so far
12349	mafia 3 made my friend quit streaming this game sucks balls
12350	massively disapoointed with this game might as well go back to mafia 2
12351	This is the type of game you would get for 10$ in a used gaming basket at Gamestop, wish there was more to it.
12352	A blurry mess locked at 30fps thats not how 2016 Pc Games should be released.
12353	WARNING!!! - Do not get this game. Its only strong suit is a great story, however it is wrapped around a very ok game. Gameplay wise, it's not that great, and plus a ton of glitches and awful graphics calibration problems.
12354	This game is... disappointingly bad.  All the hype and news about it made it look like such an incredible game, almost on par with GTA. In truth, the game is very limited, badly optimized, with very bad physics. The action is pretty static, the cinematics are boring quickly, the game doesn't feel very interactive, but more like a movie that you cannot alter in any way. The AI is terrible. The trees, grass, the texture is just bad. JUST BAD! The FPS rate is terrible, aka the optimizations are just so bad, my GTX 1080 can barely pull 80 FPS in this game. I run GTA V maxed out (a game which looks way better, even though it's almost 4 years old) at about 120 FPS maxed out, while this doesn't go past 80. What would the other people with low end PC parts do?  This is so lame, anticlimatic and disappointing it hurts.
12355	- The whole game is one huge 'kill - robe - kill' cycle - AI is as stupid as my younger nephew
12356	WARNING!!! - Do not get this game. Its only strong suit is a great story, however it is wrapped around a very ok game. Gameplay wise, it's not that great, and plus a ton of glitches and awful graphics calibration problems.
12357	Outdated graphics, lackluster gameplay, uninspired story.  The graphics are like a really bad painting. The gameplay is so repetitive I thought that I was dying of boredom. The story is cookiecutter â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t with a little bit of PTSD strewn in.   There is nothing to do apart from killing and looting people and then going to the next location to kill and loot people. The only interesting people are those you have to kill and I am sad to say that they ruined Vito Scarletta. He was such a badass character in Mafia 2 and even though he 'wakes up' when you recruit him, he remains such a miniscule side character they should have just left him out of this one.  2K games is the new EA games. Every game gets progressively worse. If I didn't have hope that it will improve I would have gladly returned it.  I know that they will include some stuff that might improve upon this pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥, like more weapons and outfits and including races and other side stuff, but that is too late. If you try to copy GTA do it well or not at all.

12359	I have tried many times to get into this game but i cant.The story is awful and it runs like Just cause 3.I'm also wondering when the actual 'mafia' come in to play in Mafia 3.The enemy is pretty much a mix of Jamaicans and a few MAYBE Italian guys who cant fight for their life.Just a boring game in general and i think it would be worth it for about 30-40 bucks NOT 80.
12360	Good story, voice acting and facial animations, shame about the rest.  Buy it when its on a sale Â£20 is a steal for this game.
12361	 DECEMBER 18th, 2016 UPDATE:
12362	Quests are really poorly made and boring.Entire game you are just destroying some cars/barrels to make bosses show up and kill them it is like a lame â¥â¥â¥ korean mmo but worse ... Next time if you see a hangar 13 game just stay away really.
12363	If Mafia 2 and GTA 5 had a incest baby then this would be it.  Great story and all but technically it is far from finished.
12364	Do you guys remember the horrible pc port for Batman Arkham Knight... Well Mafia 3 makes it even worse, 30FPS, not even better after the patch and even worse than that... some people like me cant even launch the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game no matter what, than a 'hotfix' came out and do you guys know what it did... IT FIXED BLURRY RENDERING... ARE YOU â¥â¥â¥â¥ING KIDDING ME!?!?
12365	I really enjoy the story so far. I wanted to wait till the glitches effect the story and besides missing a couple cut scenes and I only had it happen once. With all glitches a side I think this is a GREAT GAME and if it had a legit PC Port it would get an outstanding positive rating. But they don't give medals to runners that slip before the finish. In closing the PC Port sucks and this is what lets PC gamers play the game...

12367	30fps i feel sick.. but gameplay wise dont buy â¥â¥â¥â¥
12368	Low resolution, scaled from 720p, 30fps lock. If i wanted all of these, i would have bought a potato console :) FIX it for PC.
12369	Game unplayable on an i7 6700k and a 970 g1 fps stuttering from 3-30fps and game locked at 30fps.
12370	Dear Hangar 13,  Clearly you and I need to sit down and have a serious discussion about what constitutes Â£53 of video game.  See, I'm one of those 'play for the story and gameplay' types, I don't really care that much about fancy graphics and I can't see the difference between 30FPS and 60FPS. That's a category I'd comfortably fit in, given any other situation. However, if I stated I was the kind've person who ate ice cream all the time, you'd sensibly infer to be alive I must also eat other things. In this situation, my former claim must also be taken with an equal pinch of salt and the optical migraine that is this Â£53 pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥ is driving me mad. My intention was to file for a refund although since it's taken me 2 hours to play through the introduction of the game, apparently I am no longer eligible to do so. I suppose that would be my own fault for spending so much of it trying to figure out how to make the game playable in the menus.  I paid Â£53 in good faith based on the excellence that was Mafia 2. What you have delivered is a visual downgrade from Mafia 2. Hell, what you delivered is a visual downgrade from GTA: San Andreas! It looks like it belongs on a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ed PS2. This is not acceptable. To add insult to this injury, every few minutes there's a cutscene reminding me how beautiful the game was in the trailers, the end of which I'm forced to readjust my eyes, feel intense disappointment and continue through the objectives.  I simply cannot enjoy this. It's using none of my computer's capability, it's running at maximum settings yet it has about 20ft of draw distance. Anything less than 5ft away is a textural smear which would constitute a reasonable criticism of a Â£10 indie title.  Now, let's get started on this thing you've coded the camera to do while driving. So, car goes vroom vroom, wheels probably spin and stuff, can't really tell from the graphics, but I digress. You give me, the player, the capacity to make the metal box of vrooms move around. Why is it I'm not given the same capacity to control the camera in order to look where I'm bloody going? Why is it I am given the capacity to move the vehicle, yet I'm considered too irresponsible by your incompetant development team to aim my camera where I mean to look? Was it assumed that I would abuse the system and look around, having an unfair amount of spacial awareness in a singleplayer game or something?  To put this camera situation into perspective, some poor neckbeard in your studio has had to code a coroutine that runs every few seconds to initiate this cancer, then a lerp to move the camera smoothly back where it is of no â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ed use, plus any other bits and pieces in order to ensure it is as far from being a smooth, sensible or helpful thing as possible. What level of incompetancy do you have to be operating at to pay your employees to make your product worse?  Finally, the gunplay. I blitzed through Mafia 2 before this was released psyching myself up for what I assumed would be a better version. I'm intensely disappointed to encounter a combat system where solo enemies yell loudly to themselves about whether or not they can see me. While engaged in an active firefight, I duck behind a building to reload and by the time I move around the other side of it the enemies are either having discussion with themselves or eachother about how I'm probably not even there anymore. It's like gunfighting the developmentally disabled. I just wanna give these poor mentally challenged Haitans a hug. Perhaps not, I don't like being drooled on.  Next up, this inaccuracy thing needs to go to bed and not wake up. I'm supposedly playing as the most badass man in New Orleans here. If I, in real life, can consistently hit a man sized target 5 metres away with a handgun, why can't he? I would intensely like to gripe about a general lack of damage on certain things that should actually do damage, such as the M14, but I understand that lowering damage is a gameplay choice that perhaps makes gunfighting a little bit more accessible for the casuals. So, I'm not happy about that, I'd like a representative damage model for the guns ideally, but there's no way you can justify the need to empty magazine after magazine to kill a guy 5 metres away. Walking forward out of cover, up to the enemy to shoot him should not be the dominant combat strategy on the hardest difficulty level, which at the moment it very, very much is. (Otherwise you have no ammo and the enemy's still alive.)  So in a little over 2h of play I've been about as disappointed as this one time when I was a small child I left my cuddly cat toy on a plane when I came home from a holiday. That's a hell of a lot of first-world disappointment right there.  Â£53 for this unfinished mess is pretty terrible, but for the disappointment I should be legally entitled to forward you the bill for a professional therapist.
12371	IÂ´ve requested for a refund. 30 FPS cap is a joke. Game runs on 20 FPS in 4K all maxed out (PC: Xeon CPU, GTX 980Ti), so I assume it will be around 40-50 FPS in 1440p - even Batman:AK runs better.
12372	I will start my review by saying, I waited for this game for months, I love what they did with the previous games Mafia 1 and Mafia 2. WHAT THE â¥â¥â¥ ! In 2016 playing games on a $3K pc canât pass the 30fps limitation, not yet have to wait for the patch, few more days. They didnât think about it before the release or they want to make us feel the slanginess and low quality specs of a console? I wonder what makes them do that? I will not change my review even after the patch will fix this unacceptable first day experience with the game and that because is hard to believe is even happening.
12373	Mafia 2 is so much better then this â¥â¥â¥â¥!
12374	its not working it drops at being of game and doesnt install at the moment correctly
12375	Mafia 2 actually had better textures and ran better. And 30 Fps or 144 Fps still would'nt fix the Ps2 textures
12376	I really enjoy the story so far. I wanted to wait till the glitches effect the story and besides missing a couple cut scenes and I only had it happen once. With all glitches a side I think this is a GREAT GAME and if it had a legit PC Port it would get an outstanding positive rating. But they don't give medals to runners that slip before the finish. In closing the PC Port sucks and this is what lets PC gamers play the game...
12377	if your doing a stealth game then the AI is very very stupid in it. at one point i had close to 15 bodies stacked up near me and yet they still send 1 by 1 to get killed
12378	PROS: - First 3 hours of gameplay are really great and enjoyable. - America's 60s - New Orleans...ehm..Bordeaux - America's 60s - Soundtrack! - America's 60s - Cars!  CONS: - Pretty much everything else. (Story. Missions. AI. Repetitiveness of game mechanics. You name it.)  Let me be perfectly clear. It's NOT a bad game! It is just very poor Mafia game. Everyone who played 2 previous titles knows how story-centric these were. You simply can't remove storytelling from Mafia and expect that you will get away with it. Unfortunately, thats exactly how this game feels - like a sprinter who tries to run a marathon. First 3 hours of gameplay are a blast and then entire experience dies slowly. We already have a great sandbox game which does it very well - GTA. Mafia used to be open world story driven game and thats what players expected and didn't get. There is no reason pretending that Mafia is anywhere near to qualities of GTA 5 when it comes to variety of activities.  Result: Establish Czech development team again, hang budget cutting managers on the nearest tree and let former team do it properly. Unfortunately, Hangar 13 doesn't seem to have a clue about what original Mafia games really were about. If you really like America's 60s its worth a shot, though.
12379	This review is only here to say that they did fix the incompatibility for older cpus. That said, the game is bland, extremely poorly optimised (i get sub 25fps in the city with low-medium settings on a phenom II x6 and an r9 280 with 16gb ram.) Unless you can get it for $10 (like i did) then its not worth the purchase.
12380	1: Go to objective 2: Kill, interrogate, and/or destroy crates 3: Leave 4: Rinse and repeat until the game is over  The most fun I had was during the introduction; the missions actually felt unique from one another. After that, I can't remember any details of the missions that followed, because they were basically the same as the last one with a small change in scenery and a different cutscene. This game lacks a lot of the variety that Mafia II had. The story itself is pretty interesting, but it starts to become a pain having to force yourself through the same tedious missions to get to the cutscenes. Overall, it's OK. Not great, just OK.  Edit: I've gotten to a point that I can't finish the story. If I have to go to 'X' and kill 'Y' one more time, I'm going to kill myself.
12381	Boring as â¥â¥â¥â¥. DO NOT BUY
12382	don't you think this is quite too buggy for a great sequel o_O?  and lesson learned. after NMS I won't let 2hr policy cought me again.
12383	Final thoughts: Leave this genre to Rockstar please. If you're aiming for mediocre, why even bother making the game? There's only one reason: quick cash grab. This game will be added to the looooong list of forgotten, bland and boring titles that the industry spits out whenever the shareholders needs a quick cash injection.  ***  (1 hour) Good concept, but poorly executed. 5-6/10 so far. Will update.  ***  (10 hours) 5/10. The end. Well almost:  + I like the driving mechanics. It reminds me of GTA IV.  - Weak story - Very repetitive missions and side missions - Poor visuals - Poor physics - Forgettable characters  Unless you're on heavy medication, and like repetition, skip this one.
12384	If you don't feel like reading this entire thing, the long and short of it is that, as a VERY steadfast Mafia fan, this is not only a disservice to the series but to this style of open world game.  Throughout most of my playtime I was planning on keeping the tagline to this review, 'Mafia III isn't a BAD game, but...' However, after I spent more and more time with the game, I can no longer say it isn't a bad game. There are many factors that play into this and it's unfortunate that they are also the factors that comprise roughly ninety percent of the game.  First and foremost, many of the negative reviews on here mention repetition to an extreme degree. They're correct, though I wouldn't say the repetition is what kills it (after all, GTAV is a series of missions to drive a car somewhere and shoot people as well), but the fact that there's so little variation to the main gameplay loop. This consists of driving to a location of roughly a dozen enemies, getting out of your car, and killing them, all while also doing a few tiny extra things like destruction or interrogation. This wouldn't be so bad if they were more substantial or involved, but sadly they all take roughly a minute to do and then you have to drive around and do another exact copy of this same activity. It's extremely grating.  Beyond that, there's the driving. This is hands down, the absolute worst open world driving I've experienced in years. It's really two different parts that combine into a horrible whole. The first is the fact that the cars handle terribly. This is to be expected as it has been with the previous two Mafia games and the cars drive like the vehicles of the period would. But they seem to be worse off and harder to control than the older and lesser vehicles from the past two games. When you add on to this the second and FAR more egregious problem of how the environment handles these cars the experience is incredibly unpleasant. Nearly every object in the game, including bushes and small objects, act like solid concrete blocks that weigh more than your car. A light tap or grazing of anything will INSTANTLY stop your car dead in its tracks. Several smaller objects and the railroad tracks also have the ability to send your car flying literally thirty feet in the air while flipping end over end. This truly is the worst open world driving I've experienced in many, many years.  Another mark against the game is the AI. The previous two titles never had anything resembling good AI, but somehow in this one the NPCs have regressed in both combat and driving ability even further. The combat AI has a habit of either shooting from behind cover endlessly, or blindly charging past your cover. This leads to frustration in that the game was designed as a cover-based shooter and you weren't meant to have bullet-sponge enemies charging past you and shooting you in the back. The traffic AI is worse than usual open world fare, and the cop chases deserve special mention. The cop AI is tenacious and uses a system akin to GTAIV. You have a circle of intrigue where they will chase you and all you need to do is exit this circle to throw them off. Sadly, the game has a habit of spawning police cruisers DIRECTLY in front of you during a chase and have them ram you. This refreshes the circle, heavily damages your vehicle while bringing it to a dead stop, and allows the cars you were outrunning to catch up. They also have sniper-like accuracy while firing from a moving vehicle and routinely destroy your tires which ruins the car's already poor handling. Add to this the aforementioned issue with minor obstacles completely stopping your car and the chases are infinitely frustrating.  Beyond the design flaws are the technical ones. The game has MANY triggers or scripts that are easily and unintentionally broken. In the past five hours I played tonight I had a mission-centric NPC that was following me get locked out of the room we were supposed to enter (which broke a separate script) and left him unable to open doors for me to exit, I punched an NPC through a cage containing our fight which left him orbiting the ring outside unable to continue the fight, and had a mission-centric vehicle not register that I had gotten into it or that I blew it up in an attempt to reset it. The game will often spawn a copy of something inside of itself leading to cars suddenly and randomly exploding fifty feet into the air and a hilarious series of doppelgangers of your main cohorts in the storyline. This is in addition to the DOZENS of crashes I've had to endure while attempting to make progress in the game.  There is some good in this game. The main story, its missions, and the writing, dialog, and voice acting are all first rate and top notch. They're a return to Mafia form and these highlights almost make the game worth suffering through to get to. The visuals are fantastic and the lip syncing and facial expressions are deserving of extra praise. The gunplay feels fairly good though is still a step down from the previous two titles. It's probably the main saving grace of the game considering that the repetitive main gameplay loop relies on so much combat wherever you go. There's also a surprisingly functional stealth system included with the game as well.    The main problem with Mafia III is that the VAST majority of what it gives to you as its core gameplay is the exact same as the boring cleanup activities you'd do in any other open world game when you're working your way to 100%. Instead of being fun main missions or interesting things to do, you're stuck running from place to place to place quickly doing something and moving to the next one. Despite having a wealth of collectibles already in the game, the actual missions the game tasks you with feel like even more collecting, making the overall product a horrible slog that I can't find enough redeeming qualities in to make any sort of recommendation.
12385	  amazing game!!    Before the update i was running 25-30fps  But after the update my game started lagging and it if running at 10-13fps which makes the game unplayable
12386	Pretty big dissapointment for me as a fan of Mafia series. Mafia 1 stands as the best Mafia game in my opinion, followed by Mafia 2. Third installment is easily the worst. Unfortunately... Unstable framerate, bugs, average graphics, awful skybox, shallow and repetitive gameplay. One thing i need to give to Mafia 3 is superb story and outstanding voice-acting/lipsync.   5/10  (Recommendation: Buy it at lower price, if you wanna go through the story yourself. Something like 20/25 â¬)
12387	The game is fun to play, however, i have following concerns  1. FPS is still a problem after update, it comes to 35 - 40 from 60 at any point of time 2. Bikes or Bicycles not available in the game 3. Gameplay is almost same all the time 4. Textures are not sharp and blur is a a problem 5. Story is very confusing  Mafia 2 was much better  
12388	This game is a must buy for people who like boring, repetitive and poorly optimized games!!
12389	I loved mafia 2, but mafia 3 is terrible and a lasy creation  pros: cut scenes and music absolutely fantastic cons: gamplay overly repetitive and boring missions, graphics half ok with the sky from 2001 graphics, Ai do not react well, crappy open world with barely nothing to do, cash can only be spend on guns, fps (35-59) terrible even after patch, hardly mafia related game with no territory to defend, bugs and craches, car flying while driving, unrealistic fight, inaccurate guns,  this game is not worth to buy at full price 
12390	This is the most monotonously game i've ever played it is wasting 60 euros on a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game, i've never been so dissapointed over a game before in my life.
12391	Boring, repetitiv missions... wouldn't buy it again.
12392	For a story game, this is too fast paced, or maybe I was playing it too fast. The interface is very strange and the game isn't very optimized. I'm not willing to deal with the many problems this game has so I refunded it. Mafia 2 is so much better. I might buy it again at a much better sale price in the future because it is definitely not worth even 30% off
12393	Boring ugly game DONT buy this !!!!!!!!!!!!!
12394	 'facepalm'   I expected better from you 2K, SHAME... SHAME.  Day 1/2 Patch - Uncapped FPS from 30fps, but the game is poorly optimized and doesn't even keep 60fps no matter what settings you try..  4 Weeks later - 'Free Outfit DLC and New Patch'   Free Outfits?? Mafia 2 had a good selection of clothing / outfits did you like forget to look at your previous game? Or did you think people wouldn't care to get a game with 'Free Roam' but nothing to do in it at all?...  A lot of people are reporting that the game still performs very poorly with the new patch.  Side Notes -   Missions are very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very repetative  (did you see what I did there? lul)   Game randomly froze for me on the first mission, I had to work around a certain spot on the map to avoid the game crashing on me..   Visually the game is kinda bad for a game launched in 2016..    I normally like to put effort into my reviews, but I am taking a leaf out of this games 'book'.    * boop * 
12395	Get Mafia 2. This game is a disgrace to it's parents.
12396	Should have known is how best to some it up.   Basically we hoped for the best. Got some where just short of mediocre. Every Mission is the same, sometimes even the same part of the map again and again. Story is ok but same over and over.  Needs some thing to mix it up or a better conection with the characters.  Mafia, in its day great game and still one of the better modern/realistic storys around.  Mafia 2 good in its day, shame about the content that was left out in the release, story missions were a bit short but was an ok game to play.   Mafia 3, to me was only saved by the music. For an RPG, there is no way to customise your clothes through the game. Cant customise vehicles. This sort of thing is 'Coming' aparently.   The game is an incomlete mess really. Then why the â¥â¥â¥â¥ was it released and not delayed until complete and functional?
12397	Amazing game with a moving story and that feeling of sadness when the story is over. BUT so many bugs. and a few can be game breaking, progress halting, and pulling you away from the fun of the game with a bit of resentment. Most bugs can be fixed with just restarting from your previous checkpoint. BBBBBUUUUUUTTTT another common bug is when you try to go back and use that previous checkpoint, the game will throw you into an endless loading screen. Amazing game. I want everyone to play it. But i wouldnt want my worst enemy to have to endure the bugs that i did.   I HIGHLY RECOMMEND GETTING THIS GAME ON SALE
12398	First off, the fps lock at this game makes it a bit rough to play when being used to 60+ fps. The game runs pretty smooth but then the game starts to get random blotches that looks like it's in the game but it's a bug that covers appears everywhere.  Second, the lip syncing is awful. I kept losing sound repeattedly and I had to keep restarting the game for the voices to even match up. At one point, the voice sounds were so low, that turning up the speakers to max would only allow you to hear it in the distance.  Third, the game is just too easy. The AI is pretty bad. If there are two people speaking to another, just whistle and one will come to you, take him out and whistle for the other. It was kind of a joke after finding out how bad the AI was. I, even, shot everyone and got wanted. All you have to do is run in the bathroom of the store and the police would eventually call off the search.  I would not recommend this game. The sound doesn't bother me too much but with the game on being too easy, at least make it look good. The game doesn't look good at the same time it feels clunky. FPS locked at 30fps while I'm running 2x Nvidia 980ti.
12399	Mafia 2 is a far better game in almost every regard. Don't buy this unless its 60+% off. Trust me its bad.
12400	A few months ago No Manâs Sky sold like hotcakes despite the game being nothing like it was promised. Now Mafia III is 2Kâs fastest selling game despite being released in a deplorable state and with no fixing patches in sight, proving once again that in this industry everything that is advertised well will sell. Despite its numerous problems, there is a lot to like about this game, but keep in mind that it demands serious compromises to be fully enjoyed. Something must have gone really wrong at some point in the development and it can be seen in the discrepancy in quality of the gameâs content. Iâm no fan of conspiracy theories, but Iâm inclined to believe the rumor that there was some external meddling that tempered with the developerâs creativity. In the end, like the fans of this series, the story of Lincoln Clay deserves a better Mafia game, but I donât regret that Iâve seen this story even if it was part of an extremely flawed game.   Pros: + Good writing and excellent storytelling + Awesome characters + Impeccable voice acting + A great selection of 60s music + Satisfying shooting + Improved driving  Cons: - Missions design is repetitive - Grindy story progression - Average graphics at best - Poor performance - Questionable AI - A ton of bugs and visual glitches  Read the full review at:  http://thegameslashers.blogspot.ro/2016/11/mafia-iii-review.html 
12401	Cant even load the game! Crashes everytime on start up, looking online, so many other people have had the same problem
12402	So, as of this review I have played 1.8 hours of the game and I must say I am dissapointed.   After reading all the reviews, the possitive and negative, I wanted to see for my self what really is the status of the game, and if any of the negative reviews hold any merrit.   For starters, I had an audio bug that no matter how many restarts, and surround sound checks just seemed to not go away. I checked my audio with other games and no issues but for some reason Mafia III left me unable to either hear none or barely any dialogue. This was dialoge from cut scenes and from driving in cars. (pasenger audio). If I was on foot, I would hear audio when I would look in the vicinity of where the character was speaking, and as I looked away it became a distant quiet whisper and eventually nothing. Same applied to some car sounds, police sirens, and police radios.   I kept pushing through my play having to resort to the subtittles to gleam what was going on in the story which was quite frustrating.   Second from the audio but perhaps the most imersion breaking was that characters/vehicles on certain streets seemed to float one inch off the ground. The people nad the vehicles where like floating on one inch of air. This was quite imersion breaking and was just horrible. Now seemed to be more the brick tiled streets than the asphalt ones.   I did not experience any issues with lag, graphics or any of that. I did experience alot of cliping. It was a total clip fest, and if at any point your character ran into an npc that was on a designated walking path, your character would walk right through them. Verry odd.   The game mechanics of the combat and the shooting seemed fun. I turned off auto aim and that made shooting people in certain parts of their body more entertaining albeit you tend to miss alot more at further away targets as the cross hair circle is huge at anything further than 36 yards.   I might give this game another try after bugs are ironed out and the game is polished or dare I say finished but as of right now this seems like a product that was rushed, released before it was ready just to make it out the door before the bigger tittles coming this season.   Hope this helps those of you on the fence.
12403	Horrible console port. Minimal settings tweaks, textures look horrible. For a series born on the PC, this is completely disappointing. Not to mention, gone are the destructable environments from #2. I am requesting a refund and I will wait a few weeks and get it on GameFly. I had such high hopes for this game.
12404	i cant suport pc bad ports on release, please fix your game and then ill rebuy your game later
12405	One of the dullest games I've played for a long, long time.  There's nothing interesting about this game, it's very much a GTA clone that offers nothing new or exciting. After a promosing intro sequence which actually felt a lot like Mafia, it turns into a constant rinse and repeat cycle of the same missions over and over again.  Nothing about this game reminds me of Mafia 2, other than perhaps Vito being it it as a completely throwaway character, what happened to all the things like fueling your car up? Or changing the plates after being wanted? These quirks are what made Mafia 2 such a good game but they're entirely absent here. Even the option to change your outfit is omitted despite the fact that there are shops that you can walk inside of in the gameworld, essentially they serve no purpose what-so-ever.   I wish I realised how poor this game was before the chance to refund it expired. This is an average and lifeless Grand Theft Auto clone and the worst follow-up I could have envisioned. Save your money until its dirt cheap.
12406	5/10  Low res textures, bad lighting, pop-in and still stutters with unlocked framerates. Mafia II felt great for its time, this does not.  Specs:  i7-5820K GTX 980 16GB Mem
12407	GTA V has a lower requirement yet the game looks 10000000x times better. This game hurts my eyes. Garbage.
12408	game gets better with time but still not worth the price, maybe after a couple updates   i dont think they play tested this game for pc im starting to put this on steam  they continue to let these companies sell games through them that are not pc ready its really starting to be like what sears did in the 80s 'let anyone sell a game who cares if it works. we will offer refunds to people who give up in less then 2 hours. that way all fair' not a real quote  the last three games i bought were console games that were not ready for pc, and two hours is not enough time to tell if rpg sucks.  whats wrong: key binding to non-default will cause a crash, binding anything to B will crash it immediately, other binds will causes problems later.  the 30fps thing that is fix now was just dumb  the aim is terrible, if you play with aim assist on the bullets hit but usally in the body, aim assist off and shot will go where ever. there seems to be very few hit boxes, head shots always hit same spot.  update: after a while there is a lvl-up that increases accuracy of aim. seems kinda dumb when clay was special ops in veitnam.  the ai is just dumb. i know its hard to program, but this is bad cops dont pull you over they just shoot you. there is no progression from smal crime to big crime. it is very easy to evade police.  unlike other mafia games police do not care about traffic infrations.  the story is bad and i think they knew this that is why everything is a flash back, or some asshat having to explain it from the future.  some are proud of the way the racism is used. it seems to be a joke to me. cops call player names as they walk by, but dont pull over a black guy in a corvette.   there is one scene where the player breaks up a drug packing house and all the workers are the same mostly naked woman.   this game may be fun for kids playing on there console, it is not a game for pc players
12409	hi guys my experence with this game it sucked at first as i was getting crashes fps drops everything but i kept my kool and waited for that update unlike some peaple raging with the bad review becuase the game didnt come out as planed  i think they fixed most of the problems becuase i was able to get few the game with only a few minor problems  the strange thing is the game wouldnt even run on my old system with gtx 980 GPU  and 16Gb ram were it should off becuase my old computer is still a great system but it runs fine on my new system that i reccently upgraded to so that was wierd   GAMEPLAY! very very reapetive as alot of peaple are say its fun for the first few hours but gets same old same old the storey i thought was okay it wasnt bad and it wasnt amazing  the end content alfter youv completed the game well theres pretty much nothing else to do untill dlc comes out so that for me will be thought over if i wanna buy the dlc and i have no plans to buy the season pass as theyll proberly realease crappy dlc like some games i like to buy depending on if its worth it i dont like buying dlc that i dont even no what there gunna realease overall id say this game is worth your time but not at full price deffinlty not! it gets you in that feeling of when is the ending gunna come becuase its so same old so for all the bad points and very not much good points im going to give it a thumbs down  hope this can make up you guys minds to whoevers thinking of buying peace!
12410	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZokdmzvDGA   I think thats enough ...
12411	As of right now, do not buy. 30 fps, some mediocre textures, and so far is not like previous mafia games. It's an open world repeat-the-same-activity game.  Edit: 60 fps patch now (although I can't reach 60 fps because of optimazation), but I still have really bad buyer's remorse for purchasing this game due to the lack of diverse missions. I am on the fence as to whether I liked the game or not, because every time I did a copy-paste mission I would think 'What separates this game from every other title that does this?' then right after it plays a beautiful and well-acted cutscene with bits of story in it.   It is as if two or three separate teams developed this game and didn't communicate with each other...
12412	It's a disaster, refund incoming
12413	Game Breaking Bug after 38 hours into the Story, feels bad man!  I guess i wait until the game is patched before i begin my second try of a playthrough. So far i enjoyed this Game a lot and i will play it again for sure, but Mafia 3 has so many different Technical Issues, Bugs, Glitches that i cant recomend this Game in it`s current Version. FIX YOUR â¥â¥â¥â¥ ! A big cheer to the Authors who developed the Story and the Characters and a big â¥â¥â¥â¥ you to the QA
12414	As of right now, do not buy. 30 fps, some mediocre textures, and so far is not like previous mafia games. It's an open world repeat-the-same-activity game.  Edit: 60 fps patch now (although I can't reach 60 fps because of optimazation), but I still have really bad buyer's remorse for purchasing this game due to the lack of diverse missions.

It is as if two or three separate teams developed this game and didn't communicate with each other...
12415	This game was crap right from the beginning, I just couldn't finish it. Same side missions over and over and over again.Crashes too often, system requirements are wtf. Graphics are from 2006, my worst purchase I've ever made.Wish I could remove it from my games list, it's a disgrace to own this game
12416	After 26 hours: meh. It's not bad. It's just not good.   Performance: for me, personally, it's fine. It looks OK; water is very well done, some sunsets / rises look really good, lighting is solid without being anything new or exciting. Excessive glare from some lighting is annoying, but tolerable. The whole 30fps thing was a non-issue for me, so I'll stay out of that debate.   Story: starts well, (actually, started really well); deteriorates quickly until you soon realise you're playing Saints Row San Andreas Assassin's Creed 11: The Quest for More Money. This is a shameless cash grab, that becomes 'Drive to marked point, turn off irritating pop-up 'tip', kill everything conveniently marked in red, drive away' - which is really sad. It lacks innovation, polish and passion; it's just a rehash of every other 'open world' game you've played in the last several years. Frankly, I'm waiting for zombies to arrive: it's that derivative.   Music is really good, if you like 60's / 70's tunes, you'll be in heaven here. GREAT soundtrack. Not enough to redeem it, though, but really goes to show just how good this setting could've been.   It's just so... joyless. It's paint by numbers, without Bob Ross's soothing tones. It's just... bleh.   Case in point: physically wire-tapping a phone box marks enemies, magazines and electronic items on your map. Really? This is the level of design and innovation in AAA games now? Rehashing a mechanic that makes no diegetic sense for the simple sake of convenience.  Grab it on sale. Maybe. If you're bored. Really bored.
12417	30 Fps is this a joke, may as well play on Console. Not Recommend ATM.
12418	Great game, but plenty of gamebreaking bugs and that 30fps debacle...  Wait a few patches or untill its on sale.
12419	I was having fun with Mafia 3 before the patch even though it was locked to 30fps. I thought the patch would be a welcomed update because you could change the fps from 30 to 60 or unlocked but once I installed it I knew that this game had a long way to go. My pc is more than capable of handling this game at 60fps at max settings (I even turn aa to low in this game to reduce the blur) but yet it barely climbs over 35fps. So I changed the Reflection to low and it bumps up to 45-50fps. That 45-50fps isn't consistent either because it jumps all the time, so I changed everything to medium keeping reflection and aa at low and it makes it to 64fps but dips to the low 40s. So I changed everything to LOW. Now you would think the fps would be a very consistent 60. NOPE. the fps goes from the highest i saw 70 fps, to still 45fps. So i decided to lock the fps at 30 and play at ultra turning off aa and reflections to low. But that isn't even the most annoying thing yet. My game crashed twice, first time was from about an 1hr playing time I paused the game and unpaused it froze and crashed. Second time was when I went to shoot a box i clicked to shoot and boom CRASHED the game. I really want to enjoy this game which for the most part i was but then the game just ain't optimised and crashes so for now I'm saying POSITIVE for gameplay when it works and NEGATIVE for poor optimisation and crashes. 2k pls call Ubisoft, they want Assassin's Creed Unity back!
12420	30 FPS ... Enough said. Not playing the game in this fail state with 30 FPS.
12421	This is another great example of a developer releasing an unfinished game, releasing patches the day after launch, announcing DLC on an unfinished game. When will we stop supporting this rediculous practice. Why wont the UK/USA govt pass a law preventing these scammers from ripping us off. This game will never be finished, just like every other game 2K ever released. The story line is cool but the game play is pure trash. Physics are worse than the lego game for babies and the vehicles drive worse than gta 1. Dont buy this game for more than $15, wait for a sale in a year or so, or even better, take your money and spend it on a condom for the next time you get f***ed by a developer
12422	Hello,  personally i dont like this game. I was playing Mafia from the start but this part has nothing to do with the Mafia i know. It is more like a GTA with a Mafia-Mod. The Story doesnt allow you many options and is also not very boring. ' You killed my family, i kill you' Especially with this Racing and Customization Add-On it is nothing more like a cheap GTA copy.  I am really dissapointed and think for thos who loved the other Parts this will be also kinda strange. There is absolutely no Mafia-Feeling at all.  Regards
12423	If you like repetitive gameplay from beginning to end, this is your game! It should have stayed at 2K Czech... Mafia II was a GOTY and an award winning masterpiece compared to this bullsht.
12424	Maybe a good game, but you cannot get a good rating for releasing an unfinished product. Don't preorder from this company anymore.
12425	Tried playing it again after two months. Still runs, looks and plays like sh!t.
12426	I've got to give it to 2K Games, they YEETED the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of us, might've even done a better job than Ubisoft had done with The Division.  YEET/YEET would get YEETED again
12427	This title is very repetitive. You pretty much do the same thing about 20x. However, the story was somewhat good. The track list is amazing. I just wished there were more channels and tracks. I personally encountered two crashes throughout my playthrough. I also seen a few minor graphic bugs and glitches. Botton line as the game stands now. I cannot make a recommendation. For sure get it during a sale but not worth full price.
12428	Another AAA game where the PC (launch) version is a complete mess. I wish I could tell you how the game looks and plays, but I can't even get that far.  I have a 3440x1440 monitor (Acer Predator X34), the game even recognise the resolution, but everything's out of whack.  The initial loading screen is mangled. The 'Set display edges' screen was unworkable; I got through it by [ENTER]-ing blindly a couple of times. Once the start screen is up I go to the options ... options screen shows but there's no mouse cursor and I can't access any of the four options ... AND I CAN'T GET OUT OF THAT SCREEN ... I have to use TaskManager!  I tried to post this review, but I couldn't yet because I hadn't spend the minimum of 5 minutes with the game (fair enough). So I started the game, waited, and quit ... but the game didn't quit ... a hanged black screen ... so even her I needed Taskmanager to quit the 'game'.  Refund it is then.
12429	Today's Review: Mafia 3  Overview: My original thoughts about this game were very clear. First i know this could not match Mafia 1 and even less Mafia 2 (one of the best games i've ever played) but to turn the game into this? first the plot, the story is unconvincing, the gameplay is pretty much ok also the graphics are pretty nice and the soundtrack is amazing, but despite that the game is really shallow and repetitive and overall i'm gonna talk about 2k Shady way of doing bussiness lately.  Story: Mafia 3 sets in a fictional place called New Bordeaux (New Orleans), for Mafia 2 was Empire Bay (New York) and for Mafia 1 was Chicago. You play as Lincoln Clay, a boy raised by the black mob, orphan that at it's adult age joins the vietnam war and recieves the training to be a soldier, acording to the game a really good one, there's a minor spoiler here but everyone knows, after meeting Vito Scaletta (protagonist of Mafia 2) you get betrayed by Marconi and left to die in a fire, the game starts on a journey for revenge upon the man that took the only family Lincoln ever had, now the story itself is 'good' not like mafia good but somehow decent.  Missions: This is where the games gets wrong, missions are repetitive and you will find yourself doing the same stuff over and over again, even killing the bosses is the same, honestly this part is what kills Mafia 3.  Gameplay: Game had several problems at launch and earned most of its bad reviews for having 30 fps look, which today is unnaceptable, after a few patches things got cleared out and the game is working properly now, overall really fluid, cars handling is very good, combat and cover system works and it's fun to play, you also get your friends to help you out providing ammo, weapons, upgrades, etc (for a price)  Soundtrack: Amazing as always, even it was the winner of this year 2016 Golden Joystick Awards for it's amazing soundtrack featuring some of the best songs of the 60 and 70's, gunfire and voice acting is really good, i'll saying extremely good, lipsyncing also is great.  Cutscenes: The best part of the game, this game nails this perfectly by delivering even better dialog and cutscenes that even L.A. Noire, everything is really well made and deserves to be commended by it.  Now you might be thinking 'If i like this game so much, why i'm giving it a bad review', well that's because 2k decided to join other shady companies and start false adversiting the game, claiming that the steam reviews are wrong and Mafia 3 is the fastests best selling games of the last years, even claiming that their games is underdevilered, saying that mafia 3 is one of the best games of all times and everyone that thinks different is wrong, this game have a BIG flaw, it's NOT A MAFIA GAME, missions are repetivie and you find yourself doing the same stuff for the rest of the game, it's fun at first but 60 dollars is a lot of money for something like this, honestly i cannot recommend this game, not now or ever.  Score: 41/100 'decent enough if you wait 1 month and get it for half the price or less, pretty much like battleborn (19.67 dollars 3 months after release at a price that i pay 59.99)'
12430	The graphics literally looks and feels like a xbox 360 game, the driving is awful and lastly the game is 30 fps locked on release??? wtf. I really like the Music, Story-line, Characters, voice acting. I wan't to recommend the game only for those reasons but i can't. I hope they will realise how hard they f***ed over the Pc gamers, and fix their â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game.   If not, i hope i will be able to refund the game and buy it alot cheaper on â¥â¥â¥. Cuz this is not even worth 30 euros ( My opinion ).
12431	Thanks to Steam for REFUND option!

12433	it was a real disspointment, gameplay is bad, there are not many weapons, the story line is just go here kill everyone over and over again. I was exspecting a decent game but it was a real dissapointment.
12434	needs fixing and ill come back to play. Crappy Ai crappy graphics and capped at 30fps is not on.
12435	buggy with missions gone missing, having invisible buildings and boat for the mission, this game has been released as a mess this is a fail as a pc game.  the story i will say is engaging and the graphics from what i saw are par - sub par, The driving in simulation mode made me feel like i was driving in real life and the gun fights were well made that shooting down enemies felt simple.  however i find this gameplay to be way to boring i was not engaged in combat as much and i felt like it was just doing like the same objective with a different person and item.  i can not recommend this game until it is fixed and even then you will have gameplay feel like a chore  story-10/10 Graphics-6/10 gameplay-3.5/10 that is how i rate this game and the poor gameplay for my experience is why i can not reccomend this game
12436	One of the worst games I've played recently. The ambientation is awfull. The history weird, the coold things from the mafia II, lost. The optimization, horrible, the graphics nasty.  Don't â¥â¥â¥â¥ing buy it.
12437	It's just not good.
12438	30FPS on a $3,000 PC. Could have got an Xbox for this BS.
12439	Do NOT buy this game if you were a fan of the previous iterations of Mafia. This game drags the franchise through the mud and spits on it. Gameplay is fun for about 15 hours, even though it's repetitive as hell. At first it all sounds logical, you meet your three underbosses assign their first districts and then it starts to sink through. You open the map and see a bunch of districts and you count in your head and then you say to yourself: even though the gun play feels really good and the driving is fun and easy there is simply too little to do in this world. Shops have literally no use other than giving you some extra money. Lincoln is some kind of super human of unmatched strength, because he one-punch knocks-out every pedestrian he comes across. The AI is a complete joke, calling that an AI is an offense.  I've unlocked three additional districts to the first three you have to unlock to get your underbosses. And tbh: I won't finish this game. The gameplay is too repetitive and the story not entertaining enough for me to endure this nonsense any longer.  Mafia 3 is an unfinished product and I regret buying the season pass beforehand and this game in general. I'm really sad and disappointed, I was awaiting a master piecer after 6 years. But what we get is not what we deserve. Shame on you Hangar13, shame on you 2K.
12440	This game was clearly made for consoles and made into a last minute version for pc. Cannot even play due to frequent dips in the fps.
12441	Unplayable for me  - game CTD for no reason - sound fx dissapeap for no reason - graphical glitches - A.I. stupid as f@#k - story .... Well, he seems to have - AND:  Its a very bad console port.  Devs, Besides that is a port, also you are trying sell third-rate product. Did you even played the Mafia 2? Did you saw its possibilities, features? it is the whole world, it is interesting to dive, but not in your game. Mafia 3 is not AAA. Its simplified clone of previos great games.(GTA not Mafia hehahahahah) u kill sitizens in one hit, u can`t buy cops - they always try to kill you, no one even care that i drive 120ml/h, and make car crash every 5 sec. If u put car on top - u can put it on tires in one button, instead of finding another transport... REALLY? Unlogical item map reveal system(am I in watch dog game? is it sixties or i am from future) Why u put markets and other stuff in game, if the one use of it is to came in - onehit owner and use crowbar to stole money from box. why i always smash windows of car to stole - why no silent unlock? WHY? You now, in 2k16 releasing such sh$t is dispespect to players community.   Steam already reject my refund request cause '7 hours of gameplay' but it was '7 hours of pain and tears' trying to find somethig good in this product.  upd: music is great, cutscenes is great but nothing more for me
12442	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZokdmzvDGA  This video pretty much sums it up.  Good things about this game: Cutscenes  Bad things about this game: Everything else
12443	I was a huge fan of Mafia II and was really looking forward to the sequel. Sadly it's a huge let down.  The only good things about Mafia III are probably the music, cutscenes and the story. But even following the story, you just get bored from doing the super repetitive missions.  For an open world game it's pretty shallow. There's literally nothing to do except the boring missions (kill that guy, destroy this stuff). I wish there was some customization, minigames and so on.  For the technical side: the game runs really bad, it's sadly not supporting SLI either. (Playing on 1440p with 2x 980 TI, settings on medium, no AA, can't hit above 45fps in the city). The graphics and looks of the game are a huge let down aswell. Textures look bad, really bad. And the weird effect (or filter) is really annoying except for in the cutscenes.

12445	Other than the obvious fps problems it looks like someone's smeared vasoline on my screen. It also crashed within 20 min of playing during autosave. Please fix that, seems like a fun game.  + Game has an FOV-slider
12446	  This review is mainly meant for those who have played Mafia II before and want to buy the sequel, Mafia III. Please do keep in mind that I did not come from a blank point of view as I loved Mafia II. Thanks.     TL:DR : Do not waste your money on this game, but buy the prequel Mafia II instead since it features a better storyline, more interaction with the open world and much more eye to detail overall.   Full Review
12447	This game was clearly made for consoles and made into a last minute version for pc. Cannot even play due to frequent dips in the fps.
12448	at the moment it's a meage console port. I had some crashes and the controls are not really good. Poor console port. I'll try the game again when it's fixed... so maybe next year
12449	No.   If you're looking for an empire building game, don't buy Mafia 3. Your wannabe crime syndicate consists of 'partners', which will provide you with some kickback and favors - that's it. No big mansion. No goons. Nothing. Your partners even send you around to do the dirty work for them. Dirty work includes getting trucks, ships, and cars to a racket. Rinse and repeat. Repetition is an enormous flaw of this game. Although the world is pretty big, you'll be visiting the same locations repeatedly. It's just terribly boring.  You don't seem to be able to have a personal car, upgrade your accomodations, change your appearance, etc. Hell, you don't even have a garage.   The cops seem to be blind. You can pass red lights, cause a massive car crash 20 meters infront of them, overtake them with full speed: nothing. Zero â¥â¥â¥â¥s given. But stand next to them for too long, not even looking at them, they'll come crashing down on you.  Stealth/Melee Kills is a joke. You can simply walk around and kill everyone in a single room without getting any heat.   And then there's the collectibles. If you're a completionist like me, you will hate this game so, so much. The collectibles are scattered all over the place - and there are so many. In order to get them, most of the times you'll have to break into buildings, which are totally empty and seem only to exist to make the collectible less accessible. PRO TIP: You can kick down doors. I found out only after half way into the game.   You'll be spending most of your time driving around. Driving is super easy as compared to Mafia 2. I've been driving on simulation mode since the very beginning. What makes driving hard are immovable objects like bushes. Bushes will wreck your car and health bar, it's ridiculous.   Despite all the hate, there are a few good things. Story is great, although I have trouble keeping up with all the different characters. The setting is awesome and it seems that the designers have put alot of effort into building an authentic world. The character animations in the cut scenes are fantastic. The animations are so good, you could actually read their lips and know what they're saying and in what mood. Oh, the soundtrack is great too. But you know what? Just buy the OST, and you'll probably have the best part of the game.   I've been expecting way more from a game with such a considerable price tag. I'll finish the story, but after that it's going straight to the shelf.  Update: Finished the game. Ending was - as the whole game - disappointing. There are three possible endings, which all result from the final choice you get to make. Are you the person who likes to explore all different endings in a game? So am I. But I was so fed up with this game, I didn't even bother making different choices. So, so sad.
12450	Game is, nothing like Mafia 2, they have removed so much detail here is a comparison vid  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixlszwKVVP0#t=230.648987   2 be honest its 10 hrs of repetative gameplay and after ur done there is no fun in playing anymore, u cant style ur car, u cant visit shops etc list goes on, If i didnt know better I would have tought this game was mafia 1, even mafia 1 was better, there is no blood print of shoes when u walk in blood, there is so much crap about this game, when end credit rolled I alt F4 out and uinstalled, not to be played again
12451	The video is not good enough to require the overhead required to play the game. It looks like a game that was coded for a different platform, and shimmed to PC. (my opinion only, might not be true) I am getting tired of purchasing games that are released unfinished, and let the paying public 'Beta Test' it for them. There are 100's of millions of dollars at stake, and they pawn this crap on us. This is a good enough game for PS4 and XBox, but the graphics are not to contemporary standards for the PC. Let this one slide for a couple of months, and then see how much it is at Xmas time, after they have patched the crap out of it, and your video card company has figured out how to make this garbage code work on their product. AND TO ALL YOU JERKS that had a pre-copy from the company and posted those cool vids on Youtube promoting a game that you knew had issues and didn't say anything,....shame on you,...you sold out the people that keep your sorry site alive. Karma is going to f@#k you good for that one laddie. You will never get out of your Mom's basement by acting like that.
12452	Just like the news media cant trust the big game deveopFukers period.  Every one of them is setting this standard to F*ck the gamer/consumer and release a half finished game and in turn laugh all the way to the bank, there is no such thing as to release a decent product any more.  Save your 60 bucks not worth it. This game is so friggin Buggy, glitched out, in that it crashes a lot, it ruins even wanting to play. Pobabably why you could not get 60 FPS from it, now we have 60 FPS but an unplayable game.  They washed out textures at an attempt to make it look like the 60's but in reality another big corperate wh*re game developer cutting corners and releasing a game before its time.   Npc's repeat the same two/three lines, when walking around in town to the point it ruins emersion and becomes robotic like they are not even real people. NPC's that you do engage with in combat, have little to no AI, and the pathing is not broken,not polished.The game does look better when you implement EMB, but again crashing so much it is not worth playing. EMB or Not. 
12453	Pros: Story Cinematics Music Shoot/cover/stealth mechanic is decent  Cons: Very demanding on hardware, but looks dated Lightning varies from good to horrible Pedestrian reactions to crashes are non existent, flip a civilian car over and he just pops out and goes on his merry way Killed someone in the middle of a party, half people runs, half continues dancing. Mafioso 2 meters away stays facing the other way.  If you can look past the dated visuals, have a beast computer, and don't interact with the world too much it's a decent shooter with a decent story and repetetive missions so far (12 hrs in)  I'd give it a 5/10 mehs.  If they patch the performance and/or visuals i'd add a meh or two.
12454	not a very good game not worth 79.99
12455	I use to own this game, but then I refunded and bought Shadow Warrior 2 instead. A wise decision!   I really had high hopes for Mafia III.. but it felt off and just looked far too dated; plus the 30 FPS issue... this had console port written all over it. It's as if the developers and/or 2K didn't care. Which is a complete shame. The silver king is now that I own SW2 I'll have enough leftover to add onto for Dishonored 2!
12456	PC version is pretty buggy and unrefined - beware of sudden crashes (happens a lot), broken interface if using anything bigger than 1920x1080 and FPS not on par of overall graphics quality. Feels like another bad console port.
12457	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZokdmzvDGA  This video pretty much sums it up.  Good things about this game: Cutscenes  Bad things about this game: Everything else
12458	I was a huge fan of Mafia II and was really looking forward to the sequel. Sadly it's a huge let down.  The only good things about Mafia III are probably the music, cutscenes and the story.

12459	At first i gave this game thumb up, but the deeper i got into this game, the more i changed my mind. It's in the end a dumbed down version of Mafia 2. Monotonous.  If you are a straight guy or lesbian woman i guess the plus are the Playboy magazines and Vargas paintings?  Story is good and so is the soundtrack.  That's basically it.  Wait for a SALE before buying.
12460	Three weeks in, still no update for cpus missing SSE4.1/4.2. Sadly I can not refund...  Will play it in half a year or so, when new pc is ready.  Early buyers getting punched in the face again and are 'guinea pigs' for an unfinished game, _again_. And then the game companies complain about the shrinking pc market and pirated games. I don't get it. If this game does not turn out nearly as good as Mafia II, when I am able to play it, I have lost faith in yet another publisher/game devloper.
12461	I'm trying really hard to like this title and thats a problem. Its obviouse a lot of work went into it. I would consider it a work of art but I wasn't shopping for art. I'm an ancient gamer being all old and such. The only thing I could compare this title to is Dragons Lair and old movie based arcade title from the 1980's. Yes I am the Gangster Dirk Daring pushing a few buttons in between long tedious cut scenes. They would have been better off making a movie, the story line is very engaging. I'm watching it every week on Cinemax with the series Quary. This title fails to peak the interest of my inner gangster. You see I want to be the gangster not watch someone else do it.
12462	I kept my cool whilst the 60fps-racket was going, I mean they patched it after a short while. The story in itself is alright, but as I progressed through the game I found it increasingly difficult to oversee the obvious shortcomings of this game. My biggest irk, is the length required to complete it. I used 30 hours, and A LOT of this was pure repetition. I feel like Obi Wan yelling angrily to Anakin at the end of ep3, where he was supposed to bring balance! â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥it, I had such high hopes for this after the fallacy of Mafia II. But alas, my hope crumbled. For shame!
12463	If I wanted to play assassins creed syndicate again I would just replay assassins creed syndicate not pay â¥â¥â¥â¥in 500kr for a glitchier, straighter version
12464	My first review on steam I think.  Im a huge fan of the first Mafia game. It is one of those few games I played from the beginning to the end many times. The second Mafia game had a very nice story, but gameplay wise already felt it was missing something the first one did perfect. Still a very enjoyable game though. And then, we got the third version. I tried my best not to watch any trailers or gameplay videos and thankfully succeded in this. Therefore the hype only got to me in the week of release. I have all the gameplatforms at home, so doubted for a long time for which platform I wanted to buy the game. At the one hand, console is easy plug and play, but on the other hand the PC ususally has more graphical options. Then there was the issue of Mafia 2 having problems on the PC. But I decided to take the risk.  First: The PC version is really not good. I have a moderate PC (it was really high end a year or two ago), with two R9 290X cards and a decent i7 processor. This PC runs most games at high or ultra settings on 60 fps, but has problems running Mafia 3 at 30 fps at normal settings. And then it still does not really look nice. There is something with the graphics that makes the game look really....off.... somehow. Next to the peformance issues, I came across quite some bugs with cars driving with open doors, cars sinking through the ground, and other strange things.  The gameplay of mafia 3 is really average. The gunplay is nice, with every weapon feeling a bit different and a nice selection of weapons to pick from. I went with the silent approach in the missions, and the silenced weapons really helped with that. Other than the gunplay, there is really not much to it. Sneaking is quite easy, with really easy enemies, you can pull towards you one by one with a wistle. And if you do happen to screw up, you just shoot your way through the end of the mission with no real penalty.  The driving is decent, but with lack of traffic rules you had in the first two games, there is no real challenge. Where I started the game driving nice with the rest of the traffice, I soon turned to high speed racing throught the city with no concequences. The cool thing about the previous mafia games was that you could get pulled over for speeding or hitting other traffic.   Then the story. This is the one thing where I liked the previous maffia games the best. The story of those games were wonderfull, and I have really good memories to them till this day. I have to say that I like the old italian mafia setting of those games a lot. The setting of mafia 3 did not really apeal to me, except for the music in that era. But, when i started Mafia 3, I really like the way they told the story. It had a really nice movie kind of story telling, with good looking cut scenes and a well thought off plot development. however, halfway of the game this story started to go to the background and the repetative mission structure got the upperhand. They got back to the story to the end of the game, but it never really got to me anymore. Then there is the srange way of putting choises in the story. You conquer districts of the city and have to give these to one of your three luitanents. I tried to keep everyone happy till the end, which I was able to do. So there was not really a lot of options in that area. Then, at the end of the story, they suddenly put in three or so choices which decide the outcome of this story. Somehow, this feels kinda rushed. They developed the main character quite well, you know why he does what he is doing, end then suddenly you have to make the choice of who he is and what he is gonna do. Feels strange.   All in all im dissapointed with this game. The mafia franchise is really dear to me. And this game is just not living up to the series. I enjoyed it, but it is really not a top notch game.   ps: sorry for my English, not my first language.
12465	The game runs like â¥â¥â¥â¥. The beginning was really promising with awesome cutscenes and story. That's when I decided not to refund even at a 30FPS lock cause the game ran well indoors.  After the prologue the game turns into a repetitive mess with barely any cinematics at all. My i5-6600K @4.6GHz and my GTX 1080 OC'ed can't even run this game at a decent framerate. Indoors it's usually ~30-60 with constant dips to the point of nausea. Outside driving or running around it usually stays at ~30-40 with any combination of settings with the same random framerate dips. It has weird stutters and the game looks nowhere near what the screenshots show even with a pretty well mandatory reshade I'm using.  This game should be set as early access and I'm finding it hard to even keep playing to get my money out of it with how badly it runs and looks. Save yourself some money, buy Mafia 2 and enjoy that instead.
12466	Do not buy this game. graphics are pretty bad, washy looking. sound track is the only thing going for this game, the whole game is about doing the same repetitive stuff, gets boring quick.
12467	I must admit. I was really looking forward to this game. I even preordered it. And when I came out, I didn't even had time to play it the first few days.  And when I finally had the time to play it. Oh boy, was I disappointed.  First of, the game is barely playable at this stage. It crashed every 30 min. or so, and at times, the game can't even start back up, until you do some idiotic unneeded tweaking.  But when that's said. The story is amazing, the graphics is alright, but not top class AAA-title awardable. The atmosphere is exeptionally good. The scenery fits the time period, and driving through the beautiful 60's Bayou is soothing, especially while listening to some old time 60's rock classics.  But even though the game looks and sounds amazing, there's a few flaws which makes me dislike the game more, than I like it. The crashing is one of them. Second is the 30 FPS lock. I got a quite high end computer, and I even got problems running this game full optimized. Got a few lag spikes, graphic glitches and so on.  The lighting in this game is very poorly done. If the sun shines in a specific way on a specific object, all objects around become all white, and the reflections looks like a plastic back with water in it. It's really bad.  I have to lower my ambient oclussion just to make the lighting and reflection look just alittle like normal, but it doesn't help much. Only a tiny bit.  Also the third installment of Mafia (which has absolutely nothing to do which Mafia), is missing some huge key components, which made Mafia 1 and 2 great and much different from other open world games. The fuel-system, has been removed, which was an at times irritating part of the game, but still made the Mafia games different from others.  The cop-system has also been removed. In the first two Mafia games, you would get police tailing you, if you ran a red light, or drove too fast. In Mafia 3, they do not even bother to look at you, when you drive past them at 200mph, while running a red light. I guess that was normal in the 60's.......  And lastly... Knowing this is a 3rd-gen game, you would think that vehicle would deshape, when driving into things... Nope. Cars are hard as rocks apparently. Glass shatter, and the cars burst in flames, when damaged enough. But that's it.  There's absolutely no deformation of the cars, not even a little bump in the car doors. It's ridicously lazy of the developers.  Mafia 3 has been in development for so long, and they come out with a game, that worse than it's 12 year old predecessor.. Really... Hangar 13, you have let this fan, and many others down!  Shame on you. Shame on you for taking your fans money, and giving us this ball of bullcrap. :( I'm dissapointed in you.   TL:DR Pros: Good graphics, amazing soundtrack and music, beautiful scenery, great story. Cons: Crashes, graphical glitches, repetitive missions, and a nerve wrecking 30 FPS lock (even on high-end computers), lots of missing elements (which made the Mafia-games different).
12468	This game has its moments, I dont recomend dowloading it on the pc. i consider the graphics to be terrible for a pc game. very low frame rates with everything on medium running 2 970 in sli. aroud 36fps. story is very repetative. the animations when running, shooting are bad. the voice acting is good. its like a super cheap gta 5 with bad frame rates. ive used inspector, tried every code, tried forcing alternate frame rendering 2. nothing, tried setting v sync to adaptive, nothing. tried using 1 graphics card and stilll bad frame rates. in sli i get about 88 pecent per gpu.
12469	this â¥â¥â¥â¥ is all around buttass.
12470	Good charachters and a good sound track do not make up for what is essentialy a game made up of repeating side missions.  It starts off so well but as soon as you are past the initial mission and the resulting betrayal (the basis of the story) its boring. the same missions over, and over and over again. Drive here kill this guy/interogate this guy/steal this map/destroy this crate. That is literaly the variation in 'story chapters' It's a shame really as this game has so much potential. its just let down by lazy repetitive game play.   This game needs more in the way of story missions!  Forgot to mention the dodgy Key Binding options. and which idiot decided it would be a good idea to have the choice between Lethal and Non Lethal take downs be an option in the game settings? It simply doesn't make sense!
12471	Do not buy this game. graphics are pretty bad, washy looking. sound track is the only thing going for this game, the whole game is about doing the same repetitive stuff, gets boring quick.
12472	How to correct a name of this game in 5 steps:  1) Chose a correct name. There is some possibilities:  - Not a Mafia 3  - Bug Life 3  - Meh 3 2) Right click on shorcut of 'Mafia 3' at the desktop and rename it. 3) Copy/write one of the correct names from step 1. 4) Press enter to apply 5) Done.
12473	No... Just no... Got a refund for this crap. Releasing a game with such obvious issues that should have been picked up during quality testing is not ok in 2016. There is no excuse when we are paying almost 4 times the amount of money than compared to a blu ray movie... There is no excuse for releasing unfinished games. And accepting that its ok is going to produce more games with issues in the future. So im taking a hard stance now. To all you developers thinking your product is finished?? Check it again... Cause if you release it and its got a dumb issue that should have been picked up I will refund that crap before you can say 'My game companies going broke'.  I will not be ripped off any longer...
12474	Doesn't perform very well on PC. Disappointing, repetitive, follows the exact same mission template from start to finish. The first 5 hours were really fun, then it all just went down the drain. Interrogate informators, kill minor goons, damage comodities, kill racket boss, repeat, kill district boss, repeat X times until you reach the end (oh, and you don't even get to kill the guy yourself, you get a cutscene middlefinger). ClichÃ© story, zero interesting twists, practically non-existent character development, no car/character customization, graphics are also pretty bad on ultra+poorly optimalized.
12475	I must admit. I was really looking forward to this game. I even preordered it. And when I came out, I didn't even had time to play it the first few days.  And when I finally had the time to play it. Oh boy, was I disappointed.  First of, the game is barely playable at this stage. It crashed every 30 min. or so, and at times, the game can't even start back up, until you do some idiotic unneeded tweaking.  But when that's said. The story is amazing, the graphics is alright, but not top class AAA-title awardable. The atmosphere is exeptionally good. The scenery fits the time period, and driving through the beautiful 60's Bayou is soothing, especially while listening to some old time 60's rock classics.  But even though the game looks and sounds amazing, there's a few flaws which makes me dislike the game more, than I like it. The crashing is one of them. Second is the 30 FPS lock. I got a quite high end computer, and I even got problems running this game full optimized. Got a few lag spikes, graphic glitches and so on.  The lighting in this game is very poorly done. If the sun shines in a specific way on a specific object, all objects around become all white, and the reflections looks like a plastic back with water in it. It's really bad.  I have to lower my ambient oclussion just to make the lighting and reflection look just alittle like normal, but it doesn't help much. Only a tiny bit.  Also the third installment of Mafia (which has absolutely nothing to do which Mafia), is missing some huge key components, which made Mafia 1 and 2 great and much different from other open world games. The fuel-system, has been removed, which was an at times irritating part of the game, but still made the Mafia games different from others.  The cop-system has also been removed. In the first two Mafia games, you would get police tailing you, if you ran a red light, or drove too fast. In Mafia 3, they do not even bother to look at you, when you drive past them at 200mph, while running a red light. I guess that was normal in the 60's.......  And lastly... Knowing this is a 3rd-gen game, you would think that vehicle would deshape, when driving into things... Nope. Cars are hard as rocks apparently. Glass shatter, and the cars burst in flames, when damaged enough. But that's it.  There's absolutely no deformation of the cars, not even a little bump in the car doors. It's ridicously lazy of the developers.  Mafia 3 has been in development for so long, and they come out with a game, that worse than it's 12 year old predecessor.. Really... Hangar 13, you have let this fan, and many others down!  Shame on you. Shame on you for taking your fans money, and giving us this ball of bullcrap. :( I'm dissapointed in you.   TL:DR Pros: Good graphics, amazing soundtrack and music, beautiful scenery, great story. Cons: Crashes, graphical glitches, repetitive missions, and a nerve wrecking 30 FPS lock (even on high-end computers), lots of missing elements (which made the Mafia-games different).
12476	I played the first hour of the game so far. The game already hard crash to desktop while loading after a cut-scene. Not a great way to start the game. I still look forward to play the game and its story. But if you are on the fence, you might be better of waiting until they patch the game a few more times. Then again if you donât mind a bug or two, and the unpredictable crash. Go ahead and but it. Just know what you are paying for.
12477	sadly the game dident start,, not on my windows 7 or 10 tryde to start on two diferent computers and still never got to the main menu.... got my money back tho,,,, still want to play the game but when it dont work it dont work no mather how helpfull the steam suport try to help, im still crying :'(
12478	Played 10 hours of the game....Everything was all sorta fun done a couple of missions a couple of side missions. Next thing i know the save data wants to couropt on me and doesnt give me the option to keep the save file it automatically deletes it all my 10 hours of off and on playing it are gone. Im still going to restart and grind threw it and hopefully get there in a day or two but this is rediculous.
12479	It's a great mess. Thats the best way to describe Mafia III. It has an amazing story but bland and repetitive gameplay and an unfinshed feel. The steam controller support for this game is horrendous, and the button prompts don't even show up in game. And I have had many annoying glitches and bugs. I also got quite bored about half way through the story, and overall lost my drive to complete it. Overall, It is a very good story ruined by unimaginative gameplay and terrible optimization  It is a borderline thumbs down.
12480	This game has its moments, I dont recomend dowloading it on the pc. i consider the graphics to be terrible for a pc game. very low frame rates with everything on medium running 2 970 in sli. aroud 36fps. story is very repetative. the animations when running, shooting are bad. the voice acting is good. its like a super cheap gta 5 with bad frame rates. ive used inspector, tried every code, tried forcing alternate frame rendering 2. nothing, tried setting v sync to adaptive, nothing. tried using 1 graphics card and stilll bad frame rates. in sli i get about 88 pecent per gpu.
12481	Good charachters and a good sound track do not make up for what is essentialy a game made up of repeating side missions.  It starts off so well but as soon as you are past the initial mission and the resulting betrayal (the basis of the story) its boring. the same missions over, and over and over again. Drive here kill this guy/interogate this guy/steal this map/destroy this crate. That is literaly the variation in 'story chapters' It's a shame really as this game has so much potential. its just let down by lazy repetitive game play.   This game needs more in the way of story missions!  Forgot to mention the dodgy Key Binding options. and which idiot decided it would be a good idea to have the choice between Lethal and Non Lethal take downs be an option in the game settings? It simply doesn't make sense!
12482	This game is a buggy unfinished product.  Right from the get go it was clitchy and prone to freezing periodically. Even though my system meets the recomended specs. Honestly it just feels like a half hearted console port.  Pretty much guarentees that I won't ever preorder another 2k game.
12483	Its a good story, may be worth the time too kill some time. But its programed like â¥â¥â¥â¥, a LOT of bugs in the game. I hade something like 10 'chrash too desktop' (wasent yesturday i hade that porblem in a game). And a lot of alternativs in the game that wasent posible to see so you hade too know what to do. So i would say it aint worth the money until they fix it up, it aint finished
12484	there is nothing to do in freeroam, its really empty as f*ck :(
12485	this â¥â¥â¥â¥ is all around buttass.
12486	What initially drew me in with the Mafia series was the story. Instead of GTA's cartoonish satire, the original 2002 Mafia had a gripping plot with unseen of levels of characterization for an open-world game. Mafia 2 took eight years to get released and was, perhaps predictably, a letdown. Mafia 3, unfortunately, does not buck the trend.  While the Louisiana-flavored setting of the game is great and the gameplay mechanics are solid, the story and mission design leave a lot to be desired. The first few hours set the scene beautifully and it felt like the ride ahead was going to be great, but Mafia 3 very quickly became a serious grind. The main missions started to resemble throwaway side missions of better games - cut&amp;paste jobs that had exactly the same goals every single time and played exactly the same every time.  I needed to take a lot of breaks while playing because the repetition numbs you very quickly. I stubbornly plowed through the checkpoints in pursuit of the small story nuggets, hoping they'd eventually amount to something bigger, but the only thing that grew was my frustration, blossoming into full-blown boredom towards the end.  It's a real shame, because technically, there's not much to harp about: The game looks very nice. The sound design is great. The soundtrack is great too (although a bit limited). The systems work. But tying the story to the gameplay fails almost completely. Or maybe it's just the wrong kind of story for this kind of game. It feels hollow; soulless. It's a row of checkboxes on a form. A spreadsheet. A story that could only hope to work in a computer game medium, and even there, it doesn't.  Will I recommend the game even though I finished it? No, not really. It's not that the game is bad, it's just painfully mediocre. If you badly need a diversion, Mafia 3 is far from the worst choice you could make. But it's equally far from the best possible choice.
12487	I am not quite sure whether I like or dislike this game. First of all, mafia 3 is neither mafia 1 nor mafia 2, it's more like a gta 5 in a different time, with less features, more ubisoft collect-a-likes and much more stereotypes.   I miss the great story from mafia 1 and the great characters from mafia 2. At least the gameplay and gunplay is really good, but this is definitely not enough!   Usually I would say this game is just medicore at it's best. If you loved the old mafias you will lose your motivation to play on quite fast. Very disapointing I really enjoyed the begin of the game, but the absence of story bothered me to much.   P.S. On top of that, this game is a big party of bugs :D
12488	If I knew how bad MAFIA II -&gt; MAFIA III will be, I didn't even play this game at out of HUMBLE BUNDLE !!! -_- GTX 1070 and this Game still looks like 2005.
12489	In it's current form, I wouldn't recommend Mafia 3. It has the potential but a lot of bugs, especially with the cop spawning and spotting. Light and visual glitches don't effect the gameplay, just annoying but hopefully they can fix it. The Aiming system could use some work as well as the damage to enemies since you have to either headshot them or shoot them 10 times to kill them which is annoying since they'll still shoot you with high accuracy while being shot. Story line is amazing though which is why it can be a great game if they fix the bugs/glitches in it. Hopefully they do this before they release DLC.
12490	Last time I was about to write such a bad review was for No Man's Sky.   I won't say much about gameplay cause I didn't play much of the game since the bugs, glitches, artefacts, stutterings and overall poor performances ruined it. This port is a shame and the developpers don't show much interest in improving it or that's just bad communication. I don't know and I don't care anymore.  
12491	I've only played a few hours and i'm already bored to death of how repetiting this game is
12492	Well, the graphics are really nice/cool. :P
12493	  Although the story to this game is pretty great so far, I can't recommend it until the devs fix the awful performance and bugs
12494	I do like the story line but in all honestly I hate the gameplay.  Damage on cars it seems is non exsistant until the car blows up in your face. e.g. Your going 105 mph and you crash into someone, you lose a tad of heatlh. Rev into a lampost from a standstill, the car ignites into flames. Charecter movement is very wooden and glitchy, when I tell the charecter to take cover, it glicthes between taking cover and running into an object. AI is predictable and largely seems to be on rails. The gameplay is very repetitive and always seems to be the same, Mission structure is basically go to X, kill Z, steal Y. This game doesnt even compare to its predocessor Mafia 2. Really want to enjoy this game, Im forcing myself to play it to the end. Verdict: Disapointing gameplay, really expected more from 2k and Rockstar. In my opinion they could have done alot better. Really enjoying the storyline but i dont know if thats enough merit buying the game.
12495	As most of us, I bought mafia III with visions of shooting gangsters in my head. While the shooting gangsters part was true there where many things left out or unpolished in the experience.  Let's break this down one section at a time.  TL;DR at the end  Missions: Easilly the games weakest point. Now we all expect a game like this to have lots of shooting, that's not the issue. The problem is after playing through one or two rackets the originality of missions is practically gone. The missions break down as follows: Get information from this guy, Steal X, Kill these guys, destroy X, kill/capture this guy. Infact after playing through the entire game I can only remember one mission being somewhat different. There is a stealth option to let you mix things up, more on that later. However I will say that most of the missions never feel like you are diverting from lincols goal. Every missions having a place a long the way to kill Sal.  Side missions: Some of the side missions are where things get more interesting, such as hunting down vito's hitlist. However these missions are just about as bland. The only saving grace being the conversations with the underbosses. These make the characters come to life more and give you a feeling of being closer to them. One of the very few occurances for the underbosses in the game.  Other things to do: There isn't much beyond collectables. You also can't use your money for anything but weapons, supplies and upgrades. So you not only never change your cloths throughout the game but you don't do anything else. No getting yourself a new suit, upgrading your car (all car upgrades are passive to cars in your garage), new paintjob, getting a bite to eat to regen your health. Infact you don't even use your money to bribe anyone. This destroys the whole mafia illusion simply changing the story to a revenge plot with the mafia bit being a side line.  Gameplay: One of the most satisfying things to do in Mafia III is shoot people. Unlike most games they will react to bullets hitting them, their bodies moving from the impact and shear pain of a bullet going through them. Most enemies don't feel like bullet sponges. Now onto the stealth. The game offers a stealth option. I will say that stealth can be good fun but it is still unpolished. For example if one enemy sees you there is a good chance even a bullet in what you think is in time would stop everyone from being alerted. The AI is also rather dumb with stealth. During the game one of your goals is to make enough money to afford taking out Sal. However the only thing you can ever spend this money on is upgrades to lincoln, guns/gun upgrades, car upgrades. The enemies in the game also never get harder which makes most of the guns pointless. You could pick out the two weapons you like using the most and get through the game. I used the silenced m1n1 and the blackburn pistol through the majority of the game with no problems.   The weapon veriaty itself is also lacking. Many weapons only being slightly worse then the next or whole guns being rendered pointless by them being so close there is no point. Infact one of the supposed 'best' pistols the clipper.44 is a reward from burke. This gun is actually worse then one I can buy earlier one and for cheaper (unless the clipper was given to you). Shotguns are also dissapointing. Enemies will get knocked back by them but not only do they fire slowly they also have a much shorter effective range then actual shotguns. Unless you are up close and personal they won't help you.   Story/characters: The game shines it's brightest with it's story and expertly voice acted cut scenes. Through these cutscenes the characters and game come to life in a way gameplay doesn't. Not just story wise but also graphically, which is a bit of a shame, would love to have seen the whole game look as good as the cutscenes. The way the game tells it's story through a documentary style fashion is a nice touch.  The characters themselves are good, except for some cliches such as clay's quest for vengance changing him into more of a two dimensional protagonist.  Setting: It's obvious the devs spent alot of time recreating a 1960's new orleans type feel. Every part of the game feels authentic to the time period, even down to the uncensored racial slurs. This I have to commend them for, making a game with this kind of commitment in a world where people seem to always find something to complain about.  Glitches: In one word, ragdoll. Enemies will sometimes get stuck in a sitting position after death, with nothing holding them up. My favorite is when I pull a freshly knifed enemy to the side to chuck him and he decided being a part of the door/wall is more his style.  I will also mention there was one instance of an enemy in a car seemingly being bullet proof. Turns out when an enemy leans out the window to shoot you his hit boxes stay the same as if he was sitting in the car. Remember, aim for his â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, apparently.  In conclusion the game had a very strong start but by the end I was left feeling unaccomplished. If I was able to return the game now, I would. While I still think it's a good game it doesn't deserve 60 dollars. Maybe 20-30 at most.  TL;DR  Good- Solid shooting, great story, fantastic setting  neutral- graphics are a bit sub-par but still looks great, about 20 hours long.  Bad- Some unfortunate glitches, bland repetative missions, weapon veriaty, money only spent on guns/upgrades
12496	 Did Hangar 13 overreach themselves?
12497	Very disapointing to Mafia 2. This game dosn't make you feel like you are part of a Mafia. It just makes you feel like a killer trying to get revenge. Not only is the story guite boring so is the gameplay. â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ frame rate and the game crashes a lot.  Don't buy
12498	It's a great mess. Thats the best way to describe Mafia III. It has an amazing story but bland and repetitive gameplay and an unfinshed feel.

12503	Well, the graphics are really nice/cool. :P
12504	Honestly a great story let down by repeative boring missions.
12505	This Game is just â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥   nuff said  would refund if my son hadn't played it for 3 hours  running a GTX 1080 and it's still awful
12506	Not even close to first game. Even mafia 2 is better than this crap.  Pros:  Soundtrack  Cons:  Everything   2k should give this game to cd projekt, than maybe we can play a nice game.
12507	I was and still am huge fan of Mafia series, started with Mafia and for ages waited Mafia II. And when it was released it was something epic. Unfortunately this time its not the case. The only thing this game keeps to other series is great story. But this time story is just video insert during game, while missions are repetitive and boring 'grab' or 'kill' and even though it has massive map, all of this repeats in each district. Actually if you played DLC jimmy's vendetta on Mafia II- it compares to it very well. But Jimmy's vendetta was only DLC and now it is a game. I know Mafia II had complains about not beeing open world enough, but this time it feels like it was done sacrificing game itself.  Even graphics and physics are not realistic anymore (which for me made Mafia II incredible). This time there are no small nicks and knacks that makes game stand out from other series. For me Mafia was always trumping GTA series. Not this time. It feels like copy of GTA actually. Especially when they show some gang arriving in three cars. the physics. the looks. the moves. everything is different and seems unnatural compared to Mafia II.   So all in all I would say that if you played and enjoyed Mafia series in past- I don't recommend buying it for that. You will be disappointed. BUT if old Mafia series seemed too slow paced for you or you loved GTA series and you prefer action over details - you probably will like this game.
12508	Honestly a great story let down by repeative boring missions.
12509	Gameplay is cut &amp; paste from every generic open-world game that has come out in the last five years. Swap out the gameplay with Mad Max, The Division, or any other mediocre disappointment that's been billed out to useless developers.  Story is decent, but nothing worth your time, and the gameplay isn't related to the events in the cutscenes most of the time. Complete enough fluff to meet the fluff-threshold and then you get a cutscene about how you killed the guy you're about to kill, spoiling it literally minutes before you go to a place where you've just been, to fight guards that have just respawned, to kill the guy like in the cutscene.  Recommendation: Watch the cutscenes on Youtube, you're not missing anything in the gameplay.  Better Recommendation: Save yourself the time of watching all of that. Play the first hour of the game and then return it. When the main charcter goes 'I'm going to kill the bad guy' you've reached the end of the story. It doesn't get any more, or less, complex. Main character decides to kill the bad guy. Main character kills the bad guy. Game over. No twists, no obstacles of note, no betrayal. Everything goes exactly as planned and the bad guy gets killed. The end.  P.S.: I really liked the part where it crashed during the last cutscene. Really built the suspense, having to go through the last mission again, sit through the credits again, and then sit through the credits for a third time before it let me quit.  Score: 9/11
12510	I regret my purchase. Only 5 hours or so in, I didn't find much fun in this, because of the repetitive missions. I couldn't find myself to care much for the characters, because they kept going on-and-on about how Lincoln (the main character) is so bad â¥â¥â¥... and I just roll my eyes when every scene keeps repeating this. The PC controls could use some tweaking, because it always feel like their is a half second delay before performing the action I want.
12511	Im not quite sure if i should give this a positive review or not, i feel like im slighty going towards the negative side.  My game does run smoothly ( apart from the 30 fps ) - and i've played for a reasonable amount of time in these 2 days.   I feel like the game is very dull - clear the rackets - kill the underbosses - kill the boss - repeat. Apart from the little side quest here and there, its very linear. The driving is nothing special, the game is also very easy ( even on the hardest difficulty ) However, the story telling is very well done, as are the cinematics, its one of the few reasons i still play. I did just rage quit because i jumped down a 1 story building thinking i'd survive, i mean, even in real life you wouldnt even sprain anything... but in this game, i died while on full health..so dont jump off anything at all...  So far i had a better time playing The Godfather series....  + Story  + Cinematics  +/- Shooting - Driving - AI  - Grinding ( why do they always have to include so many collectables in every game? Isnt the game long enough? ) - Dying while jumping off a 4 meter tall building  I had high hopes for this game, so far its a let down. I recommend waiting untill its on sale. 
12512	I have loved the mafia games since playing the first one as a kid. So I really want to like this game, despite the porty feel to it, the bad optimization in cities, the awful cqc system compared to mafia 2 and the fps cap that will likely be fixed.   The game looks promising so far , but im stuck on the first mission. I changed my controls so F is my cqc button (standard). This meant that i shuffled q to be my cover button and ctrl to be sneak. Long story short this broke the game.   Now not only can't I kill people with cqc, but the button to close the tips pop up doesn't work so I can't progress. I tried changing it back but it didnt fix it. So yea im stuck unable to progress until they can fix this poor excuse of a port. :/  ***EDIT***  They fixed the keyboard mapping glitch that stopped me from progressing but now I have gotten to the rest of the game, and I understand why they left the 30fps cap. My fps hovers around 20-30 fps on unlimited. Even on high the game still looks like crap. I don't know how this is possible. Why is this game such a downgrade from Mafia 2?   The people in charge of characters and story good job. Everything else is poo. Stealth is stupid easy because the ai is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. The missions are really copy paste so far and hard to enjoy when even on the hardest difficulty just dicking around I havent died once in 6 hrs.  Sad day. Wait for a lot of patches.  ***EDIT 2***  I tried to get a refund for the game because I don't see it as playable at this time. Steam denied me because I played 5 hrs 44 min, which is over their 2 hr limit. Most of that time I spent trying to fix this broken game. I have never asked for a refund before but forcing me to pay for a game that doesnt work, that I should have been able to enjoy, is not bright.
12513	 tl;dr Don't buy it at this time.   This is a game I've been waiting for, for a very long time. Ever since Mafia 2 was released, I've been waiting for the next one. Mafia 1 was my favourite game when I was younger. It's what really got me into gaming. After the, in my opinion, somewhat anti-climatic ending of Mafia 2, I was really looking forward to see if 2K could add another great game to the series.  Now it's here. And it's... it's not a Mafia game. It just doesn't feel like Mafia. It feels like the developers have played a little too much GTA, and decided to make a copy of it. I've played a lot of the previous Mafia games, as I'm sure plenty of you have as well. I've completed the first Mafia game 5 times, Mafia 2 once on normal, and then thrice on hard. With Mafia 3, I doubt I'll play it more than once. At the time of writing this, I've played roughly 9 hours. It's been out for 24 hours exactly, and I feel 'meh' about playing more. When Mafia 2 was released, I had completed it two days later. It was just that good. I'll probably finish Mafia 3 this comming weekend, I have enough trust in my inner geek. I just don't really want to play it...  Below is a short list of reason to buy it, as well as a list of reasons not to.   Reason to buy the game:    -The story, so far, is good. It's not on the same levels as the previous Mafia games, but it's solid.    -The music. Just like Mafia 2, the developers have implemented the actual music from this time period, making the game feel more immersive.    -The gun combat. My god. I've played plenty of shooting games. But this games shooting just feels so damn satisfying. Unloading a clip into en enemy, seeing him fall back, or maybe over a railing, while your gun is smoking... it's just so good.    Reasons not to buy the game:   (Note: many of these things are technical, and can be resolved with patches.) -The graphics. This is, disappointingly, quite clearly a console port. The graphics just aren't good. For a PC game in this day and age, the graphics are simply not good enough.    -The driving. What happened here? Compared to Mafia 2, the driving in this game is just strange. It seems Lincoln only know two modes; brake or foot to the floor. You go form sitting at a red light, to trying to take off like a drag racer. Theres also no speed limiter. At first I thought this would be really annoying, seeing how cops enforce the speed limit in this game, just like the previous ones. But I've yet to have any cops chase me for going too quick. To test this i drove past a police car going 100 mph, and they didn't even bother chasing me.    -The AI. While there is games that do this worse, the AI could use some work.    -And ofcourse, what every other review is also stating. The FPS lock... It's not acceptable, and is, for me, reason enough not to buy the game.   While the above are there to help you make a decision about buying the game, there are a few things I would have thought would be nice to know before I bought it.   -Cut scenes, with ingame models, sometimes have strange animations and lighting.-The map is not as big as you might think. Driving from one end to the other takes very little time. It  feels  around the same size as Mafia 2.-It feels more like a GTA game, than it does a Mafia game.  The game is over all pretty okay. It's nothing like the previous games. I think the developers took a little too much inspiration from GTA 5, and forgot they were making a Mafia game.   I, personally, disagree with the time period they chose. Or atleast the way they did it. If we weren't an outsider, taking down the Mafia, maybe it would've worked better. In my opinion, there would have been better periods to depict in a Mafia game.  I've never written a review before, but I hope this helped you make the decision. Whether you end up buying the game or not, I hope I was of some help.
12514	I'm not entirely sure how they're able to get away with selling this game alongside gameplay videos and screenshots that are in no way representative of the end product. It's not just the 30 FPS, the graphics are extremely MUDDY and low resolution. Turning certain graphical features OFF actually makes the graphics improve, which makes me wonder if this is the developers first time working with a PC after a career developing slot machines for the app store. Gameplay so far is a mixed bag too, in trying to make a true open world game this time around, the missions and objectives have less flavour to them. The AI is very clunky and stilted and moves predictably meaning you're rarely in any real danger. I have enjoyed the driving physics so far, the muscle cars in particular drift in a satisfying way, and the in-car combat system works well. I'm hoping further patches will help improve this - not just FPS, but fixing the AA and increasing the texture resolution so that it matches the screen resolution.
12515	Mafia 3 tells the story of Lincoln Clay, an ex-military war veteran who returns home to find his city mixed up in a mess involving major crime organisations.   The game begins with mixed missions but as you go on you realise you are doing the same things repeatedly. When I began the game, I planned to compete the 'story missions' and the 'optional chapters', however, as I continued to play I realised that If i continued this I would be too bored to finished the game so I stuck to story missions.   The graphics in this game are exceptional and impress, the game optimisation on the other hand is another story. Despite having a high-end computer mafia 3 struggles to reach the 50fps mark. At times, it will between 60 and 100 but this is a rear occurrence. However, if you don't mind the low frames the game is very pleasing to look at.   The story involves killing many underbosses before reaching the main boss. It involves taking over districts and then assigning them to your chosen partners. It is safe to say this game is the most repetitive game I've ever played. The only mission type is killing. You are tasked with interrogating, killing, killing to get money and killing to get either drugs or other items.   The game currently lacks basic features which I think should have been incorporated into the game in the beginning. Firstly, there should be much better character optimisation. A choice of about 10 outfits is a poor effort. Secondly, the creators did not incorporate very much vehicle modifications besides the basics (speed upgrade, bulletproof tyres). You are not given a set vehicle; you can call Vito and get a choice of 9 cars every time you need one (for free). As for the money, you collect, it's pointless. Most of the guns once unlocked can be equipped for free making money pointless besides for buying grenades, Molotovâs or for character or vehicle upgrades. The 'adrenaline' is also pointless because most missions have more than one first aid cabinets.   One of the major plusses about this game is the fact that the character development is very good. I felt very engaged with Lincoln Clay's character. Some of the cut scenes are good but some of them are repetitive.  The game would be worth between Â£10 and Â£15 depending on how determined you are to complete the game. Iâve reached 23 hours (at the time of this review) and have killed every underboss. But I donât have the drive to continue.  
12516	Im not quite sure if i should give this a positive review or not, i feel like im slighty going towards the negative side.  My game does run smoothly ( apart from the 30 fps ) - and i've played for a reasonable amount of time in these 2 days.   I feel like the game is very dull - clear the rackets - kill the underbosses - kill the boss - repeat. Apart from the little side quest here and there, its very linear. The driving is nothing special, the game is also very easy ( even on the hardest difficulty ) However, the story telling is very well done, as are the cinematics, its one of the few reasons i still play. I did just rage quit because i jumped down a 1 story building thinking i'd survive, i mean, even in real life you wouldnt even sprain anything... but in this game, i died while on full health..so dont jump off anything at all...  So far i had a better time playing The Godfather series....  + Story  + Cinematics  +/- Shooting - Driving - AI  - Grinding ( why do they always have to include so many collectables in every game? Isnt the game long enough? ) - Dying while jumping off a 4 meter tall building  I had high hopes for this game, so far its a let down. I recommend waiting untill its on sale. 
12517	I don't usually do reviews, and I'd honestly like to play more of this game before I make one, but I legit can't. So far, after 25 minutes of playing, my game has crashed 4 times, yes, 4 times. Not sure how I'm supposed to review a game that can't even last through 6 and a half minutes of play time. Do not buy this game, at least not right now. This is just a terribly done PC port. It doesn't run properly, crashes constantly, and it has a 30fps lock. Wait until 2k actually patches the game and makes it playable before you even consider buying.  UPDATE After 5 hours in, game still crashes, I have had over 20 crashes at this point, haven't even made it 15% into the story mode. Steam won't refiund me. Glad I payed 60 dollars for a crashing simulator.
12518	Can't even get past the 'Main Menu' Screen. After lowering all the setting to their lowest point, and clicking 'Play Now' it goes to a black screen and immediately crashes, This is even after 3 Re-Installs... Paid the full price like everyone else.  As of right now, No.. I do not recommened anybody else paying $60.00 for a non working game.
12519	Most repetitive and overhyped game ever.
12520	 Did Hangar 13 overreach themselves?
12521	Not much of the classic Mafia vibe left, and the new direction doesn't speak to me although I can feel the message about racism they wanted to deliver. For what it's worth the acting seems well done but it can't save it for me. This game's PC release is a perfect example of why pre-ordering is bad. Poor performance even on high-end rigs, massively broken at times (just look it up on YouTube) and essential things like fast-travel for let's say controlled districts are missing from the game. Other 'necessary' options like re-assigning districts are missing too, although a maybe understandable design choice. Even tiniest issues like other-region keyboards being properly supported (on a German keyboard the game will tell me to press Y when it should be Z and vice versa) will not get fixed. No option to disable auto-centering of the camera while driving. Even such long time after release the poor performance and unfixed major bugs make this a horrible game to have bought. Instead of fixes we get skins. Highly doubt the release of more DLC is going to make me reinstall the game again unless some major patches get released as well. (if you made it this far you probably should have read a different review, I'm not good at this and just doing it for the Autumn sale rewards lol)
12522	Mafia III was annouced on July 28, 2015. It is now the release date and there is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing 30 FPS cap?! Come on 2K this is BS. I'd recommend you wait until they patch it so we get above the 30 FPS cap... I know this just sounds like a review about the frame rate but not only that my fellow Mafia fans.... THE TEXTURES LOOK LIKE DIRT   Please don't do what I did and waste your birthday money on this..  I was so hyped for this game you don't even know... To be let down like this is just depressing.   If they patch this and fix the cons I'll change my review.  
12523	-Graphics are garbage -30FPS (For now) -People spawning as you move/drive towards them -No expression/change on character (doesn't blink forever and doesn't move face)  -Good Storyline/outline of it -Morgan Freeman is apparently a character -Lincoln is buff as â¥â¥â¥â¥ 
12524	Unplayable at the moment. My 6700k and GTX 1070 (latest driver) stutters every few seconds regardless of graphics setting at 1080P and 1440P. In fact, even the opening cinematic stuttered...... game is also installed on an SSD. Will update when patched.
12525	30 fps caps lock. Upscaled horrible textures. Lighting super bad, looks software based. Bad port, fu 2k. Refunding.
12526	This game is a slap on the face for pc players. I was a fool for pre-ordering this game. If I wanted to play this â¥â¥â¥â¥ at 30 fps I would have bought the ps4.  If the game would be locked at 30 fps then it should have been announced before. I wouldn't have bother pre-ordering or buying the game.   Producers are developers, PC is a different plaform. So, don't try to shove down what you make for console onto pc gamers. If you wanna be par across platform just make games for consoles. Don't even bother with PC games.

12532	Game Is not A complete pile of Trash...   But It has allot of problems. First thing is that It tries to much to be a open world map yet It fails as there's nothing to do.. No reason to fix cars or guns and cash become meaningless.. I dont see why they did not just focuse on the action more. And make it in to story scenarios.. Would worked way better.. As getting around the map get's stall really quick.. And the Broken AI and uninteresting world doesn't help it much.. Damm I got more to do in Assassin Creed games.   I don't recommend this game.. And honestly.. The only good thing is that It's satisfying to shoot people, And the story is good.. But you lose interest in to all of it. .As the missions are repedetiv.. you do the same â¥â¥â¥â¥ the entire game.. never get anywhere.. you never become a crime boss.. Never gain any power.. you just the guy going around killing people..   And the AI is horrible.. Damm they dont flank.. they dont switch cover.. It feels like a 2013 game.. Except in graphic..Yet it feels like the game downgrade itself betwen cutscenes and actual gameplay.. Like It's trying to cheat on you.   5/10.. Mediocer game.
12533	Basically another GTA. IF you not tired already to drive here and there and do bunch of identical missions in identical buildings..... then go for it. Im 31- maybe im too old..... but GTA took everything out of this genre already. AI intellect also low. Cops are not fun... i don know - this is my first review ever - thats what i think.
12534	10 minutes into playing CRASHES- Are you serious? I don't care about the 30 FPS cap but hot damn 10 minutes and a crash
12535	Nothing To Say At This Point...    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixlszwKVVP0 
12536	10 minutes into playing CRASHES- Are you serious? I don't care about the 30 FPS cap but hot damn 10 minutes and a crash
12537	Nothing To Say At This Point...    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixlszwKVVP0 
12538	I know it was you, 2K. You broke my heart. You broke my heart.
12539	My eyes are getting â¥â¥â¥â¥ed! 30fps is bs! Story is great btw :) Patch the game and you get a thumbs up. After bioshock remasterd and this i see that 2k only care for that console cash  After patch:  Broken mess! GTX 1080 can barely hold the game above 60 fps at high setting with awefull textures. Turned it down to medium settings and the game crashed seconds after! Stay away from this game until a real fix arrives.
12540	I was so damn hyped for this game, which makes it an even bigger let-down. Not only were there immense technical issues at launch, there's also a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ of bugs and missions that do, for some reason, not trigger for me.
12541	Giving this a negative review so as to the fact that the controls are the clunkiest â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ ever. Like seriously im in the second mission and my sneak button doesnt work. I switched it from x to c and then to left ctrl and thenback to x again and still i am not allowed to sneak. Am i doing something wrong? other than that the game is fine. good story music and all above but graphics wise, eh it can be tweaked a bit higher
12542	Boring and repetitive.  Same mission again and again.  Same dudes everywhere.  Same locations over and over.  At least combat feels nice. Port is bad as well. To few options and graphics suck.
12543	I loved Mafia 1 &amp; 2 but boy is this a disapointment. Should not have been called Mafia 3, has next to nothing to do with the mafia, story/telling which made the other 2 games just plain sucks, graphics are bad, mini map hopeless, stealth kills are poor like the rest of the game. If it had more polish and was called something else then maybe it would be worth a look but a Mafia game this aint.   TLDR, look else where.
12544	Playing the game Lincoln goes to sleep, game crashed took that as a sign, go to sleep wait for a patch
12545	  EDIT: I DID NOT RECIEVE THIS FOR FREE  Bad port.   Shame really because the game has tremendous potential. Yet, the game in its current state is â¥â¥â¥â¥.   The game is a gem sure, but it is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ covered gem.   Wait to buy this game. It is not worth the full price in its current state.
12546	i dont know what the hell is up with the graphics and the frame cap so far the story is good but everything else about the game is just off. hopefully they fix this â¥â¥â¥â¥ cause im kinda â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off that this game looks like this. last gen consoles had better graphics then this game.
12547	Mafia 3 The game is NOT optimized for PC, 30fps cap then now no gpu can do 60fps 1920x1080. The graphics is really bad in-game but the cutscenes are pretty good.  The missons are repetitive doing all the same again and again. Driving is bad if you click 'D' the car will fly away. The gunfights are ok.  The story is really blend but the last 20 min of the game is really good.  4.5/10
12548	Did i ever tell you the definition of insanity? it's doing the same â¥â¥â¥â¥ mission over and over
12549	  Boring gameplay, always repeat same mission. All the building also same. Never buy this game.
12550	Sorry to say (write) this but I regret buying the Mafia 3.  The story and the atmosphere of New Bordeau is cool, the music and voiceacting is top notch but the graphics and the bugs are just too much...  The graphic does not look to good but I do not have a big problem with it unless it's not running smoothly - and this is bad. I have a i5 - 4590 with Asus GTX 970 and 8GB RAM so it's not PC MasterRace but still decent enough. It seems it does not matter do I use a max or min settings - the graphic always does not feel smooth, like it's loosing framerate here and there for a spilt of a second - you cannot say it freezes on you but you still know there is something funny going.  If the game will be patched and like 50% off with all future DLC it's propably worth it but when I paid the whole pirce right now I feel like I tossed my money to the mud and could just go with GTA 5.  I now understand the comments about Mafia 2 being better even after 6 years apart from this Mafia.  In current state it's a 5 out of 10 - average at best.
12551	Wow,  Never thought I'd be so disappointed with a title that I'd feel the need to voice it.   IMHO the game is not ready and unplayable at this moment. It looks like the producer of the game balantly lured people into a typical honey trap - I tried playing on i7-3820@4.2ghz, 32GB Ram, GTX1070 with the game on Intel SSD 750. The game graphic-wise looks worse than old GTA titles and still glitches and smudging/blur on the screen all the time... Very very poor...:(  How do refunds work ? I played the game for a very short time and am not planning to play it again. Is there an option on Steam to do that or do I have to conact the developer/producer ?
12552	It Doesn't Start! Start -&gt; BlackScreen-&gt; Windows -&gt; No error report  I have the latest driver and hardware!
12553	Update: The UI issue seems to only be in the prologue. The frame dips are caused by collision issues, mostly with NPC cars crashing into or through each other and somehow ending up halfway in the floor. The NPCs are extremely buggy, especially civilians and cops driving. I've noticed sometimes, all of the NPCs will randomly just start driving around in circles. When this happens, they all do it, not just one. The GPS is also garbage. It frequently directs you to an inaccessible route, such as through a building you can't break. Cars randomly spawn. I had one car spawn on top of mine. I had a car spawn on a road close enough that if I hadn't been extremely careful in the first place, I probably would have hit it and killed myself. The gameplay is almost decent.On hard, the combat feels almost great. The shooting, for the most part, feels sufficiently brutal, but the melee kills feel lacking. The AI is terrible, making stealth ridiculously easy. Unlike Mafia II, where there was an open world, but nothing to do but the story, Mafia III does a really good job of making the player go around the map and complete open world objectives in the manner they see fit. The game offers a lot of freedom. It seems it's an almost decent game that's completely ruined by a bad PC port.   This game is awful. Forget about the 60 fps patch. This game is a flaming pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥ all around. It looks pretty bad, and heats my PC up even more than GTA V, even though GTA is running at 2048x1152 on relatively high settings, and this was running at 1366x768 on low. It would run perfectly fine, albeit ugly, with a steady 60 fps, then dip into 20 with frame and audio stuttering, like playing games from the early 2000s sometimes do. The keyboard controls are horrendous. No 2 actions can be bound to the same key, my extra mouse buttons are not recognized, and actions like picking up bodies are seperate from interact. Sniper scope is also seperated from the aim key. The UI overlaps, so I was supposed to time pressing e to pry open a door, but the 'sweet spot' which indicates when I'm supposed to press e is hidden underneath a text box. This game looks to be solid, underneath the technical mess that makes it unplayable. I've already refunded my money.
12554	After so many years of waiting it's as though they have applied a Watch Dogs feel to the game. The graphics are nice in places but even now the Illusion engine from Mafia 2 is better. It has gone incredibly towards the arcade side, and not in a good way. Repetative gameplay that for me at least does not immerse me in the game, and I'm incredibly disappointed this was the end product. This is not Mafia and once again a company like this, takes what was a good franchise and goes in reverse.
12555	It's not a Mafia. Dead world, where all NPC, quests etc create with a 'Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V'. Save your money, ignore this 'product'.

12557	AD3  I`v finished the game before(I`m assuming it will get patched eventualy) it Was patched, my recomendation wont be changed.  PS. i dont want to be offensive(I beg of you, really please dont take this the wrong way) but black people made gangs, not mafia....game feels more like Get Rich or die trying then The Godfather...   AD2  hotfix 1   game looks ok, big improvemend whitout blur  Still problems whit optimalisation but it`s getting better, if this get`s fixed I`l change my recomendation.  BTW game is really cool, repetative but very cool.  AD1   Fps unlocked but another problem surffed out, game is not optimased   Rear viev mirror should be an option and 99% it`s a preformance killer  Oryginal  I didn`t realize how awfull 30 fps until today... to think that people on consoles play games like this is...well i dont know where to even start(please dont take offence and sry for my english).  I`l change my recomendation once the patch is out and it works fine becouse for now game is unplayable for me.
12558	I shouldnt be called MAFIA III.....it insults the original MAFIA which was a flawed classic, even the boring MAFIA II  It should be called Disorganised Crime '' A poorly executed GTA clone''  That would have been more honest  PS The f*****ng skyboxes man, .... in 2016....
12559	My first review on this game was after 2 hours of gameplay, and I was really excited about it. But, after 53 hours of gameplay (I finished it only because I paid 50â¬ for it, and I didn't want to throw my money away), I really can't recommend this game (maybe on Christmas Sales), because it is unfinished and it's an insult to the Mafia series.  I'm giving you my pros and cons list.  Pros:  - Good music.  - Cool story.  - Well made cutscenes.  - â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s! (Playboy magazines)  Cons:  - A lot of graphical bugs (People flying 'The Exorcist' style, vehicles appearing out of nowhere, etc.).  - Really repetitive gameplay. You will get bored after taking over 3 rackets, because it is just hiding and whistling and stabbing over and over again.  - Mentally challenged AI, especially the police officers. Really, New Bordeaux PD must review their recruiting policy, because the stupidest people in the city are becoming cops.  - Big map without life or credibility. The devs haven't exploited the map at all.  - Car physics is abhorrent. You can ram into a tree at 120 mph and you won't even get a scratch on your car.  - No vehicle customization. You can't do things you could do on Mafia II, like open the trunk, fix the engine, and so on.
12560	This game is a monumental disaster zone, just another console ported sack of crap  COMPLAINT UNDER THE SALE OF GOODS ACT THIS GAME WILL BE RETURNED TO STEAM AS FAULTY, NOT FIT FOR USE  ***DO NOT BUY THIS GAME***
12561	Pretty disappointed, the whole game felt like a san andreas rip off with its colour coded districts depending on which underboss you give it to. The traffic system that they were talking about where you had to be careful about cops around was complete â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t I speed through red lights left and right while cops are just there looking at me and not doing anything.  Predictable and boring storyline, repetetive gameplay, no customization (upgrades dont count), boring cutscenes and a very small arsenal of guns and cars to choose from.   The game is way too short in my opinion, they tried to make the game feel longer by making you take over the whole map to progress til the end with boring cutscenes to make you feel like you accomplished something.  The only good thing i liked was the atmosphere, voice acting, driving and shooting mechanics.  All in all its a boring, repetitive and does not live up to the little hype it had
12562	Really boring.. Same â¥â¥â¥â¥ over and over.

The only good thing i liked was the atmosphere, voice acting, driving and shooting mechanics.  All in all its a boring, repetitive and does not live up to the little hype it had
12568	Really boring.. Same â¥â¥â¥â¥ over and over.
12569	This game is a monumental disaster zone, just another console ported sack of crap  COMPLAINT UNDER THE SALE OF GOODS ACT THIS GAME WILL BE RETURNED TO STEAM AS FAULTY, NOT FIT FOR USE  ***DO NOT BUY THIS GAME***
12570	GLITCHES:  https://tdgameclub.com/mafia-3-game-graphical-glitches/   Really worst game ever... What a shame for a big company to produce this to Mafia title.. I have no crashes but only ingame bugs... Graphic is like better GTA 4 be smart and buy GTA 5 instead of this â¥â¥â¥â¥ (in this state)..
12571	They say don't buy games that aren't out yet but I was sure this would be good, if for nothing else but the story. (I loved the story of Mafia 2) Well I was wrong, what a waste of â¥â¥â¥â¥ing money, the AI is the worst I have every seen in a game. The story seems like it would be nice but you have to take such long breaks from it to 'Claim' districts, which gameplay is the same â¥â¥â¥â¥ing thing over and over again. Its just too bad really, the world they crafted is quite good, but the game itself is just lacking in too many departments for 2016. They took a huge step backwards on the customization such as outfits and car modding. Not to mention the cars will be moved from where you park them when you go inside certain buildings and the cars also barely show damage when you hit things. Their is just to much immersion breaking in this game. I will say they did a few things right, such as the soundtrack and when you're moving your character around with a controller the left thumbstick does it all, push slightly forward to walk, more for running, and click in to sprint, no smashing the 'A' button continually like some games. Thats really about it though. Bad game don't buy.
12572	Mediocre and Generic
12573	Like a lot of fans of the Mafia game I was hoping on a third run, so when they announced Mafia 3 I was so happy and could not wait to play the game.  But after running the game I was very disappointed, the game looks like they have not put any effort in at all. It looks like they have taken Mafia 2 and tried to update the graphics and failed. The graphics and sound are what you would expect from a 2006-2010 game release. The car sounds sound cheap and messy, I have no idea what the bang sound is from car and trucks as you brake and accelerate. If I was to score this mess Iout of 5 it would be 2. I would have expected this game to look alot more like GTA 5 graphices as it being a 2016 release.  Im happy I only payed Â£20 for this game and not 35-45 as its not worth that sort of money. If I put a price on it it would be Â£15.  Such a waste of a great game. Mafia 2 look alot better.  I marked as not recommended so you can make your own choice, Its playable and ok if you can look past the messy sound and texture quality,not the best version of the Mafia games.
12574	So where should I start? Nah I shouldnt. Mediocre game with horrible performance on my otherways decent PC and a mediocre storyline. Disappointed me a fair bit as I have been waiting for this release since I finished Mafia 2 back in 2013 :|
12575	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C32-MskAUk    https://youtu.be/4TR1NkLzNxc    https://youtu.be/tHgW6XebFv8    https://youtu.be/ixlszwKVVP0   Just another train wreck published by 2K Games, 2/10.
12576	Ugly! Bad optimzed! Crashes! Low content! Boring! There is no good idea in this game! Poor! Doesn't worth its price!
12577	This game is a monumental disaster zone, just another console ported sack of crap  COMPLAINT UNDER THE SALE OF GOODS ACT THIS GAME WILL BE RETURNED TO STEAM AS FAULTY, NOT FIT FOR USE  ***DO NOT BUY THIS GAME***
12578	My first review on this game was after 2 hours of gameplay, and I was really excited about it. But, after 53 hours of gameplay (I finished it only because I paid 50â¬ for it, and I didn't want to throw my money away), I really can't recommend this game (maybe on Christmas Sales), because it is unfinished and it's an insult to the Mafia series.  I'm giving you my pros and cons list.  Pros:  - Good music.  - Cool story.  - Well made cutscenes.  - â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s! (Playboy magazines)  Cons:  - A lot of graphical bugs (People flying 'The Exorcist' style, vehicles appearing out of nowhere, etc.).  - Really repetitive gameplay. You will get bored after taking over 3 rackets, because it is just hiding and whistling and stabbing over and over again.  - Mentally challenged AI, especially the police officers. Really, New Bordeaux PD must review their recruiting policy, because the stupidest people in the city are becoming cops.  - Big map without life or credibility. The devs haven't exploited the map at all.  - Car physics is abhorrent. You can ram into a tree at 120 mph and you won't even get a scratch on your car.  - No vehicle customization. You can't do things you could do on Mafia II, like open the trunk, fix the engine, and so on.
12579	Pretty disappointed, the whole game felt like a san andreas rip off with its colour coded districts depending on which underboss you give it to. The traffic system that they were talking about where you had to be careful about cops around was complete â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t I speed through red lights left and right while cops are just there looking at me and not doing anything.  Predictable and boring storyline, repetetive gameplay, no customization (upgrades dont count), boring cutscenes and a very small arsenal of guns and cars to choose from.   The game is way too short in my opinion, they tried to make the game feel longer by making you take over the whole map to progress til the end with boring cutscenes to make you feel like you accomplished something.  The only good thing i liked was the atmosphere, voice acting, driving and shooting mechanics.  All in all its a boring, repetitive and does not live up to the little hype it had
12580	Really boring.. Same â¥â¥â¥â¥ over and over.
12581	I got bored so quickly. the story is ok, but the repetetiveness of the missions is HIGH!
12582	Yup, this is a boring game.....
12583	Good story, outdated graphics, lots of bugs and repetitive as hell!!!
12584	I liked Mafia, LOVED Mafia II so I was hopeful in the lead up to this game and was let down. I finished the game a month ago... gameplay was broken then, so I just mainlined it for the cutscenes. My recommendation is just watch the cutscenes on Youtube or something. Save your money and your time, its too valuable. There's no reason to play the game for the story, gameplay is just too bad to justify any price.
12585	GO â¥â¥â¥â¥ YOURSELF HANGAR 13, don't ever make a new game.
12586	sky box looks like fermented sh*t 30fps lock on launch repetitive gamplay uninstalled after only 5 hrs but the main menu has all along the watchtower  4/10
12587	Couldnt run the the game well at all, low fps and crashes, dont like the new style of driving, dont like the repetitive game play and was quite disappointed overall, got a refund within a day.
12588	It's not the mafia game we all been waiting for, but it's still playable
12589	Repetitive, unpolished and a disappointment compared to its predecessor.
12590	Probably one of the worst games of 2016! The game has performace issues, tons of bugs and the mission design is sooo repetetive. 3/10
12591	I really wanted to like this game as I had the previous ones. Great music, characters, some good cutscenes......but its just SO BORING. I really wanted to beat it because I thought I cared about the characters.. But I just couldn't handle the boredom.  It's sad how generic Mafia seems now. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO COMPETE WITH GTA DONT EVEN TRY.  Recommended price: $30
12592	Overrated
12593	One word: repetitive.
12594	The first two installments were very much linear games with open world elements. It worked very well for them. And were immensely enjoyable. Mafia III on the other feels like a vastly empty open world with small missions located within it. A third of the time I'm Just driving through an empty world from point a to point b. I really tried to like this game, but 10 hours in, and I regret buying a physical copy of this. It's a really sad goodbye to a favorite franchise. Don't buy it. It feels like a try hard rip-off of GTA. Nothing like the original Mafia games.
12595	Whoever loved Mafia 1 and Mafia 2, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! its nothing but a disappointment...
12596	Even if this wouldnt be called 'Mafia' it still would have been a stale boring repetitive game on its own.   Pros:
12597	A poor game with rinse and repeat gameplay and a generic you were betrayed and left for dead story. I tried to force myself through it because it was decent at first but it is so mind numbingly boring.
12598	are you serious 30 fps wtf!!!  btw this game is really cool but still â¥â¥â¥â¥ you 2k
12599	Shame on you 2K. Betrayal, as it says on your game commercial.
12600	Game will not load. I press start in the launcher, I get black screen for 3 seconds then it crashes to desktop. Please fix, I want to play. I have no playtime, I cant believe steam records game time for crashing simulator.
12601	FOR NOW? HELL NO, 2K fks every PC gamers who gave high hope for this game, We wait it for 6 years, 6 â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ years and you dont think pc gamers can handle 60 fps? This is how you treat your customers? 2K FK YOUSELF!
12602	Bad game. Full of bugs, bad graphics with almost no settings, repetitive missions... Compared to Mafia 2 or even Mafia 1, this looks like the first game, not the last one.
12603	FIX THIS GAME FOR â¥â¥â¥â¥S SAKE Performance is still very bad and there are countless bugs, some of them even game breaking..  Without the black protagonist &amp; overall setting (which isn't even that creative nor fitting as a part of the Mafia franchise) this game would probably get publicly bashed for being the second worst title of 2016 after No Mans Sky. However the most annoying things missing are a Free Roam mode at the end (you wouldn't even have to add new missions, just let the players travel around freely in the world and collect those useless collectibles..) and a regular main menu, especially where you can look at your collectibles. And by the way: Why the â¥â¥â¥â¥ are there hundreds of those electric devices scattered throughout the City if you don't even need half of them? It's basically a complete waste of time to collect all of them. I know that the publisher probably forced this specific release date and the game wasn't truly finished yet, but how long have you worked on it, Mafia 2 came out in 2010, that's six long years.. and all the bad choices of things that are/aren't included in this game can't be explained by this circumstance.  Overall this game truly is a step back from Mafia 2, either they learned nothing from community feedback or simply chose to ignore it. As a fan of the Mafia series it is not recommended to buy this game in it's current state, however it is unlikely that everything gets fixed since many bugs in Mafia 2 also never got fixed and still exist..
12604	I was hoping not to give this game a bad review. But it featuring on the autumn sale gives me little to no choice. This game isn't close to acceptable. I can play it for an hour before getting too annoyed with all the flaws.  We're not talking about some small imperfections, it's glaring and annoying flaws in the game.  Don't buy this game. Just don't.
12605	So sad ,after the amazing mafia 2 this game is probably kill the mafia franchise ):
12606	This game starts out very promising, seeming similar to the linear gameplay that was mafia 2 Straight foward great story with great cut scenes. After the first hour or two the game opens up becoming a sequence of repetitive uninteresting side quests in order to develop the story. The Ai was simplistic and the great police system of Mafia 2 is gone. This game seems to suffer from the we need to open the game up and fill it with â¥â¥â¥â¥ to avoid the negative pre release publicity. It had so much potential but I can not reccomend it at a full price. Yes i got some sort of entertainment from it but would of rather i had waited for a sale
12607	Doesn't have ANY of the stuff that made Mafia 2 great. Not even the small things which could be so easy to make, such as cops ticketing you if you go too fast, trying to arrest you if you were too naughty, etc. Nope, the cops will just kill you if you ram into them like in GTA.   Can't go into various stores and buy something to drink or eat either. Nope, not even the ones that aren't segregated.   Driving physics suck.   Missions are EXTREMELY repetitive and boring. You literally do the same â¥â¥â¥â¥ over and over.  Terribly optimized. Can't reach 60 FPS (which is a bare â¥â¥â¥â¥ing minimum) on a GTX 1070, i5 6600K. Was even 30 FPS locked at release, that by it self is enough to give this game a red thumbs down.  Play Mafia 2, it even looks just as good as this game and is much better.
12608	it's not even 5 bucks worth....it's a shame. The game runs for an 1hr now and the only thing i've done is watch a cutscene, walk 5 steps, watch another cutscene, drove to a Bank, another cutscene, walk senseless around with nothing to do, watch a cutscene, killed 5 guards, watched another cutscene, walked into the bed, loading screen, watches another cutscene.  GG 2k! i bought a film for 50 bucks. well played....
12609	I nerver post commentary usualy. But this game deserve it. I play 65 min on this game and sorry but it's totaly garbage . No optimization . Low texture . 2K should delay the game on PC. I have a GTX 1070 who can run th witcher 3 full utlra +nvidia gameworks at 60fps in 1080p.  Mafia is again a good example to a bad optimisation title as Batman.  It's totaly not acceptable to sell a game like that.  I will wait few weeks to see if they will patch the game and maybe change my evaluation. Worst case ask for a refund !  But actually I advise people to don't buy it and wait some time.  By the way the story seems really good ! Sad to wait patch to play....  2k move your â¥â¥â¥!
12610	Horribly optimized and very monotonous. Don't be fooled by the two first hours. Afterwards it's just go here, do that, kill these guys, and go back. The only thing that the game really has going for itself is the story and music. But everything else is just mediocore. And well, it's just a hassle to play, no fun at all. Such a let down after Mafia 2!
12611	good story, but you have to play the boring missions to get to the good parts, and after there isn't anything to do apart from getting collectables and juction boxes or whatever. Its alright but mafia 2 is still way better.
12612	Mafia III... let's keep it short since the devs did not take their time with porting the game for PC decently as well!  The Bad - severe fps drops (down to 4-5) all the time - the minimum hardware demands do not make sense since my hardware is right in between min and max demands and I can't run it properly (running everything on low) - the game looks far 'worse' than GTA 5 (it is not ugly, though), but it runs like a rusty bike - highly repetetive missions you need to accomplish to unlock story missions - the underboss system is a hit and miss. Miss: You unlock certain perks/favours from underbosses but have to pay for those anyways. I wouldn't call those a favour then. Also, there is talk of loyalty while there is no indication on how loyal your underbosses are.  [EDIT]- your decision to whom to give a district to is based on an arbitrary skill tree linked to each underboss, so you don't decide on characteristics but on what you want to get out of them. This obviously kills the whole vibe of a possible brawl between underbosses - if an enemy becomes aware of you he is simply a bullet sponge - every main boss is a bullet sponge - alternative open world missions are highly repetetive - story-supporting missions which do not contribute to the main story are all the same: interrogate that thugh to get to the other thug to kill the third thug. All. The. Time. - hard difficulty is a joke - you can just run from so many situations whithout a scratch - the AI (in the open world) is terrible: 'Oh, there is a body... well, probably old age!' Or: 'I heard shots and found three dead guys. Better search for ten seconds, then let it go,... just because'. Yet they know exactly where you are when throwing explosives or shooting through thickest smoke or bushes. What a joke. - enemies have deadly precision over yours - witness system: Doesn't seem to work properly during open world missions. [EDIT]- you can't, like in Mafia 2, replay your missions by choosing them from a menue. Big disappointment right there. [EDIT]- damage model of cars is not as elaborate as in games comparable to this  The Good + story missions (non-open-worlded) work great and are fun (they are linear but they function as they should!) + video clips and actors play together very well + characters are believable + music is great + the problems of racism are adressed and you as the protagonist are to do something about it + the underboss system is a hit and miss. Hit: You can call in certain favours (hit squad, operator phone shut-off, call off police) so you need to decide wisely whom to give a district to. + witness system: when people see a crime they are likely to report you. Adds tension. + different enemy types: sentry, grunt, gunner, sniper + weapons have remarkably different attributes from accuracy over mag capacity to fire rate which actually have an impact on gun fights + gun fights feel amazin due to great sounds and impactful guns, especially shotguns [EDIT]+ elaborate city with a variety of locations and territorially distinguishable landscapes [EDIT]+ I stuck to the main story and it took me about 25-27 hours. Decent.  The Verdict Shame on the developer for dishing out such an unfinished, unpolished PC version of the game. Customers pay good, hard-earned money on your product, that has been out for 21 days now. No  efficient  fix has been issued. You took a franchise which started with a masterpiece, continued with a story-strong and combat-weak Mafia II and ended in this mess. It could've been fun if you did not count so much on open-worlded story supporting mission design, which is bound to be repetetive and if you actually postponed the release for the PC version to dish out an optimized game. You decided to go against your valued customers, take their money and only get around 50% approval rates. Deserved, in my opinion.  I can't recommend this game, especially not for Mafia lovers like me. It is like with the movies - sloppy seconds are bad. Third parts following there are almost always utter garbage.
12613	AAA price for Indie gameplay.
12614	DO NOT BUY. Horrible game, â¥â¥â¥â¥ game on console that was made 10x worse by a crap pc porting. completly unplayable
12615	Bad PC Port despite the first patch. I have a i7-4790K, 32GB Ram, R9 390 Nitro..but the game still looks awful...even Witcher 3 and GTA V looking miles better... all is somewhat angular especialy the figures.. and one thing that really drives me mad: NO â¥â¥â¥â¥ing way to hard save..
12616	Edit 09/11/16 Patch - Runs even worse than before post patch   Another shoddy AAA port.  980ti 6600k 16GB RAM Installed on an 850 EVO SSD  Can't even sustain 40fps
12617	Bad game. Full of bugs, bad graphics with almost no settings, repetitive missions... Compared to Mafia 2 or even Mafia 1, this looks like the first game, not the last one.
12618	FIX THIS GAME FOR â¥â¥â¥â¥S SAKE Performance is still very bad and there are countless bugs, some of them even game breaking..

12621	Game will not load. I press start in the launcher, I get black screen for 3 seconds then it crashes to desktop. Please fix, I want to play. I have no playtime, I cant believe steam records game time for crashing simulator.
12622	This game is just plain bad. I had so much expectations since I loved its prequels, However this games didnt deliver any of that.  1. The game is overly repetitive. Main missions and side missions are pretty much all the same. All you gotta do is drive to different locations and do the same **** over and over again for endless hours. Level designer should be fired for doing this,  2. Game has a nice storytelling, but the story itself sucks monkey â¥â¥â¥.  3. A.I. of this game is probably one of the worst in recent games. All you need is a pistol w/ silencer and they will have no clue where u are. If you are expecting a gun fight like the ones you see in gang movies, you are badly mistaken. This game is more like assassin's creed style, but 100 times worse.  4. Stupid Bugs- there are tons of minor bugs that ruins game experience. and most of these bugs could be found by simple playthroughs. QA failed big time on this one.
12623	Capped at 60fps - played at 40-50fps. Capped at 30fps - played at 20fps  It looks like a water painting, but I think I insulted water painting. Its was made in MS Paint.
12624	It's not a bad game. The gameplay isn't bad; the story isn't bad. If you took the first 2 or 3 hours, stripped the next bloated 15-20 hours down to just the necessary four or five, and kept the last hour or two as-is, you'd have a downright fantastic game. But as it stands, Mafia III is as repetitive as daily suburban life and it's far, far too stretched out to justify recommending. At its core, it's a ten-hour game that drags on twice as long as it has any right to. It is not engaging enough to warrant the nine separate districts that you have to go through one-by-one doing the exact same boring things until you finally get to the part where you kill the district's captain in an actually interesting mission. Oh, and it does that thing where you're not allowed to turn off tutorial prompts, so it keeps interrupting gameplay to remind you of features that you've been using the whole game, even when you're in free-roam after the ending.
12625	setting all HIGH look very BAD
12626	Sad to see that a game and a Franchise that was so hyped up just â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ itself on release day can't believe writing a bad review for this game is what im doing, but the game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ right now. Dumb how console players get the full experience and we get dog â¥â¥â¥â¥. Shame.
12627	It'd be great if I could even get the game running but as I've seen on several forums, it's apparently a broken game. I try to launch the game and I get the launcher then try to hit play and Boom. It doesn't launch. HUGE disappointment. I love the Mafia series but the fact that I can't even get it running when it's been out for a whole fricken month is just unacceptable. I've tried every approach that others have recommended, making sure my drivers are properly updated, re-installing the game, restarting my computer, everything that I can think of and everything that's been suggested. This was supposed to be an anniversary gift to me and now it's been crapped on by my inability to even get it started.
12628	after running 30 mins of the game. the game's not working. please fix this issue!
12629	The incompetence of Hanger 13 is truly unprecedented for a AAA title. I played 30+ hours with a few crashes here and there but nothing serious. That all changed with the most recent update - the one from October 14th; it completely tanked my game. Not only can I no longer achieve a stable 60fps, I'm getting blue screen crashes now. Do you know how terrible a game has to be to cause BSOD's? The absolute lack of technical talent involved in this game blows my mind. This franchise deserved so much better. I now have a season pass I'll never be able to use because I can't play the game longer than twenty minutes before my computer crashes into blue screen. The error has to do with an outdated graphics driver - I've reinstalled the most recent Nvidia driver three times. It's definitely on the games side because, again, I played the game for nearly forty hours with only two or three crash to desktops before the most recent patch, all on the same GPU driver. They did something on their side to make the game think the driver is outdated and hard crash to blue screen. It's truly incredible how pathetic Hanger 13 is. They have no idea what they're doing over there.   Even without the hard crashes, the fact that 2K allowed this game to release in the condition it's in is audacious. It's so poorly optimized that my GTX 1070 rarely exceeds 30% usage. Before the October 14th patch, I was able to get a solid 60fps 3/4 of the time with a combination of low/medium settings but, again, the most recent patch screwed the game up so much that, even with all settings on low, I'm getting dips below 30fps now and rarely even touch 60 frames. That never happened before. I don't know who they have working at Hanger 13 but they need to be banned from the industry. It's sad because, creatively, it's not a bad game. While it's certainly redundant, no other game offers this time period and attention to detail. So I have no other game to play to enjoy the 1960's, one of my favorite time periods. I also appreciate the realism and attention to detail. GTA is great and all but some of the cars are so cartoonish and the map is boring. The Mafia franchise has always been grounded in realism appose to other open world games and Mafia 3 lightly carries on that tradition. The Mafia franchise is one of my favorites so for this disgusting studio to have ruined it really chaps my â¥â¥â¥. I wish the guys who made Mafia 2, 2K Czech, had made this game too; they would have done it justice.   There honestly needs to be some type of commission to investigate situations like this. Studio's should be fined when they advertise a working game, only to have it be a piece of dog sh*it upon release. I'm a pretty patience and understanding person - the 30fps lock didn't even bother me too long because Hanger 13 released the patch that unlocked the framerate literally the following day of the games release. So, while it wasn't a big deal, it was an indication of how terrible the game performs. And for them to release a patch that not only makes performance worse but actually tanks your game... I can't even. I'm done. There's just no excuse for this level of incompetence.
12630	horrible graphics looks like it was made 5 years ago , no sli support, crashing, boring ,repetitive (main mission feels like side missions), and the ai is â¥â¥â¥â¥  The only thing that is good about this game is the story videos and the soundtrack Dont buy it just watch walkthrough on youtube and listen to the soundtrack on youtube
12631	A poor game with rinse and repeat gameplay and a generic you were betrayed and left for dead story. I tried to force myself through it because it was decent at first but it is so mind numbingly boring.

I try to launch the game and I get the launcher then try to hit play and Boom. It doesn't launch. HUGE disappointment. I love the Mafia series but the fact that I can't even get it running when it's been out for a whole fricken month is just unacceptable. I've tried every approach that others have recommended, making sure my drivers are properly updated, re-installing the game, restarting my computer, everything that I can think of and everything that's been suggested. This was supposed to be an anniversary gift to me and now it's been crapped on by my inability to even get it started.
12636	Bad news is good news when making money, locked 30fps is a marketing tactic to get the word out. For example look how Apple, Nvidia, Sony launch a product they intentionally limit the first batch of a product to half or less so it's immediately sold out, This builds scarcity and value in Sheeples little minds about this product, in other words builds Hype.  However, with software publishers for gaming the marketing tactic trend is to have a broken game at launch.....
12637	What the hell this game isn't even starting up. The little mini menu for the game pops up and I pretty start and it looks like it's about to start and than it goes black screen and than just exits back to the desktop. And for a few seconds in the steam library it says the game is running but than it stops and nothing happens. It isn't working for me. Is anyone else having this problem? if so please tell me. and if you can please tell me how to fix it if it can be fixed.
12638	Shortly, DO NOT BUY for PC. Not up to 2016 standards. Everything maxed out and it just doesn't look good, lots of bugs and the 'open' world is very limited. Combat is very easy and boring even on hard and sneaking is so easy that a knife is the only weapon needed is most 'fights'. Only good thing is the story, but even that is let down by the way too easy combat...
12639	This fell way below expectations   -WORSE PHYSICS THAN OVER 10 YEARS AGO -30 FPS.......  -MAJOR WEATHER GLITCHES....  -ALL AI, movement, driving+shooting physics are EXTREMELY DATED  -POP UP.  REFUND.
12640	Update: So still keeping this negative untill bugs have been fixed that said i by now have a bit better idea of the game  the good thinks: ohh those are a bit hard .. story is pretty well done the same goes for character animations, Cops are pretty hard to evade, Its definitly not a bad game it has its upsite.  the bad thinks: this one is a bit larger, Bugs are one reason, there are several i have encounterd and only once they helped me, else they f**** me over. I had several crashes on the start of a cutscene ( important story thinks i would guess) when i restarted the game i could not see them because the game automaticly jumped over this letting me wonder what just happent and how the hell did i get here. Then well there is the thinks. i expected more from the 3rd game but got way less.. its not to bad since its about the main story of the game and that is good, but its about those small thinks .. i know i could use my turn lights in the old mafia games and needed to fuel my car, you cant do this anymore they basicly removed small but cool thinks and did not realy add any new thinks. There are stores in game but beside robbing there cash register ( the owner does not mind you doing that) you cant do anything in it .. the game does not really feels like a mafia game to me.. maybe its because you are fighting the mafia but still. The worst thinkg though so far.. this game seems to be done with console in mind first not taking anygood care of the pc verions resulting in bad menu controlss ( they are pretty bad really) Car driving is .. well â¥â¥â¥â¥ ( you cant drive with ease anymore like the old games and obay the traffic laws)     Well again the story is pretty well done but controlls are just terrible its clear this is a console port. graphics options are also pretty .. naaa bad. so is it a worth to buy? maybe .. this game is way more worth 60$ than no mans sky is but it has so many downsites right now.If they fix most of the stuff yes. if not then no. Graphics are also not impressing, its clear that this game suffers by being a cheap console port, i suspect thats also the reason why there are so many bugs and cashes right now. again the story is still well done and you have good freedom to do your missions like you like. and i like going stealth and this is pretty good possible =)    So yes you can buy it but be carefully and think this over 2-3 times about what kind of a person you are
12641	excepted much more of this game. the game wasnt ready for release got soo many problems... Graphical Glitches. Game Crashes wayy too often. action buttons on screen shows duplicated. 30 fps ? Are you kidding me ? YOU THINK IM A CONSOLE PEASENT. ALREADY Ashamed i preordered.
12642	The incompetence of Hanger 13 is truly unprecedented for a AAA title. I played 30+ hours with a few crashes here and there but nothing serious. That all changed with the most recent update - the one from October 14th; it completely tanked my game. Not only can I no longer achieve a stable 60fps, I'm getting blue screen crashes now. Do you know how terrible a game has to be to cause BSOD's? The absolute lack of technical talent involved in this game blows my mind. This franchise deserved so much better. I now have a season pass I'll never be able to use because I can't play the game longer than twenty minutes before my computer crashes into blue screen. The error has to do with an outdated graphics driver - I've reinstalled the most recent Nvidia driver three times. It's definitely on the games side because, again, I played the game for nearly forty hours with only two or three crash to desktops before the most recent patch, all on the same GPU driver. They did something on their side to make the game think the driver is outdated and hard crash to blue screen. It's truly incredible how pathetic Hanger 13 is. They have no idea what they're doing over there.   Even without the hard crashes, the fact that 2K allowed this game to release in the condition it's in is audacious. It's so poorly optimized that my GTX 1070 rarely exceeds 30% usage. Before the October 14th patch, I was able to get a solid 60fps 3/4 of the time with a combination of low/medium settings but, again, the most recent patch screwed the game up so much that, even with all settings on low, I'm getting dips below 30fps now and rarely even touch 60 frames. That never happened before. I don't know who they have working at Hanger 13 but they need to be banned from the industry. It's sad because, creatively, it's not a bad game. While it's certainly redundant, no other game offers this time period and attention to detail. So I have no other game to play to enjoy the 1960's, one of my favorite time periods. I also appreciate the realism and attention to detail. GTA is great and all but some of the cars are so cartoonish and the map is boring. The Mafia franchise has always been grounded in realism appose to other open world games and Mafia 3 lightly carries on that tradition. The Mafia franchise is one of my favorites so for this disgusting studio to have ruined it really chaps my â¥â¥â¥. I wish the guys who made Mafia 2, 2K Czech, had made this game too; they would have done it justice.   There honestly needs to be some type of commission to investigate situations like this. Studio's should be fined when they advertise a working game, only to have it be a piece of dog sh*it upon release. I'm a pretty patience and understanding person - the 30fps lock didn't even bother me too long because Hanger 13 released the patch that unlocked the framerate literally the following day of the games release. So, while it wasn't a big deal, it was an indication of how terrible the game performs. And for them to release a patch that not only makes performance worse but actually tanks your game... I can't even. I'm done. There's just no excuse for this level of incompetence.
12643	Edit 09/11/16 Patch - Runs even worse than before post patch   Another shoddy AAA port.  980ti 6600k 16GB RAM Installed on an 850 EVO SSD  Can't even sustain 40fps
12644	FPS limit?!? horrible graphics, bugs, storyline with thousands of cut scenes which try to cover the go and kill only game.  The first and second Mafias were splendid, but this. not. sorry.  i7 1080
12645	This game is made to run in 30FPS for the console inferiors. If you unlock the 30FPS cap there is no way you are gonna reach the 60FPS in most places because they didnt care to optimize the game.  If you dont mind playing games that run like slideshows than its fine i suppose.
12646	Author's Note: Don't judge this review by the time I've spent on the PC version of this game. I bought it on the PC when it first came out, knowing that it probably wouldn't run on my PC, I was right. So, I decided to get it for the Xbox One. I won't really be able to cover any PC glitches or anything of that nature, but I can give you my opinion on the game. So, here we go.   After playing Mafia II, I had high hopes for this game. I heard that the story was great and that the soundtrack was amazing. Sadly though, it didn't meet my hopes.   The game is set in 1968, in the fictional city in Louisiana called 'New Bordeaux' (Which is basically New Orleans). You play as Lincoln Clay, a man who just got back from the war in Vietnam. All's well in his life until tragedy strikes and Lincoln is out for revenge. Now, I do admit that the story is pretty darn good! It's probably the best thing going for it. If you've played the previous game, you'll also recognize some people. The new characters are also interesting.   After the story, though, things start to get a little average. If you couldn't tell already, this game is a third person shooter, just like the rest of the series. There are a multitude of guns in your arsenal, available to purchase in-game. There's pistols, snipers, shotguns, automatic guns, and more. The shooting in this game isn't anything new, if you've played any third person shooter, you've probably played this one too.   Being that this is an open world game, there is also driving. Now, the cars in this game look pretty sweet, but the driving isn't anything new either. Once again, if you've played an open world game with cars, you've probably played this one too. The one plus with the driving is the radio. The soundtrack has some great hits from the era and do make driving worth it!   Here's where it drops more...the missions. If you've ever read a review on this game, you probably already know this. The missions are all basically the same. You either kill someone or you destroy something...yep. When I first started, I was excited about the missions. I do admit that they're pretty fun, but they get old FAST. It came to the point where I was so lazy that I just got the sniper, drove to a vantage point, parked the car, got out, sniped the target, and drove off. You can stealth-kill targets, which can be fun, but it just gets mundane. Mission after mission of the same thing. Back in Mafia 2, missions felt more unique. Sure, you had your shoot-outs, but there were some great missions! Now, there are some unique missions, but most of your time will be spent doing the same interrogation animation 12 times, killing one fool several times, or smashing up something.   One of the goals of the game is to take over the map, and that is done by completing missions. When this is done, you can assign pieces to your three lieutenants and it's done by holding a meeting. Giving pieces of land and completing missions for any of your lieutenants can give you access to new stuff, such as weapons. Doing the missions though means more of the same stuff. Overall, I thought this system was fairly cool, but it still makes you do the same old missions.   Another thing to note is the graphics. The in-game graphics are pretty good, but sometimes seem a little lack luster. The cut scene graphics though are extremely well done and the whole thing feels like a documentary you'd find on the History Channel. Also, when you're not killing targets or busting up places, there's also collectables to be had, different cars, and clothes to buy. Other than the missions, though, there's not much to do.   In the end, Mafia 3 turned out to be a decent game, due to its story, music, and amazing cut scene graphics. Mafia 3 doesn't do a good job in terms of being the next installment to Mafia 2. If you're looking to buy this, I'd say wait for it to go down to $20, at the very most. $15 dollars would be more ideal though and if you're truly looking for that mafia experience, stick with the first two games.   
12647	Been broken since release, last update made the fps more stable. Recent patch broke it again. Running a i7 6700k and a gtx1070 and still drops down to 47fps!! Run games like gta5, witcher 3 at 100++ fps. And then there is this repetitive story. Meet a new client, do some damage to some people, â¥â¥â¥â¥ off the boss, kill the boss, repeat 6-8 times and the game is done. Story in mafia 2 was great, one of my favourite games. Mafia 3 is horrible. 2k should just leave it, appologise to the fans and start over totally from scratch. Total waste of money.
12648	I finished the game.  Each racket you take down is the same thing. You go around robbing and stealing from the boss' workers and factories, causing damage. Then they get â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off, show up to the place you just robbed and you kill them.  The repetitiveness is a pretty huge downside to the game, and for that I'd say keep your money.  I do strongly believe that they did an awesome job on the story telling and cut scenes.. but I'm paying for a game, not a movie.
12649	F*ck me man, this game was a horrible expirience. I dont know about any other game that's this repetitive and so boring to play. I had to force myself to finish this game, and after 24 painfull hours i finally did it.  . . . definetly wasn't worth it
12650	The Bots are dimwitted in This Game . They Look aT You And after I think 100 Year BanG .... They shoot At You ! The Main characters are Soooooooooooo Ugly. ( Except Vito ) â¦You Can't Change Your Clothes . â¦You Can't Fast Travel. â¦You Can't Have Some Fun Becuase There is No Fun in This Game. Just Kill , Drive , Drive , Kill ........ â¦You Can't Eat anythinG , You Can't Drink anythinG ( it's Not Like a Real Life ) â¦Some Pic of Playboy magazine Are From Mafia || .  â¦etc........  But I admit The Music Is Cool and awsome .  
12651	Afther I changed the kaymapping a bit, almost every button stopped working, and I can only sprint around. Some bugs are expected, but a tripple-A game should be playable at launch. Please give me some advise if anyone of you have solved the same problem.
12652	CURRENTLY UNPLAYABLE FOR ME. Player is stuck in starting position stood like a lemon. (See Screen Shot) , Currently trying to fix but at this moment in time its a waste of money.  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=776391740 
12653	I need to get something off my chest, I cannot believe how some of you fanboys are defending this game. I understand you are trying to justify and defend your purchase but god damn, the amount of hate being thrown at others for simply stating facts that this game is abosolute â¥â¥â¥â¥ in terms of optimizations.  To the people that don't have any issue, just because your game works DOES NOT MEAN IT DOESNT WORK FOR OTHERS.  This game was rushed, it was a â¥â¥â¥â¥ console port and once again PC players get the long â¥â¥â¥â¥ stuck up our â¥â¥â¥.   Now that they released an uncapped framerate in the latest patch the game still can't run at 60 FPS.   I have a 980 and the game can't even run it at 60 FPS at 1080p or 1440p  The graphics are â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥, low res and blurry.  The game crashes often, I played it for an hour before it crashed on me like 5 times.  The AI is dumb as â¥â¥â¥â¥  Glitches out the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥   Just giving some points here the game runs â¥â¥â¥â¥ing horrible and I still cant believe people take this â¥â¥â¥â¥, REFUND THE GAME and get your money back, its not worth waiting this poorly optimized game to get patched.   I can't believe people are like looking for mods and other ways to get the game run better, WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT, the game should be released in great state for us so we can play and mod it later if we want to enhance the experience.  THIS IS A WARNING TO PEOPLE THINKING ABOUT GETTING THE GAME, DO NOT BUY IT IN ITS CURRENT STATE. THE STORY LOOKS GREAT BUT THE GAME RUNS LIKE HORSE â¥â¥â¥â¥.  SEND A MESSAGE WITH YOUR WALLET, PC PLAYERS DO NOT DESERVE THIS CRAP ANYMORE.
12654	This game sucks. Check the videos comparing it to the mafia 1&amp;2....
12655	So boring after the first few hours.  This isn't mafia.
12656	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing disgrace to the Mafia series...
12657	game play is repetive
12658	it feels like im playing a bad console port, there is just no love in this game. its â¥â¥â¥â¥ :'(
12659	So far, first patch weekend after release, I'm expericing more issues than pre-patch. Suddenly getting a lot of hitching on my reasonably high end PC.  Frame rates don't bother me, but I'd rather it ran smoothly at 30 than all over the place at unlimited and hitching at 60.  I am experiencing crashes too, and for a game without quick save that is a pain.  That being said the game is fun. If you liked Mafia II you will like this. The world is bigger, the voice acting is good, and it is a lot of fun to play when it works.  But if performance is valued over all else, wait to buy this. Fingers crossed a few more patches will straighten it out. So for now, I'm leaving a negative review.
12660	Mafia 3 was the game that I was the most exited to play during 2016. From the first trailer I was immediately hooked and having played Mafia 2, I knew this had to be good. Sadly, I am very disappointed at how this game has been released unfinished and broken. Here's a list of problems that are occuring in my game and I assume other's games aswell.  -horrible AI (both enemies and civilians) -very strange looking weather effects -insane amount of pop-in for almost all textures -broken lighting effects which also ties into the weather effects -lagging like crazy even on low settings and after the fps cap patch -crashing if I move the camera around too fast   Now here's another problem that I have been experiencing that I haven't seen many other people have but if the devs so read this review please fix this weird glitch. Now when I began playing the game, everything seemed normal. Nothing odd or unusual (aside from the list above). I was just exploring the river in a boat when I saw a boat at a dock suddenly shoot up into the air. This caused my game to crash and force my computer to have to reset itself. After this I began experiencing the same phenomenon but with cars. Some would crash the game, others would just cause me to go under around 5 fps. After doing some missions while trying to cope with these flying vehicles every so often, I noticed that at most road intersections, there would be a massive line of cars waiting for a destroyed car sitting in the middle of the intersection. Cars would sometimes just slam into these destroyed cars and eventually, blow up. The traffic AI became absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥ after I started noticing cars driving in circles going 50 mph defying the laws of physics and glitching through walls and other objects that they weren't supposed to be clipping through and then eventually, blowing up. I am not going to play this game until the devs do something to fix the mess of a game they have on their hands at the moment. As for now, I cannot recomend this game to anyone (at least on PC) until it is fixed.
12661	Ok let me start that the story is great but anything else is stupid.I started the franchise from Mafia one to Mafia 2 and now this.Let me tell you they removed everything we loved from the game and gave us this hunky dory steaming â¥â¥â¥â¥. First lets go for pros and cones  Pros~ -Great story ~Great soundtrack ~Good animation ~good facial expressions  Cons~ ~30fps on launch just why ?You stupid ? patcehes it in but why would you cap it from the first place ? ~Graphics is dog â¥â¥â¥â¥ this is 2016 the excuse that graphics mean nothing is plain idiotic and you're giving them excuses for their lack of trying ~Removed car and clothing customization but putting as a patch but why is it a patch and not implementing it in the game ?6 years this game has been under development and this is what they did ? ~you can't drink or eat anything don't know if thats gonna be in a patch ~â¥â¥â¥â¥ skyboxes,lighting,rendering and textures and I'm on high with a good pc â¥â¥â¥â¥ off you dumb peasants ~driving is mediocre no just NO.WHAT IS WRONG WITH 13 HANGER ?Maybe they shouldn't touch anything that they can't handle remember the first demo they showed us movie like car on car explosions ?They wanted that but removed it but left us with â¥â¥â¥â¥ car handling its just stupid even simulation is stupid ~No need of fuel WHY ?We loved that about the damn game why would you remove that ? ~physics and destruction there is none I was going 80 km/h and rammed a truck head on my car was fine and I lost some health ~AI is beyond stupid trust me they make ubisoft AI look smart  ~No bloody foot prints yep you heard it right I walk on blood nope nothing Mafia 1 has better than this ~No immersion is absolutely DEAD only thing that works is the word nigge r and people looking at you Everything else you can find it here  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZokdmzvDGA    IT'S STILL â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ DON'T GET IT AND DOWN WITH HANGER 13
12662	Do not, I repeat do not buy this game. If you like it pirate it, spend some time and enjoy it. Maybe sometime later when it will cost 10 euro it will be worth it. I sadly bought this game not from steam so I am stuck with it. The graphics are horrible, saints row 4 tier. (except for facial animations, those are wonderful) story is good, music is great, gunplay and some gameplay innovations like smart and agressive cops and their tactics are nice but otherall it's a horrible downgrade from mafia 2. Mafia 2 back in its day looked amazing and had an amazing engine which was pushing the boundaries. It wasn't gta IV but it was a totally different beast. More gruesome, more realistic, more... ''mature''. Mafia 3 is just gta V but a lot worse in every possible aspect.
12663	Play Mafia II instead. Or GTA 5. They are far more better games instead of this. Storytelling on Mafia III is excellent. Kinda like the story itself. But, experience from graphics and amount of fun by playing of this game is very limited. So your PC will perform super on MAFIA 2 on max settings. On Mafia 3 will do only the middle settings with far worse visual experience in my opinion. Both games finished on my Y50-70 laptop with i7,16Gb RAM and gtx860m
12664	Disappointing.  Not good, very repetetive, not half the game Mafia 2 was.  I'm actually surprised they managed to â¥â¥â¥â¥ it up this badly.  Most of the time missions are the same â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥ over and over again with different paint jobs.  Don't buy it.  
12665	Don't waste your money on this crap.
12666	Dont buy this game ! Poorly optimization.
12667	After 26 hours of play(not continuously obviously) the game blue screened my comp (havent seen one of those for about 10 years!!) When I logged back in I got a corrupt save message. I Oked that assuming it meant the last save. When I restarted the game it had erased everything and I could only start at the beginning again!! Seriously â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off. My rig is running fine in every other aspect with other games and tasks etc so this is solely down to Mafia 3!! A total waste of time and effort Dont bother!!
12668	Ok let me start that the story is great but anything else is stupid.I started the franchise from Mafia one to Mafia 2 and now this.Let me tell you they removed everything we loved from the game and gave us this hunky dory steaming â¥â¥â¥â¥.

12669	aaand yet another open world with nothing to do, absolutely no replay value, questionable game mechanics, and just general lack of simulated criminality, just your average shoot em click through.  Only would suggest buying this on sale. like 50% or more, the story line was entertaining.
12670	 Negative:  - Repetitive and boring gameplay. - Low resolution textures. - Fewer gameplay features than Mafia 2. - Performances problems. - Dumb enemy AI. - Annoying cops. - 30 FPS lock on release (patched some days later).   Positive:  + Great soundtrack. + Interesting scenario. + Good weapon feeling.  My biggest gaming disappointment of 2016.
12671	I could wipe my â¥â¥â¥ with this game :(
12672	Good story, Terrible graphics and physics...
12673	The game is like a huge loop. All jobs have the same way of doing, over and over again. Buy it when 75% Discount only!!!!
12674	Review After 12 Hours  A game with loads of potential, squandered by lack of Mission creativity, and lack of overall variety in Mission types.  Pros - Soundtrack is absolutely amazing (Jimi Hendrix, Johnny Cash, CCR) - Story is great! 1960s crime syndicate/city takeover. So great - Driving is fun, especially on simulation mode - Graphics are okay. Not great, not bad, but just 'Okay'  Cons - Missions are repetitive as â¥â¥â¥â¥. Break up the racketeering joint. Kill guys. interrogate Boss. Hand over District. Repeat.  (I have put 12 hours into the game, and nothing else has happened besides this. No exaggeration. That's it) - A.I is absolutely terrible. Basic last gen stuff. - Pop in is drastically bad.  - 30FPS until patch (Strange they didn't just launch with 60FPS)  I would not recommend the game at full price. If you could get it at a sale price (60% off or more) I would say try it. Still repetitive as â¥â¥â¥â¥ though.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKioT-DpnyM 
12675	'sneak' up from behind. Slit throut. Repeat.  If you love Mafia 1 and 2. You will hate the game.
12676	If you have an older AMD/Intel processor, do not buy this game yet!   Does not even start on my machine: AMD Phenom X6 1090T R9 290 4GB 12GB of RAM  so when this and the 30FPS lock is fixed, i will write a new review, but for now, for god sake stay away!  UPDATE 1: The 30fps patch has released, and i have some news for you, i still didn't play a second of the game, so i don't care about performance updates!! i want to run mafia on my machine, cause it's no excuse the game does not support bla bla bla, it is the ONLY game out that has this problem!! And if the devs are so lazy to not fix this then DO NOT spend your well earned money on this piece of crap, buy Battlefeld 1 or something else.  UPDATE 2: 5.8 GB of an update, and no phenom fix...yes they focused on new clothes, rather than fixing what is broken, fixes are minor, but i can't tell what they fixed, i still cant run this exuse for a game!!
12677	'sneak' up from behind. Slit throut. Repeat.  If you love Mafia 1 and 2. You will hate the game.
12678	As a mafia 2 fan I feel like they just slab the name 'Mafia 3' on this one to attract old fan, this should just be a new IP, most of the attention to details that exist in Mafia 2 are all gone! Hell you can't even flush the toilet in the game now, you can do that and other small little detail in Mafia 2, which IMO makes the game feel alive and unique.
12679	 Negative:  - Repetitive and boring gameplay. - Low resolution textures. - Fewer gameplay features than Mafia 2. - Performances problems. - Dumb enemy AI. - Annoying cops. - 30 FPS lock on release (patched some days later).   Positive:  + Great soundtrack. + Interesting scenario. + Good weapon feeling.  My biggest gaming disappointment of 2016.
12680	I could wipe my â¥â¥â¥ with this game :(
12681	Poor port, 30 fps lock, bugs in the first minutes...  Refunded, if they fix this game maybe IÂ´ll give them another change but only in the next Steam sale, companies need to learn in some way...
12682	This game does not feel OK.   Do I think that you just play this game? YES. Why not?  It's not because some of us did not like the game that you wouldn't like it either. Give it a try and if you really don't like it. Just ask papa Gaben for a refund.   I only played one hour and watched the rest on YouTube. So here is MY opinion on the game. Disclaimer: My opinion might differ from your opinion.   Graphics: 5/10. (Not the best but who really cares? I'd rahter have a fun game then a good looking game. Mafia II is much better then this game but this game looks better.) Story: 2/10. (Just another boring revenge story. Nothing really suprised me. I could've guessed the ending without even playing it.)  Problems with this game: - Bad port - Boring world with nothing to do really.  - Boring story  This game is NOT worth the price. Play some other games untill this goes on sale.   I hope my 'opinion' was a little helpfull. But don't decide if you should buy this game based on opinions. If you have the money try it and if you don't really like it. Ask for a refund.   If you don't have the money. Don't buy this game. Lot's of more games out there that you will enjoy and maybe get it for less money.   Have a nice day.
12683	Stay away from this game. Frame rate is horrible, it is unoptimized, gameplay is wonky and inconsistant. The only redeming quality of this game is the story and the sad part is you need to suffer for hours just to get to the minor good parts. There are no traditional missions in the game, it relies too heavily on it's psudo-open-world tasks to have the player progress. These tasks are repeated over and over again in each town district of the game. The side missions are also the same open-world tasks. This was a serious disappointment.
12684	Over hyped piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. I wish the developers ruin for daring to release this â¥â¥â¥â¥.  At least â¥â¥â¥â¥ing fix the police AI and the enemy AI before you give us crap DLC or â¥â¥â¥â¥ race car modding / dress-up kits.  â¥â¥â¥â¥ HANGAR 13 and anyone who hyped this game on YOUTUBE.
12685	the game is just plain boring
12686	I just finished the game, and here are my throughts:  1, The story is interesting, and the cutscenes are just excellent; but they are too short and too far from one another. You better just go on youtube and watch the whole damn thing to save both money and time. 2. There are some interesting levels, but then again, they are too few in numbers and too far from one another. 3. They got the balls to include achievements that require two separeate playthroughs? As if one is not more than rnough. Also, no achievement for collecting all the magazines and posters? WTF? 4. Too many collectable TL-19 fuses. To be exact, 246 too many (yes, my OCD kicked-in a bit). What were they thinking about? 5. Graphics are pure garbage and game performance is just bad (I am rocking a GTX 1070+i7-6700 yet I cannot run 2K smooothly at 60FPS on low textures). Unless you have a controller, the inputs and UI elements are going to be terrible as well. 6. Gameplay is just repeatitive as hell; the AIs are dumb as well (I died only 9 times on hard difficulty). To be honest, I wouldn't even finish the game should it came out a few days later (cough cough Battlefield 1 cough cough).   Conclusion: Watch youtube and save both money and time. And please give those who pre-ordered the deluxe edition a moment of silence.
12687	This game does absolutely not match in anyway the screenshots. Its total trash.
12688	It's predecessor (released 2010) had working mirrors that reflected an image of your character, Mafia III doesn't.   Mafia III doesn't give you (graphically) what they showed us in all of the demos at e3, etc. The textures are horrible, lighting is horrible, world is boring and the game becomes very repititive.   Launcher also stays open in background which put me above 2 hours and stopped me from being able to refund ;)
12689	It pains me to leave a not recommend because the game is kind of fun. When missions glitch out though and makes it impossible to progress, I would say the game is broken. If things are patched up then I may change this review, but until my halted progress is fixed I cannot recommend this game at this time.
12690	Buggy,glitchy,ugly and runs like â¥â¥â¥â¥......this is what happens when you put more time,effort and money into making the cutscenes look great!! *edit* Would like to add that there are two things that keep me playing this game,the old American cars and the driving/drifting round corners feel good {at wildly fluctuating FPS though] I would also say the gunplay is good,BUT the dumbest AI I've ever seen kill the fun of that.  I just can't give this a positive review cause the port to PC and AI is so bad,giving it a positve would be like saying its ok to shaft PC players.
12691	DON'T BUY THIS CRAPY BETA, its 30FPS lock which makes it pretty much unplayable and although performance sucks â¥â¥â¥â¥ (30fps are not stable and drop down to 20 for me on medium settings with i5 4670k@4ghz and gtx770 2gb), furthermore Graphics are outdated af (not much of an improvement compared to Mafia2 which was 6 years ago)   
12692	I had to force myself to play through this mind numbing experience. Never do you feel absorbed into the story or atmosphere. The story doesn't really make sense, as it portrays you as a mob leader running drugs and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s and robin hood at the same time. The voice acting is really good, but the number of cut scenes and fragmented story are just ughhhhss. They rely heavily on the shock value of the racist elements of the story, but it gets stale quick. The news updates on the car radio were about the only thing entertaining for me, and mildly so. Not a fun game, not a dark game. Just another follow the recipe open world GTA clone with bad controls made for the console market with a PC port.
12693	Not for human
12694	I'm gonna start off with saying that this game had so much potential. Lincoln Clay is an absolute badass, and his voice actor suits his hard-boiled personality perfectly. The problem is that this game is plagued with so many issues that it makes it hard to enjoy the creative story and environment.  Let's start off with pros and then proceed to talk about the cons:  Pros:   -As previously stated, this game has a lot of potential to be game of the year. The main character, story, and setting are all top notch, but the execution is awful.  -Even though game runs with 30FPS cap, the 30 FPS was smooth for me. It's definitely playable and wasn't as distracting as I thought it would be since I'm used to playing games in 144 Hertz.  - Story is interesting, I'm enjoying what I'm seeing so far. The characters are nicely designed and voice acted, and most importantly are believable.  -Gameplay is solid. Not necessarily addicting or perfect, but solid. Most guns feel good to shoot, and Melee works well most of the time.  -Sadly the positive aspects of this game are few and far between, but one last thing I want to mention I enjoy is animations and cutscenes. The cutscenes are well acted and look graphically superb to the game. The animations are very brutal and feel good to execute.  Cons:  -Awful 21:9 support. I'm playign this game on an Acer Predator X34, and the image is definitely sub par to other 21:9 games I've played this year.  -Graphics make the game look like an HD PS2 game. It was obviously not properly supported on PC to allow player with powerful hardware to take advantage of it. It feels like a lazy console port, with absolutely no benefit of playing on PC other than the promise of a future patch for 60 FPS and unlimited frame rates. Character model faces are muddy and unclear, textures are muddy, field of view is awful, anti-aliasing has no advanced options like SSAO, MSAA, or even FXAA, just low, medium, high, textures don't even have a settign to control, meaning you're stuck with what look like console textures on a game by a huge Publisher in 2016. Overall graphic options and presentation are absolutely abysmal.  -No keyboard key remapping, meaning I had to use controller since KB&amp;M controls were wonky.  -Visual glitches such as green waves covering Lincoln's face in scenes with dark shadows.  -Game crashing to desktop issue that occured for me twice in one hour, unacceptable.  Conclusion:   Had the potential to be a stellar release, but dropped the ball big time. Rushed PC port with awful visuals, unnacceptable CTD issues, and no 60FPS support at launch.  4/10 - Absolutely below average, and sadly not one of the better games of this year.
12695	the game is broken is rubbish, only thing that works is the story
12696	At this point i 1hr+ into the game and i enjoy it.. but..... it's kinda washed out and the 30 fps is bad....  I dont think i will continue untill i can play it at stalbe 60fps..  My specs are.  I7 6700k Gtx 970 FTW+ 16gb ddr4 2133 mhz
12697	(Oct, 7th) I would wait for the post release update if I were you.  UPDATE (Oct, 8th) Nevermind the patch. It is here, it gives the game 60 frames per second but it won't save Mafia III from being one of the ugliest 'next' gen AAA titles available. Differences between low and high setting are barely visible. And adding insult to injury, this game is BORING!  B-O-R-I-N-G.  I played the same exact gameplay a milion times before! There's absolutely nothing new here and the mission structure plays a hell lot like Assassin's Creed Syndicate (do some missions in this area; unlock the boss of the area; kill the boss; the area is now yours. RINSE AND REPEAT FOREVER!!!) which is NOT good.  Developers promise to bring races, car customizations, costumes and whatnot available (mostly) for free very soon, but, at least for me, it just doesn't make sense to not make those available at launch.
12698	  Great potential but definitely not a game for 2016.  Besides 30 frames lock, the graphics of this game will shock you...i have impression to play a game in year 2000 I love 2K Company for NBA but Mafia 3 is worth 10 eu
12699	THIS GAME IS GARBAGE DONT BUY IT YOULL DO THE SAME THING OVER N OVER I WAS SO STOKED FOR IT AND ITS â¥â¥â¥â¥! GIVE ME MY 80$ BACK IM GOING HOME SCREW OFF I HATE U DEVOLPERS GO HOME.
12700	Lets begin, no widescreen support, random crashes, graphics worse than in mafia 2, just the sound is ok...
12701	Finished the game. Felt like a chore.  SPOILERS AHEAD:  The game is an open world with several districts wich all feel the same and you have to take them all. After you've taken two Districts you'll realize that you just have to do the same thing over and over again (go there, kill/interrogate that guy). Once you've killed/interrogated enough people in a district you can kill the districts boss.  I enjoyed the driving part of the game (on simulation mode) and the shooting is not bad. Music is also good and the city looks great.  Civilians are kinda dumb and policemen are out for you.  Game is super repetitive. I have to say I enjoyed the last mission and the KKK gathering one.  Would not recommend  
12702	This is my review of Generic Open World Game 6:  Technical Stuff: Can't turn off FXAA. Screen is blurred and messy. Randomly crashes (A LOT after the patch, struggling to play with frequent crashes). Bad performance. Glitchy lighting. Terrible muggy textures.  Bad keyboard and mouse controls.  Animations are good. Voice acting is also good.  Police will never attack anybody else other than you. Because 'they're in the mobs pocket', which is just an excuse to say 'we didn't wanna code that'.  As for the story, it really misses the charm of the first two games, which told a pretty serious story with finality and interesting characters. It felt like a story that was taking place within a real world. Mafia 3 seems to have gone away with that in order to accommodate their open world 'take over the districts' gameplay, making it into another generic open world game with padded content. The side characters seem over the top in a way and it just doesn't feel like a good mafia story. It's a shame, I think, because the Mafia games really are unique. I always enjoyed how you were a grunt in the mafia machine and you weren't this force to be reckoned with, with a cliche revenge story, you were just a guy trying to be somebody, and sometimes that meant doing the grunt work. It feels like it's trying to be as appealing a game as possible, instead of the unique games that Mafia 1 and 2 were.  I don't understand how people are saying the story is 'amazing'. It's not a bad story, but it's nothing special, just a overdone revenge plot. Every single plot point in the game is 'but how should we kill them all?'. One dimensional and uninteresting characters. What do we learn about Lincoln Clay throughout the entire game? Nothing really. He's good at killing and that's about it. There's no reprecussion to any of his actions, police don't come after you, the mafia doesn't respond to you in any meaningful way other than saying 'Wow he's disrupting us' in some cutscenes. Yawn.  Got bored after 6 hours, tried to power through to the end, decided it's not worth it.  See this video for more reasons why Mafia 2 is better:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixlszwKVVP0  Even if the technical problems are corrected, I still wouldn't recommend this game.
12703	Wow, wish a had read the reviews here before buying. I've had lost of crashes so far and I'm playing with all the latest drivers on a win10 computer. The game is impossible to play with the STEAM CONTROLLER, 2K games should be ashamed! I can not recommend this game in its current condition.
12704	Unfortunately a great disappointment and really a 'what could have been' type situation for this game. Not to mention yet another warning not to pre-order games especially on PC. From my small amount of play time (+ lots of youtube vids) the story looked quite solid and the cutscenes with people looked fantastic.   But for an open world game the exterior areas are just not up to scratch for a PC title in 2016. I hope that the textures, draw distance and other performance issues are improved soon and if so I may repurchase it in the future. They have a long way to go though when considering how it looks (compared to GTA V etc) and I could barely get 30 fps on high unlocked at 1440p with an i7-6700k, 32gb ram and 2x 970 GTX, which can run GTA V at 80-100 fps on max.
12705	locked 30fps !!!
12706	There are good games, there are bad games, and then you have garbage.   This game belongs to the third category. It is poorly optimized and glitchy at release, even after patches the bugs persist. Only people who are good at jokes (or those who are a joke themselves) would release a game that's not completed or fully tested - and have the nerve to charge people money for it.  My graphic card gets 45-55fps on games like GTA V on 4K resolution at maxed settings. This game is not even playable at high settings on 1080p. Unless you have a GTX Titan or above, don't bother trying to get a decent framerate out of this game.
12707	60h in and I can't continue playing because every single time I load and try to start one of the main missions it crashes. This game is filled with bugs, wich is a shame because I was really liking it.  EDIT: Ended up finding a way to fix the bug, but still can't fully recommend the game. The story is great, but there are so many bugs in it, you're better of waiting until the game is more stable.
12708	Great story. Which is about the only good thing I have left to say about this game.
12709	OM God! How can they freak it up so bad? This is Mafia man! Do you got any ideas how much does Mafia mean to us? I was dreaming last night that I played Mafia and enjoy it, After I woke up and actually played it? Yay, it was a dream for real
12710	My resolution is 2560x1080 = Lots of Problems. I can not recommend this game in its current condition.
12711	Extremely glitchy, horrible ai, and lazy physics... Generally a bad game
12712	To the guy who came up with the idea to have the game locked at 30 fps in 2016: Hope you get fired, burned alive and get r4p3d by 72 virgin camel d!(ks. People like you deserve a special place in hell.                   jk.
12713	30 FPS lock? NOPE, master race dont forget! crashed now after 2 hours of play, starting to regret to buy this game.
12714	I'm not even bothered about the 30fps cap (especially when considering a fix is in the works) but currently the game crashes as soon as I press start on the launcher.  Edit: Apparently the last update fixed the fps cap, although I don't personally know if it did because it still didn't make the game playable.
12715	Really bad game,when you get the main story objective its awesoem but as soon as you go out to the world its empty and you have to do mini missons all the time where you have to kill the same enemys over and over again....
12716	A solid 4/10 points, mostly beacuase all of the game-breaking bugs wich include but isnÂ´t limited to: Random crashes Some missions fails to start/load All sounds randomly stops working ( Atleast 3 times in my 9hrs of playtime)
12717	Mafia III showed promise leading from a great game that Mafia II was along with it's features including the original Mafia. It seems they have been quite lazy in developing this game although the graphics are good, not the best and the city can be visually good. All they had to do is combine Mafia and Mafia II into Mafia III along with it's features and customisation. The missions are incredibly repetitive and offer nothing new everytime, it's go here, interrogate, kill and steal over and over. I've read that FREE DLC is coming for customisation but it should have been in the full game already. Mafia III could have been another great Mafia game but without those little features and a more solid, enjoyable mission to play it just is another game that nobody will really look back on or replay it in a hurry.
12718	Mafia III have membership in an exclusive club, where few games belong. It is one of the worst console game ports I have ever played, where the menues, the graphics and the playability is so corrupted by this bad port that i struggle to even try to complete it.   I mean, the game doesn't even recognize mouse4 and mouse5-buttons when remapping controls.  As this price, I expect a lot more than y2k/hangar 13 has managed to scrape together. It's an insult to their customers.
12719	The storyline is great, and with a reshade installed the game looks good. But the game crashes alot and the memory allocation and optimization of the game is terrible. This is especially prevelant when you look at whats on display in the game. The game shouldn't be taxing our systems like this. I'm running a GTX 1080 and the game isn't stable. The gameplay is actually fun, but its hard to get into because the game crashes every so often. It's pretty bad, and since there hasn't been an update on PC to fix the glaring problems with the game, I can't recommend anyone spend a dime on this. Save your money for a game that is actually put together properly by the developer.
12720	Is it a bad game? No. But is it a Mafia game? Again no, all of the mafia game's mechanics have been scrapt leaving an empty shell that defines this game as just another GTA clone. PLZ fix all of those issues listed in these videos and fix the ammunition mechanics i play on hard and do not have any problem with ammunition and how the helldo i get smg ammunition from assault rifles?   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ1YMeY07xI   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixlszwKVVP0  (I am not the creator of these videos)  So overall i would recomend buying this game once all of the problems are fixed by hangar 13 or mod support fixes them. Finally pleas stop hating on 2K they only published the game they where not the ones to make it blame hanger 13. sorry for bad English.
12721	 The Good
12722	Its a good concept for the Mafia Series. However, with the obvious mist step with releasing this game at a 'peasants' 30fps; it was an omen to what was to come. The game looks a lot better after the patch. However, it is very buggy, and freezing in combat or emptying an entire clip into an enemy, only to have him kill you with one shot is not my idea of fun. It seems that a AAA game would be better equipped to handle the power of PC, but this game seems to have a difficult time and likes to crash, or glitch out while playing.   Additionally, it is kind of boring. I mean after the story line is done the game just becomes mundane. I played 8 hrs. and I'm done. It will now sit and collect 'dust' until I get around to deleting the game from my SSD.
12723	Alright, i don't write reviews mainly because a lot of issues with a title usually are explained by other reviews. However, this game is likely the most dissapointing, unrefined and downright offensive (Not due to the setting.) Game i have ever played.  For sake of simplicity, a simple pros and cons. (I see why 2k didn't release ANY real review copies, it would of been a flop before release.)  Pros: Story, although even that is a mess, Voice acting (The only thing i have no complaints with.) Cons: Everything else. No. Really.  Engine - Originally locked to 30FPS which made me avoid this title, but once i seen an update for 60 and unlimited FPS i decided i would bite the bullet due to my love of the Mafia Series. This isn't much of an issue but shows the developer knew they had a half-baked potato. Also of note is this game doesn't support SLI, and looks ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS on anything above 1980x1080 as the user interface is just about non existent at anything above it.  Also, there is a disgusting blur effect, even through removing motion blur in the options is covering EVERYTHING. and by everything i mean EVERYTHING. This game also has an abysmal Draw Distance and EVERYTHING and i do mean EVERYTHING 'Pops in' and 'Pops out.' CONSTANTLY.  Of other note also is that the game absolutely HATES you changing ANY of the default keymapping settings resulting in crashes, assigned keys not working.  Textures: This is a major offense, the facial textures in this game are actually very good, and some interior textures also look pretty good but EVERYTHING ELSE in the game looks like something out of 2008, it's not hard nor expensive nowadays to make proper textures. An especially good example of exactly how bad this is being: the skyboxes that look worse than some of the skyboxes from the Nintendo 64 / Playstation Era. It's the laziest excuse for a 'Sky' i have ever seen. Looks more like a zebra skin texture.  Lighting: This is probably the biggest visual blunder of the bunch,and all of the other blunders are just about deal breakers. It is INCREDIBLY buggy, it glitches CONSTANTLY FLICKERING and the shadows in this game are also horrendous, the time it takes shadows to actually update to the lighting system is delayed, the lighting itself also drowns out a LOT of color from the already very sub-par textures.   And during sunset or dawn the sun produces the most blinding, eye hurting form of light i have ever experienced in a game, and i've been gaming now for over 19 years. It's hard to explain exactly how bad it is through a video or image, it really doesn't become apparent how bad it is until you actually play it.  Physics: A little wonky, but i have to say is probably the only thing as far as gameplay that is satisfying. Although the game seems to add unrealistic, extra weight to whatever vehicle you drive. You can crash into an identicle model of car at the exact same speed an NPC is driving and the NPC's car will noticably be much more affected by physics.  Models: Very, very bad models. The hair of characters looks fake, almost plasticy. It'll make you physically say 'WTF' on multiple occasions as you go through the game. Cars and vehicles are also noticably a huge cut below the models in Mafia 2 from 2012, and the damage system for vehicles really is pitiful, the hood of a car can come off, the front and back can get a little dented but the superb glass models and physics from Mafia 2 are completely void, 'Scratches' in the vehicle damage system also seem to not exist. You can just about blow up your car and it looks barely any different if it was in pristine condition.  I remember in Mafia 2 just shooting a glass display out of a shop window and being impressed with the physics and breaking of glass. There isn't a single bit of astonishment here with Mafia 3. In any. Way. It looks miles behind GTA 5 or even indie titles of today. There's also a large lack of variety in enemy faces, textures and clothing.   Weapons: There's a huge lack of variance in weapons, i will say the shotguns are satisfying to use but, in the further sections of my breakdown, anything good about the weapons in this game are completely irrelevant because you WON'T HAVE TO USE THEM 99% OF THE TIME.  Cover system: Noticably again, a major cut below mafia 2's. While it retains all the features of mafia 2, it is noticably more clunky and unrefined. The only positive thing they did here was include 'Blind Fire' but really, you won't be using it much.  Vehicles: Noticably less variety of vehicles from Mafia 2, and this brings me to another shortcoming. There is little to no vehicle customization ( you can buy vehicle customizations from the arms dealer, however it doesn't have any charm, you don't drive into a car shop even although there are dozens scattered across the map and they don't have any visual impact, and very minimal gameplay impact.)  They have removed all of the realistic traffic laws and violations of Mafia 2 that gave the game a sense of being alive. Just don't hit pedestrians, put the pedal to the floor, don't hit cop cars and you will never have to barely deal with the police in any way. And gone is the need for fuel, or controlling speed, getting 'Hit and Run' violations for hitting vehicles.  The only positive is the vehicles don't entirely drive like boats and I DO like the visual representation of where to go when you select a waypoint on the map and this game has something i'de like to see in other open world games -- a WORKING REAR VIEW MIRROR. But, given the game as it is, these things i do like don't mean anything.  World Map: THERE IS NOTHING TO DO. NOTHING. Gone is the ability to stop anywhere to grab a sandwich, there aren't any extra activities, there's no rpg elements that reward you through skill progression to do things in the world. You will be going from point A to B following your mission tracker, or grabbing collectables and 'Fuses' (more on that in a minute.) and THAT IS THE WHOLE GAME.  They have also included a direct rip of Assassins Creed's 'Discovery' system, you need to 'Wiretap' at given positions which costs 3 'Fuses' that you find in the world which reveals within a certain radius the locations of ENEMIES (you can literally see them through the walls at ANY GIVEN TIME.) Collectibles (While nice, you can tell the licenses for the collectibles and soundtracks and album covers are where most of the budget of this game went.) and the aforementioned 'Fuses' which are nothing but a lame, uninspired way of tacking on HOURS of fetching them and calling it 'Gameplay.' Just to wiretap some more, just to get some more collectibles and fuses.  The only thing you can spend your money on, and i really mean the ONLY things you can spend your money on are car upgrades that don't matter, and weapons, as i will explain shortly that again, don't matter at all in the slightest.  Another gripe i have is just the general lifelessness of the world. It really is lifeless. With the only wildlife being GATORS.. Seriously...?  I'm running out of room for my review apparently. But the last, Story: This is a cashgrab story. There's no conclusion of what happens to joe, the pacing is STRAIGHT ACTION ALL THE TIME. You are given little actual meaningful backstory of lincoln, he might aswell be a gorilla with a knife in a cookie cutter revenge story. You meet vito along the way but even he is lacking character. The AI is so bad you can stealth kill for 13 hours straight with only needing to fire one clip of ammo. (weapons are unneeded) Also, i'm experiencing a gamebreaking bug where after Burke (third racket after 13 hrs of repetitive, exactly the same missions (story and optional missions feel exactly the same, empty and dull.) where no more story missions are popping up or available. So i'm essentially stuck with no way of continueing my playthrough.  In everyway this is a step backwards. SKIP, SKIP, SKIP, SKIP     
12724	I just refunded this game after playing 2 hours. It's very VERY poorly optimized and the graphics are terrible. I also received constant crashes while playing. Not sure what the developers were thinking here...
12725	This is my first no good game. This game is not finished. Do not waste your money to buy it. Do not waste your money to buy it. Do not waste your money to buy it. All the mission is just kill kill kill. Yes, it has a stealth mode, but there always put a lot of enemy in some place that you cannot avoid them in every mission. When you driving, you can see almost all the AI drivers are drunk. The stupid AI even cannot drive car along the street! They're just block all the street and makes traffic jam. The exprience is a kind of toture when you play a mission to trace a car. Because it's impossible to finish the mission since the stupid cars all along the street!  You can jump from the door side to other side without be noticed, even the enemy just stare on you. This game have too much bugs, much more beyond what I said.
12726	Can't play because game crashes to windows all the time. I have i5, GTX 970, 8 Gb RAM and W10 64bit.
12727	Music playing during the Launcher is really nice. Other than that, game won't start. Launcher crashes back to desktop. This is just really really sad. Still playing and loving Mafia 2 until this day and preordering Mafia 3 was an offer I could not refuse. But I should have just left the preorder store and only taken the Canoli.
12728	This game is absolutely abysmal on PC.
12729	Well I was really hoping and wishing strong for this game. Been the thing I've been really waiting for for about a month, and have keeped an interested eye on it since early this year. I can say, for me, this games has a hard time running, eihter it being low or high end graphics. I don't have an issue with 30 fps since I have used a ps4 and an xb1. But this isn't even a smooth 30fps, for me. It is very blurry and jittery. Hard to play really. This game needs some major graphic cleaning, what I mean is smooth gameplay. Hopefully this update planned for this weekend will help. For me again, it is hard to play at this moment. Will hopefully recomend in the future, but now, not recomended. ( PS, my system can run games ranging to fallout 4 to gta v to the division at 60 fps and full 1080 no problem. ) I really wish/ can't wait to recomend this game.
12730	had the game for 19 hours and still have not been able to play very dissapointing
12731	  I played it for a bit. everything seems somewhat fine. the game does constantly crash, but not constantly. Its locked at 30 fps. I wouldnt recommend getting it until the problems are fixed.
12732	Waited for the 60 FPS patch so I didn't burn my 2 hours and boy am I glad I made that decision. This port is awful. GTX 1080 at 1080p on the lowest settings and in the city I can barely stay afloat over 30 FPS. I will be refunding this until they fix these issues.
12733	THAT IS ABSOLUTLEY JOKE. After this update, nothing has changed, beacuse i still have drops from 40 to 20 fps. My config is : CPU - Intel Core i5 4690K 3,5GHz, GPU : Nvidia GeForce GTX750 Ti 2gb GDDR5 (i know, it's a quite old card, but anyway that game should works in minimum 45-50fps) and 8GB ram. I tried to change resolution and etc. but still doesn't work. Graphics in this game just looks like low port from consoles. Textures in low quality in medium settings... Guys .. Are you serious ? Actually, I'm feel very dissapointed.  
12734	Just requested my refund I wanted to like this but the graphical issues are just too bad, the washed out upscaled textures, the wierd sun/cloud flashing, the sunglare in general, the stuttering, the storyline is all over the place, jumping from one point in time to another, its completely disjointed, the cars handle like utter â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, the guns and combat are ok, but nothing special.  Even the 60FPS patch didn't make any difference, this game has serious issues, it doesnt just need polish (which it is sorely lacking) it needs to go back into development to be fixed, and then released later when its actually in a state to be played.
12735	WARNNING the entirety of the game play is ALL THE FLIP FLOPING THE SAME!.  It starts out so strong having good memories of older games then it hits a brick wall gooing at what the flipping flip speeds and just recycles the same sheit over and over. 4 hours in i think i realy hope this ends. NOPE 18 hours and still the same damn thing just in a new location mayeb if you get lucky its a new building layout.  Between the repetitive gameplay you get epic cutscenes with great story telling but that doesnt not make this game worth the asking price not by a flopping long shot   i havnet beaten it and i feel like i wasted money. I thought it was a no brainer to preorder... oops... i loved mafia 1 and 2 and the trailers and yes i know trailer rarely show real gameplay i just thought this was going to be a good choice to buy right away looked liek a good damn time.  Sadly i feel ripped off and cheated. and would like my money back... yeah i know i â¥â¥â¥â¥ed my self.   2/10 whata peice of â¥â¥â¥â¥- Dunkey-nmb  
12736	 The Good
12737	Its a good concept for the Mafia Series. However, with the obvious mist step with releasing this game at a 'peasants' 30fps; it was an omen to what was to come. The game looks a lot better after the patch. However, it is very buggy, and freezing in combat or emptying an entire clip into an enemy, only to have him kill you with one shot is not my idea of fun. It seems that a AAA game would be better equipped to handle the power of PC, but this game seems to have a difficult time and likes to crash, or glitch out while playing.   Additionally, it is kind of boring. I mean after the story line is done the game just becomes mundane. I played 8 hrs. and I'm done. It will now sit and collect 'dust' until I get around to deleting the game from my SSD.
12738	Alright, i don't write reviews mainly because a lot of issues with a title usually are explained by other reviews. However, this game is likely the most dissapointing, unrefined and downright offensive (Not due to the setting.) Game i have ever played.  For sake of simplicity, a simple pros and cons. (I see why 2k didn't release ANY real review copies, it would of been a flop before release.)  Pros: Story, although even that is a mess, Voice acting (The only thing i have no complaints with.) Cons: Everything else. No. Really.  Engine - Originally locked to 30FPS which made me avoid this title, but once i seen an update for 60 and unlimited FPS i decided i would bite the bullet due to my love of the Mafia Series. This isn't much of an issue but shows the developer knew they had a half-baked potato. Also of note is this game doesn't support SLI, and looks ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS on anything above 1980x1080 as the user interface is just about non existent at anything above it.  Also, there is a disgusting blur effect, even through removing motion blur in the options is covering EVERYTHING. and by everything i mean EVERYTHING. This game also has an abysmal Draw Distance and EVERYTHING and i do mean EVERYTHING 'Pops in' and 'Pops out.' CONSTANTLY.  Of other note also is that the game absolutely HATES you changing ANY of the default keymapping settings resulting in crashes, assigned keys not working.  Textures: This is a major offense, the facial textures in this game are actually very good, and some interior textures also look pretty good but EVERYTHING ELSE in the game looks like something out of 2008, it's not hard nor expensive nowadays to make proper textures. An especially good example of exactly how bad this is being: the skyboxes that look worse than some of the skyboxes from the Nintendo 64 / Playstation Era. It's the laziest excuse for a 'Sky' i have ever seen. Looks more like a zebra skin texture.  Lighting: This is probably the biggest visual blunder of the bunch,and all of the other blunders are just about deal breakers. It is INCREDIBLY buggy, it glitches CONSTANTLY FLICKERING and the shadows in this game are also horrendous, the time it takes shadows to actually update to the lighting system is delayed, the lighting itself also drowns out a LOT of color from the already very sub-par textures.   And during sunset or dawn the sun produces the most blinding, eye hurting form of light i have ever experienced in a game, and i've been gaming now for over 19 years. It's hard to explain exactly how bad it is through a video or image, it really doesn't become apparent how bad it is until you actually play it.  Physics: A little wonky, but i have to say is probably the only thing as far as gameplay that is satisfying. Although the game seems to add unrealistic, extra weight to whatever vehicle you drive. You can crash into an identicle model of car at the exact same speed an NPC is driving and the NPC's car will noticably be much more affected by physics.  Models: Very, very bad models. The hair of characters looks fake, almost plasticy. It'll make you physically say 'WTF' on multiple occasions as you go through the game. Cars and vehicles are also noticably a huge cut below the models in Mafia 2 from 2012, and the damage system for vehicles really is pitiful, the hood of a car can come off, the front and back can get a little dented but the superb glass models and physics from Mafia 2 are completely void, 'Scratches' in the vehicle damage system also seem to not exist. You can just about blow up your car and it looks barely any different if it was in pristine condition.  I remember in Mafia 2 just shooting a glass display out of a shop window and being impressed with the physics and breaking of glass. There isn't a single bit of astonishment here with Mafia 3. In any. Way. It looks miles behind GTA 5 or even indie titles of today. There's also a large lack of variety in enemy faces, textures and clothing.   Weapons: There's a huge lack of variance in weapons, i will say the shotguns are satisfying to use but, in the further sections of my breakdown, anything good about the weapons in this game are completely irrelevant because you WON'T HAVE TO USE THEM 99% OF THE TIME.  Cover system: Noticably again, a major cut below mafia 2's. While it retains all the features of mafia 2, it is noticably more clunky and unrefined. The only positive thing they did here was include 'Blind Fire' but really, you won't be using it much.  Vehicles: Noticably less variety of vehicles from Mafia 2, and this brings me to another shortcoming. There is little to no vehicle customization ( you can buy vehicle customizations from the arms dealer, however it doesn't have any charm, you don't drive into a car shop even although there are dozens scattered across the map and they don't have any visual impact, and very minimal gameplay impact.)  They have removed all of the realistic traffic laws and violations of Mafia 2 that gave the game a sense of being alive. Just don't hit pedestrians, put the pedal to the floor, don't hit cop cars and you will never have to barely deal with the police in any way. And gone is the need for fuel, or controlling speed, getting 'Hit and Run' violations for hitting vehicles.  The only positive is the vehicles don't entirely drive like boats and I DO like the visual representation of where to go when you select a waypoint on the map and this game has something i'de like to see in other open world games -- a WORKING REAR VIEW MIRROR. But, given the game as it is, these things i do like don't mean anything.  World Map: THERE IS NOTHING TO DO. NOTHING. Gone is the ability to stop anywhere to grab a sandwich, there aren't any extra activities, there's no rpg elements that reward you through skill progression to do things in the world. You will be going from point A to B following your mission tracker, or grabbing collectables and 'Fuses' (more on that in a minute.) and THAT IS THE WHOLE GAME.  They have also included a direct rip of Assassins Creed's 'Discovery' system, you need to 'Wiretap' at given positions which costs 3 'Fuses' that you find in the world which reveals within a certain radius the locations of ENEMIES (you can literally see them through the walls at ANY GIVEN TIME.) Collectibles (While nice, you can tell the licenses for the collectibles and soundtracks and album covers are where most of the budget of this game went.) and the aforementioned 'Fuses' which are nothing but a lame, uninspired way of tacking on HOURS of fetching them and calling it 'Gameplay.' Just to wiretap some more, just to get some more collectibles and fuses.  The only thing you can spend your money on, and i really mean the ONLY things you can spend your money on are car upgrades that don't matter, and weapons, as i will explain shortly that again, don't matter at all in the slightest.  Another gripe i have is just the general lifelessness of the world. It really is lifeless. With the only wildlife being GATORS.. Seriously...?  I'm running out of room for my review apparently. But the last, Story: This is a cashgrab story. There's no conclusion of what happens to joe, the pacing is STRAIGHT ACTION ALL THE TIME. You are given little actual meaningful backstory of lincoln, he might aswell be a gorilla with a knife in a cookie cutter revenge story. You meet vito along the way but even he is lacking character. The AI is so bad you can stealth kill for 13 hours straight with only needing to fire one clip of ammo. (weapons are unneeded) Also, i'm experiencing a gamebreaking bug where after Burke (third racket after 13 hrs of repetitive, exactly the same missions (story and optional missions feel exactly the same, empty and dull.) where no more story missions are popping up or available. So i'm essentially stuck with no way of continueing my playthrough.  In everyway this is a step backwards. SKIP, SKIP, SKIP, SKIP     
12739	I just refunded this game after playing 2 hours. It's very VERY poorly optimized and the graphics are terrible. I also received constant crashes while playing. Not sure what the developers were thinking here...
12740	This is my first no good game. This game is not finished. Do not waste your money to buy it. Do not waste your money to buy it. Do not waste your money to buy it. All the mission is just kill kill kill. Yes, it has a stealth mode, but there always put a lot of enemy in some place that you cannot avoid them in every mission. When you driving, you can see almost all the AI drivers are drunk. The stupid AI even cannot drive car along the street! They're just block all the street and makes traffic jam. The exprience is a kind of toture when you play a mission to trace a car. Because it's impossible to finish the mission since the stupid cars all along the street!  You can jump from the door side to other side without be noticed, even the enemy just stare on you. This game have too much bugs, much more beyond what I said.
12741	Can't play, it stutters too much.
12742	30 fps for PC what a joke
12743	Nothing to do besides following the linear story. You can't customize anything really.  The whole game feels more like an elaborate filmset than an actual living world.
12744	I wouldn't have pre-purchased this game if I knew it's limited to 30 FPS ! If I wanted 30 fps from a PC game I would have not build a gaming pc in the first place.  The game's price is nowhere near the low graphic detail it offers.   This is my review. Buy it is you want. I don't care.
12745	Massive disappointment.....let's hope for a patch. Even the graphics are far away from 2016. The atmosphere however, may safe the game . Wait for a deal to buy this game.
12746	Pre ordered the game and can't even play it.  Crashes everytime when I try to start it, no fix helped.  It's good to know that they earn millions on this game but can't even get the most fundamental things to work (60 FPS i.e.).  What has happend to this industry? Remember a few years ago when you bought a game, had the full content without any DLCs and it actually worked?  ffs fix your game Hangar 13 / 2K...
12747	I mean, I don't know, It just feels boring, I own serveral consoles so the FPS lock isn't an issue even thoe i'd love to use my 144hz monitor to the fullest in Mafia III.  The game is just boring, well, yes the story is pretty solid but the things that made Mafia II so good between the story missions is missing, no character customazation what so ever, you can't really change the visuals of your car, police is a joke, in Mafia II you had to change freaking clothes to get the cop of your â¥â¥â¥, now you can just drive away. The world feels just so empty, i've heard rumors of a 'Free DLC' which would include customization for both Cars and Characters, but I won't belive it 'till I see it.  I would say, wait, let 2K fix their mess-ups (which I really really hope, because they usually fix stuff) then buy the game if they made the game more Mafia like.  Right now I just feel that the game is not really Mafia, it's just a bad 1960's GTA style game.  Really disappointed actually.  -CHP
12748	Angry Blackman: The Game
12749	Can't play, it stutters too much.
12750	30 fps for PC what a joke
12751	Can't play because game crashes to windows all the time. I have i5, GTX 970, 8 Gb RAM and W10 64bit.
12752	Music playing during the Launcher is really nice. Other than that, game won't start. Launcher crashes back to desktop. This is just really really sad. Still playing and loving Mafia 2 until this day and preordering Mafia 3 was an offer I could not refuse. But I should have just left the preorder store and only taken the Canoli.
12753	This game is absolutely abysmal on PC.
12754	Well I was really hoping and wishing strong for this game. Been the thing I've been really waiting for for about a month, and have keeped an interested eye on it since early this year. I can say, for me, this games has a hard time running, eihter it being low or high end graphics. I don't have an issue with 30 fps since I have used a ps4 and an xb1.

( PS, my system can run games ranging to fallout 4 to gta v to the division at 60 fps and full 1080 no problem. ) I really wish/ can't wait to recomend this game.
12755	had the game for 19 hours and still have not been able to play very dissapointing
12756	Before I get into the review, let me say that I love the game, but what the devs did is unforgivable.  I'm not giving this game a positive review to show the devs I don't support these kinds of ports. It's sloppy and lazy. Let me go by naming a few:  -Capped 30FPS (of course I had to say it) -Really low quality textures  -Objects clip into eachother  -The view distance is tiny  -The environment in general seems blurry  -Floating bottles  -1080p is blatantly an upscaled 720p (which is the main cause of many of these problems)  -Stuttering framerate -When the game launches, it doesn't close the launcher, forcing me to go into task manager and close it because it plays music  This is unnacceptable. This shouldn't become the norm for Triple A PC Releases. This is abhorrent and ridiculous. Hangar 13, I know this is your first major game (I could be wrong), but that doesn't mean you can do this to your PC community. You know damn well that a huge amount of PC Players can run this game so much better than you're forcing the entire community to play it at. Fix it, and fix it quick. Once the patch comes out, I'll edit my review depending on what happens.  EDIT: Now that the game has been patched, the game runs better now, but it's noticably poorly optimized. Even with the low quality textures the game has, it only gets like 57 fps. It's ridiculous. Also, the only other thing they changed was the keymapping. There's still no ability to change graphical settings. You can still only change post processing. Still not recommending.  EDIT 2: After playing for over 10 hours, I think I have a rough idea of what this game is. I thought this was going to be a successor to Mafia 2, but looking back at things, Mafia 2 is eons better. This game is watered down with the same rinse and repeat missions. The main story missions are few and far between, since you have to gain control over an entire territory to unlock it. It's frustrating and makes this game burn out fast. This game should have been worked on longer. They should have added more main missions rather than the side missions you're forced to do.  EDIT 3: Well, I beat the game. Can't say I feel accomplished. Story was alright, but way too overrated. I have no interest in playing afterwards. I feel like I wasted my money and I'm never getting it back. Devs released another patch that fixes blurry upscaled resolution, but it did nothing. I'm done with this game, and I'm not buying another game from Hangar 13; they can kiss my â¥â¥â¥.
12757	Crashes every 10 minutes. Struggles to maintain 50FPS on low settings with a GTX 1080.   Don't waste your money.
12758	Until the bugs are fixed don't buy it.
12759	Boring and the same missions are recylced alot
12760	Since this has been repeated over 5,780 times. This game is AWFUL. Running it on a GTx 1080 at 2 resolution and I'm not getting over 40fps. Wtf is this? This is 2016, not 1999. I can't even get a refund since I bought this on an external site. Didn't even bother playing more than 1 hour. Worst game I have ever spent my hard earned cash on. DO NOT BUY
12761	The game itself could be great if it wasn't for some inexcusable flaws. For example my save games were destroyed three times now(and that is without me closing the game while it was saving). I am done with this game. Not worth it.
12762	the most boring reptitive triple A game...a downgrade from mafia 2
12763	 The Good
12764	Its a good concept for the Mafia Series. However, with the obvious mist step with releasing this game at a 'peasants' 30fps; it was an omen to what was to come. The game looks a lot better after the patch. However, it is very buggy, and freezing in combat or emptying an entire clip into an enemy, only to have him kill you with one shot is not my idea of fun. It seems that a AAA game would be better equipped to handle the power of PC, but this game seems to have a difficult time and likes to crash, or glitch out while playing.   Additionally, it is kind of boring. I mean after the story line is done the game just becomes mundane. I played 8 hrs. and I'm done. It will now sit and collect 'dust' until I get around to deleting the game from my SSD.
12765	Alright, i don't write reviews mainly because a lot of issues with a title usually are explained by other reviews. However, this game is likely the most dissapointing, unrefined and downright offensive (Not due to the setting.) Game i have ever played.  For sake of simplicity, a simple pros and cons.

This isn't much of an issue but shows the developer knew they had a half-baked potato. Also of note is this game doesn't support SLI, and looks ABSOLUTELY HORRENDOUS on anything above 1980x1080 as the user interface is just about non existent at anything above it.

( PS, my system can run games ranging to fallout 4 to gta v to the division at 60 fps and full 1080 no problem. ) I really wish/ can't wait to recomend this game.
12772	had the game for 19 hours and still have not been able to play very dissapointing
12773	Before I get into the review, let me say that I love the game, but what the devs did is unforgivable.  I'm not giving this game a positive review to show the devs I don't support these kinds of ports. It's sloppy and lazy. Let me go by naming a few:  -Capped 30FPS (of course I had to say it) -Really low quality textures  -Objects clip into eachother  -The view distance is tiny  -The environment in general seems blurry  -Floating bottles  -1080p is blatantly an upscaled 720p (which is the main cause of many of these problems)  -Stuttering framerate -When the game launches, it doesn't close the launcher, forcing me to go into task manager and close it because it plays music  This is unnacceptable. This shouldn't become the norm for Triple A PC Releases. This is abhorrent and ridiculous. Hangar 13, I know this is your first major game (I could be wrong), but that doesn't mean you can do this to your PC community. You know damn well that a huge amount of PC Players can run this game so much better than you're forcing the entire community to play it at. Fix it, and fix it quick. Once the patch comes out, I'll edit my review depending on what happens.  EDIT: Now that the game has been patched, the game runs better now, but it's noticably poorly optimized. Even with the low quality textures the game has, it only gets like 57 fps. It's ridiculous. Also, the only other thing they changed was the keymapping. There's still no ability to change graphical settings. You can still only change post processing. Still not recommending.  EDIT 2: After playing for over 10 hours, I think I have a rough idea of what this game is. I thought this was going to be a successor to Mafia 2, but looking back at things, Mafia 2 is eons better. This game is watered down with the same rinse and repeat missions. The main story missions are few and far between, since you have to gain control over an entire territory to unlock it. It's frustrating and makes this game burn out fast. This game should have been worked on longer. They should have added more main missions rather than the side missions you're forced to do.  EDIT 3: Well, I beat the game. Can't say I feel accomplished. Story was alright, but way too overrated. I have no interest in playing afterwards. I feel like I wasted my money and I'm never getting it back. Devs released another patch that fixes blurry upscaled resolution, but it did nothing. I'm done with this game, and I'm not buying another game from Hangar 13; they can kiss my â¥â¥â¥.
12774	A solid 4/10 points, mostly beacuase all of the game-breaking bugs wich include but isnÂ´t limited to: Random crashes Some missions fails to start/load All sounds randomly stops working ( Atleast 3 times in my 9hrs of playtime)
12775	Mafia III showed promise leading from a great game that Mafia II was along with it's features including the original Mafia. It seems they have been quite lazy in developing this game although the graphics are good, not the best and the city can be visually good. All they had to do is combine Mafia and Mafia II into Mafia III along with it's features and customisation. The missions are incredibly repetitive and offer nothing new everytime, it's go here, interrogate, kill and steal over and over. I've read that FREE DLC is coming for customisation but it should have been in the full game already. Mafia III could have been another great Mafia game but without those little features and a more solid, enjoyable mission to play it just is another game that nobody will really look back on or replay it in a hurry.
12776	Mafia III have membership in an exclusive club, where few games belong. It is one of the worst console game ports I have ever played, where the menues, the graphics and the playability is so corrupted by this bad port that i struggle to even try to complete it.   I mean, the game doesn't even recognize mouse4 and mouse5-buttons when remapping controls.  As this price, I expect a lot more than y2k/hangar 13 has managed to scrape together. It's an insult to their customers.
12777	Really bad game,when you get the main story objective its awesoem but as soon as you go out to the world its empty and you have to do mini missons all the time where you have to kill the same enemys over and over again....
12778	The game is just boring. There is nothing to do there.  Developers just tried to copy GTA but didn't manage that.  The city is boring. AI is dumb. The missions are the same! The game has quite a good start (2 hours) but then.....
12779	side missions are just the same smash that up, kill that guy, get information, kill the boss guy which was in the location off a guy you had to kill earlier with the guys in the same locations. also if you see a mass of enemys and are like huh ill clear that dont bother the second you leave its gonna just fill back up with people because there was a target in there that you didnt kill because you didnt have the side object highleted so â¥â¥â¥â¥ you story is alright but it just feels so repetive it just smash kill info kill over and over and why the â¥â¥â¥â¥ am i the one going out on runs when iam basicly the don off the group ??? should it be more oh hey getting a weed delivery send your guys out to go get it and give me my cut ? not hey boss getting a delivery and i cba sending my guys so you go do it and ill give you your cut ?? the combats fun but the second you get a silenced pistol its just to easy even on hard difficulty. location wise its nice and graphicly its pretty good its a shame it just all dulled down by this same 4 things over and over. for a game going for realism though why the hell does it take more shots to kill a slightly fatter guy even in the face it takes 2 or more and even more to kill the boss of a racket i put an entier clip of thompson ammo into a guy while he was trying to get the car started and he didnt even care he just drove off ?? and theres still plenty of texture bugs hell my car has even been floating a few times . basicly if you want a good story and its on sale for maybeeeeee Â£15-20 its kinda like a ubisoft game they would rather make a 20 hour game with 4 hours off amazing fun stuff than a 8 hour game thats just all amazing fun stuff.Also the police are a joke you can go 120mph down the wrong side off the road hit a car and they will be like meh whatever and move on they only do something if you hurt another cop or shoot anyone infront off them and can someone tell me when bushes started being made out of pure steel ?that are impenitrable
12780	So far I like the game but the 30 fps are too noticeable. Moving the view with mouse is not smooth because of low fps. Waiting for patch to see if it gets any better. If not I'm gonna ditch this game. My rig is more than enough to play this game at well over 60fps. That's what I paid for.
12781	-Repetitive gameplay. Basiclly, at every district, there is one capo/lieutenant and two underbosses. Kill them and proceed to next area. -Mediocre story -Characters have depth, but their story is delivered poorly  -Crashed mid story, and when i tried to relaunch the game, it keeps hanging at the launcher. -Locked at 30 fps  -For a AAA game, I expected the graphical options to be more varied. -Mediocre driving  -Good gun play.
12782	WOW no quality control whatsoever. Why even port it to PC if its going to be this bad. Well they got till Monday to fix this crap or its refund time. Its like 2k is purposely screwing this up for pc! WHY?  Edit: Patch was a fail just bad performance all the way around coming from a rig that I can play GTA 5 redux mod near max settings and never goes below 60 fps. Solid 60 fps with modded fallout 4 and many other games.     CPU Intel Core i7 4770K @ 4.20GHz watercooled   RAM 16.0GB DDR3 2100MHz (9-11-10-28)  Motherboard ASUS MAXIMUS VI HERO   Graphics 6gig NVIDIA GeForce GTX 980 Ti Gigabyte waterforce  Storage 232GB Samsung SSD 850 EVO 250GB
12783	Story is super great and really intriguing, but that doesnt make up for the fact that the game is suffering from massive performance issues. 30fps lock and upscaled 720p textures. 10/10 would not recomend until it gets patched.
12784	  I played it for a bit. everything seems somewhat fine. the game does constantly crash, but not constantly. Its locked at 30 fps. I wouldnt recommend getting it until the problems are fixed.
12785	Waited for the 60 FPS patch so I didn't burn my 2 hours and boy am I glad I made that decision. This port is awful. GTX 1080 at 1080p on the lowest settings and in the city I can barely stay afloat over 30 FPS. I will be refunding this until they fix these issues.
12786	THAT IS ABSOLUTLEY JOKE. After this update, nothing has changed, beacuse i still have drops from 40 to 20 fps. My config is : CPU - Intel Core i5 4690K 3,5GHz, GPU : Nvidia GeForce GTX750 Ti 2gb GDDR5 (i know, it's a quite old card, but anyway that game should works in minimum 45-50fps) and 8GB ram. I tried to change resolution and etc. but still doesn't work. Graphics in this game just looks like low port from consoles. Textures in low quality in medium settings... Guys .. Are you serious ? Actually, I'm feel very dissapointed.  
12787	Just requested my refund I wanted to like this but the graphical issues are just too bad, the washed out upscaled textures, the wierd sun/cloud flashing, the sunglare in general, the stuttering, the storyline is all over the place, jumping from one point in time to another, its completely disjointed, the cars handle like utter â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, the guns and combat are ok, but nothing special.  Even the 60FPS patch didn't make any difference, this game has serious issues, it doesnt just need polish (which it is sorely lacking) it needs to go back into development to be fixed, and then released later when its actually in a state to be played.
12788	fun game to play, but the missions seem redundent. same thing all the time. i cant see me playing this game much longer then a few weeks before im burnt out.
12789	The game is ok... Well let's start off with the positives...  Positives -   - Fun!  - Lincoln's facial expressions as well as the other characters are on point.  - THe music is 10/10 with great tracks like 'Fortunate Son' and 'Paint it Black'  - Some of the weather effects like the rain and so on so forth.  - The setting is great! The young african-american man back from four years in Vietnam in a late 60's environment in the south.  Cons -   - The game is extremely repetitive, you essentially go around the city doing the same missions whether it's killing a enforcer or taking out a racket it's the same thing over and over again.  - Lincoln is one-dimensional, he's like a psychopath with no real explanation for why he's killing everybody all that we know is that the mob betrayed him and now he's out for blood. Other then that there's nothing.  - The story repetitive and there's not much to it, it doens't feel like your playing a true Mafia game like the last one.  - The driving mechanics are just horrible they feel extremely arcadie.  After going thorugh all those reasons it's sadly safe to say that I would not recommend Mafia III it's not like Mafia II which was amazing, other then that it's just not as fun nor good. For now I wouldn;t really recommend buying it unless you want to experience the story which is ok...
12790	Dear 2K,  what exactly did you do to this game? I was really excited about Mafia 3 since the story of Mafia 2 left some questions open and was really fun to play. After installing the game and not having seen any gameplay oder having read any review, the first punch in my face was the graphics. Even GTA V on Xbox 360 looked significantly better than Mafia 3 on PC... Though I don't have the best rig I expected something else.  The story may be fine but the game is buggy af and thus not enjoyable. Brightness changing from cloudy winter day to sun burning down the earth to ashes and signs reflecting any lights which don't exist... Man that really cuts off the fun. People don't actually react on anything u do and if they do, themselves or objects they get in contact with glitch around like in paranormal activity. And one more thing, fckn cars and everything detailed just appears like 50 m before you get there which is one of the worst things ever to me.   DON'T BUY THIS until 2K has fixed this â¥â¥â¥â¥.
12791	The storyline is great, and with a reshade installed the game looks good. But the game crashes alot and the memory allocation and optimization of the game is terrible. This is especially prevelant when you look at whats on display in the game. The game shouldn't be taxing our systems like this. I'm running a GTX 1080 and the game isn't stable. The gameplay is actually fun, but its hard to get into because the game crashes every so often. It's pretty bad, and since there hasn't been an update on PC to fix the glaring problems with the game, I can't recommend anyone spend a dime on this. Save your money for a game that is actually put together properly by the developer.
12792	Piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game ..... Bugs bugs and bugs , story is better than good , but this game is full of bugns , and another â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ , i paid 40euro for this realy , it looks like a studnet project ....
12793	My reasons for giving this a thumbs down are as follows:  - Limited map, it's all a bit samey. - GTA 5 is better in every way. - Main character has less charisma than a potato. - Skirts the issues of the time but unfortunately:  1. Falls into white man bad, minority good syndrome.  2. Ignores or brushes aside important issues such as how veterans were treated after returning from vietnam. - Ridiculous amount of gameplay padding via collectibles.  Honestly, might as well just have played GTA 5 through again, would have enjoyed it more.
12794	I could make some huge, wordy review about the excessively repetetive and boring gameplay, so boring that I cannot bring myself to play any more than I have. I could â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and moan about the rather dumb story. I could complain about a lot of things.  However, I think all that really needs to be said is that this game is a disappointment to anyone that enjoyed the previous games, an okay game at best to newcomers, and that it is not really worth the price tag.
12795	Very disappointing.  Cliche, boring revenge story, artificial main character, a bland open world washed out by way too much post processing with no reason to explore it, and totally repetetive and generic gameplay.   
12796	negatives  Not as good as the first one (doesn't feel like open world). The driving and shooting feels unnatural, even though i turned off all the assitance.  Performance issues, despitethe fact that im using an 8gb GTX1070.  cannot skip cut scenes first time around, I dont wanna listen to a haitian drug dealer telling me about how his family was killed, if you lost your family you should probably kill your self and save me the fake french haitian accent. if you die, you might have to go through mroe cut scenes and loading screens jsut to click retry. The wallet safe system could have been simpler. i hate having to visit the same burned down house again and again just to be careful.  limited vehicules, feels like mafia 1 had 10 times more.  Pros:  better than MAFIA II well, goodgraphics is on every AAA game now adays, so whatever, its pretty yes. good story line in general, good performances from the main actors. good atmospher of post-vietnam war era. descent radia stations. alegators.  I just wanna say that im a big fun of the first one, replayed it twice or trice, but this one. i doubt ill even finish it. I feel that the creators should have stuch to their original style. like GTA series does. and thats why funs of GTA and Saint row fans seem to be very loyal. I in the other hand feel like each MAFIA was so different from the previous. and this time you are not even in the MAFIA, you re just killing them.   First MAFIA was like The godfather 1 for me in style and storytelling. secodn one was like: i dont know, good fellas. this one is like. Im playing Shaft or man on fire or something. completly different from the other two,. 
12797	This game is the biggest piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥ i've played in a long time.  1. The textures are â¥â¥â¥â¥ing horrendous - pop in and out, and the sky looks like a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing 64bit game. 2. The â¥â¥â¥â¥ing story missions are literally the same objective over and over again. The locations they're set in are bland as â¥â¥â¥â¥, and not memorable at all. 3. No customization what so ever 4. Car handling and physics are â¥â¥â¥â¥ 5. Side missions are terrible, and are the same thing over and over again, just like the main missions. 1/10 (piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ing worthless â¥â¥â¥â¥)
12798	Fun for 1 hour and then you realise that the game has absolutely no variation what so ever. You will spend hours and hours doing the exact, same, repetitive â¥â¥â¥â¥ over and over again. 9 districts in the city, talk to Donovan, get 2 people to talk to to start missions that make you interrogate npc, destroy crates and kill enforcers to draw out a 'boss'. After killing the 2 bosses in 1 district you move on to the next. The End.  3/10
12799	Basically a GTA game with a lot less stuff to do, but set in the 1968...  The game had a lot of potential, but was poorly executed. I would reccomend waiting for a Steam sale.  Pros: -60âs timeline is refreshing, not a period covered by many games. -Large map representing New Orleans  -Good soundtrack -Good storyline  Cons: -Verry buggy, has CTD issues (I'm running a i7 6700k / GTX 970) -Not much to do other than the main story, there are no side quest offered by NPC's  -Horrible enemy AI -Gunplay feels sluggish (the aim assist needs a serious overhaul). -Weather effects are by far the worst I have seen, and are poorly scripted. Rain looks horrible. -Bad textures... WTF is up with the sky??? -NPCâs are way too âcut and paste' -NPC dialogue is painfully repetitive, even worse than the 'arrow to the knee' in Skyrim. -Boring selection of weapons with no modifications.  -Your stuck with your vanilla character. No clothing or customization options.
12800	Meet Lincoln Clay a well established vietnam war vet. who cannot improve his aim or accuracy reload speed, health or stamina unless he makes enough money for some underboss and has to pay to do so. The police don't give a fudge if you're speeding, runing red lights, high velocity crashes into traffic or hitting pedestrian ands causing destruction of property, unless you kill someone or bump into the police but oddly when you tail someone theyre aware your every move even if you stop when its green. This game is one big giant fetch quest. Does not come close to mafia 2 massive disapointment. Wish I played mafia 2 again instead of buying this.
12801	Dont know what to say about this 'mafia' game , there is no mafia in this game , if you played mafia 2 and expect this to be a mafia game , you will be dissapointed
12802	Good old open world collectathon. Progression is repetative as all hell.
12803	Unfinished and unpolised and Your LITERALLY do the same missions, except some special missions like, kill a faction ruler, or crimeboss.
12804	meh bit samey after a while.
12805	replaymotivation == 0; repetive quests == MAXINT; story == MAXINT/2; compare to MGS V, Witcher III: no match. would not buy again.  go read all 'bad reviews' or youtube rants ... they're right. totally disappointed.
12806	In its current state, I cannot recommend this game. It's a horrendously optimized buggy game at the moment. Which is a shame because the game itself is actually very good. It is more of a GTA game than a Mafia game though, just set in the 60s with the Mafia being the main enemy.
12807	well i can honestly say i am extremely disapointed with mafia 3, after just completing the game. I absolutely loved mafia 2 the story and clothes shopping to tuning and upgrading cars. but mafia 3 lacks most of those things. i've experienced tons of bugs and glitches that still haven't been fixed since release. constantly lagging and major fps drops on a high end pc. extremely repetitive story and side missions. go there, kill him, go back, talk to that guy then go back to the same place to kill another guy.  i was so hyped for this game before release but seems like Hangar 13 ignored everything from mafia 2.  I do not recommend this game nor do i recommend paying the price for it.
12808	It is disappointing. It is nothing old mafias had, nothing. Dont get me wrong, the storyline is fun, it is a great story. Music is also incorporated very well into the game, its catchy and timely, sounds are surreal. Graphics are beautiful, shiny and expensive.  But it is nothing old mafias were, absolutely nothing. It is extremely repetitive, just duck, whistle and stealth kill. You can not die if you drive like idiot, no need to tank gas, can customize cars at all and there is no need actualy to customize them. Drive from place to place, shoot em up, boss, next objective.......yes and dont forget, duck, whistle, stealth kill. AI is on the verge of existance. Do not spend your money it is not good game at all. watch on youtube all the cinematics and play older mafias. I absolutely loved old mafias, the way it incorporates a player into the world there is a no game like it, you are all the time vulnerable and have to watch on details, plan you strike. In mafia 3, call help and shoot or duck, whistle,stealth kill.  Huge dissapointment on my behalf.
12809	Lot's of issues in the game. Road is up to his neck at times. Building where assassines are supposed to be is not really a building. Better fix these bugs!!
12810	Game is just bad.  Graphics are definitely not good.  Playing is extremely boring: once you finshed in a district, you have the exact same missions in another one. AI is the worst: hearing a whistle : 'I am sure there is something here!'. Killing the guy right in front of his friend, the other one doesn't move but then you whistle again: 'Hmmmm, strange, I must check it out...'.  Nice marketing campaign, they succeed to make a â¥â¥â¥â¥ looking good.
12811	My reasons for giving this a thumbs down are as follows:  - Limited map, it's all a bit samey. - GTA 5 is better in every way. - Main character has less charisma than a potato. - Skirts the issues of the time but unfortunately:  1. Falls into white man bad, minority good syndrome.  2. Ignores or brushes aside important issues such as how veterans were treated after returning from vietnam. - Ridiculous amount of gameplay padding via collectibles.  Honestly, might as well just have played GTA 5 through again, would have enjoyed it more.
12812	Angry Blackman: The Game
12813	Like many people have said, this game felt... akward.  There were NICE moments in the game, like hype for doing a big battle or mission to eliminate a certain person, or how they told the story in many ways, a documentary, released footage of a court case.  But the problem is, well there is a lot of em.  -It felt a bit rushed, a majority of the missions felt like a bad grind and it was more focused when you went to the swamps to only steal cargo of some kind.  -Chances are you and will stick with a certain weapon loadout type, very rarely using other weaponry other then to upgrade said set OR due to a very specific situation.  -I only died like... what 2 times after figuring out how to obliterate easily, one of those times being pinned in a corner due to cops. This was more easier to avoid with a full heal medical kit, and having at least 5 charges for em.  I could go on, but for some odd reason like I said, This game felt rushed somehow. Certain things that could of been in it were missing. If you want a story sure, get it. Game? Eeeeeh.
12814	Great game but just was very boring towards the end had high hopes because of Mafia 2 and it was quite a let down
12815	This game is the biggest piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥ i've played in a long time.  1. The textures are â¥â¥â¥â¥ing horrendous - pop in and out, and the sky looks like a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing 64bit game. 2.

Side missions are terrible, and are the same thing over and over again, just like the main missions. 1/10 (piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ing worthless â¥â¥â¥â¥)

12818	â¢ Low FPS â¢ Ever lower graphics â¢ Somehow blurry and glitchy â¢ The most â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up optimization ever  This game feels like a beta version or just some PS/XBOX â¥â¥â¥â¥ remastered on PC...  Can I refund this game?  NOMINATION: The worst game of 2016
12819	Meet Lincoln Clay a well established vietnam war vet. who cannot improve his aim or accuracy reload speed, health or stamina unless he makes enough money for some underboss and has to pay to do so. The police don't give a fudge if you're speeding, runing red lights, high velocity crashes into traffic or hitting pedestrian ands causing destruction of property, unless you kill someone or bump into the police but oddly when you tail someone theyre aware your every move even if you stop when its green.

12820	Good old open world collectathon. Progression is repetative as all hell.
12821	Unfinished and unpolised and Your LITERALLY do the same missions, except some special missions like, kill a faction ruler, or crimeboss.
12822	meh bit samey after a while.
12823	Massive let down. Shame :(
12824	Take Mafia 2. Remove almost 90% of the ability to interact with the world. Make the game look dark and gritty like Batman. Add 600 minutes of cutscenes. Reduce gameplay down to 10 minutes inbetween cutscenes. Add a really terrible shooting setup. Add crashes and bugs. Now wrap it up with terrible driving physics.  Boom, you just made Mafia 3.
12825	The story is great and I am pretty sure it can be tagged as the best storyline of the year. However, MAFIA III is not the sequel we all waited for. The 'missions' are killing the bad guy over and over again and the lacks of content are clearly visible.   I am really dissapointed and I can't believe how such a great game can turn into... garbage.
12826	By far the worst mafia game.  Looks really bad for a 2016 game, plays OK but almost everything besides the world and maybe the story needs work. Has lost alot of features from prevoius games and most missions are very repetetiv. Soundtrack however is a solid 10/10  15-20â¬ game at best. Would not recommend right now
12827	its pretty rough ,,just not enough to keep me playing it .i guess it plays fine ,not worth the 60 dollars for sure ..maybe 29.99 open world games are pretty tough to make . if your not rockstar or ubisoft ..not even worth attempting it ..leave the open world game making to the big dogs ....
12828	  Mafia 3 has been giving me problems for the last couple of days. I cant even get it to run. On the launcher I press start and the game freezes and crashes right after. I dont dont recommened it because I cant even get it to run and I have the minimum requirements
12829	It's just boring, the level on detail isn't good enough. Everything is repeating, you can drive 120 in town without police caring etc.. Play this game and try GTA 5 and you will realise the difference.
12830	So after logging 6 hours I couldn't bear to not share this anymore.   MAFIA III is the most boring game I experienced in a long time and I do not recommend it at all. It destroys one of the greatest legacies of games and it makes me mad. Terrible mad.  Facts: Even though the patch/update now provides 60 fps it is still not what you expect from a game engine nowadays. It is badly made. The interaction with your surrounding is way worse than MAFIA II. It got linear and easy and well - very boring.  Houses are all the same. And yes they really are. It doesn't matter what mission you do but after 3 hours you have done it already twice. Objects look the same and are even placed on the same spots. I could go on but it would just be a review of these many youtube videos out there in which you can see the sad devastating truth. Mafia III doesn't feel good and makes you wish the refund option would be available longer than it is right now.   Overall if you want to enjoy the MAFIA legacy be smart and download the old games. They are just better in everything. I regret paying for this game!  Update: It never got better. stay away and safe your money!
12831	Great game but just was very boring towards the end had high hopes because of Mafia 2 and it was quite a let down
12832	â¢ Low FPS â¢ Ever lower graphics â¢ Somehow blurry and glitchy â¢ The most â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up optimization ever  This game feels like a beta version or just some PS/XBOX â¥â¥â¥â¥ remastered on PC...  Can I refund this game?  NOMINATION: The worst game of 2016
12833	Like many people have said, this game felt... akward.  There were NICE moments in the game, like hype for doing a big battle or mission to eliminate a certain person, or how they told the story in many ways, a documentary, released footage of a court case.  But the problem is, well there is a lot of em.  -It felt a bit rushed, a majority of the missions felt like a bad grind and it was more focused when you went to the swamps to only steal cargo of some kind.  -Chances are you and will stick with a certain weapon loadout type, very rarely using other weaponry other then to upgrade said set OR due to a very specific situation.  -I only died like... what 2 times after figuring out how to obliterate easily, one of those times being pinned in a corner due to cops. This was more easier to avoid with a full heal medical kit, and having at least 5 charges for em.  I could go on, but for some odd reason like I said, This game felt rushed somehow. Certain things that could of been in it were missing. If you want a story sure, get it. Game? Eeeeeh.
12834	Not at full price. Game was fun for a while, niceish graphics, ran pretty decent on my computer. THen once you get into it, it's sooooo repetitive. It reminds me of Assassin's Creed, the first one.  I think that's what bothers me so much about this game, it's not the first in the series, it's the 3rd. It shouldn't have been this after 2 previous titles.
12835	When i played Mafia 2 it was a very very good game and when you hear that mafia 3 was coming out you can not wait then it comes out and your left feeling let down and robbed   this game could still get alot better maybe with DLC and that but really for a AA-Game it is not all that mission doing the samething again and again and i really wanted to love this game but i just can not shame on me and getting it with the season pass mafia 4 will never be got off the back of this gamne
12836	This is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ borring game. Don't buy it.
12837	I do not normally write reveiws but this game let me down so much I needed to share.   Bugs galore: Cars spin in circles, explode, drive randomly into you npc's randomly agro / deagro I can stealth kill someone directly in front of another enemy without him noticing me, but if I walk 50m away they agro.  the list goes on and on and on  Flat story line: No real reason to keep playing, the story is flat and is if anything more annoying than helpful I do not feel at all like I was playing a mafia game, there was little to any mob feeling outside of killing the hierarchy of one enemy.  Mafia 2 had a great story in which you climb the ranks into the mob this doesnt even come close  Horrible shooting / driving / enviornment The reason to play these open world games is driving and exploring the world.  So many seemingly flat hills I couldnt walk up bushes are immovable objects couldnt get out of water areas due to invisible walls for no reason would constantly randomly hit invisible barriers while driving near walls causing serious car crash shooting / combat is a complete joke... hide, pop up, headshot, repeat. I used a silenced pistol for the entire game and completely pwned everything even sniper shots across the map magnet hit heads every time with aim assist off.  Driving in grass made cars slow to a complete crawl, sometimes making it impossible to move the car on a mild slope.   TLDR: DONT BUY THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥ING GAME!!!
12838	Mafia 3 in my eyes fails to catch the 'mafia' atmosphere-mood.  Sure some of its gameplay is nice, and its called mafia 3 but no 'mafia' vipe :(  Its a one-man army run and gun, do rep. mission shooter, with decent story and for some that fine.  But the feel in Mafia 1 &amp; 2 was completly different, something this title sadly is missing.   And to follow it up it feels rushed even after patching.   (For Me)  Pros.::  - Decent Story so far, and decent open map (should be bigger). - Solid mechanics when shooting and covering. - The Lethal or none-lethal option is good, giving variation to kills. - Really Solid soundtrack. - Cutscreens are nice. - Overlaying old sceens and new one's like a old documentary is nice. - Driving Simulation Mode :)   _______   Cons.::  - Disappointing graphics even on Highest Settings. - NO sense of mafia atmosphere. - Very Horrible optimisation (even after patch). - Some Forgettable characters. - Repetitive missions. - AI : Not Really Any. - The Sky in this game is really ugly and pixelated. - day-night cycle terrible. - No Fast Travel (Even if i feel the map is small, getting rep. missions : get truck, deliver truck.. redo again same spot gets boring driving around then when game running like hell.) - No Real Save Option (random saves).   Small Things bugs or misses.::  - Driving at 90 into wall/house/shop and surviving.. seems legit :| - Disappearing textures, physics bugs. (Same on Low or High Settings). - Rob shop run away, watch shop from afar.. no one calls cops? / cops don't show (they did in mafia 2).  i5-4670k 4,2ghz GTX 1070 16 GB ddr3 2800mhz Samsung 840 pro 256gb SSD win10 64  On a good day i can play 15-25min at a time until i get Random Crash To Desktop (seems no fix yet, and no! turning off v-sync don't do it for me like some says).  And with no real save game option this becomes a real downer. And the constant bad fps / optimisation made me download Mafia 2 again.  SO :)  Sadly i can't recommend this title. In need of even more patching. If you really want to play this game find a REALLY good discount or make sure there's refund on it.  Alternative go get / play Mafia 2 think my laptop can even play that one on high :)
12839	Buy Asus PG348Q and get promotional Mafia III key. Can't play on full screen... Doesn't work even with 3930K@4.2GHz, 32GB RAM and EVGA 1070 FTW@1982MHz on playable FPS. (20 on 3440x1440) and on FHD nearly 60fps.   Bad port - almost reminds me from GTA IV.  I would like to play the game - If you would also - buy it from under 10â¬
12840	Every game has it's ups and downs and Mafia 3 is unfortunately one of them :(  The game itself is enjoyable to play but lacks content and due to that fact the gameplay itself becomes very repetitive , Yes they may be adding racing and more storylines dlc but will that change anything apart from giving the game more driving and shooting to do. So after 98 hrs of repetitive driving and shooting i give the game 5 out of 10 , i may increase if they improve the game more for the players. 
12841	Not at full price. Game was fun for a while, niceish graphics, ran pretty decent on my computer. THen once you get into it, it's sooooo repetitive. It reminds me of Assassin's Creed, the first one.  I think that's what bothers me so much about this game, it's not the first in the series, it's the 3rd.

12843	This is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ borring game. Don't buy it.
12844	Early access game for the price of a triple A title. Should have stayed in developement for at least one full year. Get it cheap or don't get it at all.
12845	Can someone help me this game stole 50 dollars and 22 hours of my life
12846	It is disappointing. It is nothing old mafias had, nothing. Dont get me wrong, the storyline is fun, it is a great story. Music is also incorporated very well into the game, its catchy and timely, sounds are surreal. Graphics are beautiful, shiny and expensive.  But it is nothing old mafias were, absolutely nothing. It is extremely repetitive, just duck, whistle and stealth kill. You can not die if you drive like idiot, no need to tank gas, can customize cars at all and there is no need actualy to customize them. Drive from place to place, shoot em up, boss, next objective.......yes and dont forget, duck, whistle, stealth kill. AI is on the verge of existance. Do not spend your money it is not good game at all. watch on youtube all the cinematics and play older mafias. I absolutely loved old mafias, the way it incorporates a player into the world there is a no game like it, you are all the time vulnerable and have to watch on details, plan you strike. In mafia 3, call help and shoot or duck, whistle,stealth kill.  Huge dissapointment on my behalf.
12847	well i can honestly say i am extremely disapointed with mafia 3, after just completing the game. I absolutely loved mafia 2 the story and clothes shopping to tuning and upgrading cars. but mafia 3 lacks most of those things. i've experienced tons of bugs and glitches that still haven't been fixed since release. constantly lagging and major fps drops on a high end pc. extremely repetitive story and side missions. go there, kill him, go back, talk to that guy then go back to the same place to kill another guy.  i was so hyped for this game before release but seems like Hangar 13 ignored everything from mafia 2.  I do not recommend this game nor do i recommend paying the price for it.
12848	Last time I saw this many bugs I had to go for an STD test.
12849	Pros: good atmosphere  story is good  Cons: 30fps Graphics are poor due to blur cover system is bad ALT to melee? WOW AI is buggy 2 CTD per hour  Overview: Steer clear till this ones on sale.
12850	A superficially pretty-game without much substance or variety.   The soundtrack is gorgeous. And some of the views of New Orleans are breath-taking. The entire concept of a post-Vietnam war era mob game with a black protagonist in that pre-civil rights era is attractive. But unfortunately, while the presentation, voice-acting and cut-scenes are generally very well-done, the characters and protagonists are as shallow and superficial as the game itself.   The main problem with the game is a persistently lack of variety. After the prologue, the entire game appears to be driving around from location to location taking out minions and named mini-bosses to lure out the district boss so you can take over their racket. It's a concept that's been done before (GTA 3, etc.). It's interesting initially and for a while but after a while you come to realise that the entire game seems to be just more of the same (without some of the other distractions that GTA has to offer).  As a 'shooter' it's fairly generic and not in a good way. The gun-fights and realism aren't particulatly stimulating or gripping. The stealth aspect of the game is interesting initially but lacks polish and variety. Combat in particular suffers from tepid AI - some of the stupidest AI I've seen in a long time.   Port-wise: after the patch (why was a patch even necessary?!!), 60fps and uncapped framerate and re-mapping of keys (with correct prompts) make the game more playable. On a machine that can run GTA 5 on close to ultra settings, the sluggish performance of Mafia 3 sugggests that optimization is not great.   Bugs-wise: have not yet run into any game-breaking bugs yet. some minor glitches but nothing too serious and generally the game works as it is intended to.   That's said, I do regret buying this game. It's not an awful game. But not a good one by any means. I cannot generally recommend this game even if it is on offer for the simple reason that it gets boring very quickly.
12851	Wait for Steam sale .  This game has a good base but it wasnt finished , it feels more like an Early release then a completed product. Overall id still give this game 6/10 even how it is now.  Within the next few weeks we should see Races , Car customization and outfits. currently there is nothing to do in this open world besides pick up posters and wiretap.  So far even at the current patch im seeing lots of issues  +Frame tearing  +Sun glare issues of vechicle paint +Skybox issues. + Vechicle sounds is a diffent issue. Sounds very animated and fake , almost tinny at times. +Missions are extremly repeatative !  +Police do not give tickets for speeding (no speed signs) nothing for going through a Red light or even for doung burnouts right in front of them LOL It lost most of the details from Mafia 2 funny enough.  Lacking Open World Content Cant get a drink at the bar , no snooker , no card games , no illegal gambiling , no clothing stores , no auto shop. Lots of things that could be in the open world that just isnt. im with you Why an Open World then? i dont know haha  basically dont buy untill its actually working
12852	2016 has been the year of disapointments., and Mafia 3 is the case and point. I have written three reviews for this game but just got to frustrated. CTD 7 times, wretched performance, some of the worst looking textures I have seen in years, the most graphical glitches I have ever seen(the sky can be pixelated at times though that is much better from launch, and the reflextions are broken), and cut scenes that are prerendered(so if it was night and raining it becomes day. I have had a NPC in a car in a cut scene totally change cars after the scene stoped. Seriously day time and sunny getting into a red soft top coupe and then outside of scene night, raining, and blue sedan) Simply this is not finished. Arkam Knight ran about the same at launch and that looked a lot better...   Personally I loved Mafia 1, like Mafia 2, but this is unfinished and I find myself trying to like it. Sure the story has an end and is pretty good(NOT great), but this is a game not a book. I run a 4790k/980ti/16gigs ddr3 ram @2400, this is the only game that currently crashes for me and to retain 60fps 90% of the time I have play @1080p on med/high with AA low or low @ 1440p and sweet Fx to enable SMAA because the AA seems to be FXAA x1(low) x2(med) and blurry(High). Theres promise here, but just to many issues right now. You incandecent pc gamers do not defend this bad port or we will get even more bad ports.   Enough ranting, lets get to the graphics. I will attempt not to rant. You play as a not very at all charismatic ex Nam vet Lincoln Clay, a guy out for revenge. Boring. A black guy out for revenge. Still Boring Hanger 13. Oh the cut scenes look great. The animations are all good, but once in game it feels like not that. The animations are stiff, the people look 2010ie and the trees all look the same. The variety here is bad. From Cars/Trucks/boats(no bikes again), to the people you see. You will see them alot. The same guy infront of you maybe the same guy four people away. I feel like naming them I see them so often. Hi Dave, Hi next Dave. You will see them that much at times. Then theres the animals. Ah, the animals. I saw a gator the size of a boat grab a man in the water and he's screaming 'NO! AHHH!!!'; while it does the death roll and has him under water. Good times. Well thats it. No, really that is the only animal and each gator is a copy and paste. I can't remember seeing birds. You can correct me but I think I saw a rat in a mission but have not seen one since. You will hear dogs at times, but there are no dogs to find,(they are in the first game) no cats, no deer, no frogs. Just gators and they all look the same and will just appear when an NPC is in the water or at random and each has the same animations. (The gators are ment to be a mechanic of gameplay to hide bodies, but cops/NPC are so dumb this is useless) The enviroments are empty and are barren of a living enviroment. Textures can look ok at times and other times I stop and just look in displeasure. They don't look finished. Textures can be low res and flat. Even the best ones are equal to Just Cause 3, not anything amazing but would be fine. The reflections look broken with a series of bugs. The cars can reflect fine at times and they attempt to show their period lacquer lead sled paint reflections, but it is the chrome that is the biggest offender. It looks wrong. Just wrong. It does not follow shadows or lighting logic and it is on every car since this is the 60s. The lighting can look good. Night is the most visually pleasing time of day as you don't notice the lack in detail and the lighting is good. Lights all give off a realistic illumination. The sun does not do this. It is overly bright and foggy haze plagues the daytime. It seems to be foggy because the view distances is very low. There are like four types of trees. The trees all look the same, and a cluster of trees is imposible to walk through. Still at times I forget about these issues because it can look good at times, but glitches and poor design are just as glaring as the blinding sun reflecting off the damp street.   Gameplay is another mix up. Seriously the control feels like Saints Row. Infact the whole game is like a serious saints row or Just Cause 3 with more issues, a serious story, and less stupid fun. Car handling is ok on simulation and I just don't flat out care about the arcade setting. It doesn't fit Mafia. In Mafia 1 the not realistic car setting was the automatic trans, what is this nonsense. I want my gears and clutch back! The handling is nothing like reality. Infact the driving is just missing character that big 60s cars have. Drive a 60s Polaris wagon with a 413 Wedgehemi and you will know what I mean.(Handling over 40mph-no, 60-0 breaking-maybe until the drums get heated then nope, speed-YES!) This is like the one thing each Mafia game did well. Sorry, see I'm trying not to rant, but they forgot the manual transmission for Fords sake! G.M. Chrysler would it have been so hard! Anyway. Gameplay is like the Godfather games, so uninspired but it works. The game does have a good selection on guns, but you will only want to use a few of them. The cars that are yours since there is no garage don't add much outside of your first car and two of the preorder cars. The cars were a huge part of the other two in the series. The game is a go here kill him, go there kill them. Pick a gang faction who are really annoying and sloppily done. Dont get me wrong it is fun at times, and is ok. But just ok. NPC are so bad Saints Row/ Just Cause level. All NPC that talk are in threes, and most are either walking or waiting. Where are they walking? To wait of course. Now go shoot 'enemy number xxx' and drive fast take chances. Shooting is compentent, yet feels unfinished. The lever action shotgun has no lever action animation... So you will wait after shooting thinking you are reloaded try to shoot. Don't hit anything with a car because the damage model is horrible as well as the damage taken just seems broken.   The world of Mafia 3 is empty and deviod of things to do, but the sound is good, voice acting is great and the music is alot of my favorites. From CCR, Hendrix to Roger Miller. Very good sound track and the highlight of the game.  The story is good albiet a bit heavy at times, but now that Im done I am starting to forget a bit of it. The problem is the game is so padded that its good place to take a nap.The story is hours between capturing zones so I stopped caring who I was trying to take down. Most of the times I forgot who I was killing because there is no investment in most of the mini bosses. I had no idea who I was killing half the time in Mafia 3, nor did I give a hoot. The story eneded the way I thought, even down to the choices. It is just such a forgetable game. Mafia 1 I have not beaten that game in over ten years but I remember most of the story/missions, Mafia 2 I remember a decent bit as well. I just finished this game I remember more from Mafia 2.(that world atleast had a lot of atmosphere and felt more living) Outside of the racism there is nothing different in Mafia 3. Though I am glad they didn't shy away from racism in the 60s, it does feel over done at times; only that is what they were banking on that as the hook'different.' I have no reason to return to the game outside of dlc. There is nothing to do, and since it runs like a fat kid in the woods with no shoes and look like a 360 port; the visuals don't make me want to return. The cut scenes are done well but the expierence is plagued with averageness inbetween.   I know what your thinking you charming pc users. Hey hot pants, do you recommend it. There is one glarring issue above all others and the reason I say DO NOT RECOMMEND;. It's not the chrome, the same missions all the time, or even the lifeless world. When you finish the game there is nothing to do and I mean nothing, but look at everything wrong with the game sadly.
12853	So, after spending $60 for this game I would say that it is not something that I wish I bought. The game itself was okay. Graphics and performance left something to be desired. Story line was fantastic and I loved the way they moved through it they way they did, no spoilers. However, the missions themselves were all repetative. Basically do the same thing over and over to get the district under your control and then go kill the boss. You can try to be stealthy to add some flare to the game but it does not give you anything if you do. So you may as well go in there guns blazing because you will most likely survive it. There was little to no customizing your character, Lincoln Clay. Mafia 2 at least offered something to the effect of changing your characters clothes, I assumed this would have been added upon. The only way you can get upgrades on your vehicles is through unlocking them by giving your liutenants rackets and upping their income. But there is no changing the color or wheels or plates or such in the like. Side missions pretty much did not exist in my opinion. There were missions that were 'optional' but they all played a part to the overal storyline. The only real side missions were the missions you run as favors for your guys but even then it is pretty much either go here and kill or go here and steal then bring back. Way to simple for that. I expected much more from the game for all the hype that was driven from the previews and I can safely say that I am disappointed. This game is really played for the story I would say. In the end you can chose how it ends essentially 1 of 3 ways. Which were all pretty satisfying actually. I will end it there. If you enjoyed the game, good on you. I would still recommend Mafia 2 over this.
12854	dont buy this it is currently broken on pc ive encountered random crashes and shadow glitches already, and i havent even really gotten started on the intro mission. and 30 fps yeah are you even kidding me this is atkham knight levels of bad. but for anyone from hangar 13 that is reading this you know already so my request wouold be a in game volume adjustment in the menues, and more settings to play with because right now its pretty pitaful. wait for a patch.
12855	This is my new review since the patch to remove the 30 fps cap. The game is fun but there are a heap of bugs still and low resolution textures. The game still crashes often (usually once or twice every hour). The fps cap has been removed but I'm only getting 40-60fps on average but it's usually around 40-50 at 1440p with a i7 3770k at 4.4ghz and an overclocked gtx 1070. It still sometimes drops to 30fps. The game is probably too easy as the AI are just really stupid and walk towards you after you kill one of them. The missions are quite repetitive as well. The cut scenes are good and the soundtrack is awesome. It's just a bad console port and for that reason I would not reccomend buying it. Hopefully the issues will be fixed because it has the potential to be a decent game.
12856	Game is very very buggy and gets very repetivative. Fun at first then just gets frucstating esp with all the crashes. Love mafia 1 and 2 i did like how they kind of tied mafia 2 into the game. But just didnt feel the same.
12857	It runs like my grandma nice and slow and looks like its about to die.
12858	Will agree to most 'not recommended' reviews. Story is lacking and game is very repetitive. Can't complain on graphics or bugs - did not encounter any exept for single crash at first hour of play. However it was strange when after 2 days playing third day found remapped control buttons, most likely by patch, without informing, possibility to go back, etc. so had to learn controls anew. It's worh a try if you find it on sale later at about 20EUR or less, but not at it's current price.
12859	Payed 46 Euros for the Digital Deluxe Edition of this game, still feels like I payed about 20 Euros too much. The graphics look more like 2014 than 2016, the gameplay is very repetetive, there are still many bugs left in the game that are annoying and require you to restart in order to continue playing and there are far too many cutscenes.  All in all this is not a worthy sequel to Mafia II, the ONLY good thing about this game is the Soundtrack.
12860	Graphics are the same on MAX and LOW, check this comparison video below.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtjfXZnNCds   Even with a GTX 1080 at 1920x1080P the game hits just over 60fps!
12861	Graphics are not even close to what they show in the trailers. Apparently it's locked at 30 fps and it doesn't even give me an option to tinker with the refresh rate so I don't even know if it's playing in 144hz. I have a $3000 rig and the game randomly just crashed for no reason. The story is really cliche and boring. I have everything in maxed settings and it still looks like a game on the PS3. I'm really not impressed and this game definitely isn't worth $60. The cutscenes are way too long, the melee sequences are extremely repetitive, and even on the hardest difficulty the game is easy as â¥â¥â¥â¥. Stealthing seems to just be a waste of time when you can wipe out the entire floor with a machine gun in a millisecond. I wasn't expecting a GTA 5 but god damn this game isn't worth $60. I feel like they focused too hard on the cinematics/storyline that they completely forgot they were making a video game and not a movie. It feels like L.A. Noire all over again. I give it a solid 2/10
12862	30fps, stay away ! This game feels horrible, looking around feels like you will die soon, motion blur everywhere even when turned off. Horrible port, wait for patch impressions, never preorder games from developer again
12863	I was excited for this game. I loved the first two, replayed Mafia 2 a few times, when they announced the third one, I was heavily excited. I was skeptical of course, a brand new studio working on this, despite drawing established people from other studios was still a tough pill to swallow, but I followed the game. The amount of pre-release videos drew me in, normally there was never that much pre-release gameplay shown so I figured the game would be alright. Boy was I wrong   It's obvious from the moment you enter the menus that this is a console port. I was expecting this but what I wasn't expecting was the general lack of care and polish put into the PC version. Options menu is pretty barren with very little options, not even a texture quality selection. Audio options are standard but not a big issue. Controls are where I have an issue. Rebinding is not great, and is one area where it's apparent it's a substandard port. A lot of pc players have mice that have more buttons and yet the game doesn't recognize these, can't rebind anything to them. Can't rebind any actions to clicking the mouse button either. You can always tell if a developer put effort into the pc port by the options menu and it is heavily apparent, they did not.  Now, onto the game. First off, when you change your resolution, it uses upscaling, instead of putting in the effort to make proper options, they went the lazy route. Texture quality is crap and they intentionally hide this via blur effects.Graphics are crap, even on what they consider max settings, changing graphics options does nothing, fairly impressive PCs are struggling to hit 30fps, frakking 30!! That shouldn't happen on a game that looks this bad.  Now the sad part is, this game could be good. The gunplay is satisfying, driving can be fun, and the story is really damn good. But, I don't know whether this was developer laziness or whether the publisher imposed deadlines on them that required corners cut, all I know is that the first game out of Hanger 13 is not great at this point in time.
12864	EVERY. SINGLE. MISSION. IS. THE. SAME. MISSION. IN. A. DIFFERENT. ENVIROMENT!  Oh and the world is so big the driving gets kinda boring, unless you have a fast car.
12865	With this 60 fps patch they released, I am getting 22 fps in the city on low and high. My pc is better than the reccomended specs (check my profile). So they just rushed out a patch without really testing it at all... I haven't been able to play for 5 minutes...
12866	Way to many Frame Drops for me I have to refund it and take my money to xbox one instead atleast i know the games frames won't drop as much there. Great game though wish I could play it right now but the frame drops kill the immersion.
12867	MOTION BLUR SIMULATOR 11/10 WOULD PUKE AGAIN  - 30 FPS Locked at launch - No reflection in the mirror (we're in 2016 remember?) - 2007 Textures - No 21:9 ratio support - Can't change graphics ingame 
12868	AT LAUNCH: - The game is locked to 30fps - Its graphics are pretty terrible compared to other games that I can run on my PC at a solid 60fps. - Key rebinding rebinds the key but doesn't allow you to use the new bind. (I accidentally unbound shoot, so I binded it to Mouse1 again but now I cannot shoot. Which is kinda awful. Also rebound M to map, and I'm now stuck in the Tool Tips thing that you get about maps right after you get Lincolns car. This is why I only have 30 mins playtime.) - No binding of controls to extra mouse buttons such as M4, M5 (side buttons) and no binding availiable for side scrolling buttons either. This is quite frustrating as I do bind almost all of my mouse buttons in most of my games.  VERDICT: - Don't buy it now, it's a broken piece of crap. - Refund it if you have bought it. - (Re)Buy when the FPS cap is fixed and integral parts of the game (such as keybinding) actually work. - The ability to not be able to bind anything to the same key makes the controls for the game a bit clunky but definately not unplayable.
12869	I love the mafia games on pc. The first one was fantastic for pc and even had steering wheel support with force feedback. Then came mafia 2 and it was great, but they got rid of wheel support and seemed like it was made for consoles so they could get more sales. That's fine right? as long as the game is playable and the controls are good, I'm happy with that. Then Mafia 3 is out and I try it going in and I've been waiting long for this being a fan of the series. The game starts and the framerate is very slow, even running on a gtx 1070. I find out that the game is capped at 30hz. â¥â¥â¥â¥ing ridiculous. Why would they do that, it looks like the game is running on the hardware of an N64. I try playing the game nontheless and I am driving through town. I'm trying to figure out how to use the car horn so I look in the control settings and it shows the map of controls for an xbox controler. This game is not ready for PC. It's a cheap console port. Unless you want to play with an xbox controller and tollerate a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ framerate then go ahead and purchase this game and you'll be happy. Otherwise wait until they get their â¥â¥â¥â¥ together and realize the potential of the pc gaming market.
12870	This game is full of bugs... Not going far through it already had to restart a mission because some objects are flying around.
12871	I do not normally write reveiws but this game let me down so much I needed to share.   Bugs galore: Cars spin in circles, explode, drive randomly into you npc's randomly agro / deagro I can stealth kill someone directly in front of another enemy without him noticing me, but if I walk 50m away they agro.  the list goes on and on and on  Flat story line: No real reason to keep playing, the story is flat and is if anything more annoying than helpful I do not feel at all like I was playing a mafia game, there was little to any mob feeling outside of killing the hierarchy of one enemy.  Mafia 2 had a great story in which you climb the ranks into the mob this doesnt even come close  Horrible shooting / driving / enviornment The reason to play these open world games is driving and exploring the world.  So many seemingly flat hills I couldnt walk up bushes are immovable objects couldnt get out of water areas due to invisible walls for no reason would constantly randomly hit invisible barriers while driving near walls causing serious car crash shooting / combat is a complete joke... hide, pop up, headshot, repeat. I used a silenced pistol for the entire game and completely pwned everything even sniper shots across the map magnet hit heads every time with aim assist off.  Driving in grass made cars slow to a complete crawl, sometimes making it impossible to move the car on a mild slope.   TLDR: DONT BUY THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥ING GAME!!!
12872	Its a good game. you can have allot off fun playing it the first 10 hours but then its becomes boring. AND THE PRICE !!! they ask too much for what you get!  
12873	Game still crashing and has performance issues, even after the recent 1.2GB patch.  I don't have a weak computer(i7, R9 390, 32GB's of RAM, game is on a SSD).  I got this game for $30 from a pricing-error on Humble Bundle, but if I can't even play the game for more than 30 minutes without it crashing, then it isn't even worth $5.  Game has good gunplay and story though, hopefully 2K/Hangar 13 fixes these issues.
12874	They dropped the ball...
12875	ATTENTION HANGER 13!!!! Over all this sucks. SUPER dissapointed.  I would NOT buy this game yet!!! Its filled with terrible terrible optimization errors. Im playing on a GTX 1080! yeah... i didnt expect my 800$ graphics card to not be able to play this like I imagend. The cut scenes are extremely miss leading and thats what i thought i could have with my $1800 rig. WHY!? why does every area have a layer of haze over the screen?. I thought my tv was broken. It has minimal tweaks not allowing to select HBAO+ or SSAO or MSAAx4 or A DISABLE BLOOM feautre you cant add debris effects or interact with anything except doors and cars and people even turning on a light switch would be nice or grabbing a beer from the fridge or sinks! why is there no interaction. The reflections are crap from mirrors to metal and the skybox is terrible! it all looks like â¥â¥â¥â¥. for a 2016 game... COME ON!!!! seriusly check out Mafia 2 and its ahead of this game it even looks better! AMAZING cut scenes but thats not why i baught the game
12876	I feel the adverts for this game was very misleading.   PROS-  SOUNDTRACK  CONS- EVERYTHING BUT THE SOUNDTRACK.
12877	why cant you just fix these issuse your meant to be profesianals so why can i still not get the game to work it doesnt even open i have reinstalled it twice now but it just crashes
12878	Sucks at everything a game can suck at
12879	locked to 30 FPS, textures are a blurry mess.
12880	30 fps is terrible, would not recommend to anyone until it is fixed. Save your money.
12881	I was excited for this game. I loved the first two, replayed Mafia 2 a few times, when they announced the third one, I was heavily excited. I was skeptical of course, a brand new studio working on this, despite drawing established people from other studios was still a tough pill to swallow, but I followed the game. The amount of pre-release videos drew me in, normally there was never that much pre-release gameplay shown so I figured the game would be alright. Boy was I wrong   It's obvious from the moment you enter the menus that this is a console port. I was expecting this but what I wasn't expecting was the general lack of care and polish put into the PC version. Options menu is pretty barren with very little options, not even a texture quality selection. Audio options are standard but not a big issue. Controls are where I have an issue. Rebinding is not great, and is one area where it's apparent it's a substandard port. A lot of pc players have mice that have more buttons and yet the game doesn't recognize these, can't rebind anything to them. Can't rebind any actions to clicking the mouse button either. You can always tell if a developer put effort into the pc port by the options menu and it is heavily apparent, they did not.  Now, onto the game. First off, when you change your resolution, it uses upscaling, instead of putting in the effort to make proper options, they went the lazy route. Texture quality is crap and they intentionally hide this via blur effects.Graphics are crap, even on what they consider max settings, changing graphics options does nothing, fairly impressive PCs are struggling to hit 30fps, frakking 30!! That shouldn't happen on a game that looks this bad.  Now the sad part is, this game could be good. The gunplay is satisfying, driving can be fun, and the story is really damn good. But, I don't know whether this was developer laziness or whether the publisher imposed deadlines on them that required corners cut, all I know is that the first game out of Hanger 13 is not great at this point in time.
12882	With this 60 fps patch they released, I am getting 22 fps in the city on low and high. My pc is better than the reccomended specs (check my profile). So they just rushed out a patch without really testing it at all... I haven't been able to play for 5 minutes...
12883	Graphics are the same on MAX and LOW, check this comparison video below.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtjfXZnNCds   Even with a GTX 1080 at 1920x1080P the game hits just over 60fps!
12884	Graphics are not even close to what they show in the trailers. Apparently it's locked at 30 fps and it doesn't even give me an option to tinker with the refresh rate so I don't even know if it's playing in 144hz. I have a $3000 rig and the game randomly just crashed for no reason. The story is really cliche and boring. I have everything in maxed settings and it still looks like a game on the PS3. I'm really not impressed and this game definitely isn't worth $60. The cutscenes are way too long, the melee sequences are extremely repetitive, and even on the hardest difficulty the game is easy as â¥â¥â¥â¥. Stealthing seems to just be a waste of time when you can wipe out the entire floor with a machine gun in a millisecond. I wasn't expecting a GTA 5 but god damn this game isn't worth $60. I feel like they focused too hard on the cinematics/storyline that they completely forgot they were making a video game and not a movie. It feels like L.A. Noire all over again. I give it a solid 2/10
12885	30fps, stay away ! This game feels horrible, looking around feels like you will die soon, motion blur everywhere even when turned off. Horrible port, wait for patch impressions, never preorder games from developer again
12886	EVERY. SINGLE. MISSION. IS. THE. SAME. MISSION. IN. A. DIFFERENT. ENVIROMENT!  Oh and the world is so big the driving gets kinda boring, unless you have a fast car.
12887	MOTION BLUR SIMULATOR 11/10 WOULD PUKE AGAIN  - 30 FPS Locked at launch - No reflection in the mirror (we're in 2016 remember?) - 2007 Textures - No 21:9 ratio support - Can't change graphics ingame 
12888	AT LAUNCH: - The game is locked to 30fps - Its graphics are pretty terrible compared to other games that I can run on my PC at a solid 60fps. - Key rebinding rebinds the key but doesn't allow you to use the new bind. (I accidentally unbound shoot, so I binded it to Mouse1 again but now I cannot shoot. Which is kinda awful. Also rebound M to map, and I'm now stuck in the Tool Tips thing that you get about maps right after you get Lincolns car. This is why I only have 30 mins playtime.) - No binding of controls to extra mouse buttons such as M4, M5 (side buttons) and no binding availiable for side scrolling buttons either. This is quite frustrating as I do bind almost all of my mouse buttons in most of my games.  VERDICT: - Don't buy it now, it's a broken piece of crap. - Refund it if you have bought it. - (Re)Buy when the FPS cap is fixed and integral parts of the game (such as keybinding) actually work. - The ability to not be able to bind anything to the same key makes the controls for the game a bit clunky but definately not unplayable.

Otherwise wait until they get their â¥â¥â¥â¥ together and realize the potential of the pc gaming market.
12890	Game doesn't start after 20+ tries. It instantly crashes. So did i pay 70 Euro for a crash and repeat launcher or what? Also the morons making this game have apperantly locked it at 30FPS wich makes me wonder if they are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ or their equipment for making games are from the 90's.
12891	So, normally I don't harp on graphics but even at 4k this game looks bad, the animations in particular are total rubbish. The settings revert themselves after starting the game from the launch pad, forcing you to reset them in the game.  The controls are insane, who in their right mind thought it was a good idea to make the page down key the weapon quick swap key, are you kidding me? Sure, you can easily remap the keys, but it shows that they overlooked the PC version/wanted you to use a controller to play.   Maybe the patch they are releasing will fix some of the small issues, but right now the game feels unfinished, and I'm not sure I want to wait for it to release to see if I still want a refund.  It is no wonder 2k didn't release any copies of this for review.   TL:DR Hold off for now, it has issues.
12892	Damn, so disappointing about this game. This is nowhere near Mafia or Mafia 2. This is simply just â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ spinoff. Ok, there is nice cutscenes, but graphics itself isnt that good looking. I actually reinstalled Mafia 2 and damn, that still looks awesome!   Conns:  - Guns feel like bbguns - Cars damage physics are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ - Police are like in GTA. Always tries to kill you. - Lincoln is clumsy af. Cannot jump or climb up over even a small step. - After couple of hour game play game already started to repeat it self. Kinda reminds me about old 'The Godfather' -game  All summed up, this is really dissappointing game. Wish 2K Czeck would have done this game instead this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Hangar 13.
12893	This is the reason I'm not buying games anymore. Piracy isn't cool but neither is feeling ripped off for a game you are super hyped about that turns out an obnixious thrown together buggy mess. RIP PC gaming if they continue to do junk console ports.
12894	Way to many Frame Drops for me I have to refund it and take my money to xbox one instead atleast i know the games frames won't drop as much there. Great game though wish I could play it right now but the frame drops kill the immersion.
12895	Well, first of all 2K did a fab job of hyping this game, most properly to get their cash back asap, as they knew it was rushed and flawed, i see speed bouts flying past me and i havent had a drink, honest officer!  After a few hours i got the hang of it, controls are crap for PC so i went to the xbox controller, after 10 hours, just 10 HOURS! i was bored sensless, sad as i pre purchased the game, on all the hype, as i said on 2K Utube, never will i ever pre purchase a game ever again. EVER, thanks to 2K.  Now im up to 23 hours+ i just cant be bothered to play anymore, i start the game and once loaded, i quit and its just be bothered to do the same thing over and over again, another rinse and repeat title.  I do wheelspins and donuts in front of the cops, they look and walk offm so i chuck nades at the cops, they chase me, i hide, they leave i do it all again for some action, open world seems dormant, people walk around doing, well nothing? i plough through pedestrians on the pavement, in my shiney car, no damage so i do more and rack up the murder total, I get out shoot them, just because im so bored, so its anther Â£40-Â£50 down the drain.  Shame really, the hype was awesome, shame the game wasnt.
12896	Enough is enough! This game is unplayable. Crashes every 5-10 minutes now and no patch in sight! Also is lacks proper 21:9 support and don't get me started on those missions... This game is a drisgrace and shouldn't even be called Mafia at all!
12897	Im a big fan of mafia. But not this one
12898	Bad game overall at this point.  - 30fps locked. - Maxed out 4K with AA set to 'Low' takes dips to 26fps on GTX 1080. - Textures are looking horrendous. - Doesn't look like a game as it was portrayed from gameplay videos, not even in visuals. - 4K scaling is bad, very very bad. The map and everything else is tiny. - It literally looks like a copy/paste from console version. - It looks decent at night times but not as good as shown in gameplay videos, day time is ugly.  Was eagerly waiting for this game to release, pre-ordered and everything just to find this poop of a product. Will update the review once patch is out, tried looking around in config files and couldn't find any option to unlock framerates but will continue to look further. Such a shame, I had high hopes for it. Will still play it for the storyline and what not, but this is a bummer. I doubt patches will revamp this game to a level one would want to play in 4K, it'll make it better but not turning too serious I'm afraid unless 2K can surprise us.  I'd suggest wait until they fix the game at least.    // EDIT: 5:24 PM Saturday, 8 October 2016 (PT) after Patch 1.01
12899	bad game dont buy it just becouse i have 23h in dont mean I like it. Its repetetiv main missions are like side missions  bad graphics 6/10. If you are fan of the franchise wait for drop in price.
12900	looks like â¥â¥â¥â¥ and almost fell asleep trying to play it
12901	Same thing over and over and over! Mafia 2 is way better!
12902	Everyone else already listed what's wrong with the game, some better than I'm able to  Strip everything you loved about Mafia 2 out of a Mafia game and add in some generic open world gameplay and you got Mafia 3
12903	Simply bad... after only 4h I realised the game is just way too shallow and just not worth any of my time. Money is better spent on Indie titles these days than overhyped AAA titles that get pushed out way too early. And wtf is up with the skybox?? That looks like super mario on the N64, heck that skybox looked better... Then add the random crashes... enough. Then when you compare with Mafia II it hits you in the face that M2 actually had more depth than this game..   Sad really. The story is good, the cutscenes are good but the rest, well just shallow.
12904	not worth the money. wait until its atleast 50% off then it might be
12905	I wish the game would be playable at its current state, but the lack of higher framerate makes me feel sick when I try to play. This needs to be fixed!
12906	False advertisement 30fps lock in the game looks terrible. Will probably try to get a refund for this one disappointing
12907	This is so infuriating! I can tell that Mafia 3 has a great game hidden under the metric ton of â¥â¥â¥â¥ its been shipped with. The characters are interesting, the style in which the story is being delivered so far is new and captivating.  But yes, there's a multitude of problems that have arrived with its release. The 30fps is a pain in the â¥â¥â¥â¥, sure, but I would be able to look passed that if it was polished elsewhere. However, the texures are abysmal, and the pop-in is horrendous. Even If I dismissed those glaring problems as well, I would still be left disappointed. Due to the 30fps, I'm playing with a controller, as I find the framerate more managable that way. But, I have to put up with the missing button prompts. Not even the 'controller layout' page shows the button mapping.  I know the devs have been working hard to fix this, but until they do, the frustation is not worth it. Wait until you hear of some major patch work before forking out for this game.  Damnit Mafia 3! I really want to play you!  [EDIT]  The patch has been release to unlock the framerate. But the bugs and stability is still a â¥â¥â¥â¥ show. Games seems ok other than those issues.
12908	Still massivley buggy aadn repetive. Wait for a sale. This game needed another six months before release.
12909	I'll start with the good things. Donovan, awesome character, awesome dialogue and awesome even though short, moments with him, especially the credits scene. The atmosphere while sometimes weird due to strange cloud speed and fast weather changes, was pretty good. Soundtrack is sort of a mixed bag, I personally didnt like it that much, but I wont comment much since it depends on each persons music taste. Ok'ish stealth mechanics, i certainly liked going stealthy rather than full on assault, so that was a plus. Now the bad things are pretty much everything thats left, sadly. The story, the characters that arent fleshed out as much as I wanted, such as Vitto( you do find out what happens to Joe though I have a feeling regarding an ending scene that what Vitto revealed might not be the case), the gameplay is horribly boring, lacks excitement, basically the game is the most average game I've played. Its not bad but its not good either. You wont miss anything for not playing the game, hence why Im not recommending it, maybe if it goes on sale under 15$.
12910	If you are a streamer or youtuber and thinking of buying this game to put it on youtube done because it is a nightmare it repeatedly freezes obs and x split nvidia shadowplay does not like it either when you go to edit it you need to move the game sound around as it goes out of sink with there mouths and gun bullets and it is not as good as the last two they have made it to much like gta but they messed the buttons up i am not happy with this game at all
12911	I was excited to get and play Mafia 3. Watching the live E3 footage and getting the tshirt they handed out to the on hands attendees. After playing the game for near 7-8 hours I started noticing mission bugs. Then it just continued on and on and on and on. Now I am stuck in the story line because of these bugs. I am highly upset that I can not return this POS game. From Massives giant F-up with 'The Division' to Edios 'Duex Ex Manking Divied' and now on to this POS game. I am disapointed in the developers and publishers of these games. Yes I am looking at you Ubisoft, 2k and Square Enix. For the love of god fix your QC process NOW.   TLDR: Do not buy this Crappy game. Wait 6 months and get it for 15 bucks. Waste of money and NVMe Space.
12912	Where to start... First off let me say that I am a big fan of the Mafia series and had high hopes for this game.  This game has a VERY rich story, which is something I can't fault it for. That being said almost every other aspect of this game is lacking, HEAVILY.  Performance wise this game is having a hard time being run even by amazing hardware at anything above 1080p. I currently run an i5-4690k clocked at 4.3GHz paired with a 780ti. I currently have no problem running GTA V at pretty much max settings at 2k resolution. This game at 2k resolution unless set to low settings nets me around 30 frames. All of this is if the game decides not to crash itself after 30 minutes or so.   Gameplay is very repetitive as many other reviews will claim, this game is all about claiming territory from Sal Marcano and his criminal enterpise. A district has 2 lieutenants and 1 capo. To find and murder these people you must complete redundant tasks such as interrogating people for information, destroying and taking money from places they run, or simply killing a target. This causes the lieutenant to come out of hiding, then after completing that you do a mission to get the capo out of hiding and kill them. The side missions are one and the same, either kill or fetch tasks that never bring anything new to the table.   Visually the game does not look good at all, I've been told that the textures are all in 720p and then sampled up to your resolution, a telltale sign of a console port.   There are a few things that I want to point out in gameplay and realism that this game did very poorly: #1 AI #2 Physics #3 Realism  As far as AI goes no matter what difficulty you are on all AI will be lumbering idiots that couldn't stop a fly. You can't interact with any non essential characters in the game besides saying hello every once in a while. For the game taking place in the south in the 1960's and for the cops being bought off by Sal Marcano you'd think they'd be a big obstacle for a colored man. The police won't bat an eye unless called. Speed past them through a red light? nothing. Hit a car going 90 miles an hour right in front of them? Nothing. Barely bump their car? They have an apb out on you and shoot to kill. Though for what it is I will say the system of cops not having some sort of internal gps that lets them always know where you are after someone reports a crime is a good step away from the gameplay of GTA where cops know every single time where you are. Also the shotgun toting mafiosos who think they're invinvible is a bit dim.   For physics this game barely has any, Lincoln can jump out of a car completely horizontally no matter what speed he's going and and land exactly next to where his door was when he jumped out. Cars magically hop into the air when being hit.   For realism? Lets talk about how car crashes at 90mph don't kill you, and barely scratch your car, gators are invincible and always are there to eat a body after it falls remotely in a body of water among other things.  In Mafia 2 you could actually shoot enough that the hubcap of the car would come off. Car crashes at even 50 mph could kill you instantly. You can hit any random non hostile npc with one melee and they're instantly knocked out, there are no consequences for robbing a store beides the police might get called, even if you murder someone in there (wheras in mafia 2 you couldn't go back for a while and there was police tape).   Is this review well written and formatted? Probably not. Does it accurately describe the state of this game? I think so.  I had been trying to just accept this game so much, being a fan of the series, I wanted it to be good but the more I took a good look at it I saw what a dissapointment it really was. Even if this game had looked good and ran great across the board I don't think it would be worth it. They took a really engaging story and ruined everything else inbetween. Territory grabbing missions are just pointless things that lead to unlock more bits of the story. You can't customise your character in any way, your cars in any way, have a garage to store them. Little bits of detail like bums, and small npc interactions would make this game feel a lot more real. Overall I wish that the developers of this game hadn't let us down in this way. The opening mission was great, do this, drive here, and then there were different steps to complete to finish. They were all important and drove everything forward. That was how they should have done the whole game, open world but actual missions instead of annoying chore like tasks. Nobody playing a Mafia game wants to run the day to day operations, but to understand and delve deep into what being in the mob actually feels like, the nitty gritty bits, the fighting, the honor code, all that.   I give this game a 5/10, and that may just be me being generous.  
12913	Mafia 1 and 2 are much better games. Mafia 3 is basically objectively bad, you do the same â¥â¥â¥â¥ to draw someone out to kill them and rinse repeat until the end. It's tedious and a chore to play. After the first 2 hours you've seen everything the game has to offer and then it just sends you to different regions of the city hitting rackets again until enough damage is inflicted to draw out another enemy to kill.
12914	Don't buy this, at first, I thought the game had a interesting story and i give it an second chance. Very disapointed.
12915	TL;DR The story and the soundtrack is good and that's pretty much it. Wait until there's a sale for the game or buy Mafia II/Mafia I
12916	Mafia III, the follow up to the legendary Mafia and Mafia II video games. I was very hyped for this game and was anticipating an epic game much like Grand Theft Auto V. However, there are a few things that make gameplay a less enjoyable experience.  Let me start off by saying the story is excellent, and while I haven't played through the entire game yet, I will hopefully change this review by the end of all the DLCs and updates. The story is very engaging and unique. There are also plenty of elements that reinforce the notion of racism during this period: such as when police respond slower and the dispatcher uses words like 'maybe' in poorer, black neighborhoods.  However, story aside, the game is hard to love when the physics and graphics are sub-par. While the game does look pretty at times, there are some glaring details I cannot forgive. The first thing you'll notice is that the graphics are wonky at times. The lighting and reflections and wonky and the chrome on the cars looks more like matte plastic with a metallic paint. Sometimes the immediate world also darkens and lightens as if the developers wanted to emulate clouds obscuring the sun intermittently but it comes across as jarring. At night New Bordeaux looks very beautiful though. I think the developer added too many post-process effects that take away from the performance, this should be looked into but I think the only way to fix this is to redo the entire game engine.  As mentioned the physics and overall feel of the game is lacking. Driving feels like the cars are driving with ice wheels. While yes, older American cars had wonky and floaty suspensions, and the game allows them to leans as such, the wheels are like they are made of ice and the cars feel lighter than they look. The physical damage on cars is also dissapointing as I was looking up to GTA V and taking cues from older movies where the sheet metal cars would actually tear themselves apart after a collision. Colliding with people also seems like an unfinished feature. I feel the devs would have had a better time if they used Natural Motion as the people are more like lamp posts with animations coming in late. Sometimes the AI driven cars have erratic driving that is pretty annoying to deal with: they would be spinning around in an 'S' shape right in front of me and would clip through other cars until they are right in front of me, where the game engine decides that they should have collision again.  Another point of contention is general gameplay. I'm currently in the stage where I'm running introductory jobs for Cassandra, Vito, and Burke. But all of these characters have had the same type of missions to regain control of their respective territories: go there, bop that guy until the big boss guy gets anfry and shows his face, go back to the same large wardehouse place you bopped one guy to get the big guy, finished. As stated, I haven't finished the main story yet, but I hope the missions are not going to be monogamous for the rest of the crew again.  Tldr; well told story, everything else is sub-par. Get this game on sale or a few years down the line.
12917	The game crashes after 15 minutes of gameplay! â¬49.99 for this â¥â¥â¥â¥? Fix it! Always we as the paying gamers get screwed by devs!!!!
12918	I've played the game for about 1 hour right after downloading it. It ran fine although with 30 FPS locked. However my GTX 960 4GB usage was quite low - about 55-60% - which is expected for 30 frames. So I hoped everything will be just great when developers release 60 FPS and unlimited FPS patch.  Then after an hour smooth ran (in 30 FPS) game crashed and refused to launch again. I tried eveything I could find to resolve the issue but no luck. The only thing that helped me - rolling back Nvidia drivers to previous version, BUT it was running fine on the latest drivers before that crush, WTF?! Now game runs like a crap - not playable at all.  My PC specs - Intel i5-4690k @3.9 Ghz, 16 GB RAM, Nvidia Geforce GTX 960 4GB.  I'm very dissapointed. Would not recommend to buy this game...at least now. Also seriously considering to make refund if the patch doesn't come and fix all this within this weekend. Shame on you developers!
12919	Still massivley buggy aadn repetive. Wait for a sale. This game needed another six months before release.
12920	I'll start with the good things. Donovan, awesome character, awesome dialogue and awesome even though short, moments with him, especially the credits scene. The atmosphere while sometimes weird due to strange cloud speed and fast weather changes, was pretty good. Soundtrack is sort of a mixed bag, I personally didnt like it that much, but I wont comment much since it depends on each persons music taste. Ok'ish stealth mechanics, i certainly liked going stealthy rather than full on assault, so that was a plus. Now the bad things are pretty much everything thats left, sadly. The story, the characters that arent fleshed out as much as I wanted, such as Vitto( you do find out what happens to Joe though I have a feeling regarding an ending scene that what Vitto revealed might not be the case), the gameplay is horribly boring, lacks excitement, basically the game is the most average game I've played. Its not bad but its not good either. You wont miss anything for not playing the game, hence why Im not recommending it, maybe if it goes on sale under 15$.
12921	Realy bad This is not what I expected. Trash Also Look this video which game have more detail ?  Mafia 1 vs Mafia 3 !!! LOL   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ1YMeY07xI 
12922	I was excited to get and play Mafia 3. Watching the live E3 footage and getting the tshirt they handed out to the on hands attendees. After playing the game for near 7-8 hours I started noticing mission bugs. Then it just continued on and on and on and on. Now I am stuck in the story line because of these bugs. I am highly upset that I can not return this POS game. From Massives giant F-up with 'The Division' to Edios 'Duex Ex Manking Divied' and now on to this POS game. I am disapointed in the developers and publishers of these games. Yes I am looking at you Ubisoft, 2k and Square Enix. For the love of god fix your QC process NOW.   TLDR: Do not buy this Crappy game. Wait 6 months and get it for 15 bucks. Waste of money and NVMe Space.
12923	Where to start... First off let me say that I am a big fan of the Mafia series and had high hopes for this game.  This game has a VERY rich story, which is something I can't fault it for. That being said almost every other aspect of this game is lacking, HEAVILY.  Performance wise this game is having a hard time being run even by amazing hardware at anything above 1080p. I currently run an i5-4690k clocked at 4.3GHz paired with a 780ti. I currently have no problem running GTA V at pretty much max settings at 2k resolution. This game at 2k resolution unless set to low settings nets me around 30 frames. All of this is if the game decides not to crash itself after 30 minutes or so.   Gameplay is very repetitive as many other reviews will claim, this game is all about claiming territory from Sal Marcano and his criminal enterpise. A district has 2 lieutenants and 1 capo. To find and murder these people you must complete redundant tasks such as interrogating people for information, destroying and taking money from places they run, or simply killing a target. This causes the lieutenant to come out of hiding, then after completing that you do a mission to get the capo out of hiding and kill them. The side missions are one and the same, either kill or fetch tasks that never bring anything new to the table.   Visually the game does not look good at all, I've been told that the textures are all in 720p and then sampled up to your resolution, a telltale sign of a console port.   There are a few things that I want to point out in gameplay and realism that this game did very poorly: #1 AI #2 Physics #3 Realism  As far as AI goes no matter what difficulty you are on all AI will be lumbering idiots that couldn't stop a fly. You can't interact with any non essential characters in the game besides saying hello every once in a while. For the game taking place in the south in the 1960's and for the cops being bought off by Sal Marcano you'd think they'd be a big obstacle for a colored man. The police won't bat an eye unless called. Speed past them through a red light? nothing. Hit a car going 90 miles an hour right in front of them? Nothing. Barely bump their car? They have an apb out on you and shoot to kill. Though for what it is I will say the system of cops not having some sort of internal gps that lets them always know where you are after someone reports a crime is a good step away from the gameplay of GTA where cops know every single time where you are. Also the shotgun toting mafiosos who think they're invinvible is a bit dim.   For physics this game barely has any, Lincoln can jump out of a car completely horizontally no matter what speed he's going and and land exactly next to where his door was when he jumped out. Cars magically hop into the air when being hit.   For realism? Lets talk about how car crashes at 90mph don't kill you, and barely scratch your car, gators are invincible and always are there to eat a body after it falls remotely in a body of water among other things.  In Mafia 2 you could actually shoot enough that the hubcap of the car would come off. Car crashes at even 50 mph could kill you instantly. You can hit any random non hostile npc with one melee and they're instantly knocked out, there are no consequences for robbing a store beides the police might get called, even if you murder someone in there (wheras in mafia 2 you couldn't go back for a while and there was police tape).   Is this review well written and formatted? Probably not. Does it accurately describe the state of this game? I think so.  I had been trying to just accept this game so much, being a fan of the series, I wanted it to be good but the more I took a good look at it I saw what a dissapointment it really was. Even if this game had looked good and ran great across the board I don't think it would be worth it. They took a really engaging story and ruined everything else inbetween. Territory grabbing missions are just pointless things that lead to unlock more bits of the story. You can't customise your character in any way, your cars in any way, have a garage to store them. Little bits of detail like bums, and small npc interactions would make this game feel a lot more real. Overall I wish that the developers of this game hadn't let us down in this way. The opening mission was great, do this, drive here, and then there were different steps to complete to finish. They were all important and drove everything forward. That was how they should have done the whole game, open world but actual missions instead of annoying chore like tasks. Nobody playing a Mafia game wants to run the day to day operations, but to understand and delve deep into what being in the mob actually feels like, the nitty gritty bits, the fighting, the honor code, all that.   I give this game a 5/10, and that may just be me being generous.  
12924	not worth the money. wait until its atleast 50% off then it might be
12925	Mafia 3 is a pile of horse â¥â¥â¥â¥ compared to Mafia 2. I regret spending 60 dollars on this game because all you do is grind, same boring crap over &amp; over !
12926	Worst game ever on my Steam account.
12927	developer believed this is one of the best thier game because they sold 4.5 million copies within first week , fastest in 2k his i'm disappointed with this game and 2k. loop this all game drive , rob , drive , kill , drive  mafia 2 is better
12928	REFUNDED, Poor graphics for a triple A title. Yet again crap consloe port.
12929	After the update the game is improved and there is now a steady FPS and the textures are no longer blurry and grainy. I love the enviroment and the music of the era, it really is nice to see a little something of what the 70's was like in this game. Even though I love everything about the game I still cannot recommend it for the performance, sure the game is now over 30 FPS and is now at a FPS that bounces between 25 to 60 FPS, mostly 40 though. Funny thing is that I am right with the game recommendations that are listed talking about having a GTX 780 or 8GB of RAM. I don't wanna sound like a freak that wants everything looking 100% but, I can't bring myself to play it with the all the FPS issues, makes me really sick to drive at a solid 25 FPS on a 144Hz monitor...
12930	this game is really baddly made. wasted Â£52 on this garbage. constantly crashing utter â¥â¥â¥â¥.
12931	One word : refund. Where can i get refund about this peace of â¥â¥â¥â¥? ??
12932	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game in its current state. It is the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥iest port to PC I have seen since Arkham Knight. Can maybe pull off 40 FPS with my GTX 780 and i7-4790k on low settings. Awful graphics, awful optimization, awful game right now. I am requesting a refund currently. Maybe if they fix the game at some point I'll give it another try but in its current state it is garbage.
12933	Realy bad This is not what I expected. Trash Also Look this video which game have more detail ?  Mafia 1 vs Mafia 3 !!! LOL   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQ1YMeY07xI 
12934	Mafia III, the follow up to the legendary Mafia and Mafia II video games. I was very hyped for this game and was anticipating an epic game much like Grand Theft Auto V. However, there are a few things that make gameplay a less enjoyable experience.  Let me start off by saying the story is excellent, and while I haven't played through the entire game yet, I will hopefully change this review by the end of all the DLCs and updates. The story is very engaging and unique. There are also plenty of elements that reinforce the notion of racism during this period: such as when police respond slower and the dispatcher uses words like 'maybe' in poorer, black neighborhoods.  However, story aside, the game is hard to love when the physics and graphics are sub-par. While the game does look pretty at times, there are some glaring details I cannot forgive. The first thing you'll notice is that the graphics are wonky at times. The lighting and reflections and wonky and the chrome on the cars looks more like matte plastic with a metallic paint. Sometimes the immediate world also darkens and lightens as if the developers wanted to emulate clouds obscuring the sun intermittently but it comes across as jarring. At night New Bordeaux looks very beautiful though. I think the developer added too many post-process effects that take away from the performance, this should be looked into but I think the only way to fix this is to redo the entire game engine.  As mentioned the physics and overall feel of the game is lacking. Driving feels like the cars are driving with ice wheels. While yes, older American cars had wonky and floaty suspensions, and the game allows them to leans as such, the wheels are like they are made of ice and the cars feel lighter than they look. The physical damage on cars is also dissapointing as I was looking up to GTA V and taking cues from older movies where the sheet metal cars would actually tear themselves apart after a collision. Colliding with people also seems like an unfinished feature. I feel the devs would have had a better time if they used Natural Motion as the people are more like lamp posts with animations coming in late. Sometimes the AI driven cars have erratic driving that is pretty annoying to deal with: they would be spinning around in an 'S' shape right in front of me and would clip through other cars until they are right in front of me, where the game engine decides that they should have collision again.  Another point of contention is general gameplay. I'm currently in the stage where I'm running introductory jobs for Cassandra, Vito, and Burke. But all of these characters have had the same type of missions to regain control of their respective territories: go there, bop that guy until the big boss guy gets anfry and shows his face, go back to the same large wardehouse place you bopped one guy to get the big guy, finished. As stated, I haven't finished the main story yet, but I hope the missions are not going to be monogamous for the rest of the crew again.  Tldr; well told story, everything else is sub-par. Get this game on sale or a few years down the line.
12935	FPS lock is horrible. Atmosphere is great but make sure you use motion blur.  Still, i get headaches after 2 hours. Nice job 2K. :p
12936	Do not buy this crap !
12937	I think basically it's a decent game, with questionable graphics and glitches, though. However, it's not the good old Mafia - which I've loved - anymore. So my feelings about it are ambiguous.
12938	This must be a joke right ?? okay it is quite atmospheric and the story could be cool too but the really BAD graphics make it feel like I am playing GTA 3 though ! The overall impression of the textures and the fine details of the city, people etc. is really horrible because it looks totally bad and for me in 2016 with GTA 5 as a rival that is nothing but a damn bad move from 2K. Btw. I am playing in 4K everything on the highest but it looks like driver I on playstation, okay now I am kidding but for real, when I open Mafia II which is over 6 years old I don't see that much difference for real ! I have hoped for much more actually not to mention 30fps lock haha NOT WORTH THE MONEY AT ALL I am ordering a refund right now...
12939	worth..not..30fps...refund
12940	The game keeps crashing on the prologue even though all my drivers are up to date. I even put all the setting on low and this hasn't solved the issue.
12941	The game crashes after 15 minutes of gameplay! â¬49.99 for this â¥â¥â¥â¥? Fix it! Always we as the paying gamers get screwed by devs!!!!
12942	I've played the game for about 1 hour right after downloading it. It ran fine although with 30 FPS locked.

12943	bloody fix the bloddy game its almost been one month couldnt even paly the game until now
12944	Since the update, the game has crashed twice within half an hour. It runs poorly on low settings, at 1440p. I have a GTX 970.  A paraplegic would run better than this.
12945	(Spoilers)I just want to start off by telling you i really enjoyed this game when i was able to play it. After 27 hours in game ive experienced a game breaking bug. My story missions refuse to show on the map. After i killed the hitman sal sent after me the game bugged. After i killed him somehow he was still alive along with his goons.....even after the cutscene. The story missions are not showing on the map anymore and i am angry. Ive spent $80 on this game and believe i deserve a refund since i cant get in touch with a human being to help me with this problem. I reccomend this game if you want to get â¥â¥â¥â¥ed by hanger 13
12946	I was highly looking forward to this game. However upon launching it was clear the developers had never considered ultrawide monitors (at least for the unusable menus) I was able to look past this somewhat big issue. Even the 30fps cap at first wasn't a total deal breaker for me. What really upset me was loosing a good 5 hours of campaign progress TWICE. Apparently there is an autosave after every mission but 2-3 seprate times the game did not save any progress. I made it up to the part where you clear the brothel each time. Randomly died and was reset all the way back to the swamp mission where you bill the hatian leader. ALL OF MY PROGRESS NEVER SAVED and I wasted a good 10 hours of my life. I tried looking for a solution online but nothing helped there was no data for any of my saves in the game files. Nothing to show for all my hours playing. I'm so dissapointed I'm requesting a refund.
12947	I'm so tired of developers making games for the console then ported to PC.  I'm so tired of this â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥.  Listen to every negative comment here. They are all right.  Wait till this game is on sale that or never buy this game at all.    
12948	Well - this has to be the worst waste of money ever. Since I purchase3d the game in Oct - I still have not been able to play the game. As soon as I click on start- it crashes, back to my desktop.. Somehow it says that I have played 31 hours of the game. I dont know how... I haven't been able to play it at all. Wen I requesteda refund from Steam - the reason they rejected my request was because of the 31 hours played, it was eithor that or the over 14 days since purchased. Neothor work well for me cause I work out of town for 2 weeks at a time. Every time I come back - I hope that there is some kind of patch for this game, but the developers just seem not to care that they are ruining thier reputation. BY FAR WORST GAME EVER...NOT PLAYED...
12949	Great story.. that's about it... this game is terrible..
12950	Not great... boring, story virtually non-existent... keep away from that title.
12951	In short words,this game is a joke.
12952	Do not buy.  Mafia 2 is infinitely better, play that instead.   Even without the bugs, the game is repetitive and contains none of the little details that made Mafia 2 stand out from GTA. Poor graphics quality, upscaled 720p, poor optimisation, 30fps locked at launch. It's obvious that this is the studios first game. On the surface it looks like a compotent GTA clone set in the 60s, but in reality it has little content and nothing to make it stand out. The cars don't feel like â¥â¥â¥â¥, but not a lot of effort was put into their functionality and mechanics.   Reminds me of Watchdogs.
12953	Summary:  All this game is is the same mission a million times over, and then you get to one unique mission, then back to the same repetitive bullcrap until you get to the next unique mission, and the cycle repeats. Those unique missions are fun, just not worth getting to. Not worth $60.  Pros:  -Good Graphics -Good Driving Mechanics -Fun Combat -Top Notch Voice Acting and Motion Capture -Great Soundtrack -Vito Scaletta  Cons:  -WHY IN HELL IS THE CLASSIC TOMMY GUN DLC?!?!? -2k gave a great franchise in the hand of first time developers -Repetitive and boring -Season Pass -Not enough Vito -Lincoln is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ -Cassandra is annoying -Terrible skybox  Conclusion:  I preordered this game as soon as I was able to being that I am a huge fan of the franchise, owning both Mafia and Mafia II. Mafia II is one of my favorite games of all time, so when I was able to buy this I went full Fry from Futurama and said 'Shut up and take my money!'. Sadly I failed to realize that this was Hangar 13's first game, and as more and more gameplay was released I saw that the game might be repetitve. I didn't care, however, being the massive fanboy that I am and I preordered the deluxe edition. There is no way that this game is worth $60, so it sure as hell ain't worth $80. This game was a massive failure. Do yourself a favor and buy Mafia II. You'll get your money's worth from that masterpiece.
12954	I purchased the game but I can't even start it,because my AMD CPU doesn't support SSE 4.1/4.2. Beware AMD CPU owners,you need FX family CPU to be able to run the game.I'm tired of this PC upgrading 'lifecycle',I'll be buying XBOX ONE S for christmas.
12955	Glitchy glitchy. Terribly unfinished. Looks like a 2008 game. Shame, cause the plot and voiceacting isnt too bad
12956	 Completed game before Reviewing
12957	Don't waste your time...  Almost as disappointing as No Mans Sky... 
12958	Very poor and repetative game play.
12959	1. Locks down my 144Hz monitor to 60Hz when using fullscreen mode. 2. Absolutely unplayable in stereoscopic 3D. 3. No option for using raw mouse input. 4. Default lock at 30Fps.
12960	Well - this has to be the worst waste of money ever. Since I purchase3d the game in Oct - I still have not been able to play the game. As soon as I click on start- it crashes, back to my desktop.. Somehow it says that I have played 31 hours of the game. I dont know how... I haven't been able to play it at all.

12965	bloody fix the bloddy game its almost been one month couldnt even paly the game until now
12966	Not great... boring, story virtually non-existent... keep away from that title.
12967	Some people would say No Man's Sky is the most disappointing game of the decade, but that would require you to be dumb enough to think a procedurally generated game can ever be something special.   Mafia lll easily takes that title. It could have and should have been great, but ends up being a POS that looks like it came out in 2008 yet still manages to run like trash even on the most powerfull PCs.
12968	Mafia 2 is much better than this game !
12969	not worth it
12970	I guess the game is solid on story but the technical side of the game is poorly exceuted 4k and sli 980s gave 18fps i had to down scale my resolutin few steps to be able to play on that 30 i dont really care about 60fps or what not my self but even if it would support such fps i could not reach it.  Driving feels really clunky i played the game to the bar in the tutorial sections all the models and graphics are subpar out side cutsecens.   I will now request a refound and wait till the game comes out in next years christmass sale or something, just so i can play the story with discount.
12971	TL;DR review  Pro's * Great artstyle * Mature 1960's setting * Shooting and melee combat feels very good * Badass main character * Great animations * Great voice acting  Con's * Cover system is dissapointing * Occasional hard crash * Awful AI * Repetitive gameplay after around 4 hours * Not much customization options * Story only interresting the first 2 to 3 hours * Performance not very good only getting 55 to 60 fps on unlimited framerate on a 980ti As a side note i think fps is locked at 60 even with the unlimited fps setting since 1080 and 980ti have exactly the same performance * The open world feels empty  Basicly i do not think it is worth the money at the moment, only the first few hours are interresting after that it is repetitive open world gameplay with barely any reward.
12972	Mafia 2 is much better than this game !
12973	Got ripped off because thought it was going to be as good as Mafia 2.  Wasted â¥â¥â¥â¥ing 60 dollars now I want a refund
12974	Boring do not buy it first 10 hours is great and then it's sucks.
12975	It started really nice..  The story is very good, the movies and animations are great! BUT:  It's horribly repetitive! It's alway the same pattern: 1. New city part 2. Talk with someone 3. Kill some groups of enemy boss 4. Boss comes out of his hole 5. Kill boss 6. Give control of city to partner 7. Repeat!  There are certain things that are damn annoying! Like: 1. It's not possible to shoot someone next to a tree.. the object hitboxes are catastrophic. They are at least 0.5m bigger than the object!  2. The cover system is horrible. Most time I only try to hide behind a certain object.. but the model has some other opinions..  3. I had to restart the game at least 100 times because of stuck missions (Game doesn't load animations). And other bugs like: after minimizing the game, mouse pointer keeps appearing.  But still.. the worst part in the end is the repetitive storyline..
12976	30 FPS lock is beatuiful , loving it,
12977	Summary:  All this game is is the same mission a million times over, and then you get to one unique mission, then back to the same repetitive bullcrap until you get to the next unique mission, and the cycle repeats.

Sadly I failed to realize that this was Hangar 13's first game, and as more and more gameplay was released I saw that the game might be repetitve. I didn't care, however, being the massive fanboy that I am and I preordered the deluxe edition. There is no way that this game is worth $60, so it sure as hell ain't worth $80.

12978	It's like running a potato on a CPU on a server on a furnace over ketchup and then waiting for new ingredients monthly with lack of resources.
12979	Some people would say No Man's Sky is the most disappointing game of the decade, but that would require you to be dumb enough to think a procedurally generated game can ever be something special.

12980	Horrible optimization, will change my review if they fix it.
12981	Repetitive missions.
12982	Watch Dogs 2 came out early, and surprise! It SUCKS!!!!   the ubisoft open world formula is getting real â¥â¥â¥â¥ing worn out.
12983	First: I got my money back! YAY!  To the game:  It's not worth a 1/10, that for it is a too good game.  Of course, I would also like to give it a 1/10, because it didn't fit with my expectations at all, but this game has very nice parts, like the cutscenes and the story.  Now, the problem is that Mafia III should have focus on the story instead of trying to be a 'GTA'. Even if it then was more linear, I think the game would have been better.  Thinks they messed up:  - AI - Gunfights (unrealistic hit feeling) - Driving - Colisions and car damage - Particles - Repetitive gameplay after the story part (it's like AC and Far cry from the principe) - Bugs and crashes (many) - Releasing with 30 FPS lock (yepp, that was a MESS! In 2016 PC Masterrace plays @ 120 Hz)  Good:  + Story + Setting + Gangstahs + Cutscenes + Characters + Storytelling + Motion capturing and facial expressions  This is a solid game, but nothing for a real mafia fan.  I give it a 5 / 10... not more.
12984	I have played Mafia I, Mafia II and i must say, Mafia III is far from being as good as its ancestors.  Not everything is bad though. Probably the storyline, the cutscenes and how the story is assembled is great i think. I really enjoyed it very much.  But the gameplay doesnt cut it. The whole game is soooo repetitive. They tried doing this GTA style, but it visible they dont know how to do it. the missions are all just the same and it becomes just a grind. And that just really kills the game.  To sum it up: as a Movie, great. As a game, trash.    
12985	Worst Mafia EVER - PERIOD. I played the first two mafia titles and I count them very high in my 'Best PC Games ever' list. But this one is just horrible. Repetitve gameplay from the first mission on hard to do any good storytelling with thoose game mechanics. DO NOT BUY!
12986	Nothing like the other Mafia series which was so good. In this third installment instead of climbing the ranks of the Mafia you are instead tearing down the mafia. Its like a really poorly done Godfather game. There is no enjoyment of the freeplay and the story is pretty tacky the entire time.
12987	I guess the game is solid on story but the technical side of the game is poorly exceuted 4k and sli 980s gave 18fps i had to down scale my resolutin few steps to be able to play on that 30 i dont really care about 60fps or what not my self but even if it would support such fps i could not reach it.  Driving feels really clunky i played the game to the bar in the tutorial sections all the models and graphics are subpar out side cutsecens.   I will now request a refound and wait till the game comes out in next years christmass sale or something, just so i can play the story with discount.
12988	TL;DR review  Pro's * Great artstyle * Mature 1960's setting * Shooting and melee combat feels very good * Badass main character * Great animations * Great voice acting  Con's * Cover system is dissapointing * Occasional hard crash * Awful AI * Repetitive gameplay after around 4 hours * Not much customization options * Story only interresting the first 2 to 3 hours * Performance not very good only getting 55 to 60 fps on unlimited framerate on a 980ti As a side note i think fps is locked at 60 even with the unlimited fps setting since 1080 and 980ti have exactly the same performance * The open world feels empty  Basicly i do not think it is worth the money at the moment, only the first few hours are interresting after that it is repetitive open world gameplay with barely any reward.
12989	I just want to try and keep the review short and simple whats right and what's wrong.  Right - Great music Fun new gameplay for Mafia  Voice acting was on point Portrayed the racism from back then maybe it overdid it but gave us an idea how things have changed from then and now Nice array of scenary from the swamps, to lower class living areas to mid class all the way to upper tier mansions etc Killing district bosses satisfying the missions to them are usually done quite well  The bad - Extremely repetitive by this I mean  Taking over districts never change they're always done in the same fashion i.e. Talk to one person this person will tell you a bunch of vague infromation and name the guy you're targetting after that you will get a bunch of side missions which pop up which will be the following Interregotation, freeing prisoners, killing the professionals in their orginisation then finally destroying their goods/contraband After you've done the damage neccessary you will go back to the same person talk to him he tells you some more stuff about where the guy is which will be in a location you've already likely shot up before sooo... back to the same place shoot everyone up and execute the boss, assign to one of the three underbosses Once that has all been completed you do it all over again ONCE more for the same district I â¥â¥â¥â¥ you not you do the same thing over again and once you complete it a second time that is when you get to kill district boss. Then once the district boss is dead you fully assign the district to one of the three.  I knew I said I wouldn't make it long but I thought I had to describe that down so people would see how boring it is.  The other bad to the game is - Side missions are like taking over districts they're extremely repetitive as well No real customisation to vehicles No clothe stores instead wear the same thing for the whole playthrough Shops out in the open have no real use they're just there for nothing instead of holding playboy mags etc No complexity to owning districts Graphics are far from impressive Draw distance in the game isn't good Bugs galore all over the place you'll find weird happenings whilst playing Driving is debatable but I dislike it I feel like the car physics is awful and often found myself dreading having to drive which brings me to the next issue No fast travelling instead you have to travel from A to Z all by yourself very time consuming which would explain why the game lasted as long as it did for me Story was quite bland the one priest blabbing away about Lincoln in the present about Lincoln in the past but nobody really cares it jumps from present to past so often and I feel like they hurt their story by not keeping it in the past telling the story the way they did didn't improve anything it just made things confusing and jumped all over the place they could have easily jumped to a final clip of the priest in his present days at the end of the game that would have been the right touch to finish the story off instead of jumping from cutscenes willy nilly.  That;s all I can think of it was a big let down.  5/10 If I was to score it.
12990	I wouldn't reccomand this game at this point in time as there is an FPS lock, The game dosen't support ultra wide screens, map, blood stains, main menu all at 1080 res... 
12991	PROS:  Excellent hook in the beginning storyline Memorable Characters Sound track is amazing I only crashed twice so far    CONS: You never feel accomplished with missions Feeling 'empowered' or leveling up is few and far between Day and night cycle is strange, I have artifacting everywhere AI is the worst I have seen Driving is a chore The best car you can unlock as delivery has this HIGH pitch whine to it. Makes it unbearable with the sound on. Imagine an electronic whine but at a very noticable level Car physics are strange, when you crash you never total. I've flipped the car over 3 times and kept going in my intended direction The physical fighting is an absolute joke, spam one button to win Game feels way too easy, even on hard difficulty and AA turned off You die to random things all the time Having to restart quests at 7 different spots due to bugs City feels empty and everyone looks the same Pedestrians all say the same thing when you pass them. I had 4 guys say the exact same audio file when I passed by Collecting everything around the city is a job All the quests are the same thing after 2 hours of gameplay Skybox is terrible With a Mafia game I was expecting more brutal ways to kill people, not just the same knife stabbing or butt stroking (butt of the gun)  Verdict: Wait for a Steam Sale
12992	GTA: New Bordeaux 5/10
12993	the graphics is so â¥â¥â¥â¥ , so many glitches
12994	SUMMARY After Mafia 2 this game comes after 6 years of difficult development. I must say I am very disapponted. The first 3 hours are really good, but after that you do the same damn stuff for like 30 hours, which gets boring really quick. I enjoyed few facts ( and few moments ) about the game, but it isn't enough for me to reccomend. Also pay attention to the horrible optimalization of the game.  59/100  PROS - really good radio soundtrack - almost all of the characters are well written, as well as the dialogues - the car models look very realistic and nice - I liked the way the cutscenes were made - the game continues the story the same way Mafia 2 continued Mafia's story - just through few details - Lincoln is not as â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ generic character as it seemd from trailers  CONS - on my i5 2500 + gtx 970 the game ran at 50 fps at low details when not moving, it dropped to like 35 when driving - despite the how badly the game runs on most of PCs, the graphics look quite ugly and very blury - developers represent Mafia III as a story-based game, but after finishing I must say is has a very generic story and there aren't many plot twists - for about 30 hours you do the absolutly same thing over and over again, which gets boring after 5 hours ( so then you have 25 hours of boring gameplay ) - sometimes the game tries to a tell a serious story about war, racism and gangter families, but then you go and kill about 30 people in 5 minutes and nobody gives much â¥â¥â¥â¥ about it which kills the serious feeling  - quite a lot of physical and visual bugs, crashes aren't rare at all - for some reason you can not save the game ( it only has autosaves ) and you can have only 1 game save at time  TIP If you really want to play it I would definitely reccomend buying after 6+ months ( so the developers fix various technical problems ) and in sale because the game in my opinion is not worth 50 euros.
12995	The new aspect of the game (taking rackets and making money that way) nowhere near makes up for its unappealing story and lack of diversity. I expected so much more from the game, seeing as you would now be your own boss but it fell flat. The game is worth 30â¬ in my opinion and I would not recommend that you get it for anything above that.
12996	not worth it
12997	the pc port is horrible
12998	The Game Is Crashing on Startup.
12999	I like to consider myself an open world enthusiast. To me a good open world game should have concise and meaningful missions one after the other, with the occasional batch of side missions or a bunch of side activites to do when you don't feel like playing the story. This game however feels the need to make the player grind several repetitive missions before you get to the good story bits. Don't get me wrong, the way Hangar 13 did the story is amazing. I think the voice acting is great and the in game graphics during cutscenes are just awesome. But get the â¥â¥â¥â¥ outta here if you expect me to destroy this, interrogate that, kill him a million â¥â¥â¥â¥ing times BEFORE I get to enjoy your narrative.  Gameplay is fun but we need more mission variety! Also there's literally no customization of cars or your clothes. MAFIA 2 HAD THAT WTF. We need more things other than guns to spend money on. Not done with the game yet. There are things that will keep you in, such as the playboy magazines and especially the story. I'll keep playing, but whoever is thinking about buying it now: Don't. Wait until we see what the 'season pass' has to offer first. They may add â¥â¥â¥â¥ that will make this game worth it.
13000	  game craching what the â¥â¥â¥ screen freez
13001	I have to say i'm dissapointed to this game. The game is unfinished. The streets are very similiar almost anywhere you go. The game doesn't run well even with my geforce 1070 and it just lacks the feeling which I had in Mafia 2. Missions are also repetitive and it gets boring real quick. I had big hopes for this game and I bought it too fast, should have waited to see what others think and I must say, game that comes in 2016 shouldn't have this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ looking graphics. Don't buy this game, play mafia 2 instead. It is a masterpiece and it works.
13002	I got a refund, and you should to.  Low res texture, upscaled 720p, 30fps cap, choppy animations, bad AI, bland modern UI that is ugly, generic gameplay, repetitive missions...  This game is a sad excuse for a triple A release in 2016. Only good thing about it are the cutscenes and excellent story/setting, with its top-notch voice acting. However, you might as well just watch Goodfellas or The Godfather movie instead of wasting $60 on this crap.
13003	I can't personally recommend this game I played for about 5 hours and I'm hoping i get a refund
13004	The most pisspoor excuse for a Mafia game, I absolutely loved Mafia I and II, but this is horrendous, barely even a Mafia game.  -Average story (which is generic and predictable) -Looks and runs horrible/y -No customization -No interactability with the world -Repetitive missions  The only thing that saves it is the shooting and music.  Buy this game on sale. However for Mafia fans, this is an embarrasment to the series
13005	Another game where the developer give no â¥â¥â¥â¥s for PC players and doesn't optimise their â¥â¥â¥â¥. Trash Graphics, Trash Framerate, Trash AI. Good Story though so far.
13006	While initially entertaining, it quickly becomes a rinse and repeat of go here, stab/shoot these guys and install someone else to run â¥â¥â¥â¥ and pay you a paltry sum. Waste of money. Good music though...
13007	dumb ai locked 30fps crashed during play bad shoting performance and object destroy calculate compared with Mafia II bad optimize ui design ruin this game i even dont know what does game want to express through ui. maybe the guys from ubi soft in this design group have been influenced by their former company. anyway, i choose to refund!!
13008	Make it playable then maybe I'll finish it.
13009	  I cant get it to launch, ive spend hours trying to make it work, â¥â¥â¥â¥ GAME
13010	Alright, i've spent little over 7hrs on Mafia III now, and well it took that long for the fanboy in me to go F*** this c*** I've loved the Mafia franchise since the first (well apart from the racing in Mafia 1) but this i can't go along with.  So i wanna start with the good things, because there are some. The story and the way it's told is good. driving mechanics are fairly good (although the render distance with F*** you over a few times) City is a good size (gotta consider the small successes)  And then the bad things. I know not alot of good. Game is/was locked at 30FPS (Console port, FFS) Upscaled 720p textures, but you'd never know, because they are so frggin blurred out. It's comical and sad at the same time.  Render distance is a joke.  Keymapping is a mess, 'E' to open a door, 'F' to enter a car. why not have 'F' or 'E' do it for both?!  The AI, ehm yeah. Walked up to a guard in a hostile zone he spots me, i duck behind cover and just wait for him to come to me, and i do a takedown and all is good. I'm in a hostile zone, meaning restricted area, shoot on sight and that Sh**. oh on the note of AI, the police is worse than the gangsters/mobsters. Civilian just called in the police, i'm making ready for a stand off, police arrives and just sits in the patrol car doesn't shoot or get out.  Mafia III in it's current state, worth 10Euro (maybe) Don't waste your money wait for them to fix their Sh**
13011	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! I really wanted to like this game but it's so â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ boring. All the missions are the same and that's not an exageration. You will encounter glitches that can force you to restart the game all over again and it will exit itself out. After 18 hours I finally gave up and just looked up the ending.
13012	Awful PC port. Pretty sure they never even tested the game on PC before they released it. Even after they unlocked the 30 fps lock and allowed up to 60 fps or more I'm getting 52 fps in the game menu... the GAME MENU. I have a 980ti and i7-6700k 4.0ghz and I can run Witcher 3 on max graphics in 1440p at 60 fps. Also, the graphics have been downgraded from what they were showing in 2015. Do not reward these developers by buying this game.
13013	This is not mafia. That's all I can say. This is probably the biggest dissapointment of the year
13014	this game has still performance issues despite the update that is 5.8 gb. If this game's name was not mafia 3, 2k suffered a loss. People bought it because the early games of mafia series was brilliant. I will not trust 2k any more because of the mistakes that they have done in mafia 3. If you say that I have a significant gaming computer, there will be another problem for you while you play the game. MAFIA 3's performance repeats itself when you do some quests. AI is bad. Not terrible but still bad. AI can be fixed. I still play the mafia 3 although it has some problems. Because I love gangster's stories even though the story is not based by true events.   Finally; if you are obsessed about performences, I do not recommend you to buy it. If you love the gangsters, you might buy it. Have a nice day gamers....
13015	Pretty boring stale game, always 'kill certain amount/collect certain amount and advance to the mini boss, then repeat' sigh
13016	Crashes within 30 minutes, feels slow because of 30fps. Update is needed badly!
13017	Dude, The game optimization is a joke My PC: i5 6600k with OC  gtx 1080 8 gb of RAM  Mobo : gigabyte gaming 7  AND I can't play this game over 60 fps in 1080p in low setting ? W-T-F
13018	First: I got my money back! YAY!  To the game:  It's not worth a 1/10, that for it is a too good game.  Of course, I would also like to give it a 1/10, because it didn't fit with my expectations at all, but this game has very nice parts, like the cutscenes and the story.  Now, the problem is that Mafia III should have focus on the story instead of trying to be a 'GTA'. Even if it then was more linear, I think the game would have been better.  Thinks they messed up:  - AI - Gunfights (unrealistic hit feeling) - Driving - Colisions and car damage - Particles - Repetitive gameplay after the story part (it's like AC and Far cry from the principe) - Bugs and crashes (many) - Releasing with 30 FPS lock (yepp, that was a MESS! In 2016 PC Masterrace plays @ 120 Hz)  Good:  + Story + Setting + Gangstahs + Cutscenes + Characters + Storytelling + Motion capturing and facial expressions  This is a solid game, but nothing for a real mafia fan.  I give it a 5 / 10... not more.
13019	I have played Mafia I, Mafia II and i must say, Mafia III is far from being as good as its ancestors.  Not everything is bad though. Probably the storyline, the cutscenes and how the story is assembled is great i think. I really enjoyed it very much.  But the gameplay doesnt cut it. The whole game is soooo repetitive. They tried doing this GTA style, but it visible they dont know how to do it. the missions are all just the same and it becomes just a grind. And that just really kills the game.  To sum it up: as a Movie, great. As a game, trash.    
13020	Worst Mafia EVER - PERIOD. I played the first two mafia titles and I count them very high in my 'Best PC Games ever' list. But this one is just horrible. Repetitve gameplay from the first mission on hard to do any good storytelling with thoose game mechanics. DO NOT BUY!
13021	Nothing like the other Mafia series which was so good. In this third installment instead of climbing the ranks of the Mafia you are instead tearing down the mafia. Its like a really poorly done Godfather game. There is no enjoyment of the freeplay and the story is pretty tacky the entire time.
13022	Im not even complaining about the Graphics, i think they are okay...I think the jagged lines on the edge of everything is okay. I can play and enjoy a game with them.....However when an npc is 5 feet away and his face looks like two eyes and some hair is all i can see you know there is a problem....The game is way toooo blurry....It makes me sick playing....The blurryness is more of a problem than the 30fps issue. They say they are going to patch the fps...we will see... however i think the blurryness is an issue they need to address as well.....Food for thought i guess huh.....
13023	i would say no for right now, i would not mind the 30 fps cap since they did say they would update it later. the problem is i run this game at all max settings at 1440p resolution and the game has horrible blurry textures. not even when im high on weed it lets me enjoy the game with this type or resolution. its like they just ported console textures to pc for a place holder until the patch comes. until a mod or patch with hd textures come out i cant really recommend it. it looks like a game that was released for ps3 right now. this review will change if they fix this issue
13024	I played about 40min of this game and I couldn't get past how unoptimized the game was(got a refund), got 30fps with a GTX 970.. Just another console game with a terrible PC port
13025	Graphics are shocking, driving is like an arcade game. And there's no damage physics when you crash you car, it's fine. Or the graphics are that bad I can't notice. Doesn't look anything like the past Mafia games.  A complete shambles, worst PC port I've ever played.   I thought companies went forwards with new games, not three steps backwards. Doubt I'll buy another game in the Mafia franchise.
13026	Really dissapointing pre ordering and after release tell everyone the fps is capped. textures and graphics are pretty average/ blurry.  I am currently enjoying the story but would not recommend buying this game in its currnt state, feels like a really bad console port
13027	So this is what betrayal feels like... 1/10 would want to be betrayed again.   *Paint it black playing on the background*
13028	I liked Mafia II more... much, much more...   *Starting to realize that at least 99.9% of all these new AAA games are all going to suck assssssssss... RIP my video game hobby*
13029	Horrible graphics. Bloom loaded Vaseline basically. Makes your eyes bleed.
13030	This game had so much potential but sadly it just misses that special touch. Graphics are pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥, the game is poorly optimized and the missions aren't really that meaningful. I mean it does have story in it, but they streched it out too much.
13031	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME YET, WAIT FOR A PATCH  Horrible PC port, Locked at 30 FPS, low res textures in places, Visually It's not what you'd expect from a Triple A title in 2016, Overall gameplay feels clunky, The shooting mechanics are poor and feel incredibly inacurate from mid to long range due to a reticule that doesn't focus to a fixed point, The standard driving controls make the car feel as though It's floating on the road (However It's much better if you switch to simulation mode in the options) The game has a fantastic sound track and the cutscenes for the most part are quite good HOWEVER the cutscenes are so long and there's so many of them that you spend more time watching the game than actually playing it. Just as the story started to get really interesting I encountered a loading screen that I couldn't get past, I left it loading for 15 minutes and nothing, At that point I decided it was time to try for a refund.  Pros - Interesting Story - Great Soundtrack - Some of the cutscenes are well done - Good Voice Acting - The Driving Controls Are Better In 'Simulation Mode'  Cons - Ugly low res textures in many places on max graphics - Locked at 30FPS - No Windowed Borderless - Horrible Shooting Mechanics - Default Driving Controls Are Unrealistic And 'Floaty'  - Cutscenes are way too long and there's too many of them - Game Crashes Frequently  My system specs - Nvidia 980TI GPU - Intel i7 4790k 4.7Ghz - 32GB Ram - Windows 10 (Can run most games 60fps max settings no issues)
13032	+ Good story, great voice actors + Cool music  - Very linear - Extremely repetitive, most of the game you do the same four things over and over - Driving feels very arcade-y, and cars don't even deform when you crash - Some cars are impossible to drive, because they bug up and start bouncing - The AI is competely oblivious, making you practically invisible when sneaking - The AI also has no idea how to drive - Buggy, glitchy, poor performance - Everything that was good about Mafia 2 was taken out - For some reason you unlock the ability to steal cars silently -after- you get the ability to just order a better car to be delivered, free of charge - No customization - The map is huge, but mostly empty
13033	Mafia III is an exercise in tedium.  The first couple of hours are decent, then the story grinds to a halt as the player is tasked with taking over different rackets and districts of the city. This makes up the large majority of the game, and involves you driving between repetitive, filler-tier activities that take less time to complete than it does to drive over to them.  It's a shame, because the handful of properly-designed missions that are in the game are fairly decent. The combat is pretty slick, the enemies have good hit reactions to gunfire, and the gunfights can be quite fast-paced with the mouse and keyboard controls. Most of the gunfights in the game will last about thirty seconds to a minute though, considering the repetitive racket-takeover missions make up most of the time.  The game has a fair number of bugs, too. A few times I'd have to restart missions from a checkpoint because it bugged out and I couldn't progress. If you shoot and kill an enemy near a railing, they'll play an animation where they fall over the railing, but they'd often freeze at the point where the canned animation was supposed to transition to ragdoll physics, so they'd end up suspended in mid-air. If you have police chasing you and you call in the favour to get rid of the cops, they'll literally disappear right in front of you.  The optimisation is an issue, also. In my experience, they actually fixed the game up and had it running quite well through post-launch patches, but with the latest update (the one that introduces racing and car customisation), they seem to have reverted all of these optimisations and the game runs like crap again. You can't roll-back to previous builds through Steam either, so the only way to play the game with good performance now is to download a cracked version of the last build, which is absolutely ridiculous.  Overall, on the plus side - the game has a nice soundtrack and world; decent characters and acting; and good combat. On the other hand, there are only a few good missions hidden amongst 30 - 40 hours of absolute tedium; there are bugs; and the latest build screwed up the performance.  Would only recommend this if you can get it super cheap, and you're willing to accept the risk of possibly slipping in to a coma from mind-numbingly boring missions.
13034	Do not buy this game. Story is good cutscreen and a comabt is nice but the FPS is horrible. Game will crash down every time you play (PC).
13035	Tried to swim onto the riverbank, got stuck on an invisible wall.  This game is poorly made, and an insult to the Mafia line. I would not recommend you spend your money on this game. This is one of those games that you want to play but it's not worth the money. Mafia II was an incredible game, and anyone who has played that would obviously have high hopes for this.   Wait for a BIG sale for this game, or pirate it, because it's not worth anything more than $30.
13036	I really dislike this kind of console ports. Every game mechanic just screams: 'CONSOLE!' and it never feels like a real PC game. Additionally they changed the control settings with a patch. Absolutely unprofessional. And as some other reviewers already stated this game is more like a GTA clone but has nothing to do with a Mafia game.
13037	As of right now the game doesn't run; even after restarting Steam 3 times which is the protocol for other games that have issue starting...  Windows 10 x64 with all minimum specs surpassed, and some recommended met or surpassed.
13038	Worst game i played this year ( worse than no man's sky ), 99% features of mafia 2 is not exist , mafia 2 looks better in all ways, you can look at some youtube comparison videos, just a terrible return of mafia franchise, hope Hangar 13 not be working on next mafia game. 5/10 p.s and i will do not say about graphics and perfomance, because they are also insanely bad.
13039	Crappy port with outdated graphics and repetative missions.. Good story tho
13040	0.2 hours.... So i saw some reviews that said its ok but no its not. 1. the framerate is potato (i have an gtx 970) 2. I run on 1080p and looked like 900p 3. Just an awful port  So..... dont buy this game!
13041	side missions are the main missions
13042	This game is trash, only bought it because i wanted to know what happened after Mafia 2, and i didn't get any closure on that either smh.
13043	Holy **** this runs badly it's Arkham Knight all over again.
13044	This game sucks... mafia 1 and 2 was much better. the soundtrack it's amazing and the history it's ok but the gameplay has a lot o bugs and is very repetitive. Such a shame. 
13045	Holy **** this runs badly it's Arkham Knight all over again.
13046	This game sucks... mafia 1 and 2 was much better. the soundtrack it's amazing and the history it's ok but the gameplay has a lot o bugs and is very repetitive. Such a shame. 
13047	I have now completed the game and overall it was alright. It could have actually be great if developers made more focus on the main quest line and would bother to polish the PC port.  Lows: - You need to complete majority of side missions to progress with the story. - No hesists or robberies, just kill-kill-kill. - All side missions are nearly identical: confront (kill or interrogate) someone or destroy stuff. - You get good weapons way too early in the game, meaning you stick with them to the end. - Lock breaking mechanism is overly simplified. - Cannot skip pre-racket dialogues. - Cannot modify cars. - Police does not care of you speeding. - It rains way too often. - Night and day cycle is poorly performed - dawns and sunsets nearly blind you. - I have not experienced any crashes or major bugs, bu there were plenty of small lags for the game of this level. - Same price as GTA-5... that is about as much they have in common.   Highs: + You can actually play stealthy or go full Rembo in most of the missions. + Stealth gameplay is interesting, but nothing even remotely close to Hitman series. + Main story missions (once they get unlocked) are exciting and fun. + Good game if you want to have a casual session. + Main characters are thought through. + Music selection is good. + Cut scene visuals are good - characters actually use their facial muscles. + Clear ending: you are not left wondering of what happens next.
13048	I would love to actually be able to play this game.  Sitting with a GTX 970 + i5 6500 and can't reach 60 FPS on Medium settings.   Yet, I can play Dishonored 2 perfectly fine, Battlefield 1 perfectly fine. I'd love to be able to play it if it works, as I loved the 2nd Mafia.
13049	*Game Start *Colored man gets betrayed by white southerner.. *Colored man gets revenge by murdering half of the southern mafia..  *Colored man kills person who betrayed him. *Game End  That's about it.. :| Game is bland, dosn't stand out too well as 'Edgy' or 'Great' Adding outfits to the game now is just a way to get more people in but the damage is done that a 'So-So' game was made with yet another fail YouTube Hype campagin.. You can pretty much just do everything with a silenced weapon and knife and get away with everything perfectly. Wish I can get a refund for believing yet another hype product.. God I feel dumb, don't make the same mistake I did.
13050	I was excited to buy this game because I absolutely loved Mafia 2. I was somewhat dissapointed that Mafia 3 did not meet the standard of it's predecessor.   Here are a few things that I liked and disliked.   Liked: - The game is enjoyable to play (if you do not compare it to Mafia 2)  - The physics in this game are alright and the shooting part is quite good.   Disliked: - It didn't meet the Mafia 2 standard.  - General interaction with people is louzy - The missions do not vary and repeat themself - No rich backstory - Cops basically ignore everything - Too easy - District conquering system the same as Saints Row - Main character is missing a personality - I didn't see the mafia part - You can't use stores but only rob them - Can't switch clothing or upgrade your weapon much  In a nutshell, this game dissapointed me massivly.  I wouldn't recommend it.  
13051	Boring as hell, dumb AI, weird animations, stupid enemies. All missions looks like the same Worst Mafia of all
13052	great start to the game, but went downhill really quickly. taking out enemies involves the same set of moves (distract and then stab) and all sub-bosses so far are virtually the same. Didn't bother to complete the game it got so boring. shame really.
13053	If you want a modern, scaled down version The Godfather ('06) filled to the rim with bugs, very mentally challenged npc's and a single mission on repeat. Then this game is for you!  Speaking of npc's, 'Patroling' cops, aka the 5 cops that are not stationary by the precinct are the worst of them all, they will literally only react if you point a gun at their face, or if you trigger a witness. So feel free to drive at 120mph on the sidewalk right past them, you got nothing to lose.  Also the 'attempt' to create an intriguing story is laughable.  The best part of the game is the soundtrack, shame that it feels like they only have 10 different songs altogether over the 3 stations.
13054	30 fps and 2012 graphics.
13055	won't start after the most recent patch, i even reinstalled it. still doen't work.. the game is pretty good apart from the glitches.. story is great same as the songs on the radio. the problem is that when you finised the story, there is not a lot to any more in the world. and i know it is not GTA but man i hope there will be a lot more to do in the future..
13056	I have now completed the game and overall it was alright. It could have actually be great if developers made more focus on the main quest line and would bother to polish the PC port.  Lows: - You need to complete majority of side missions to progress with the story. - No hesists or robberies, just kill-kill-kill. - All side missions are nearly identical: confront (kill or interrogate) someone or destroy stuff. - You get good weapons way too early in the game, meaning you stick with them to the end. - Lock breaking mechanism is overly simplified. - Cannot skip pre-racket dialogues. - Cannot modify cars. - Police does not care of you speeding. - It rains way too often. - Night and day cycle is poorly performed - dawns and sunsets nearly blind you. - I have not experienced any crashes or major bugs, bu there were plenty of small lags for the game of this level. - Same price as GTA-5... that is about as much they have in common.   Highs: + You can actually play stealthy or go full Rembo in most of the missions. + Stealth gameplay is interesting, but nothing even remotely close to Hitman series. + Main story missions (once they get unlocked) are exciting and fun. + Good game if you want to have a casual session. + Main characters are thought through. + Music selection is good. + Cut scene visuals are good - characters actually use their facial muscles. + Clear ending: you are not left wondering of what happens next.

13058	First of all I'am big Mafia I and II fan but this is the worst game I've played in years !!!! It's a SHAME !
13059	  Worst game released this year (DAT LUK GUD) wont recommend it to nobody..............  Im lucky i got it from when i bought my 1070
13060	This game had the potential to be great, and they failed. Don't get me wrong it is a good game but it is not worth 60 bucks its probably worth half of that. If the devs continue to support the game and add some small things to it, it could become ten times better just with customization or other systems in the game that require your attention. Without those small personality things the game feels super repetative. Even thought GTA 5 is repetative you would have a mission where something unique happens, and that just isnt the case here. The soundtrack is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing AWESOME though. Its essentially a gang killing simulator.   6/10
13061	In short: Just poorly made mix of GTA+Far Cry with almost identical side missions, boring repetative gameplay and without a single remarkable charismatic character.
13062	booring games ever, save your money dude.. !!
13063	Same complaint as with the first Assassin's Creed game, excellent concept ruined with the same mission over and over, it's repetetive and after driving clear across the map for the 20th time for a mission you've completed 39 times it gets boring pretty fast. Cover based shooting too easy, stealth assassinations too easy. Might be worth buying on sale for the story.
13064	 Verdict: You're having a laugh-ia III.   Just another open world check list objective game. Play for 2 hours and you'll realize the next forty or so will just be the same. -Interrogate someone then go to objective A and destroy/take/beat someone -Repeat on objective B -Kill a boss  Performance - I'm getting about 60-80 FPS with everything maxed. That's on a GTX1080 and i7 4790k 16GB RAM. The game is visually pretty bland, the textures aren't very detailed and there's a blurry quality to the whole game. For my playtime the lighting was broken and outside scenes would slightly lighten and darken at random. GTAV looked a lot better and ran better too, this game needs some patchwork before it's recommended.
13065	If this game came out under a different title i would recommend it. The fact that its so far away from even being close to the mafia 3 we all wanted it to be is what ruins it.  If you purchase this game not wanting a mafia game, but something totally different, then its a pretty decent game.   7/10 for overall rating 0/10 for mafia rating   RIP mafia series
13066	Wow. was really excited to play this game...until i played it. It has repetative tasks, its as if there are only 5 major jobs to do throughout the whole game with story missions here and there. AI is terrible, Story was just O.K... I would save your money and not buy this garbage. Super let down by all the hype. Stay away, not worth it.
13067	maybe good if thay finsh it  it is like 50% of a game
13068	Game doesn't run good even though my computer is over reccomended specs, game crash after 20 minutes, graphics aren't good for a 2016 game, FPS lock shouldn't be there in 2016. I want a performance patch ASAP 2K or I'm refunding just like everybody else
13069	Though story is good, there are way to many bugs and game feels really, really unfinished. Missions are also very repetitive. Would only by on a sale.
13070	How to know if you'll like this game:  1. Do you like repeating the same stuff 150+ times? 2. Do you appreciating the art of gaming?  If you chose option 1 you'll enjoy it. If you chose option 2 then good. Because this game is a repetitive pile of crap.
13071	Very blurry graphics. I have it maxed out with gtx 1080. Low framerate. Done buy until fixed.
13072	Not sure what to say, bit frustrated as it's crashed 3 times and lost my saves so have to go back to last mission - ok when it happens once, but 3 times is not fun.  Other than that the game seems good, nice graphics and sounds, the AI is a bit crap at times and when you have many enemies, thery showe up then they dont (when you do the scan mode)   I cannot recommend this game at the moment which is a shame as Mafia II was excellent :/   If they fix the crashes and AI then I will change my rating!  This feels like it was rushed out (like so many games these days)  A few days later and it's still crashing guys, and there is so many little bugs - see my screenshots - I have done many missions but the final objective is missing, its happened 3 times now  I have now asjed for help from 2K as the game shows things like objectives that are not yet ready to do, but the wording is still in the game, so you spend time looking for the object.  2K have responded and their reply is its my computers fault, and it maybe down to DirectX etc - laughable and useless reply!   I am still enjoying playing and the game is good, its just frustrating with the amount of bugs.  The music makes the game worth playing tbh, its got a great soundtrack on a few radio sdtations :)
13073	My computer runs all new games just fine, but this game (tried different graphics settings) comes with ridiculous mini-stutters while driving. This really kills the experience. I am hoping for a patch to solve this ... but no dev should release a game in such a state.
13074	I should have thrown my money out into the street. I would have gotten better satisfaction. Three times I started this game and three times it has crashed. The third time it started from the beginning. What is going on? This is no joke. People work hard for their money and deserve a better product.   The game is working well after the patch. Not finished yet but so far going good. Enjoying it   I just finished the boxing mission and the game crashed. I reset it and it crashed again it the same spot. Unbelievable
13075	Oh boy Mafia 3 is coming out im so excited it will be so good, trailers look good, first gameplays look amazing, AAA game what could go wrong. Well â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game is the most repetitive boring game I have ever played. We play the same â¥â¥â¥â¥ing mission from beginning to end in slightly new or sometimes even the same places. It is just not fun, the games only savior is the cutscenes and story which is awesome until your twenty hours in and realize why the â¥â¥â¥â¥ am i still playing. All i want is the story to be over so i can stop playing. Another fun point is the shooting and sometimes the graphics. They look good and killing is awesome. But it is just so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing boring i cant explain this to you anymore it is just sooooo â¥â¥â¥â¥ing boring, the only time i would recomend buying this kill simulator is for 15 dollars, that is when it isnt on sale. â¥â¥â¥â¥ you hanger 13 and â¥â¥â¥â¥ you 2k for ruining one of my favorite franchises.
13076	Pre-ordered it. I couldn't lunch it at the beginning and they said that they was gonna release an update to fix the issue. Have waited for over two months and they haven't fixed it yet.
13077	The game crashed within the first 30 minutes of gameplay, which is horrible for a AAA game like this, it should not have happened in the first place, not to mention that the game lock the frame rate at 30 fps, I thought game developers are well-acknowleged that they shouldn't lock fps on the pc, this happened in the past as well and act like this pisses a lot of people off. Finally the control is all over the place(I play the game with controller for better experience since mouse and keyboard on this game is horrible), the button placement is not optimized for most people and it takes a long time to get use to. 6/10. Expected more from a game hyped for so long, gotta not recommend this game until everything get patched.

Not finished yet but so far going good. Enjoying it   I just finished the boxing mission and the game crashed. I reset it and it crashed again it the same spot. Unbelievable
13079	I don't reccomend this game at all and here's why:    The first two hours of the game is basically a tutorial teaching you how it works and the first full mission, so by the time you realize you don't want the game anymore it's too late to get a refund    If you like the first full mission then your gonna like this game just as much because the whole thing is a copy and paste of that mission    There's nothing extra like changing clothes, haircut, etc. so you can't do anything other than copy paste missions    I couldn't continue playing because I had to see what else there is to the game so after doing some research I found that it's the same thing 36 times (thanks to angry joe doing the math)    Even if there weren't the uncountable amount of bugs in this game it still doesn't feel finished     Even bigger of a disappointment than watch dogs because at least watch dogs had some variety in the things you can do and at the least different colored outfits    There is absolutely nothing other than guns and ammo to spend your money on, making money almost worthless since there isn't anything actually cool to buy    But you don't actually even have to buy weapons as every mission I have played has been beat using weapons I find on the ground  I'm â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ that I'm unable to get a refund because by the time I realized that this game was â¥â¥â¥â¥ and actually hurts to play through because of how repetetive it gets, it was already 9 hours because like I said earlier the first two hours isn't an accurate representation of how the game really is. I had more fun in the tutorial than in the real game, but even looking past the dullness of this game you still get a buggy, unfinished, early access game. The positives of this game are that:    It looks pretty good    The first mission is strong    The story was good (until you start getting tired of the game and feel no motivation to continue)  I honestly can't think of any other positives that I would include in this game. EDIT: I ALSO HAVE NO BIAS AS I HAVE NEVER PLAYED PREVIOUS MAFIA GAMES
13080	Muddy texures at max settings and 30fps cap. Good gameplay but I can't stomache the performance issues will wait until they fix it.... if they do.
13081	i just brought this and for some god reason its crashing everytime when im starting up. wow game well played.
13082	Repetative game, lush world with good story and cutscenes, but mundane action and little else.  Missed opertunity to use the open world they created in a more filling way.  An avarage game wait for patches and content pick up on sale.
13083	60's Vehicle driving simulator   In all honesty though, The game is really poor. It starts great with an interesting story and mission. Once you get to a certain point and have to conquer districts you will see yourself going round in circles for the next 20 hours. Without a great storyline which I've been used to in the last Mafia games.  Would rate it 3 out of 10

13087	I have a beast of a PC so for me the game works and look brilliant.... but this isnt mafia... everything that was mafia has been removed and painted over with the same crap in every other free roam peice of â¥â¥â¥â¥ in the last ten years.   im dissapointed
13088	Same mission over and over :( Mafia 2 was my favourite game... It was gripping the whole way through. Tbh, I'm bored of this already, and seeing as I know how it ends, I can't even be â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ to finish it
13089	I was so hyped for this game but playing it all it seems to do is stutter. This is game breaking.
13090	  got this game for free with my motherboard, I played it for 2 hours, feel like I wasted my time, the game is pretty bad, the story is decent, but to get to the story missions you need to play this substandart game, so watch on youtube cutscene movie, dont buy the game, just saved u like 20-25 bucks, you should say thank you. the controls are weird and uncomfortable and you will find your self scracthing your head searching for the right key. the graphics are also kinda weird as the game loads so much â¥â¥â¥â¥ you dont need that a gtx 1070 has hard time with this on 1080p. the only good thing about this game is the story litterally, just dont buy this game, watch youtube cutscene movie plz. I got this game for free and I feel like I got robbed.
13091	The game is locked on 30 FPS, fix it fast.
13092	  If you enjoy repeating the same missions through the entire game, then this is for you. You are going to be literally repeating the same mission until the end, this is not a joke
13093	Mafia IIIâ¦where to beginâ¦  Letâs begin with Mafia and Mafia IIâ¦both great games.   Mafia was a masterpiece of storytelling and world creationâ¦atmosphere and player involvement. It was different. It was Mafia!  Mafia II was pretty darned goodâ¦hard to follow such a striking first game but did pretty well IMO; equally good story telling, characters and setting. Thoroughly enjoyable and immersive! Who can forget driving a drunken Joe and Eddie home from burying a corpse with Dean singing Return to Me on the radio and everyone singing along!  If I had a complaint with Mafia II it was that such a great world was pretty sterile off the beaten trackâ¦could have done with more to doâ¦more interactionâ¦more hidden missions if you entered a shop or abandoned buildingâ¦just a bit more imagination in creating a bit more non linear entertainment. Lots of people commented this.   So!... easy peasy lemon squeezy right? Mafia 3â¦ you set it in Vegas in the 60s or something like thatâ¦continue the great Mafia themeâ¦ the guns, the fast cars, the loose women, the story driven immersive gameplay and add a bit more non-linear content a bit more exploration. You maintain the car customization, the choice of clothesâ¦the musicâ¦ you addâ¦.you add a bit moreâ¦you make a classicâ¦  Well, noâ¦you hand the franchise off and say âkill it!â  The devs cut all the customizationâ¦all the clothesâ¦any hope of exploration. You create a huge sterile world and fill it withâ¦dun dun dun! A quest for fuses! You cut the Mafia down to supporting actorâ¦you make the starâ¦ racism!â¦yeah! Political correctness front and bloody centreâ¦YAWN! If I see one more review praising this dirge for âtackling issuesâ Iâm gonna puke. It doesnât even work at doing this by the way. The eponymous hero of our PC tale is only half AA and runs around being handled by a white guy and ends up well entrenched in just the sort of stereotypical lifestyle that youâd have aspirations to avoid coming from a minority background.  The point is you donât make a Mafia game about something other than the Mafia! Itâs not bigâ¦itâs not clever itâs not surprisingâ¦itâs just pants!  No real story telling here eitherâ¦Cut scenes are not story telling! Cut scenes are not a substitute for gameplay! If it needs narration then it has failed to tell the story...this is true of all cinema and all gameplay. In Mafia and Mafia IIâ¦you were the storyâ¦you were the evolutionâ¦you lived it you played it. Here you watch the story as itâs handed out to you and then you play the gapsâ¦terrible!  OMG! The repetition! I have finished the game and I can honestly say itâs 50 hours of rinse and repeat the same couple of missions over and over and over and over andâ¦  Even the Playboy collection is repeated in good part from Mafia IIâ¦the same girls!! Did they think we wouldnât notice?!!  Graphics are hardly better than Mafia II!â¦textures are from ages past. Iâm a firm believer in story first and graphics later. I could forgive the view in the rear view mirror if I was living the Mafia lifeâ¦but it just appals when you arenâtâ¦   I wonât even go near the 30fps cap at launchâ¦I canâtâ¦ I choke up and want to eviscerate my console buying friendsâ¦  Couple of patches later and things have improved somewhatâ¦but even a Titan X (Maxwell) clocked at 1400MHz just runs 60fps at 1440p max settingsâ¦.could this be the new Crysisâ¦just without the visuals or story?  In summaryâ¦this would have been a good 20 hour game if it was called âbored on the bayouâ.  Good points?...I guess the music is still good and some of the gunplay reminds you of Mafia.  Who does this to a game? How does this happen? Itâs so obvious how this should have moved forward itâs hard not to wonder at the mental acuity of Hangar 13 or the lack of s**ts given at 2K over the legacy of the first two chapters of this seriesâ¦  *Sigh*  Buy on sale when itâs seriously fallen in priceâ¦
13094	Very very poor performing game! I am so sick of AAA titles being reliesed in this sort of state. I had waited for the patch so that I could run at a more acceptable frame rate nut now I cant even get 15fps!!  I am running on a GTX 970 SLI configuration and have tried disabling one of the cards but no difference.  I was so looking forward to this game but now....its not worth the hard drive space!   Gutted.  I purchased Mafia 3 via a steam code purchased from a store. This means I cannot get a refund!  
13095	This game is grabage! This isn't even a video game, its a movie! Ten minutes of cut-scenes, followed by 2 minutes of gameplay, rinse and repeat. I have played... Watched this game/movie for 1.2 hours now and I have spend the better hour watching cut-scenes and 20 mins playing the game.   The story is also terrible! It starts of with loads of people talking about this guy linkin clay, then after 15 minutes of cut-scenes, I am then suddenly driving a truck to a bank. I am then robbing the bank then suddenly, I'm driving a guy to a bar to get drunk, I then wake up, feed the homeless, then I'm shooting poor people who live in a swamp. Seriously, this game jumps from one scene to another, like a 12 year old child who has A.D.D. The rest of them clearly seperates black people from white people, it tries to make a statment that white people are evil. Yet all I see in the game is black people commiting crime in a white suburban area, black people killing people of all colours and nationalities, but somehow white people are bad because they use the 'N' word, even though black people are murdering and killing countless people. Double standard, social justice warrior crap to the MAX!  Gamplay is bad. 30 FPS is horrible, its like a blurry GTA game, were your car feels like a supercharged hotrod, with the stopping power of a mac truck hauling a ton of goods. The AI is also bad. In some instances the AI won't respond even when they spot you, while at other times they will spot you through a wall. The rest of the game is very blurry over all and very hard to see where you are going unless its night time.   I wouldn't buy this trash heep of a game. Its that one in the series that destoryed the rest of the series, like what Terminator 3 did to T1 and T2. Save your money, forget this game.
13096	cant even run the game.crashes right after the game shows hanger 13 logo.  this is unexeptable in 2016. should have cancelled my preorder. gonna try to get a refund from my retailer.
13097	Has massive Audio issues when it comes to soundblaster cards. Annoying crackle like spark sound once every seck- 2 seck's Very annoying and ruins entire game feel.   This game should go back to testing before market for sure. SOOO many issues in this â¥â¥â¥â¥ that is totaly not worth the money. Download and enjoy the story there instead. they screwd ppl over in this mafia game.
13098	Locked at 30fps. Graphics and textures WELL BELOW PAR for 2016. Just look at a wall or the floor in the game. Compare to Witcher 3, GTA V etc...awful.   Feels stuttery.  Good: Shooting decent, driving fun, story excellent and pacing good.   Can't recommend due to technical issues.
13099	!!!SOME MINOR SPOILERS ALERT!!!  Well, this is how it starts: Lincoln Clay returns from Vietnam, gets back to his family. He helps his father (not real one) to deal with his problems, kills some Haitians, robs a bank for local mafia boss. Then mafia boss kills Lincoln's father and (brother?) with hands of your heist crew members. All these missions are great, you feel that Mafia atmosphere around, lots of details, really good cutscenes and acting. You feel attached to characters. This is great intro, not cliche bullsh*t with revenge for characters you met 5 minutes ago and dont even remember their names. You play this intro for hour or so, but then you realise this was just an intro to the actual game, and the game itself should be even better, right?  Actual game turns out to be cheap grinding openworld sh*t. I realised that when i captured 3rd district in town, and my actions were all the same: 1. You come to guy who can help you to capture district. 2. He tells you where to find a snitch, who you can interrogate. 3. Snitch tells you locations of places you can hit to damage property of local district boss. 4. You come to this places and kill everyone/destroy something. (By the way, interrogation missions are the same as this step). 5. Repeat step 4 until boss of the property comes out, and kill him. Yeah, and boss comes out in a same place you have trashed already, so you have to trash it again. I did 3 districts, no exceptions for that. And yes, you do this step same way as step 4 again.  So after 3 districts I have 6 more to go and I realised that the game is already boring and repetitive. I still dont understand how from these beautiful intro missions game instantly turned into grinding piece of sh*t. You basically do one mission with little variations over and over again and even story missions between this district grinding (which are killings of the district bosses) are pretty much the same.   I knew, that the game will be openworlded, and I know what to expect from this kind of games. I like Shadow of Mordor and Batman: Arkham Something series, and i thought Mafia 3 will be same solid openworld expirience, where you do same things but it is not boring because realization of game mechanics is really good.  Game mechanics in Mafia 3 are not good. The game has dumbest AI I saw in years. Stealth mechanics are pure trash (thanks a lot to AI). You can run around stealthy in crowded place, killing guards one by one scaring the f*ck out of civilians, yet their screams and panic will not alert nearby guards at all. To kill everyone stealthy you need only 2 buttons: D-Pad Left (whistle) and B (takedown). You stand behind cover luring brainless enemies right in your hands and kill them without any trouble. Shooting in this game feels good, but AI is still dumb so they like to leave cover and run to their deaths. I've been playing on Hard difficulty, and i had problems in shootouts only when there were really a lot of enemies. They run to you from different directions, throw molotovs and can kill you in 3-4 hits on Hard, but if their number is less than 6, they are doomed. And yes, I play with a gamepad, so if you play with KB&amp;M you can multiply this number by 10.  And few words about graphics. Lets compare it to GTA. Mafia always had better graphics than GTA of same (+-2) release year. It looked really mature in comparison with 'casual' and not serious GTA. Mafia had a lot of highly detailed interiors, 'movie-like' characters and animation. Mafia 3 looks... meh. Nice enough, but meh. GTA 5 that released 2.5 years ago still looks way better, more detailed and has more fps on max settings (I have i5-3570K, GTX 1070, 16 GB RAM and 2560x1440p monitor). The only graphics part that feels like real step forward is cutscenes. They were great in previous Mafias but in this one they are even better. And you've probably seen videos like Mafia 3 vs Mafia 1 where you see how every little detail that worked in Mafia 1 doesnt exist in Mafia 3, so I will not talk about it in detail.  So, my final rating is 5/10. If you remove title Mafia 3 and Vito from the game you will not find anything remotely close to previous Mafia games. I will continue playing and if by some miracle game will return to missions like in intro, I will be really happy. But I doubt this will happen, and it would be really frustrating anyway to dig through this sh*t missions to play some golden ones. And sorry for my bad english, btw.

13101	cant even run the game.crashes right after the game shows hanger 13 logo.  this is unexeptable in 2016. should have cancelled my preorder. gonna try to get a refund from my retailer.
13102	!!!SOME MINOR SPOILERS ALERT!!!  Well, this is how it starts: Lincoln Clay returns from Vietnam, gets back to his family. He helps his father (not real one) to deal with his problems, kills some Haitians, robs a bank for local mafia boss. Then mafia boss kills Lincoln's father and (brother?) with hands of your heist crew members. All these missions are great, you feel that Mafia atmosphere around, lots of details, really good cutscenes and acting. You feel attached to characters. This is great intro, not cliche bullsh*t with revenge for characters you met 5 minutes ago and dont even remember their names. You play this intro for hour or so, but then you realise this was just an intro to the actual game, and the game itself should be even better, right?  Actual game turns out to be cheap grinding openworld sh*t. I realised that when i captured 3rd district in town, and my actions were all the same: 1. You come to guy who can help you to capture district. 2. He tells you where to find a snitch, who you can interrogate. 3. Snitch tells you locations of places you can hit to damage property of local district boss. 4. You come to this places and kill everyone/destroy something. (By the way, interrogation missions are the same as this step). 5. Repeat step 4 until boss of the property comes out, and kill him. Yeah, and boss comes out in a same place you have trashed already, so you have to trash it again. I did 3 districts, no exceptions for that. And yes, you do this step same way as step 4 again.  So after 3 districts I have 6 more to go and I realised that the game is already boring and repetitive. I still dont understand how from these beautiful intro missions game instantly turned into grinding piece of sh*t. You basically do one mission with little variations over and over again and even story missions between this district grinding (which are killings of the district bosses) are pretty much the same.   I knew, that the game will be openworlded, and I know what to expect from this kind of games. I like Shadow of Mordor and Batman: Arkham Something series, and i thought Mafia 3 will be same solid openworld expirience, where you do same things but it is not boring because realization of game mechanics is really good.  Game mechanics in Mafia 3 are not good. The game has dumbest AI I saw in years. Stealth mechanics are pure trash (thanks a lot to AI). You can run around stealthy in crowded place, killing guards one by one scaring the f*ck out of civilians, yet their screams and panic will not alert nearby guards at all. To kill everyone stealthy you need only 2 buttons: D-Pad Left (whistle) and B (takedown). You stand behind cover luring brainless enemies right in your hands and kill them without any trouble. Shooting in this game feels good, but AI is still dumb so they like to leave cover and run to their deaths. I've been playing on Hard difficulty, and i had problems in shootouts only when there were really a lot of enemies. They run to you from different directions, throw molotovs and can kill you in 3-4 hits on Hard, but if their number is less than 6, they are doomed. And yes, I play with a gamepad, so if you play with KB&amp;M you can multiply this number by 10.  And few words about graphics. Lets compare it to GTA. Mafia always had better graphics than GTA of same (+-2) release year. It looked really mature in comparison with 'casual' and not serious GTA. Mafia had a lot of highly detailed interiors, 'movie-like' characters and animation. Mafia 3 looks... meh. Nice enough, but meh. GTA 5 that released 2.5 years ago still looks way better, more detailed and has more fps on max settings (I have i5-3570K, GTX 1070, 16 GB RAM and 2560x1440p monitor). The only graphics part that feels like real step forward is cutscenes. They were great in previous Mafias but in this one they are even better. And you've probably seen videos like Mafia 3 vs Mafia 1 where you see how every little detail that worked in Mafia 1 doesnt exist in Mafia 3, so I will not talk about it in detail.  So, my final rating is 5/10. If you remove title Mafia 3 and Vito from the game you will not find anything remotely close to previous Mafia games. I will continue playing and if by some miracle game will return to missions like in intro, I will be really happy. But I doubt this will happen, and it would be really frustrating anyway to dig through this sh*t missions to play some golden ones. And sorry for my bad english, btw.
13103	When can i â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ costum lincoln? â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ useless rabbish ppl....
13104	A bad port wasn't part of the deal
13105	The Graphics on the game I have to say, At the moment sucks. Real bad! I see alot of talk about it, However I try to give a chance. I preodor it anyways. I hate to say it but its bad! The wourst Ive seen in a new release in a long time. I beleave they will fix it so I want ask for a refund, But what a bad start.. I was so looking forward to this game to. What a let down.
13106	f*ck you 2K , 30fps
13107	This game is pathetic!!! DO NOT BUY!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!  Mafia II &gt; Mafia I &gt; Mafia III  I think that sums it up!!!
13108	Very very poor performing game! I am so sick of AAA titles being reliesed in this sort of state. I had waited for the patch so that I could run at a more acceptable frame rate nut now I cant even get 15fps!!  I am running on a GTX 970 SLI configuration and have tried disabling one of the cards but no difference.  I was so looking forward to this game but now....its not worth the hard drive space!   Gutted.  I purchased Mafia 3 via a steam code purchased from a store. This means I cannot get a refund!  
13109	Locked at 30fps. Graphics and textures WELL BELOW PAR for 2016. Just look at a wall or the floor in the game. Compare to Witcher 3, GTA V etc...awful.   Feels stuttery.  Good: Shooting decent, driving fun, story excellent and pacing good.   Can't recommend due to technical issues.
13110	Has massive Audio issues when it comes to soundblaster cards. Annoying crackle like spark sound once every seck- 2 seck's Very annoying and ruins entire game feel.   This game should go back to testing before market for sure. SOOO many issues in this â¥â¥â¥â¥ that is totaly not worth the money. Download and enjoy the story there instead. they screwd ppl over in this mafia game.
13111	RX 480 NITRO+ OC 8GB   ultra preset ~35 fps with drops to 23  high preset ~35 fps with drops to 23 medium preset ~35 fps with drops to 23 low preset ~35 fps with drops to 23  Worst optimization of the decade? 
13112	This is an incomplete game with too many flaws to give a good recommendation.  Pros: Cuts scenes are well directed and have great voice acting and graphics. Overall story is very interesting and engaging.  Cons: Game is unfinished. I've fallen through the map numerous times. Graphics in between cut scenes are very poor (playstation 2 quality) Game crashes a lot during loading screens.
13113	mafia 2 is better
13114	I guess they released a beta-version of a console port. Runs bad and looks bad. Don't buy this game at this stage.
13115	I bought the game Friday &amp; today (sunday) I decided to give it a go. What a farce the first thing I noticed was that as the game launches the backlighting on my keyboard &amp; mouse turns off. I plugged in my orbweaver after 20 minutes fapping round rebooting and that time the keyboard lights went off but the orby and the backlights on my mouse stayed on. I never had this hassle with any other game before. Anyway after I got into the game for a bit the keyboard lit up in some weird color but better than notheing so I disconnected orby. Keyboard lights work intermittently altho mouse lights now seem OK. Then got into a loop in the tutorial whereby map opened then when that closed went bak to tutorial screen again no way out back &amp; forward btween the screens but no game. Eventually fixed that by connecting up 360 controller - again after much fapping around. Then I got about 15 minutes of gaming (most of which was watching cutscenes - yuk) before big crash to desktop during firefight. What? restart n go thru it all again. This game should never have been shipped in this alpha state there are just too many bugs in it. I played all mafia games (1&amp;2) with KB &amp; M plus all GTA plus the great 'sleeping dogs', none of them required musical controllers which breaks immersion and makes the game a drag.
13116	'family is not who you are born with, but who you die for' is much more true for mafia II than for this poor game that is here to profit of the 'mafia' title
13117	Looks and plays like old console port.   I just played Mafia 2 right through and was ready to go back to back ith this crap. Mafia 2 puts this to shame in every way.  Result = I Refunded it along with the season pass.   I'm sick of the AAA not fit for PC @ launch remember deus ex Mankind must be deluded.  Thank you steam for refund option.  Vote with your wallet people.
13118	Truly a Mafia game, I've been robbed of 50â¬ - game won't even start. Dont buy the game, go to a pub and have a pint, you and your money will be far better off there.
13119	PLEASE DELETE THIS GAME AND RERELEASE WHEN U FIX IT
13120	DO NOT BUY THE GAME. I have just filmed a graphics glith that happens very often. The game is poorly optimizes and has low graphics.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OVaUDBsbrwA 
13121	worst mafia game 
13122	Give Me A Cab, Give U A Thumb.
13123	Been playing despite the 30FPS cap. Really cool game bogged down by the technical incompetence/awful port. If they fix the 21:9 menus, remove the cap and improve the AI a little bit, I'll change my thumbs down to a thumbs up.
13124	It was terible, refunded it.  AI behaved like a 1980's game when attacking you, basically just stood there till i killed them.  Graphics are poor for 2016, story and cut scenes are bloody great but again the gameplay is wank. I had 6 enemies coming at me, i used 6 bullets to headshot everyone of them, I just stood there taking my time, they just stood there shooting ala wolfenstien 1980's style, being hit didnt even move my aim point or make my character flinch. Utter balls, game felt like it was make for incompetent gamers.  Truth is its a GTA wannabe and fails miserably, Mafia will never be GTA, it was never meant to be GTA, STOP TRYING TO MAKE IT GTA!!  Yet another established game name, killed by sequels.  2/10
13125	Do not reccommend this game at all.  The 30fps cap, while being patched, should not have been in the game upon release. That's just telling us they're rushing out an unfinished product. On top of that the combat just feels completely bland. Its no different than what you'd find out of any mediocre 3rd person shooter and lacks any real complexity.  Comparing this to Mafia 2, they did everything wrong right from the start. The start should have been Lincoln in Vietnam as a tutorial (similar to Vito in WW2 in Mafia 2). Instead you just get a boring drive to a ~30 second shootout.  I had good expectations for this game coming from Mafia 2, but its just very disappointing to me.
13126	Gaming industry nowadays..i can't..i don't know what to say, i'm so dissapointed .. WHY IS SO F****** HARD TO RUN SOME TESTS BEFORE LAUNCHING A GAME? I really don't understand especially if this is your first game..why not making a good impression from the beginning?  For now i say no , very poorly optimised.
13127	After the patch the framerate is higher, but that doesn't get me far when the game suddenly freezes so bad I have to reboot my PC. Great job, devs! How about releasing a finished product from time to time?
13128	Pros: - Will write it once the game is actually playable.  Cons: - 30 FPS lock. What year is this? - Lack of Steam controller support. The game is completely unplayable with a Steam controller since the controller presets are not loaded for some reason, you'll have to bind everything to keyboard buttons. Walking around with the stick and setting the setting the right touchpad to Mouse also won't work, since the character will stop walking every time you move the camera. Same goes for aiming with right trigger and mouse.  In hindsight, it has taught me an important lesson: Do not ever preorder. Ever. 'But it's a major title and it can't go wrong!' Nope, it still can.
13129	yaya blah blah, i just played a couple of minutes BUT no, just no!  don't buy this game at the actual state.  it's another lazy â¥â¥â¥ console port - the keybindings r a joke. u can't change the language after starting a new game, so decide well. (erm, ma bad, u can. just go to default settings in the audio tab and than u can change it) stupid anyway.   some ppl say the 30 fps lock is not that bad - it is THAT bad! it's not a dark world full of crime - it is a blurry world full of blur to hide the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ textures. if u wanna laugh, look at the textures the game is offering. im sure this should have been a xbox 360 game years ago. don't get me wrong, graphics r not everything and the game looks okey, but why the heck does it run like a big pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥?!   maybe this is the new scheme to develop games now days, or maybe pc gamers are just not worth it to get a playable FULL PRICE game...  look at starbreeze, or klei for example - dev teams with just a handfull of ppl, but they give us awesome games! games made with love.  anyway, i can't play mafia 3 at this state and im ashamed to support these lazy punks with their â¥â¥â¥ full of money, alot of ppl and what we r getting? â¥â¥â¥â¥  update: 2 crashes after 1 hour and at the same place.  u want to know some positives about the game? alright; storytelling seems to be really good so far and also the game mechanics feel well done.   i really hope the game is enjoyable after the upcomming patch, cause mafia 3 seems to have a good amount of potential.
13130	At its current state I cannot recommend it. 30 fps as told from developers the day before launch 2016 is an absolute disgrace. Sloppy menus, not much settings, and hard to configure due to bugs. Crashes, in game bugs. Story? I dont know. After barely 25min my mind was sickened from the 'lagging' experience of 30 fps. Whiny? Yes. The mediocre resolution I can deal with, the 30 fps not. Patch in the weekend some say that fixes 30fps. Too little too late I say. Should have been included from the start. Yet another game not finished at launch. Refunded for me. Unfortunately...
13131	Slow in the head developers launch PC title with a 30fps cap and expect a good Steam review. *SIGH* Then they release condescending statement about taking their PC players seriously. Like they didnt have enough time to sort this â¥â¥â¥â¥ out before release. Well played 2k, well played.
13132	Had problems before I even started, black screen and game did not start.  After 45 min playing with 30 fps and crap lag the game crashes!
13133	Mafia Creed 3   What a â¥â¥â¥â¥ game, Mafia 2 is way better
13134	1. 30fps locked 2. Everything is blurry except Lincon himself 3. Game randomly crashes  Seriously? I just bought Mafia 2 for the last few weekends and felt quite disappointed about it. And now this?
13135	Can't get past the tutorial level. Found it wierd that I couldn't 'melee' the first tied up person I found and I couldn't pick up the body of the other 'whacked' guard when the game just starts.   I figured it was meant to be like that so you were force to actually continue playing the game/story instead of fooling around.  Stuck at the furnace. Can't preform a 'silent takedown' because for some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ reason my controls don't work. Binding them to custom keys or going back to 'vanilla' settings... it doesn't matter. Can't whack the guard.  Not even when plugging in a controller. And I understand that Dualshock 4 controllers might not be fully supported but I'm using software make it work. It works with every other (newly) released game at launch apart this one. Can't see the keybindings and not a single button on my controller does the 'silent takedown'.  And let's not forget the things this game does horribly wrong: rather limited graphical options. Only being able to turn off/or on the 'blur'. A little bit wouldn't mind but putting it on means having completely washed out graphics. FPS locked to 30 and I already notice how terrible it is having to play this on a locked 30 FPS. Specifically chose the PC version because of the previous games being on PC and just having the most 'freedom' to run and tweak the game to your preferences.  Fix the damn game. I'm pretty sure I'd enjoy this if I could properly play it.  1/10 terrible launch 2K/Hangar 13. It seems like you didn't even bother testing.
13136	I Do NOT recommend Mafia 3 !!  They removed so many good functions of mafia 2 !  Why no unique car upgrades ? Why lifetime weapons ? No unique missions after the intro ! Feels like always the same ! So repetitiv..-.- Didnt got any speeding ticket jet. after i passed cops with over 90mph ! Car Damagemodels suck ! No refueling the car ! No washing the car ! Nothing is customizable ! Cant change clothes. ! YOU Only kill .. damge.. and conquer the city... so dumb â¥â¥â¥â¥... DONT BUY !!  The game could be way better with just a little bit of polishing and changing some stuff...  and the worst ...  Crashes without any error messages.... and fps were locked to 30 at relese !!   IÂ´m so dissapointed....:(
13137	They are not taken pc player seriously.
13138	thats my second view of this game, and still disappointed about this â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game. The frame rate was unlocked. However gtx970 cant even stable at 60 fps for medium graphic setting, wtf??? and even the graphic looks like â¥â¥â¥â¥?? I can play GTAV for high graphic stable at 60 fps, and those graphic much better than this game. Omg, thats the most unfrendly optimisation geme in this year. i rather playing mafia 2 instead... ::((( (sorry my bad eng)  Furthermore, Maifa 3 has 16.7G for audio file, 10G for CG, so it only has less than 15G for actual gaming content?? well done 2K:)
13139	Starts of with a decent story, great music, great cutscene graphics - but falls completly flat on its stomach after a few hours.  * It's repetitive as â¥â¥â¥â¥ (36 times the same mission) * The story goes from intresting to unrelatable psycho masskilling in no time. * AI is generally â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, blind and not up to the task * Aiming with 2-handed weapons, is way off. (no, really) * The same in-game animations are used, over and again. * Badly optimized - can hardly get over 30 fps with 2x970 SLI * Speaking of 30 fps.. That FPS lock at launch was â¥â¥â¥â¥ing unacceptable!   The game had potential, it really did. It even starts out great, you really feel pumped - but when the first hour is through, you start to see the cracks in the painting - the repetitiveness, the random cutscene stories from people you never meet or have any relations to, the people you genuinly cared about are gone - and left are some uninteresting charachters and plothole that grows gets deeper by the minute.  I'll show myself out, i just wish i could have asked for a refund and not supported this mess.
13140	what is this ? 30 fps â¥â¥â¥â¥  in 2016 30 fps on pc Â´? cheap console port  
13141	Soundtrack is good, story is ok, graphics are very glitchy and it tends to crash a lot for some users, and really awful AI (You can kill 30 npc's and not one thing is done, Hell, you can use cars and bodies to stop a whole city dead in it's tracks! lol).  Also has a message about racism, NI &amp; Prod hatred and some issues with communism it appears... go figure... apart from all that it can be fun, be it very short fun. (If you don't crash out to desktop, or get bored repeating the same type of missions over &amp; over).  Characters are very forgettable and the world isn't interactable in any way, you can shoot bottles off tables etc. but you can't use a phone, WC, radio, eat, drink, change clothes, fix/modify cars etc.  4/10 - Music 2, Story 2.   Buy it next Easter on the Steam sale for Â£5, it sure isn't worth the Â£40 I paid.
13142	Following a doctors appointment and having my glasses checked by my optician i can only conclude there is nothing wrong with either my sight or my glasses. Therefore i can only conclude that the game looks like s***. I did some settings tweaking and upscaled the rendering, but this only helped a little. The game still looks blurry and the textures look like they received a photoshop smudging treatment. The combat felt stale and un-immersive. I drove on normal and simulated, but this also felt a little off. Before buying this game i did read up on it, after serverely lowering my expectations i was still left unsatisfied. If you want to play a good Mafia game, with good graphics, go buy Mafia II.
13143	This game has a great story and a great depiction of the 1960s that being said the game feels empty outside of the main story it feels like there is a lot of the imersive features that are missing from mafia 2 ( fuel consumption , garage customization , being able to purchase goods and services, fast travel ) alot of what made mafia 2 so fun to play.  there are also graphic issues at times textures look muddy and are not at all what you expect from a AAA title made in 2016 the sky and clouds often looking liek it was from a retextured n64 art style.   despite all that i do enjoy the story but often felt myself pulled out of the immersion of the game due to the repetativeness of objectives or quests and repetative combat style with the Ai and main character.
13144	Not recommended.  Poorly optimisied. Very blurry and stutters constantly.   Save your money and buy something. Don't just take my word for it, look at the thousands of other negative reviews.  Its shocking at this day and age a gaming company can get away with releasing something of this standard.  Massively disappointed as I really enjoyed Mafia 1 &amp; 2.
13145	Terrible, the graphics, the fps lock, the ai is dumb, everything is so damn blurry it looks like play-doh the game just feels like its a beta release to be honest. im refunding.
13146	A dissapointing refund, with amazing cutscenes, and a whole lot of missed potential...
13147	As is I can Not recommend this game to anyone. The fact that i can't keep any kind of steady framerate with my Gtx 970 and i5 4690 even on low settings is embarassing. The game does not have the kind of graphics to need such a powerful pc I can play most games on full settings at 1080p but this game isn't possible to play on full settings unless you have a 20 core processor and a Titan X and even then it probably wouldn't get a steady framerate. Overall the game is an endless loop of the same mission but I can forgive that because the story and gameplay is actually quite fun the stealth works but the AI is totally stupid making it a little too easy.. I would really like to play this game all the way through but in it's current state i'm afraid i can't without severe frustration and agonizing slowdowns I'd say it equivelant to playing a poorly emulated ps2 game  TO 2K or HANGER 13 : OPTIMIZE THIS GAME  Revision - Got the game running stable thanks to a very helpful post that i can't find now but it was basically going into my nvidia control panel and changing the antrioscopic filtering to 8x works good now def playable
13148	Wouldn't even run I got a refund and am getting Mafia 2 instead, wait for a patch and get in the Christmas sales if your thinking about buying.
13149	-repetitive gameplay (maybe 5 out of the several dozen missions aren't) game literally feels like a proof of concept, really tired of these 'speed bump' grind open world games and miss the good ol' days of linear action/adventure based PC titles. -No difficulty progression, the end is just about as hard as the beginning, the funny thing is that the hardest part of the game is the random generated events when Marcano's hitman try to get you. If you are going to make a game that has grinding as a element at least make it so I am grinding towards being able to finish the story, not becoming more invincible. -dumb AI that is most effectively dealt with playing the game stealth, setting the game harder doesn't help, a hail of gunfire from a covered enemy will take you down to the brink of death just making the game more frustrating. Also can AI see through walls? -muddy sub-HD upscaled graphics similar to Quantum Break. -pop in/dithering of objects and textures. -shouldn't take GTX 1080 to run this game smoothly, no effort put into the PC version, feels like a straight port from the Xbox one with remapped controls. -crashing into everything, even bushes, same exagerated crash animation even at low speed. -cant even get out of water at shore. -100 some songs but only 3 radio stations, I feel like I hear the same 3 advertisements and songs over and over again. -poor GPS navigation and a hundred other random small bugs that definately don't belong in a triple A title. -developer provided a 60fps patch pretty quick but were really late to inform everyone about this red flag which would of cancled my pre-order, therefore you get a negative review.  +pretty decent story even though its kind of ridiculous and preachy at times, if you are playing this seriosuly just skip every side mission and just get to the objective as soon as possible you're not missing anything. +loot that is actually interesting, playboy and vargas tasteful nudes.
13150	The Game does not run very well, consistently low FPS (under 30) on a machine that can run other, more demanding games above 60 no problem. Screen tearing is a very slight issue. Performance when on foot isnt too bad but when driving it is awful. Twice the game has crashed from looking back whilst driving at speed.  In terms of mechanics, the driving to me feels worse than Mafia 2, feels more like driving a boat than a car, very swimmy, lots of roll on the cars, lots of wheelspin, braking is ineffective and vehicles just seem to lurch about. Gunplay has been improved, weapons feel heavier and there is more variety and now upgradability to them. However unlike in Mafia 2 you are limited to only 2 at a time, a primary and a sidearm.  My biggest gripe with the game is the lack of veriety in the missions, it's the same thing over and over again until you take control of an area of the city, then you just go and take over another area. It feels like a grind. Compare this to Mafia 2 where every mission was different. Yes, some were better than others but they all had something unique and memorable about them. If I ever get round to finishing Mafia 3 I don't see myself ever wanting to go back and do it again, but I still play Mafia 2 to this day.  On the plus side, the soundtrack is very good.
13151	whole game is pants. so glitchy im stuck on level 2 and cant progress because of a cut scene that will not appear
13152	I have a really nice RIG and I can only run this game on low settings smoothly.. This game is poorly optimized.. I can run GTA 5 on ULTRA with no real issue at all and this game.. not even close.  As for the game its fun and the story is there. Great characters, environment, music and gameplay but I see how the game  is repetative.   My specs.  Geforce GTX 970 driver version 373.06 Intel i7-6700k Skylake 4.00 GHz 31.91 RAM 2560x1440 59Hz ASUS Maximus Hero 8 SSD  If this game gets optimized better then I will give it a positive review.
13153	Not recommended.  Poorly optimisied. Very blurry and stutters constantly.   Save your money and buy something. Don't just take my word for it, look at the thousands of other negative reviews.  Its shocking at this day and age a gaming company can get away with releasing something of this standard.  Massively disappointed as I really enjoyed Mafia 1 &amp; 2.
13154	Terrible, the graphics, the fps lock, the ai is dumb, everything is so damn blurry it looks like play-doh the game just feels like its a beta release to be honest. im refunding.
13155	 Early Access Review
13156	Not sure how I should put this, I payed 5.99 USD and normally it is 11.99, if I am correct, and I don't feel like I got my moneys worth even that low of a price. I respect small Indie Dev's and I don't mean for this to come across harshly, I can understand making a game with small budget or maybe this had a normal sized one, not entierly sure, it felt extremly on the low side with the quality that it was released in. I bought this for a fun cheap horror experience and honestly the scariest part was its unpredictable AI. That sounds like the making of a good game right, unpredictable AI, not knowing what the AI would do next, some prime suspense? Not in this sense, its not unpredictable in a good way. The AI constantly glitch or feel like they're on a set grid to walk or move on, they would stand still and suddenly you would be dead without knowing what happened. Some rooms, notably the Library, when you sit or jump would make the games audio/music raise in pitch of a second. It is pretty funny when you do it really fast, but immersion breaking. I hate leaving bad reviews but I honestly did not enjoy my experience with this game. If you can buy it for less than 1.50 USD then sure get it, why not, that is about as much as a phone game. It makes for some pretty funny glitches that a group of your friends can enjoy watching together.
13157	 Early Access Review
13158	This game does not support inverted mouse controls so made it unplayable for me. To leave out such a fundamental standard control option is an oversight.
13159	Well. It is cheap for a reason. The thought behind it is cool enough, but the game is not good at all. After 20 minutes I had enough. Those infected humans, or what they are, comes running at you naked with a club in their hands, and just look poorly executed, design-wised. Did not need to play a minute more in order to understand that this game is not for me at all. Actually not a game for anyone who has a slight bit of standards when it comes to a game.
13160	I'm one of the first people to sign up for EC. Got in line back in October of 2013, felt the hype, was sold on the original vision from Miguel. Over the years that changed, staff left, the game was scaled down multiple times. I kept my hopes up, kept my clan informed of it, was on the forums. I started playing the alpha in January of this year, 2016. It was rough, things were often broken, but there was some fun to be had.  Progress was slow. Weeks and months went by with known bugs ignored. Balance was very knee-jerk and overdone, never a slow and methodical approach; values were adjusted by 20% at minimum and well over 100% at maximum. Eldar and Orks were introduced broken and incomplete, and when people tried to test them on the founder's server, they were griefed by LSM guilds who were not stopped by the staff.  When the release date was announced, the entire playerbase was aghast. We all knew it was a year too early at the least, but the producer has final say so the game was released straight from alpha without a beta period. Unfortunately, this shows in the game, and the population has plumetted from where it started out.  Since launch, there have been persistent problems even getting the patch notes for when hotfixes/patches are deployed, even though they often are deployed far past the dates they were promised for. The October Content Patch was released solidly in the middle of November, with campaigns promised for the week after; campaigns are still not in the game.   Melee is still a mess, class imbalance is still rampant, and the most populous faction, LSM, has been getting far more attention and development than the other factions. For the most recent patch, which was called the, 'Chaos/Eldar patch', those two factions got a few cosmetic options they're priviliged enough to buy, BUY from a working cash shop on a full-price game, but LSM got 3 new guns at the same time. Since launch, LSM has gotten about 12 new pieces of gear, while others have gotten none; Eldar still lack basic weapon mods for their gear, while the new guns LSM got came complete with free mastery for their use and weapon mods already developed and available.  Unfortunately, the spirit of community that the game started with has vanished. There is now a very adversarial feel between the developers and the players. The devs mostly avoid the official forums, choosing instead to post here on the Steam Discussion board or in their own discord, where their moderator has boasted, 'I'm not restricted by the rules of the forum here'. They have scaled back communication to avoid the criticism and unhappiness of the players, and when they do communicate outside of the most basic announcements, there is a fair chance of unprofessional conduct towards their customers:  'oomanz (dev) calling players whiny and entitled:  https://i.imgur.com/QJ5I9ao.png  nathan (lead dev or something) bullying someone in discord:  https://puu.sh/s7IkD/68bcff716d.png  then nathan complaining about being bullied:  https://puu.sh/s72Wi/45d9fa7a90.png  nathan telling customers to burn in hell:  https://i.imgur.com/ImngIyG.png   These images were posted on another review here, by Valnak. The lead developer, Nathan, flagged this review with Steam to try to hide it, claiming it violated community guidelines, because of the embarrassing content in those images.  This is the lead dev talking about that review in their discord:  https://puu.sh/sL6Oj/5c5019324a.png  And further:  https://puu.sh/sL6Zv/6b77e64993.png   Despite personally referring 20 people directly to this game and bringing in another 60 to my guild from outside the game, I cannot recommend this game. It is unfinished, overpriced, lacking in content, lacking in direction, buggy, unpolished, laggy, and the development team seems more focused on satisfying their egos than satisfying their customers.  To everyone who bought this game because of me: I am sorry.
13161	For what it's worth, I had fun. I don't expect anyone else to have fun. I always get suckered by bad games with massive potential and stick with them far longer than I should.  That being said this game has the worst devs I've ever seen. Lack of communication and when they do communicate it makes things worse. Hopefully the October 48th patch will bring back players.  For example: 'oomanz (dev) calling players whiny and entitled:  https://i.imgur.com/QJ5I9ao.png  nathan (lead dev or something) bullying someone in discord:  https://puu.sh/s7IkD/68bcff716d.png  then nathan complaining about being bullied:  https://puu.sh/s72Wi/45d9fa7a90.png  nathan telling customers to burn in hell:  https://i.imgur.com/ImngIyG.png  
13162	I was not sure if I was going to write a review for this game, but recent events have forced me to write this review to voice my opinions and to help anyone who would want to purchase this game.   I have been a supporter of this game for almost two and a half years in total. I had the highest hopes for this game and what the developers said they were going to make it, which was a large MMO type game much like guild wars 2 but in the 40k universe. I jumped at the chance to back a game like that I mean any 40k fan would. sadly to say I invested a large amount of money (Â£570) into the game at just the promise of a full and evolving game in an MMO world which we never got which I will never do again.  The main problems with the game are known quite well such as the unstable lag spikes and the hit collision time. This makes the game not only hard to play but sometimes unplayable as you will be hit from out of now where and dying. To me, these are not as bad as people make them out to be as they can and hopefully will be fixed.  The problem I have with the game is the lack of Warhammer 40k feel which for me is the only thing they need to get right day one, bugs and balance can be patched and items can be added. As a person who has backed 40k for the last 10 years, I wanted to see the lore come alive like never before.  The game starts with four races which in this day and age is just sad especially as 40k as some of the must interesting races in fiction, even the races are the same four in every other 40k game the space mariens, chaos space marines, Eldar and the Orks I mean give us some of the other factions to play as.  The worst thing about this game is that each race feels the same which in my eyes is outrageous. each race should play and feel completely opposite, from the Eldar's hit and run tactics to the Ork's wall of bodies driving lines back in the endless green tide. even the most basic factions, the space marines are just boring to play. You don't feel like a walking tank that can take on any foe, look at the game Space marine to see what I'm talking about. I have not gone into chaos as the are the same as the loyalest apart from a few marks which do not show their respective gods very well.Each map is the same bland brown and grey map with buildings and pipes which takes away the whole epic scale of 40k which the fans wanted.  I could keep going on about how bad the game is but I don't want to as there is really no point anymore. The game will die if they devs do not fix the problems and very fast or they are going to lose this game. as for me, I am done with eternal crusade until they fix the feel and look of the game which I highly dought they can.
13163	 Based on the old (displayed clearly on the Store page up until release) infographic:  http://imgur.com/9Nl88rx    First, let me point out that at the very top, it says: Warhammer 40,000 Eternal Crusade The Game At Launch   What the game is currently missing, according to the infographic:  Factions: - Warlords Persistent World Map: - Player Driven Campaigns - Territorial Conquest - Player Objectives PVP: - Tug of War 1,000s of Weapons (Going to give them a break here and assume it as just 1,000): - About 900 of them 3 Vehicles Classes: - Has 2 (each class is just the one vehicle depending on faction), missing 1 100s of Items &amp; Ammo Upgrades: - Most of the items - Ammo Upgrades Veterans, Heroes, &amp; Elites: - Veterans - Heroes  Correct me if I'm wrong, but did the game not launch on the 23rd of September? So, up until launch, this infographic is EXACTLY what ANYONE who bought in to the Early Access should have expected to see in the game on September 23rd, considering that it is exactly what any of them would have seen up until the last possible moment before the game released. Never mind the fact that most people who had been following the game before it entered Early Access--and even once it had entered Early Access--would have been under the impression that it was still intended to be, in it's final form, an MMO. This is something that it IS NOT and WILL NOT ever be, as per an 'announcement' that may as well have never happened because I only ever heard it's mention through other posters in Steam Discussions but saw no mention of on the official website or even on the Store page.  Also, according to the current infographic, it still lists 1,000s of weapons, which simply isn't true. There are 4 factions, averaging 5 classes, and each class averages 4 weapons (not including cosmetic weapons or duplicates), you can do the math.  Well, what now? Well, I can't get a refund because I'm 52 hours into the game--because I actually wanted to check up on the game's progress during the course of its Early Access tenure--and I bought the game back in February of this year. So I'm out $40. All I can really do is cross my fingers and hope the game improves over the coming years, which likely isn't going to happen, but one can only hope at this point. What I'm NOT going to do, however, is suggest that ANYONE buy this game simply so that, at some point, I can finally play the game that I bought in to.  So,  BUYER BEWARE!  If you DO NOT want to play a game that is buggy, laggy, unoptimized, clunky, incomplete, and developed by a team that is unwilling to clearly communicate changes to it's paying customers, then STAY AWAY.
13164	Everytime I boot this game up, I tell myself, 'This time will be different. This time playing as a Havoc marine will be fun. This time I won't get killed through walls and these heavy bolters and autocannons will be the spit-fire terrors of the battlefield. This time the developers will have made the game more like we were initially promised. This time my game wont randomly crash out after 2 min of playing for no good reason.' And without fail, everytime I am wrong.  I wholeheartedly wanted this game to be great. I haven't lost ALL hope yet that one day it might be decent, or maybe even fun. But it is not this day. Not yet, not really close either.   Einstein said that, 'Insainity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.' Are we insane? I think I might be.
13165	Review Update 23/11/2016: Nathan Richardson, developers tries to push sales himself by jumping on the steam forums and telling people how great the game is:  http://steamcommunity.com/app/375230/discussions/0/152390014779167307/   This is a new low for the gaming industry and customer retention...  In other threads he tries to score with his userbase by telling everyone he is gonna buy Space Hulk:Deathwing . A product that is seen as a game that will take away customers from EC.   Review Update 15/11/2016: It seems Nathan Richardson, Senior Producer of the developer team had or or a few drinks to many recently. This is what he had to say to a criticising customer on their official forums:  http://forum.eternalcrusade.com/threads/post-the-priority-list-on-the-forums-not-just-reddit-steam.60904/#post-1331551     Review Update 10/11/2016: Aparently my activity on the forums has lead to an indirect threat by the senior developers of bE himself.:  http://i.imgur.com/uHLJjxj.jpg    Review Update 10/11/2016 :  Apparently the game is in such a weak state  (http://steamcharts.com/app/375230)  that Senior Producer Nathan has to jump on the Steam Forums himself to thank 1 steamuser for his positive feedback.  http://steamcommunity.com/app/375230/discussions/0/276237094331603994/   And then starts smartassing around with us.  http://steamcommunity.com/app/375230/discussions/0/343785380901389758/?ctp=44   On the possibly positive side:  A big content update is supposed to be released soon though. Lets see if they can deliver this time.  Review Update 11/04/2016 :  This is what the developers had to say about the steam community(was deleted shortly after, but since you cant delete whole threads he deleted only what was stated in OP:   http://i.imgur.com/QJ5I9ao.png   Thread:  http://steamcommunity.com/app/375230/discussions/0/276237094308163634/   Our thanks to brother : Sergeant_Braken , for being aware enough to take a picture before it was deleted.   No big content update as of yet as well.  MAIN REVIEW: This game went from the promise of being an Open World MMo shooter to just a lobby shooter(was calling it arena shooter before sry). The pre-ordering customers were lied to (see infogram switch below as one of the many lies) and now the publisher is pushing it out in a typical state for nowadays games. It is by no means absolutely unplayable, but its 40 -50+ (depending on your region)bucks for an arena shooter with lots of imbalances, bugs, technical issues etc.  Will it improve over time? Most likely. Will they just implement open word - MMO - RPG genre into the game? Yes, in these times were any multiplayer mode game is deemed to be an MMO yes. For those who remember what MMORPG stood for a few years ago, you will know better.  Stay away for now, wait for several patches and a hefty price drop. Or if you want to improve the way customers are treated in gaming, stay away and look for another game. Deathwing is on its way so lets hope that one is what it seems to be.   I like the game, i dont want it to die, but i dont want to encourage others to support this kind of behavior towards gamers, which has become worse and worse over the years.  Deleted thread from the steam forums: (DiscoJacen, Me and a third person)  !When you pull a launch infograph Switcheroo. 10th time deleted!  From this:  http://imgur.com/9Nl88rx   To this:  http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/375230/extras/warhammer_Description_Final.jpg?t=1474658953   At the release date!  Also NICE 10$ price increase.  EDIT: Already steathly deleted 10 times. let's see how far this will go^^  The following was stated after starting up the game up until release day:  'Warhammer 40,000: Eternal Crusade is in a Closed Alpha state, is still in early development and will continiously evolve with very regular updates. It is a Massive Online Shooter and the Early Access focuses only on creating a great shooter experience, before becoming truly massive. The persistent world, meta-game, character progression and customization, PVE and other MMO aspects will gradually be added to the Early Access.  Visit  eternalcrusde.com  for more info.'  I was banned from the forums for 'spamming' which i dont mind personally, but the thread was spammed because it got deleted by moderators from the start. I wasnt even the first one posting it.  This isn't the only place showing the infogram. But keep deleting it. You have already lost.  For people who understand german:  This review summarizes most of the core problems--&gt;  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJ4Q8AvAVzw   Even though it might run at least a bit better now (for some users)
13166	I am a Founder of the game, and have been playing since Day 1 of Alpha and Early Access. It is sad to say the game actually ran better in the alpha then it does now. Controls are clunky and combat doesn't feel like a modern game. It is not an MMO like we were promised, but a Lobby shooter. Character progression and loadouts lack imagination and depth. Game is worth maybe 15-20 Bucks and if it is on sale maybe pick it up for some entertainment.  Also there are Micro-Transactions for a full-priced game!
13167	No. No. No. And this is coming from an overkill 40k fan.   EDIT: As of 11/16/2016 devs have told customers to 'Burn in Hell' and that 'we're whiny and entitled' have fun   Tl:dr -  http://store.steampowered.com/app/55150/   At $50 you could get something actually fun, or maybe even five really interesting indie games instead. And i bought this for over $150  This...is a disaster. But it's a disaster i play (occasionally) still because it's 40k and have a shred of hope it'll become good.   To begin with -  -First of all, yeah i'm another â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ founder that supported a bunch of crap that didnt even slightly get delivered.   -The ONLY armour customisations are paid for, and each piece can go to $1-$10 each.  I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥ you not, $10 for A SINGLE pauldron. And that's only the pauldron for your right shoulder. What about your left?  And if you upgrade your armour stats in the loadout menu then the armour trim on chaos wipes out any chest customisation you may have bought. So you could've bought a different looking chaos star for $5 because â¥â¥â¥â¥ quality control and you can't even use it because you have veteran armour.  -Good christ 90% of the rogue trader store isnt even in yet. I bought a chaos quad bike and it's not EVEN IN THE GAME to name just one thing. And this is launch. â¥â¥â¥â¥ing launch.   I know people that bought unique hero skins for like $10 or some â¥â¥â¥â¥ on the website and they're not even in yet, not even a special chest piece advertised on their website. Even a half â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ implementation would at least be appreciative but oh well i guess i just payed all dat munni for a PNG with a fancy name to get added to my 'inventory' but i can't use it in game because this game has no â¥â¥â¥â¥ing clue what it's doing right now, but nah let's work on adding terminators and stuff instead of optimising it or fixing all the stupid mechanics that make people hate it or fixing the netcode so i don't get anal fisted by a melee class 50 feet away.   - Personal ships were confirmed at one point as the 'in orbit' social hub for each faction out of combat but have apparently been replaced with the 'Garrison' from early access which was originally the placeholder. Ship were a selling point for me  - Melee is godly overpowered, they can stun you, lunge at you, slam you to shake your screen, kick you in the face to also stun you and guess what? You can't fight back at all because all their weapons overpower yours and someone was too stupid to implement a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing parry button. AND melee outruns every other class.   OH OH OH AND THEY HAVE A BUTTON THAT LETS THEM LOCK ONTO YOU, so have fun escaping   - The mechanics are really user unfriendly. Particularly with heavy support classes. Melee guy running at you? Too bad, you can't even get a pistol to fight back with and you have to ponderously raise your big gun while they jetpack towards you and RMB you in the face while you get stunlocked and murdered in about a second a half. And you know, it was way too hard to use Space Marine's devastator mechanics instead because they actually...i don't  know....work...?    Oh look you've found a nice big building to set yourself up an emplacement on, well screw you because your gun can't actually look down any further than the height of the building you're on unless you move several feet to the left! Not that it matters anyway because an assault marine just divebombed you and you can't even take your gun off the railing by the time he killed you.   In addition, the mechanics of the game itself are just â¥â¥â¥â¥ing stupid... Aside from aforementioned melee and heavy supports, bolters have damage dropoff.   What.  A rocket launcher...has damage dropoff? And who the hell decided a grenade arc should be included? Oh hey and plasma weapons don't explode like they said they would.   - Overheat mechanics on the everything! So that you can't really contribute to a firefight even if you wanted to after those first 5 seconds and reloading a gun is for dummies instead!   - Also what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ is this balance, it's a different overpowered item each week, first it was mark of nurgle, then the autocannon, then the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing power fist, then the eldar, then the slugga boys (which can take on several marines single handedly by one hitting like 3 guys because â¥â¥â¥â¥ even so much as a nod to canon)   Also some weapons are just outright useless. Ala stalker bolter and regular bolter because damage dropoff (Whoever designed a sniper rifle with damage drop off better get a darwin award).   -Eldar look like a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ broom with arms and legs taped to them.   -There is no penalty at all for team killing, even though it was said loads of times there would be. I just came from a match and someone on my team sat in OUR spawn shooting us all with a fully charged plasma cannon as we spawned. And the little â¥â¥â¥â¥ got away with it, no penalty, whatsoever.   - RNG loot boxes as the only proper form of progression, aside from an advancement tree which is a mess to begin with. Also the progression is VERY grindy.  Particularly once you reach rank 3. You'll get plenty of advancement points and requisition out of battles to purchase lots of things, but the problem is that you can only go so far in your chosen field per level and then you need to grind your way up to the next experience level before you can continue upgrading your main class's tree.   Good god I don't care about sorcerer, ground assault or raptor, I just wanna work on the Havoc and Tactical trees.   And maybe even make the grind worth it to begin with for a start, the upgrades are just minor stats boosts most of the time shy of also unlocking trinkets which are..unsurprisingly - stat boosts.  - Pay2gimp/Pay2win: Okay so some â¥â¥â¥â¥ thought 'Let's NOT make all the microtransactions skins and instead make them â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ versions of pre-existing guns with mods that are WORSE than ones you find early in the game anyway!'   So my special preorder bolter that cost be an extra $35 (which i accidentally bought two of since i thought the payment didnt work but the website â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up) each is actually worse than a default bolter with the same..â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥..mods.  BUT WAIT, there is an autocannon that's far better than the default one and you can buy it with money too! Why? Because it fires â¥â¥â¥â¥ing incendiary rounds for DOTs and 3 hits on body basically everything, and that's not overpowered in the least! (sarcasm)   - Also tanks are just weird, especially ork ones, the firing arcs on the sponsons are about 30' each side. And that's also not a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dumb idea at all remember. Although preds sponsons were fixed to be completely functional thankully. Every vehicle also has zero suspension, so driving over some dunes it IN A TANK is enough to make them flip. Which is pretty frustrating.   There are a LOT of other issues with vehicles, but word limit..   - The menu, good christ was it designed by someone who is turned on by clicking the LMB? You literally have to double click (in some cases TRIPLE click) everything in the loadout menu, even to open a wargear slot and once you do, you need to wait half a second or so for the screen to arrive after a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ animation. It doesn't sound like much but it's tedious as hell.   And mousewheel support for scrolling in the menu or simply hovering over a piece of wargear to inspect the stats is too hard apparently.   would keep going but word limit.   In conclusion, don't buy it. It was so promising at one point but it was forced out for release and even then they kept stepping back on 'promises'. People like me saw how they had it all planned, and the hype went from there, we gave into the open world concept, of a player driven MMO and campaign, with personal ships. But nah, â¥â¥â¥â¥ that, we get a lazy as hell cash grab by some amateur devs that have no idea what they're doing.   If all this crap gets fixed i'll change the review, for sure. But until then it's a no from me.
13168	'Hope is the first step on the road to disappointment.'
13169	BUYER BEWARE :  At the time of writing this review the store page states this game is an MMO, this is a blatant lie the current state of the game has it being a arena based shooter like battlefield. Now I don't know anything about this founders shouting and screaming, not gonna pretend I do I wasn't there but from what I hear they ripped people off. If anything this game is another prime example of : 'Should drag them to court for it.' But that won't happen (if it does I am gonna laugh) Anyway onto the actual game review :  The game holds 4 factions with your run of the mil classes (assaults, heavy weapons flyboys etc.). The factions are : Spacemarines, orks, eldar and ofcourse the glory's of chaos (totaly not a chaos fan totaly) Next to that there are microtransactions in the game ... I should emphaize this. You pay 50 euros dollars what have you for a game that isn't as advertised, isn't complete yet and to customize your character you need to pay even more money. (full character customization can cost upwards of 40 to 30 euros) This is simply scummy no other word for it, now to the actual gameplay.  Gameplay wise the game shows it was pushed out way to early, there is game there but it runs like a car that has been shot several times in the engine. Sometimes she runs like a charm quick and good, but most of the times she is gonna cough stutter and just plain give up. Seriously I am happy when I get 10 frames, sometimes I get 30 but when the battlefield gets big and lots of things happen I just run out of frames. I think this has to do with the optimization and the servers, if rumors are true there are no EU servers or very few. Now I don't know about this but I will state that these issues can't just come from optimization alone. The game has vechiles in it, three in total though 1 type only appears in a siege mode map. They are transports that serve as spawn points, tanks with autocanons ... that aren't impressive against other tanks and the last is the siege gun which is the only one with some kick behind it. Why mention them? Because they controll like our shot car! They detect every little bump and it bounces them up and down like crazy! Can't even go straight for five seconds =/ Oh and dont get bumped into by another vechile while the frames are bad, you might get launched upwards happened to me once could happen again. Balance wise the game also feels off ... I dunno I am not great with balance but I can tell you this game isn't there yet.  Finnaly this game should be put on early access, because thats what it is an early access game not a full release. Oh yes I know the devs made promisses, but I too can offer to turn your 50 euros into 500 euros as a promise and not do it. What I am getting at is that I am I : 'See it then believe it' kinda guy, if they fix the game up and implement all that was prommised good on them. If not well then sadly this game will die, which is unfortunate because there is a game here that can be very good but is simply not finished. I will play it for a while more but for now I can't do anything but advice you NOT to buy this game and give it a negative review. Unless your cool with waiting or love this stuff so much don't get it yet, it's not finished no mater what they say.
13170	Spent 319 hours in the game , chaos almost rank 6 , now let's see I don't recommend the game because: 1) Bugs and optimisation 2) Unbalanced factions and classes 3) Melee &gt; ranged 4) Devs promised a lot , delivered barely anything 5) Every patch since the start brought us almost nothing new + they fix 1 thing and brake the other 2 6) It seems to me that developers don't put enough effort , patch is never delivered on time, promised content is always late 7) Endless grind for lootboxes for gear that makes no real difference 8) Advancement system that as well doesn't make that much difference 9) Veteran loadouts that are hard to grind for , but u get only 2 lives per match , most ofently u get team killed or plasma blobed 10) And the biggest issue , game is really really repetitive , after opening most of the boxes and reaching rank 6 u dont have much to do , not enough maps to play on , same objective on all of them. 11) Just gonna add this here , devs started insulting the players, nathan(the main dev) telling some1 to burn in hell? Really? Other dev telling us we are whiny and entitled? This is really over the edge.  Rated 5/10 , I wouldn't recommend this game , maybe only to most hardcore WH40k fans.
13171	Overall Rating: 5.0  First I should mention that I bought into Early Access on Eternal Crusade and currently the game has about 20% of what was promised for release. Check this infographic for what the game should have been at launch (this image was still up a few days prior to release a couple of days ago)  http://imgur.com/9Nl88rx  . Evidently i'm a bit â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.  Lets first review the game you will get if you drop your money on it, and not the one we were promised:  The Pros:  The game does provide a pretty decent shooter experience and a 'lite' version of playing the fantasy of WH40K. The aesthetic on the whole is pretty good. The shooting is responsive, the melee is brutal (more on that later), and the classes while not completely altering the way the game is played do have some distinct toolsets. The sound design (apart from the voices) is great, all the guns sound good and how you'd expect the universes weapons to sound like.   The Cons:  While actually firing weapons feels powerful all the while you aren't hitting something, shooting players does feel a bit like shooting them with mackerel, sometimes taking 15-20 hits to down someone where a melee player can close the gap in the space of literally a second or so and kill you in three strikes. Maybe I need to get better, but often I will see a melee character take out 3-4 ranged enemies before getting downed.  The graphics are really weird. Some parts look incredible, and others just look like crap. Some textures are really high res, others look like they come from Unreal, a game thats like 20 years old. Some of the character models are really poor too, the Orks for instance just look weird compared to the Space Marines and Chaos.  Included in the game are a small variety of modes. One plays a bit like Battlefields Conquest mode where you have to capture and hold points, and is the best part and meat of the game. There is also a very tacked on feeling PvE segment where you journey through different areas to fulfill an objective (press a button or carry a power coupling), all the while being assaulted by Tyranids.   Final Word:  Honestly, I feel that this game had problems during the latter stages of development. After following the game through from before it came to Steam Early Access, it started as an MMO not unlike Planetside where Orks were going to be the only free to play race (to simulate the higher numbers), and over the last 6-8 months has seemingly been shoved out the door as quickly as possible, leaving out the big things that would have made this game stand out like having a persistent world to fight over, player ran campaigns, and the customisation options (there were supposed to be 1000's of weapons for instance, currently there are like 40 spread over the four races).  Ultimately what we have here is an alright bare bones WH40K Battlefield clone. If your a fan of the license you'll probably like it a little more than most, but it still needs a lot more work to become a game I can honestly recommend.
13172	Pros:  -40k shooter -looks reasonably good -equal emphasis on both shooting and melee -controls are nice and fluid -pvp and pve modes  Cons:  -missing a lot of things which were promised for launch -abysmal net code, lots of lag, rubber-banding, and performance hiccups -severe balancing issues between the factions and playstyles -janky camera issues, poor fov -poor variety of maps and game modes  Verdict:  It pains to me say it, because I was really hoping for this game to be amazing, but Eternal Crusade is very buggy and plainly incomplete. While the concept is cool and you can feel the potential for it to be great as you play, this game feels like a beta that was pushed to release far too early. I wouldn't recommend it in its current state, unless you're just buying it because you love 40k. It's 'fun enough' if you're a fan of the IP, but the execution, so far, feels amateurish.  Come check it out again in like a year, maybe it'll be good by then.
13173	Stay away from this game.  As a Wh40K fan, I saw everythign the game was supposed to become and bought into it during Apha. Even though the game's 'fully released' now, it's /still/ in alpha. We were promised open world. That's gone. They said (during APLHA), that they were working on the heavy classes (terminators, wraithguard, etc). Now the game is fully released, and they're not there.  The game, in itself, is a mediocre shooter. Sometimes you hit where you want, sometimes you don't. In my opinion, the camera is too close to the character. Way too close. All of this is on top of friendly-fire beign toggled. Now this woulnd't be a problem if your cursor didn't lie to you. When firing, if a teammate is on the left side of your screen at /all/, chances are they're going to take a few of your rounds, if not your entire damned magazine.  Melee is also a hilarious mess. You have the option to 'lock on' to your opponent, thought even more issues come up from that. You can swing normally, which does little damage, or you can hold down your attack button to execute a charged attack. Or, hope to, because most of the time you'll just miss or clash weapons. This is on top of the fact that if you swing at the same time as /anybody/, it counts as a parry. So you're aiming to hit the guy in front of you. His buddy is swinging nine feet behind him. Somehow, your weapons clash.  Customizeability is nonexistant, unless you play a Marine or Ork. Also, you have to pay to play orks. So another promise tossed right out the window.  Do not spend money on this game. It's a glorified Space Marine mod at heart. None of the promised features are in the game. It's a bare-bones lobby shooter trying to pass as an MMO, and doing a â¥â¥â¥â¥ poor job of it. If you want to play a 40k game, just play one of the Dawn of War games. Or just buy into the tabletop game.
13174	Do I recommend this game? No.  FYI: I got into Eternal Crusade as a Founder (purchased the Captain Pack) due to the initial promise.  But that aside, even with the change in development (no longer Planetside like), BHVR didn't deliver the game in a solid state. Add to that the lack of communication, the inability to listen or process feedback, state of the game, the bad business model (high entry price &amp; expensive microtransactions) and false adveretising (infographic switcharoo, a new one still displaying missing things: campaigns and persistent world).  Maybe this game is going to improve someday, and yes it's getting 'frequent updates' and be worth a purchase. But until now those updates included mostly only new paid cosmetics and some new weapons. Also the whole game was build on ' coming soon ', ' will be in ', ' someday ' etc... and pilled up to be a disappointment for a good amount of people.  In conclusion: This game is probably not worth your time and money. It may be a 40K game, but it's just not a good one and the 40K theme doesn't improve that fact. So it could be better to pass and wait for another 40K shooter,   that does it right, in the first place ! To end this, a fitting quote:  âA delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad.â -- Shigeru Miyamoto
13175	Do not buy this game if you are located in Australia.  The lag is horribly, unplayably bad.  EDIT: Surprisingly, the reviews for this game on steam are not overwhelmingly negative. That being said, I've read quite a number of the positive reviews and it appears to me that the majority of them have been written by either: - 40k fans who like the game purely because it's 40k skinned, regardless of it's playability (for the record I'm a massive 40k fan but I'm a huge gamer too so playability is important); or, - current players selfishly opting to reccommend it despite it's major flaws, in the hope that if more players join the game that the developers will be more likely to improve it at some indeterminate point in the future (NB: despite being reccommendations these reviews almost always contain complaints about major flaws in the game). Please bear this in mind when considering your purchase.  Finally, if you do decide to take the plunge, remember that you can get a guaranteed refund from Steam during the first 14 days after your purchase, as long as you have less than two hours play time.
13176	BROTHERS AND SISTERS!  I could write to you of how I had high hopes for this title, like the many others who paid for entry into the earlier versions. I could explain how, despite the rough-edged game, how I was amused with the game's expansion upon the Space Marine styled control and gameplay, and how I discovered a fine-ness within, like a gem within the stone. I could discuss the large battlefields, the (limited) customization options, and how for the first time I can actually play as an Ork and go head to head against the Emperor's Finest. I could speak about the brilliant graphics, the game balance (for better or worse), or how, as a fan of Warhammer 40k from my youth, this game played me right into its hands like fresh dough.   But all of these things? Would be meaningless. All of the hard work to craft what game is here is overshadowed by an incomplete, far-too-early release. An MMO was promised, but a Warhammer-Skinned Battlefield clone with microtransactions was delivered. This game is a fraction of what it could have been, and it demands far too much in return.  Do not buy this game. Do not encourage this kind of failure. Wait for the creators to release the game they promised, instead of... This. Should such a game become so, as we all would wish, then this review shall be rescinded; and Order will be brought by the Imperium once again.  By the Emperor's Will.
13177	They promised a lot they deliver basic lobby shooter, they promise free contents.... We have none. They even didn't hand steam pre-purchase cosmetic weapons!  Game failed. Developers left the game! There is less player in game, so long queue for only 1 game. Spend your money somewhere else.
13178	To preface, I've had issues with being  being logged into the game, but not showing in Steam or logging the playtime.  [i.imgur.com]  But if you wish to attack me personally instead of addressing the actual criticisms of the game then feel free. Regardless of whether I've played 1 hour or 1000 hours, the criticisms still stand and many of them even the developers themselves have admitted to.  I'm not a mindless hater. I want this game to succeed and I would like to recommend it but until this game matches what they're currently advertising, then I can't recommend it. Note: As soon as the game launch, they changed the store page advertisements that they stated the game would have 'at launch' to a vague description. (Scroll down for proof)  What the devs (bE) promised YEARS AGO...and what they have currently delivered long past the dates they promised to deliver them are two vastly different things. It was originally announced this game would launch in 2015, not only on PC but console too...in 2015! 2015 came and went.  What's important to also note is that this 2015 release date for PC and consoles was announced by the developer BEFORE Bandai-Namco signed on as publisher so they were not 'forced' to announce that original release date.  The original refund policy, which stated refunds would be given if the game was not delivered as promised *when* it was promised is still on the game's website was worded to basically make it impossible to be eligible for said refund, because it also stated they could change the release date and those promises.  (TOS, A. Preorders, Bullet 3)  [www.eternalcrusade.com]   I'm not saying they didn't offer any refunds whatsoever (not counting Steam's refund policy) but they didn't make it easy. According to the official website, 'To cancel a purchase, you must notify BHVR in writing...' And for those people who stuck it out and waited for it to get better, they missed out on the limited window to get those promised refunds.  Now, I've been told by other players that all of the original promises the dev team made don't actually count because those were different guys! Okay...well here is what they are CURRENTLY ADVERTISING and promising on the store page:  '4 factions, 5 subfactions &amp; warlords, 5 classes, 1000s of weapons, character advancement and personalization, 1000s of armor augmentations and customization combinations, 100s of items &amp; ammo upgrades, persistent world map (including player driven campaigns, territorial conquest, player objectives, clans &amp; warparties), PVP (3 modes, Domination, Tug of War, Fortress), PVE (3 modes, Purge, Defend, Deliver), 3 vehicle classes, veterans, heroes &amp; elites and...free expansions.'  Alright...let's say for a moment that we just forget all of the other promises that were made. Okay then...I am still waiting for them to deliver the promises they are currently making.  When the actual game matches with what they are currently promising and advertising on the store page that it will have 'at launch' (which is Sep. 23, 2016), isn't riddled with bugs (obviously there will be some bugs) and is at least half-decently optimized to the point where users with high end systems, high-end GPUs (Titans), i7s and 16gb of ram aren't complaining about constant stutters and FPS problems...THEN I would recommend purchasing this game.  Edit: Now that the game has launched, they just removed  the original infographic (click here to view)  [i.imgur.com]  to one that is extremely vague and pretty much promises nothing. It would have been one thing if that is what they had *been* advertising but they have been selling the game based on those claims and then as soon as the game 'launched' they changed it to just a vague mention of PVE/PVP and some stuff. Some people might perceive this as dishonest.  There are many other problems, not just the ones I've noted. But here's one I'll let you decide on. They sell custom weapons and armor in the cash shop (yes, it has a cash shop already) for 5,000 RTC, 10,000 RTC or more. They sell 4000RTC for $5, 9000RTC for $10, 21,000RTC for $20. You can't buy a 5k RTC item unless you buy the $10 package. You can't buy a 10k RTC item unless you buy the $20 package. Some people might consider this a bit shady.  I will continue to wait for this game to be the game it promised to be. I want this game to be what you promise it will be. I will gladly change my review and write, 'You had a (really) rough start but you turned it around.' But first...you have to actually do that.
13179	I try coming back to this game every once in a while, but it is clear that the promises made by the creators will never be delivered. I expected a 40k version of Planetside 2, with characters and events from the lore, but instead was gifted with another arena shooter. The game says that it's a full release, but it's clear that the game looks and feels as if it's still in the alpha stages. The design team has promised to continue working on the game and improving it with patches, but I don't think that this will be enough to keep the game alive. We've seen these actions before with games like Evolve Stage 2 (which recently stopped development I might add) and Final Fantasy a Realm Reborn, and only in the case of Final Fantasy was the project able to be salvaged. However, this was only possible because the original design team of Final Fantasy was removed and the game taken back to the drawing board before it was re-released into the game we know today. If Warhammer 40k Eternal Crusade has any hope of longevity, it needs to follow this model. The player base has dwindled to almost nothing and at this point it is very unlikely that so many people who were promised and payed for a complete game only to be given a unfinished product will be willing to return. My advice to those thinking about buying this game is to avoid it for now and see if they are able to come up with a miracle. I love the 40k series, and I had high hopes that this title would have brought the spirit of the universe to the computer, but it is clear that this isn't the game we were hoping for.
13180	 Early Access Review
13181	TLDR; super clunky controls/movement for EVERYTHING and pretty buggy. This games as misleading as Colonial Marines or No Mans Sky. The image that mentions it has heroes/elites, 1000's of weapons AND 1000's of customization options is innacurate, they dont have any heroes and maybe 30 weapons total....  Do not buy this at all if you aren't a 40k fan, and even still do your research. All they've done is added more store items, the game as advertised is completely misleading. It's a 4 map alpha. Everything is broken. The maps feel empty and desolate, armor upgrades are $5 (each) for 3 different sizes of a chaos star on your chest, and two of the races were near ninja released and more like a concept of theory - the orks are all the same game model. Games so empty ive never been able to find a match to play PvE, and cant even kill 1 NPC when ur alone and they rush you.  I'm not trying to hate, I'm trying to save you from a bad experience.   There's always Deathwing to look forward to. :D
13182	The game in its current state is flat out terrible, not at all what was advertised, not open world,.... not even close, its set maps and lairs..... thats it, you pay for cosmetics and play a game thats currently broken in many ways, things that should have been picked up in QA werent. Now it looks like they were under pressure to get this game released, this isnt a valid excuse for the pure mess they actually did release. Release day playing stats compared to current day peak playing stats tells you everything you need to know about this game.  A shame in many ways, i love all things warhammer and wanted desperately to love this game however this is yet another games workshop/warhammer game thats been ruined.   Do not waste your money on this game, its not as advertised, flat out bad, buggy and just a blatent lie of a game and steam wont refund you. You have been warned.
13183	About me: Long time follower of Eternal Crusade before Miguel Caron left, First Wave of Alpha testers (September, 2015), Survivor of the steam release date, That one guy you see at the top of the scoreboards.   I found myself playing and hoping for the best as Miguel's Era ended and Eternal Crusade's new far light shines for its release with promises of a better lobby shooter than Space Marine, Slowly and supposed to become open world-esque. Having to spend time with the release of the game (Sep 23, 2016) for no more resets, progression was in place for all accounts,  I was in for the ride.    I cannot simply recommend this videogame after spending in game time, seeing the post launch updates, the community and the current state of the game You may ask why but tune in next friday for the patch and content update for the review! I update the review and optimization of words daily on top of hotfixing paragraphs!      The Good, the Bad and the Heresy
13184	*Edit for most recent patch as of October 27th 2016*  Nothing has improved. In fact, the game is worse. The Autocannon is completely overpowered, the Bolter is completely useless, and the gameplay is still terrible and boring. I had hoped that a few more months of development combined with going into full release would see the correction of many of this game's issues, but I was sadly wrong. The game has now taken its rightful place in my recycling bin.  *End edit*  This is a rewrite. Going to get that out of the way first. My opinion has changed drastically.  I was a Founder. I backed this game on its golden promise of an amazing 40k MMO in the style of Planetside 2. This game is not what I hoped it would be. With the most recent set of patches and 'balance' updates, the game has become entirely unenjoyable. The balance between factions, and even classes, is at an all time low, mechanics that worked relatively consistently before are now completely broken, and the worst is yet to come, however NDA keeps me from elaborating sadly.  Firstly, lets talk about what's good.  -The game looks pretty nice. It captures the 40k look well, and the models for maps, characters, vehicles, and weapons look authentic for the most part.  -The game sounds pretty nice in some departments. You can hear the servos of your power armor as you walk and run, most of the weapons sound good.  -The game captures some of the lore really well. Your character will have unique voice lines that vary by faction and even chapter/legion/craftworld.  -When the game works, it does so pretty nicely.  -You can punch a tank to death.  -The devs update the game regularly.   But it has a lot of bad. Too much.  -Firstly, some characters are almost too dark to see, meaning that Chaos often has an advantage in darker maps where they can literally blend in with the shadows, and people playing the darker colored Loyalist chapters like the Dark Angels are at a very high risk of being teamkilled because at first glance they're almost identical to Chaos, and you learn quickly that you only get that first glance to decide if you're going to open fire or not.  -While the weapons sound good, nothing else does. Some hit sounds are literally plinking noises.  -Balance is nonexistent. Chaos blatantly has an advantage due to a larger armory and a handful of broken abilities (Sorcerors with what are essentially insta-death beams that can snipe you from halfway across the map by simply pressing LMB in your general direction, wargear that makes you objectively better because you're tougher and have more health, all for the loss of relatively useless grenades and a medkit that isn't needed because half your team are playing the Sorceror with its dual-purpose heal/poison sniper beam) and so they usually win every match they play, Eldar are missing a good 80% of what they need to be competitive and almost never win. The Space Marines sit somewhere in between and are arguably the most balanced faction with no outright broken abilities or equipment, though the rage over the Storm Shield will never end, and even they can only consistently win against the Eldar.  -Vehicles float. You have almost no control over where they go and they'll often do an entire 180 without any input from the driver. The Eldar, with their actual hover tanks, have the best vehicle handling of the bunch, while Imperial and Chaos vehicles act like they're drunk on Fenrisian ale.  -The community is extremely toxic and is made up almost entirely of Chaos fanboys. If you play anything that isn't Chaos or complain about something that doesn't effect Chaos negatively, you will be swarmed by both toxic and polite, but still uncompromising players that will just tell you that all your problems are because you need to 'get good'. You've lost 99.99% of the games you played against Chaos? Must be your fault, no matter how experienced you are or well you do. Or your complaint is invalid because it's 'still an alpha' and 'they're just trying to get all the features out, they've said they're not going to do major balance until then', which is a stupid stance to take on the part of any dev team.  -People try to defend the game solely based on the fact that it's an alpha. It's not. It's a released game. They're charging 40 dollars for it, and it has microtransactions. Once you put either of those in your game, you can no longer hide behind the 'alpha' or 'beta' or 'early access' tag as a form of defense for your game being broken and unenjoyable.  -Guns feel like actual Nerf guns and do about as much damage. Melee takes 2-3 hits from all but the weakest melee weapon, which is the knife that the tactical, or 'rifleman' class gets, and get the ability to lock on so that every blow is a hit and rolling to dodge enemy attacks puts you in the perfect position to do a backstab, while a weapon like a Bolter, the most well known ranged weapon in the 40k universe and one of the most powerful anti-infantry rifles in existence, take upwards of 10-15 hits to kill someone, providing you're able to hit a moving, dodging target with its horrible full-auto accuracy, and does about a quarter of the damage a melee weapon does. Sometimes you can even empty an entire clip at someone and not get a kill with good accuracy. To put it in perspective, a bolter, which is basically an assault rifle firing rocket propelled gyro-stabilized armor piercing high explosive .75 caliber, or almost 20mm, shells, with a point blank headshot, does about half the damage of a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing knife. A KNIFE. Nothing special about this knife. It's literally just a knife, about the size of a shortsword, which is small enough to be a knife to a Space Marine. And it does 34 damage minimum compared to the 17 damage maximum of the bolter.  -Maps are horribly unbalanced, not in overall design, but in placement of the objectives. Every objective is in a tiny, enclosed space that is designed perfectly for a melee class to dominate, but means that the tactical class/equivalent, the only class that can actually cap a point, is at its most vulnerable, and it's even worse for the heavy weapons classes that literally have no ability to defend themselves in close quarters combat. Oh, but that's not all. Once again, Chaos gets a nice little advantage because their ground assault class, which is basically just a tactical with a sword instead of a gun, is able to cap points, and they're the only faction to get this nice little feature.  This game has so much potential. But it's so awful that the only thing keeping me playing it on rare occasion is how much I love 40k. This game is just terrible in its current state. Keep an eye on it, but unless you like Chaos and roflstomping the enemy with little to no trouble, stay away for now.
13185	 Early Access Review
13186	Tell me lies tell me sweet little lies.  Welcome to No Man's Sky Warhammer Edition. The game where you are promised a persistent world and find your self teleporting to maps.... a game so immersive you cant find the 1000's of weapons much like Irl. Be in awe at the massive battles consisting of coutless- wait what... 64... that's countable players. 64 player games in massive maps where vehicles only matter for 0% of the fight. . Honestly they will just help you get to the wall of the Base... after that you just zerg.  Seriously now. This game is a Base of what the trailers and advertisements promise. The persistent world is an art backdrop with make believe areas the maps take place at basically a conquest in red orchestra. The 1000's of weapons are just missing. 40 pound game has microtransactions from the get go and for a lobby shooter the combat is sub par at best.  If your waiting for a planet side 2 set in the 40k universe look no further than the door cus your in the wrong store page. If your wanting a zerg third person with alright game play this is for you.  Pros.  -Maps look beautiful if they where iconic land marks in an open world it would be amazing.  -Guns feel somewhat powerful even though they aren't -customisation into armor and such -feels 40kish at times.  Cons -No Persistent world map this is a lie -No 1000s of weapons, also a lie -Not an MMO also a lie -No massive battles of huge amounts of players, this is a lie -microtransactions... p2w and bit scummy  -a lot of missing potential, No air vehicles for a supposedly planned huge world. -Oh and the balancing I didn't mention cus this can be fixed easily but... huge problem. The way the fights are is a huge flaw. Unlimited attacker lives limited defender lives. Elder are ridiculously OP. Orcs are underpowered. GG  Overall:  Missed potential, full of lies, balancing issues, sub par combat. Feels like 40k. Tyvm
13187	 Early Access Review
13188	Cannot recommend this game to anyone for the current price being asked.  Pros:- - Warhammer 40k universe feel is spot on - ORKS - Battlefield-esque objectives system is a plus for anyone who likes those games - ORKS - Third person is always nice to see in a shooter and with the weight of everything in game it feels very like Gears of War to play - ORKS - Meaty, if hard to understand at first, melee system - ORKS - Nifty, if basic, progression system. I like progression systems. - ORKS  Cons:- - Too much imbalance between the factions, I just spent a game being one shot by an eldar with a sword that i didn't even see coming - Bugs and glitches - The game should not have launched in this state, there are far too many bugs/glitches/crashes to justify saying that this is a full release and that it has been released in the state that was intended.  - Broken promises :( this game has had a lot promised for it and looked to be heading in the right direction to hit these goals, it was planned to have a full open world with persistent maps (like PS2) and a solid PVE mode for glorious 'nid killing action but what we got is more like a watered down horde mode and an overview map with arbitrary graphics which dont really mean much. - CASH SHOP IN A Â£40 RELEASE - Some of the progression is locked behind a paywall and obvious tank killing weapons are locked far into progression when we should start with at least a grenade that helps to deal with tanks.  Once this game starts to get these free updates rolled out and once some serious balancing work has taken place then I would recommend it in a heartbeat but currently I cannot.
13189	This game is a little bit like the 40k universe, its slowly dying until its a husk of its former self, I have to wait ages to play in an actual game and the player count seems to diminish every time I log in. After playing this for 60 hours I actually long for the Tyranid Hive Fleets to just hurry up and end it all.  Gameplay is clunky, which to start of I found charming as I was playing a space marine and therefore thought that the large bulky power armour might have been developed in the game to act like it was heavy. However I've now realised that the gameplay itself is just a bit rubbish.  The Advancements thing, like levelling up, turns out to be dissapppointing too, give more buffs for players to keep them interested. At present I am not interested at all, I'm a flipping space marine in power armour, I should be powerful enough to crush an Eldar guardian with my little pinky, I should be able to soak up shuriken rounds like nobody's business and in the fluff around the universe and the tabetop game I can, however neither of these things are the case in game.   Classic Games Workshop game basically, could be good, you end up paying 40 odd quid for it because you like 40K and you come away with dissapointment.   It's too late to ask for a refund I guess, so this game will just sit in my library gathering dust.  Don't buy this game, you will be sorely, sorely dissapointed. And its such a shame because the concept of it was really good.
13190	This game just fails on so many basic levels it's amazing people are willing to defend it so blindly, well not really when you factor in the franchise.  Simply put Space Marine did it better, mechanics, balance and sadly even visuals.  Shortly after this game was announced several things were laid out as part of the end product. A persistent multiplayer game with optional PVE elements where the E (Tyranids) would attack territory belonging to the most dominant faction. Players would be able to form into groups, essentially clans and pool resources and spend them on equipment for use in missions for that little extra edge. Orks would be a free to play faction with limited free progression. Real money could only be spent on making your characters look different. What did we get and what do we have now?  A basic lobby shooter with 4 factions with different playstyles and equipment with the two closest being Space Marines and Chaos Space Marines. Herein lies much of this game's problem, balance. From patch to patch the broken faction has changed and while stuff like this happens in development some of what has been seen here is just asinine. The fragile but fast and hard hitting faction face tanking but moving quickly and killing faster than any other being the most recent example.  Another major issue is map design which can be described quickly as vast lanes to get mowed down in by stupidly accurate, high damage and RoF instant supression weapons between clustered forts filled with vast amounts of cover favouring melee. The latter environment just comes across as clutter which may be nice to look at while walking around but does not help in actual gameplay.  The leveling system leaves new players at a disadvantage requiring in game credits to purchase anti-tank weapons and long range weapons. The AT part is significant given how the dominant strategy is to park the overly tanky APCs right outside the capture points in order to spawn 30m away and rush in with melee. While I can appreciate the reward of closer spawn for a well placed APC the current version of the game promotes point blank meat grinds as opposed to ranged combat.  Lastly and probably most importantly is the asymmetry which could be balanced well but allows for some really abusable styles of play. The Eldar for example have a ranged automatic weapon that blinds the target more and more with each shot, now imagine several of those against factions which have no counter to this. (Marine helmets are supposed to counter stuff like this anyway.) Chaos Sorcerers can heal from afar over time with their beams, a group can clump and mass heal each other while chopping away with power swords. Another common example is finally killing that Havoc who was 3-4 shot killing your team with an autocanon from a window (an issue of it's own kind) only for him to be revived from cover 10m away.  The game had and hopefully still has potential but I fear that this early launch will cripple the game and see it terminated prematurely. It has the beginings of a great game and finally a 40k game that could last beyond a lowly 2-3 years.  As for the price hike? Most people who read into the game and it's reviews aren't going to buy at half that price let alone Â£39.99  *update*  Just found out that Orks are broken too, who'd have thought? Face tanking plasma gun shots and killing in 2 melee swipes after taking 4-5 hits is fair and balanced. Funny how the mob faction can only be beaten through superior numbers.
13191	This is a horrible game, and I am a founder, I spent $150 when this game was just brought up to help support it. I regret every paying 1 cent for this game and hate the state of the game that it is in. For a warhammer 40k game it junk, for an FPS its a joke, and the melee combat is the biggest failure of the game. I have never wrote one review for one steam game until this game, it is because game is so horrible I didnt want anyone to lose money on it like I did.
13192	Game apparently released yesterday. Which makes no sense considering the game has nowhere near amount of content they pitched in the beginning, and barely close to the amount of content that is advertised on the steam page. It's a buggy, ugly, clunky mess of a game. If you want something like it, go play Space Marine. It's leagues better than this. Eternal Crusade is DOA.   But hey, if you spend your money now, the lead producer said that you MIGHT get the game you paid for in the future through free updates.   What a joke.
13193	My Opinion: The game is unfinished, it's been pushed out early.  I originally had a positive review for this, and that may come again, but at this point in time, I cannot even play it, It's suppose to be more stable,  I get 5-10 second freezes every 20-30 seconds, even on the character select screen, playing is pointless.  (Forcing the EC process to real time has  mostly  fixed this) The amount of areas where you can't even clime are stupid, see a good spot on to hit some targets, Oh but that little knee high step is in your way... The optimization is, in general horrible, I'm running 2 7970s (a little old I know) in cross fire and can only really have a go at playing on low settings. I've seen better looking levels on UT3 that where just as big and ran smooth as hell... The game is a CPU hog BTW.  I bought a founders pack back when the original team leads were building hype for this title, how many of them are left? 1? I've followed a lot of EA games, and I've never seen such a turn over of lead staff in such a small time... They drop Miguel, and we get Nathan, and then the feature removal begins, No open world, No F2P orks etc etc... Now the game feels like a less fun version of THQs Space Marine in a bigger level.  Game feels slow and heavy, animations are pretty meh, like something that could be good, but is now on the abattoirs table with its guts ripped out so it could be shipped off ASAP...  I'm willing... I want to change my vote on this game, but until I see some results I cannot.
13194	Bad graphics for UE4. Bad optimization for UE4. Which I'm willing to forgive for such a small studio and the fact that it's a warhammer game. but Terrible gameplay balance. No seriously, the balance is so bad in this game it's weird. They nerfed eldar from the game and won't stop buffing loyalists to compensate for bad loyalist players. Terrible map design forcing gameplay balance to be even worse than it already is. It's secretly just warhammer: space marine: mechwarrior online edition The devs are extremely slow, overpromising â¥â¥â¥â¥. They said eldar in november 2015, then december 2015, then february 2016. They finally came out 3-4 months after that and with so little polish it was comical.  But it is fun so it has that going for it.
13195	*Please note: This review was made during the head-start period, it was made based off the actual live client.*  I cannot recommend this game in it's current state because it does not offer anything other lobby shooters do better already.  Once the novelty wears off from this being a WH40K title, you realize that the vast majority of the game mechanics are terrible. The game was originally billed as an open world MMO, but has slowly been trimmed down to what it is today. This game is a poor attempt at a lobby based shooter with an absolutely idiotic World Map attempting to make you believe there is something greater going on. The maps are 85% devoid of action, melee is king (the melee mechanics are horrible on top of that), and most battles are just spamfests of grenades/melee.  The reality is that this game was in Alpha status last week, and is now being released with promises of what is to come. These are the same promises that were being fed to the hype train for over a year now. Promises are not reality, reality is this is a game still in Beta.  Wait on this one until the game is fleshed out, if it ever is fleshed out.  Edit #1: 24-SEP-2016  Put some more time into the game on the release client, and wanted to point out a few additional items.  First, the maps were designed for large scale conflict, you know something Planetside 2 in scale, but the matches are limited to 30v30.  Second, there is nothing more to the game than run to a capture point, defend it, and repeat. There is nothing more to this game. There is no deathmatch mode, it is just capture/hold/repeat.   Take these two points and add them together. You have large maps, mostly unused because there are NO objectives besides the capture points. This causes a large amount of the combat to be clustered on the capture nodes. So the vast majority of the map is pointless because by design the game forces you to where the experience comes from, that being the capture nodes (where all the combat is actually happening).  The melee system is king, as it was during 'Alpha.' See that melee guy charging you, let's shoot him. He has a shield though, so you do not damage him. Now he is in melee range and if you try to continue shooting you will be animation locked by the melee guy spamming his melee attack. This has been a balance issue since last year when I played on the Founder's access.  Character handling is also clunky. Combat is also clunky. A newer player will find melee interrupts are not even bound to the keyboard so you will be at a disadvantage from the start.   Even though I enjoy the WH40K universe and lore, I still cannot recommend this game in it's current state. A fan will enjoy being able to play as a Space Marine, Orc, Chaos Space Marine, or Eldar...then you realize the game is really bland and empty. It is a very unrewarding experience playing the game, and the point of a game is to be enjoyable. Let me hammer this point home, this is not about promises or plans from the developers, the game itself is bland and boring.  As stated at the start of this review, this entire review has been based on the Release Client. They marked it 'Pre-Release Review' because it was originally made during the head-start period for the pre-ordered players.
13196	This game is still in a pre alpha state. Even the BF4 Beta was more stable than this. This is no weapon balance, ranged combat is a mix between worthless or overpowered. The Ork faction is unplayable due to the mechanics being desgined around the marines.   Here is a list of things that need fixed: The lag The weapon balance The vehicles (like just start over) The UI Models Hitboxes Controls Unlock system  And the Melee system that has been redone again and again yet is still bad and all the devs' have to do is copy Space Marine in order to fix this.  Also There are no dedicated servers, because that makes sense for an MMO. In short this MMO deserves the Emperor's blessing via a bolt gun to the head.
13197	UPDATE: Game is 'Released' and It's the same, alpha trash.  WARNING: Developers making threats after I uploaded this review, threatening to 'moderate' it while stating that everything is 'my opinion' (ad hominem) even though video &amp; photo evidence has been given for every discussed point. Lead designers for this game are also jumping ship left and right:  http://massivelyop.com/2015/05/01/eternal-crusade-lead-level   ----------  Warhammer 40k: Eternal Crusade is a game with immense potential. But as of right now, It is a hogwash of a shooter experience. Why? Let me list, demonstrate and explain 3 different areas of problems as to why I feel this way:  ---------------  1. The movement system has SERIOUS problems. As of right now, It is -literally- impossible for you to traverse jagged terrain that is even slightly above your current elevation, be it mountains, a cliff, a rock or otherwise. Example of this here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPdoGQ3v6Ao   You will NOT be able to get over/ontop of that thing unless you catch some air walking up a ramped area first or if you're a specific class with flying capabilities. This is contributed to the fact that there is indeed no actual jump button in this game. You either do a combat roll with spacebar or fly temporarily using a jetpack that is only available to the assault &amp; raptor class. Any other way of getting around/over things REQUIRES you to have either the 'Vault' prompt that is only available over railings or the 'Climb' prompt that is ONLY available at certain windows (and boxes) that is within arms reach (And even this is a disabled 'feature' for 2 of the classes). All of this is made much worse with the design decision for player corpses to create collision positive ragdolls. Just executed a guy in a remotely tight room and/or in a corridor? Have fun floating and warping around on his glitchy corpse in the air, waiting for it to despawn or pray to RNG jesus that your character can slide off him and roll away before you die.  -------  2. The shooting mechanics in this game are currently horrendously frustrating on a multitude of different levels. Take using scoped weapons for example. Instead of having your character use the actual scope of the gun, he will instead 'zoom in'. 'He could have a camera system in the scope going to helmet' you could argue.. But the zooming is not even made from the character's head. It is made very high up from his right shoulder which means that every shot you take while 'scoped in', you'll have to deal with this kind of trajectory:  http://steamcommunity.com/id/Coeco/screenshot/317872034468448160   Another example is the massive handicap that dealing with rails and other waist-high objects bring, your character will, regardless of circumstances, absolutely refuse to brace or lift his weapon above cover to shoot on what is the other side. This means that If you have the higher ground behind cover, you will NOT be able to shoot downwards, giving the guy with no cover a horrendously big advantage unless you jump down:  http://steamcommunity.com/id/Coeco/screenshot/317872034468451967   During my hours of play, I've found that the gunplay for next to all weapons feel incredibly inconsistent. Sometimes it feels like I'm shooting through walls, sometimes It feels like my gun is being shot from below my left waist, sometimes it feels like the bullets aren't going straight, sometimes I've shot behind a guy's Ã ss (his shadow) just to be credited with a headshot kill.. There is just a LOT of wonky stuff going on with the guns and the player's perspective (and hit detection) in this game. To show another example that you can test yourself incredibly easy, simply look straight down and shoot with an even moderately long weapon to get these disconnected results of the bullets shooting out of the side of your gun instead of out the barrel as the distance from the barrel to the ground in this picture is about an inch:  http://steamcommunity.com/id/Coeco/screenshot/317872034468462058   With some minor research and close studying of mechanics, I've found out that the bullets are actually shooting out of your hands instead of your weapon most of the time, video example of this here with a tank in action where the shells are not exiting through the barrel of the gun:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEZvh6eR6ZA    This overall wonkyness is made much worse from the lack of flexibility this game currently has. You cannot change your shoulder view, you cannot change your dominant weapon hand, you cannot disable the 'Cover' system that urges your character to slam and glue himself onto any wall or piece of cover he gets close enough.. And the list just goes on and on.  -----  3. Balance &amp; Game mechanics. As this section is mostly up for debate, I'm simply going to quickly and briefly explain them and hopefully you'll see where I'm coming from:   A) Tanks. They are absurdly durable, fast and can do the most hilarious flipping and flying I've ever seen in my life when driving over obstacles or tipping over:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Il1ciRSei1A   Unfortunately, they can also effortlessly snipe people across the map and act like giant meatshields to block up important corridors and pathways (Sometimes even mission critical):  http://steamcommunity.com/id/Coeco/screenshot/317872034468675217   'Just destroy them' you say? Doesn't work because the debris of said tank will still be there, blocking entrance and It cannot be moved or interacted with whatsoever. They are also the go-to tools for the in-game cancer that is spawncamping:  http://steamcommunity.com/id/Coeco/screenshot/317872034467348091    B) A sorcerer healing someone that's knocked down with their beam can outheal INSANE amounts of damage done to the guy downed. This can make people essentially immortal in drawn-out corridor fights because if they get KO'ed, they can just crawl back into cover, get up and go back in before getting yet again, knocked down. Rince and repeat:  http://imgur.com/MpJSzyo   C) Melee spam is horrendously prominent and overly viable right now as people who play the role of meleeing (Assaults/Raptors) have not only the most mobility but also the most HP, being able to soak up enormous amounts of bullets while doing nothing but spamming M1 that causes you to become stunlocked before also shredding you dead with 1-2 hits effortlessly without cooldown or even a stamina cost while using the currently broken beyond belief chainsword. 99.8% of all Assault/Raptor user gameplay currently looks a little something like this:    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rR1IGBIafj8   D) Zerging. People can spawn with as little as 1-2 seconds after being killed and once mixed with say, a camping spawnbeacon tank, it turns into an utter f*ckfest where you can kill the same row of people 20 times within a minute and It will not slow them down in the slightest. There are no cool-downs whatsoever besides a predetermined timer that revives everyone every 12 seconds or so. Completely unacceptable in a game that also has a revive/knockdown system with dedicated healing classes.  ----  Along with all of the above, the game also has a horrendous FPS &amp; latency performance while also only currently having servers in the US. Sure, It's alpha. Sure, It's early access.. But there's less than 4 months left until the official release of this title and as of right now, the game is currently a small, instanced 16v16 space marine deathmatch simulator that's struggling with crippling imbalance, bugs, performance and lag when we were promised an entire MMO.   To add further doubt, the guys making this game has also been extensively planning 'after launch' content which is at this point in time yet another excuse to release an unfinished game onto Steam.  TL;DR: Game is roughly around 2-3 years from being done but the release is stated to be within 4 months. Exercise extreme caution when considering to buy this.
13198	I can't recommend this game in it's current state. Lacking features promised on launch, buggy, unbalanced. It's just not finished.
13199	This game was a money grab game that had a lengthy development time, and failed to produce results. I wish I could get a refund. To be quite frank, they could save the game if they finish it over time but, it will be dead by then, or they could make this a successful lobby shooter with a mixed reputation. As of now, Space Marine and No Man's Sky have almost more players daily. If they implemented a system in which the RTC cost was lowered, had people buy their favorite chapters as a skin, say for a dollar or something, they could get the funding to save this game.  However, that's the main hang up. They know the store is the future and they won't do anything with it, and even if they did we know it's not really a lack of funds as we've noted with the founders purchases (who they screwed out of refunds by breaching their contract over a two day period, in which the refunds were cancelled.) They also have a poor development team, any lead dev that has touched this game has just disappointed us and seemed to not care/be inept at their job. Moreover, the HR manager has never worked anywhere else aside from this game, and she's pretty terrible at her job on the forums. This combined with the fact this company has only produced vaporware, has lead to disaster.  Then let's get to this MMO bit, when they had misleading adverts for months when they cut the MMO aspect. This game has /launched/ and they claim it's an MMO which is an insult to MMOs. This game is as much a persistent and an MMO as my crap out of the toilet bowl is edible and delicious.  EC is a lobby shooter. It's not WOW, not Everquest, not Planetside 1 or 2, etc. I don't dislike it anymore but, let's stop pretending it's something that it isn't. It makes me feel like Nathan is just a snake oil salesman like every other lead dev for this game. However, I'll clarify my stance. It's not the game at this point - it's the developers I take issue with. EC could be great. Due to this constant twisting of what they are marketing, it is not.  Speaking of crap above, let's get back to that. Back in May, I had what appeared to be food poisoning at the time. (Turns out, my body has changed and I have life threatening allergic reactions to the same shellfish I've eaten my entire life, oysters, mussels, stuff like that.) Why is that even paramount to this review? Because, while playing a lobby with team-mates and close friends, I crapped myself.  And I was more mad about this game and having purchased it, than having to get up and clean up the raw sewage off me, my chair, and my shorts. â¥â¥â¥â¥ Eternal Crusade.
13200	I've edited this review after further playing. I do not change my recommendation, but now feel I can better explain it.  I wish I could say that this game was worth picking up, but in its current state it simply isn't.  It's not an MMO in any form, it's not the Planetside-like game that was originally talked about, and it has a long way to go before it's ready to be a simple arena shooter.  I love 40k and this is simply another game to add onto the long list of poor 40k games.  Firstly, I will be comparing this game heavily to Space Marine by Relic that was released years ago. I do this because the game clearly draws heavily from it. The game desperately wants to be Space Marine, and it's obvious from almost everything it does from movement to basic combat mechanics. However, Space Marine was clearly a finished game and polished whereas this is not so if you're going into this expecting a Space Marine like game, you'll be disappointed.  The closest thing to compare this game to is Space Marine's multiplayer. Even though Space Marine relied on peer to peer networking, it still has superior netcode to Eternal Crusade. Rubberbanding and taking damage through walls is a common occurance even with sub 30 ping, leading to a frustrating experience.  Performance on even the most high end machines is also sorely lacking. These two things combined mean that many times you will NOT know what killed you or how.   The melee system is broken partially because of the two above items, but also because it greatly favors the person with the heavier weapon. In a duel, most often what will happen is that the person with the heavier weapon will break the others weapon and then finish them off even if the other person has played the RPS mechanic correctly. The other problem is that the system is clearly designed for duels, which would be great, if it wasn't Rock Paper Scissors and if most melee fights didn't end by someone else coming in and joining the fray, thus rendering the system moot.  Unlocks are mandatory in order to be of any use on the battlefield, so expect to be cannon fodder for a good number of games that will most likely drive off many players. Unless of course you're Eldar, for some reason they get all necessary classes as presets. Try killing a vehicle with a preset for Chaos, SM or Orkz and you'll be extremely disappointed.  If you enjoyed the cosmetic customization in Space Marine, you'll not be happy with how cosmetics are done in Eternal Crusade. There's a payshop and this is where it primarily comes in. If you want a new helmet, armor or pauldron, you're paying real money for it. Space Marine had more and better cosmetic options built into the game from the start that you didn't have to pay additional money for.  From a static perspective the game looks alright, but when in motion the rough animations are apparent. The sense of weight that was in Space Marine is absent and character models glide over the ground rather than run. In addition, the maps have numerous issues with them that still need to be ironed out. It's not uncommon to get stuck on the tops of stairs or ramps because you're not going up them exactly how the devs want you to. Mounting a weapon to a wall doesn't necessarily mean youll be able to shoot downwards though, leaving you with a worthless angle of fire that goes to the sky and nothing more. The devs say that this is done to prevent clipping that looks ugly, which is interesting as there has been no attempt at fixing the clipping issues on the player models.  To put it succintly: the game simply isn't close to being finished despite having been 'released'. Maybe at some point in the future it'll be worthwhile, but as it stands it's simply not worth it.
13201	The game's 'genetically engineered Super-Humans', aka 'Space Marines' feel like Rambo wearing platemail armor not an Adeptus Astartes wearing Power Armour. Their movements are slow and sluggish because of foolishly applying the idea that a heavy object must also be slow, despite the fact Astartes are said to not only be stronger and faster than Humans when unarmored but to also have their strength and speed further enhanced by their Power Armour, whose power servos counter its own weight to prevent the Marine from feeling its effects unless they lose their balance. Even after a high fall or drop they can rise to their feet very quickly.  Their 'Power Armour' is more like paper armor as it provides less protection than the Marine's own body, which has now apparently become more durable than plasteel and ceramite despite facts from the WH40K universe indicating the opposite.  The majority of weapons fire too quickly and deal too little damage per shot, feeling more like modern weaponry with WH40K skins. The non-majority of weapons tend to deal too much damage per shot and as a result have a completely unnecessary limiting factor(I.E. lock-on for lascannon) added in to reduce their effectiveness.  The other factions are based around the slow and poorly equipped 'Astartes' and therefore face similar statistical and design issues.   Overall, the game feels like a mediocre lobby shooter with WH40K skins and your money would be better spent on Battlefield 4 or 1, Battlefront, Gears of War 4 or For Honor.
13202	I'll be quick, since i have nt played much yet. I may add stuff later if it's relevant. Don't buy this complete and utter crap. This game represents everything that's wrong with Greed in developers.  And i'll support that claim with two major things :  -First, a thread on official forums that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ me off so much i fell into the trap of believing it was from a dev (also because other people linked it as being from a dev) :   http://forum.eternalcrusade.com/threads/this-is-a-message-for-all-warhammer40k-fans.57370/  It's basically asking us to upvote it, 'to promote the warhammer franchise'. Except our vote doesn't engage us on the warhammer franchise but on the greedy thief studio that is using its copyright or license if you will (which has nothing to do with games workshop) aka Behaviour Interactive. This is unacceptable, because kids and stupid people can't understand the difference and will indeed upvote it for completely different reasons. Such a thread should have been closed and deleted instantly since that's what they're doing with a good part of this guy's posts (as you can see commented on his profile), yet it took 23 pages and a request from OP for personal reasons to close it, but thread being in their interest they kept it.  - Second, Miguel Caron, previous head of Behaviour interactive has left the studio with his good share of the loot chest, and promises about the game. His replacement, Nathan Richardsson, took several months before revealing his plans about the game.  Which is why we knew so late that they gave up on the open world.  While this was supposed to be a Planetside2-like competitor with both open world, and classic FPS battlegrounds, this is now just a poor Battlefield. To be honest, i even feel ashamed to compare these 2.  So there you go, for the formidable features of this game :  -Terrible optimization (i have a 980 TRI-SLI and there snt a single moment when it's fluid w/e option i disable). -Total unbalance between each class, faction, and role. -Complete overprice for a product that would nt be worth 20 euros considering the competition. -A F2plike marketplace in a full price game. -Server lags, and it doesnt look like there are european servers at all. -Collision bugs, stuckunderthemap bugs, damage and heals not landing bugs, camera bugs, respawn bugs, bugs bugs bugs . This game shoulda been called lord of the flies bugs.  I could go on, but overkill won't make my point any clearer.  Stay away from this robbery, and definitely stay away from Behaviour interactive, which is using the warhammer franchise to make a couple of bucks off it's customers and then just quit working on it, as it is quite obvious that they will.  Nope, just Nope.Don't even.
13203	I really wanted to like this game, truly I did. However the sad truth is I just can't. As a die hard Warhammer fan I was all for this when I heard about it, I wasn't put off by the transition into a lobby shooter and still viewed the countless pitfalls with rose tinted glasses. I wanted to love the game.  -Visually   if you can run it   the game is certainly something to look at, the atmosphere is great and puts you in the setting rather well. -The sound is great also,  when you are not being plauged by constant chainsword reving, thrusters, turret pivot and numerous other audio bugs   the sound of distant fire and the chaotic chorus of melee is awesome. -The setting of the game being the Warhammer universe is awesome. Not much beats bringing death to the enemies of the emperor   yes I play SM   -The progression   or lack thereof   is actually quite fun and rewarding   Boxes...why..   -When   if   you manage to get a good team going, split into squads it's really good fun and rewarding   However.....however..Â£39.99 for a fully released, complete game I would say is reasonable...this is not a complete game. When you take into account that before 'release' the game was Â£29.99 it makes you raise an eyebrow AND micro transactions?, who and why did they put microtransactions in a Â£39.99 game.  Eternal Crusade for me will always be an Eternal Dissapointment.
13204	 Early Access Review
13205	Preface:   Terrible Game. Buy Warhammer 40k Space Marines instead, it's older and cheaper but it has: Tons of customization, a campaign, it plays well and does so on older machines. It looks better than Eternal Crusade and it's multiplayer is balanced and refined.   Review:  A game that had a kickstarter and Early Access had no right to be this bad for its release. It's filled with bugs, it's poorly optimized, the models and weapons look like plastic toys. The game is unbalanced and has pretty poor sound design. It's gameplay is utterly attrocious, with rubberbanding, low ticket rates and ultimately stupid design decisions for every faction.   This is, at the best, worth 5 dollars. Not the 50 dollars they're currently asking for at the time of this review. It's poor and its spiritual predecessor, Warhammer 40k: Space Marine did everything this game does and does it better. It also has a campaign! So, go buy that. This game?   It's utter trash. Beyond trash. It's actually a scam.   The developers should be ashamed for this easy cash grab. Well, you managed to steal my money. I hope you steal no other people's money in the future.   Kindly, go â¥â¥â¥â¥ yourselves.
13206	The game is unfinished; Essentially this game went from the promise of being an Open World MMO shooter (planetside 2 scales) to just an arena shooter.
13207	PROS &gt;it's 40k, for fans like me getting a 40k game is always exciting and appreciated.  &gt;several factions, you get to play as space marines (both loyalists and traitors), eldars and orks  &gt;there's a coop mode against tyranids too  &gt;good variety of weapons, and there is cosmetic customization for your character  &gt;as an early founder, I can tell devs (at least the current ones) has always been willing to work on this game and deliver a decent product  but..  CONS &gt;again, it's 40k. Lot of fans are willing to defend this game no matter what, only because it's pretty much the only 40k multi shooter at the moment. Not to mention founders who invested a certain amount of money and hype in this, and waited years to be able to play this game; they'll understandably be reluctant to give up and see it for what it actually is.  &gt;there are several factions, it's true, but balancing is â¥â¥â¥â¥. This has been a big problem since alpha was released for founders, and we're still far from a good balance.  &gt;let's be honest, coop mode is half â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. it's repetitive, AI is plain terrible, you just go through the same, small dungeon over and over, killing some enemies with no depth at all  &gt;great variety of weapons means of course difficult balancing issues. One of the things that need more balancing than everything else is probably melee combat. The melee mechanics are clunky, random, confused and the lag that afflicts the game plus bad hitboxes/netcode don't really help. Honestly the best way to fix melee right now is to redo it from scratch. Some might say this notion could be applied to the game as well.  &gt;visual customization is pretty basic, and you'll need to pay for it with RTC, points you get by paying real money. I have to say I got some of them for free, being a founder, but I hope new players start with some of them as well, otherwise they'll be forced to pay if they want their character to not be a preset clone, and pay a lot. I know this is a somewhat established mechanic in these games, but if I have to spend real money for my character cosmetics in some game I want a good variety and quality. And, of course, it has to be a good game.  &gt;devs didn't deliver what was promised, and what people payed and were hyped for. Right now the game is a messy, buggy arena shooter- I don't even have a problem with it being an arena shooter actually, but at least let's make a good one.    There's a lot of stuff to fix, game has the potential to improve, I certainly hope it does but right now I don't really feel like recommending it.
13208	Game feels awful to play, probably worth about Â£10. How they Justify a full blown price tag is unbelivable, don't buy.
13209	I cannot safely say this game will last a month at current rates. It has fun moments, but it's a lobby shooter. This is only MMO in the way you say call of duty is an MMO.  -UPDATE  The development team is taking too long to fix things, add things, do thing. The game needs more things.  Not much else to say here other than make heavy bolter great again.
13210	 Early Access Review
13211	Founder here. Unfullfilled promises so far. Cannot reccommend until the open world (aparently never now?) version is released. Its a lobby shooter trying to compete with Battlefield, CoD, Overwatch, etc. It doesn't stand a chance. The mellee system is a breath of fresh air, but its other mechanics are not solid enough to pull peoples time away from those other shooters. If it actually launched with the open world (e.g. Planetside) it would have been a huge success since PS2 is all but dead thanks to p2w pricing and there isn't any other choice on the market. Just.....dissapointed. :(
13212	Game has potential to be a solid 40k title thats fun and rewarding. But in its current state i would not pay 50$ for it. The PvE is playable with not many performance issues. The PvP on the other hand is highly unoptimized, Droping to the low 20s in large fire fights with gpus like the Gtx 1070 and Rx 480. The games visuals do not in any way warrrant a low frame performance with mid to higher end cards like it currently is. The game is plagued with a overly saturated bloom effect that no doubt tanks performance without the option to turn it on or off. These speical graphical effects are not very well implemented and pretty much breaks the performance of the game.   Performance issues aside the gameplay was fun from what i was able to play of it. You have many customizable options to choose from, weapons to armor and even trinkets that increase different attributes. You have 4 different factions, orks, space marines, chaos and eldar with a variety of different classes for each of them. You have lighter skirmishes to grand battles that involve all the factions. The concept is different but rewarding and fun, but as the game is now it is no where near complete you are paying 50$ for a stage 1 alpha basically. As of now i can't recommend this game maybe in about a year from now it will be a different story.
13213	It pains me to submit a negative review of this game. So many good qualities if only it was promised from the beginning. This game has gone from an MMO Shooter (See Planetside) to an arena brawl which lacks so much. So many promises for founders and yet we have nothing. a 50 dollar price tag is simply not worth what this game offers in the slightest. On top of this toxic devs makes player outreach impossible.
13214	Rather than working to release a complete, polished product the development team instead chose to shoehorn in a cash shop because the $50 they're charging for this dumpster fire apparently just wasn't sufficient. If that wasn't bad enough what they've chosen to charge you for is ridiculous; the Imperial Aquila, found in some form or another on the chest piece of every suit of Space Marine power armor, is paid DLC. That's right, you'll need to pay for the privilege of your character sporting one of the most iconic details of the table top miniatures.  At the risk of repeating the reviews of everyone with standards I'll also say that the game's performance is terrible, its animations something out of the $5 indies you'll find elsewhere on Steam, and its balance nonexistent. Do yourself a favor and spare yourself the aggravation of playing this disgrace.
13215	As an original founder for over a year and a half, I can say that I am wholeheartedly disappointed. I would have GLADLY waited another year for a finished game and promises to be fulfilled. Until those things come to fruit, I can't recommend purchasing.
13216	 Early Access Review
13217	The game is very much playable, but it feels lacking. The multiplayer is akin to space marine's multiplayer on large maps with vehicles. At the moment the number of players is lower than I believe it should be; based on the scale of the crusade. With that said, I do enjoy it and feel that serious 40k fans would too. It seems to be the best fix if you have the urge to kill competitively in the 40k universe. Character creation lacks the depth of Space Marie and the chapters/legions/clans don't seem to serve much purpose within their races, which makes me wonder why there are so few represented. Game has a huge amount of 'potential', but potential doesn't deliver anything until it is content. One thing that is interesting is the upgrade tree that adds some progression to your character. As you gain XP you can spend points to carry a more lethal arsenal or make your character mor effective stat-wise.   Overall: Dont't buy for $50. It feels like a larger version of space marine multiplayer with a LOT of unfinished ideas.
13218	 Early Access Review
13219	  Welcome to Heroes and Generals: Warhammer edition....minus the optimization and fun. Prepare to be completely confused and get wrecked by large clans who seems to one shot/sword you consistently, while you stumble around with clunky mechanics and weapons that never seem to hit the target. Coupled with the power of 32fps average on low, you will have the time of your life never being able to feel like you truly did anything successful at all..
13220	Game support is horrible. Paid for items in the rogue trader on the website, that are IN game and I can not access them without repurchasing them. So they took my 40,000 in Rogue trader points on the website before launch but did not give them back since they are making rebuy them in game again. I contacted support which took over 2 weeks and multiple tickets to get them to respond. It was a generic response saying the items are not yet in game, yet the sternguard bolter I purchased shows up in the launched version already, ready for purchase.
13221	This is not the game that I was expecting to get when I backed this project. Thank you for showing everyone again why backing early access games is bull-â¥â¥â¥â¥.
13222	Should be called Warhammer 40k : Eternal Microtransactions.  Like, seriously, you can't even customise your character without paying more money on top of the Â£40 odd for the game, and some weapons (With different, better stats.) are locked behind a paywall.  Genuinely, there's barely any content in the game to begin with, and 1/3rd of it is behind a paywall.  Don't bother gettin' this. Just. â¥â¥â¥â¥in'. Don't.  Spend the money on a full game, with Â£40's worth of content that's not behind a â¥â¥â¥â¥in' paywall. Hell, there're free to play games that're more worth the price tag of this game than this game is.  It's a scam.
13223	Two-Faced developers.  terrible and absent balancing between classes, weapons and factions.  In game store, absurd pricing for items (cosmetic and other wise)  RNG ridden supply crate system ( a 'high' tier requisition box can give you a minor bolt gun mod.)  NETCODE issues out the â¥â¥â¥, this game acts like a peer to peer server in the early 2000.  
13224	TLDR: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME it's not DONE just buy overwatch/battlefield if you want a lobbey shoter    Massively online fps, huge battles, rpg elements, mad customization, quality graphics, lots of classes, open persistent worlds.  vs  Lobby Shooter, 5 classes, basic customization, clunky graphics, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ controls, Not massive, no huge battles. 2 types of vehicle, with frankly laughable guns. PVE hilariously bad.   Essentially this game went from the promise of being an Open World MMO shooter (planetside 2 scales) to just an arena shooter. The pre-ordering customers were lied to and now the publisher pushed it out in a typical state for nowadays games. It is by no means absolutely unplayable but by everything that's holy this is not a persistent world and no Nathan what you said on twitch doesn't make it so.....  The game has no influence from the wins or losses of any particular match it's only and solely a damn lobby shooter nothing that was promised or planed was delivered at 'launch' if you can call this suicide attempt from the game a launch...   So far the game has only 3 things going for it  1.It's fun cause it's a fresh game with a Warhammer 40k skin 2.It's rly team depended and you can enjoy playing with friends 3.It can't rly get any worse  Cons so far 1.No damn compass on the minimap 2.No real way of calling out enemies 3.Balance wise it's poorly done 4.No persistent Open World 5.Only 1 faction against another faction fights  6.Tyranids the PVE content is a huge joke 7.This launch I have just no words for it 8.The Lootboxes are a shity way to try and progress your character anything that has RNG in it SHOULD NOT BE IN THE DAMN PROGRESION 9.THE DEFENDERS SPAWN ON THE DAMN POINT WHEN YOU ARE ATTACKING FROM ALL DIRECTIONS!!!!! who the â¥â¥â¥â¥ had that great idea 10.The stats on the equipment have no info about them like what does toughness do what's better penetration or pure dmg I mean at least the equipment should say what it buffs and what that buff means to the overall character    All in all this game is nowhere near the plans or promises that they made and is a huge disappointment at least for me.  Just to make this clear I have been with this game since Miguel was still leading I got the game day 1 played it since it was available for captain founders and I'm sad to say I do not see this game succeeding...the game has already been labeled a poorly done lobby shooter with bad RNG progression because of the attachments that you can only get from RNG boxes which is just ludicrous esentialy the steam reviews are all negative since launch and I can't blame them .... No1 in their right mind can recommended this game to anyone in it's current state for 40$ when you can just buy overwatch and enjoy a well made lobby shooter
13225	There is no reason for me to approve this game for anyone for its poor current state, If it gets better i will review it then again.  Pros: - W40K aesthetics - Has at least a little amount of dakka - only one of its kind, Space marine is already dead. - No Tau :&gt;  Cons: - Poor servers for EU players - Poor graphic optimization - Really bad graphics for its time. - Clunky controls, especially in melee. - Balance issues - Uncanon choices of design in gameplay(Orks having no actual comparable classes to battle against SM/CSM or eldar. Multimelta/melta acting like a flamethrower what it isin't as its actually a concentrated blast of Energy that melts everything it hits in Space marine relic got this almost right, but its not a wave, its a blast. Massive list of other ones which i'm not listing here). - Lack of flamethrowers, get dem burna boyz!!! - Bad vehicle combat, Bf1942 has respectably better combat with vehicles. - hasty launch - Overpriced for its content at this moment  Some of this cons might get fixed are going te get fixed... i hope. I do enjoy killing time in this, but it gets very dull very fast.
13226	It never got better. That's pretty much all I can say for the game at this point. Still pretty much in an alpha state, none of what was promised originally is really present, and a dwindling player base. What started off as an much anticipated 40K MMO has turned into a lackluster shooter which only the most die hard 40K fans would truely enjoy. Been waiting 3 months for that October update....worthless development team who will mostly likely take the the money and run in the upcoming year. RIP what was a great idea.
13227	Warhammer 40k: eternal balance comming soonÂ®  So i played this game for now 400 hours and decided to write a review. So instead of writting about all the features that are missing or promised, I'm going to write about the now because I don't care about promises and as a gamer who loves his hobby I'm going to be as honest as i can.  first lets get the to the pros (aka the short part) -It's warhammer thats nice -you need to work in a group or you lose -Lootcrates are only buyable through ingame currency   So now to the bad stuff -Melee is completly random for example if someone fast attacks you, you are supposed to D-bash but oh no you weopon broke from doing the right thing and your character is immobile for the next 10 seconds or so looking at the ground like a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ puppy -I never have seen so much server based lag in my life since Vanilla Word of warcraft -they nerfed the ammount of players on maps from 20v20 to 15v15 (big epic fights my â¥â¥â¥) -only 2 type of matches 1. tug of war where you have to cap points to win 2. Fortess where you cap points to win, but with a ticket system -only 7 maps that grow boring pretty quick (I'm looking at you Pegasus) -lackluster customization that is way to expensiv -The ``skill tree`` is boring and uninteresting -you get equipment only through random crates -horrible hit detection (someone hits the wall 5 meters away from you? no he didn't, you are dead now) -The devs rather nerf the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing knife than a op one-hit weopon -Tank are useless even if you are eldar -hope you like to get one-shotted  -Ugly as hell and badly textured   Well rather than go on and on with the negativ aspects I'm going to wrap this up. At this state I cannot recommend this game whats so ever only to big Warhammer 40k fans if they are able to but up with a undeveloped embryo of a game. At the moment it's nothing but a good Framework for a good game and only fun in a group or clan. If it wasn't for my clan i would have abandon this game long ago.
13228	These people spoil the implementation of a great idea. Balance is not. Ranged weapons makes no sense. It all comes down to the melee.Deceived hopes and deception in the money
13229	Do not get this game.  1. Game went from Early Access 'Alpha version' to release. It skipped beta phase completely and went directly from alpha to release...  2. The game costs $50 and it has an in-game cash shop. So not only do you have to grind gear, but if you want you can just spend money too. People compare this to Overwatch, but with Overwatch it's typically VERY EASY to get stuff. Like, one loot crate in Overwatch gets you 5 cosmetic items for sprays, skins, sounds, etc. With this game, theres nothing like that.  3. The game itself is -very- janky. Performance may be spotty, but the main issue is that it basically feels like a third-person alpha version of a Battlefield game. Unfinished, glitchy issues (like the game cuts out sound effects/sounds overlap eachother), and its just...it's a mess. An absolutely mess.  There are more issues, but these are it. Notice how I didn't really talk about things like faction balance or gameplay? Yeah, its because all of that is very shallow at the moment. There is absolutely no reason why you should buy this game at all considering there are absolutely -way- better alternatives out there.  Want a third-persion action game? Play Warframe.  Want a massive battle game? Play Planetside 2.  Want a really awesome Warhammer 40K game? Play Dawn of War 2.  Really, just...not even once.
13230	Thank â¥â¥â¥â¥ I bought the cheapest founders pack for this trash.
13231	It's a complete scam,  Every pre-launch promise has been broken. It's an extremely medicore lobby shooter at this point in time.  Wait a year and come back to it.
13232	Promised: -Open world planetside 2-esque battlefield -Hero classes -Elite classes -Faction War Councils of specialist hero player units that lead the factions and set objectives etc -Extensive wargear and specialization -Free to Play feature where free to players would play as Ork boys, giving Orks a numerical advantage in game -Epic open world strategy territory control where Faction Councils spend resources, partake in battles &amp; order special weapons for squads; Tyranids clusters can attack bases diverting players to defend territory  Delivered 3-4 years later: -Bare bones -Instanced battles (open world cut) -Limited wargear (maybe 20-30 weapons across all factions with the same functions respectively) -Clunky movement -Clunky gameplay -Graphics average in 2014 -Free to Waaagh completely cut -Heroe &amp; Elite classes completely cut (there are Veteran classes which are the exact same model as regular except they have slightly more room to equip items thus being slightly beefier, but it feels cheap)  At this rate it needs at least 2 more years of hard development before it becomes what it should have been on launch. It plays like a late alpha of Gears of War 3.
13233	I have watched this game for a while now and its basically dead. I played it when it was early access and during the Access the frame rate is terrible you will constantly get Lag spikes and the Range weapons are unbalanced and Melee is completely broken its boring when fighting another Melee opponent because you clash weapons and wait for one you to pull off a parry or wait for a teammate to kill them but parrying is bad because it's hard to see what's going on with the Lag and terrible optimization the graphics are poor meshes look awful. I have been on and off this game to see what they have changed since launch its now December and its the same old, same old the frame rate is still terrible and it's just all around broken and I'm giving up on this game because the Dev haven't done anything they keep adding more pointless â¥â¥â¥â¥ instead of fixing the game's main problems. It's a shame I had really high hopes, but the games was just not ready to be launched at all they should at least had one more year.  If you're thinking of buying this game don't its sadness in a game
13234	Was promised Ps2 Warhammer without mircotransactions, but got H&amp;G Warhammer with heavy Mircotransactions... I wasted $120...
13235	In its current state, it's not worth it's asking price. I'm going to keep the game because i have strong faith that they will fix things over time like balance, lag interaction and various glitches but if i was someone that didnt gave the game, i'd not buy it, follow it and wait
13236	Just. Stay. Away.  I was denied a refund, probably because I bought it in early access and played a few hours.  This product is unfinished, unbalanced and unpolished. It is poorly optimised. It is buggy.  This game was built on broken promises. Sure, they had to release the game early for whatever â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t reason they decide to give us - it doesn't mean they should be forgiven for it. Why release an unfinished game for FORTY QUID?
13237	Absoulte sellouts. Unbalanced beyond playable.
13238	 Early Access Review
13239	This is the first time I've ever been motivated enough to post a review.  This game suffers from poor balancing, bad map design, poor mechanics and very very poor teaching.  If you are anything but a space marine, you will feel outgunned, outarmoured and you will spend all your time wondering why 3 continuous seconds of shooting at a target will not damage it in the slightest, and if you are shot at, well get used to the respawn screen. The only thing going for this game is the WH40k IP.   It's like they haven't ever played it themselves, let alone got it tested.   2/10 stars. I want a refund
13240	They â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up.
13241	To keep it short:  Not much else to add to all the other reviews but.. even the senior producer himself said that if you're on the fence about this game, you should wait rather than buy now.  I can only agree with that.
13242	This game being released came as a total surprise to me. When I played it two weeks ago before the release it still played very much like an alpha version. I figured I'd try again in a few months to see if it had improved. Then suddenly I heard it was being released as a finished game. I assume they ran out of funding.  But, I think fewer people will buy this as a finished product. At least if you buy it as alpha you have hope of real improvements.  Basic performance is still very poor. And the game looks completely unfinished. It's more like a tech demo, and not a very innovative one at that.
13243	The controls/combat feels like an pre-alpha version of the original Gears of War(2006) but with even more movement bugs/control issues than even that. WH40k universe is amazing but this game is not even remotly worth the price currently.  This is more of a $10 terribly done gears of war clone with wh40k skins right now.  Has the potential to be fun, but not there yet.  Pros: Looks good Sounds good.  Cons: Everything else Plays like â¥â¥â¥â¥, like controlling tanks from early 1990's games Price
13244	So...I've never really played an arena battle game before, but I like WH40K, and it looked really cool so I gambled FIFTY DOLLARS to see if I would like it. I've played Eternal Crusade for a few days, and I really, REALLY want my money back.   It could be that I'm just not used to the fast pace of a shooter game like this, and that inexperience made playing Eternal Crusade more frustrating than it needs to be. A typical skirmish game would go something like this: Run from the spawn point to the battle, get killed immediately by a higher level player, repeat. Most often I would never even see the attack that killed comming, It got really boring, really aggrivating, really fast. The last time I logged in to this game I had more fun driving an ork battle wagon around the training grounds, seeing what kinds of stunts I could do, instead of playing the game.   If you are a really esperienced shooter game player, and you have lots of friends that would like to join your team, You might like Eternal Crusade. But if you are a casual player who prefers solo play (Like me), then stay away from this game.
13245	Can be good.  Isn't good.  If you expect warhammer 40k's answer to planetside!?,, dont..  Also they begged people to give good reviews so â¥â¥â¥â¥ them!  http://forum.eternalcrusade.com/threads/this-is-a-message-for-all-warhammer40k-fans.57370/     
13246	This game is not what was promised, and is a far cry from what it could be, intially promised as an mmo, it is now a basic lobby shooter, not only did it fail to live up to expectations, but it greedily expects you to pay more then even its asking price on a cash shop to get the best armor and weaponry, if that wasnt enough, even basic cosmetic changes cost actual cash.  The gameplay itself is utterly broken, ranged weapons feel incredibly weak, and melee weapons are near instant kills, races are largely unbalanced, in particular, Eldar posses a major advantage, online play feels like a chore and is painfully unfair to players who dont have the money to spend on a handful of high powered weapons(Pay to win if ive ever seen it) and finally, the games appearance is downright pathetic, it has little in the way of graphical polish and feels incomplete.  Overall, steer clear of this hot mess, this game is downright garbage, and honestly, if i could, id demand my money back.
13247	Followed this game since its announcement. Many a day spent hyping over the ideas of personalised ships, good melee combat, progression, customisation, intense combat, bombardments, armoured warfare and all of this between multiple factions.  This was not delivered.  This problem is completely with the developers. The forums, which many many people contributed too with idea, problems and solutions must have been mainly ignored.   Also pay2waagh is a very real thing. Prepare for microtransactions, immediately marks this game as money making over actual player satisfaction.  Melee has been an issue since alpha and they never bothered fixing it. Its horrendous, its a spam fest, it isn't honestly melee imo, just whoever is the melee class and clicks faster.  Don't buy unless circumstances change majorly. But for that to happen you're better off waiting for a different game as i doubt this will change enough.
13248	It will be finished in the year 40K
13249	  It's unfortunately not very good. Aside from the fact that it's not an MMO as advertised, but just a lobby based shooter, the combat is bad. Everything is jumpy, and not in the way lag produces, but more due to bad animations; aiming, melee, really everything is awkward. It's like they skipped half the frames for each action leading to everything feeling strange and unplayable. This is all at 60fps by the way.  It should be free to play since it already has microtransactions. I'd have refunded if I didn't get it for free.
13250	If you are an Aussie player, dont rush out and get this.  Until they release a half decent server, the net code will be your worse enemy, and it is not fun at this stage.  Alpha ran alot better and it was smoother. Some how they have managed to make it worse :(  If they announce a Asia Server, then I would be alot more interested, but since playing from Alpha, this game has been going down hill in proformance   Also I am worried about the shop. I have a feeling the title will be P2W (just from what I have seen thus far)
13251	As a lifelong fan of 40K, it pains me to write a bad review of this game. I bought into the founders preorder so that I may begin to play this game during development. Each update I would log into to try and play but I would find that the controls remains sloppy, the over the shoulder view just plain sucks and it contributes to the games poor feel and bad controls. It was just unplayable for me. A game should not require hours of play just to get used to the movement controls and cover system.    The concept could be great but they really need to go to a first person view.   The maps are so messy, dark and lack atmosphere you can barely see the enemy. It feels like a poorly made mod of the game Space Marine from a few years ago. with worse controls.   
13252	Warhammer 40,000 Eternal Crusade is an Early-Access game that has launched, from what i can only assume, a drunken mistake at the office party from accidently leaning on the big 'ol 'Launch on Steam' button, because i'm sure no manager would actually release their product in this state.  The Framerate is wildly tempermental (980ti, 5930k, 16gb of RAM) Barely holding 60 frames in some scenes, with an all-low of 28FPS on some maps where most of the scenery is present in the players view, though how they have managed this is impressive, considering the game looks considerably dated as is.  Animations in the game are wildly different on quality, you can tell for example, that the focus of the work done to the Marines seems to be considerably more that was spend on the Orks and Eldar, also another insight into this being a reason is they have considerably less cosmetics that you can buy with your hard-earned money, because after spending your money to buy the game, you can ofcourse, choose to spend more.  Physics are janky, Robes on the Eldar for example often just flap wildly everywhere, and sometimes through itself, Animations don't always line up, for example while crouching and turning the model's hands did not move with the rest of the body, resulting in a hovering gun and an odd pose.  Sound effects are also wildly different, while selecting different Psyker powers, you get a 1980's tv 'Woosh' sound that feels like it was probably procured from a stock sound website, while some sounds feel considerably more beefy. On the subject of sounds, Pity the headphone user, for when a sound effect goes off on an execution it is significantly louder than the rest of the game.  Shooting mechanics felt reasonably tight, though the feedback of if you were hitting a target or not was non-present and sometimes left you wondering if the server was lagging, as TTK felt like a dice roll at every encounter, this problem may possibly get stronger as the game progresses, as unlocks can help facilitate extra survivability.  All in all, this could be a good game at some point if they focus on making the game more responsive and having a quality thats much more consistant accross the game, as for right now i'd reccomend you save your money but keep an eye on it, as for me, i'm refunding this and putting the money towards more minatures, as in it's current state i don't think it's of a quality that should be expected of a final product.
13253	No oceana servers, half of the weapons that were promised arent implemented, game advertises 'thousands' of weapons when there is a total of about 30 to a faction (including reskins) the game has basically just been rushed out the door and is completely unfinished with tonnes of bugs and awful animations, oh and don't forget that this game has set up a cash shop then the devs decided to scrap f2p and keep the pay2win shop edit: apparently being able to buy modded guns without having to unlock anything isn't pay2win also there are oceana servers that not even the devs know exist
13254	I was hoping for some epic combat. Instead we got a very generic shooter that isnt quite balanced. Accuracy is off, all of the enemies seem to one or two shot you (even though as a space marine you may be a genetically engineer angel of death). Could have been great, instead its an insult to the emperor
13255	The game should be finished first and then sold. or stay in early acces. but this is simply a game that is not done yet. Laggin Melee and the gameplay is stuttering all together.  you are dead already before you know you are.   I am a founder as well of this game but they should make it a whole lot smoother.
13256	Now, don't take my not recommending as me disliking the game.  Far from it, I personally enjoy the game, but I wouldn't recommend it right now.  Pros: There's a fair bit of balance between melee and ranged combat, which is something that's pretty important for a 40K game, and both systems feel pretty solid, though the melee could use a bit of fine tuning still. Both PVP and PVE elements in the game, and they're both fun to play with. The game looks fairly good. Certainly no Witcher 3, but considering there can be dozens of players in a single game, it's pretty decent looking. 40K.  Cons: A lot of features are missing. The open world element is completely canned, Actually conquering territories is no more. Among a few other things. Balance issues, Eldar feel immenselve overpowered, and Space Marines feel slightly underpowered. Glitches. There are glitches, stuttering issues, sound problems galore. Way more than there should be considering it was in Early Access so long. The dreaded word all gamers hate: Microtransactions (Granted, they're cosmetic, but they're still loathesome.)  Now does that mean the game is necessarily bad? Not in my opinion. I find the game to be a good bit of fun, not something to sit down and play for hours upon hours, but something to hop in, playing a couple of matches, then hop off. As I said, the combat is fun, and the 40K aspect certainly does add some charm to it.  But, I do NOT think it's worth the money in its current state. $50 is to much for a buggy game that's been stripped of many of its promised features. Now, the developers did say that they would implement at least some of these features as time goes on, but if that is true, then best to simply wait for it. By then, the game will be more complete, polished, or at least have a bit of a price drop.  TL;DR: Not worth it for now, wait for a while, then pick it up.
13257	Didn't they promise a Planetside 2-like game with huge Battles and PvPvE elements? Because this game is nothing but a half-â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Space Marine multiplayer with microtransactions.
13258	Developers have lied and half delivered on what they said the game would be. PVE elements aren't even stable and there are no MMO elements to the game whatsoever.
13259	Hello dear developers. Please see here :)   http://store.steampowered.com/app/298900/ 
13260	Unfortunatly I had taken a ride on the hype train by being a founder. Been playing it off and on in alpha up until now. I so wish this thing was great, but it has just been a dissapointment overal.  The IP is solid and they do a great job of making it very 40K. A big thumbs up on that point, but past that the game is just chocked full of performance issues and glitches. They might have been rushed or had some other technical problems they faced, the end result is a mostly unplayable experience. The control is cumbersom and clunky and refresh rate looke like it is being drawn by an etch-a-sketch. Very unoptimized to say the least.  I should have just saved my money and bought more 40K tabletop stuff instead.
13261	Note: This is from the view of someone who plays almost exclusively the tactical, traitor, dire avenger, and shoota boy  Warhammer 40k Eternal Crusade, I really wanted it to be a great game but it is not. On the release date the servers were great no lag to note of, now the game has continous lag making firefights a sever issue. Second RNG loot crates in a fully released, fully priced game for not cosmetics, but actual weapon improvements and modifications that make setting up a loadout painful. Finally the devs cannot bring balance to this game with their current mindset. In the current state 1 faction (orcs) is blatently insane with their incredibly high health, another fairly strong (Eldar) with high agility and close range capability while the other two (chaos and loyalist) are left with their rears hanging in the wind.
13262	Started this Beta about a year ago - I really don't see much improvement since then. Other than the Warhammer 40k themes this game really doesn't have any feeling or life to it - very flat basic team shooter. Far from the MMO I supported last fall.   I regret putting money into this beta and I would not recommend anyone pay for this game which in its current state should be a Free-to-play.
13263	The other players have been surprisingly fun and entertaining but the gameplay is mediocre. Considering that most of the combat in this game is 3rd person shooting or melee I am very surprised that the PC controls have not been improved since early access. Aiming around corners is extremely difficult given the odd camera angles relative to your weapon. Additionally it was very frustrating to have to purchase weapons before being able to try them out in the Garrison area only to then discover that the weapon I chose to try was terrible for me. I'm sure the devs have been working hard on this game but as a player none of those changes are visible to me since I last played early access. I'm not even remotely upset about the released game being radically different from what was hyped, the game is simply just not polished enough to be fun.
13264	This is still Beta right? Right?... No?... Well, holy â¥â¥â¥â¥. I played the Betaâ¦ I just played the release clientâ¦  I had a hard time spotting the difference. Starting with the more obvious.. The lag. For a TPS this is one of the First issues that should ever be dealt with. There is a big delay between clicking your mouse button, your gun actually firing, and impacts being applied. The upshot is, most of the ranged combat falls into âSpray and prayâ. Movement?.. in some cases, the movement isnt too bad. In other cases, the movement is just so awkward and clunky (still). Its too easy to end up rolling out into the open when you were really just trying to strafe the corner. Or during a melee attack your toon bolts forward at where the Enemy âisâ only to âmissâ because thats not where the enemy is when the animation finished . Lots of work to be done with the Vehicles also. Theres a shade of BF2 with the Vehicles, you remember Karkand and the APCs?... Yea, thats in here....  Ballanceâ¦ there is none. If you start a level 1 noob toon.. Expect to be staring at the spawn screen a lot. Chances are you are going to be slaughtered in a single go with someone wielding a powered-melee weapon. Repeatedly.  There is no room for tacticsâ¦ This is a true TPS but there is far more weight in the close combatâ¦ Although, close combat itself is unpolishedâ¦ Most of the time, as I mentioned, you are going to be dealing with 1 hit attacks that leave you either dead, down, or stunned unable to do Anything. (depending on your class, there are Storm shields that bring the Laughable gameplay of the Counter Strike Riot Shields into this game) Thats when you make it into a map.. I played 6 games tonight.. Technically, I think I played about 10.. But, the server dropped me before the map loaded about 4 time and I was forced to close the application and load up from scratch again. There were also the 3 occasions that I was ejected from the queue for âfailing to respond to the serverââ¦. Now, we could suggest that its my connection, but since this is currently the Only game in my library that displays this behaviour, Im going to say its the servers, or Id be seeing disconnects and lag in the myriad of other online games I play. If you are looking for an MMORPG set in the Warhammer 40k Universe, this Is Not It (at the moment)â¦ This is a TPS, Action Combat Game with character progressionâ¦ Im actually really disappointed, I wanted to like this gameâ¦..â¦ But its just not finished, and it didn't turn into the game that was originally pitched, which I had really high hopes for.
13265	Pay attention to the reviews before purchasing this game, all I have to say.
13266	  DISCLAIMER: I recieved this key for free   On their site the devs are telling people 'to make possitive reviews or non at all' because they want people to spend their money on the game even though its horrifically overpriced.  The game is nowhere near done, as they haven't even optimized the net code yet. There are tons of bugs: -guns not firing -hits not registering -guns will stop fiing for no reason -melee cancels all gun charging and fire animations (even if you already fire) -the melee system is broken and is literally swing to win  -melee will ignore dmg and even phase through shots when they charge -eldar melee is so broken its insane, if you see one coming towards you its over -guns do everything from no dmg at all to somehow oneshoting people -some anti vehicle weapons do nothing against vehicles -charge weapons can be easily interupted just by getting hit or moving your character -defend maps can be almost impossible to win in some cases because of the time you have to hold and how far away they are from each other -spawning is terrible and totally random in some cases, you can spawn in the middle of your enemies or be spawned in a totally different spawn point -getting 'stuck' on terrain is a reall problem -animations for actions can take so long you will die before you can defend yourself -melee lock on means you don't even have to be looking at who you are attacking to charge or hit them -team dmg means that the player using aoe weapons has a high chance of killing their own teamates -rounds do not actually come from the gun barrel, but spawn in front of the weapon...... and to the left,,, and right..... or above the gun..... or from below it. Basically you don't know where your shot will come from which makes aiming hard. -spawning takes around 3-4 seconds before you can move, and this makes spawn killing super easy, when one can set up in a window over a spawn and kill the entire team over and over, especially if its their only spawn left and they can do nothing to stop it.  There are truck loads more wrong but I'm not going to make an essay of this.  This game was supposed to be an MMO style but it is now a third person lobby shooter. Over all this game is not done by a long shot and the MMO that was promised and used to sell the game will most likely never come to pass, there is so much wrong and its obvious they released early because they needed the money. I hope they follow through and begin to quickly role out the updates but with so many screw the consumer games that have came out I will not be holding my breath. I honestly don't want to play it anymore until the updates come, because it is ruining the game for me and I'm tired of failed 40k games.  The $50 price tag on this game is a joke, and I don't get how they though what is basically still an aplha or beta game (yea its fully released) was worth this much money when you could get the new Deus Ex game instead.   What really smells of crap is the fact that they have not offered to refund the founders who sank tons of money into a lie and will most likely never see the game they supported.  If they actually do something my review will change to reflect that but as of now I don't see this game surviving very long, especially with Gothic Armada already out and a great game and DW3 and Deathwing coming out very soon. So I say spend your money on one of those games. And don't thing I'm going to overlook MICROTRANSACTIONS IN A FULL PRICE GAME!!! I DO NOT ADIVISE PURCHASING THIS GAME!!!
13267	 Early Access Review
13268	Ashamed to have convinced my friends to purchase this game.
13269	dont buy this peace of â¥â¥â¥â¥, this game is far away from beeing ready for release the game mechanics are brocken, the balance ist a joke and the servers are laggy.  
13270	I have given the game multiple chances in varying instances of gameplay. While it can be fun, the game HAD good promises at the start, and at the very best i can say that. Now i just HOPE my money was not wrongfully spent on some â¥â¥â¥â¥ shooter with a 40k skin on it. My suggestion? MAYBE wait until a game changing update is rolled out.
13271	The game is still very unfinished for an AAA-price tag and feels rushed. So many features which have been promised by the developers are still missing and propably never will be implemented. The straw that breaks the camels back for me is the ridiculous pricing on additional weapons and cosmetics.   Overall, I can't recommend that game.
13272	I waited for this game for so long, ever since it was announced way back when. Finally I spotted it on sale like a month ago and it said it wasn't in beta or anything anymore, it was a full, released, finished game. So naturally I went ahead and bought it.  They lied.  I'm a big 40K fanboy and really wanted this game to work. It disappointed me to no end when it turned out it is just a big pile of technical issues, latency problems and unresponsive and numb gameplaywise. There is literally no reason why this should be out of beta yet. I did not pay to become your beta tester. Browsing the forums it seems most of the issues have persisted for quite a while now, so either the developers lack the skills to fix them or they are just ignoring many of the problems, neither of which is exactly a great thing.  Don't waste your money. If you absolutely must have to have it, at least wait for a few months until it may be even remotely playable. Right now it's a huge pile of steaming, wasted potential.  
13273	In a nutshell: A poorly done version of an EA Battlefield game with a Warhammer background. But its not just poor, its lousy.   How they can release this game at this point is beyond me. It's clunky controls, poor graphics and subpar animations. It has none or few of the features that were promised.  My recommendation: Do NOT purchase this game. Not even for the Warhammer40K-theme. You WILL be disapointed.
13274	 Early Access Review
13275	broken promises extremly slow dev....   bad optimalisation balance - whats that?  shoter? - nope at all ... melee spam + plazma spam maps few are oke, other unbalanced.... extremly unbalanced.... are devs doing something about it? well they say so... but no reasults... at all...since long time this game is beta... for full price... with expensive microtransactions in it???!!!  this game is same disapointed as 'no mans sky' but WH 40k edition...   but if you have 'to much money' and bored for one - max two days... and you are extreme fan of warhammer 40k then but only then you coudl buy it...  so sad... big expectation - total disapointment  
13276	Just a â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. Do not buy it at all! 
13277	I wish I could put a mixed review, but for the time being I will have to say I do not recommend this game. There's still quite a bit of lag and balancing issues. Melee combat is nearly broken entirely, and gameplay in general is clunky. Microtransactions are also included, though most of it is cosmetic (however, some are for very unbalanced weapons/gear). Not only that, but we were also promised PvE gameplay against Tyranids, and a world map similar to that of Planetside 2. Right now, it's more akin to a Battlefield or Battlefront game as it has set maps, objectives, and lobbies rather than open-world play, or the presence of multiple factions on one field like PS2. I was very excited for this game, but some of the glaring issues and content left out turns me off a bit. All that being said, content is (hopefully) going to be added somewhere down the line, and the game can be fairly entertaining. I wouldn't say that the problems with this game, apart from microtransactions, can't be fixed later though, so if you can find it cheap online or on sale, I'd say jump on it. However, it's not quite worth $50 USD yet, so your best bet is to wait until it's updated. It's not a finished game.
13278	This is my first review, I will try and illustrate the game's elements and the promises that were made years ago, and compare them to what we have now.    Original Game Concept
13279	No, bad game, state of the game? Remember planetside 2 at its most bugged, laggy and broken state, then literally square that and add lag from Aus to US east.
13280	I've never felt compelled to write a game review in the 11 years of my Steam account, until now. This game is so bad I feel obligated to do my part in making this game more hated than no man's sky.  This is objectively the worst video game released in 2016, and arguably in recent memory. The melee combat is clunky, unpredictable, and objectively broken. Certain races (Orks) are objectively better at it, and there is no escaping a space marine with an assault shield and a power sword because of how broken melee combat is.  You cannot interact with guild members in any meaningful way. At all. You can see who is online in your guild, but you can't send them messages, or chat in a guild window. I guess it's OK knowing who is online in my guild that I can't play with. Good job, behaviour.  There is no voice chat. Hey, behaviour, do you understand that when counter strike 1.6 was released in 2003 it supported fully integrated voice communication? That was 13 years ago, and you've released this game with less functionality and guild support than an FPS from 13 years ago. Hell, even EverQuest had a chat box at least. Get your â¥â¥â¥â¥ together, behaviour. I can't join a party. When I saw the 'Warparties' button I thought, Oh alright here we go. I'll join a party of other chaos players, and we'll queue together and get to know each other. Hell, maybe one of them has a mumble or TS, because this trash can game sure doesn't. I was confused for about 3 days when I never saw a single warparty. Seems I was mistaken on the warparty; it's a list of people from your steam friends list.  That's right. Unless your poor friends have purchased what is objectively The Worst video game ever released, you can't socialize with anybody. Your only option is to click BATTLE NOW and hope you get to play with some people who aren't the dregs of the community. (Here's a hint: they are.)  To recap, the incompetent development team (which I believe is 16 â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ people?) has released, in the year of our Emperor 2016 what can only be accurately described as an alpha game without the following basic social support features: A group system that allows players to form groups, parties, or platoons/warbands. That is unless you use them from your literal steam friends list. There is 1 other person on my friends list who has this game. Oh wait never mind he just uninstalled lol good for him.  A functional voice chat system. Try coordinating anything in a lobby FPS with chat. It â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sucks. Zero reason to join a guild. I mean what the â¥â¥â¥â¥? The whole point of a guild is to join forces and play with people, but we've been given ZERO ability to do even that. You have no means to send tells to guild mates, chat in a guild chat, invite guild members to war parties. There is not even basic functionality!  You could say I'm mad at video games. I paid $50 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dollars for this mess, and I have a well founded right to be â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off about the lack of basic functions, the broke â¥â¥â¥â¥ melee, the inability to accurately aim down sights, the lack of balance, the list goes on! The development team ought to hide their faces in shame for this schlock. And don't tell us to 'Stick around! Updates are coming!' â¥â¥â¥â¥ you.  I wish there were two thumb down buttons because I can't condemn this game enough. I do hope this game fails and fails hard.
13281	I had the hope for a open world game like Planetside 2 but got Battlefield in space. The game is released but feel like closed beta where you have to pay to enter. There is so much missing or not really working it is really sad. There is also no real balance. Hope they work on the game and then I can recommend it.
13282	Clunky game mechanics, not very fun. Overall feels botched.
13283	BUYER BEWARE: There is an effort on the Eternal Crusade forums to encourage owners to positively rate this game on steam to mislead potential buyers. Please pay no attention to the current steam rating as it is false.  I became a founder for Eternal Crusade back in 2013. I sorely regret this decision.  Eternal Crusade is the rushed, bare bones, barely playable release after &gt;3 years of troubled development from no-name developer Behaviour Interactive. The game's founders were promised the stars by a man named Miguel Caron, the now ex-creative director for the title. The original promises are well known at this stage, so I won't repeat them here. One day on one of the dev's weekly streams, Miguel announced out of the blue that he was leaving the company. He didn't explain why. Later, the community discovered that all his promises were impossible, while a number of key staff left during this period.   Currently, the game is somewhat equivalent to THQ's Space Marine, except worse in every aspect. Yes Eternal Crusade has 32 vs 32 matches compared to 8 vs 8, but the game is missing critical functionality and content. Many assets are still clearly placeholder, such as vehicle models and handling, many sound effects, and even animations. There are only 3 maps and 1 game mode. There are only 2 vehicle types (Predator and Rhino). Controls are clunky and feel horribly rough and unrefined, making close combat a frenzied and unresponsive button mash. The game is eclipsed by THQ's Space Marine, which in comparison had superb combat and level design, a good singleplayer campaign and a fun coop survival mode.   Actual gameplay is an epilepsy-inducing slog. The environments in the game currently are horribly dull, as the talented lead level designer (Steven Lumpkin) was one of the key staff members to leave during 'The Snake Oil incident'. You will find yourself slogging it across gravel and concrete terrains, fighting in poorly lit and poorly designed mimicries of 40K gothic architecture. You will often have trouble discerning what is actually happening due to incredibly poor lighting. The amount of camera shake and blinding special effects in Eternal Crusade would make Michael Bay blush.   The alleged global map is a non-feature. The trailers for this game boast about how the various races in the game fight for territory. In reality, there's less to it than even the campaign game mode for Red Orchestra 2. There are no end-goals and no rewards, it inherits the same problems you see in PlanetSide 2 although its without any of the benefits.  Netcode is a disaster, as is the hitreg. What doesn't help is the fact that there exist no EU or SEA servers, the only servers are hosted somewhere in the NA region, and they dislike performing well. Amusingly, the scoreboard will spoof your ping. Allegedly I had 40 ping when I was in my last game, and I live in the UK. One of my squad mates was from Colorado, and his ping was roughly 50 to 60. Unless the server is in the deep Atlantic, I think something is wrong.  The community is split between several factions: The bitten veterans of the community, the rabid fanboys that would make your average Biodrone envious of such â¥â¥â¥â¥ posting, and a large sect of fairly new members who are either similarly disappointed with the game like the vets or are regular players. Community managers have recently engaged in censoring posts that make light of balance issues and prevalent game problems. Older, more well-known members seem to be the exception to being silenced as many have been around since the beginning, and have attracted a following or reputation.  Please note that my low number of hours on record is irrelavent due to the fact that the game was around long before it was on Steam and long before hours were logged for this particular title. I have amounted roughly 65+ hours in the alpha.   I'm a 40K neckbeard. I love the 40K universe and I fully engage in the tabletop hobby. Overcoming love for the universe reveals this game for what it truly is: A lacklustre, clunky, boring experience, with little longevity, and a vastly inflated price tag for what you actually get, sickeningly paired with scum-level MICROTRANSACTIONS (the type that sell you too much or too little funbux for what you want).  Edit #1: It turns out there are no EU servers and the ping you see in the scoreboard is entirely false. There are only US servers available.  Edit #2: I was asked why I didn't talk about the global map. It's because it's barely a feature.
13284	if you enjoy playing horribly optimized, unpolished, and unbalanced free to play games but also enjoy wasting money on garbage products than have i got a deal for you!
13285	The Codex Astartes does not support this game.  Please do not buy this. DONT.   I know, you're a 40k fan. You finally get to play as orks, and those fancy space elves, but don't.   This game is a shell of what it should be. The melee system is broken. The gunplay is medoicre. Every match is riddled with bugs and gliches. The racial balance is a joke. Orks are more or less bullet proof and the eldar can one-shot a marine. There is no customization. You cannot change your appearance without paying (real $) for parts, and cannot even change your character's color scheme. The item 'customization' is based off of mods that you obtain randomly, meaning you may never get a basic upgrade that makes other players significantly more powerful (like lifedrain melee...no really wtf?!). There isn't a large selection of weapons, and most act like a rock, paper, sissors match (fist beats sword, melta beats vehicle, etc. (no really a freaking melta gun is pretty much useless even at close range against anthing other than a vehicle)) To make is worse, the community is terrible. Every game is either filled with aggrovated players lamenting how thier bolters deal less damage than a knife, or intolerable fanboys who scream 'Waah' 'for the emporer' or 'skulls to khorne' and become millitant if you criticize thier beloved exercise in insanity that is this game.  Don't get me wrong, I love 40k. but this game isn't what is advertise. It's a shame too because I really wanted to like this game.
13286	Trying to become a decent game but failing miserably which is kinda sad. It gets updates, patches... sure yet still not really passed the optimization very well. Give it 6 more months to buy it THEN MAYBE YOU MIGHT GET A DECENT GAME.  Well I said 6 months, â¥â¥â¥â¥ that actually give this 3 years or so. Development is so slow for a professionel team like this. I should get it when it literally took 6 months to implant Iron Warriors, Space Wolves and other â¥â¥â¥â¥.   Game is laggy as â¥â¥â¥â¥, there are no EU servers, has â¥â¥â¥â¥ ton of missing content, POORLY BALANCED and many more.  Wanna pay 10 dolars for a â¥â¥â¥â¥ shoulder pad? THEN THIS GAME IS FOR YOU! You are saying you already paid for that content? Well f.uck you then because we will sell those armor pieces anyway. This is not a F2P game but sure we act like one!  I'm not recommanding this to anyone yet due to â¥â¥â¥â¥ ton of problems it has.
13287	Update - f2p now confirmed as being worked on.  Re-Review: 26/12/1016  I think fairly that at this point in time two things are fairly obvious:  1.The game will not change drastically or meaningfully in the future.   It is pretty much the same as the pre release alpha. The 3 content patches before years end ended up being one with it consisting of cosmetic changes and bugfixes. So that is a couple of maps, bug fixes and cosmetic items since launch. The 'barebones basic' campaign system has not been released. (8+ delays according to some) Now some would say why even give a deadline if they never keep them, my answer would be what the hell would they even talk about as that has been the 'goto' answer for refuting complaints and questions about barebones development and upcoming content since launch.  There is obviously some kind of problem going on that is not known to the public. No doubt it will be aired later. Lack of personnel? Ability? Hands tied by publisher? Focused on console release while pc is given lip service? We can only speculate at this point.  2. It will eventually go f2p.  Pretty much inevitable. Its tanked on PC in its current state. Future new players will have a tough time. Due to the low pop the matchmaker will put you up against organised guilds full of heavily invested (time and money wise) backers, who are kitted out, on a regular basis and at some times of day exclusively.  Guild tags were dropped from the inmatch scoreboard strangely and seem to reappear sporadically. Once you get to know the usual guild names you will still know when its a guild match which causes a player quit revolt.  I suspect all the dev time is focused on their future console launch which will no doubt keep the publisher off the back until its launched. Then it will be a countdown to f2p.  I think if your content to play the game as is, as a lobby shooter with a 40k skin for a frankly absurd price youll be happy. Try to get it on sale tho, their have now been two, one for 66% on a daily. This will marginally take the sting out after you have played for a while.  A few final points, at this time, right now - There are p2w weapons, an ingame store, no ingame way to earn rtc(ingame real money currency) but they managed to find the time to put in a mechanism to buy it and no eu servers (my ping is in region of 230 usually) which probably will not change until (a successful) f2p happens.  Below is part of the original review from launch which is all relevant (apart from some added real money cosmetics) to now as basically nothing has changed: /shrug  'BUYER BEWARE':  MASSIVELY OP -  http://massivelyop.com/2016/10/05/launch-impressions-of-warhammer-40000-eternal-crusade-part-two/   'The idea that someone, presumably a person in a position of authority within the studio â or publisher, as the case may be â took even a cursory look at the current state of Eternal Crusade and said, âYeah, thatâs ready for launch,â is frankly inconceivable.'  'Calling the state of the current game 'rough' is akin to saying that a forest fire is a just a bit toasty.'  ANGRYJOE -  https://www.twitch.tv/angryjoeshow/v/91400775  Start at 53 minutes in. Covers a lot of what is not there, the state of the game, game mechanics and the ingame store.  In the words of joe - ' I love this game, I love this concept, but what has been done here is contempt, its contemptible'  'It is so barebones'  MMORPG -  http://www.mmorpg.com/warhammer-40k-eternal-crusade/reviews/the-incomplete-crusade-1000000459   'They say in the future there is only war. If Eternal Crusade is the future then god emperor on the golden throne help us all because we are doomed.'  'No if, ands, or buts about it. This just isnât a finished game.'  '$49.99 for this is about 5 times what is should cost.'  TOTALBISCUIT -  (YouTube Video: The Co-Optional Podcast Ep. - September 29th, 2016)   'Its so lazy and dull I cant even summon up criticism for it'   'Its just a really boring 3rd person shooter with warhammer characters in it'  What is it? A very barebones w40k skinned lobby shooter. It has minimal customisation to none for some classes, an unbalanced melee/ranged system which is also poorly designed and implemented. It is vastly overpriced for what it is and what is there. It has a pointless lockbox upgrades system and ingame store which can only make you assume f2p is on the horizon in the future. An rmt system that prices items in such a way that you need to buy two lots of credit to get them not one. A placeholder advancement screen. A campaign map which is currently pointless. They changed the infographic detailing what was in the game just after launch, a highly deceptive practise. No FOV slider. (on a pc release!! with one of the worst console style fov default views I have ever experienced) I could go on and on.  No doubt confidence in the release quality of the title was low hence the short sighted high price grab. This view is only strengthened by the low level of communication on the official forums/steam to quell the uproar over this release. No information or comments have been made by the devs or community manager in direct relation to the abyssmal launch state and the many questions raised as a result in the official forums/steam since launch, as many players have commented on. And so paying customers can only speculate. I think they have decided to bunker down and ride it out as anything said would probably be seized upon. Or maybe they cant? (namco bandai) who knows. We sure dont...  Quite simply if your money means anything to you dont support this practise, it is quite frankly unfinished and light years away from being worth even half of its asking price and thats if the promised content continues into the future with what looks to be a small niche community. Wait for a deep sale.  Edit - Clarity.
13288	The game is too broken to be bought at full price, or half price, or heavily discounted free price. Too many technical issues such as poor networking, colision detection problems (I'm a space marine that can't jump over a diagonal knee high wall....), gameplay design problems ( someone explain to me the benefits of stunning anyone as a heavy weapons marine), (melees auto target/instakill you while you try to desperately roll away or stun them in vain), range weapons heavily underperform against melees (You can literally count 8-10 HB rounds smashing into a CSM, only to have them autolock onto you and mow you down with melee), Lascannons takes over an entire minute of use to actually down a vehicle (that's like 6-8 shots with charging and recharging times). Just overall, this game is a frustrating mess that creates more stress than relieves it.  |The PVE is unreliable. Too many times would our entire teams play experience be thrown away due to a tyranid spawnig somewhere inaccessible and we cannot continue on. The time runs out and we lose. When that happens enough, people quit, and last I looked, their was less than 600 people playing.  If I wasn't busy with real life, I would have taken the opportunity to get the refund they offered. Alas, here I am with a broken mess of a game I wished would have worked.
13289	If you're looking for a balanced, polished game...this isn't for you. If you want a basic (very basic) lobby shooter, with serious balance issues and a fast dwindling player base, well here you go. As a founder, I could complain about everything all the other founders have, but that would be a bit repetitive. And quite frankly, I'm not entirely sure the developers care, or if they do they can't do anything about it as they have people they report. About the only thing I'll say, as I'm sure many other other founders will agree, is that this should still be early access or at best in a beta stage.   I'm a long time 40K fan, and as much as I love 40K and have hopes for this game still, save your money (wait for it to go on sale if it ever does) as it's not worth it in it's current carnation.
13290	Game feels very incomplete, I've been keeping up with this game a bit more than I've played it by my hours logged, but you can just look at the amount of negative reviews that go deeper into how unbalanced and clunky this game is.  I bought into this game's early access based on false promises and my own stupidity.  Character customization as it stands in a microtransaction mess, and while I got like 34k RTC for being a founder or whatever the â¥â¥â¥â¥, what's available for purchase is rather lmitied and boring. Even though I like my cosmetic sidegrade to the powerfist, I still feel like I wasted my free RTC on something so â¥â¥â¥â¥ in game.  The melee system is entirely unbalanced, and while I've had a few good moments, it's very clear from the start what melee weapons stand as the best, and that is no way to balance your video game.  Hit detection is a mess, but if this game gets any updates, I'd hope that would be slowly fixed.  The balance of each race seems haphazard with no thought put into it, and nearly every round I played people would be talking about the balance of races and weapons, shockingly calm seeing as it was either calm discussion or orc fanboys screaming in all caps like they're in middle school.  Which brings me to my next point, the type of people who play this game, generally you get those who take the game way too seriously and scream in the chat like the orcs they are playing, or those who generally act like right â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ whenever someone critizes the eldar being fast tanks, it's cancerous, but so far it's not as cancerous as thought it would be which is good for now.   tl;dr I'm not sure if an attempt at making a good warhammer game was made, but it clearly has fallen flat.
13291	This game is a multiplayer battlefield-esque shooter, that in its current state is sadly unrecommendable. I enjoy the game, dont get me wrong, but mostly because i've hoped for a game like this in a 40k setting for a long time. I've had a lot of fun with it, and the community is clearly full of avid 40k fans, which is always a good thing in a game thats meant for a fandom. However, it is very obvious that the game was released way too early for its own good. The game is laggy as all hell, theres fps drops, freezes, and race balancing is still a thing to be hoped for. This is especially bad in fortress maps where the amount of players and effects makes the game unbearably laggy, and it becomes fairly impossible to shoot properly or accurately at anyone. At best, you point in their general direction and hope the screen stutter calms down for a moment so they dont just lag past your bullets. Of course, you could always play melee, in which the dominant tactic seems to be mashing the melee button as hard as humanely possible. If you encounter another melee user, it becomes a little more tactical, having to time parries and heavy attacks and such. But mostly it is pressing the melee button until the person you're aiming for dies. I can only wish for the devs to fix the problems that the game has eventually, and i hope that the balancing is looked upon. If they succeed in doing so, im willing to bet this game will become one of the most played games for me. But before they do so, its only worth 20e, 30e if you're a fan of the 40k franchise. I'd suggest waiting for at least a few months so they can sort out the major issues, and when they do, its definetely worth picking up.
13292	this game is going to blow. no more ppl are playign it , the class are unbalance and the lag cause the only match happenign is in america while you are in eurpoe even remove all the small fun that even was a in the game .  sorry but the game is going to die and soo n, teh delovpper took toolong to fix al teh issue an inbalance i the game. heck they even removed teh number of ppl playing it on steam caus e it show how few ther eare
13293	I love this game and it's devs. This game wasn't ready to be released.
13294	â¥â¥â¥â¥ poor shooter with a WH40k paint job. Devs promised the world and after years of watching the game being slowly stripped down to basically nothing - they can't even seem to get that tiny part that they actually finished right. Sins include:  No real tutorial - You can go to a starter area where you can interact with things to recieve game tips. There is no flow to this and its easy to miss tips  Menu - The Menu still has clickable options for functions that were either stripped or are currently not available in the game. But dont worry guys, the in game store works just fine  Ugly textures - They say the game has been in development for about 4 years but the character models look worse in every way that than 'Warhammer 40k: Space Marine' which was released before this game was even a twinkle in a developer's eye  Poor gameplay - Your characters have no weight which makes me feel more like Im playing Quake than a modern shooter. The cover and vault system is glitchy and inconsistent and the vehicle animations are broken for the most part. I noticed that several vehicles have wheels that dont even rotate when they drive. They just surf around. 50 bucks for a 'released' game where you haven't even finished the animations on one of the major parts of the game? Jesus  I could go on about how the videos and description of the game in the Steam store still reflect a game that was proposed years ago but have IN NO WAY REFLECT WITH THE CURRENT GAME. I could also talk about the horrible frame drops, server performance, inexcusably long queue times, and awful inventory management. .... but I think others have those pretty much covered as well.  I'm also a little annoyed that in thier release announcement they admitted that the game was flawed but still tried to encourage people to vote positively so they could get more sales. Seems to me that in order to get good reviews you need to actually deliver on at least some small part of your promises. Giving this game a positive review right now would be lieing - and baiting even a single other person into paying you for more promises to stack on top of your record of complete failure so far would be so karmicly wrong that I dont think they even have a word for it.   Pros include the Maps. They obviously worked hard at crafting the game world before they ran out of money, and the maps I played looked fantastic. That's pretty much it.  =============================  That being said I am keeping an eye on the game. I've watched it religeously and snapped up every bit of information I could over the last few years so at this point it's hardly an effort. If they can manage to actually make positive changes to this steaming pile of crap - maybe even deliver on some of the original dream I would love to apologize and change this review. I guess there is always hope.
13295	It pains me to say that this game is not what it could have been or what it was promised. I was one of the individuals that purchased the founding package and then some after reading about all the features this game has. Well flat out they lied and this game as i am currently writing the review for is a shadow of what they promised. So even if you are a fan of Warhammer dont waste your money. I know this gamer is getting tired of being lied too for his money.
13296	Im a direhard 40k fan, i have been for about 8-10 years, i used to live and breathe 40k, ive played most of the video games and most of them are pretty good, but this ... is god(emperor) bad, its not finished, not even close. I cannot believe the balls they have, releasing it at the stage it is at, i wish i couldnt relate it to warhammer and i certainly wish i could get my money back.  I played the alpha and beta alot, and believe me when i say , they have changed next to nothing. Do not waste your money on this garbage, save it for DoW3 , at least that has a chance of being decent.  How the holy hell did they take all the patter away from orks? ... thats an achievement, they made orks boring ... ffs
13297	False promises. Terrible execution. Barren playerbase.
13298	TL:DR:  An enjoyable third person multiplayer shooter with plenty of action and diversity for playstyles. A great game for 40k fans, but the game is clearly unfinished. Bugs, crashes and balance issues can get frustrating and the lack of different game modes might put off the more casual fan. If you aren't a die hard fan of 40k its probably best to steer clear until the game has been polished further.  LONG â¥â¥â¥ REVIEW:  If you're looking for an online, team based third person shooter/action game then you'll have one here, just not a very polished one. The game is by no means broken, but it is very unfinished. I have encountered plenty of bugs and major crashes, but if you are able to put up with them it is an incredibly fun game. The developers are also very enganged with their community and are constantly updating the game to provide balance and bug fixes.  The gameplay takes some getting used to as characters are a bit floaty when moving, but the shooting feels great, melee combat is visceral and personal and each faction feels very different (except Space Marines and Chaos Space Marines which I will get into in a bit). The game also has some pretty bad balance issues at the moment of writing. There are really only 3 game modes and about 5 maps. There is a 'large scale' 60-80 man mode (though ive never seen a match that big using matchmaking) a smaller 30-40 man mode that uses the same maps as the larger one, and a co-op 'PvE' mode where you go fight Tyranids in an abandoned complex. The multiplayer matches play out similar to the Battlefield games, with a series of objectives around the map that one team must attack and the other defend. Only certain classes can capture the objectives forcing players to work as a team. There are also transports that can be used as mobile spawn points and light tanks. These modes are enjoyable but the co-op can get repetitive and unkillable Tyranid Warriors make it a frustrating experience; especially considering how little reward you recieve for completing the incredibly difficult mission. It's still entertaining but like most of the game feels very unfinished and unpolished.  Eldar are fast, their weapons are accurate and deadly and although I'd love to say that they are squishy, they simply aren't. It makes for some frustration when you empty your autocannon or heavy bolter on a banshee and she runs straight at you and slices you chin to groin in one slice. Definitely needs some work in that respect as they are considered OP by everyone (just like in tabletop).  Orks feel like Orks; big, brutal, and tough doesnt even come close to describe them. It's a similar feeling conveyed from the novels or tabletop when the bigger, meaner orks simply dont go down without a LOT of damage being sunk into them. They are also absolute powerhouses in close combat, taking less damage from the front and being able to charge into the fray with reckless abandon.  Space Marines are pretty much the bog standard power armoured super soldier with ridiculous weapons and wargear. The stormshields that the ground assault class can take feel like they need a bit of re working as a marine with one of those and a powerfist is unfathomably difficult to kill. I don't have much to say about them since as a faction they are a jack of all trades and master of none and feel like the weakest of the 4 races at the moment.  Chaos is mechanically identical to their loyal counterparts, right down to their wargear options with very few exceptions. The big difference between the two Astartes factions is their choices for advancements and skills. Chaos can take any of 4 marks representing the Chaos Gods and each comes with its benefits and downfalls. They also gets a sorcerer class instead of the Apothecary the Space Marines get. These marks really alter the play style of your character even when chosing the same class. After the Eldar, Chaos is very flexible but takes some time to get the advancements for that flexibility.  By far the most enjoyable aspect of the game for me has been the Advancement system. This allows you to really fine tune your character and specialize in a specific class or weapon tree and you can get a lot of great passive bonuses to stats and wargear to beef up your character. Its a great feeling watching my little Ork slugga boy look more and more intimidating and become tougher and tougher. These advancements also can grant abilities to be used in combat (mostly for support roles) and wargear such as armour to add to your character. Every class also has an 'elite' version unlocked via advancements that grab whatever class you are and turn it into one of the hero units from tabletop. Wargear, armor and stats are upgraded and it is going to take you a while before you'll unlock one of these.   There is a small amount of character customization, but you will have to dish out real cash to get these cosmetic items, and frustratingly enough, some wargear will simply change the look of your armor completely (and you wont be able to see your Iron Warriors skull on your chest when you get warpforged armour, goddammit). However, this is completely optional and you can use in game currency to purchase loot boxes to receive extra wargear. These are completely random and use a tier system, but I have recieved plenty of requisition from matches and usually after 2-3 games I have enough to buy a few of the mid tier boxes.  All in all, I have really enjoyed Eternal Crusade. Although it's clearly unfinished, if you are a die hard fan of 40k like me you'll have a blast. If not, best steer clear while the bugs are ironed out and the game is finished. 
13299	I...really just honestly don't like it. Melee is broken. The game is full of bugs. Fired a Plasma Cannon and watched my shot just disappear into thin air.
13300	Yes I only have an hour of playtime. Why? Because it's not the game that was pitched to me when I paid for a founders pack so long ago. Is that my fault for believing the developers? Yes. Is that also the developers fault for delivering basically nothing that they promised. YES! Go play the 3rd person shooter Space Marine game, because it's better than this. This is a mediocre lobby shooter that was supposed to be an open world, massive battle, pvp/pve MMO. I wouldn't have written a review if they kept it in the alpha state that it is... but they want to release it to people. So fair warning, you are not getting anything more than an alpha level lobby shooter.
13301	Right ya grotz opun ya lug oles n lisen ta me. Dis 'ere game wat da ummies called finished an it aint. it bein like a grot wat got is 'ead in front of a spikey boys axe, F****ed  I wanna love dis game an give it a speshal place in me eart like but it sucks like one a dem pansy eldar beggin for is life while bein dangled upside down over da drops  sure da lights n beamy stuff looks pretti and da bolta make a ok sound but you aint 'it nuffin an ya used up a 'ole stack a bullits jus so's some git can kick ya teef in wen 'e gets up close like  bought da kaptains pack cos i see dat dis game 'ave worth, mighty worth but serisly i cant give it away to no one, reals like.

Many!!
13302	The game play is clunky, the graphics are something you would have seen about 15 years ago (even with everyting on Ultra), apparently there's a store, which makes no sense given the fact they are asking full price for the game.  Basically the game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ and the devs are con artists.  STAY AWAY! 
13303	Do not buy this game. If you are a die-hard Warhammer 40k fan, keep an eye on it, and  maybe  it might be worth buying someday. I would not hold out any real hope though.  There is enough information in other reviews about the state of the game and the actions of the developers but I figured I might as well add to the pile. Regardless of their shady actions the developers have not shown any indication that they can truly make this game good. Every (often delayed) patch brings nearly as many problems as fixes, and they have seemingly been outright ignoring glaring and easily fixed issues that have been around since alpha. It might get somewhat  better , but it will never get  great . Their idea of a 'MAJOR Content Update' basically boiled down to fixing (take the word 'fix' lightly) a few things that should have been fixed months ago, and giving the  Salt  Space Marines a weapon specifically designed to combat Eldar speed instead of actually fixing their netcode which would have solved the main problem (hit detection) itself. I do not honestly believe they have the skills (interest, perhaps?) to fix the issues that plague this game.  For what it is worth I have had fun with this game. However, it is the kind of fun you have to suffer for; you will spend more time fighting the clunky controls, mechanics, sticky scenery, and poorly thought-out map design than you will the enemy.  Assuming you get to fight at all, since the player population is so low and so skewed towards LSM that if you play any other faction you will only fight LSM 90% of the time, and most players on LSM seem happy enough to stay there and complain about long queues as they join up in 10+ player warparties to pubstomp other factions. Such is simply the state of playing the game as it is now.  I cannot recommend paying the price this game asks for (even at 50% off) in its current condition. Give it a year or 2 (assuming it survives) and if the Ruinous Powers smile upon you it might be FTP or actually worth spending something on.
13304	 Early Access Review
13305	 Early Access Review
13306	There is a simple reason why I can't recommend this game right now. It was not ready for launch.  During the early acces time, I nothiced a lot that the game needs more polishing and rebalancing, a lot of stuff they wanted to add isn't included. I can understand why the Devs released this game now, since it was years in developemeant and the date of release got pushed back so often,that I lost count.  The game has not only potential,but is also fun to play. It's kinda like a Battlefield in Warhammer 40k style, with different classes,squads and comm options. As bonus we have a rock paper scissor Meele combat system. Heavy&gt;Light&gt;Parry&gt;Heavy  However like I said above,the game isn't ready for release, I can understand the decision the devs made,but can't support it. The microtransaction button on the frontpage is also for cosmetics only. Stuff like different armor and golden weapons. Reskin DLC's are common now in basicly every game so I won't complain about that.  In short. The game has potential,the gameplay is easy and fun,but the game isn't ready for release just now.  If you're interested,wait some months and try it then out. If they keep working like in the EA phase,they will fix most problems during the next 2-3 months.
13307	I honestly can't recommend this game - it just isn't worth $50.   Functionally, it is a very clunky game. For example, the melee system has 3 different attacks (strong, fast, and parry) to form a rock, paper, scissors type of combat system. This is a neat idea, but the problem with it is when you find yourself in larger battles, a scenario which is ironically used by the devs as one of the major selling points of the game, the system is instead more of an 'oh dear, what the heck is happening' system.  Aesthetically, I don't really think the game shines that much either. Visual quality in most areas is subpar at best, with certain visual effects bleaching your screen with their blooms and glares. On top of all of this, in tandem with the aforementioned $50 price tag, all character customization (fancy armor looks and the sort) cost real money to purchase, something that I find completely rediculous (mind you, I'm not a business guy, so I'm sure there are business reasons for this that are beyond me).  Overall, I think the game could definitely eventually become something worth perhaps $30, but it's current state is so abysmal that I can say with certainty that, unless you absolutely love the 40k universe like me, you should steer clear of this title at the moment, and perhaps for good.
13308	Bought this game on a sale, warhammer fans beware. This games tries way to hard to be two different things(MMO and Shooter) and fails at both. Have the movement of an MMO with really bad shooting controls. So its just extremely clunky and frustrating. As well a lot of expensive micro transactions, Ex. left shoulder pad for one type of character is like 5.00 USD and its just a skull on the base shoulder pad. Apperances are extremely limited as well as they do not share across most classes, unless you're an ork.
13309	Terrible.  Just terrible, I've tried golden throne have I tried.  This games imbalance is out of this world, I used 30 bolt shells on a single ork. But he can one hit kill me? This game man, I want my refund so bad.  I'm sorry. I wanted Eternal Crusade, but I'd rather have Dark Millenium back.
13310	Do NOT buy this game in its current state. I am a diehard 40k fan and even that cannot save this game's abysmal performance. It is unbalanced, broken, the wait times for games are absurdly long, and the level of customization is pathetic.   I typically do not bother with reviews, but this deserves one.
13311	TL;DR: The game needed more development time and was launched too early. The missing features are coming in, but they're not going to be added in the immediate future, so itâs best to save your money 'till then. At this moment in time, itâs currently a mediocre lobby shooter with a 40k aesthetic.  I also bought the game when it came to Early Access for around 40 bucks.   ---------  I'm not going to delve into the entire history of the game, but there were a few issues with management, senior producers exchanged, the upcoming fancy sever tech (from a third party) never came to fruition, the game being rewritten from Unreal 3 to Unreal 4, etc.   A lot happened during development... a lot of money had been spent/misused. The team did what they could with the pieces they had and tried to make everything come together in the end. Unfortunately, not everything did come, and a lot of things were left off in the distance... hoping to make their way into the game in the future. The question is, how long the game will last âtill then?  Right at this moment in time, the game is a lobby shooter with persistent characters. Persistent in the terms that you gain xp, purchase advancements, buy boxes with in-game currency for gear/upgrades, and customize your character with paid cosmetics (in a $50 unfinished game btw).   Xp gained during matches is converted 1 to 1 to the in-game currency of Requisition. This right now is primarily used to buy Lockboxes, which in turn grants weapons, weapon skins &amp; upgrades. The problem I have with this is that unless youâre playing a faction/class that can easily get kills for xp, youâre going to end up progressing slowly. Also, instead of buying the equipment and upgrades outright, you have to hope you get lucky with a box and pray that you get something youâll actually find useful.   You CAN buy the base weapons, but they cost a significant amount of Requisition (upwards to 10k-15k). Also, letâs say a brand new player logs into the game and sees a lot of enemy tanks. Normally, they would use an anti-tank weapon to counter them (such as a lascannon or a melta gun). Unfortunately, these weps donât come baseline, so either they have to grind 10k-15k worth of requisition (or hope it drops from a box), or theyâll have nothing to combat the enemy tanks with. The best the player can do in this situation is to alert their team-mates and hope they can counter it for them (which at times, just doesnât happen).   Then, there are advancement points which are used to âadvanceâ your character. These are earned in-game (similar to requisition, but at a much smaller rate). Basically, you spend these advancement points within your advancement tree. Normally in other games, these might include stat passives, new abilities, etc. But in this game, itâs mainly just small stat trinkets (such as +4 health) that you have to go back and equip onto your character later (for a loadout cost), or you can get 100pt loadout cost discounts to certain weapons. As a player of Chaos, you can also purchase the different Chaos God marks (which will affect your stats in a thematic way), or chaos spells for your sorcerer to use.   On paper this sounds alright, but in practice is comes to be a very boring and linear progression system. Also, the ramp up of the point cost for advancements set in a higher rank becomes super expensive. At rank one you can gain an upgrade ranging between 4- 14pts, but down the line at rank 4, you can easily see many things priced around 60-80. Itâs not like these advancements are that much better in quality (most are just the same styled small stat gear upgrades and weapon discounts). You also donât gain advancement points any faster as you rank up either, so it just becomes a slow and tiresome grind.   As for Campaigns, they ARE coming in, but they aren't present at the moment. The world map isn't actually an overall map of the battles at all; it's just an infographic to determine how well the races are competing against each other.   Speaking of maps, it is my personal opinion that they are not well designed. There is a lot of wasted space, capture points are ALWAYS in small, crowded areas, thus making it an area difficult to play in if you're not inherently good or well equipped to engage in melee. There are times where Capture points under your control will allow you to spawn right within the area of capture (which means youâll usually spawn in a massive melee/plasma cannon death fest if the point is being rushed by the enemy).   Tanks are in the game, but they see seldom use. They can be very effective if properly fully manned, but more often than not theyâre driven by a single player without any means to coordinate with the group. Rhinos, and other transport vehicles, exist to travel teammates around the map, as well as to provide a mobile spawn point. Many are just used for the latter, as most of the times when I find a mobile rhino, it usually just has around 2-3 people inside. I find the majority of players will either run across the map, or wait to die and respawn somewhere else instead of hitching a ride inside a transport.   As for the shooting itself, itâs pretty generic. 40k lends itself to be a massive, glorified, battle-hardened world, so itâs pretty disappointing to see that a lot of the core combat mechanics arenât up to snuff.   Mostly youâll just find players either spamming attacks in melee or theyâll be using heavy, long range weapons sniping you at a far distance. Thereâs nothing inherently wrong with that, but there is a midrange tier thatâs not really being utilized. The maps donât lend themselves to a lot of mid-range combat, and apart from being able to cap points, playing the standard âtactical/traitorâ classes doesn't seem as fulfilling in combat (imo).   As for melee, itâs done with a total of 3 attacks by using a very hard-counter, rock-paper-scissors styled system. You have a light attack, heavy attack, and a defensive bash/stun. Thatâs it. No combo/linked attacks. No special moves. Most of the animations I find arenât timed correctly, and with added lag, the melee system isnât an enjoyable experience for me. Iâm not saying it canât be fun, but at the moment, I find it a bit dull to pick up and play.   There is a pve mode against ai tyranids, but I havenât played it. I know the goal is to progress through level sets with a 5 man team, but they cap your xp gains while in there, and it honestly looks very repetitive and non-engaging.   I could go on, but if youâve made it this far, I believe you might have an idea how I feel about the game. I like the concept, I like the loreâ¦ but the actual core mechanics just arenât there. I can't recommend it at its current state :/   
13312	This game is far from finished. The melee is extreamly clunky, the progression is slow, and the weapons and factions are extreamly unbalanced. If you are a fan of warhammer do not buy this game. It has been released as a full game but, it is not even close to being the game they sead it would be. They labled the game as an 'ever evolving game' but that is just a way to say they don't care that the game is unfinished they will just say it is finished.
13313	If you enter a timemachine and travel 4-5 years back in time, then the eternal crusade would have been an impressive MMO BETA stage shooter.    The environment is indestructible, the vehicles are pure silly to watch or drive, Melee combat is a mess, faction balance is off, few maps, long grinds, Lag!, and tons of bugs.  The really killer for the game: Microtransaction! You get a standard look and the only way to costumize it, is buy paying for rogue trader point.   Price tags: Cheap helmets, shoulders, torsos, legs : 5-10 euro Weapns and expensive armor parts will cost you 10 000 trade points and note that you can only buy 4000 or 9000 trade points , so in order buy a weapon or expensive armor part, you need to spend atleast 15 euro.   If you love Warhammer and don't care about paying for a half cooked, buggy game, then buy it, else spend your money on something else
13314	I bought this game as a founder excited by the idea that WH40K would meet planet side. I was excited that i could customize my character like in spacemarine and enjoy an action packed massive bttle game.  I played the alpha and felt the mechanics were good but not what was promised but the developer promised to improve it.   They didnt.... what was released is a terrible 3rd persons shooter that requires you to play a lot to unlock anything remotely customizable... which looks like crap at best.   To top it off. If you do buy custom items and equip them you lose grenades until you level up. In other words to invest sucks because you gain nothing at the start. ALSO you can even see whats coming until you level up because yeah that makes sense.   In Summary what was promised was not given at all. The game plays like crap. Its boring and you only battle 1 v 1 race instead of the massive battle promised. it does not feel like 40 k at all and honestly the developer should be ashamed to even call this a release as the alpha was more fun.

13316	  This is a very hard game to talk about an leave a NO as recommendation for. I have played a decent amount (for me) of this game and have had some genuinely enjoyable matches/moments. I'm thinking about joining a guild, I want to see this game grow, and have fun with the community. I believe the devs can keep working forward to fix this game.  That being said, the game is a mess, built on a lot of promises with very little to show. Now I can't get too mad at the Devs for going back on the initial promises since there was apparently a massive change in management and direct. However, I can be mad at them for not properly addressing this to the fanbase. I just new they didn't have Free-to-Play options and a lot of other things just weren't in the game. I really hate this pattern of games releasing way too early and slowly fixing themselves.  Also $40 USD is a bit high for what is currently in this game when there are dozens of Free alternatives, but I guess 40k is enough to keep a price tag. I do believe the sales price of around $20 USD is much more reasonable and I willingly bought the game for a friend to play with.   TL;DR: I think this game can be enjoyable and have hopes for the future, but currently it's just too big of a mess to really recommend.
13317	i could be long winded into why i do not recommend this game.. but i will say that most of my 2 hours i played where in queue looking for a game or in the training camp, and when i finally DID play a game you will simply get smashed in one hit anyway.  MAYBE purchase if on sale. MAYBE.   POSITIVE - i got a refund. shame i couldnt with no mans sky.
13318	The game is still in alpha, don't let them trick you thinking otherwise... Unoptimized mess that had ton of potential! At current state worth about 5â¬.
13319	For me this is the worst game ever. Balancing is â¥â¥â¥â¥. There aint no content (actually alot less than is THQ Space Marine) There aint no story There aint no gameflow There aint no World.  For a lobby shooter its much too expensive &amp; styleitems like a shoulder or a chest costs ~10â¬.  That EvE Guy should have stuck to eve, he aint competent leading an 3D-MMO-Studio at all... Nathan doesnt stand for QC at all, there aint no polish, there aint no NOTHING.  Nathan Richardsson = very low quality &amp; money ripping games.
13320	Good game to test the refund feature.
13321	If this were a beta maybe then the state of the game would be acceptable. Feels more like a late alpha. The game is barely optimized, and runs terribly. Bugs everywhere and terrible netcode. Balance is in the gutter and I spent most of my time in this game locked into a spawning animation as some guy beat me to death. The game couldn't even recognize what weapon killed me half the time or be bothered to play any animations for any of the laser based weapons.   I'm a warhammer fan boy with 15 full armies for the table top. I was excited to give this a shot. Instead I'm excited for my refund so I can buy more models for a real warhammer game. Games Workshop really needs to be more selective in handing out their IP. This developer needed more experince or support to make a more polished game.   I may try this game again in a few months after a price drop or some more polish is added. Far too soon for full launch and far to buggy for a $50 price tag.
13322	Unfinished, unpolished and sold at AAA price. In its current state, avoid like the plague.  Falsely advertised as an MMO while it's a lobby shooter (and not a very good one at that). Co-op is next to non-existent too. Doesn' really have a unique 40k vibe either, could just be a retextured generic shooter.  Absurldy overpriced cash shop too.
13323	Crap game still. Space Marine was better i'd suggest waiting till they pull thier collective heads out of thier collective rear ends before playing. Maybe the next patch. waiting 20 mins in spectator mode to respawn is booooring. The controls and mouse look is sluggish and sloppy. the graphics are a little low end for a Warhammer game as well.

13325	 Early Access Review
13326	Iam a huge Fan of the Warhammer 40k universe and the second i heard they wanted to make a 40k mmo, i just had to fund it. Because what they wanted to make this game sounded like a dream-come-true. So naturally, when the game got released for funders in an alpha state, i was ready to fight a in a universe in which there is only war.  the second i got onto a server i noticed, it is a worse version of Warhammer 40k: Space Marine or probably the worst version of it. so i deleted it instantly and wanted my money back, so i did that and got my 160â¬ back and forgot about that piece of crap.  today i gave it another try, maybe they made it to what it should have been. AAAANnnd NO... they did not. it does still feel like a disgrace to this universe, but GW is still handing out licenses to whoever wants one and it is weird that most android games with the 40k license are better than this...   And i honestly hate those who made it, what it is, because i had such high hopes and they got smashed by Behaviour Interactive just like GW is smashing the tabletop game into bits....  i sincerely hope that someday i wake up and there is a greater deamon of slaneesh standing before me, because i would know that this piece of garbage was just imagined torture by the deamon and did not actually happen.
13327	I'll be keeping this brief.  Basically, it's an arena shooter based in 40k with classes, four factions, and a lot of clunkiness. The game isn't perfect; there's lag, the odd bugs, the odd control issue, the occasional horrendous visual bug, and then audio error galore. It still looks alpha, still plays alpha, still is very alpha - and has microtransactions to boot (I'm still waiting on my 20k RTC, it's been a month for god's sake).  It's also fun, a bit nutty, and has plenty of plans ahead of it, given that the dedicated devs continue to support it. There's few games where I've been able to really get Orky with my teammates - and here, it's â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ priceless when you get rolling in a huge WAAAGH in chat, and somehow absolutely steamroll the enemy, balance issues be damned.  At this time, however, I cannot recommend this game for the $50 price point.  It's like a half-baked cake; unfinished, tasty, but only partially solid, and best enjoyed with friends. Given time, maybe that cake'll get finished, but for $50, it's a steep hike and you may be better off saving for now.  zog dis i'z gon' get stukk in wiff da bed
13328	Bought the captains pack the moment it was available and before there was any possibility to know what would come. They announced great things to be the core of the game and I was already quite sceptical from the beginning. But I thought: Okay, give them a chance to create a game that finally lives up to the great franchise and does not suck like many other WH40k games made before. During development they announced that more and more of the really nice features announced would not make it because of different reasons. I was disappointed but that was okay, because they explained why that was not possible. Early Access for founders came and I wanted to jump right in. Well, look at my playtime on record? Not even 3 hours. Why is that the case?  First of all: Performance. The performance during early access was already bad. Thats okay, it was early access. But even when I tried the game after release it was horrible - event though my PC is able to play all new top titles on high details and so on. Nonetheless: The performance is lacking and I am having great problems to play this game without regular frame drops, lags and so on.  Secondly: Controls and camera. The controls are sluggish and feel absolutely off during play. In addition the camera makes a lot even worse. You are fighting with controls and in addition the camera doesn't help at all. Keeping an overview of the battle around you seems to be nearly impossible. And even if you know what you want to do the controls don't want to let you do it. Best thing to do for me was to take a window facing an important doorway or the likes and camping there. Something a lot of people were doing.  Thirdly: Factions. Okay, Chaos and normal Space Marines being alike is a thing I was expection quite a bit. They have their differences but are still quite similar. But when fighting the eldar or orks the feeling was... the same. They have different models but fighting them feels very simmilar. Okay, Eldar seem to be faster but hey, might also be my imagination. When playing them myself I felt like playing just anothe Space Marine with Eldar Skin and different sounds...  Fourthly: Balance. In combination with the factions you might think this small eldar might just explode when hit by a bolter shell? Or that maybe a few bolter rounds should down a space marine? Nope. Ranged combat always was quite horrible because the weapon damage seems to be that low, that you have to shoot at an enemy with three to four allies to get him down before he reaches cover. Meele combat in comparison downs you that fast that there is nearly no possibility to react if someone comes into close proximity. In combination with the bad controlls the rock-paper-scissor component of meele combat feels like hell. But this system rarely is important because you are killed before you can react. Another thing was just an impression and I was not able to play enough to get a better look at it but things like chaos sourcerers just do funny things and seem to be quite overkill at the moment. But: I didn't play enough to see if it is a real problem. We could talk about vehicles but I really don't want to, because they are a pain in many ways...  Looking at the game at its current state and ignoring the fact, that there were much more features announced: Warhammer 40.000: Eternal Crusade is an below-average shooter with Warhammer 40k skins. The shooter part does not work very well because the controls, performance and balancing have a lot of problems. Warhammer 40k seems to be only there when you look at the name, models and the surroundings. I neither get the feeling of playing a Space Marine, an eldar or an ork when playing those factions. Even though the game Space Marine had its own flaws the feeling of being a Space Marine was much better there.  As already was said in many other reviews: They promised much and delivered a game that, even when you look at it in an 'arena-shooter' kind of way, is not a good game.
13329	I could barely put 3 hours into this rubbish. Controls are clunky and horrible. Engine is not optimized and performs horribly. The game was supposed to be like planetside2, but forget all that. It's the worst shooter I've ever played. Then the devs say this:    'Now you have a persistent world third-person shooter. It is a game. We love it a we have played it daily for almost 2 years now. '  and   'The largest MMOs in the world have less world persistence than we do.'  The audacity of these statements is on a level that you only see from EA. I don't expect to see this game survive or improve. The game also has micro transactions lol. Instead of buying this you should just send me $50 dollars and I'll play it for you, thus sparing you the misery.
13330	TL;DR  Wait to buy, game has imbalanced races, weapons are heavily imbalanced, premium currency is sketchy, new players are going to get â¥â¥â¥â¥ on, and servers are unreliable.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Alright so this game feels more like an alpha than a release. Unreliable servers, several disconnects, time outs, and freezing. The technical side is iffy as well, I have a decent rig and this game chugs a lot. No option to turn off screen shake either and it is so sevre it is akin to a seizure simulator.   Now I bought this for one reason. Orks. I was hoping for black templar but they aren't in the game. The orks are a mess. They have twenty additional health compared to the other races but less armor and toughness. Sounds good right? That is until you discover that all of your opponents weapons enough damage to the point where that extra health doesn't help you at all. Essenially they just overkill you slightly. The ork weapons are innaccurate and have bizzare draw bracks. Rocket launchers for the orcs have a charge up time... Mind you this isn't the reload, you have to charge up the rocket... There melee is also slower than the other races. No their melee system is a mess as well, there's a rock paper scissors mechanic for it but it only comes into play when you both hit at the same time. Essentially the only time an orc is on even footing is when they have the surprise on the enemy. There is essentially no point in playing orks unless you enjoy them like I do.   Next up is the Eldar. Aka, melee gods. Yes, that is correct, if your cringed then welcome to the club. Now we get to the weapon imbalances. Why are the Eldar melee gods? Well that is simply, they have the fastest melee attacks and very specialized melee classes. A striking scorpian who is invisible will most likely one hit you. A howling banshee will do ninja flips and smack you around. Now this may sound over powered (and it is to a degree) but their ranged weapons are terrible. Their fusion guns are essentially useless against troops and barely noteworthy against vehicles. Their heavy weapons and melee is their saving grace. The kicker is that they have a longer respawn time than the other races. Effectively making any enemy race they are against feel like a horde.   The two space marines I found no problems with aside from their melta weapons having the same issue with the eldar fusion gun. Even the multi-melta feels weak. Space marine players are also belligerent whiners. Whenever I played as a SM they none stopped whined about being two shot by heavy cannons or that they died from a clip and a half of ammo from an ork. (thats 90 rounds btw). The sad thing is that this is the group that the devs listen to.   Combine this with all the hacking, the unreliable servers, and incompetent devs. Hold off until they get their â¥â¥â¥â¥ together.   
13331	Sadly disappointed  The game crashes each time I leave a match. Other players skip about - the lag makes it impossible to aim The animations are awful - the chracter models look stretched and badly proportioned.  Frankly, this game looks 15 years old. I was hoping for a larger scale Space Marine game, but this is a massive step backwards.  Even at 60% discount, this is not a good deal.
13332	Cons:  - Terrible optimization - Horrible balancing with all factions, I play all of them and I have no favourites(However if you do decide to purchase this game I warn you, I do not advise playing Loyalist Space Marines unless you are in a Clan. Otherwise if you enjoy the tedius grind and constant losses, by all means have fun) - Community is becoming increasingly toxic (Both on the EC forums and in-game, I believe this is due to the above balancing) - Developers do not address the main issues raised by the fanbase on the EC forums - Rubberbanding and Lag(Server side issue) - Expensive for a game which is effectively still in 'Alpha' it also doesn't help that you have to pay REAL money to customise how your character looks, and this is not cheap either - Very little P.v.E  Pro's:  Warhammer 40'000 setting Unlimited potential  I want to like the game, I really do it has so much potential. But I have lost all faith in the developers and I cannot foresee that in the future it will ever get better. Oh they will add new content, no doubt. But the server and balance issues I feel will always be a problem. Call me pessimistic if you like, I have been here since day 1 with optimism but there is only so much disappointment I can stomach.  Note:  I will update this review if the developers do indeed fix the majority of what is wrong with the game in the future as I will continue to play until I feel I have got my moneys worth.  For now though I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to new players in it's current state.
13333	I am a huge 40k fan, if you are not a huge 40k fan, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  The only reason this game gets a positive review from ANYONE, is because they are a 40k fan.  This game on it's own is not finished in the slightest. It's not optimized, it's not even remotely balanced, it has more bugs than working parts because it's not even remotely finished, and there are a million sound/video/texture problems.  Eldar and Orcs were rushed, I've never seen models so bad with broken animations,  On top of all that the game is laggy as â¥â¥â¥â¥, which makes it 1000x more frustrating to play because you can't tell if it's laggy or buggy at times.  I bought this game in early access, I played the game in early access. The only people that play this game are people like me that love 40k and are desperate to play our 40k characters in a game. That's the playerbase and it's the only reason there is a playerbase or a single positive review for this game.  If this game was set in a different Universe every 40k player would â¥â¥â¥â¥ on how bad of an actual game this game is.  So, do not buy this game if you are not a devoted 40k fan. You won't play it for more than 2-3 hours.
13334	Quite easily the worst game I have ever played. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this game... It's not worth the headache.
13335	This is the first game I've ever permanently removed from my account.   Un-balanced, Un-finished, and Un-worthy.
13336	This game has potential to be great however that does not mean its great as of now.  The game in itself is buggy and unfinished and seems to have been rushed released before actually going through a proper beta. Also a lot of the promises that where made in regards to it being a MMORPG haven't really been kept (The PVE side is kind of pathetic).  Although this game has negatives I have to say its made fun by its friendly community, the warhammer community is always good and nice.  Ill still follow this game and play it and unless you are a warhammer 40k fan this game will feel like a waste of time.  Bugs for the bug god and low fps for the low fps throne (Like 2 fps atleast)
13337	Now I haven't put a whole lot of time into this game due to other games I play and usually because I'm busy, but from the time that I have played here's what I see:  Pros -Warhammer 40k -Battlefield/Planetside feel with a little PvE thrown in -You get to play SPESS MEHREENS/Chaos/Orks/Eldar  Cons -Not a lot of customization for races besides orks -In-game credit you must purchase if you want to get said customization -Frame rate sometimes drops -Camera way too close to character when you're weilding anything that isn't a pistol and melee weapon -Still feels like an alpha/beta  All I'm going to say is this doesn't feel like a complete game. Other reviews that you may read will tell that this isn't that great and to an extent they have a point. It feels like a lot is still missing from the game. As well from my experience from playing the game it always feels like que times for matches take way too long and when I do find a match they're either unbalanced, like the match I just played recently, or nobody is in there besides me.  On top of that, having a game you have to purchase but then are subjegated to buying in-game credit to buy customization or anything in the game is a huge no for me. A game that is free to play I feel has more of a right to do this since they have to make some way of making a profit so that way seems fit (to an extent). This, however, is something that you roughly paid a whole game worth for and you still need to give more money if you want to look stylish. For the most part most of the customization isn't that great looking to me.   In conclusion, I really don't want to say this is a bad game per say since it does feel like it has the potential of being really good, but in the current condition right now it still feels like it's in testing. Overall I'd say either wait for it to drop down in price one day, go purchase the Space Marine game and wait for this to get better content. It's a damn shame though. I was really looking foward to this being good at this point.
13338	Got it during prerelease, and was not impressed. There seemed to be nothing finished, though the characters and animation did seem like they had the weight of Space Marines behind them.  Tried to play it after release only to find that it is set up for wide screen monitors only and can not be changed, which puts quite of a bit of a drain on attempting to give it a try.  Would not suggest getting, even if discounted. Host company is often guilty of hitting you with micro transactions to make any of their properties any fun to enjoy. With such a huge problem right away, can't imagine how bad it could really get.
13339	Played beta seemed fun, Tried playing the game when released and man is it a let down. The game needs balancing badly. What happens when you rush games out. Hope it gets better so i can start playing again
13340	Regardless of what was promised in the past, as a finished game Eternal Crusade is bad. Janky animations and uninspired models run around gunning each other with weapons that are either too overpowered or blatantly otherwise, that is until they are struck by a butterknife and lose all capacity to fire a weapon. The maps are a mess of design and imbalance, prone to exploits, glitches and blatant undesired favoritism of either attackers or defenders by means of its structure. The game modes are essentially 'Capture the Victory Point' either in order, in a King of the Hill style match or racing against the tickets in defence of a fortress. To be fair, the last does lend itself well to the occasional dramatic defence or offensive, and it's a pity this doesn't readily pass over to the rest of the maps in this game.   There is an in-built shop for overpriced cosmetics, some of which don't even get a Quality check before being pushed out and are essentially a copy-paste recolor job of standard wargear. This is particularly egregious in the case of the Eldar, who took headgear from one class, recolored it without changing the insignia and sold it as cosmetic 'upgrades' for another class. Why they charge the prices they do for models as uninspired as they are, I've no idea, but I would conjecture either delusion or attempting to get as much money out of a dying product as they can.  The community has steadily devolved to cynicism, trolling and the acceptance that this game will never be as it was promised. Torn between new players with low skills and grizzled veterans coordinating with each other as a well-oiled warmachine, and adding to the lack of upgrades and critical key weapons, a new player will inevitably have a period of squeaking out victories against other new people intersperced with being destroyed by the veterans. Unless they are playing a character from a race which the developers had unintentionally (or otherwise) made overpowered by one of their many design oversights, in which they will win a series of one-sided games, then once the devs fix it they will begin to lose every match they're on and storm the forums with accusations of unfairness. Adding some manner of tier system would only work if there was a healthier playerbase, unfortunately it would only make the queue times longer.  Ultimately, there is not much to do in this game. There is a dreary lack of content of worth for a game in development as long as this one has. The PvE component is a dull slog against some of the worst models of aliens from outer space I've seen in recent memory, and the PvP is a slog from humping victory points in one uninspired map to the next. The claims that this game contains a 'persistent world' because it tracks victories and defeats in a simplistic campaign map is ludicrous, as are claims that 'inventory = persistent world'. Yes, there is persistence, but you can't call it a freaking 'world' can you? Why are these factions, split across 6 regions, duking it out in the same maps over and over? Why does this affect the campaign? The only faction capable of replenishing its losses at the rate of the typical match is the orkz, how are all the others not extinct by now?   Make no mistakes, this is merely a lobby TPS with a 40K flavor, and I can't in good spirit call it 'good for what it is' either.
13341	 Early Access Review
13342	This game is more dissapointment than the 12 years I spent waiting for Duke Nukem Forever.  F*ck you polite guidelines steam, the game is garbage, the engine it runs on is garbage, and most importantly, the DEVS are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ GARBAGE.  I don't often take very long to reach a verdict about a game. The most time I usually spend on one single game is around 200-300 hours. I spent a very long time experiencing this thing change very little since you were able to buy into its closed beta, and all how it is changed is its gotten â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ier, and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ier over time. Core issues with the gameplay such as clunky movement, poor optimization, terrible un-fun ranged combat and my favorite getting stuck on corpses. Soo in closing I can safely say that after having experienced things soo far this sh!t show dev team is never going to get their act together.  I rolled my eyes hearing about this idiot teams decision to push for an early deadline, knowing how crap EVERYTHING is ingame and how they've shown no motivation or interest in fixing it. Myself and MANY OTHERS have been yelling at the devs for A F*CKING YEAR NOW about every single thing that makes pretty much everyone including myself alt-f4 and uninstall this abomination.  Don't support this dissapointment, just check it off on the list of OTHER TRASH W40K TITLES.
13343	 Early Access Review
13344	As a big Warhammer 40k Fan i cannot side idile and watch this any longer  It is more then clear that the devs love ONE side from the others  The Chaos Marine have auto cannons, now i know what you're thinking 'but Draco, Autocannons are still managable' and you are correct, some times they are, unless they are all pointing down at a point or on a fortress, which then they make an impossible wall of defense, you might as well kiss that game goodbye and roll the 'you lost' screen, the rest i can understand with Chaos and accept it  The Lovely Orks got their Rokket luncher, now i understand it takes 2 seconds to lockdown, but the Aoe is just stupid, an Ork can shoot someone in point blank range, i repeat 'POINT BLANK' and it will kill the enemy and leave the Ork untouched and i don't know if it damages the armor but it doesn't matter, if you shoot a rocket at point blank range you should DIE, the Waaaaaargh is annoying, but completely understandable, since Orks always Swarm planets they attack  Last and least at the most OP thing in aaaaaaaaall of this game, the Eldars now lets compare something Loyal Space Marine: geneticly engineered and added with a lot of implants, starting HP? 200 Chaos Space Marine: also geneticly engineered and also flesh is touched by the Warp, starting HP? 200 Orks: a beat of a creature, with huge muscles and the fact as soon as they are born they fight and kill, starting HP? 200 Eldars: a regular eldar, a bit of army experience, nothing to make them special, starting HP? 200 WTF!? they are not strong enough to have same HP as Marines or Orks! to top that, they are also faster and far more agile, they dodge way better and are harder targets to hit, so have fun shooting something tiny but as tanky like you!  Oh, and how can i forget about their lovely lovely â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Hawks? every jetpack class in this game has a melee weapon and a pistol, but not eldars! they have a gun! and to top that, they can hover and more rapidly, so they are basiclly sentries that you put in weird location! on top of boulders that are hard to hit and they can easly just dodge you, the only times i managed to get a Hawk dead is when he was distracted or with a very poweful shot/hit  you get roughly around 5-6 Classes for each Faction, but not eldars! :D they get almost double (or double) THAT! they have so much classes that its just weird Did i also mention that their weapons have NO recoil? but yet they do as much damage as Heavy Bolters and Shoota, logic right?  Dear game Devs, i will contiune playing not only cause i am a big fan of Warhammer 40k, i also met awesome people at the game, we rage together about how little effort you put into something that could easily be an art work of a game I hope you will add stuff to each Faction like it SHOULD BE! (really? no Flamer or Warhammer for the LSM? its like A B C!) how about caring and showing the other factions love and making the best of this game? adding a new shop menu and world map overlay is nice, but we prefer gameplay updates thank you  Emperor protect us all
13345	Game is unbalanced garbage. Will die soon, once people realise it is just a horrible excuse for a shooter with the 40k name taped too it.
13346	DO NOT BUY IF YOU'RE FROM AUSTRALIA/NEW-ZEALAND, GAME IS UNPLAYABLE. No oceanic servers. regardless of your conditions (connection/pc) you will probably have a 3-5 second delay between what you're doing and what everyone else is doing. This makes it ridiculously hard to kill anyone/anything and ridiculously easy to be killed by anyone else, even allies.  I haven't seen any sign/interest in changing that situation either. I'll delete or retract this should the issue be resolved, but I'm not holding my breath. Can't believe I supported this game with stupid a founders pack.. What was I thinking.. Blinded by hope i guess. Update: They some how made the lag between pc and server even worse. But hey if you like playing a game where you need to counter your oppenents moves, at 300+ ping or higher. Good luck with that.
13347	Game is broke. Yet to get on a server that isnt lagging like all hell, are there even eu servers?
13348	Graphics very cluncky, other games out look so much better. VERY unblanced races and classes. Payed the $100.00 kick starter feel ripped off with this crap. would like a refund. Almost feels like typical GW product screw your customer . I quit 40k about 2 years ago after playing it from the late 1980's. Was hoping for a quility product and got â¥â¥â¥â¥ on. 
13349	This game still feels as if it is in early access. Throughout the entire development the developers seemed to ignore overwhelming player recommendations and continue down a track that arrives at what is a bland, messy game.  The weapons are horribly unbalanced and the combat system is unintuitive and convoluted. The UI feels cheap, the character animations are nothing short of terrible and the graphics, while nice in some parts of the environment, are otherwise 'meh' despite the game being incredibly taxing on hardware.   Not to mention the latency issue for anyone not in NA. If not for the 40k aesthetic, this game would have been a laughing stock.
13350	  Currently, i cannot in good conscience give this game a positive review. The fact that at the start of the games development it was intended to be an MMO akin to Planetside and was meant to have a free to play aspect with 'Free to Waaagh', the game has neither and is instead an arena shooter that in some circumstances is better than Space Marine's but in many others is worse. For one, atleast in my experience, the melee combat is utter â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t, there is no strategy, just spam right click and hope for the best, if you're not an assault class chances are you're going to get your â¥â¥â¥ handed to you. Playing as an effective apothecary is frustrating, as you and the person you are healing need to stay still in order for you to use the item on them, making it difficult to do when under pressure. On races, there isn't really much of a tangible difference between them besides looks and different loadout options, except for the fact that eldar are pretty OP in close combat with some classes taking you down in one or two strikes from full health.  The 'Lair' game mode is promising but the Tyranids don't really act like what they're supposed to be, they slowly move towards you, sometimes not even moving towards you and just staring at you if their pathing screws up. It doesn't really feel like they are swarming over your squad like Tyranids should. The warrior is an interesting enemy to face however a lot of the times I have faced against one they get stuck on geometry due to the sheer amount of firepower being directed at it.   I can say that the Art and Sound teams did an excellent job on everything, well, except for the Ork eyes, they look a little crazy to me. Although i am a little upset that basically all appearance options are behind a paywall and that there are limited appearance options anyway, lacking variations for arms, legs and backpacks, Where are my Bionic limbs?!  I will update this review as the game itself is updated more, but right now, in its current state as of the 11th of October 2016 i cannot recommend this game however much i want it to succeed.
13351	Barely works, animations are a joke, frequently crashes. You're better off waiting till it gets fixed in like a year or two
13352	The Codex Astartes does not support this game.  Downvotes from angry fanboys appreciated.
13353	 Early Access Review
13354	-microtransactions are not welcome  -super clunky combat and movement  -non-fluid map design  -poorly optimized  -very buggy sound and combat  -unclear progression  +nice graphics and sound  +pretty maps    Why didn't they just take what they learned from Space Marine? Combat was good, game was balanced. But they didn't, threw it all out and this is what we got.
13355	Rushed out, laggy, missing alot of features. Eternal crusade is inferior in every way to wh40k: spacemarine...period  I wouldnt recommend this 3rd person shooter mmo in its current state, they need a year or so of futher development. Since its out now that wont happen.  
13356	This was initially promised as a Warhammer 40K MMO. For that I was really excited. Upon buying it on early access, what I got was easiest described as Battlefield 40K in third person.   Once you've played a round or two, there's really no variation. There's no greater context, no narrative to move forward, nothing. With an IP as rich as this, I can only imagine funding and development cost was a barrier. I found this game to be a disappointment. The models are great, the animations are good. The building blocks are there, but ... I guess this is as far as they got.   As it stands now, I'm sorry I bought it.
13357	one of the worst games i have ever played, and thats sad considering how much i like 40k. i bought it at 50% off and feel like they owe me 100% back for wasting my time. terrible controls/optimization, lousy (or non existent in some cases) customization, very few weapons, guns feel useless...on and on, too much to put. I would be at it all day.
13358	Wow, I really really weanted to like this game, finally a proper chance to battle in the WH40K universe. But sadly this isn't it. This is a game from 10 years ago, at best. The graphics are okish, but very uneven, some things are very detailed and looks good, while most look like badly sculpted filler.   The game interface is far from intuitive, and the 'tutorial' is not a tutorial, but more of a here you are on a map, do what you want, and in places we tell you which key to press, no cohesion, no real explanations, just push this and something happens.  There is not that I can see any sort of matchmaking either, players of legend are matched with complete rookies, so expect to get completely stomped for a while.  Now the gameplay itself could have been ok, if not for the horrendus unbalance. The marine with the biggest sword wins, I say marine since the other races don't have jump-packs in the same way. Once in a while you'll encounter a marine that isn't a jumper with a sword, and then you can actually have a decent fight with them, but usially another one jumps in and kills you. Now as I recall the assault marines, are fast, can jump and are in the grand scheme of things not remarkably sturdy. Here they hold up just fine from being hit with a missile-launcher that would have no problems penetrating a tank however.  So no I cannot in good concience recommend this game in it's current state. It would require a serious revamp to be worth it, maybe not even then, since the pricing is just ridiculus.
13359	Background story: I played warhammer 40k online a lot. And was so excited about his game so i bought the founderspack for around 60$ back in 2013 i think it was.  Short summary: It is sad the game turned out like this. And even sader that i payed for it.  Pros: - You get to be a space marine, eldar, orc anf chaos spacemarine in a 3rd person fire fight. - It was an exciting trip waiting for this game.  Cons: - It does not uphold lore. Like; Bright lance on a falcon does 2-3% damage on a rhino. Bright lance was made to cut through armor.... - Only game mode against AI is a replica of space hulk. Good? no. The Tyraniids are bulky and pure wierd. IT should be scary, and you should feel like you are getting overrun. - The loadout system is not nearly completed. You can make your own loadout, BUT most of the gear is not available for you at all. So the pre-made loadouts are the best to use, since then you get grenades and other stuff that i have no idea what do. - The level up system is ok at best. You can use some points to advance the classes, wich you build loadouts on. But it is weak. For example: This upgrade gives you 20 armor. They don`t feel like progress. - You have to buy skins for your units. Like cooler helmets, symbols and so on. And i mean for real money. There are few skins on most of the races and classes. - The vehicles are stupid weak and bulky. - I might just be a noob. But the melee is as far as i know the least inovative melee i have seen in the 20th century. There are specialized melee classes. And all you can do is spam right mouse button. If you hit at the same time, you parry. And you might be lucky and stun.  -You can execute people who are 'downed'. The animations are bad, and for all i have seen, it dos`nt achieve anything. It is just a cooler way to say: 'Yeah, i killed you'.  Concluison: This game will die out. Really soon. Do not spend money on it. The creators â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up. Sorry. It is fun for like one or 2 matches. Then you understand, this is alpha stage. Not a full release worthy game.  Of course i could keep raging on this game. But i think you get the point.  
13360	I mostly sit quiet and dont write anything about games, but I just cant in this case. I pre ordered this game and I have been playing it since the Steam Early Access. It was a buggy mess then, it was a buggy mess on the day of its release, but I was passionate about it and kept telling myself 'It will be better in time'. Well... it isnt... I want to love this game and I want to reccomend it to others, but I just cant. Sure, with every patch come some graphical changes, lag fixes and uptades to the shop, but the balace... oh the balance... if it even exists it is â¥â¥â¥â¥. I have rank 3 and almost rank 4 characters in every faction in the game... and clerly some are just better than the others. Everytime I let myself rest from this game and return after a new patch I see that it gets even worse. Dont get me wrong, I do have some fond memories of playing this game, but they are outweight by 'WTF!' moments. In its current state the game just isnt worth its price. I will keep playing it to see how it changes, cause I am still telling myself that 'Next time it will be better', but I am just a sucker for Wh40k universe.
13361	This game is not what we were promised. Behaviour joined with Namco-Bandai early in the year, and it went downhill from there. The game in its current form is broken, laggy, and horrifically unbalanced. It is not a full release game - it is a beta test, and it's disgusting that Behaviour continues to act like nothing's wrong and that people aren't very upset with them.  I shelled out for this game back before it was released on Steam. I'm a 'Founder', and honestly, at the moment, it's not worth the amount of money I put into it. I understand that purchasing a pre-release game is my decision, but honestly, it's not even worth the $49.99 they're asking at the moment. It's HORRIFICALLY overpriced for what you get.
13362	Such a shame, as buggy as Space Hulk Deathwing is, it's the better game; I was hoping for the enjoyment I had playing Space Marine on the 360 back in the day, since they basically used all the development from that game which was brilliant to play but something has been lost in translation, controls are slouchy like a R2 unit with a bad motivator...Robot Chicken style, and in Pvp the Eldar pretty much take out a permenant marker pen, write 'I own your emperor loving â¥â¥â¥â¥' just before they put a few rounds in you, cause they felt like it, the fun just wasn't there. Like I said a shame.
13363	I mostly sit quiet and dont write anything about games, but I just cant in this case. I pre ordered this game and I have been playing it since the Steam Early Access.

13364	 Early Access Review
13365	Simply unfinished. I don't think it ever will be, it's a damn shame. Save you moneys for deathwing
13366	The game is not ready for launch and is missing basic assets like weapon information in the post death kill screen. Weapons in the game are horrible imbalanced and dont have an option to view what mods come with your weapon. All weapons look like they come with 0 available mods to a new player because you only get mods from loot boxes, which is completely random. You can only buy base weapons straight from the in game progression, not mods. The game is just not complete, many features that were initially promised in the games early days are long forgotten and no longer part of the plan. There is no open world to fight over, no conquest of territories. The game is an arena shooter and its as much of an MMO as a Battlefield game. Basic things available for purchase during founder access arent in the game yet and they are not coming fora while. Things people paid money for are not even created yet but were available for purchase.  Overall the game is still not worth the buy even if you are a 40k fan, the game just isnt complete and the things that are not done yet really hurt the player experience. Furthermore the game sports a cash shop for visual customization in a game that is already buy to play. 2/10 revisit it when the game has actually been completed.
13367	If there were a neutral recommendation I would use it to rate this game, but unfortunately there isn't. There is only war in the Warhammer 40k universe, factions that have no trust in one another constantly locked in battle. The Imperium's Space Marines, the Traitor legions of Chaos, the Craftworlds of the Eldar, and the Savage Ork clans are at war with eachother to gain control of the galaxy. When the game is launched you come to the faction selection page where you may choose the faction/character to serve. Once you choose you are given the option to train in the garrison and train, but it can do little to actually master your ability to play. When you leave you are at the faction main screen where you can jump into battle quickly, go to the war page and see where your faction stands against the others and select the which game mode to play, change loadouts, join clans, and advance your character with advancement points. Starting off, the loadouts offer each factin with a unique class each with different weapons (for the most part) and abilties to utilize during combat. The Space Marine Tactical Marine can capture points and use normal bolters, while an Eldar Howling Banshee is a melee class that can scream supressing the targets around them and dealing high melee damage. The weapons can be purchased with renown earned through playing the game, but there are options to pay for guns/appearance items. The advancement offers many paths that can better you in combat with trinkets that boost armor and damage, but it feels barebones at the moment. While finally playing a match, the set controls felt awkward, but after playing around or changing them to my liking it felt a little similar to Space Marine's combat. Although melee is fun, the game's constant lag spikes propose an unstability problem where you often teleport around the room and find yourself dead. The executions look great when they are not bugged out and you are not firing at a corpse who has no animation. You can use vehicles and turrets, hopefully farther in they may bring in some tank matches into the game. Some of the factions feel like they are more powerful than the other which feels underwhelming when you are playing on that faction. Overall the game has work and produces much negativity to the public, but with some work hopefully the game will shine. For now, wait until these bugs are smashed, balance is implemented, and the servers are stable.
13368	If you like playing as Eldar or Orks and winning. This is not the game for you.  The basis of the game is being farmed by either the all mighty Space Marines, or the terribly powerful Chaos Marines and to fulfill their space marine fantasies at your own expense.  Eldar and Orks, if ever given an advantage are swiftly nerfed without much word from the devs.   At this time I do not recommend this game, and most likely never will as its only a scam to take advantage of the 40k playerbase.
13369	I love Warhammer 40k and I was hoping for anything along the lines of a spiritual successor to Space Marine. Space Marine was a well made game, if a little light on multiplayer depth. I was hoping for Eternal Crusade to expand on that depth and have a deeper take on combat and more varied maps. Unfortunatlely, Eternal Crusade is nowhere near complete for many reasons. The levels are large but simple. The combat is plagued with inconsistant hitboxes and difficulty reading the difference between friend and foe in close quarters. Combat ends up being a swirling melee of luck.  The worst thing is that the original goals stated for the game were completely changed and we now have a full retail price game with microtransactions.  EDIT: I now have returned to the game after watching videos from the staff. This game was just released too early. They sound like they understand the gripes and they are improving. I still dont reccommend this game overall but I only do that because it is incomplete.
13370	If you are a warhammer 40,000 fan, you will want to love this game. You will see the gorgeous maps littered with detail from the 40K universe and think, yes I can feel the lore. You will recognise the iconic weapons and races from the 40k universe and say yes, this is what these races are meant to look like. You will hear the sounds and see the sights and think , this game is for me, this is the one I was waiting for.  Then, like most illusions, it will quickly be shattered as you will suddenly think - how was this game released in such a broken state? Almost as soon as you hit the ground in your first game, the glaring issues and gaps will present themselves. You will understand that ranged weapons are mostly irrelevant and are classed into either ineffective short range weapons or long range killing machines.   Combat here favors melee, aided by the strange design decision to have an auto-lock on button for melee, where your opponent can roll and sidestep as much as he pleases, you will automatically track him as long as you keep clicking, eventually cleaving him to the floor. Advancement is slow and feels grindy, especially if you pick a tactical or ranged class - the game pushes melee, even if it wasn't designed for this. When you do end up in melee, it feels clunky and awkward, mostly devolving into button mashing in a crude rock/paper/scissors scenario.  Balance issues abound at every turn, where you will watch Eldar warlocks zig-zag at almost blinding speeds (so much so they don't even render properly) and cut down an entire group of space marines before cartwheeling away unhurt. Examples like this crop-up everywhere. You will experience unexplained deaths all the time, and endure fast brutal one-shot deaths everywhere else. Unload an entire bolter or plasma magazine into an ork, and he will eventually fall (however contrived that death may feel), and then watch him one-shot you with a crude knife. Wind-up your power-axe and hack a howling banshee from behind, only to have her spin around and casually cut you to the ground in the blink of an eye.  Vehicles also suffer this fate, and are mostly utilitarian, being cast into purely transport roles as the disconnect from the 40k lore becomes apparent here. A predator main battle cannon will take 4 hits to down an ork and most other races/classes, while infantry can melt said predator or rhino in about 3 seconds with a meltagun while dancing around it in a circle. Grav tanks have evolved from this utilitarian role to become 'death taxis', and can effectively be used to just mow infantry over at great speeds - again, another baffling design decision that survived an alpha, a beta and made it into live release - more proof that this game just wasn't ready for release.  Friendly fire is on, but again irrelevant, since punishments are lax, and after understanding the penalties, killing teammates becomes something that just happens and can be safely ignored.  Advancement points and using your currency after the battle can occasionally perk you up, but only after acquiring several accessories and weapons (and a desperately needed inventory system) will you start to make sense of it all.  There is limited PvE in the form of co-op based crawl through a Tyrannid Lair, and can be enjoyable for a time, but the AI and mechanics combine to provide a feeling of exhaustion, rather than satisfaction, if you do end up making it to the end of one of these lairs.  Somewhere, somehow, someone with the power to do so decided this game was ready for release, and made a fateful decision to let it go ahead in this state. Under these circumstances, as having the status of a fully released game, I cannot recommend it.   If the game is still around in 6 months (player numbers are already dwindling below 1000 a month after release, a troubling omen), then it should have the required polish to be worthy of an enjoyable open world warhammer 40,000 game - the marketing thrust which it originally opened with.   Sadly, it is an unbalanced, frustrating unfinished mess, needing some desperate polish before it fades away into another doomed 40k almost-ran that started with potential and great expectations but finished unloved and unplayed.
13371	Developer LIES to us about what the game will be. Acts as though what they have produced is almosts as good as said LIES IE lieing to themselfs that they aren't STEALING money from thier community. Then they pair that with backing off on preorder rewards and adding RNG chests for more money. Glad that they say they will support this turd they produced (Should have just remade space marines and called it a day), but it will never be the open world 4-way battle they promised and they will have to live with the shame of being yet another garbage company that choses not to deliver on thier promises. 100 dollers plus in for lies. gg thanks for being the last game I will support before I see the end product.
13372	The Emperor's divine brilliance isn't with this game Brothers
13373	TLDR version : Decent game lots of potential cannot recommend, in game premium currency currently sketch , major balancing needs to happen, still needs polish for a release. Get it on sale  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I like this game it is a decent game that being said I cannot recommend until certain key issues are fixed .   1. huge issue right now is that steam purchases for premium currency aren't translating correctly and support cannot seem to fix it. Players have also been told. 'We have credited everyone's accounts with 10,000 RTC as an apology for the wait.' This to has not happened. So until either the currency is translated or money is refunded well you can see how this is an issue &gt;_&lt;.   2. Balancing issues it seems as if most races were made but then certain classes / racial traits were just left half hazard as the game still has more content to be put out . the game is in release with out balancing for example all of the eldar ... just eldar . the other races are decenty ballanced with only certain weapons needing a lil tweaking ( not even a big issue really ) , but as many have said Eldar didn't have enough participation so they got the flavor of the month buff stick , but one of the devs just kept beating it.   3 players may expierence some derp. its a release game that is still being worked on give it a some time for some hard updates to come out .   For these reasons as of now I like this game, I enjoy supporting the release ... if it was supportable, and I will continue playing it because i have hope but i just cannot tell any one else to buy it at this time due to the bugs for full price. If you can get it on sale heavy discount rock it out.
13374	In its state I would not recommend this game, and even if they can eventually make it worth half its asking price the game will likely only have a hundred players left. Do not buy a multiplayer only game where there likely won't even be enough people to fill a single match in the near future.
13375	I have never reviewed anything on Steam but I feel compelled to do so and hopefully save folks some money. I wonât go into the litany of issues and bugs that plague this game as there are already numerous reviews that state them. I just want add another voice that urges caution to those expecting to purchase a polished, realise worthy product.  I have followed this game from the beginning and it has over promised and under delivered in every department. It is not a finished product and if it were not attached to the 40K licence then I'm confident very few people would give it the time of day. Despite all its 40K bells and whistles, it is fundamentally a fairly dull and generic Battlefield style clone. It brings nothing new to the genre and feels like I am revisiting any Battlefield game from the last 10 years.  As a 40K fan I have tried to like this game, 85 hours of game play will testify to this.   Even at 60% off in the Winter sale, I would advise waiting to see if this game can be redeemed with patches, but I am sadly not hopeful.  Clearly a lot of work has gone into making this game and I honestly do wish it well. As it stands however it's just too far off the mark to recommend, even to the most ardent 40k fan.
13376	In my opinion, I cannot recommend this game in its current state, nor will I ever recommend this game to anyone.  EVER   Why do you say that?   First off, let me just point out that I played during the early alpha access and am a founder (probably like most of you are) Now on to the actual reasons of why I would not recommend this game nor ever will at this time (if ever).      This game fails to live up to the game plans and designs.  The game is suppose to have incorporated mmorpg aspects into the game and be more than just your typical lobby shooter. While yes, it does feature  EXTREMELEY  limited mmorpg features, you have an advancement tree and you have to grind levels on your character to rank up, it's just essentially your typica lobby shooter with with little to no real mmorpg elements . The games so called 'mmorpg' features is ridiculous, and I mean RIDICULOUS and ABSURD amounts of grinding to get anywhere. Of course there are more things then just promises of mmorpg features, but that's one of the main, planned, game designs which the devs/game advertised and promised.       The developers of this game are one of the worst developers ever in history.   Why is that?  As Valnak's review of this game as already pointed out, the developers honestly couldn't care about the state of the game. They've already pointed that they don't have the 'current technology' to create an mmorpg. Yes you heard that correctly! Even though Planetside 2 already incorporates this so called 'don't have the current technology' despite what Eternal Crusades game design and plans boosted about.    In addition to this, the developers lack COMMUNICATION, the one vital thing to both the players, community and the games longevity, is the key thing called communication. These developers rarely communicate to the playerbase, dodging question and giving responses such as 'stop being entitled' that the community has asked numerous times, such as the advertised game designs and promises that they initially promised as well as    TREATING CUSTOMERS( Paid nonetheless) with absoluting no respect. e.g, ' LEAD/SENIOR DEVELOPER telling customers to BURN IN HELL'  https://i.imgur.com/ImngIyG.png         This game fails to live up to promises of being FREE TO PLAY upon release/Free to Play Factions  The games was supposed to be free to play upon leaving it's early access state/Free to Play Orks, which the game has not done thus far, If ever. In addition to this, upon leaving early access state,   THIS GAME IS PRICED EVEN HIGHER  than it was in it's alpha/founder state, as well as addding in  MICROTRANSACTIONS  as one of the games first priorities, which did not exist in its founder/alpha state.      This game lacks proper balancing and Optimisation despite the patches  The optimisation in this game is quite lacking, despite numerous patches being released that boost game performance, there is still a lot of lag in this game as well as unbalanced weapons and factions. e.g. Eldar.    The recently released newsletter, Content Update 1, boosts about how the game will dedicate itself in building trust among the community. It doesn't actually state how it will build trust among the community besides the general patches and bug fixes that they should already be actively doing, and not just for 'trust' purposes. I find this quite ironic as they have already proven themselves at being poor at communicating with its playerbase as well as being disrespectful to its customers as seen above.   In addition to this, I'd like to point out that this game was delayed for a LONG TIME, early alpha access was promised numerous times, however this was delayed constantly for 2 years before actually releasing the early closed alpha. Delays are to be expected, but for 2 years, and failing to live up to dates they estimated/provided as well as lack of content for those delayed 2 years of the alpha release (yes, I understand it's alpha but seriously, for 2 years what we got was disappointing).  Lastly, I'd just like to point out all these recent positive reviews saying that the developers are delievering promised content is a plain lie. Everybody blaming BANDAI NAMCO for the games current state, please wake up. It's not BANDAI's fault, it's the developers. Everybody these days always likes to blame BANDAI for every badly rushed game, however, please do be perceptive of other reasons why the game is in its current state, maybe a factor of this is because the developers of this game are based in Canada, and the government provides funding and schemes for small business, etc.  If these points above are not enough to convince you from purchasing this game, then I obviously can't help that. It's your money that's on the line and your choice, however I write this review to help potential people debating on the sidelines whether or not they should purchase this game, reasons why they should not and what to expect if they do decide to go through with their purchases.
13377	Well I would have liked to wirte something postive about this but even I can come up with vary little. The game is not a lets set down drink a beer and play a game. If your hoping for a battle field 2 or other type then this not for you the maps a tiny bit bigger then call of duty so no grand strategy game play.   races in game are space marines, Chaos marines, Orks, Eldar and its vary clear that the Dev do not play test the game nor care to hear about from players that bought the game any ideals or sugestions why is the case I have no ideal nor im even willing to bother even try communicating after reading what these dev said and the warped ideals in there patchs for the game. becouse any one that has played the game can tell you things like hay why when I have full health full armor Im one hit melee killed by chaos marine playing as eldar.   Granted I understood that starting off that could do vary little in killing other player when started due to having only the starter clasess to work with. I was fine with that I have always excelled in finding ways to kill something in these type of games or made my self usefull with healing or flag capping. Not this game melee weapons are top of the food chain. There is nothing else needed but if you don't think that would mater then let me point out one ways to kill armor {tanks and APC} in this game is use melee weapons lol.even I can not fathom how misslie luncher does nothing but guy with plasm sword can hit drain all power and still deal ton of damge. If your willing to look past all of this and try it out then let me make the recommendation pick the choas or space marines as the most love is there and you can easy see it in there awsome skill trees orks and eldar skill trees look as if they gave off to one kids of dev to make for you to work with. I was shocked when I saw the choas skill tree after playing with eldar and orks.
13378	well i thought to write this review after i bought a decent pc who could actually run it and at the end i'm really disappointed. servers are bad ad hell, pay to win everywhere, some calsses or races are op (chaos marine, havoc) and these are the same problems that i had one year ago when i bought this game before the release as a founder... the eldar race is literally the worst animated 'thing' i've ever seen in a game that was released... to bad... it had potential and i really hoped that it would be a nice game since i love the 40k universe... if i'd could give my vote 1/10 (oh wait i can i i already did)
13379	Nothing more than a beta sold as a game. Thousand bugs. Few player. No optimizations. Unbalanced. And...a little boring. OK I believed in it... I was wrong. Better another game, trust me.
13380	This game is BS
13381	Ok, first 40K tabletop or THQ space marine fans, avoid at all costs!  Early backer since the pre alpha here, had great hope for the game. It was supposed to be a Planetside 2 like open world, mmotps, with a mmo style progression, when basically subscribers would be playing spaces marines against hordes of orks, played by F2P players. Progress, looked good at the beginning but first they dropped the idea of open world, then they started adding some really unfun mechanics, stuns, rock paper scisors Close combat mechanic, huge COF on every weapon. They gave up the idea of the elite factions beeing vastly outnumbered so they made everyone more or less the same. and they made everything move to quickly.  so what we got is a small maps lobby based rushed and really poorly designed , .....eldars hovers tanks really don't hover....the lore is basically ignored just because it was easier to do it this way.  Well basically the games was still in alpha a few month ago....don't full yourselves, it's still is.
13382	- game not finished and never will be - original content cut out - unbalanced and the developers are not doing anything - developers live in their worlds where this game is perfect and everyone is happy - bugs that crash the game - waiting for a match to start for over 20min - inbalance is pushing the players away from this game - dead game don't buy it if your a fan of warhammer 40k
13383	I am not angry about the current state, but I can say it is a disaster of a game. There are too many posts detailing out false promises, horrible bugs and unbalanced gameplay which I have also experienced. The response from the devs and especially the community manager may have just put the nail in the eventual coffin. Check the stats for yourself, however. Look at how many copies were sold, and then what average player base is. My personal recommendation is to STAY AWAY FROM this game.
13384	TL;DR: Do not spend money on this pile of crap.  I backed this game in good faith about two or three years ago for ~25â¬. I played it throughout the alpha and now after release. And this game is still a huge clusterf*ck and definitely not worth 50â¬.  - the performance of the game ist still very bad, considering the low graphical fidelity of the game - melee combat outperforms any other type of combat, simply due to its lackluster design - faction balance is still miles away from an acceptable state - the character customization is a greedy cash grab - there is literally nothing to do in this game, except bashing each others head in  - the game is not faithful to the source material. I do understand that SM/CSM cannot be demigods killing Eldar and Orks with ease. But it is laughable when you (a frigging 2.50 m, 1000 kg Space Marine) can get easily killed by a flimsy Eldar with a knife. - vehicles can only drive in like 15-20% of each map. They are quite useless as troop support, except for beeing mobile spawn points.  May the God-Emperor have mercy with the poor souls that bought this game.
13385	In its current state the game is broken, it really does not matter if your a 40k fan or not a broken game is a broken game.   Avoid this until the devs can get their act together, brought it on sale and still feel cheated.   Plasma spam is not fun especially when you die before there is any sound or animation from enemy weapons.   This game is a nice idea and nothing more. BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK!?!?!?!
13386	This game is too raw, yet i hope. Lags, factional disbalance, bad hit detection, bad performance optimisation. It doesnt deserve its cost.
13387	This game is inferior to Warhammer Space marines, and that game was budget title. This launched with most of the features missing.
13388	a released game looking and feeling like a beta test is unacceptable, Why warhammer seems to be cursed to mostly bad video games is a mystery to me, but this game feels like they gave up near the finish line. Plays like garry's mod with some very nice warhammer sweps.
13389	Unfortunately this game did not live up to a dream.  PlanetSide 2 is still better.
13390	Four hours was honestly all I needed. Should you buy this game now? No. Absolutely not. Should you buy this game in a year? Maybe. It might actually be a finished game then.  There's not a lot that I could add in a review that hasn't already been said. The game was released unfinished, with not even a third of the content that was promised, there was a severe lack of communication from devs on changes being made to said content, there are SPECTACULAR connectivity issues (I kid you not, I once got stuck loading into a map for half of a match, and by the time I finally loaded in, the game kicked me for inactivity. My internet's not THAT bad.)  But the one thing I really want to add is this: Even if you are a massive 40k fan, please, skip this one. Don't put your money towards a game that's fun for all of ten minutes just because it has a shiny coat of 40k paint on it (it's not even a good paint, either, it's hard to tell what's going on on the map half the time). Maybe if we stop buying games like this, Games Workshop will finally consider giving a license to devs with a slightly higher pedigree than 'they made Naughty Bear.'
13391	Soo many thngs wrong with this game, dont get me wrong, I play it a lot due to the fact that I am a big Warhammer fan... but as soon as BF1 comes out, I'll swollow the crap pill that is EA and live with it.  Don't spend your money here just yet, wait a year or so.
13392	this game is straight up garbage but im a huge 40k lover....so truth be told you take away the warhammer 40k from this game and you have some straight dog â¥â¥â¥â¥.  pros  -easy to install  -easy to uninstall  -the fights can get pretty intense and fun i cant lie  - nothing like shooting an assault troop/swooping hawk out of the air with a plasma ball 14 times in a row and have them cry hax at the end game(prob COD players)   cons -netcode is terrible  -takes 20 bolt gun rounds to kill a space marine  -the tanks feel like that browser game from 2001(you know the one i mean)  - big fights of melee look like a little ceasars flipbook they handed out when you ordered 2 large pizzas in the 90's(im fat as hell trust me this was real) due to all the stutter and trash  - dog â¥â¥â¥â¥  - forced to release way too early rip
13393	I'm a founder and expected much more. The game is only half baked. Check back in a few months, if somebody is still playing.
13394	Massive 40k fan. Have held out a long time before posting my review, really wanted the game to evolve and be at least playable. I dont care about all the failed promises and even that this is just a poor lobby shooter. What really grinds my gears is how poorly it runs and how bad the server connections are for EU players. My system runs new AAA games maxed but this game runs 30-40 fps and the lag is gamebreaking. It is not fun, it is tedious and a shocking waste of precious gaming time. Simply put it is probably the worst gaming experience i have ever had. Tried the PVE element? i thought it was 1995, it is that bad! Will happily amend review if anything improves but lets be honest, that will not happen.  One more thing, the price is shockingly out of touch for what you get in return. This would be a poor Free-to-play, but Â£39.99!!!! Are you drunk!!? Course you are, thats why you also put in expensive cosmetics that can only be bought with yet more cash. No thanks  PS, interestingly, certain devs have taken to insulting people on forums when asking where the content updates are. Uninstall.
13395	Unfinished product, still charge for full price. Too many potential promises and yet none is delivered.  Bought this game because I'm a fan of War 40k but don't waste your money.
13396	This game is trash. It is just a buggy arena brawl. Not worth $50 and I highly doubt it ever will. I have been following it for quite a while now and I really didn't have too high hopes for it. Here we are now. The game is still trash.
13397	I wanted this game to be good, love warhammer, suffered through the years of crappy warhammer licenses because I love the lore. But its horrible in too many ways. I put in for a refund but cancelled it an hour later because I want the game to be good. I should have stuck with the refund.   The short version: Can't recommend, THIS IS A BETA! Way too many MAJOR bugs with the basic functionality: joining games, playing with friends, horrible networking, audio bugs. And then horrible controls, bad aiming, bad melee design. The HUD looks like 50 smashed lego kits, its very confusing and disorienting to know whats going on even after hours of play.  I hope it somehow gets fixed, but for now it will take a year for my rage to subside.  The long version:   First the bugs. Laggy as hell, horrible networking, friends always time out every other battle when making a warband and joining a game, then have to take 5 minutes to spawn in, quit out and remake the warband because the game disbands it on its own. Then roll the dice and see if it happens again. Massive audio problems where there are too many sounds playinig so they cancel each other out and you hear just the ambient map sound (WWISE FAULT.) More but enough for now.   Then the design. The controls are horrible and clunky, its like driving a delivery truck with a flat tire and busted steering. Horrible horrible aiming, half the time you cant tell if there is geometry in the way of your shot because of the awful player camera. None of the guns feel very good or satifying and its hard to tell where your shots are goind with most weapons, its just visual noise. There is IMO a horrible 'clang' system to melee which just slows everything down. Its like they jammed a turn based game into an 3rd person shooter and ended up with the worst of both. I assume they wanted to be on console so they went 3rd person controls instead of FPS which would probably have been way better, although its nice to see your cool character.  Pros? Its Warhammer. Great lore, cool characters although very hard to tell Chaos Marines from Space Marines so prepare to kill lot of teamates at first if you like Chaos. Its always cool seeing warhammer come to life, its just that too many things sour the experience.
13398	 Early Access Review
13399	Attempts to be Battlefront but wallows in small development. Ambitious, but unrealistic.  Garrison/tutorial is beyond stupid.  Progression is trash, a slog of ground war in mismatched odds.  Caters only to 40K fans and we're not even that many.  This will lose out to others. Does not even warrant an official FULL release.
13400	Biggest thing: the game launched even if it was NOT finished.  A lot of false promises from the devs and many proofs they don't know what they are doing (game design wise, mostly), not to mention the arrival of the (not) almighty Nathan with his 'I made EVE Online so I know what I'm doing'.   The result is just a huge deception and the feel of having given my money for nothing before beta to support this 'game'.  Just wait for it to become F2P, you shouldn't waste your money on this, especially if you're a W40K fan and if you had a crush on 'Warhammer 40k : Space Marine'.
13401	Fun in it's own way but the weaponry is â¥â¥â¥â¥. There are plasma spammers that one shot with that weapon and basically bolter is weak as â¥â¥â¥â¥ and melee spammers stun everyone letting them get a free kill when they engage in melee. The game is good but needs fast updates and repairs. And just witnessed that chaos space marines, eldar, orks abuse the melee like hell! You can't do â¥â¥â¥â¥ and they keep abusing it! The melee range is so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing big an you can't do nothing. Free kills â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hell! Armor bonuses don't do â¥â¥â¥â¥ compare to the LP it takes. Srsly get the melee spammers and autocannon spammers aswell off. Too â¥â¥â¥â¥ing overpowered and bolters seem to be weak as â¥â¥â¥â¥ and that needs to be buffed and the recoil while moving is way too much and even heavy bolters and autocannons have better aim than a bolter wich is so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. Updates on the match come so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing slow wich makes it even more frustating that they don't focus on balancing the game issues on the matches.
13402	I want to love this game, I got a founders pack for this game. The company constantly makes cuts to the project though and in its current state, you are paying 50 dollars for a 'released game' that is actually in late alpha at best. If you buy in now, just know you are buying a work in progress that might never see the goal line.
13403	First review ever and Im sad it has to be for this game i had high hopes for it. This makes me sad Warhammer is tied to it in any way its so off course. I feel cheated out of my money and hope all you devs feel ashamed for what you have done here Also first and only pre order ill ever do seeing as how you pretty much took everyones money and then said we've accomplished a small percentage of what we wanted to do but were releasing the game anyway and cant even get the basic feel of the game right ....just man so dissapointed  JUST TAKE THIS GAME DOWN AND STOP PRETENDING ITS ANYWHERE NEAR COMPLETE  its Insulting
13404	I want to love it... Though getting disconnected every second game makes it nearly impossible to. And ontop of that the game is in a poor state of polish for a finished title. With a difficult tutorial about in depth gameplay systems, poor race balancing, audio problems, and server issues. Might be something to look at down the road, or if it is greatly discounted. It's a good concept, just poorly executed.
13405	I am someone who has never played the Warhammer RTS's, but I love the Warhammer universe, and I always pick up the action games that come out; like Vermintide and Space Marine. I saw this game and knew I had to give it a try despite the pretty much overwhelming negative reviews after it had left Early Access, because it looked awesome and fun. I did not play the EA, so the claims the devs didn't follow through with doesn't bother me that much, the concept of a Warhammer online shooter is reason enough for me to be interested.  Take my advice, do not purchase this game. At least, not until they are able to fix some of the awful performance, balance, and optimization issues that currently plauge this game. What is essentially a Warhammer 40k Battlefield, with knock-off Gears of War gameplay starts out overwhelming and fun (Battles have like 60 players on a huge map) with a weak tutorial that explains nothing actually important begins to become a chore to play.  When a match hits it's midway point, you will most likely start the experience huge lag spikes and overall decreased performance. I asked the other players in chat about this and they all were accustomed to it, as if it was acceptable for a 60$ game. WTF devs? I'm running an i5 6500 and a GTX 1070 and ran at ultra until the issues started. Once the issues start, theres no fixing it. I put the settings to low and still had 30 -40 fps and immense lag.   The game is pretty when it works, which is rarely, you WILL experience performance issues, and it can be fun for sure. The combat is wonky as hell, the hit detection is not great and overall laggy, so you wind up with a awkward 3rd person very similar to Gears of War, yet all it succeeds in doing is making you wish you were playing Gears of War instead. Melee combat is clearly surperior, yet again the hit detection and lag make it unpleasant in addition to the janky counter system that is never explained to you. The factions are interesting but unbalanced as hell. The Eldar are overpowered as all hell.  TLDR: A no good, half baked Gears of War/battlefield imitation with a pretty coat of Warhammer paint slapped upon it which has potentional but is not a good shape right now, dont spend 60 bucks on it trust me.
13406	This game need more content, much more. This is ordinary shooter, not MMORPG. Dislike, for now. Pathes and content, we are waiting for you !!!
13407	A pre-alpha build of a game that will never be made being cashed in on at full price hinting this game will be abandonned or buried under 40,000 negative reviews because they decided to launch a skeleton of an idea of a game overnight, presumably because they ran out of money. Such a shame.. I have been jumping in and out of this game since it was available on steam and it has been terribly buggy and boring through and through. I knew what I had paid for though, an alpha, so I kept looking at the new aditions and improvements waiting for when the game would get good. It never did. I threw my money long ago knowing this may fail and I guess my hopes were once again too high. This mess was the state of the game up until launch.... Hell I'm pretty sure we still had placeholders in the game up until the launch date. Such a bloody shame.... It's times like this that I just bow my head and weep for the state of the games industry. Here's hopeing DoW3 is good so I can finally play a good 40k game again. It's been too damn long.
13408	An unfortunate, rushed launch. A shame because the game had the potential to be fun (I stuck with it this long) but it's been followed up repeatedly by poor decisions from the dev team with each succesive patch which have improved things technically but thrown any pretence at balance out of the window. I'd check it out 12 months from now (if it survives) in the hope that they finally got their priorities right and sorted out the faction balance.
13409	Glorified clone of 'Battlefield' set in 40K, but some how doesnt manage to copy many of the good bits !   So I despair. At the moment too clunky to enjoy, and would it kill them to include first person view, as 'aiming' is something that really doesnt happen in 3rd person view.  Queue times are atrocious!   I would fix this by allowing Mis matched teams, But the teams with the fewer players get Armour buffs to even things out.  Or at least Add BOTS , because no one plays this game for fun anymore, just to see if theyve fixed things.  Bah SPACE MARINE had a multiplayer better than this, player base lasted longer!!
13410	I continue to enjoy this game and have a lot of fun, but its not for the faint hearted.   The mellee system has all manner of unseen timers for iframes and evades and it takes 100+ hours before you can consistently use/abuse them. When you do 'Learn to play' it can be a lot of fun, though population is dwindling every week.   They rushed launch, wait untill the console release for the real 1.0 patch.   A 60% discount some 8 weeks after 'launch'? Well, I think this sums up just how much faith the publisher and developers have in this product.   That goal of 10 years of active development? I would not count on it, not even at the current turtle-like pace.   I do still play a lot, but as a new player I would stay well away from this one.
13411	I want to love it... Though getting disconnected every second game makes it nearly impossible to. And ontop of that the game is in a poor state of polish for a finished title. With a difficult tutorial about in depth gameplay systems, poor race balancing, audio problems, and server issues. Might be something to look at down the road, or if it is greatly discounted. It's a good concept, just poorly executed.
13412	I am someone who has never played the Warhammer RTS's, but I love the Warhammer universe, and I always pick up the action games that come out; like Vermintide and Space Marine.

13413	I love Warhammer, I love Space Marines.  But unfortunatley this title isn't ready for prime time.  It runs poorly, terrible player lag and graphical issues too. Melee combat is unplayable due to the forementioned issues.  In time this could be fantastic but in it's current state it's not playable, stay away until someone reviews a patch showing it running properly.  I got refunded, try your 2 hours before the lock out, but I really can't recommend it at the moment.
13414	As a founder I've been with this game pretty much from the beginning. I finally saw potential for a good 40k game. I defended it, saying it was still alpha, so we couldn't expect it to be perfect yet. And now it's suddenly released. this is Beta stage at best, and the biggest waste of money that I remember committing to any project.  It's buggy, imbalanced and incomplete, even for a run of the mill arena shooter it's pretty lousy, if you were hoping for a good WH40k game, I recommend you move aliong and wait for Deathwing, hope for the best...  Pro: - Visual style is pretty grimdark, as it should be but still needs alot of work - There is potential for this to become a great game, but it's merely the foundation  Con: - Buggy - Imbalanced - Incomplete - Little variety - PVE is pretty much redundant at the moment
13415	What was promised and what we got was so depressingly bad, that I played one PVE mode match and uninstalled. The hype and marketing put into this game got even me looking forward to this 'awesome' game. What we got in return is a crappy, half â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, bad indie developer game that they should be ashamed of... Wish I could get my money back from my founder's pack -_-  P.S. also the fact that they have forum mods who beg for likes so people keep buying this junk and telling those who say no, the game sucks, I wont lie; to f&amp;^% off and started insulting everyone. Just shows what is in store for us with this game. 
13416	I really want to love this game... but I can't and that sucks as I am a 20+ year vet of the tabletop games and Warhammer 40k has been a huge part of my life. On paper this game designs itself but it's been executed so badly that honestly it shocks me that it was allowed to be shipped as it is. As others have said it is not the game we were promised and is missing a lot of features that were used as selling points for the game. What we were promised included it being an MMO, a huge persistent world, balanced gameplay and much much more. What we ended up with is a by the numbers arena shooter with rough clunky controls, Unbalanced gameplay, average visuals with terrible animations, character models that barely resemble the units they are meant to represent, a terrible client, loading times that mean I can go and make a cup of tea whilst waiting for a match to start, microtransactions everywhere and a generally unenjoyable mess.  Honestly this reminds me of a badly made f2p arena shooter and for me is the biggest gaming disappointment of the year. I find it hard to even bring myself to play any more and it seems that i'm not the only one that feels this way. Avoid at all costs!
13417	If you play Eldar don't buy this game. The Devs are dead set on ingoring them. I have watched the devs ignor a sea of eldar complaints and questions to find the one LSM or CSM question. They didnt even deliver half of what they said they would and dispite a large group of people not being an LSM player they seem to focus on them and only them. They wont even take the time to make a single Eldar customization. The devs insult and threaten their fans who try to speak their mind in anway that displeases them. Do yourself a favor buy a different game.
13418	Scope of the game has been greatly reduced in comparison to the features planned/advertised. Said features were still on this page up until the day of launch. This company has proven unable to gauge their own ability to make the game and appear to have been overly reliant on it being an early access success with no 'plan b.'
13419	500hrs played.  my advice is dont play 1 if you do dont spend more that 9.99 for this wreck of a game. the promises most were hanging in there for (myself included) will never be realized.  broken mechanics, broken grouping system (worst i have ever seen ever) toxic community and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ devs. ppl blame hasbro for forcing the release but in reality the core issue is with BEhaviour as this game was in development for 3 years and was still a amatuer title at best.
13420	 Early Access Review
13421	-Poor optimization -Laggy -EXTREMELY unbalanced -Buggy -Boring game modes -Pay to win  -Overpriced -Many features that were Promised not added  Just get WH 40k Space marine
13422	### Executive summary statement: The trailers are misleading and in some cases blatantly lie. If you are looking for a casual lobby shooter themed in the 40k universe and you play without expectations, this may just be the game for you. Who knows, by the time they release on console it might even play like a finished game. Alternatively, just wait until Spacehulk:Deathwing comes out in November to get your 40k fix or for your massive multiplayer shooter needs, BattleField One launches later this month (Oct. 21st?).    ### Executive highlights: - Not an MMO! (trailer lies) this is a traditional 'lobby shooter' with unimplemented strategic map that doesn't do anything. Currently, there are less than a dozen maps in rotation. - Typical character/weapon grind with power curve that will leave new players at strong disadvantage. - Pretty graphics and sounds, except when they glitch. - Suboptimal weapon/faction balancing (broken in some cases, but with intent to be patched).    ### How long have I been playing? Backed this game almost from the beginning; Captain's package cost me about $120 back in the day? I was willing to spend this money on the 'hope' that this game would deliver on half of what it was setting out to accomplish, but in the end, I can't say with confidence that they've made it even close to that far.    ### Marketing deceptions, buyer beware: As it stands, the state of the game right now is not living up to its marketing or trailers: There is no persistent world or even a dynamic world map to be affected by your battles... these are false claims. This is not an MMO by any stretch of sanity.    ### Game modes currently available: There are less than a dozen arenas where four [poorly balanced] factions compete in a 'skirmish battle' (traditional capture point style conflict) or 'grand battle' (sequential capture point style conflict with an extra siege vehicle type and limited lives for the defenders). There is also a PvE game type where a squad of friends can clear an installation of AI controlled tyranid, but in my experiences playing it, the animations were a little buggy and the enemies showed a severe lack in variety or intelligence, which just made the game mode boring at best and downright frustrating if you had any expectations for it to begin with. There is also a garrison mode, which is really just a small lobby to try out weapons against static targets and not a real game mode at all IMO.   ### Balancing issues: There are countless posts on the Eternal Crusade forums bemoaning and highlighting the balance issues present between the four playable factions, but underneath all of this the real demon is the way the game implements mixed melee/ranged combat. The melee system itself is a nice try at a rock/paper/scissors type combat, but with buggy netcode or server latency being combined with poor balance decisions in animation/movement speed differences between factions, this results in some unusual and even abusable game experiences.    ### Character grind and power curve: Starting out, new players will have a completely different level of challenge and handicap depending on the faction they choose. Some factions get a wider range of options for starting loadout, such as an anti-vehicle kit, whereas other factions will not have this same option for a new player. You must spend time in game to gain achievement points (this number is based on such factors as your kills and objectives) to unlock certain weapon types and perks as well as requisition points, which are used to purchase basic variants of these new weapon kits or random loot boxes, which may include better weapons or even just visually different weapons with the same stats. One limitation with the current unlock system is that it's character specific... if you make a Space Wolves character, for example, their unlocks will not carry over to a Blood Angels character even though they are the same faction... your initial character creation will lock you in visually to whichever chapter or subfaction you started with. Also worth noting, while there are plans to allow for payment to increase the number of character slots you have, currently there are four character slots to match the four playable factions, so choose carefully what you do with these slots.    ### User interface oversights: While the user interface is themed well and visually appealing, it is not very intuitive in places and really makes grouping up with your friends to play a match quite a bear. For example, once you manage to get your invites out to form a 'war party' with your friends, if at any point your party backs out of a queue the whole party is disbanded and you must re-invite all over again. It's also not clear at times where you need to go to perform certain actions. For example, every character has a limited 'inventory' for the gear they unlock and acquire (most of which, you will find is redundant or unuseful to you), but there is no single place you can go to manage this inventory and 'relinquish' these unhelpful items you've acquired... instead, you must build out a loadout that can equip that item, then open up the weapon (which you must purchase) for the item in question before being able to select it and relinquish it for more inventory space.    ### Immersion and visual effects: Right now, the best immersion is to be had with the 'grand battle' game mode, where you can be a part of a 60-player match fighting to defend or assault one of several fortress maps. The sound effects are awesome, except for the moments when they glitch... and the visual effects for the maps, character models, and weapons are beautiful. You will believe you are in the 40k universe right up until the moment you can't drive a vehicle through some invisible barrier that was implemented for game balance or the time you try to shoot across the map with a long range weapon only to find there's some invisible wall preventing you from hitting your target.
13423	This full release is worst than the early access version.
13424	I became a Founder in July of 2014. What a mistake. The game is made up of broken races, broken weapons and broken game mechanics. I will not go into what those things are as there are more than enough reviews explaining them , in detail. The developers of this game have shown their complete disconnect, not only from their own game, but also from this genre of game time and again. I wish I had bought this game on Steam because I would now be getting a refund.
13425	  As you can see i have put alot of time into this game thriving through my 40k fanboy self thinking and believing in it until today. I hoped and prayed as much as the odds were stacked against it. But alast its over, horrible devs, horrible community, horrible gameplay dont waste the time. Buy a couple 40k books instead and save the money.
13426	Game runs like â¥â¥â¥â¥, unbalanced, is not an mmo AND HAS NO SERVERS IN EUROPE.  â¥â¥â¥â¥ING DISGRACE/10
13427	Ok for the 25 dollars sale this game seems pretty worth but for the normal 50 $ HELL NO! Great Fun but with like 3 map and an in game cash shop not worth the full 50. The devs say there will be more content but who knows ?? If you wish to support this game go for it ! OTHER WISE WAIT FOR THE SALE!!!
13428	Promised it all on the hype train and delivered nothing. But enough about President Trump, this game is awful.
13429	Game needs a ton of work. At the moment, it's nearly unplayable.
13430	Game description is full of inaccurate information and straight out falsehoods.   Gameplay: Clunky and hindered by performance issues. Terrible control scheme just makes it worse.  Graphics: Unfinished and generic, below avarage. (Space Marine from years back has same level but better performance)  Performance: Even on much better rigs then mine it still remains sub par. On mine the melee combat is impossible due to lag and low fps issues.  Value: I would value it 5-10â¬ and that comes with a requirement of a top notch PC to smooth out the crippling performance issues and fondness towards the WH40k universe to ease with the overall unfinished and clunky feel.  Overall: Do not buy. Not worth the price and even has really heavy 'micro' transactions for cosmetic items and new weapons.  
13431	This game is horribly unpolished, I've really tried to like it, really I did, but that doesn't stop the fact that this game, and its devs are absolutely â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. They may say theyre working on it, but at most theyre making it prettier without any kind of optimization for the lower rigs. My computer isn't the best but it can definitely handle games far prettier than this no problem. Don't buy it, at least not until they actually finish it.
13432	In this condition its a pure insult to WH40k!
13433	I have 100+ hours in this game and all I can say is  Pros: - It has a 40k theme  Cons: - Game is very poorly optimized despite having 'performance fixes' in nearly every patch - Even when the game reaches its peak player count, expect to be waiting around 5-10 minutes to be placed in a match  - Devs justify all their bad design choices by saying GW approved of them - Devs get really b*tchy about critisism, especially when they're confronted about missed deadlines and broken promises - I had bought my founders package years ago and I'm still waiting on many of the promised features that were supposed to come with it.  I could name many others but those are just a few. tl:dr Don't buy it

13437	DO NOT BUY !!!!  First of all this game is not a MMO as advertised, it's a 60 (max) players TPS. The 1000's weapons and equipment is also a lie.  It has some performance issues, when many players at are the same place and perhaps even memory leaks, the more you play. Terrible server, or at list for EU players, where ping is those game is the most crucial factor. Very bad textures (low details), tanks are the worst of it, never saw a so ugly and disproportionate tank in war 40k. Sounds are glichty like hell, more the players they are, you'll want to mute or put your headset off. Factions balance is clearly off. There is auto-aim in this game, this will make you want to puke. You can also buy weapons with real money, also you cannot customise your character without RTC (real money), when the game already cost 50euros and is not a MMO. Also devs are deleting all critics on Steam forums ! And the list goes on.
13438	Gameplay went to â¥â¥â¥â¥ as soon as they brought in the customizable armor. I gave them a chance once they brought in the 2 new races but since then it has only thinned the playerbase. After playing extensively the game just gets worse gameplay wise to the point where some people literally only have to hit 1 button to play which quite honestly, bores the crap out of me. Some races are just better at everything and every 6 patches is when you actually witness changes ( the other 5 is them stalling or them saying they 'optimized' the game, you'll hear that word alot from them). I really hope they go out of business because these people are wasting they're time on a game that just dissapoints left and right.Btw for the 8 months I've been messing around with this game they still do not have something as simple as map selection. If you do get this game play as the Eldar, those are the devs favorites atm.
13439	It doesn't really matter what I say. People wont like this review regardless. They will down vote it because they disagree with it. Maybe they like the game? Maybe not... Maybe the review was too long, or too short. Maybe it didn't have something in it that you thought should of been. Maybe it doesn't have enough... there is no winning.  I really want this game to be good. I have been attempting to write a positive review, but there is few positives. I bought the game when it was 'Released'. I did not partake in the Alpha because I did not want to be apart of the ALPHA. Unfortunately the game wasn't ready when it was released, and there is not much good about it.   The game is extremely unballanced towards certain weapons, while others are near useless. The LAG is unbarrable. A typical game is running towards the enemy and then suddenly dying. No shots shown, no gunfire or anything. Its clearly lag. I will get BSOD or other crashes frequently. The bugs are non-stop. The Tanks are near useless. Its really sad :(  The GOOD news is that the game is beign worked on with Weekly/Bi-Weekly patches, Terminators coming REAL soon, and more weapons in the next weeks. They continue to polish and make it better, so this review could change to a possitive recommendation in the future.
13440	This game is a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ now.  Avoid it till it goes f2p
13441	For the love of the Emperor... Is it so hard to implement a squad-style limitation to loadouts? This â¥â¥â¥â¥ becomes SO not fun when EVERYBODY goes melee, or theres the ONE WAY TO KILL EVERYONE SO EASILY and too many people exploit it... Among other balancing issues. Like, EVERYTIME GW comes out with some 40k game it always falls short (minus DOW/SP Story). I love 40k, and I've always wanted a GOOD game. I'll never dog them for trying, but â¥â¥â¥â¥, PUT MORE EFFORT OUT THERE
13442	Massive dissapointment. Fun to play but plauged with bugs and cumbersome controls.
13443	The queue times are terrible. The Lair game seems kinda pointless. It's clearly not the MMO they set out to build when they initially asked for backers to support development.   All things considered, it's a fun game if you LOVE &lt;underlined and bold faced with hearts and unicorns dancing around it&gt; Warhammer 40k, but there are better shooter games out there for less $$ and fewer bugs than this game.   So disappointed in this game. It had so much potential.
13444	i played this for 50 minutes before uninstalling and refunding. it's like they took the space marine multiplayer but made it way worse.
13445	I bought the game at full price (60 euros !) during the release week, it was incomplete and looking like an alpha and was denied a refund after multiple requests. Now the game is on 50% sale after a month, I feel completely cheated. Don't buy it, this company has 0 respect for their clients.
13446	I bought into this crap 2 years ago and it's hardly changed since
13447	Looks promising, if it were finished.  As it stands, as of the latest patch, play anything but loyalist marines.  If playing as chaos, spam ground assault: you can cap, and as defensive bash still doesnt stun you, you can kill literally anything in melee with ease.  If playing eldar: Have fun, youre essentially untouchable.  If playing orks: You have the most damage mitigation, and the highest damage basic weapons in the game bar none. If your hitbox were as small as the eldar you might hold top spot, but you start with no AV, and they do, so sorry, theyll just run you down en masse with transports.  Most effective played with friends where teamwork can make up for the balance issues, playing alone in pug queue can be simulated by giving yourself a concussion.
13448	I wanted this game to soar. Unfortunately it crashed on take-off. I have been a WH40K fan for 30 of my 40 years on this earth and after the MMO was cancelled I seen WH40KEC come out as a project and knew I needed to back it ASAP. I did just that and became a founder, even got into one of the earliest Alphas when the models barely had color! Fast forward a few years, and what has been released really should still be Alpha or a closed Beta. The game mechanics are very clunky. Some good, some down right debilitating. Not much optimization has occured to the point of running smooth (I have a high end, self build gaming rig, been doing this some time now), I understand getting thousands of systems to run smoothly is a task given all the equipment variables, but this is just very rubber bandish and often at the wrong time. Next up the 'balance' is very much like Heroes and Generals, very faction specific, which causes the same issues as in H&amp;G. My biggest gripe is that as a founder, items I purchased in a pre-order has been either removed forever and never coming into the game, or not implimented at all. An issue that MANY others have already pointed out. Its just bad business. Seems like a bait and switch honestly. I will continue to play only because its WH40k, probably not much longer, but they will not get another dime from me. VERY repetative, nothing to really work towards, no 40K lore, So many mechanics are missing, Its like playing a COD Modded shooter, heck they even removed the 'bait' pic of the game details the day it was released....I had a ton of I hopes, but it fells like I just got mugged.
13449	I am really dissapoint.
13450	Sadly, it doesn't even meet the experience of Space Marine. A huge letdown for 40k fans everywhere.
13451	  Initially its fun but the game doesnt deliver anything beyond the basic combat. Weapons and wargear is unbalanced and there still are alot of bugs that ruin your enjoyment of the game. If this game survives a year from now It might be a really great game but for now its frustrating to play.  If you do play this game play it with a group of friends or with a guild. Solo this game is a horrible frustrating experience.
13452	the balancing is dogshit and has been for every patch of this game
13453	'Yeah, horribly subject dude. May you burn in hell.  Oh wait, I think you're there already.'  Actual response from devs when asked a question in the 'actual forums' from top dev.
13454	I paid into this as a founder as what was promised looked awesome. I don't see how the devs can say this is ready for release. It's buggy, unbalanced clearly not finished. Graphics have improved but thats about it. I feel like the y just stole my money as this not the Wahammer 40k game that was promised.
13455	Bought the game and crashed every single time, on every setting i tried, and 100% of loading into any match. Rubbish. My computer also is 2xs the recommended to play it.
13456	Soulless, bland feeling lobby-based third person shooter.  I'm a huge fan of the warhammer 40k universe. This game does not feel like 40k at all. It feels like a f2p ripoff of Space Marine's multiplayer.  Also of important note: the graphics don't look at all like they show in the screenshots.
13457	Just throwing this out there. The game has been rushed and is still a Beta imo. And is nowhere near the Â£40 price tag they are asking for it. Had this game since founders and played 5 hours in total... Considering I am a diehard 40K that has to say something. (Will change if game becomes decent) at the moment though STAY AWAY
13458	Game runs terribly (I have a Gtx 1080, 4770k oc'd to 4ghz, 16g ram) on ultra for 3440x1440 hovers between 30-45 fps. The combat feels terrible, everything just feels clunky, gunplay is some of the worst I've experienced in a 'shooter' to date. Honestly there is nothing positive I can recommend about this game its just not fun, it runs badly, and everything including the animations are clunky. Just go play Planetside 2, its what this game tried and ultimately failed to be.
13459	Goodness, where to begin.  After playing a few of the Alpha (or beta, I can't remember) builds, then moving on to the release, and I use that term lightly, there were a few glaring issues that has kept me from playing the game.  1.) Persistent world: Last I checked, this 'persistent world' was represented by a very barebones map. Only a few actual 'maps' exist, and they aren't tied together. 2.) Campaigns: The so-called 'massive campaigns' involve, for PVE, a few rooms you hold out in against waves of Tyranid enemies. The PvP campaign is completely non-existant. 3.) Balance: The balance, or lack thereof, is attrocious. Melee is overpowered, heavy weapons are much too ponderous, and the magicks are, from what I remember, completely broken.   In all, I wouldn't reccommend this game to anyone, not as a full release game, anyway.
13460	As it stands, I don't recommend this game. It has a lot of potential, and hopefully in time it will be as great as it deserves to be. Hoping for the best.
13461	As much as I love Warhammer 40000 . . . Lag, poor optimization, and clunky controls make it really tough to enjoy this game.
13462	Right now this is a game that is in beta. Not fully released or not worth the money.  The lag is really bad. Seeing people teleport is a common occurance. This coupled with melee means that melee characters plow through people. I just had a chaos melee guy with an axe kill not 2, not 3, but 4 space marines. All the while teleporting around.  The balance is a bit of a joke. Defenders say 'learn the melee'. What if I don't want to melee. Why am I constantly forced into melee combat. No matter what map, you will end up fighting people in melee. No matter the class. Just earlier I was playing medica, melee guy tried to attack me, I stuned him, and he instantly teleported behind me. Sooo funn. Then you have weapons that will kill you either instantly or in 2 hits. That's not fun. No matter the game, 1 hit or 2 hit guys (especially in an infantry focused game) is not fun. Space Marines vs Eldar. More than half of their team was melee and just cut through us like butter. Wasn't even a competition. Wasn't even fun. As far as I'm aware, Space Marines seem to be the worse race at the moment. All of the other races have really strong aspects to them.   Matchmaking is questionable. I'm not even sure if there is any. If there is, I have no idea how they do it. I've been in games where we just get massacred. One game the other team's #1 player had 25 kills. Our top kills? 10. They're top 4 players had more kills than our best player.   The games classes are even more confusing. I don't even know what half the stuff on my premade class does. I can't tell. There's no tooltips for gear, as far as I'm aware.   Melee is just way too easy. Not only do the melee classes get pretty good protection (speed, agility, flying, shields, etc). They also get a lock on. So once they get within medium range, they dont even have to worry about aiming! There's 3 buttons. Quick attack, strong attack, parry attack. That's all there is to it for melee. There should either be no lock on, or ranged also gets a lock on at close range. It just seems like a super hard gimmick so that melee classes 'counter' ranged classes.    This came could be good. But with lack of gear, lack of maps, bugs, horrible lag, melee dominating every engagement, and overall a lack of satisfaction while playing; this game will be sitting on the back burner of my list. I'll probably come down to check the updates and maybe give it a try with a different faction.
13463	How to balance things, guide by people who knows how to make promises, not games. Melee players have autoaim and big damage. Ranged players have to aim manually and have pathetic damage. Also sick netcode and hitreg. Good luck hitting anything but map.
13464	Should honestly AT LEAST still be in a beta phase of development.
13465	Gameplay is okay. but currently the servers are the worst problem the game has currently. I do not recommend buying until further down the line. 'Technical Beta' is too lenient of a title to call this right now. Alpha 2.0 is more accurate.
13466	No, sorry. Maybe Later.
13467	I can only think of two words for this game....  Cluster F**k.  Wait for it to be on sale. And if you are into PvE, just over look it all around.
13468	No, sorry. Maybe Later.
13469	I can only think of two words for this game....  Cluster F**k.  Wait for it to be on sale. And if you are into PvE, just over look it all around.
13470	Top 10 biggest lies on Steam.
13471	Been following this game since it was just a site. Bought it as soon as it was on steam. Sadly nothing important they promised made to this game. Not even a fully functional client... Game still feels as clunky and unfinished as the first day its alpha was released. And I find it extremely disrespectful that they released a game like this to such a loyal and passionate group of followers that have been active and supportive in the game's development. Not to mention the price for such an incomplete game... I will not be buying a single warhammer product in order to support devs or the IP from now on, I will only buy when it has been relesed and proven to be complete. This is beyond releasing a game with bugs, this is more on the level of no man's sky... Do not buy this game
13472	I literally can't bring to words...HOW MUCH OF A LET DOWN THIS IS!  I feel like I was lied to and cheated...deliberately.  Screw all of you developers who use the 'Hillary Clinton' tactic of saying whatever you have to in order to get what you want; in this case...our money.  You want to know how disappointing this is?...I'll try to give you an example....  Imagine you're a kid again and you're about to get the one thing you always wanted for your birthday....only you unwrap it and find out that someone had â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ all over it and it's missing pieces.  That's what this is...our dream game...shattered and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ on.  I would recommend grabbing some sticks and a marble and playing Pong IRL before buying this game.
13473	This game has just released. However, the game is still an Alpha in terms of quality.   Apart from the 40k license this game has no positive values what so ever .  Avoid like the plague!
13474	Needs works, poorly balanced, lots of bugs, wildly inaccurate and unstable aiming, this game has the potential to be good but its many months worth of patches away from reaching that point
13475	This game is NOT ready. it is NOT what we were initially promised.  i dunno if Bandai forced them to get it out the gate, but whoever made that call was wrong and the game will now die because of it. in no way is this game even close to being worth Â£40.  i'll keep checking back as they release patches, no doubt the money will keep them doing that for a bit. but in the land of cod and battlefield, a launch like this is literally death.
13476	i originally wrote a rather *rough* review of this game. i deleted that since the game has been released.  my original review however was entailing how the community was painfully naive thinking that a game that was being taken from Alpha to release in a matter of months would be anywhere near a complete or bug free experience. I am happy to say however I have been pleasantly surprised by the developers progress despite announcing they were fast tracking the game to 'release'. MY claim still holds true however, the game is incomplete, unbalanced and unoptimized on nearly every level, but there is good potential at its core.   However, between the prototypical fanboyish naive players that make up a good chunk of the community, the developers questionable decisions and communication regarding the progress, development plan and future of the game and the very high asking price of what is still completely an unfinished early access game i would be dishonest if i was to say i recommend investing in this game in anyway.   We shall see what the future holds but I would not hold my breath on this game living up to its potential or even promised features due to it being 'released' and still being an utter shell of a game. Sad, I would love a proper large scale WH40k PVP game. Back to space marine it is for now!
13477	Lets start with basic introduction. (Sorry for my English) I am huge Warhammer fan. I have more than 38k points army in total. Including 10k Eldar, 10k Space Wolves, 15k Necrons, and some random small squads consisting of Chaos, Dark Angels, Harlequins and so on. Not to mention huge LotR collection and some Age of Shitmar figures. Done with that.    Early Acces
13478	The game has very good warhammer-style combat in alot of ways. However, what makes this unplayable is the broken melee system. See, In the game's earlier inspiration, Space Marine, a smart player can easily roll out of the way of a melee attacker and wait for his melee pattern to be on cooldown since after 3 successive attacks, there's a small period before you're able to strike again, making melee a tactic of skill and suprise butt-freakery. In EC, it's a complete 180; random Eldar Scorpions and Ork Sluggas can simply spam melee with no cooldowns, while your ability to dodge is limited to about 2 combat rolls (seriously, your default stamina only allows 2 combat rolls before it needs to regen. like, wtf?). After those rolls are up, you can only hope your melee spam can endlessly parry (yes, they thought it was a good idea to add a parry mechanic when melee strikes don't have stamina, so you both end up spamming melee with infinite parries) theirs before either you or they recieve some assistance from a ranged soldier to gun their opponent down.
13479	  Between the unbalanced factions, the clunky gameplay, the server perfomance issues, and that the developers are just bringing out new content instead of fixing the base issues of the game, I do not recommend purchasing this.

13484	The game right now doesnt feel playable. Server lags like 90% of the time plus game play is choppy even with medium setting and i have a i5-6600k and a nvidia 980ti with 32 gb of ram. Until they fix the game i dont think ill be touching this game
13485	As someone who has played this game for quite a while i've got to say that right now this games is NOT worth the current price. I've played it since it first hit steam in it's early access state and let me tell you, back then was waaaaaaaaaaaay preferable to what they have now. over time it's really become a mess. melee is OP as hell and guns don't really feel statisfying. You can be easily be taken out by melee even after empting half of your MINITURE ROCKETS into their face. There is a HUGE list of things wrong with this game but you can read other reviews for those lists. All in all to save yourself the money and trouble and come back to check on it in about half a year to a year. Maybe then it'll be in a state of quality of a decent beta.
13486	- Concurrent users around 400-500 (EU) - Matchmaking so broken that it can't even count and you end up with 15 Orks vs 20 Space Marines - Performance issues where you have to tweak the game yourself to make it run properly  - Leading as a bad example of poorly implemented asymmetric classes/races - Ludicrously expensive cash shop for cosmetics and even unique weapons - no balance melee vs ranged (melee &gt; ranged)  The only good thing the game has going for it is the 40K name. At this point we should all know that GW is tossing out licenses to whoever can afford it. There is no sense of quality. I was really hoping for a game set in 40K that is something else than another RTS.  Since it is a multiplayer only game and the playerbase is slowly dwindling, the future is pretty obvious. But given the state of the game there is not enough time, effort and probably money left.  If you really wanna get it, set a 110 minute alarm on your phone and reconsider at that point if you think the game is worth it or you rather want to refund it.

13490	The dissapointment is palitable. Just no.
13491	The game is simply a Battlefield rip-off with w40k elements. That would be OK but unfortuantely it does not feel as smooth as BF. Driving vehicles is no fun. Everything feels chunky to me, no idea if it is the net code or something else. Will give it some time as today is just one day after release.
13492	I am a huge 40k fan, enjoyed the warhammer fantasy mmo, dawn of war series, the space marine stand alone game, and enjoy the models. The issue I have with this game is that it is a far cry from what was promised. The initial idea of a 40k mmo was a lofty one but hard to replicate, and after a series of compromises and shortfalls, this is what we were given. Unfortunately the game play itself is unplayable, or glitchy at best. The menus are just as sluggish and unintuitive as the game itself. This game is a perfect example of why its poor judgement to preorder before results are presented. My short time playing showed that there are a number of folks who are having fun with it, and doing well (recommend any race other than marines unfortunately as they are rather bulky and slow) but the playing curve is rather harsh- either learn the glitchy mechanics and grind, or get frustated and quit. I hope the devs can fix the myriad of issues with this game, and salvage something, but it might be too little too late. It was a nice idea while it lasted. 40k fans, play space marine if you want a good shooter that actually has a campaign, the pvp is severely depleted but atleast it doesn't function with perpetual lag. Otherwise, save your money, this is another poor digital product in the franchise with the sole hope that the fanbase would support it blindly without any from the developers itself.
13493	Don't bother. Another failed MMP combat fiasco. There is no seperation between new players and old. I followed around an orc shooting it in the back with the default bolter for a good 10 seconds and his health bar didn't move because he was fully geared with a lot of advancements. He turned, clubed me once and I was dead. These games that do not have Point Caps are just masochistic and LAZY or incompetent developers. Also the graphics are really sub-par for a modern game. I mean like really sub-par.
13494	Buyer beware, indeed.  At the time of posting this, the game has 237 concurrent players. Save your money and spend it on a game that isn't tanking hard.  I really do want the game to improve/survive but it does not look like it will happen under the current dev team. A shame.
13495	Launched the game and everything seemed fine. Make my account, create my first character, start up the tutorial.... Game crashes. I think, 'Fine, the game is still being made, so I can understand a bug or two.' Relaunch the game, can't find an option anywhere to relaunch the tutorial. Great, whatever. Decide to just join a match. Get in, and the game runs great. Graphics aren't too bad and I'm getting a solid 50-60 frames. Then I try the combat and..... I'm very disappointed. It all seemed lacking. There was also no team communication whatsoever. My overall opinion on it thus far: Decent graphics, somewhat stable engine, bad combat, bad community.
13496	An overpriced unpolished, unbalanced, unoptimized, and unfun lobby shooter - pretending to be a AAA title.  I had high hopes for this game even from Alpha testing but it has shaped up to be one of the biggest messes I've seen in a long time.  I expect this game will go F2P in the future - and even then it wouldn't be worth your time.
13497	Playing this game is just a constant headache for me. Unless youve got a group of 5-10 guys to stomp the random opponents its just not enjoyable on its own. Controls are clunky and comparable driving an old hunk of junk from the 40's. Combat is just frustrating and devolves into simple (click repeatidly) mechanics. Weapons either take 15+ shots to drop your opponents to their knees (focus fire) or 1 shot to finish them all off with (AoE). The consistant lag and framerate drops despite your PC managing to run it smoothly every other instance. Every animation and action gets you stuck in that animation or stunned. (I think I spend more time being stunned by allies or enemies or simply by long overdrawn animations.)  Objectives and maps are just frustrating in design allowing for little or no strategy. Not that you'll have any time to really think about what your doing. Its been months since this game 'launched' and its still in no better condition than day 1 of the alpha, they just add weapons and cosmetics and change systems to whatever flavor of the month it is.  The game is just weapons and cosmetics and content smashed all together with no solid balance or planning inside a small instance with 2-4 objectives that you have to capture in 5 minutes each.  Do not buy this game. Developers need to understand that if they want to sell a product it should be on par with games of its type or better. Add this game to your watch list and keep an eye on its development. Maybe in a year itll be worthwhile. Or maybe itll be free by then.
13498	The only game i have ever requested a refund for.
13499	Why did I purchase this when everyone warned me, but the forums are full of haters they said. I now understand why. Save your money.
13500	Updated-See Below  You are most likely reading this as a fan of Warhammer 40k. You also know that online games of the franchise are few and far between. Keep that in mind as you continue reading.  I bought the game in Early Access, and at first, was tempted to give a scathing review. Bugs everywhere, serious balance issues, lag that was game breaking, and lackluster customization options were just some of the points I was going to cover. I decided it really wasn't fair to review a game which (in it's own words) wasn't even finished. So I decided to wait until the launch.  In that almost 3 weeks, I have seen multiple patches that not only addressed the above mentioned issues, but others I didn't mention. The developer, BeHavior, was working as fast as possible to meet the deadline set by Bandai Namco. And the speed at which it was done is a credit to them. So much so, that I believe an exorcism may be needed for whatever infernal blood contract they signed.  But this isn't a Dev review. It's a game review.  You came here because of Warhammer 40k. So we will judge it using that.  From the start, there is a LOT missing from the franchise. Less than half the factions are represented, weapons are missing, the maps are all urban based, and your favorite sub-faction may not be included. But it has been stated that (over the course of time), these may be addressed also. Which is good news, but doesn't help you right now.  When we strip away everything that is 40k, and replace it with obligatory WW2 themes, weapons, vehicles and maps, we are left with a lackluster lobby shooter that couldn't compete with others of the same type.  So Warhammer 40k is the only element that will keep this game alive. Which is good for the fans. Like you.  In my almost three weeks of playing, there have been many changes and advancements in development. If that momentum and drive continues, BeHavior has the opportunity to make this into a GREAT addition to any 40k library.  Warhammer 40k online games are not in great abundance. But I would rather have a few great games than a horde of horrible ones. And this one has the potential to be great. It will take time, work, and perhaps even renewing that blood contract- but I do think it will happen.  UPDATE-  It has been over a month since the launch, with several patches going back and forth with 'balance' changes. Unfortunately, the MAJOR issues aren't being addressed, or even commented upon. As such, I have to change my review. The premise was great, but the holes in the foundation are making this game fall apart. It isn't a lobby shooter, it's a lobby meleer. The significant balance gap between ranged and melee can be demonstrated in the following-  1) Melee Lock-On This allows melee players to lock-on to a target, basically allowing them to strafe around the target and spam melee attacks. They generally move faster around you than you can turn, and unless you are melee, you have no ability to lock onto them.  2) Unlimited Jump Packs Basically, if you have a Jump Pack equipped, you can soar into the air and cover a great deal of real estate or get past a defended position. It is difficult to shoot someone mid flight, and they can end the usage once the first bullet hits. The 'fuel' for the pack replenishes quickly, allowing them to practically go anywhere they want.  3) No resource usage for melee attacks If I shoot at you, I expend ammunition. Eventually, I run out and have to resupply somehow. Melee has no 'stamina' gauge that limits the amount of attacks they can do. They can literally wail on a tank all day long and never get tired.  4) Melee doesn't appear on radar If you sprint, use a jump pack, or fire a gun, you appear on enemy radar. However, you can kill an entire capture point worth of enemies with your power fist and never show up on radar. Ever. You can literally go the entire match not even showing up on enemy radar.  5) Capture points are inside rooms Almost every capture point is inside a structure, making close quarters combat not only needed, but extremely powerful. Generally, ranged weapons are fairly useless at these points, because once the melee enemy is at the area, you are dead.  6) Transports Transports are used for instant deployment to wherever the transport is. While I understand the need for them, it allows players to circumvent massive areas of the maps, covering miles of terrain in some maps. While I understand the need for the 'feature' (which anyone familiar with tabletop would recognize as every unit having Deep Strike), it contributes to the next issue-  7) Maps have FAR too much cover While there are areas on maps that have wide open areas to fill people full of holes, these are generally bypassed due to transports (see above). All other areas have far too much cover, allowing enemies to simply ignore the fact you want to shoot them. You can move to a new area, but so can they.  The general responses to the above issues are the obligatory 'git gud', coupled with the chants of melee-centric premades of 'use teamwork!'. Those responses, however, are from the dwindling, but diehard, 40K fans who refuse to give in into the fact that the game will never be what they envisioned or paid for. Their blind fanaticism forces them to clutch onto the 'future', as they are watching a loved one die in a hospital bed.  Numerous negative game reviews- (just look for yourselves). Developers who refuse to change what 'they' think the game should be. Absolutely no endgame- At rank 5 for every faction, you win! Increasing queue timers, because people are quitting the game. No actual game direction, outside of getting a turd polished for console release.  Still want to buy it?  Spend that money elsewhere, because you are only paying for life support for this game.
13501	It's not bad, for 40K standards but it still feels unfinished.  It takes forever to level up, the points you get to buy things are weirdly distributed. Wait till it's on sale
13502	UPDATE: I built a new pc- top of the line ground up and can play no problem- But the FPS issues are still there for those who lack a strong processor. untill that issue is fixed- i would say dont buy unless u have and i7   I have been watching this game for some time but unforunatly its to unoptimized to even play. horrible FPS lag even when going into the files and manually changing the video settings. At this point i cant recommend it
13503	Much we were promised, little we got.  At it's prestent state this game isn't finished and should be in Beta.  -Unbalanced -Buggy -not enough content -Server Problems -Sound is bad  I put much money in a founder pack and i feel ripped off.  I hope they can still save this game, but until then this game isn't worth its price.   
13504	I will never recommend this game to ANYONE. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! I have given you a fair warning, now I am going to break the game down to explain why... incoming rant about bad design...  First of all, this type of game relies HEAVILY on weapon balance. These French Canadian amateurs (developers) have no idea what they are doing with the balance. Only one faction ever really wins any match, meaning its pointless to play anything but that once faction... Thats right devs, if you still have not figured it out... SPACE MARINES!!!!  But hey, if everyone played space marines, there would actually be zero matches. Why? well its faction vs faction. You cant have two space marine teams beating each other down... Problem here is that the most basic of all space marine weapon, the bolter, is 5x as powerful as the ork and eldar basic rifles. A fully modded shurikan catapault does 1/5th the damage as an unmodified bolter... Which is unacceptable under any circumstance.  There is a lack of game modes and maps. They say there will be 100+ player battles but... guess what... there are never enough players to have 100+ player battles so... Why? Because most people are not stupid enough to buy a broken game upon launch. Fix it later? How did that work out for you guys?  The game was buggy on launch, they have fixed only half of the bugs. There are still instances where my character glitches while bracing on a ledge, or dodges in a weird way. The movement is fragged, the animation is even more broken than it was upon launch.  There is a reason why there are so many bugs, to this day... These amateurs (I will never call them developers as they have proven they are incompetent twits), decided to change their engine, 90% through the development process, from unreal 3 to 4. They simply copied and pasted the code, which lead to some very terrible optimization issues.  Back in founder access, I gave them the benefit of the doubt. For six months, the game was nearly unplayable due to â¥â¥â¥â¥ poor optimization with players on even the top tier computers getting 10-14 fps... Thats right, people with a 980ti were getting 14 fps... making it unplayable and as a result, unable to be tested by the beta testers... So there is the real reason it had such a crappy launch. Dumb developers, doing dumb things, with a launch date set by idiots at namco bandai.  Look, I interned for gearbox, I have worked for several startup game design compies as well... I currently work in indie game design. I know how the engines work, I know how the software integrates with the hardware, and I know how to properly optimize 3d models and particle effects... AND I KNOW THAT A QUICK COPY AND PASTE OF THE CODE FROM A DIFFERENT ENGINE VERSION WILL NOT WORK!!!!!!! At least not without some changes...  Maybe it was just bad timing on their end, but they really have zero excuses for the state of this game. Like I said, dont bother buying it. Let it fade into the warp, where the game, and its developers, belong.
13505	horrid gameplay. space marine is 100x better.
13506	 Early Access Review
13507	 Early Access Review
13508	 Early Access Review
13509	I made a middle of the road review before, But II am stepping away from the game., I would not buy at this time, come back later..
13510	Im on the fence with this one. This game definitely has the potential to be great, but its not great right now. It looks pretty decent, and the PvP combat is pretty enjoyable. However there are some serious balancing issues, and there are some questions to be asked about the networking. Its not the game that was advertised, and it feels more like a beta version that has a lot of kinks that need ironing out.  Has potential, but right now..... meh.
13511	Still sadly has quite a ways to go optimization wise.
13512	I tried to like this game so much, but it's absolutely horrible - there's no other way to describe it. I've been playing real Warhammer 40k for 23 years now, so I was super excited to play a 40k MMO, but this was just a rushed, poorly made and badly executed attempt. It's just atrocious. I have an ASUS ROG laptop that can play almost anything, yet this game is choppy/clunky. Melee combat is a clickfest and killing something with a ranged weapon is basically a fluke. Furthermore, Space Marines can be downed by almost every weapon with ease, and are able to bleed out (in 40k lore, Space Marine wounds instantly auto clot...yet Marines bleed out in seconds in this game). In real 40k, Space Marine power armour can stop an autocannon round 66% of the time, with zero damage to the wearer...yet in this game, a couple chainsword swipes or a burst of bolter rounds can instantly drop one of the Emperor's Finest. It's ridiculous. It feels like Paper Armour, not Power Armour, and it certainly does not feel like WH40k. I tried so hard to like the game, but I can't justify wasting precious time playing this disaster anymore. And mark my words: it is a disaster. Actually it's even worse - it's Heresy. We were betrayed. If I could get a refund I would.
13513	Got the game on launch day, the performance was dire but at least there was a bit of a player count.  The most recent patches seem to have made the FPS much much smoother, at the expense of latency.   It is incredibly hard to play as a melee character when you constantly have 200ms lag.  Also the game is incredibly boring when you are constantly against space marines, as somebody who plays as eldar I can't actually remember the last time I played against chaos or orks. Even then we seem to play most matches with 50% less players than our space marine opponents.  If this game was cheaper on launch and had the FPS performance it dose now then there might be enough players to make this game fun. As it stands it feels like the servers hosting my games are on the moon and there isn't anybody playing. Which is a shame because the game is actually pretty fun when it works.  If it's on sale and you like 40K, buy it, otherwise steer clear. At least untill the latency issues get fixed.
13514	This game needs more work, particularly in terms of optimization.   I've been monitoring it for 3 years or more but bought i just a few days ago. It has been through hell when it comes to failed promises and princing.   I thought it might be in a more decent state, but I was wrong.  It was in a state of pre-alpha for a year and then went straight to release. Possible issues with publisher, but getting screwed isn't particularly fun for the customer either.   pros -4 factions -some interesting in idea maps -few games like it -rare third person territory control game, if you like this sort of thing this might one day be the go to game -the one huge map in the game is interestingly designed and offers some last stand sort of scenario that you rarely get in this game  cons -tons of features to be added, it has  -terrible optimization, this is a not what you can call a really pretty game, but it hogs resources like no other, official forums have a ton of people complaining about being barely capable of running it and fixes are rarely found -pricing - not only is the price high, but every current customization option is behind a paywall. Furthermore there is an ingame resource outside of the normal currency that you get a little of and the rest is only possible to but with cash. Right now all customization of looks happens through that paid currency.   Like in a F2P game, but this is not a F2P game. -LOOTBOXES the game has lootboxes and the devs are experimenting with them right now. No idea what goes on in their heads.  -menus- generally sluggish, not always registering clicks, slow navigation when equipping loadouts, which takes some time when you have stuff to add. Additionally most store weapon pictures barely fit the look of the store, so it looks like some amateur work. -world map- currently a horrendous small drawing where instead of of a huge map you just have small chunks with 2 factions each, where every faction gets to fight every other faction. Like some sort of testing version. -movement - slow, turning is difficult, you are like a freight train  - you cannot jump brcause the forum fanboys thought it was a bad idea some years ago(or they simply defended a bad idea by the developes), now you *vault*, but said vaulting works only in particular spots of terrain so sometimes what is a small terrain obstacle becomes really difficult to navigate. Some even lack vault points and force you to run around them.  - despite all of this slashing with you close combat weapon can sometimes get you to reach a running opponent and your swings take you forward almost as fast as running, they are apparently still testing this -combat - heavy focus on close combat, abysmall aiming for most weapons  -aiming weapons from cover to lowerground and shooting them looks like it works but for my grenade launcher as an ork my rockets dissapear or do no damage, so that is horrendously bugged at the moment  -shooting sort of works but at times I feel like they just dumbed it down for consoles, even sniper weapons have some long load times in which you have to keep the target in sight for 3 seconds or more and it's quite difficult because lose target for 1 second and you have to redo that 1 second of aiming at him to get 1 shot off, lascannon completely different from space marine lascannon  -close combat  -fast swings, heavy swings and parry of some sort. Parry sometimes works, sometimes doesn't, it seems to still be in a testing stage.  -fast swings clash with each other and often combat ends up you clashing someone until your friends help  -weapons can break for short periods of time and recover soon after, shields break too which is very odd as a design choice, perhaps to nerf them even though all AoE stuff still hits you  -maps are designed to favor close combat, shooting down a mele player before he gets to you is not all that easy, especially considering jump packs/shields and abysmal weapon spread(oh and some nurgle class has ridiculous HP bonus, if you see him getting close just run and shoot when you have small windows of oppportunity, never face him head on, he will kill you)  customization  - items are being added, there is definitely more stuff than before, but it is taking a long long while, some slots simply lack options and you can't even grind for these  additional issues:  -some imbalances between faction, for a while the eldar were the top dog since their models are half the normal size of other factions yet hp was close to them, they got somewhat nerfed, orks got buffed in terms of hp, it will still take a while for balance to be fully done  networking issues - disconnects, general lag etc. For something that you want to have massive battles in, you cannot allow such networking issues.  models - some models look pretty damn bad, eldar in particular, the female versions of eldar look like the male version with a pair of breasts slapped on the front  I am probably missing something, there is so much wrong with it, it's hard to remember everything.     I will change this review to positive if this game improves a lot, but I cannot lie to myself like the people on the official forums did all this time. This game is in a really rough state with tons of features missing. A beta at best. Yes you can probably have fun with it, but is still an incomplete buggy game, that may or may not survive enough time to become what it was promised.  And some of the work just seems amateurish.
13515	 Early Access Review
13516	I'll be honest the game is fun but if you are not a big fan of Warhammer 40k franchise i would suggest to wait a few months before even considering buying this game.  The game is currently not enjoable as a TPS 'Lobby' shooter because you just get sick of dying from OHK weapons which are spammed by the enemy team in atleast 90% of the games you play. If you played for a long time and you finally unlocked a veteran class?Again OHK even by friendlies and most annoying of this?You only get 2 deployments of it. Also let me add that the game is very 'melee' most of the time if you think you can capture a point as a ranged class?????You are in for a suprise to see that your combat knife is a butter knife and you die in two hits because enemy composition is 95% melee.   Again nothing beats being a Space Marine and executing a greenskin with a powerfist...NOTHING!
13517	Unfortunately this game is not what it should be. I don't even want to mention the original concept with open world and so on. The devs didn't even deliver the content they've promised at the launch date. Still no campaigns, horde mode bugged horribly, balance doesn't exist, just a few maps, no elite classes, crappy controls. This game needs lots of work yet. Great potential but it seems it'll be wasted ;/
13518	How to I get a refund
13519	I can now confirm, despite all my hopes, this game runs like â¥â¥â¥.  You know, I love warhammer, and I really wanted to love this game as well. However, in the state it's in, I absolutely can't recommend it. I have a high end PC that can run Fallout 4 on highest settings and consistantly get 60FPS, but in this game it struggles to pull off a solid 30 on high (not ultra) graphics settings and a 1600x900 resolution. The combat is really great though, the gunplay and the somewhat in-depth melee system. The vehicles are also very cool, similar to what you'd see in battlefield minus the aircraft and light jeeps and such. I thought the the territory map and gameplay idea was fairly interesting. The game's concepts are all pretty good, but it's just how the game runs for me, not to mention the game crashes to desktop every time i exit a game lobby.  In summary, don't buy the game now. Wait until further patches and when the reviews start to get positive.  *Update: After updating my drivers, I have managed to get it at least close to 60FPS on high settings 1920x1080, but then again keep in mind I am using a GTX 980Ti. Also, the crashing to desktop after games still hasn't fixed.
13520	TL:DNR = Simply just not fun due to amazingly poor design choices.  This game has gone through several gigs of updates and changes, yet the game is still broken as all hell. Melee is still incredibly overpowered, along with the melee combat system simply just doesnt work. Light, heavy and kick as your abilities do not flow smoothly at all, heavy attacks take far too long to charge and have little payoff.  The level up system is so token, that every time I was able to build up enough points to get an upgrade, I couldn't tell that literally any difference was made. Many of which just reduce loadout weights, yet the only one that I'm even ABLE to to put too much on is the healer, and all the upgrades combined don't make a difference to what I can bring with me. So why do these upgrades exist at all when they dont add up to be helpful?  For some reason 5 rounds from pistols do inexcusably more damage than 40 rounds from a machine gun.  Rifles are so wildly inaccurate that you can miss 8 of 10 shots on an enemy only 15 feet away.  Plasma canons will decide where they wish to land, instead of player choice.  The sheer number of times I've spawned inches from an enemys gun, thus instantly dieing, truely amazing.  Shield enemies are virtually immortal with very little to combat this mechanic.  Defense maps are near guarenteed loss if the attacking team has a luke warm brain, as taking the first objective grants far too much time to the clock, and does not give any extra defense lives. Your team can hold the attackers off until the last 5 seconds, and lose all but 70 respawns, all of which being meaningless the second they take the first objective. The first objective, which is behind a massive wall, is also inexcusably easy to breach.  Eldar are effectively unbeatable as their mechanics are far more mobile, and deal far more damage, from far further than any other class. You might think this means they are the ranged class, youd be wrong. Their melee is also the strongest in the game, and the fastest.  If you play chaos, dont expect any help from your team. My experience playing with their community, entire groups of people will walk right passed downed allies, healers will only heal themselves, which is directly due to the fact that far too many people use the Khorn mark. A team based game, far too many people will pick a tiny incrase to health steal, even when it means they cant be healed by healers who do the job far faster.  Playing eldar was effectively just easy mode.  Playing orks, brute force wins the day, even though they just feel like the worst of everything.  Playing space marines is effectively the exact same as chaos, except every 1 in 100 allies will actually work together.  The community is effectively just a hundred people playing single player fighting in a free for all. Team work yields no tangible reward.
13521	eternal PVP how boring
13522	The game is so bad that the store page attempts to represent the game. Slow, laggy, and unresponsive.  Seriously though, why is the store page so laggy?
13523	Game is funny, don't get me wrong, but there is abolutly nothing ingame what has been told. Also it is damn expensive and there are still microtransactions! Thats just insolent! I hope the devs change something and deliver or they fail with this one. I really wish the game will be as good as it could have been, but at this point I can't recommend it. The devs got enough money and it's time they deliver! It's funny that they call themselves 'Behaviour Interactive' while their own behaviour is absolutely ignorant and greedy
13524	This game does have potential and I hope it gets better, which is why I originally left a positive review, but after having played as much as I can stomach (12 hours since the Beta), I'm not holding my breath. I deleted my previous review, which I considered a hesitant, but optimistic 'Yes', and am re-posting my review as a cautious 'No' due to the current state of the game.  As an early backer, we were promised PlanetSide 2 but with a Warhammer 40K paint job and RPG-level characters and customization, and that's really what a lot of the negative reviews boil down to... expectation versus reality.  A background map that is periodically updated with moving zones of control based on the wins and losses of the paired factions is not what most of us consider a 'persistant world', especially when you can't actually interact with the world depicted on said map and are instead restricted to the same maps match after match. Being able to customize your character with a very limited number of micro-transaction items and to unlock other skill/items via progression, does not make this an MMO either.  I hope it improves, but unless you're like me and bought into the early crowd-funding and are now stuck with it, then hold off on buying it until the developers are forced to improve it to a point where it at least somewhat resembles the original vision statements... or is even fun.
13525	Terrible game overral. They didn't deliver: Failed to keep their engagement. Removed special items to Founders. Very poor grapgic and clumsy gameplay.  Liars, incompetents, uncaring. They should have stick to their patethic Disney games instead of trying to make a real one.
13526	eyyy i bought this game for a hope of something similar to warhammer online from mythic's amazing hands, instead i got warhammer space marine multiplayer on persistant maps. garbage. oh wait come to find out, they didnt even deliever persistance, do not buy this is a jape game
13527	Laggy broken close combat I had hope for this game but its just not good and I would love to try to play it if it wasn't so darn laggy.
13528	this game is an unbalanced mess! if you like warhammer 40k then do not buy this game. its not worthy of the 40k banner. i have had many issues with this game. balancing is nowhere to be seen. and ive glitched under the map, through walls and randomly die for no reason. maybe in a few years itll be a good or even a great game. but right now its a terrible game.
13529	Abysmal game. Ask yourself this question, why am I playing this and not Space Marine. Granted you can 'play' other races here, if you're willing to stomach animation 101 class level animation, ridiculous lighting (you'll know), and the dumbest, least inventive and most unrewarding addition to 3rd person shooters ever.
13530	Pros: Funny voices. It's WH 40k themed.  Cons: Total lack of balance in the game. Loaded with bugs in combat. Loaded with bugs in item store and character advancement. Awful UI. Simple things like arranging a squad with guild mates is stupidly difficult. Game map objectives often impossible. Constant lag spikes.  Summary: Must try harder. 
13531	the game is a real â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥how
13532	The game was released to soon thats the bottom line. Given 2 more month this would have been at a stage to go beta. The game has its high points such as its a Warhammer 40k Title. But right now it needs love from the Devs and the community. Let it mature and we will have a fun 40k shooter.
13533	It has potential, can be pretty fun if you play with friends but i would recomend checking it out in a few months but wouldn't get my hopes too high because the devs are too attached to some bad design choices like lock-on, auto aim and a Rock, Paper, Scissors melee system that works very poorly for duels and even poorer in big battles.
13534	Honestly, this game is not worth 40$, not with how much the Devs promised, then up and went and backpeddaled on nearly all of them.  At best, this would be the kind of purchase you make when its on sale and they really need the cash, and by that I mean its not worth more than 10$ at best. I really wish this couldve been the game they had the vision and dreams for, but with how much they are overbuffing 1 faction, and letting the other 3 fall behind, the blantant unprofessionalism from the devs(one takes it upon himself to bring his personal life into discussion quite often, and if he isnt doing that, hes insulting the community on the forums.), and quite frankly, they continue to SNAFU the game with every patch, claiming bug fixes, people get in game and said bug fixes are worse than before.  This is all I feel about the game after having gotten it back in july, and playing up until now.  Do not waste your time with this game, Deathwing, Dawn of War (any of them), Space Marine, hell, even that chess one, are all better purchases than this steaming pile of warp spawn.
13535	IÂ´m not the person who write long reviews or explain in details, so IÂ´m going to cut it short.   Game control: Feels very clumsy, doesnt feel very genuine (look down below about fps).  FPS: The game is poorly optimized, IÂ´m running a 1070 nvidia graphic card and can run most games in ultra settings, Im running this game in high and it freezes for me time to time (for a couple of seconds), and if theres more then 10 players around the FPS suffers alot and it drops like a maniac.  Refund? If i had a chance to refund I would do that but itÂ´s to late. Just sad they ruin the Warhammer 40k franchise so much that I consider sending a mail to Games workshop asking what they where thinking to allow Relic release this 'still-beta-game' and Its really sad saying it, since IÂ´ve been a Warhammer 40k player (the board game) for over 10 years now.
13536	 Early Access Review
13537	The game is fun, no doubt about that.  But im sick of devs/publishers releasing games too early or just plain out lying.  This is a husk of what it was supposed to be and now since the game is Â´Â´LaunchedÂ´Â´ they cant claim they are working on it and that it will be there soon, a game at release should actually be done.  Hopefully one day this will actually be Warhammer 40K Eternal Crusade, but right now it is not and it is not fair to release it and just wait and pay for it to become better down the line.  PS, i dont know if its the devs themselves or the publishers that made this happen, but what matters is that you should not spend your money on promises.
13538	Would refund if I hadnt got a founder pack. I backed for an planetside 40k not this lobby shooter
13539	So yeah this is the first review that I have written in my long time with steam, and all I can say is that this is the first game that has made me hate it enough to write a review. Now I got this when it went into early access but have been following it for years since it was announced. This game made big promises and has delivered on none of them. The melee combat is broken, you die to friendly grenades more than anything, and if you are getting this to play the space marines......don't. They never win a single game. All I can say is that with all the money this company has gotten from its founders and early access they have done nothing with it.
13540	This game would be great if it was being released 15 years ago but as you have to buy the game for a lot and get something that most people wouldn't think about charging you for then ask you to pay for more for in game items THEN say it's not early accese so this is what your going to get, not what we said we wanted to make but a sham of a cashgrab for those that will buy anything with Warhammer on it
13541	This is not a game I enjoy, even though I want to
13542	I wish I could recomend this game. However the developers pulled a scam here that even makes Overkill look reasonable. Half the promised content is missing and Items backers bought are still missing. And I dont talk abount 'Didn't get this fdancy sword!' but 'There aren't even bikes or heroes!'  Unless a miracle happens I realy recomend to avoid this like the plague.
13543	The Chaos Gods have done it again...  Let me prefix this review, I can't blame the devs, they have tried at least, but my overall impression is that they were rushed to release it.  I knew when I saw them announcing that the game was going to be finally launched that this was going to be a poor opening salvo, but I wasn't prepared by how much by...  I could really overlook the muddy graphics, character clipping, robotic animations, poor asset loading (Predator tank turrets a concurrent issue) but poor balancing in a competitive online shooter is a serious flaw...  Of the four races in the game, it seems that Eldar have the most unbalanced faction at launch, however thats not to say the Orks don't have a few weapons that seem completely broken.  You'll find playing matches against one of the races to be pretty much to be an uphill battle, as some weapons seem to one shot you from as much as a slightest touch (on your finger) and what makes this insta kill even more frustrating is the fact that you'll have no idea where the shot lands from.  Other areas that sent me over the edge were poor loading times - even running off an SSD and with 16gb of DDR4. Servers are lag tastic at regular peak times and off, games can from time to time take forever to load outside of 'Quick Match' and nothing really seems clear in terms of UI and controls (There was an Auto lock feature that drove me up the wall)  The price point is ridiculous at Â£39.99, I payed Â£34.99 the day before launch and even that was far too much, it doesn't feel like a triple A game yet the PP seems to reflect that it is, maybe the publishers want to wash their hands of this one and want to recoup as much money as possible.  I'm a massive Warhammer 40K fan and I have to say that again, I'd overlook the majority of these problems and price, but not the balancing, particularily as I only really want to play Space Marines (Dark Angels) I hope that the devs can craft this game into something that we as fans can stand beside, but right now I can't say I'm enthused by this release.  Avoid for now, but maybe keep an eye on it...
13544	Overambitious, undercooked and thrown from it's mother's womb far too soon. Whether to blame the devs or blame the publisher, I don't know. Each are copping wrath for what this game currently is.  Personally I couldn't recommend it right now. I enjoy it, but I also enjoyed alien colonial marines. How? It's how and who I play with in the game despite how much of a mess the game is.  Come back in a year once it's had more of it's development lifecycle.  Also absolutely â¥â¥â¥â¥ you Behaviour Interactive and/or BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment, Behaviour Digital, for the digusting in game microtransactions for aesthetics.  Disgusting.
13545	Was fun a month or two ago, orkz actually could melee fight â¥â¥â¥â¥ an plasma cannon still â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥... now its nerfed, plasma cannon can shoot twice before one melee swing pretty much, one shot kill with that â¥â¥â¥â¥ make's sense right?  make sense they favor space marines over other faction's cannot even play with my loadouts anymore an there rank 5 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing orkz whatever guys done waiting around for fair game's. yall remind me of every RTS progression. just nerf everything except the dev's favirote's. Why rts died.  why your game will to good â¥â¥â¥â¥ing luck ill be unistalling now god you guy's â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up.
13546	Game is poorly optimized, waait for the developers to give up and make it F2P
13547	Game is poorly optimized, waait for the developers to give up and make it F2P
13548	Not enough players in the queue to start a game, getting a refund.
13549	The controls are clunky, the networking is atrocious, and balance is a joke. I desperately wanted to enjoy it, as I'm a huge fan of the Warhammer license and loved Space Marine, but this fails to deliver any kind of meaningful or pleasurable experience on almost all fronts. If you're a fan of glitching around and spamming a melee button, this might be for you. If you enjoy employing any degree of actual skill or tactical gameplay, steer clear.  But worst of all, the game is not what was advertised. I expected a massively multiplayer persistent shooter, and it's just a large-scale lobby-based shooter. That by itself would be bearable, but there's barely anyone playing so after giving up on a co-op queue time of about 10 minutes, I got into a game with way fewer players than advertised that was over in less time than I waited to get in. Completely overpriced at $50 and I would much rather spend that money on something else on Steam.  The only possible upside is that I was given my first experience with Steam's refund process, so that was beneficial, I guess.
13550	Being an early supporter with one of the founder packs, I am vastly disappointed that in the end, they decided to just 'give up' and just release the game as is; barely providing anything promised.  I have finally learnt my lesson (along with those who bought No Man's Sky) to just not pre-order from small developers or maybe just not pre-order at all. Developers just get away with it too often without being transparent.  TRANSPARENCY is the key people.
13551	- 'Warhammer 40k Space Marine was better' - 'So...?' -'Well, Space marine came out 2011' -'oh....' -'It had a single player, PvP multiplayer and a PvE Escalation mode' -'And this game doesn't?' -'Nope... Just a Multiplayer' -'Is it any good then?' -'Nope.'  I could go on and on. Today is their launchday. When I click on 'Store' for Space Marine, half the items have a description, half of them just show 'text'. A placeholder. On launchday. This sums it up perfectly. (check it yourselves, the helmets of space marines for example).  The markers above everything (players/objectives) shutter when you look around with the mouse. The guns in the vehicles lag the crosshairs behind your aim (severely!)  Here's the sad thing: Warhammer Space Marine got me started in the whole W40k franchise. ESPECIALLY the PvP Multiplayer. And this game takes the portion I love so much form the old game, and focuses on it. And man, they got it SO WRONG.... I really can say the game from 2011 blows this right out the water.  Just another Assasins-Creed-Unity-arkham-knight-whatsoever-broken-launch.....  And let me tell you right now: This isn't any star citizen ambitious high end-game that just needs some polish! This is a very basic boots on the ground 3rd person shooter, where you mostly have to cap 3 onjectives, with some simple vehicles added for mobility. What I'm saying is: This could have (and has been) done YEARS ago, there's nothing revolutionary new or different or fancy to other games. And STILL, they MESSED IT UP BIGTIME...  If they had invested another 6 months, this game could have been ok. And the community DID TELL THEM TO DO SO (Check the discussions. By the time you read this review you might have to scroll back a bit). Still, they insisted to launch, and man, it's gonna fail.  Here's my prediction: This game ONLY offers a multiplayer. So it lives and dies with the community. Okay, so a hell of a broken launch like this one drives away most of the backers pretty quickly. By the time this gets fixed, the community will have died off. Why? Lotta triple A shooters coming soon, it's September now. ;)  Then, in like 3-4 Months, some will come back, either to see it unfixed, still, or to find a dead community.  I love warhammer, even their chessgame (Called warhammer regicide on steam) but I have to say, at the games current state, save your money. Seriously. This is a NO BUY.  Oh and btw. there's an ingame store to buy items for your character with real money. Your 50 bucks just gets you a base-game license. You can spend more money inside the game. Way more money. And for the price of an 'epic gun' you can buy 2-3 indie titles right here on steam, at full price.  Just.... don't. That's what I'm trying to say.
13552	clunky, looks unfinished, poorly designed
13553	I cannot recommend this game in good faith. I was excited by the prospect of it and think there are some good bones underneat all of the issues.  But in the short time I was playing, I must have had 10+ crashes to my desktop, multiple instances of the game freezing or lagging in matches, and the mouse/camera becoming unresponsive ....which is fairly important to shooting your enemies and navigating terrain. The Graphics are passable. The game play would be fun if not for all of the problems I encountered.  Maybe if they do an amazing update or overhaul I'll consider repurchasing, but this left an awful taste in my mouth even at the sale price I grabbed it on.
13554	This is not an MMO and it will never be,it's a simple lobby shooter with bad FPS and glitches and bugs to go with it.
13555	I don't normally post reviews, but holy â¥â¥â¥â¥, this game.   I don't mean 'holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game' in a good way either. I mean it in the way where you think you're gonna score with a super hot chick, but it turns out it's' not a hot chick, it's actually a robot designed to kick you in the testicles multiple times.  'Rabbit, why would you walk up to a robot clearly designed to crush your cojones' You ask.  The thing is, it wasn't supposed to be a ball beating robot. It was supposed to be a hot chick. I mean, I was told it would be a hot chick with all the trimmings I would enjoy, but it turns out, over time, it becomes an automaton designed to slap my scrotum, and I'm not into gonad grief, but apparently the the developers that made this robot think I am. While this is going on, the creators of said robot are flinging insults your way.  In order to protect further, genitalia, I'm gonna warn people off of this robot, I mean game.  -Devs seem to highly favor one faction -Devs unprofessional and insult community -Due to favoritism game is very unbalanced -Bad latency problems -Poor balancing in general. They tend to hit things with a meteor rather than adjust with a scalpel -Can't actually play with large guilds unless you add everyone to your friends list, one person leaving/crashing requires everyone to leave and be reinvited  tldr; Game had potential, but got â¥â¥â¥â¥ on.
13556	Not what was promised.
13557	This game is clunky. Like really clunky. It does not explain itself well, the mechanics are rough and you will get farmed. Expect to die 20 times before you make your first lucky kill. There are technical problems and balance problems Currently, this game seems to be VERY inaccessible for new players. It is bloody difficult. I'd think you'd need to stick a large amount of being farmed into this game to be even able to compete.  For now at least, DO NOT BUY. Seriously. You will most likely regret it.  
13558	4:3 monitor support removed. Great... Got a refund thought
13559	This game does not support native resolution of my monitor (1280x1024). It has only 1280x720 and 1280x800 options. And it can not properly scale. So it is pretty much unplayable for me. This issue was in early alpha and is still here. Asked tech.support for help 3 weeks ago and did not received any answer.
13560	It's OK - a lot of competing positives and negatives...   The major problems right now are clunky performance (even with GTX 1060/3 GB) and a lack of players...   Good interpretation of the universe and very heavy visually, lot of nice details, but the core gameplay is (most of the time) not very smooth or responsive. Like you will simply left-click to fire a basic bolter and... wait.... and then the weapon fires. Which of course means you're dead now. =/   Sometimes it works fine - sometimes it doesn't... and that inconsistency in the actual game play is what's VERY VERY frustrating...  It seems like maybe in the rush to make everything look good, they forgot to make everything WORK good... so essentially it's a very nice-looking Corvette with a 3-cylinder Geo Metro engine in it...  Steam Charts tells the story:  http://steamcharts.com/app/375230   Rarely more than 300 players on at any time now... from October to now (Mid-November) average player numbers are down about 41%. Sad to say, it looks like it's dying rather quickly. Lot of promise here too - I hope the devs can save it but it won't happen if the game isn't consistently playable.   â¥â¥â¥-backwards development priorities me thinks... reverse that and worry about playability first and then we'll see...  
13561	Look how all the awards says stuff like 'most anticipated', and 'best beta', the game is marked as being released, but it still feels like a beta, and it is not the game I was promised when I bought a founders pack. I wish I could recomend it because the potential is there, and the ideas the talked about before it was released were really good, but the actual product is not, atleast not yet. Hold on to your money and hope that they fix it before you buy it.
13562	WH40K ETERNAL CRUSADE Personal Verdict 4.5/10 The game is acceptable but NOT WORTH 50$   Personally love this game. Great Potential with Epic scale battlefields.  However, I sense the Extarminatus descending upon this game by developers in shadow and money-hungry publisher. When dat day comes, I shall know .. fear.  Pros- 1.Unique 4 factions and characteristics  LSM- Spess Mehereneee! CSM- 4 chaos gods psykic abilities  Eldar- Male and Female, Psyker abilities Orkz -Waaargh morale boost.  2.Great maps and wh40k structure designs.  3.Unique WH40K weapons and Vehicles.  4.Unique melee combat mechanics.   5.Various customization.   Cons- 1.Overpriced ( not really worth 50$)  2.Unfinished game (Flat Pvp, Boring PVE) and Broken Promises  3.Massive Balance issues (THE BIGGEST PROBLEM)  PVP- Horribly balanced weapons and classes  PVE - ridiculous difficulty in horde mod.  4.. Developer's Lies continues. (Once again they broke their promises with latest patch. To Make Matters Worse, they did not admit their mistakes and faults from last twitch.   5.. Not so trustworthy senior producer. (just check what he have done to Dust 514 and defiance before he came to EC..... )  6. Bugs. (They are fixing thankfully)  7. Latency issue ( Getting WORSE.)  8. Lazy developers - The game suffering serious optimization issues. However, devs keeping their damn silence for 2weeks now Though its new year there are no annoucement about further update.     So Wait for 60%- 90% sale if you want to join temporary crusade before you get purged!  Feel free to leave comments.
13563	not enough graphics settings, badly optimised and gameplay is repetitive
13564	It's with a pretty heavy heart that I cannot recommend this game. I so badly wanted it to be good but $50 USD, with microtranactions for guns that are statistically better (even though the difference is minuscule, also you can modify the vanilla guns to be better), microtransactions for seemingly all cosmetic items, and of course actually having the gall to RAISE the price $10 after admitting they couldn't even make most of their development promises? Yeah, no, I feel a little disappointed that I can't at least get some oceanic servers so that the melee is at all usable for people outside of NA. Then again adding regional servers with that ABSOâ¥â¥â¥â¥IN'LUTELY INSANE PRICETAG would only serve to splinter the already dismally small playerbase.  The saddest thing to note here is that this game would have been completely acceptable if they just lowered the price of the game instead of bumping it up more and maybe kept it in beta for another few months, or better yet didn't upload it to steam when it was in extremely early alpha in the first place. In spite of what I've said the game is fun when it bloody works and recent updates have been really promising (y'know, when they work), but it only serves to salt the wounds because of how dead this potentially amazing game will be due to publisher greed in only a few months from now.  I'll change my review if anything miraculously changes but at the moment this is how it stands: For anyone who's a diehard fan and also has $50+ to splash around, well, soups on boys! For everyone else I guess just sit back with me and watch the (amusingly fitting) grim dark ending to what could have been a really damn neat game.
13565	I have been following the game from the start. My forum date is Oct 18, 2013 which is the first day you could have signed up for the forums. I've been watching it, I'm a founder and so on. Witness me in my rocking chair telling you about the ARG we had and never got anything for! I've been around. Simple as that.  Starting off, I'll throw out the obvious things that have come to pass. This game DID NOT have a beta. This game went from Closed Alpha to Launch in one day. And it feels like it. There are still bugs within the game from Closed Alpha. This is a warning flag for some people. This game reportedly has 70,000 (that's 4 zeros) owners according to steamspy. This game didn't reach 3000 players on launch. On a Friday. Right now, Saturday afternoon at 5:45 PM EST: 2,396 in game.   I cannot recommend this game. Unless you have a crippling neckbeard disease (like most 40k fans do.) that forces you to buy any game with the title 'Warhammer' in it. It is best you avoid this or at least wait to see what the future holds. Even then, it is uncertain. If you really wish, you could buy it now, refund it BEFORE 2 hours play time. Or keep. That's your prerogative. With that out of the way, on to the 'review'.  -If you are from a European or Oceanic country: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. You have NO servers. If you are from North America, you are 'generally' safe. The servers are in Canada I believe. Surely, this isn't a problem for us Americans and Canadians! Two words: Region Lock. There isn't any lol. You will play with warping, laggy people from around the globe.   -If you want an MMORPG: Eh. This game is not an MMO. It's a lobby shooter. You get on, make a character, click battle now. You get put into a 30v30 game. If you're lucky you get to play a Fortress map which has slightly more players. The 'RPG' elements is a progression tree. Or a progression cluster â¥â¥â¥â¥ really. The advancement tree is not pretty on the eyes but there is a lot there at least. If you want an RPG experience, this is not it. There is no world. There is no life. It's a lobby shooter with an advancement tree tacked on. That is apparently 'RPG' worthy. (*hikes up his DnD suspenders. Grumbles about 4th Edition.*)   -If you were expecting a battle map. I mean...uhh. So when the Open Worldâ¢ was put on hold 'indefinitely', they said we'll have a battle map. A world map that you could engage and go to the fight with! What did you get? You got a battle map yeah...that is nothing more than a color changing picture. You have no interaction with the map. You don't click the map and fight here (like Heroes and Generals, which I think everyone thought it was going to be like). The map, is literally nothing. That's that.   -If you dislike microtransaction: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. This is a 50 dollar game that has a cash shop. While mostly cosmetics and offering a few grind bypasses for some weapons that become inferior after a few mod unlocks, it is benign. BUT remember: The road to hell is paved with good intentions. Only time will tell how far it goes. Will they keep their cosmetic only promise? That is the future we don't know. They promised since Day 1 there will be no P2W. So who knows.   -If you want to look cool: Pay money to look cool...more than others. Seriously, why? What was so wrong about the Space Marine cosmetic system of being unlocked via achievements? The problem is the pricing. Here, the cosmetic prices are WOEFULLY unbalanced. An Eldar Helmet is nothing but the default skin with a different color. You spend 10,000 RTC (about 11 USD. You have to spend 15 bucks at minimum to get enough RTC points because the rates are DUMB AS â¥â¥â¥â¥ AND UNEVEN.) for one helmet...you can't use on other classes. Meanwhile, for 10,000 RTC, I could kit out a Space Marine in some swag that he can use on ALL his classes.   -If you dislike RNG progression: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. There are things called 'supply drops' aka loot boxes. You buy these boxes with the ingame currency you get after a battle. They range from 1000 (usually 1 game's worth) to 30,000 (have fun). And! It's ALL RNG! These boxes have 2 things: â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ reskins and weapon modifications. You will have to play the RNG box to get your weapon mods to get the maximum effect out of your weapon. A 30k box could drop you a random modification for a gun you don't want. Fun huh!? If you think this belongs in a F2P game? You'd be right. (Foreshadowing?)  -If you want a PvE/Co-Op game: DO NOT! BUY! THIS GAME! The PvE/Co-Op content was always slated as a very minor part of this game. PvE has been unplugged numerous times in Closed Alpha. It has been terminal for awhile now. Right now at launch, there is zero incentive to play it. With the â¥â¥â¥â¥ poor XP gain being capped at 1000 and the game breaking bugs (no pun intended) that have been in for MONTHS, it's not worth it at all. And I have no clue when it will be. If you want PvE/Co-op, go with Deathwing instead. Or play Space Marine's PvE/Co-Op and cry yourself to sleep wishing this game had that. MAYBE by the time Deathwing comes out, this game's PvE will be good...but I won't be holding my breath. Avoid this game for the PvE/Co-Op content.   -If you want a pure shooter experience: Uhh. What are you? Stupid? This is 40k, you'll always have some roided up meth head looking to hit you with something. Your shooting experience will be dictated by a melee class. When that melee class decided he wants to fight you, you better get ready to fight back in melee. OR get lucky and gun him down before he does that. I suggest you 'learn' the system. If you can even learn it still. The 'rock paper scissors' system they talked about seems to be more like coconut, handjob and tactical nuke. The melee has gone to â¥â¥â¥â¥ ever since launch, sadly. OH and enjoy melee classes warping around and one-shot'ing you. Enjoy Ivan or Hans being about 20 feet away from you one second and you being dead the next. The game doesn't need hacks if you're not from NA, you come with them pre-installed.   -AS MENTIONED ABOVE: No region lock. EVERYONE connects to NA, specifically Canada. You will have people warping around ,stabbing you as if their ancestors had empowered them with magic.   -Balance. There is none. Eldar will always be OP to everyone. Even Eldar! (People have been openly boycotting Eldar games as they leave queue whenever they get a game against them). Everything is OP to someone in this game. Gun Turrets/Quad Guns are the ultimate cheese that one shot infantry. In a game with limited AT at the start, you will fall prey to this thing if someone hasn't already destroyed them within the first few minutes due to the major threat they pose. Heavy Bolters have been the king of the battlefield for months and still somewhat are. You will be facing a CSM/LSM team with probably 60% of them being Havocs/Devastators using a Heavy Bolter. Or Autocannon for CSM. The list goes on.   I could go on about optimization, netcode and so on but I won't. I've talked about enough.   TL;DR: It's fun in short bursts, not worth the 50 dollar price tag. You can pass it up if you're not a hardcore 40k nerd. OR you could just try it for less than 2 hours and then refund or keep it. Do not bother if you're not in North America.  PS:  http://i.imgur.com/76Ud1jE.png  What a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing stupid price scale.  PSS: Some dumbass over there thought it was a great idea to make it so you can't simply step over things. What's that? A waist high surface? A shin high piece of pipe? NOPE! Can't get over it. I've been stuck in so many places where even in real life a toddler could get over. This results you in having to kill yourself.  PSSS: This game has stats. What does that mean? No one â¥â¥â¥â¥ing knows because they never bothered to tell us what the stats mean. There's no list of stats. There's no tooltip to tell you what the stat does. You have to guess. Armor? Toughness? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? NO ONE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING KNOWS!
13566	Lots of bugs, clipping through the limited maps, Little visual customisation, Only 5 chapters, No Black Templars (A crusade you say?), Only 2 thirds of the basic weapons. Not open world, little progression, VERY laggy, get used to warping characters, Buying Early access gives you little extra atm ingame. Severely unbalanced. Orks and eldar have powerful weapons and the armour and strength of a space marine. Also the main game mode is arena based there is ZERO open world and is NOT a MMO. So role players look elsewhere.  It's a melee game. Where melee weapons suffer zero penalty for missing as the entire swing will hit and reach out. The melee weapons will kill in no more than two hits unless your using a defence weapon. A heavy bolter can land 15 hits on any enemy on not do anything, they will run up to you a swipe you once with a mace and your dead.  The game is a full broken promise.  Basicaly a copy of Space Marine but even worse game mechanics. They would of saved so much money by simply adding a couple of maps to space marine.
13567	Keep the hell away from this giant cesspool of ineptitude. These devs need to stay designing Hello Kitty and stay the HELL away from anything resembling a warhammer game. That includes the modes. Holy crap at a pile of garbage that I cannot geet a refund from. 50Euro + Microtransactions AND 2.7k highest peak on launch? Gonna die within the year.
13568	Ooofâ¦what a waste of $50. I readily admit, I bought the game several months back while it was in Early Access. I bought into the hype of a Planetside 2 kind of Warhammer game. It sounded amazing. Now I know, youâll admonish me for buying into yet another hype-fest in Early Access, and I readily accept such admonishment â but the game seemed to be moving in the direction promised and padding out the features promised at a steady pace.  Well, well, I was proven wrongâ¦again. Just a quick and dirty list of what was left out - No open world map to battle on (there is a world map but its function is laughably superficial), no MMO elements, very little customization, and lobby-based. Beyond that quick summary, I wonât bore you with remarks about what was promised or how the game compares to the Early Access version. Weâll just focus on this as if it were just bought as a finished product.   So, what is this game? Well, itâs a third person shooter set in the Warhammer universe. There are four races to choose from, and each race has a variation on the same set of 6 âclassesâ from what I saw. I did not play Orks, so I am unsure about their class variety, but Chaos Marines, Eldar, and Space Marines all had derivative classes â so I assume Orks had something similar with possible superficial variations. Now, to be honest, these arenât really classes - the only thing that changes (barring the Eldar Warlock class and its Space Marine, Chaos Marine derivatives) is the look of your character and the weapons you use. There really isnât much variety in the appearance between the classes, however â primarily just varying colors for 5/6 of the Eldar âclasses,â for example. The Store doesnât offer much respite from being just another clone, either, as the customization options are extraordinarily limited â a few shoulder options (roughly 4) and some helmet options that were recolors of the generic helmets (couldnât figure out how to change my equipped helmet, though).   This discussion of âclassesâ leads to another mechanic â the odd, out of place feeling, addition of some kind of basic skill tree. Upon level up the player attains attribute points to put into some garden variety, once again superficial, âskills.â Personally, it felt tacked on and utterly pointless. Thereâs no deep progression here, and not enough variety in the extremely basic skills to offer any kind of RPG-esque âbuild.â   Letâs move on to the THOUSANDS OF WEAPONS TO CHOOSE FROM! Oh..oh wait..there arenât thousandsâ¦there are, about, from what I can tell based on the in-game Store and loadout options..5-6â¦per raceâ¦Well, thatâs certainly underwhelming! To add insult to injury, the weapons donât feel like they have any impact behind them. Shooting doesnât feel satisfying, and aside from the flash of red when hit â thereâs really no feeling of being shot. In addition, while weâre talking about immersion, the screen excessively shaking and quaking whenever there are explosions nearby also disoriented me, and gave me a headache after a few moments. Moreover, melee combat isâ¦confusing. Mash the %!@% out of that right mouse button and hope you mash better than the masher on the other side of your weapon. Again, no sense of impact, no smug sense of victory at hacking down some peon who dared stand before you. Slapping the âexecutionâ button leads to a generic kill animation that lacks brutality and is laughable due to the stiffness of the player character in the moments afterward. Itâs all very bland.   How about we move on to graphics â ok? Ok. They look disturbingly plastic. I know that doesnât help much, but I really cannot think of another word to use. The models are weirdly shiny, with a sheen that matches that of, well, a plastic Warhammer model. Itâs immersion-breaking. In addition, the game runs poorly and is graphically underwhelming all around. The textures seemed blurry, from what I saw running around the environment frantically. Thatâs about all I have to say about graphics â to sum it up in four wordsâ¦Underwhelming and poorly optimized.  Audio â Well itâs there. The weapons have sounds. Thereâs no thunderous feeling to weapons that should feel powerful though, and no booming of vehicle weapons when youâre near them. I donât hear the rumble of tank treads, or the whooshing hover of Eldar tanks. Explosions sound muffled and are devoid of any impact. There are also random lines recited by the playerâs character, and laughably hollow taunts, but they donât have much point.   Battle Size - Battles, at their largest, are about 32 v 32. The game doesnât handle this well though. Expect framerate drops in the more hectic portions of combat.   Maps â Theyâre uninspired and lifeless. I donât feel like I am in a Warhammer universe. I feel like I am in a generic shooting game universe thatâs trying to capture some unspecified future aesthetic. I bought in to a Warhammer game, give me dark, gothic, unsettling maps. Give me something that makes the maps unique to Warhammerâs universe. Additionally, combat on these maps tends to be tedious. Itâs a game of whether one side can merely brute force its way through 1-2 choke points. I felt no unit cohesion, no semblance of encouragement to work with my teammates, either.   A quick summation of negatives and positives:  + Warhammer +Different Races (nothing unique about them aside from appearance though) + It works, and I didnât crash while playing  -Animations are floaty, and trying to vault over barriers is unbearably hit-or-miss -Weapons lack impact -Combat is boring -Executions don't feel brutal or gratifying -No sense of being an individual -Highly limited customization options(loadouts and player character) -Races donât feel unique -Audio is merely OK -Graphics are passable, no excuse for the abysmal optimization though -Lack of weapon variety - 30K points to spend in the Store for being a Founder are laughably pointless as all weapons cost about 10K each -Cut out a disgusting number of features that were initially promised both in posts and on the Steam Store page  Addendum: I wish I had not played over 2 hours, and had not bought the game months ago.  Taken from the store page:  'Choose your allegiances and background Pick between twenty different sub-factions, then earn hundreds of weapons and accessories drawn from 29 years of Warhammer 40,000 lore to craft your perfect warrior.'  What is this? Where is this? Where do I find it?
13569	It has admirable aspects and horrific ones.
13570	*EDIT/UPDATE*17/11/16  I've decided to uninstall Warhammer 40,000: Eternal Disapointment.   I've had it optimistically installed since the earliest alpha/beta waves as I was a Captain pack Founder. Every major patch or update has brought me back to dip my foot in the water to see how things are progessing, however I have now accepted that I am simply wasting my time and getting ever more frustrated in the process. This game will be pulled, or certainly be in the process of being pulled, in around 6 months time.  This game is a mere Shadow in the Warp of what it could have been. I've seen Space Hulks emerge from the Warp, infested with vile xenos and tainted by Chaos, that are prettier and make more sense than what they are offering here.  Screw this game. I want my Â£70 back. This is not what I bought into.
13571	I want to like this game so badly, but it's design is so off what a team FPS should focus on for fun and playability. The entire thing runs like a total war game but you're not the general you're the fodder on the map. I get the love of tabletop but this game having similar rules to it is just boring.  And friendly fire being on is at the top of the list. I get it. WH40k does have friendly fire, but again you are the general not the soldier. Why even play a melee focused class when the moment engage you in a fight you're dead to friendly fire. No one is going to stop shooting for a melee player. Just too many bad design choices, and I love 40K so them not nailing this irks me.   The PvE might as well not exist it is so shallow and pointless. I've seen holiday or event temporary PvE with better content.
13572	Poor netcode: This is a huge problem with this game, the netcode here is hit and miss most of the time, it was so bad at first I thought my internet connection was bad but no, my connection was at 100% and that's when I realised that the netcode doesn't work. What I mean is the netcode seems to have this dice roll to it where it decides what netcode you get because sometimes I log in and the game acts like a slide show to where I just quit and other times the netcode works and I can actually play the game. So if you like playing russian roulette with netcode, this game is for you.  Hit detection doesn't exist: This is a game breaking issue that's insane, it seems that you cannot hit someone half the time, I remember emptying a whole magazine of a combi-bolter at an enemy marine and only about five to ten of them hit(when in actuality half the magazine hit)... WTF! Melee combat also suffers from this, I remember an ork stormboy crashed infront of me swong his choppa and it was supposed to hit me but the game for some reason didn't register the hit, then I swing my force sword and hits him... yeah that seems real fair, NOT!(if you get the refrence then that's awesome :D )  Most firearms are worthless: Now remember that combi-bolter I mentioned earlier? It's in my opinion one of thee worst weapons in the game because it does f*ck all! What am I talking about exactly? What I mean is your lucky if you actually hit your target to begin with because the aim system is broken(and when you do hit you have to wait and hope the hit detection doesn't screw you), this said unless you use a weapon like melta or plasma weapons your risking not hitting your mark and even then those weapons don't seem to work at times aswell. Last I checked space marine and chaos marine power armor removes most of the recoil... nope! Your lucky if you can hit the broadside of a damn barn! This being said orks on the other hand are actually thee most accurate shooters in the game... *SCREAMS INTERNALLY* if you play orks you should have huge magazines but have aiming penalties because they can't hit jack. Eldar guns while not that accurate(which is correct lore wise) do an insane amount of damage to where they are overpowered as hell... this actually bring me to my next point.  These are not space marines or csm, these guys are panzies: Ah marines, the super soldiers of 40k, well they aren't here! These marines are guards men cosplaying as marines, to be blunt as a marine you die in two to four hits, are these suits made of paper? Marine power armor is known to take a massive pounding to smash through, with a power fist striking you it makes sense, when your hit by power/force weapons it makes sense... but when an ork with a slugga hits me and kills my chaos marine in four or five shots... it's bullsh*t because you never feel like a marine... EVER! It's window dressing, when your a marine your just as valnurable as everyone else instead of feeling like a super soldier like you actually freakin should.  No customization: Okay, let's look at this section and this is where you would think we could atleast have this... it would be great if that was the case, but there is no real customization. Litteraly everyone looks the same, no one really looks diferent besides a few changes... that you have to spend real world money to do(in addition to the $50 price tag when not on sale) Now if we used the in game currency this wouldn't b much of an issue, I mean I would like that because then I feel like I've earned my gear(you know like in Dawn of War) but sadly no, there's nothing like that... we there is but that bring me to my next point.  Skill trees are practically useless: Okay since they claim this is an 'open-world mmo' then we're going to get skill trees, but the skill tress don't do really anything, I'm going to use CSM as the example here, after unlocking the first bit of the tree(you get action points by playing games and then spending them on the tree) you get to where the marks are, now you may think you just have to unlock the traits you want, no you have to unlock everything in that part of the circle to then unlock the next thing you want, also the marks for Khorne and Slaanesh don't really do anything, they just do really small modifiers(like 0.5%) while the marks for Tzeentch and Nurgle add toughness, armor regan, things like that are way more useful. Oh and if you want warp-forged armor(and everyone who plays CSM does) you have to complete the first three circles before you can even earn enough to get it.  False promises: Now the claim is that this is an mmo that is world building, character building and an open world... I call bullsh*t because there is none of that here, it's just like four maps and there is no interacting other then killing other players. Also... where are the Tyranids, I don't know, it says they are here on the map but I've never seen one, not even a gaunt. I thought the idea was the Tyranids were invading this world while the four factions here were fighting over it, but like I said I have no idea where they are. From what I can tell this game was ment to be sort of like Galactic Conquest from the older Star Wars games with the Tyranids being common enemy, there's none of that here all this is is basically hard point from Call of Duty.  So all in all, this game is garbage, infact this is an alpha build because this game isn't even finished and yet it's $50 which is bullsh*t even when I picked it up for $20 it's not worth that this game should have been a free to play game in early access stating that it's alpha, this game fails as a game never mind being 40k game, it's a decent time waster if you have nothing to do for a couple hours but that's it. My advice please wait until this game is really finished, don't by this game because this game is not finished and it suffers from so many issues that this 'game' needs some serious help. Also, please fix the vehicles and turrets they are way too powerful and are virtually invincible.
13573	Poor netcode: This is a huge problem with this game, the netcode here is hit and miss most of the time, it was so bad at first I thought my internet connection was bad but no, my connection was at 100% and that's when I realised that the netcode doesn't work.

13574	Imagine the amazing game that was space marine WITH A MELEE SYSTEM; thats kinda terrible (literally slightly advanced rock paper scissors). everything about this is clunky and akward. The devs seems to still be chugging along, but with no major overhauls in sight, polish can only do so much to this hot mess.
13575	 Early Access Review
13576	 Early Access Review
13577	Okay so forget all the 'This game wasn't what it was suppose to be' or anything like that. I have now played several matches enough to realize that I can expect servers to crash, experience to be lost, bugs that ruin progress. This is outright Heresy! (Get it! ... Humor helps the pain). You can't make persistant characters, and then just LOSE the experience. I get near the end of a match, crash, no exp. Get near the end of a second match, we lose but all the exp goes to +00000. Fantastic. A game that you have to Grind your Grinding.  This game is not ready for release. It's not an MMO unless your consider 'You have a character that has ongoing experience an MMO (Which then CoD is an MMO). It's obviously a game they WANTED to make great, but likely were forced to release early. Expect a half imagined game being produced (Pretend EA or Activision made this)  Beyond that, the prices for everything with real money is just silly. Compared to a game like League of Legends (Who pretty much have pricing downish), You do not get NEARLY enough for what you pay for. Small changes to your model are not worth more then a dollar, when I already gave you $50 to start playing. I'd be willing to give you tons of money, but you've already failed to meet promises. Why would I risk spending more money on you.  This whole review is BEFORE even talking about balance issues with PvP. Read other review for the long run, but in short they really need to step up an applogize to the community for this release. Warhammer 40k is starting to rise in the world of video games, and I don't want it's chances of future games ruined by subpar games like this.  Again, VERY good potential for a game here, but I'd rather go back and play WH40k:Space Marines. I really wanted to love this game and play it with friends, but I can not recommend it to them or anyone else until they admit their flaws, and start making progress on this game.
13578	Payed 50$ for microtransactions and asthetic options behind a paywall.
13579	There's an infographic in at least one of the reviews that showcases what is currently in the game and advertised, and what we were being spoonfed up until then. I was one of the people that bought it before it's Steam Early Access debut. That was when the plan was to create an MMO.  What we have now is a fairly small scale third person shooter. It's clunky, awkward, and it feels like a bootleg version of the THQ Space Marine title. I honestly don't know why people don't go back to the multiplayer there, since the multiplayer interaction works, and so do the PvE game modes. Try the 'Nids game mode and find out for yourself.  2/10
13580	Very little of anything actually in the game and every bit of content they mention the next time they talk about it, its pushed to weeks, months, years back. ex: terminators and = were not at launch, then they say just after launch, then sometime in the fall, now they recently said it would be after the new year at an unknown time. The fact is these devs have no money, no skill, or both and they let you down and act like their open. After that they just throw balance tweaks everywhere and the game still cant hold up to large battles. All in all just avoid, I would say come back later but this game will be dead in months.
13581	This game should not be released. I wouldn't even have considered it Beta-worthy, given the promises that they made for initial release. Those promises were broken, and the 'game' that they released is nothing by comparison to what they offered. Given their supposedly see-though developing process, you'd think that we might have had some warning. That is not the case.  You might be able to still have some fun with this game, as it is technically a functioning shooter. Technically.  Do not trust these developers. They no longer deserve it.  I say this as someone who spent a lot of money based on their promise before it was on Steam in the first place.  I might check back on this game when they've done enough damage-control for their terrible decision but I expect absolutely nothing, and neither should anyone else.
13582	buggy boring and broken. Has a lot of potential in a few years, maybe...
13583	Really did not live up to what i thouhgt this game was going to be but can be fun untill you get killed by melee over an over again.
13584	This game's PvP is basically one map. Each side takes turns attacking and defending and that's it. There are no random maps (like figthing in a forest, on an ice planet), and there is no reason to level up except for gear. I don't think that there is any way that a newbie will be able to jump in and have a good experience. The experienced people will literally chop you up into pieces.The balancing issues are impossible to ignore, there are obvious problems everywhere ( like being unable to fire around some types of barriers and the shaky crosshairs thing), to bugs and glitches being rampant. I bought this game as soon as it launched because I figuered that the Alhastage would have fixed most of the issues but it didn't. This game is in no way ready for launch. I honestly don't see this game surviving longer that 180 days. I just don't....
13585	This was promised and anticipated to be an MMO-like experience. 49k did not deliver. This game is incomplete and not worth spending your money on.
13586	Really wanted to like this game. Developers said one thing while the eventually released game was something else. Dissapointed that I blindly followed a WH40K game again, back to space marine, at least I wont get fooled again.
13587	Not fixing performance problems or balance issues and instead put in overpriced cosmetics. Nah.
13588	First time - Crashed to desktop Second time - Disconnected from server Third time - Joined into a game played for 1 minute game ended Fourth time - Crased to Desktop again 5th time - Played for around 15 minutes then Crashed to Desktop  Game gets no more than 45 fps at all times I have a i7 5820k 3.3GHz Geforce 980ti 16GB RAM Windows 10  The game performs terrible... No game at this pricing with such poor performance should be allowed to be on steam.
13589	Eternal Crusade looks like a 40k game but its actually an overpriced cash grab bearing little resemblence to the canon. Poor balance, overpowered weapons, broken traits, and wonky vehicles destroy what could have been a nice followup to the excellent space marine. Games workshop should stop shopping its IP to third rate studios that can't do the source justice.   TLDR: I fired a heavy bolter into a charging enemy until it overheated. They didn't even falter and killed me in two melee attacks. Its not a fun game.
13590	Not fixing performance problems or balance issues and instead put in overpriced cosmetics. Nah.
13591	If you play anything besides a Howling Banshee, Emperor help you.  I simply cannot recommend this game. I really, really want to, but I can't. It's buggy, unfinished, lacks in content and has more balancing issues than marines have layers of plot armour (Which ironically they lack in here).  I'd jumped on the hype train when we were promised a massive open world of constant war a la Planetside 2, but watched from my Strike Cruiser in despair as the game was downscaled and downscaled and downscaled, into little more than an arena shooter an indie dev would have made a better job of. No offence to any indie devs reading.  Perhaps my biggest bug bear is the atrocious melee system. Allowing people to soar across the room faster than an Eldar can run in just a few swings. Melee classes are all the rage cos ranged classes, really the only strength marines have right now, are defenceless. They can't run, they can barely fight, and after a measley 2 seconds of clanging your blade against the other guy's power maul, you may as well drop your pants and bend over for the inevitable insertion. Even Orks, who are supposed to be the premiere CQC fighters of the current races, attacks are so slow as to be useless.  I turn on this game every once in a while, hoping one of the big updates, which to the developers' credit are frequent, will have fixed the issues myself and others are having... sadly, after a year of patches, a borked release and full price tag that includes little of what we were promised when we bought founders packs, we're still left wanting.  Go buy Battlefleet Gothic Armada or Space Hulk Deathwing instead.
13592	Well the game have launched and still runs like â¥â¥â¥â¥. FX 6300, Geforge 960 and 16 GB of ram and canÂ´t get the game to run at 30 FPS at mimimun specs.
13593	Badly optimised, full of bugs, clunky awkward controls, additional micro transactions, incomplete release. not worth the money.
13594	Atrocious. I'm a huge Warhammer 40,000 fan, having been a player and collector since the days of Space Crusade right through to present day and I, like many others, was looking forward to a game much alike to Space Marine, but with the larger scale larger scale, but the game is designed in such a way to make maps feel almost empty as you slog around. The weaponry and combat are both terrible and I prayed throughout the early-access days that the release version would be much improved on what I was seeing. It isn't.  In short, I regret buying this game. Learn from my mistakes.
13595	I am a great fan of the Warhammer 40k lore and games. But when develapors make a game to cash in on the dreams of players, and then in the end make a broken game that is unplayable after every damn update it is just wrong. When i played this game for the first time, there were some gliches etc but it was a fun game and i loved being a space marine. Then the updates started to happen in witch the *fixed* certain aspects of the game. And then they give you a 10k points because to thank you for you pattiens but things only got worse. The only thing that changed was they half way each match everybody loses connection and gets kicked out of the game. When you reconnect there are no more players because everybody lost there connection. And now i cant even play a game i payed 50 bloody euro's for. This issent a franchise in wich you can just get away with that, the communitie of warhammer fans is big but not as big as like the BF franchise. When BF makes mistakes it sucks but there are thousands upon thousands of players, so the game survives. If this doesnt change soon this game will destory it self and nobody would want to play it anymore. So as for this moment with pain in my hard i do not recommend this game. I would if it stayed with the small glitches but now i cant play the bloody game and its â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ me off.
13596	This is a horrible adaptation of 40k. .... you know what i cant even be arsed to list all the stuff that is wrong there is just so much. Buy space marine its better... and thats saying something.
13597	It has a good foundation of balance underneath the layers of utter â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. They released the game with netcode befitting a game of ten years prior, where enemies constantly teleport around the screen whenever they use half their mobility moves.  Weapons are linearly balanced, so when you first start, you'll get owned for a while. Basically, it's a gold cored piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥, and unless they do some serious cleaning, any new layers are going to just add more â¥â¥â¥â¥ and drive that potential amazing game further into obscurity.
13598	more features are to come and cant wait for this game to be finished.  if these 'positive' reviews don't put you off then you deserve this 'game'
13599	A poor excuse for a cash grab. Given time and funds with early access, yet now it's been launched with missing content and a promise of a better optimised and extended experience for the later (console) versions. Unless you are a huge fan of the 40k setting, then wait for some significant updates until wasting your money on this unpolished turd.  TL;DR Wait for updates or the console versions.
13600	Instead of telling your Kids that the Boogie Man will come and get them if they don't behave, get them this game.
13601	I normally dont write reviews for game, you either like em or ya dont.  With that said I really have to say that this game is garbage. The constant melee spam is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Melee is just way to overpowered vs anything else. The game seems amazingly unbalanced and after playing it for awhile its just frustrating.  Really really dont recommend this game for anyone.  
13602	Well the game have launched and still runs like â¥â¥â¥â¥. FX 6300, Geforge 960 and 16 GB of ram and canÂ´t get the game to run at 30 FPS at mimimun specs.
13603	Unfortunately half baked. Way too many bugs to be out of Early Access.
13604	The game is fun and i want to enjoy the game but with it current state i don't recommend it. I would say wait tell they figure some stuff out. So many glitches and bugs it pretty sad. They released early because of money and it shows. They also have lag problems and my ping is always 200 or more. They must not have any servers on west coast. After three week my ping gone from a average of 200 to 300. I get close to 30 ping in bf1
13605	This game is utter garbage much like the devs.....worst money ive ever spent hands down!
13606	I nominated this game for the 'Biggest Disappointment that wasn't No Mans Sky' award.  A shallow FPS, overshadowed by bigger and better games out there.   Try Titanfall 2, give this overpriced rubbish a miss.
13607	I wanted to like it, but it's just not fun. Not open world, only partial controller support. I can't believe I paid full price for this.
13608	Playing in Australia you learn online games always dissapoint. You still buy anyways hoping devs will support Oz gaming. You buy anyways because you're a hopeful fool who loves pain and dissapointment. You buy mostly because you're in denial about reality.  I'm going to play it anyways because somewhere along the way I broke myself, and this is all I can do to attempt to pick up the pieces.  internal struggle/10   Edit: MASSIVELY IMPORTANT EDIT: Improve your gameplay drastically.  go to: %appdata%   C:\Users\'Your_User_Name'\AppData\Local\EternalCrusade\Saved\Config\WindowsClient).  Once in windows client go to GameUserSettings  Switch your Resolution to lower specs with these settings: Change to: ResolutionSizeX=1024 ResolutionSizeY=768 LastUserConfirmedResolutionSizeX=1024 LastUserConfirmedResolutionSizeY=768  MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL: Resolution quality. Mess with this one a bit but only switch the first two numbers, yours' will be 100 to 90 to 80. Bring it down to 55.000000 or below, I set mine to 30 because I'm a rebel. It'll look ugly at first but play a game through FIRST, then adjust from there in 15s  sg.ResolutionQuality=30.000000   Edit 2:  sg.ResolutionQuality=40.000000 is still pretty and playable  After 44 hours of Space Marine play and a bit of Ork. I still cannot in good conscience reccomend this game.  Why?:   -It is pay to win, I finally gave in and went Chaos and payed for a stupid OP auto-cannon, because I suffered enough and deserved it as a self earned unlock. Some do this from the start, they give negative reviews and only play 20 hours max because they ruined the game for themselves. All DLC pay-to-wins lose online player base because reaching the end in the start ruins the whole experience.  -The launch promises were not fufilled AT ALL. Now, this didn't bother me so much when I started because i had no idea it was ofically launched. I thought because of all the bugs and lack of content that it was still early acess. This alone is a reason not to buy this game.  -Now this may seem stupid to you. But Ork fangs... Ork society is huge on it's fangs, status, strength, money. The base Ork in this game is a gummy infant without fangs... You have to PAY FOR FANGS! This is just foul. On this point you have to pay fo every cosmetic addition, another reason to straight up avoid this game.  Why do I still play: I love Warhammer. I own all the games, i owned table-top armies, I love the lore. If you are a huge Warhammer 40k fan yourself, and are not shaken by the $30-40 extra you'll need to pay for to make this a complete experience, dive in. But you have been warned.  Also don't play Eldar, currently they are so disgustingly OP only the 12yr olds go Eldar, so not only will you have to deal with never getting challenged by anything. You'll have to listen to a grade school chat room.
13609	The game is a unfinished piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥, with UNPLAYABLE 'balance'. Do not recomend, if the company ever fix the â¥â¥â¥â¥ broken balance i change my recomendation.
13610	All I can say is... I am sorry for not getting all the bugs out of this game when I alpha tested it. And When I told them going to the Unreal 4 Engine is a Bad idea when the previous engine allowed us to using Imperial Titans on a Massive Planetside 2 like map. I am SO SORRY!!!!
13611	  Let me start out by saying up front that I am a huge Warhammer 40k fan boy, and have played tabletop for about 20 years, and played every other Warhammer 40k video game ever made.  That being said, you would expect my feedback to be positive, however, THIS GAME IS TERRIBLE! I AM SO GLAD I DIDN'T WASTE MY MONEY ON THIS ABSOLUTE GARBAGE EXCUSE FOR A VIDEO GAME!  Aside from the fact that we were lied to about what this game was going to be. It is nothing at all like it was suppose to be! (It was suppose to basically be Planetside 3 - Warhammer 40k Edition.) My first experience with this game was a visual c++ runtime error, and after two days of updates, updates, and more updates, uninstalling visual c++ and reinstalling visual c++, uninstalling the game, and reinstalling the game, I finially managed to get it working. This is what happens when a company goes from pre-alpha, to release, without beta testing, or even F@#!ING ALPHA TESTING. This is what happens when a game company loses their lead developer, and hires scrubs to push it out so they can F#@! bittches and get money. (And you're the bittches if you buy this game)  Gameplay wise, I loaded the game, and right of the bat I'm gettting killed by one shot after one shot from pay-to-win tryhards who think being able to spend $10 to buy a power axe, and plasma pistol is good game design. It's like I'm living in a bizzaro world where bad game design is a good thing... Oh well, the game will be dead within a week. Uninstalling...  Don't waste your money on this garbage game.
13612	This game, is a simple lobby shooter with a 40k skin on it, nothing more.  I have been a huge 40k fan ever since I was a kid, I paint the minatures, I read the novels, This game made me feel like I was one of my minis. Running around, waging war in the 40k universe, but I could only take so much â¥â¥â¥â¥ from this game.  The gameplay if bad, really bad. There are tons of bugs and lag that makes the game unplayable at some points, this is simply one of the worse games I might have ever played. I even bought a founder pack three years ago for this game!  Back then it was supposed to be a massive online shooter with an interactive map and hundreds of weapon and armor pieces, there were so many promises and all was broken. If I could refund this game I would do it without hesitation so I can buy some of the new Deathwatcth minis.   This game also uses false advertisement wich is disgusting, the game costs WAY more than it's worth. on the Eternal Crusade forum they censore people that speaks out against the game and the devs, it even censores actual critical feedback that could be used to help the game to improve, It's shameful.  I will never trust bE again after this, and I will NEVER pre-order or join in a founder program for a game in development.  Lesson learned.
13613	This game isnt finished. At all.
13614	I chose to ignore the reviewers and didnt read them all, I instead went to a certain video streaming page and watched known players review and hype the game, it couldnt possibly be a lie becuase I watched them playing it so it had to be as good as I saw. unfortunately there is no mention of the mega truck load of microtransactions! I mean everything, if you want that good weapon-pay real money for it, there are some weapons avalable for in game currency but all customization is bought with a currency that is only avalable for real money and the price is absurd! Â£4 for 4000 RTC which isnt enough to customize your toon more than say a helmet or 2 and you can bet it won't afford your favourite torso armour!! You might have to spend Â£16(on top of Â£40 price tag) just to customize your toon if you were so inclined. I honestly do not know how dev's are getting away with advertising games as these guys are and not being called out for it(apart from by gamers but who cares what we say) for the most blatant fraudulent claims of a game. The players are not lying, this game offers none of what it says, that is the definition of mis sold goods!!!! As for the streamers...they have to be getting paid for their videos because they make no mention of the massive drops of content, the mind boggles! I saw a positive review saying the game has all of its stuff on the way including MMO aspect(wha?) persistent world, 1000's of weapons, etc, but NO that is irelevant it is not here now as promised and there is no media saying it is on the way(obviously because the adverts say it is here now, get it!?) It has been 3 days and they still havent emergancy fixed the balance of space marines being 1 shotted by any Eldar with any weapon be it shooty or melee, a Space Marine 1 shotted!? WTF bruh? I dont mind the 'clunky' fighting mechanics long range or melee but I can not stand massive inbalance, I tried to refund but did it too late so I'm playing cos I flippin spent money on it but would not miss it in the slightest. maybe they will patch it to the standard expected....you know like the division was..oh wait, nvm. Don't buy, GW and game devs in general need to stop rolling out unfinished rubbush.
13615	This game had such potential. Originally designed as a third person shooter/melee game played over a huge open area akin to Planetside 2 but of course in the wonderfully grim 40k universe.  My how times change. After some difficulties and changing program heads, the game was reimagined as nothing more than a dime a dozen lobby shooter with a 40k skin plastered on it. Of the original promises nearly everything was cut or postponed for an undetermined amount of time.  The races aren't balanced(and haven't been at any point in development), the game crashes, the maps are littered with reused assets, there arer NO remaining vestiges of the original MMO idea save for a training area where you'll see other members of your faction.  I can't even reccommend this game for 40k fanatics, it -looks- like 40k but at no point does it make you -feel- like a marine or an ork or an eldar. It's bland, uninspired garbage and not worth a purchase.  Oh and I forgot a small detail, brace yourselves; CASH SHOP IN A FULL PRICE GAME
13616	This game F&amp;%*ing sucks and basically... I want my money back. 3rd person shooter... PFFFFFT Yeah right!!! Sword mother F@$#ers all over the place â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Then oh boy I feel like i am actually doing okay this round... 'connection to server lost.' The graphics aren't pretty good they are not deserving of anyhting like pretty good. They are okay and super demanding of the most advanced GPU's for seemingly no reason. I couldn't figure out how to play... There is a short tutorial similar to dark souls where you walk around finding random signs to tell you how to play. Figuring out how to progress in this game was confusing too. The skill tree is short and super lame. All the weapons suck. If you dont have a good melee weapon you are screwed most times. This game was over-advertised and I bought into the hype. If you are a fan of shooters... dont waste your money. Especially when this P.O.S. is a whopping 50-60 bucks. And furthermore, I haven't regretted buying a game this much in a good long while.
13617	'the beige of video-games'  boring and uninspired. sadly it had so many good ideas and did not realise any of them.
13618	The latest statement from the person in charge of this game Nathan Richardsson  ''The largest MMOs in the world have less world persistence than we do''  Well in this game there is no world, there is no persistence, its not an MMO, its a basic team deathmatch arena shooter  Absolutely laughable that the developers are still trying to pass this off as an MMO when it really isnt.  If that weren't bad enough they released the game in a buggy mess, with most of the promised content not even in the game.....but dont worry they ''promise'' to add it at a later date. Yep how many times have devs promised this and it never happens  Also a cash shop in a 40 quid game?? Yep they did that as well. Bad enough they released the game in a sorry state, they still wanna milk you for more money to customise you character or even buy weapons  AVOID THIS GAME AT ALL COSTS!!
13619	 Early Access Review
13620	Uh... so.. I bought this game because I was told that it was going to be planetside 2 meets warhammer... uhh this is more like just Space Marine muiplayer with extra races. where are the dreadnought? or terminator armour? Both were suposed to be in the game at launch! uhh why do the space wolves have helms when it was said that they wouldnt and thats why they never made it to the alpha/beta... umm why did the legion of the damned and the attack bikes get taken off the store??? I smell something really fishy. I got this game in closed alpha for $19 and its worth that. But $49 is INSANE! They need to either add all the stuff to the game and make like they said it would with hundreds of people all on the same map fighting for land. or refund all the money that people are paying now. like I said its a good shoot for $19 but its not at all what they said the game was going to be. and that alone makes it a massive let down!
13621	I got behind this game when it was still being worked on. Loved the idea of a planetside like warhammer game as few games actually capture the scale of giant 40k wars. Instead what we got was a battlefield type game. Even then, it's barely that. There are about 4 or 5 maps with 2 objectives capture and hold, or just push forward. Races are seperated for lore reasons. So if you pick an Ork it's everyone else you'll be fighting. Chaos, Eldar, and Space marines. the biggest mode is a 50-60 person match, but for some reason it still feels small.   Another thing that was promised was an npc enemy that everyone has to fight. The Tyranids. Tyranids are perfect for this role as they are too op to be player controlled, and too numerous to stick to 20-30 man teams. BE haviour had plans to make the nids this massive invading force. What was delivered was 1 map that 5 people go through and clear. You just go from point to point holding off waves of tyranids. Very Destiny like. This mode could have been pretty cool. Even if you dont have a big open warzone like planetside, but after playing for a while i've noticed that between trying to avoid shooting your melee teamates whom just go in swinging widely at everything that moves, or other teammates whom feel that small unit tactics just arent their thing so they run waaaaaay ahead to achieve their dreams of becoming a corpse. It's not even close to what the original idea was. Very dissappointing, and kinda boring.  All of these things combined with an overpowered melee system, bugs, poor design decisions such as sticky auto cover, the lack of basic options, as well as the 50 dollar price tag make this out to be one serious let down. 3/10. If spacehulk: Deathwing turns out to be another let down I may just give up on 40k games for good.

13624	Buying this was a horrible mistake.
13625	 Early Access Review
13626	Test refund ability.  Success.
13627	Can't be bothered writing a proper review. They don't deserve it.  I followed development since Day 1. This game became a farce and a scam. That's really all you need to know.  Don't buy it.
13628	 Early Access Review

Want a persistent world shooter? Go play Planetside 2.  If you want a game that's a persistent world and Warhammer, look elsewhere. This game is just a mediocre arena shooter with a Warhammer paint job, complete with a territory map to show the 'persistent world' so that they aren't sued for false advertising.
13630	 Early Access Review
13631	 Early Access Review
13632	Seeing how its now officially released and the vast majority of content that was supposed to be in release are now 'Free content updates' i've got to give this game a big fat thumbs down. The worst is that there IS ONLY 8 FREAKING MAPS TO PLAY ON!! This game literally feels like Space Marine, except far more clunkier and laggier (They had 2 years to fix their performance issues and just barely made a scratch on them)  Weapon balance and factions is slightly mediocre. Vehicles are pretty useless until you get a devoted team to work with you, which happens almost never. Team cohesion is equivalent to a call of duty TDM full of lone wolves. Max player count is barely 50 players on 2 maps(with massive lag), the rest support 30-40 players. Character customization is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t honestly. 7.50$ for a freaking tiny helmet for your character? Why do they even cost money!? I've already bought this PAY TO PLAY game, it shouldn't act like its a Free to play with microtransactions.  The graphics in this game are so over the top, it mostly blinds the players in 5+ player fire fights. Try to play with the lowest settings if you're looking to actually see the enemy. The graphics in this game are so unneccessary. If you look at most of the objects in this game, such as environment meshes on the maps, they have so many useless polygons and details that arent removable with lower settings, it's literally sucking up the games performance to show unneccessary details that you'll almost never even bother to look at.  The PvE in this game is not worth mentioning, there's an xp cap of 1000 xp which is damned small in this games standards (Average PvP game generates 3000+). Only 5 player dungeons with 10-12 AI zerglings at any given time. It's not amazing or worth spending time playing it at all as there are no benefits or item unlocks.  I've got to give this game a 4/10 basing on the ton of problems its generating on itself, empty promises, and the curse of every warhammer MMO going to â¥â¥â¥â¥.  Just a heads up, this game is NOT and MMOshooter, Planetside 2 and Battleground: Europe are MMOShooters, this game is barebones Battlefield 40k with a max of 50 players (very laggy both FPS and ping wise).  Playing this game for well over 150 hours has made me hugely frustrated on how hard they dropped the ball on this game. Talk about dreams crushed into dust...
13633	I bought this game before the recent big changes of adding orks etc and bit more customization and I thought . Wow orks finally my favorite race to play. I love the direction the game is heading but .... It maybe just me and if so than fair enough but the gameplay is just far from fluent, its just a big pile of mess of people teleporting and swining melee weapons like crack heads on redbull and being hit from people you cannot even see. Seeing as I love playing the heavy weapons class the most, its pretty much impossible to hit or target anyone.  If it was less teleporty and glitchy I would love this game. Hopefully in time they will fix this.
13634	I'm not a tabletop player, I got this game as a casual fan of the setting and it does cater well to that. The gameplay itself is buggy and doesn't feel fluid with the weird netcode. Its also mired in weird design choices that, at a guess, come from tabletop rules but don't work well in an arena shooter. Balance is also an issue and I don't just mean the factions, there are maps where you can tell the outcome just by looking at its name.  All in all it can be pretty fun, but definitely wait for a more polished experience. Unless you can't live without the grimdark grim darkness of the future where there's only death (for you).
13635	i'm a founder and it's far from what was expected in the begining, a let down they prefered taking care of cash shop a instead of making the game better. cherry on the top the server are a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing joke invisible laggy ppl killing, unload full mag on ppl and still see them rush, kill you then die. EDIT:i was entitled to have 44k rtp(20k from founder buy + 20k from early acces deal that founder have acces to + 4k for referral).  so in the alpha i got only 20k so i contacted them and they said they couldn't do â¥â¥â¥â¥ until release. i said ok will wait whatever at thtat time there was nothing to shop anyway, so release happen i contact them again it's a bug they told me. i will get it when they fix it meanwhile they gave everybody 10k cause the game is a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥how, one month later still nothing. btw dead geam.
13636	I really want to like this game , cause I am a big WH40k fan, but the optimisation issues (at least for EU servers) are horrible. I have the game since release and since release they are not really good , I keep getting lag at medium settings (while my PC can run much , MUCH more graphically demanding games) and frame drops up to 2FPS at some points , making game really really unplayable. I really hope in future the devs will make the game great, but even after such a long time, It is a pain to play even though I really want to play.
13637	Worst 20â¬ I ever spent.  Could write at lenght about the game and its many flaws, but really this one isn't worth that, this isn't worth â¥â¥â¥â¥.  Laggy, buggy, unbalanced, crashes constantly, with horendeous microtransactions shop combined with atmoshpere that does nothing to invite the new palyers to the game. + Suposedly best description of the developers is 'charlatans that rival those of TV-Shop'.  Really after playing some 4-5 hours and only thing you feel is being just cannonfodder for the veteran players with superior weapons, durability and seemingly mobility (or it could be just pure lag as they do seem to warp around). At no level is this enjoyable game experience... then again some people might say it is, but there is as much wrong with those people and in their head as is in this game as a whole.  0/10 For clearly not even trying. Do not buy it, not even when its on sale and if it ever goes feetoplay don't touch it even then.
13638	Thurough disappointment, this game was announced as an MMO, not a lobby shooter, i am a very big fan of 40k and am very dissapointed that they didn't follow through with their actual plan 
13639	Game has no Australian servers.  Can't do anything with this amout of lag.
13640	This game made it fairly quick out of an alpha state to an closed beta state...and that's the point where the game is stucked up to today. Bugs, imbalance, op weapons, exploits and more bugs. The price tag is also ridiculous. Slapping a juicy 49,99 â¬ price tag on the game in this state and call it official release is just plain cash grab. There was also some false advertisement going on before release.  I really don't understand who made all those bad decisions. The dev team is really good and motivated, but it still does not justify this price. For now I just log in to get my daily dose of salt while trying to forget that I've founded this piece of disappointment with over 300 â¬...fml  TL;DR give this game another year or wait for a steam sale (at least 50% off) if you are a die-hard wh40k fan.  Update: I just nominated the game for 'The We Didn't Think Of Everything' Award ('BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT'). This is not because the game is not what it was supposed to be in the beginning, but for all the things I've wrote in this review + forum mods on the official forum that are whiteknighting all over the place, closing threads because someone could say something bad about the game at sometime.
13641	This game is fun as hell.  But don't let the 'Full release' fool you. This game is not finished, and is still to be considered early access. Animations are buggy, maps need fixing for things like getting stuck in rocks or not being able to walk up stairs, some weapons need reworking etc. etc. This game needs work.  As much fun as it has been for me so far, I cannot recommend it at its current price. There are some behind the scenes happenings that screwed up this release, so it's not really the devs' fault.  Wait until a series of bug patches has been announced past this date, and hopefully you'll get the game when it's in a more 'full' feeling state.  Lots of potential, and it's all being worked on. It's just too early for this game to be officially out, and it really shows in games and streams.  If you love warhammer 40k, you will most likely enjoy this game. Just not right now, unless you get it for like... 20 bucks off.  Anyways, good fun, but needs a lot of work.
13642	The game, For all it hype and promises, falls short from reaching..any goal really, other than being a warhammer 40k game ( Which is the only surviving horse it still rides on ). It was released incomplete and the company releasing it already are practicing some shady stuff with their purchased currency ( RTC refunds on launch are mostly issue of people that backed them up since when it first was possible, mind. )  Melee combat is bad, controls in general, clumsy and 'aiming' plain abysmal...with race/class balance being absolutely nonsensical in every lore and game mechanical way possible. Which suggests that creators of the game might not even care for what they are doing now that they are getting money in.   The game got some things good too: at times, visually surprisingly good description of wh40k world, even if in small patches, decent music and mediocre fun for a complete beginner with no clue of anything. And for a game of its time it has been surprisingly crash-free on release, which cannot be said by most other products of the gaming industry right now.  All in all, You are better off saving your money until the game is given away in some 70% off sale or something.  In a far far future where game might even be patched once or twice. With actual live testers involved.
13643	There is nothing to say. Other then its buggy, full of microtransactions that are way to costly, and not what was advertised. don't waste your money. I did learn something though. never buy into a game that hasn't released yet because it will most likely devolve into something else entirely. I wanted so badly to like this game. I even load it up sometimes to see if there is something redeaming about it in the patches...nothing redeaming just the same false hope. its sad really.
13644	Tried the Alpha, and the verdict: Cannot recommend this. Unplayably laggy. Waited until full launch, and the verdict: Cannot recommend this. Unplayably laggy.  Despite a lot of promise as a WH40k version of Battlefield, which I really wanted to like, it's just not fun in its current state.  I'll change my review if it gets fixed. It has potential.
13645	The game which was promised was not delivered. Ignore this game, bugs which are show stoppers are still here. They released as 'full finished' without even everything they sold online. I have an item I bought with RTP's that are still NOT in game. I sadly bought as a founder as such no refund is possible. Save money and buy something at least more then 25% complete as this game is. Empty promises and empty returns.
13646	Time to go back to borderlands, this isnÂ´t even an mmorpg, I hope they implement more rpg features in the future, but IÂ´m afraid that dream will never be fullfilled. It was so sad that people waited so long for a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing lobby shooter. RIP in â¥â¥â¥â¥
13647	As of right now, I cant recommend this game unless you are looking to buy it purely to support future development of the game.  Why?  Simple. The game feels VERY much like its an early beta, despite being released. If you are looking for a finished, polished, smooth performing game, then wait at least 6 months before buying this game.  Pros - Its Warhammer 40k - When its working without issues, its actually pretty fun  Cons - Performance is awful. Less than 30 fps on some maps with my gtx 1070 i7 system. CPU and GPU both no where near max load (usually no more than 40%). Sound will often start getting choppy after playing for a bit as well. - Bugs - Prepare to get stuck on invisible objects, warp up into the air for no reason, have your cross hairs have a life of their own, and all sorts of wonky control issues. - Very unbalanced. Melee is king right now, almost god mode in every situation except the pure, open outdoors (which this game doesnt have much of) - Texture resolution is super low. Washed out, blurry textures on most things in the game, even on ultra settings. This makes the game look like something from 2006, not 2016.  Personal Cons/Gripes - There is no option to disable BLOOM or Lens Flares, and they are SOOO over done in this game it burns your eyes. There are quite a few forum threads about this and the devs simply dont seem to care. They are common graphical options, for them not to add an checkbox to turn them off, is just a slap in the face to their customers. - There is no FoV slider. If you get motion sickness in games, think twice about this one. It doesnt appear to be set to the standard console setting of 60, but its no where near 90 (what most gamers use who get motion sickness) - No key to switch sides for the camera. You are always stuck looking over the right shoulder of your character. This includes most cases when you are hiding behind cover (ie: the supposed system is too wonky to be reliable letting you aim around the corner without your character moving and standing out in the open). Devs have stated its simply 'too much work' to add this feature.    Overall, the game just has too many issues right now that get in the way of actually having fun in the game. For every 30 minutes of play, you will be lucky to go 5 minutes without some sort of issue disrupting it.
13648	Worst 20â¬ I ever spent.  Could write at lenght about the game and its many flaws, but really this one isn't worth that, this isn't worth â¥â¥â¥â¥.

Do not buy it, not even when its on sale and if it ever goes feetoplay don't touch it even then.
13649	still early beta version :(
13650	Thereâs not much to say that it's just not a very good game and a far cry from what players were lead to believe it could and would be. Even at $20 I wouldn't recommend it as there are so many better options to spend not only your money, but also time on. This is very disappointing as I'm a big 40k fan and overall it's just unpolished, unpopulated, and not fun.
13651	 Early Access Review
13652	 Early Access Review
13653	In my mind this is still Early Access. Its an unfinished game. Not what was promised and buggy as hell. Better to wait until they complete the game to buy.
13654	Count me in with all the other reviews of the people who were promised more. I was one of those idiots that spent $240 on a game because of the level of game play I was promised. I love the warhammer universe and thought this was the one. My review is simple: I dont' have many hours because I don't like PVP capture the point games much. As you can tell from my hours played it isn't extensive. This game is terrible and the developers should be ashamed of themselves for taking so much money and giving nothing in return but a $30 game. This is probably worth a humble bundle $6 for with 7 other titles but nothing more than that. The graphics are fine, but thats about the only thing I don't hate about this game.   Hey developers, give me my $240 back and I will feel better about this game.
13655	I can not add much beyond what has already been stated in these reviews. I can add that I thought gaming was supposed to be fun. I can not play a game where I get angry. I can not do it. Now, I grant that maybe I am just not good at this game. I grant maybe I am not doing the right 'build' or something. But any game where you spend more time respawning than playing is a bad game. I can not understand how I can shoot a veteran player 60 times and have that player still kill me in one hit. I do not understand why the devs would think that would be fun for anyone.   Not to mention the hourly server crashes and lag.   In summation, all the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ing about balance, the obvious bugs and technical issues, bad vehicle mechanics and being ouright lied to about what we were getting for $50 aside, if I had fun and felt challenged playing this game I would not have given it a thumbs downs.   Also, you f**king devs owe me a for a new keyboard I broke raging over your sh*tty game.  Add on: I would also like to note that it seems that if have a bad internet connection or a slow one, you will not do w
13656	golly gee I wonder when this game is launching
13657	simply un-fun to me personally. I enjoyed the general feel and play style of the older space marine so I think i'll stick with that one. all based on personal opinion though, others may still get some enjoyment out of it.  that said, i'd suggest buying it through steam so you can use the 2 hour trial period and getting a refund if you end up disliking it.
13658	As it is right now, I just can't recommend this game. Give it half a year to a year and see if it's improved by then, or if you really want it wait until it's on discount. It's just not complete.
13659	I want to, I really do, but I just can't recommend this game in its current state. I love 40k, I love that you can play as Eldar or Ork in a shooter game, I love the little lore-friendly details that the devs put in with the subfactions, I like the visuals and sound design, and I am even ok with the game not being the '40k-themed Planetside 2 with 4 factions AND tyranid AI' it was advertised to be because let's be honest, I never believed one second that would ever happen and I only spent 30 bucks into the basic founder pack.  But the thing is, even as a basic lobby shooter with character progression/customization, this game is bad. The performance is down the drain, the sound gets choppy, the balance is out of the window, the store and customization options are both underwhelming AND pricey especially for a full-priced B2P game, and the gameplay... the gameplay is the most atrociously clunky and buggy glitchfest of dumb â¥â¥â¥â¥ I've ever had the displeasure of getting my hands on. Everything from basic movement inertia, to aiming and auto-cover, bullet spread, vehicle physics and of course the netcode, is horrible. Even the party system and the matchmaking are clunky and badly made.  Even though, I still managed to have some fun in the game. It was more due to the awesome setting, the presence of friends and often at the expense of the game, but I had fun nonetheless. If you do buy it for 50 bucks now, don't expect a release, even less a AAA game. It's a clunky indie game in beta that shows promise but is completely unfinished and unpolished, and you're spending money on pure faith in the devs to fix their sh*t. They honestly seem like nice guys, but it's going to take more than nice guys to make this playable in the long course.
13660	The game is mixed. I really want to be able to recomend it to you, but i can't in its current state. What we have is significantly less than what was promised when i originally backed the game. and even significantly less than what bE promised when they redesigned their development templete later on. Could this game be great, Yes. Is this game worth the current $50 price tag, No. I'm going to keep my eye on the game i already have it, if they keep their promises of continual updates after the release then perhaps it will eventually be the game the founders payed for, till then... keep it under your hat.
13661	Alot of people love this game for what it could be.   Alot of people hate this game for not being what it was promised to be.   Personally? I'd be happy with just a good Warhammer Lobby Shooter. Even a middling Lobby Shooter with a 40k skin (though certainly not at the current price).   But this game fails at being even that. It's a slog of unbalanced classes, factions, and weapons that culminates in a chaotic mess of a product. Sometimes that chaos briefly coalesces into an enjoyable style of mayhem, but more often than not - and with more regularity as you play â it's just a frustrating mess. It'd take more than a few weeks or perhaps even months of polishing what is already here to fix this game let alone expect new content of decent quality.  As a fan, its heart breaking to think how good this game could be, that it SHOULD be after all this time in development. As a customer, I can only wish there was something more in here so it wouldn't sit in the dark crevices of my Steam Library, but Eternal Crusade isn't worth your money, your time, or your hope.
13662	This is basically a scam. Littered with microtransactions. To be promised an MMO of the 40k Universe, just to play planetside skinned with space marines. PvP Balancing is crap, the movement is crap. I WAITED A YEAR TO PLAY A GAME THAT IS WORSE NOW, THAN IT WAS IN PRE-ALPHA. AVOID AVOID AVOID

13664	Releasing this game at the current state is an insult to the original founders. Maybe the publisher just pushed the release and thus the features were cut. You die in a matter of seconds, the weapon handling is strange, server perfomance is terrible at times and if I thought that the Space Marine Multiplayer was perfect and fun, I would have played that and not this game. At the moment it is just that: Space Marine Multiplayer with a couple of tanks.   This is a foundation of something great but not at the moment.
13665	Not what I expected. Bad camera angles, poor optimisation. Don't buy yet. Maybe 1-2 years.
13666	'To withdraw in disgust is not apathy.'  -Last recorded words of Sgt. Valarn, Ultramarines 5th company prior to being vigorously ploughed by an Eldar wave serpent, blasted by a heretical plasma cannon, stunned and stabbed repeatedly by an ork choppa, shredded by an indecent number of autocannons, incinerated by a fire dragon wielding an oversized hairdryer, blasted by a loyalist plasma cannon, and who was then teabagged to the brink of death before summary execution for incompetence not more than several seconds after respawning. 
13667	Altho devs added alot of good content, weapon selection is good, i cannot enjoy this game, for on my pc, that runs 80% of the modern games on high settings in 30-50 fps, i cannot get over 20 fps on high, with 40 fps on potato settings. And the fps drops are constant, mouse controls feel wrong and sluggish, not allowing any twitch aim reaction. Combined with fps drops, it makes targetting in close range combat impossible. Hell, quite often in long aswell...Oh, and mouse aiming feels horribly sluggish-i know ive said it once, but its THAT bad...
13668	I just don't get this game at all. No idea why Games Workshop waste so much time and effort on producing games like this. When I first heard about it , it sounded amazing, a world map where Imps, Chaos, Eldar and Orks fight for control. I guessed it would be something like Planetside. But this.... this is a heap of â¥â¥â¥â¥. Barely any players so the fights are empty and boring, the melee is god awful. IGN 10/10
13669	Any semblance of balance has been ruined. I used to like Eternal Crusade a lot. Now, not so much.
13670	I am a multi decade die hard 40k fan, by all accounts I should love this game.. but I don't. There is just too many issues with this game not the least of which is poor controls, I want to love it, perhaps after a couple of more years of patches they will get it there.. the store mode is a real bummer too.
13671	Note edited.  Original review: Jumped in during EA, - reason was 'MMOTPS of WH40K universe', instead got Lobby shooter(not even decent one to that). So my honest opinion: If i knew all that then(when i bought game during EA) - I would not bought this game. My advice is: do not buy, game doesn't worth it's price.  New review: Ok since there discount for game my advice is: you can buy this(with discount) only if you are die hard WH40k or Lobby shoter fan, depite shorcomings devs actually patching the game(atm) - direction is right but road still way too long.
13672	&gt;Join chaos &gt;Buy auto cannon / abbadons grace &gt;win game and all coming encounters  Not only that but this game runs horribly, the reticle is a mess. (try firing at anyone mounted on a railing and you will get it) Vehicles are a mess, seriously you sometime leave the turrets floating behind. I tried to give this game my time I pushed 3~4 hours into it hoping that it would be more fun for a new player once you can customize the class somewhat more. But I was completely wrong. I've tried to defend this game and I've wanted it for a long time, but seeing as even the balancing and gameplay is actual cancer I feel that is no longer the case.  Thank god this was a gift.  (And for the love of â¥â¥â¥â¥ing god, I don't care if the weapons are doing dmg according to the table top and lore. Tabletop strategy =//= an enjoyable 3rd person shooter.)  This game tried to be THQ's warhammer:40k space marine but fails misserably.
13673	So here we go.  I will go on many aspects of the game in a detailed review.  TL;DR FOR OTHER PEOPLE DON'T BUY THIS IT'S CRAP NOW, NOT EVEN SURE IT CAN GET BETTER.  Now for the otter more venerable player-base.  Foreword - The game had many lies told, and many dreams were crushed [R.I.P Planetside 2 open world gameplay, chance for tyranids to invade while you were combatting in PvP and other things :(((((.]  UI - The interface is quite fine, really. There's nothing wrong with that. They're missing a couple of things like player PING, or REGION, to make it easier for me to know against who am I playing OR knowing my ping. [They probably don't have servers for Europe based players]  Foreword Gameplay: The game started out fine, I got it around June it seemed promising. Now after watching a couple of YouTube videos I to my surprise I found that bE Devs are the biggest liars in history (among other devs *cough* No Man's â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ *cough*)   Section 1 Gameplay :   - Player versus Player - The shooting part is fine, the balance is horrible, the close combat is horrendous. They pushed the game to release not fixing bugs. I mean who cares what the 1000 people or so that were playing it in Early Access or Alpha, just go with what you care.  - The maps - for PvP are balanced but there is 1 or 2 maps which require improvement so that it's possible for the attackers to be actually able to progress, not sit in 1 point achieving nothing.  - Player Versus Everything/Tyranids - It's quite bland really. There's nothing to it. Standard players versus monsters with no interesting click to it.  Early access promises: Pre-purchasers would get this little interesting thing.  http://i.imgur.com/Jeu4p7C.jpg   And I still don't have it.  They keep promising free updates and those free updates will be the rest of the game content which was promised.  They seemed to change the 'About the game' section and added another picture.  If I could get a refund, I would.  TELL ME LIES TELL ME SWEET LITTLE LIES.
13674	Play Space Marine multiplayer instead, better
13675	Dont buy it!  Just â¥â¥â¥â¥. Its sad, but yes, thats all its â¥â¥â¥â¥.  Come back in a year or so.  Bad Things: -There is no MMO things at all -Its PAY TO PLAY/WIN. (Yes, much loved microtransactions). -The controls are a nightmare, the menu is broken and looks like made for Xbox (1!) -Its boring. Its your normal all day arena shooter. but badly made and lazy finishd. -Sounds are often broken and just badly placed and dosent fit to the animations. -The animations are lazy made. Often you just glide over the ground insted of walking. -No Offline/ dedicated Server Support   Good things: -Grafik looks good. (if you dont look to close) -well... it is a 40k game, and i love 40k. But hope is the first step on the road to disappointment.   Biggest Problem:  I have constant lags and screen freeze. And no, my conection is OK, not a single lag in all other games. But here im constantly cliping from freeze to freeze.  Im really disappointed. The promisd much and delivert not even half of it.  May the Emperor forgive them, i wont.   
13676	You'd think that a 'Battlefield with Warhammer' would be the best thing ever, but sadly it only looks and runs well. Once you start playing, you will be put off by things you haven't seen in a game for a while.  The melee fighting system is very clunky and the entire game seems to be heavily optimized to be played with a gamepad, instead a mouse and keyboard.  The maps are beautiful, but not very much thought went into the design, besides what anyone of us could do with a map Editor and some forethought. They have the basics down, but the polish isn't there at all. When you play official maps in games like Counter Strike or Team Fortress, you can see, how every angle of the map has been planned out meticulously.  The biggest disappointment are the tanks and magic. It's very dull to drive a tank, as no one ever mounts it and you wouldn't mount one of those, if it were driving right next to you with only one guy in it. The guns and turrets of tanks and fortress defenses have ridiculous range limitations and very little impact until someone with a melter comes along and ... melts your tank. At that point the tank is pretty much nothing more than a rolling death trap to the poor guy driving it alone.  The healing isn't fun, because your friends can and will be attacked while lying on the ground waiting for resuscitation. It's also a huge pain to aim the healing beam. If you play Overwatch or TF2 and are used to simply channeling your shield/heal onto your mates, you are not ready for this. (YOU ARE NOT PREPARED!)  I struggled with myself, whether to refund or wait and decided for the refund, as 50â¬ is clearly too much for this game.  It's actually sad to me, because it sparks with potential for greatness in every aspect of the game, but obviously falls extremely short, even of older games such as Battlefield Bad Company 2.  I'm sure a lot of people will have fun with this game in the future, but I'm not one of them and for 50â¬ it's definitely getting the thumbs down.
13677	I wanted to like this game, i tried i really did but jesus is it Pay to Win, Unbalaced Factions, going into a game with new players on your team and seasoned veterans on the oppisition, ive never even won a game yet, not only that its advertised as a Planetside type game but all it is, is an 3rd person arcade shooter with mediocre gunplay and stupid melee, that you que for matches for like any other FPS. theres only 2 types of vehicles A transport or a regular tank (no customisation, eldar grav tanks cant even 'fly' like in the artwork) No terminators or any type of elite unit, Veteran players will shred you due to not only experience but having the better gear... graphics are very meh same with the sound effects, phycics and collisions are terrible. so in the end this game in its current state feels like a Pre Pre alpha with years to go until a actual release but in reality its already out.
13678	No ultrawide support, choppy performance and random stutterings even on the lowest settings (I have a gtx 980ti). Gameplay feels clunky as hell To sum up this is an unfinished game with a lot of missing features....maybe in a few years they will iron out all the bugs...
13679	Horrible optimization. I've tried few things - changing priorities on task manager, editing .ini files, checking whether my drivers were updated, and so on. Game seems fun, it's just such a shame that it's unoptimized to all hell. GTX 970 and i5-4690k having issues like this, is unacceptable. Multiplayer mode would often freeze for good 3 - 5 seconds, resulting in a death or me standing dumbfounded for that duration, doing absolutely nothing. PvE mode, where you fight off hoard of tyranids? I couldn't even play that one properly, thanks to sub 1 - 5 fps performance. It looked fun. Oh well.  Have already put in a refund request, and the money is pending. All's well, at least Steam refund still works, right?  Though it is truly disappointing to have a game released out of Early Access and still perform poorly than, well, playable status. If they have kept it on Early Access, this would have been forgivable and I may have let it pass and give the game another go. But as it stands, halloween sale is approaching and I can spend that money more wisely. I may revisit this game once it has improved, but for me and at the time of this writing, I cannot recommend this game to anyone, thanks to performances alone. Game seemed good, played alright. It's just.. the performance was abominable. Horrid. Unthinkable. Even after attempting to fix the game, It still didn't play stably around 30 fps. I can't even give this a rating because I haven't got to play it properly. Damn shame.
13680	The Imperial Inquisition has seemingly ordered exterminatus upon these servers. The gameplay has offended the God Emperor of Mankind and has made a mockery of the Adeptus Astarties. Tech-Preist of the Adeptus Mechanicus inform us that there is no technology in the imperium that can maintain a smooth and steady Vox Stream of the battles and thus victory is mere impossible. The sholars of the Adeptus MInistorum are currently in the process of aiding the Ordo Obscurus of the imperial inqusition in expongeing all hestory of this heresy from imperial records
13681	After reading the reviews, dropping my 200$ on it and actually getting into the game.  It's like planetside two had a mis-concieved love-child with Warframe.  Would be nice if Bandai didn't force them to release early, would also be nice if the devs, who spend much time on forums + discord from what I've seen, actually cared about the people who dropped bucketloads on the game.  I recommend no until they stop acting like we're all out to get them, or just grow up and realize people will challenge their ideals.  P.s. the way you portrayed the Melta is awful, as well as how much damage the bolter and main weapons of all species do. Seriously, eldar shouldn't be able to take 1 let alone 2 bolter hits without turning into a goo.

They keep promising free updates and those free updates will be the rest of the game content which was promised.  They seemed to change the 'About the game' section and added another picture.  If I could get a refund, I would.  TELL ME LIES TELL ME SWEET LITTLE LIES.
13688	This game feels like is at start of beta stage.   Horryble lag. Tons of bugs. Bad and i mean really bad balance. Most weapons and MODS!! for them are aquired by RNG â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t box. MM is non existant so you can go pubs vs full guild. No voice chat Oh and it has Cash shop. Dont buy at least not now.   Update: Major patch changed nothig major regarding balance (Melee and one hit wonders still dominate game), lag (its actualy worse), or cashshop prices. Buy Space Marine insted.  Update(1.1.17): If you are from europe avoid it. Its unplayable dou to lag.
13689	This is my review as of 9/26/2016. Don't buy this game. This is literally Space Marine 2011 without the single player campaign and with loads of bugs and clunky controls. Space Marine 2011 was awesome and I wish people would just go back to that for multiplayer.   In Enternal Crusade it's difficult to shoot people because there's lag and the bullet spread is wonky and damage is poorly balanced. you will have to unload a good 2 magazines of bolter rounds into one target before they go down. Imagine trying to kill a guy slicing you up with a chain sword while he is teleporting due to the lag. Good luck. If you want to try melee, have fun banging your swords together in this game's brilliant system of clashing swords. You will just stun lock each other forever until someone comes and shoots you.   Another brilliant design decision is to have friendly fire. Have fun killing just as many team mates as enemies thanks to the giant bulky space marine bodys crowding around eachother in the heat of combat. And to make things even more confusing, they put a red icon above the head of anyone in combat. Anyone. Friend or foe. You see that red icon? Its above your enemies head? And that other identical icon? Above the head of your team mate standing right next to him? Who thought this was a good idea? Stupid.  If you don't believe me read some of the other reviews. Don't do what I did. Don't buy this game hoping the negativity is misguided. This is a barely cobbled together alpha sold as a full priced $50 game. I got a refund. Stay away from this crap. Go watch a twitch stream if you want to see what I'm talking about. Developers need to learn that it's wrong to sell an incomplete product to customers while asking for full price.
13690	Im a huge 40K fan, I was so excited for this game and now Im extremley disappointed. Poor graphics and frame rate, classes are unbalanced (Favoring any melee over ranged). I hope this is not the finished product because it is not worth $50 at all.
13691	It's just not good. Poor balancing, bad execution of mechanics(melee). very repetitive maps launched half baked.
13692	games a little basic and repetative. is Ok at best and unoptimized PoS at worst. kinda fun to play despite all that but not at all worth more then $10
13693	Just don't, at least not yet. The store page is a flagrant lie. Half the stuff listed under the 'About This Game' is not even included yet. How this game got out of early access and shipped out like this is beyond me, and in my opinion is just a slap to the face of both WH40K fans and third person shooters alike. The game is buggy, poorly optimized, the customization is minimal at best, and the maps, for the most part, are rather uninspired and boring.   If you feel like buying a game whose store page is a big fat false advertisement then feel free to purchase this, otherwise just don't even bother giving this game a second glance until it's actually had all the features it was SUPPOSED to have added with it at launch. Just terrible.
13694	Honestly, if I could get my money back I would. They promised so much during the development of this game and kept so little, it's a shame they didn't ditch the Warhammer 40k license too.....
13695	Garbage game, Not what was pre-sold as. Steam also wont give refund for game time played in beta stages.
13696	A waste of the Warhammer 40k license. It's just a mess and I bet Games Workshop are kicking themselves at this solid gold turd that was thrown together. This tripe should be cast into the warp never to be seen again, seriously, wait for Deathwing and pray to the God Emperor of mankind it's better than this steaming pile of ork â¥â¥â¥â¥!  A $50/Â£40 aplha masquerading as a release title.
13697	This game is still using old control mechanics which are unacaptable in modren action games, melee is like game minigame - paper rock scisor, terrible weapon balance etc. etc. Im real fun of 40k universe and i realy appreciate your effort and enthusiasm but thats not enough... hope Deathwing will inspire you in some way
13698	Not a fan, really wish I didn't purchase.
13699	The game has a decent atmosphere but the balance of gameplay is extordinarily one sided for prem. weapons making pay to win your only option. Basically the game plays like an unoptimized planetside 2 remake with fewer players that you have to pay for. $50 is way to much. Save your money, wait for it to go on sale if you absolutly must play a 40k game
13700	I bought the captain pack as a founder because they implied the game was going to be a persistent open world mmo.  It is as much as persisten open world mmo as call of duty is.  Compete in various arenas for control over territory, however that is pointless as theres nothing gained or lossed.  Persistent? Well sure you can level up and collect new gear to equip but who cares, that's the same thing as the call of duty leveling mechanic, its nice to change things up but not necessary.  Open World? Hell no, its a MOBA TPS  WH40k Universe? Again not really, in what wh40k universe can a single orc take on a single space marine? right none. all races feel like they are the same with different skin, completely ruins the whole point of the game being a wh40k game.  Gameplay. Controls are clunky at best, movement feels forced and not always responsive the way you want to.  The maps all look to be the same drab colors with so little attention to detail i feel embarrassed for games workshop  i dont recommend this game, i regret buying into the hype and im sad i can't get a refund
13701	Bad game, avoid. No sense of direction from developers, bizarrely ugly models in many cases which can't be carried by the overdone visual filters. Only marginally improved since early days, little to no progress made in many areas. Extremely clumsy character customization with limited options. Not worth it even on sale - you will most likely struggle to draw enjoyment from this mess, spend your money elsewhere.
13702	Short version: Has potential and moments of fun, but it is a frustrating, hot mess of terribly bad core mechanics, some of the worst and most confusing user experience design I have seen in years, incomprehensible menus, little to no information given about your character, its purpose and how it compares to others. I've played little over 2 hours on this game, but I cant imagine that I will play any more, its painfully frustrating and just plain bad.   Long version: In between moments of frustrating confusion and disbelief, I can honestly see potential in this game, but right now, there are just too many stupid stupid stupid design decisions, some I fear are at the game's very core, that are getting in the way of me enjoying myself. Yes the servers are lagging, you sometimes get killed around corners and there are some pretty severe bugs still in the game, but stuff like that is likely to work itself out when things settle down, so I dont really care about that.  First of all the game explains nothing to you, nothing what so ever and it heavily limits your options to find out things about the classes you are playing. An example is the Eldar Warlock; He uses an ability called Jinx. I have no clue what it does, and I cant find any description of it anywhere in the game. The closest I've come is the custom loadouts you can make, where you can get a short description for an item, but seeing as (and I'm only guessing that this is the reason, because again, the game tells you nothing) im too low leveled to unlock Jinx for a custom loadout, it is nowhere to be found anywhere. So until I reach some unknown level with my Eldar character I will have no ingame way of ever figuring out what this ability does, cause in a match it feels like it does nothing. If it turns out that I'm wrong about this and it is shown in a menu somewhere, then where ever that menu may be, it is in no way obvious to a new user.  Once in a game the spawning system seems broken at times. If you choose to spawn on a point that is being fought over then you are likely to take plenty of damage from enemy fire before you are able to move. A huge problem seeing as those are the points where you are needed the most. The games basic movement feels good and the weapons feel satisfying to use, but when you start to interact with terrain you will run into trouble. Chest high walls in this games are absolute killers. Approaching two identical windows in chest hight, you are left with a 50/50 chance of being able to vault over and through to safety. I cannot for the life of me tell you what the game uses to determine what chest high wall you can and cant vault over. This 'feature' has left me hanging on numerous occasions with no cover and in the line of fire. Other times when you find yourself on walkways above ground, the camera will be forcefully pulled downwards if you get anywhere near a chest high railing or a window, again, getting you killed in the process. And just to round off my rant on chest high walls, sometimes, seemingly at random, you are simply not allowed to aim over a wall, leaving you to watch a wounded enemy scamper away to safety. I honestly wouldnt have cared this much about how the game handles interactions with cover if it wasnt for the fact that the game specifically has a COVER MECHANIC. You are expected to use cover to survive, but in this game its clunky, unresponsive, confusing and it gets you killed.  Lastly my final complaint is the lock on targeting system. I'm sure it can be a great help, and god knows with the way people are teleporting around whenever they use melee attacks you find yourself almost forced to use it. Problem is the lock on is unreliable. It can take you sometimes 3-4 clicks to disengage a lock on a target, which is plenty of time for you to die in the heat of battle, because the lock on will follow an enemy through walls and has no apparent self termination. If you get a lock on the opponent you were hoping for then good luck using it for much other than melee attacks, cause at least with every Orc weapon, you will be firing far above your opponents head within half a second of pulling the trigger, again getting you killed. In general the melee weapons seem FAR too powerful to me. Unless you are playing the jetpack loadout or the shield loadout (which not all factions have), then you are â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of luck if someone gets close to you and starts swinging. 9Â½ out of every 10 fights in this game devolve into a melee fight within seconds, because, comparatively, the guns do little to no damage and will always loose to a sword.  I will say that even in the short time that I have played, even though I honestly havent enjoyed myself for 90% of the time, and often felt cheated by the game's mechanics, I have experienced brief moments of glory, when I've charged a hill with 20 other Orcs fighting out way to an objective and performing incredibly satisfying finishing moves on downed opponents. Its just not enough when core mechanics are working against the game.
13703	Been following the game's progress since its announcement and got it early this year. I am a big 40k fan and was hoping for the best but the developers are incapable of making any kind of respectable or worthy progress of how much this game costs.
13704	Right now its just too unbalanced. I've been playing since early release and I will admit, it's gone up and down. But at the moment, it feels more like CoD but with a Space Marine skin. If thats what your into, you'll like this. I get tired of being one-shot the second I rez though.
13705	Its disgusting to see a developer promise so much to consumers and then chop and change their mind without warning and essentally steal peoples money. This game is NOT what they promised, it is still not complete and alot of features are missing. 
13706	The game is unplayable on a 3.2g core i7 with Titan $1k video card.  Its also very boring, not very imaginative, and just atrocious. I played for an hour, and asked for a refund.  While I *LOVED* the dawn of war series, outside of that it seems the 40K series of games is pretty underwhelming :(
13707	tl:dr - Buy when the price drops to ~$20 or there are major revisions.  Update: Still not enough balances to make it worthwhile. Game balance changes are happening and they are happing with frequency, they are not actually making the game better. While I approve of the pace, the fact the Devs have chosen the wrong things to fix first simply means that the game is slowly dying out. Skilled players are leaving the game because its unbalanced or the horrible rubber banding that occurs.   I keep playing hoping for some improvements but I feel at this point in time its almost too late, too bad for the game. Just take a look at the player statistics prior to buying this game and judge for yourself. READ other reviews or the EC fourm prior to purchase. You have been warned. Twice.  Orginal Review: I had really high expectations for this game. I really did. I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt. But there are some major issues as a player who has not played any of the beta/alphas. The game suffers from poor documentation, lack of variety, and some extremely interesting design choices. Space Marines are the iconic reason why I chose to play this game, so figure that bias in when reading. (SM = Loyalist Space Marine)  First off when looking at the SM (which I will comment only from their point of view, it was all i could stand), very few of the important pieces of war gear are unlocked, the ever important anti vehicle weapons. So running around the battle field as a lowly Brother, trying to earn requistion points (think experience points) to purchase upgrades was a bit daunting. Basically the game play goes like this - run for a minute or five to get to combat or strategic point. Die to sniper. Run back. Die to melee jumper who rubber banded on to your face and seemingly one shotted you. Run back, comrades have just taken the point. Get run over by your own team on the way to the next point. Respawn marginally closer, get poisioned (one hit/kill with DOT - Orcs/Chaos) or get mdps'ed extremely fast by the other races. Respawn. See an enemy crawling along and teammate about to die (ignore the teammate, 90% of the time everyone else does) execute enemy. Get killed while doing so. Respawn. Get sniped by vehicle weapon. Respawn. Get sniped by anti vehicle weapons. Respawn. Shoot the frustratingly inaccurate bolter (pistol/sniper/rifle it literally doesn't matter they all have the shot pattern of a jihadist firing an AK-47 on full auto) around enemies. Attempt to mdps. Stun an enemy, only to have the game not recognize your charged hit on them, they recover and kill you. Respawn....   There are some major issues (again remember my bias), it seems that melee combat is broken. I've lost to the first tier of melee weapons while using the powerfist (best tier supposedly), its simply to slow to matter/counter effectively. I understand that the timing of attacks is critical with the slower weapons, but I yet to win a duel vs any of the faster hitting weapons with the power fist. It is a viable strategy to spam fast attack against power fists/claws and win. This needs to get re-balanced. And the Eldar, if you play any of the other races you will learn to loathe them as they are frustratingly good at EVERYTHING (so if you want to be overpowered play them); iconic reaper rifles are litterally laser beams of death on the battle field. It seems the Eldar, Orcs, and the Chaos Marines didnt skip marksmenship day like every Loyalist Space Marines did.   In the end until there is a rebalance and a ton of polish added to the game I suggest that you skip it or wait until the game lowers in price.   Did I mention you can spend real cash to get weapons that do not have earnable equivalents. The game tries to keep it f2p but they need money some way...  Also save all your points under advancement until you earn the first Armor upgrade, then you last ten full seconds instead of the five without it.  End rant.
13708	Really hard to get into this game at all.   Eldar and Orks running through Heavy Machine Gun fire is BS!  Sick of having the drop on somoene and putting a few rounds into them, only to have them turn and fire or charge me for the kill.  Game makes no sense.  I understand you want things to be balanced but being outgunned at range when you have a heavy bolter and they have have standard weapons is BS!
13709	First am a huge 40k Fan and been waiting for a good 40K game to play, I was looking forward for this but after I played it here's my issues with it:  1. ingame shop that sell everything that looks good in this game  2. broken combat, you get stunned all the time, you get killed in 2 hits   3. bugs all over the place   4. I spent all my matches getting killed in a funny way bam bam dead   5. the shooting is not fun at all, in accurate guns, and small jumpy Eldar   I don't recomend this game or supporting such developers, even if it goes F2P it feels like a huge wast of time
13710	DO NOT BUY! The game is still buggy AF and isn't near worth half the price. what you get:  Grand battle - 50-60 player match where you have to break a gate and capture A and then B on time. defenders have limited lives. you can spawn tanks and support vehicles, not that they can get used much as they are used to break the gate and then immediatly become useless as all paths beyond 10 meters from the gate are blocked.  skirmish battle 30-40 people fight over A B C points. this is the only mode where tanks and such can be used decently and they still aren't that feared.  Lair - fight tyranids in a group of 5. in this mode you can look forward to horrible ai that races toward you if it's melee only to get stuck alot or has the 'i spawn here i shoot from here' sentimentality for the ranged  4 races and approximately 6 subclasses - you start by picking a race and a faction ex. space marine - ultra marines and then you can edit and play with the setups of each subclass.  leveling! and loot crates! - cause who doesn't love the idea of leveling your charatcher and hoping you get a decent weapon for your hard earned fighting. The game actually punishes you if you use a custom setup (until you get loads of loot crates!) as there are some pretty strong presets, which you aren't told about.  animations and models from the space marine game from 2011! - yes you read it, the actual models from this game are nearly 100% copy pasted from the space marine game. they were litterally allowed to use the models waaay back when they started working on it and since then they've only lowered the details on each figure, since the game was meant for 400 vs 400 battles.  Stupid building/map design - the game just screams 'â¥â¥â¥â¥ any level of realism just add â¥â¥â¥â¥ so it people have cover!' most of the buildings are designed to only elevate or cover you as you run around the map, The worst example of this is the 4+ story building which only contains a ramp leading up to a balcony so you can snipe.
13711	I had high hopes for this and defended the developers until the end, but long story short: I'm tired of waiting for this to get good, and the game would need another year of work to get even interesting.   The gunplay is mediocre at best and the performance of the game is ludicrous!  Open-world turned into a map split into 6 battlezones, and the RPG boils down to a bare bone perk-tree. Menu navigation is a sore.   Even as a hardcore 40k fan: don't! .. just, don't bother with this!   beHaviour failed on delivering not only the promissed product but even at including state-of-the-art features and a stable performance!  ((btw I'm ashamed by seeing streamers give a positive review though they stoped playing the game after release! ))
13712	Another Warhammer game ruined because it was handed to a developer nobody had ever heard of.
13713	False Advertising.  long story short they say it's MMO and persistent world.  It's not.  Right now at launch it's around 8 maps lobby shotter with 40k skins.  Only persistent thing is your characters and that's mostly due to the in game store where you purchase decorative versions of armor parts for real money.  more then that on launch day dev team switched the info-graphic image without notifying anyone minimizing the content promised for the game.  __________________________  Entire process was mix of incompetence and dishonesty.  Do yourself a favor don't purchase this game if you don't want to play a lobby shooter.  Also at that, current version 1.0 is borken and unblanced with massive performance issues.
13714	  Laggy and unplayable, unbalanced.
13715	My first refund. nuff said.
13716	Just another bad 40k game
13717	 Early Access Review
13718	This is not only dissapointing, it is disgusting! Not just scam, but plain robbery! As a dedicate 40k fan, i ve pre-ordered the game much earlier than most of you have heard of it, it wasnt even on steam, again and again i was robbed of the special equipment i gained as a founder, for months and months i am waiting to see this game becoming smth more than a lame SM mode, but i never flamed it, not for it bugs, slow developing, nor its pitiful state! But now after they dared to call this abomination a full game and officially launch it for 50 euros, they asked for it! Where is the open world? Where are the tyranids? How in the warp can this game be considered finished? In what sense? What dimension? 50 euros for this beta is one of the biggest jokes there are on Steam...
13719	I've been dipping in and out since the Early Access Alpha.  This game isn't launch ready, not even close. It needs at least another 6 months in the oven, probably more. It's buggy, ugly, lacking basic features. Basically, it's still in early access, they just slapped 'launch version' on it.
13720	Im not here to talk about the pros because there is next to none,  CONS: -melee &gt; guns (so whenever you play against eldar,your â¥â¥â¥â¥ed)  -places where only specific races can get at  -squad quantity is never an advantage; at long range all you need is an rpg which most people bought(PTW)  -The ranking is so sloggy because of the weak tutorials  -The only thing i hate least because its a bug is that ENEMY vehicles only appear when they're 1 metre from you at full speed   -you always have to chose 'BATTLE NOW' which just throws you into a random pvp match which 9/10 your side is about to lose,(tyranid PVE dosent work at ALL!;(you die in 2 waves)   FINAL POINT:we have seen this in eternal crusade,we have seen this in space hulk deathwing  STOP HYPING GAMES WORKSHOP GAMES;all they do is get unreal â¥â¥â¥â¥ing engine and make a cancerous little playboy game and give it tons upon tons of attention that when bought turns out to be SH*T,and ontop of that they are NEVER going to fix it:its just so you play on it for more than 2 hours so you cant refund it.  Games workshop,please go back to making good board games,because as much as you want to,you cant keep up with this day and age.I hate this game and its the reason i didnt buy(and why its mostly negative reveiws)space hulk deathing *_*

13722	 Early Access Review
13723	Unbalanced, Ignorant, click mashing play. Basically exactly like the tabletop. Buy at your own peril.
13724	 Early Access Review
13725	No.. Simply No.. I bought it for the orcs.. Figure finally.. Orks... And what i get? We got no execution animation.. We slow as â¥â¥â¥â¥.. We die as easy as anyone else.. We hardly got any customisation options.. There are no nobs.. No warbosses.. Just boys everywhere.. And what I hear this game is no longer in early access.. What a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing joke..   It's been rushed out to meet demand and to lower the cost on development.. Sure I say it may be one of the better Warhammer 40k games out there.. Consider there allot of worse ones in that gene.. But No.. This is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t.. Chaos and space marin Are so fleshed out.. With so much to put on the table.. But since orks was the last to be added.. They suffered the most..  Consider what this game was to be.. Planetside 4 sides fighting 24/7 full war.. And what It is now.. A jump in match one tema v one team.. Where balance is not considerd..   No.. Refund Plz..
13726	The vision of this game was something that got a lot of players interested however a few years down the line what was promised and what i bought into is two different products. The final release of this game is unbalanced and still rough round the edges.  It may be and indie studio but if they are charging full price for the game they will be judged as such i cannot at this point in time reccomend this game for full price this is not a finished game nowhere near finished. They say theyre going to update the game for free but these updates shouyld have been in the game that launched and not some future dlc.  In summary its an ok game but far from finished and needs a lot more balancing and needs the content adding that was promised from the start once that has change my review will change.
13727	I didnt expect anything special about this game, actually i didnt even care about the open world issue, i just wanted a fun wh40k game i could enjoy like space marine, but the game is too unpolished and lacks so many things that i cant even enjoy it as a simple lobby shooter. -Really bad animations -not well optimized -Lacks many weapons which i thought they were going to be at launch, like the thunderhammer. -I didnt get the armors i bout with RTP long ago -Voice acting.... -feels really cluncky and unresponsive -Customization is actually really small, not many items for SM or Eldar. -I hate the loot box system personally.  and many other issues...
13728	With a heavy heart, I thumb down this game. There is a great potential in it however the unfinished state of the game is causing more frustration, than joy. since the game officially launched, they can't hide behind the early access excuse. To be fair rumor has it it was pushed out early, for full price. This game in the current state NOT worth that much money. If you see it for a half price sale, than maybe. Other reviews point out the fact that this isn't what it was promised, a Planetside in the 40k universe. I personaly don't care about that. All I need is a decent shooter in the 40k universe. unfortunayely this isn't. The choppy animations, lack of accurate hit detection, etc. makes the shooting in a shooting game unenjoyable. The bigges problem with the game in my opinion is the melee. The rightclick spam, autotargeting in melee!!!! disgusting. Also if you a new player, you will find yourself playing with and against players who play this game for ages and they have the shiny armor, better weapon, advancements. The higher tier items are better, so you die more easily. Some people like that, me not so much.   Because of my love for the 40k universe, I supported this game with a founder pack long time ago. I'll play the game in small doses until it gets better, and I hope it will get there somewtime, when I can recommend it with a clear concience.  To finish on a high note, there are good, enjoyable thing about this game too. They seem to workinging on polishing, debugging the game, so it should be OK in about 6 months time. The general 40k feeling of the game is pretty good (this is the only reason I'm still playing this game). Customisation is getting there, you can make a really Orky, Space Marine-y character. The advancement system is workable.
13729	The game may be out now, but its still riddled with bugs, performace issues, graphical errors and a whole manner of other problems. It plays like a late alpha rather than a released product for $50. The melee system is bug and only works half the time, which is surprising because its only spam light attacks or charge for a heavy attack. Devs also lied about the original game, changed the scope to a significantly smaller game and still didn't finsh it. NEVER BUY EARLY ACCESS
13730	I want to like this but I cannot recommend it.  Every match lags because all the servers are based in the US. So when they bring out EU servers, maybe the rest of the world can enjoy the game.  At the moment you die behind corners, get out shot, get lag battles and lose and the only time it feels fair is when EVERYONE is lagging. Which is no great excuse.  Game does feel good and has some ideal goals an I hope to see them come to fruition.  Wait if in US and get in sales.  Don't buy if you are in the EU until EU support is given.
13731	Just disappointing.
13732	 Early Access Review
13733	Unless you fancy spending three days trying to trick the game into letting you past the login screen, don't bother. 
13734	My updated review. Game is not that bad as some claims. It is playable, it could be a lot of fun it progressing and have potential. And it is wh40k fps! With four playable factions, different classes and vehicles. It have great potential but as someone who watched it eveloving for months of EA I will tell you - Iit will not reach it any soon. Issues: - Performance is horrible. You need have very good rigs to run it well. - Ranged/mlelee classes balance is totally broken. This game is fps slasher with elements of shooting. Mechanics as aouto-lock in melee and maps design are favouring melee classes. - Bugs. They are being fixed by still there are a lot of them. Who likes stuck in a knee high terrain at the edge of magma river to find that only way out is suicide? - Cover system just sucks - Boring mission objectives. Missions are varied but every skirmish is running from one objective to another. This makes game very repetitive. 2 months after release we still have 2 broken maps (Zedek and Maggon). They have been removed and 'fixed' courple times and still are close to impossible to win for one side of match. - No voice chat. Can you belive it? PvP cooperative game without voice chat??? - Still unfinished store - lots of visual customs missed. Half of them looks just awfull and the rest is very expensive. - Missing content. Game was founded as AAA title promissing tons of elements. Lot of them was abandoned during development others moved for 'post launch'. No open world,no guild ships, no massive battles (30vs30 is max), no players objectives, no bikes, no heroes and warlord classes, no 1000 of weapons. - Progress pace. Devs are working on upgrading game. But they are incompetent. Melee system still far from being completly fixed - it never worked as it should. Every patch or content update is announced for specific day and then delayed for days or weeks. When it cames it fix 3 bugs and creates 2 more to be fixed in a future. - Horrible comunication with customers. 1. Forum is heavily moderated, criticism is bashed by game defenders reports and devs are comming with closing threads. 2. 99% of threads going unnoticed by devs. Posting your suggestions or ideas will not meet with any response. 3.Shady development - noone realy knows what is their plan and what are their goals for next year or month. Noone really knows where game is heading. Once upon a time we had some 'info' pops out from review with press or some photo shown us by devs. Those things are cousing hype and then after months noone really remebers about it and they are nowhere to be seen. If you are really hardcore wh40k fan - you can give it a shot. But don`t expect anything great. Watch gameplay videos, check your pc, ask about opinions. Other players outside of wh 40k fanbase - leave it. Wait for 6 months at least and then see how it evolved and if it is still alive.
13735	This game is fun but marketed completely wrong. It is a lobby shooter, that you have to buy, with overpriced cash shop options for customization. Piled on top of poor optimization, â¥â¥â¥â¥ maps, flatout game crashes. Its like the devs want constant cash flow like FTP title but still want to charge you full price for the game.
13736	Got the founder pack promised a planet side 2 like game. Got a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥ arena shooter game feels very unfinished DON'T BUY!
13737	Unfortunately, this is a game that is unfinished and mediocre at best in its current state.   I'm a diehard 40k fan, and have always been a bit skeptical about this release. It's unfinished, controls are clunky, graphics are outdated by years, sound is offensively bad to the point of comical, melee feels unintuative, Map design is lacking and it feels incredibly unbalanced.  I really do hope this game can turn around into something playable.
13738	Currently close combat and range feel actually rather awful. I honestly cannot recomend this game especially the advertising going on with the main page. Just about everything on it is not in this game and I ordered this way back in the day as well. Only after about a year from alpha are we already past beta and into release. Just too much for too little.
13739	dislike becasue i payed like 50 quid for planetside style warthammer, got this, cant get money back, if they make it decent ill change my review till then i wouldnt waste ya money on it, tis a shame
13740	Reminds me of the Space Marine game that came out years ago but without any of the good stuff like content or smooth gameplay.  Just dont buy it.
13741	Melee system is buggy. 'Master crafted' weapons are the equivelent of shooting yourself in the foot. Little to no reason to use them over standard weapons. Lascannons only see use on fortress maps because of requirements to fire. Orks have very little effective AT, Super Stikk bomb works half the time. Other factions can kill tanks in ~10 seconds with Melta weapons. Plasma cannon balance has not been addressed since the release of the Alpha. Abysmally poor faction balance. Endless list of broken promises.  Avoid until all the above has been resolved.
13742	Just isn't fun. Generic third person gameplay. Not much else to say. Just not worth your time if the base gameplay isnt fun 
13743	  When the lag is under control you get a pretty fun team shooter game with large maps and lots of little bitz that feel very 40k.  When the lag is undercontrol. Which isn't often and frequently things seem to teleport around too much. With the power of melee attacks this is a pretty serious problem.  The graphics are functional, your chatacter will have lots of decent details like seals and such. But objects in the world are 'meh' at best.  Since I wasn't part of the Planetside 2 pre-order promise crowd I'm not carrying a lot of bitterness. But still at full price the way it's performing now this game isn't worth it. If you can catch it at half price and you LOVE 40k then maybe in its current state it's worth it. If they fix the lag issues then it'd be a 20-30 dollar title. But the full price even then would be too much.  
13744	Unless you fancy spending three days trying to trick the game into letting you past the login screen, don't bother. 
13745	Decently fun game, but not even remotely close to what was promised and clearly unfinished.
13746	Got it's fun moments, but really belongs to early acces.  
13747	so very sad that such a great idea was ruined this game is horrible and i was duped into the 80$ founder program
13748	The game was kicked out early and I get that. The game isn't what it's kickstarted promised, I get that. But the balance of the game just seems to be awful. Eldar run about twice the speed as anyone else with minimal reductions to their health. Chaos and Eldar have ranged healers who can hide around walls healing teammates. Chaos has a giant shield bubble that heals people within it. Loyalists have â¥â¥â¥â¥ all, it takes around 15-20 bolter rounds to bring down anything meanwhile good luck if anyone decides to shoot at you..  Overall despite it's not living up to the kickstarter it could be a lot of fun if the balance didn't feel so off. Oh and the game is laggy, but I'll forgive them that because of them being forced to release early. Assuming the devs care to, it could be developed into a worthwhile game.
13749	As a player who backed the game with a basic package during the early-access phase, I can't help but feel disappointed with the state of the game at launch. Eternal Crusade has the makings of a good game, but the release feels very rushed. The gameplay is not consistent enough for a full launch (sometimes you may have a fun firefight, or a decent melee duel; however, the game mechanics can make for more frequent frustrating experiences than fun ones). Finally, there is the issue of the missing mmo features that were expected. At this point, it is nothing more than an arena shooter with one gamemode - capture the point. All I can hope for is that regular updates will get around to addressing things like lack of game mode variety and fixing the extremely low time to kill (I'm supposed to be wearing power armor, not paper armor)!
13750	Having already been released I would expect it to be 10x better than it actually is.   Pros - Larger scale battles than space marine  Cons - moving is horrible. everything feels like it moving through water and is still a bit unsure about how to get its limbs to work.  -the game still looks terrible, playing on 4k everything still looks washed out.  -have not been able to get one pve map started. just get stuck in a room for 15 mins or until people leave  - the sinking feeling of being excited for another pile of early access (we promise it will get better) garbage
13751	pre ordered this game becuase i was lead to believe it would be something completly different than what the game currently is. Last time i will ever pre order a game.   this game could become great but right now i can not give it a thumbs up. i could change my mind depending on how the game changes over time.
13752	Dont Buy now ! To Laggy ! Bad Graphics ! Bad Voice Acting ! Bad Performance ! No MMO ! No Koop, no its not Koop. its very bad implemented ! No PVE ! No Loot ! AND You must pay real money for customisation, well this is a big â¥â¥â¥â¥ you in tha face ! Better play Space Marine from Relic !
13753	Early Access game rushed out with most features missing. Game was a big mess before release and is still is at release. Bad performances, bad netcode and so many bugs.
13754	It's a buy to play game with microtransactions.  It's not feature complete as they said it would be around the time I bought myself into the Early Access. It's still buggy and awkward to play.  Just. Dont.
13755	___________________________________________ Edit: Was going to go back and redo the review after I put some real hours into it and talk about gameplay, but the Devs seem to have forgot too.   Just know: the loot isnt ballanced the weapons arn't ballanced the classes aren't ballanced  the races arn't ballanced the teams arn't ballanced ___________________________________________   One word: Unfinished.   -The textures and units look like they were made for when it was supposed to be an open world mmo type game. clipping is everywhere, texture are stretched on the ground almost as as much as it isn't. the lack of detail for the units is also weirdly limited, especially sense its its warhammer, ie: super over the top ornate Gothic make your own guy the way you want name brand warhammer 40k  -The animations are extremely clunky and very basic for Xenos, it wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't 3rd person and your looking at your guy wave is arms around like a spaz. also you feel like your gliding on ice, you have no weight. remember when you sprinted in Space Marine? how you crunched real hard on each foot showing how heavy and armored you are? yeah nah, its your arms and legs just go faster.  -The sounds are almost like place holders, there is no depth to them. its very out dated feeling. If there is ambient sounds, I don't notice them at all. Your supposed to be in a huge battlefield but all you hear is the 2-3 sound of your gun shooting. And zero voice over guy or squad yelling semi relevant things, like GRANADE! or THEY ARE TAKING BASE A!  -The FPS and sceen tearing is a huge problem. trying to shoot at a guying running at you with an axe is greatly effected. not to mention there is friendly fire so pick out the baddy in a melee is a real test. or when you are trying to not get run over by a tank. you can very easily miss what killed you.  -the advancement and weapon unlocks are kinda clunky and unintuitive, not sure if this is what they wanted it to be, but it sure isn't what I want.   -also another not sure if this is what they wanted, but no lobby or sever list, its just click here to fight GOODLUCK! you dont get to chose who you fight either, so you will be mostly fighting off the EMRAHS CHOSEN over and over again.   When this game was announced WAAAAY long ago, I was into it, but I personally never pre-order or early access games. out of a sense of loyalty to the IP but contempt for the pushed up release, I got it off a key selling site for 30 dollars. get Vermantide instead. its a real game unlike this.  Fast and dirty review, I just couldn't let it go, the devs are asking for positive reviews because its at 68% and thus mixed. The fact that they think 70% is good enough is extremely telling.
13756	I had high expectations of the game but changes on the originall plan (open world, Free to Waagh, massive games) and the fact that the game has been released at early beta state makes me think this games purchase was mistake. (i did preorder this game before most of the promises had been broken)   Combat feels currently lackluster and clunky at best (i compare gameplay flow to Battlefield 4/Battlefield 1)   UI for the game has been designed for Consoles not for PC. (double verification system for loadouts is good example) (look how example planetside 2 version works on loadout and see where you have gone wrong it is not perfect but atleast it woks 100 times better than the eternal crusad system)  If i could i would want to get refund for the game since it has been released now 1 more game that did not fullfill its promises but atleast i dont have to spend dime more to it ever again.  I am willing to Review my writing IF they remake the whole thing to include everything that was promised.  I wonder if they could have bought the licence for planetside 2 engine and work with that i think it would have worked better than what this is.  TL.DR   1. Game did not fullfill the promises it was given originally 2. Game has been released at EARLY beta state 3. It was never supposed to be Console game (and many aspects of the game have been designed to make it console friendly at the expense of actual gameplay/UI)
13757	why did i buy this game  why
13758	Released far too early. Serious balance issue with both ranged weapons and with melee. New player experiance is....rough to be polite. On the plus side the artwork look good and the animations are OK. Frankly still in alpha with most of the game modes underpopulated
13759	The idea of a massive shooter involving WAR40K lore looked very appealing at first but there are simply too many downsides to this game at present. The visuals are plain antique and the framerate drops make the experience quite painful on large maps. since the early access is over i have only thin expectations regarding server migration or graphic engine evolution but i'll keep hanging around to see if things get better and hopefully they will. Playing Space Marines Vs Orks battles the scale of a classic Battlefield game are simply the most enchanting perspective to me!!
13760	I bought this hopping i could fight like a space wolf. Not a fairy gotta hit others 4+ times while they hit me once , stun me and shoot me in a melle fight. Was one fight i had Hit A enermy 15+ times,well at least on my screen and he ran away and got his team mates to kill me ..... game seems broken too me ......just got a refund
13761	Hands down the literal /worst/ purchase I have ever made of a full priced game.  It's awful in every way possible, horrifically buggy, horifically laggy, broken, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ lying devs and a general lack of care for anything other than a quick cash grab, stay clear of this product, which I could get a full refund.

13769	 Early Access Review
13770	Having already been released I would expect it to be 10x better than it actually is.   Pros - Larger scale battles than space marine  Cons - moving is horrible. everything feels like it moving through water and is still a bit unsure about how to get its limbs to work.  -the game still looks terrible, playing on 4k everything still looks washed out.  -have not been able to get one pve map started. just get stuck in a room for 15 mins or until people leave  - the sinking feeling of being excited for another pile of early access (we promise it will get better) garbage
13771	I'm a founder and I paid for a MMO. I got a buggy and unoptimized lobby shooter instead.  Do not buy.
13772	I wanted to like this game but I could not even get into it. The combat feels clunky and the game feels unoptimized. It does run slightly better than it did during CBT. The only reason to play this game is if you REALLY love 40k lore.. and even then it probably isn't worth your time.
13773	the game is simply not what you think it is, and it has little potential to become what you hope to become.  small studio has very little chance to handle genre and title like this
13774	Frame rate drop at times is shocking and makes the game unplayable. Suppression mechanic that magically f**ks your aim is stupid. It should be a great game but its so poor. Space Marine was a far better game this, there is no way this is worth Â£40 and adding micro transactions is just greedy.  The Idea of the game is good, but the execution is poor.
13775	This is basically a worse, more laggy, more buggy version of the Space Marine Multiplayer. It is in no way shape or form what us early access supporters were promised. Not even close.   I'm serious, I re-installed and checked it out, Space Marine Multiplayer is far superior to this. The animations are better, the lobby system is better. Play balance? Space Marine has it. Hit detection, yes sir! Cameras that don't hide behind terrain or other players, got those too... Avatar customization without having to pay real money after purchasing a FULL PRICED title, yeah, Space Marine has that. Single Player campaign? Wow, it has one of those too, crikey it's an actual fully fleshed out game. Unlike Eternal Crusade which has approximately zero of these things.  My play time is very low for a simple reason, I kept popping into the game from time to time to check progress, and apart from UI and 'finished' textures. It was unplayable from day one and is still unplayable now. This game is a steaming pile of bad development decisions and poorly considered budget cuts.  The FOV for aiming at opponents is horrible and often obscured by the environment. The cameras overall are miserable and track the player in an awkward fashion.  There is about zero balance in the classes / races. Hit detection seems to use a RNG as well as the amount of damage done. I'm sure you can probably find something in the store that unlocks proper aiming or live rounds for your firearm.  The animation system is clunky and the animations are stilted, awkward and simply look bad. There is no difference in the appearance of a fully armored character and one with robes or no armor, their walk / run cycles are identical and look terrible. They also take forever to complete and in a multiplayer setting, this generally means while you watch your character cycle through some animation you're not sure was the one you were attempting, some jerk with a sword has stopped by to give you the bash while you have no control over your character. Being hit doesn't even reliably break you out of an animation to play a hit reaction...   Server population and match making are also very poor. Maybe due to the price point of this very dubious arena shooter, for the same money I can buy Deus Ex or any other AAA title that will offer a fun gaming experience.  Early access is a joke and should be avoided. Steam is now using the fact that you stuck around for early access period to be over and listened to the promises the developer kept making to deny you a refund for this product. Shame on Steam and shame on the developers for releasing this pre-beta product as if it's even close to a finished product.  Support this title at your own risk. Don't say you have not been warned.  I have played Warhammer 40k since Rogue Trader was new. I have consumed almost every product associated with Games Workshop over the years and this is easily one of the poorest offerings, it really looks more like a mobile port than something you're being charged AAA money that had a 'full' development cycle with a solid Publisher.
13776	I have never reviewed a video game before, this is my 1st and I have been gaming since I played Jet Set Willy. This is the only time I have felt strongly enough to do so.  Currently this game is not worth the money.   I had been watching it for a year or so and finally, being an avid Warhammer fan, decided to make the leap a couple of weeks before launch.   For an Alpha game, the performance issues and bugs were acceptable as I assumed they were being worked on, however, very little has changed since launch and the game is not in a state where I would actually consider it fit for launch.   We are now essentially beta testing a paid for game for the devs. Add to this, the mess they have made of the dreaded micro transaction system for weapon skins etc, my honest advice would be to leave this well alone.
13777	They should of just taken more time developing this game than going from alpha to its full release, because it just isn't ready in its current state. It just has too many issues for a full release game that is $50. So if I were you, I would wait and see if they fix the major issues with this game first and also add more stuff to justify the $50 price tag.
13778	Warhammer - Eternal Crusade,  Wow, I can be short. This game is just bad in almost every aspect.  Graphics and sound are okay. But, the maps are badly designed, there's still no campaign and forget everything from the store page. Except for the ingame store. That seems to function pretty well. Anything else, including the community is just a disgrace. I'm really sorry for the people who enjoy this game, but in my book it's not Warhammer 40K at all.   Also here's a clarification from what you see on the store page:  4 playable factions: You can join any of 4 teams; they all spout the same classes so it doesn't mean a thing, because we have no actual clue what Warhammer 40K is all about.  Multiple Classes: Is our way to tell you that we came up with some very unique classes which you see in any generic arena shooter like Battlefield. We didn't really want to put too much effort in it, because we thought that it would work out anyway and it takes a lot less effort and creativity from our end.  Persistent world and characters: This features was kinda forced upon us, due to our bad servers and lag spikes. We didn't really code that persistence in. It's a feature that comes automatically with our servers because they forget to update in the right way.  Free expansions: We really don't like this, but we're forced to. Because it's the only way we can lure in new people by presenting them lots of new re-skins or items with different stats. Ofcourse, we made sure it's only of use if you leave some serious cash in the ingame store. Which, we made sure of, works really well. But, we're glad that reskinning and changing stats doesn't really require that much effort. For the stats we use some dice or random number generator. We can't be hassled with reading through all those nonsense Warhammer fan books and rules.
13779	whatever you do DONT BUY THIS GAME my reasons: 1. It feels like a free2play game (including the obligatory real world currency) despite costing 50 bucks 2. they betrayed their own community by claiming the game to be an MMO and giving them a generic lobby shooter 3. (my weakast point) the game is a buggy mess as of now. yes they did promise to fix that but they promised a lot of things... 4.There are better free2play options to this. yes the ip might be tempting but the game Heroes &amp; Generals does a lot of the things this game does only far better
13780	Big hopes, disappointment as a result. Year of lost hope, ugly graphics and lot of bugs and problems.  Balance and development solutions is my personal nightmare for years, so: 0/10 crawling and screaming loyalists.  
13781	Do not buy this game its nothing that is has promised!
13782	Bought during the sale, thought it would be worth a gamble and I have been following it for sometime.   If I was closer to their servers I would be OK with the game however for me being in the UK the server response time is 150ms which made it unplayable.   Refund requested
13783	I'd say wait on the game if you are on the fence. It really wasn't at all what I expected. The game feels very poorly made. The persistent world was very static and lazily done and worst of all, the gameplay felt wrong. The characters moved poorly, the vehicles behaved poorly and the customization was non existant. The game is differently still early access, the company clearly is far, far behind schedule meaning that their development team is struggling.   The biggest let down was the 'persistent world'. It was represented a poorly photoshoped map with colored regions that are supposed to represent what territory each faction owns. The regions are split into this race vs this race and felt extrememly disconnected from the actual game. It feels very phoned in to the point were it was most likely a panic decision made by the devs when they realized their team wasn't talented enough to create the game they originally sold. Hopefully, the money they collect from this presale will allow them to revamp the game and make it what it should be.
13784	This is a clunkier battlefield heroes with a WH40k theme. Balance, UI, progression, netcode, graphics, sounds, animation... all on the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ side of the gaming spectrum. Not worth a $50 price tag with microtransactions and RNG equipment progression on top.

13791	I theory it's a fun game. In practice it's too frustrating to really enjoy.  Another 40k game that isn't worth the money :( 
13792	BEWARE! DO NOT BUY!   This game will thoroughly disappoint you. I'm a backer from way back, and can tell you, what they deliver doesn't even come close to what is, and what was promised. Once again, DO NOT BUY!
13793	Do not buy this game its falsely advertised.They promised us MMO open world and what did they deliver?Just a bare bones lobby shooter!This game is still in beta at best,this is a laughable launch the game should had stay in early access for 1 more year at best.
13794	Pledged Sgt level (+-80 bucks) approximately 2 days after the initial announcement god knows how many years ago because I'm not a smart man. And I let my 40k fanboy take over. The failure of that financial decision is dwarfed only by the game Warhammer 40,000: Eternal Crusade.  Don't let the meagre hours fool you, I've sank about 50+ painful hours into it before the steam release and these 6 hours are about 10 attempts after big patches to see if anything has changed. It hasn't. It is not a good video game. Do not buy this.   +40K +Everything that was done early in the development (Space marines, boltguns, some of the major level setpieces) look and feel great.  + Communication with the community  -Disaster of a company (almost every employee with a title that had 'lead'-something in it has left at some point of the development. And it â¥â¥â¥â¥ing shows) -Incredibly toxic community -Game feels half arsed at best, optimization, core mechanics, everything is just â¥â¥â¥â¥y and at this point they're too deep in development to do anything about it. -Movement has an odd floaty feeling to it, not what you'd expect from a Space Marine or an Ork. Lazy animations you could also call it. -Core systems are very very basic 3rd person cover shooter stuff... but done poorly. Cover is useless and clunky to use at best. --- Melee system. They're going at around the 5th iteration of a melee system and they've all been hot garbage and still is. Your melee attack sends you flying 5 meters towards the enemy in a comedic fashion for a basic attack and then if you don't get into an endless loop with the enemy doing the same you'll engange in furious rock - paper - scissors style of a disaster while spinning around like loonatics. It's really â¥â¥â¥â¥ing bad.
13795	It's been one hour and I've done everything.
13796	It's been one hour and I've done everything.
13797	SHOULDV'E BEEN KEPT BACK AT LEAST ANOTHER YEAR IN DEVELOPMENT - NO WHERE NEAR FINISHED.... AND JUST BAD.   i mean for gods sakes it has placeholder items , terribad balancing issues , â¥â¥â¥â¥ poor server performance , some of the worst map design ive ever seen , poor customization options , microtransactions in a game that costs Â£40.00, when you mount a hvy weapon on a wall it only hits an invisible wall 2 ft in front of it , the stupendously broken melee system i wont go on    BEh took a beloved I.P and basically buttâ¥â¥â¥â¥ed it , scamming the founders along the way. so much proomised .... so little delivered another steaming EA turd. it couldv'e been amazing mmo shooter instead we get a generic round shooter ,   not recommended x 40,000
13798	Can't even sign into the game, yeah, you get that right, i can't even play anymore. So no, sorry, but i can't recommend this game.
13799	There are only so many times you can be killed by a melee attack from 30 feet away by a Russian before it stops being fun.   Why games with very lethal melee systems seem to insist on not region locking people based on ping I will never understand. Well, I lie. I understand; it is less expensive on the devs end and gives them more audience to which to sell their product. But it ruins this kind of game, and that is a shame.
13800	From a diehard Warhammer fan. Do not buy. Buggy and unbalanced beyond belief. Gameplay is very solid. Place a high importance on zone control and tactical awareness. Sadly the game is so frustrating, that it is almost unplayable.
13801	This game could be great if it ran well. I have well beyond the recommended gpu and a step or two above the recommended cpu with the same RAM and everything else. SO despite being all around above the rec. This game is a fantastic 23 FPS on low settings. On a 30 MBPS by 15 MBPS internet connection. So it is safe to say that something is wrong. I don't know if they need to look at the optimization or what, but I am thoroughly dissatisfied. The original space marine was fantastic and this is just polished poop. It is basically the ARK of warhammer. Lots of hype with a pretty bad result.
13802	terrible let down of a game....another painful hit to the Warhammer 40k name
13803	Terrible game mechanics, Terrible community, dont bother
13804	SHOULDV'E BEEN KEPT BACK AT LEAST ANOTHER YEAR IN DEVELOPMENT - NO WHERE NEAR FINISHED.... AND JUST BAD.   i mean for gods sakes it has placeholder items , terribad balancing issues , â¥â¥â¥â¥ poor server performance , some of the worst map design ive ever seen , poor customization options , microtransactions in a game that costs Â£40.00, when you mount a hvy weapon on a wall it only hits an invisible wall 2 ft in front of it , the stupendously broken melee system i wont go on    BEh took a beloved I.P and basically buttâ¥â¥â¥â¥ed it , scamming the founders along the way. so much proomised .... so little delivered another steaming EA turd. it couldv'e been amazing mmo shooter instead we get a generic round shooter ,   not recommended x 40,000
13805	Can't even sign into the game, yeah, you get that right, i can't even play anymore. So no, sorry, but i can't recommend this game.
13806	Looked amazing is very fun with a large group like planet side 2 is.  The developers are biased towards all the factions that arent Space Marines.  Vehicles have no use after the initial siege and ground units have a very hard time destroying vehicles. I would love to love this game but the Developers have no idea how to balance a game with different factions.
13807	How about playing the campaign? The option does not reveal it stays grey. Tutorial doesn't seem to work, can only walk around, but no instructions or info there.  Is this a waste of money? Or has anybody a tip to learn this game without being butchered in multiplayer mode?! So far I would not recommend this version of WH.
13808	Now that the game has officially released, I can safely say that it isn't worth the asking price.   In all honesty, I could never recommend this game personally. It was advertised to be something else comletely. What we got is a pale shadow that still doesn't even manage to release as a working and somewhat balanced lobby shooter.   If you like the 40k universe, and if the developers' complete failure to deliver on what was promised doesn't bother you, check back in about a year to see if the game has changed for the better. It might be worth picking up on sale.   But as of release, it's a disappointing mess.
13809	Dont you ever consider sponsoring this kind of developers.  Dust 514,Defiaance. And now this!!!  W40k is doomed because of thus kind of Devs.
13810	What a dissapointment and a waste of money... a lot of players defended this game in the beta state because they had hope that this game would deliver what it promised. Instead what was delivered was a dissapointing unfinished game, guess this is not the Warhammer 40000 that I was looking for. Anyway strap on for some buggy, unbalanced call of duty like arena matches cause basicaly that is all this game is... sad for those that still have hope but I just want to say one more thing 'I freakin' told you so!'  PS: What was even a surprise for me, they inluded pay to win content, like those scoped op real money paid bolters, Chaos be damned that even made me sad... do not even bother with this game
13811	The game is oke i guess but deffinitly not worth 40,- euro. I am also detecting a hint of amateurism and desinterest amongst the develpment team (behaviour). All I am reading is about developers being on holiday and such right after and during the realease. It's comparable to a team of docters leaving a patient in the operating room with his chest still cracked opend after a heart surgery to go have some lunch first. A major issue recently where people were not able to login to both the site and the game. After waiting for a day a fix came but not from the developers but just some random dude on the official forum (he got a 100k rtc so he can buy &amp;*^%# all).  The game industry is represented here at it's foulest and I'm confident they are going to find a way to get even more money out of us.  
13812	If you're inclined to motion sickness, this game will do you wrong. If you love 40K and still want to be a Space Marine...Carnage Champions...but you didn't hear that from me.
13813	Its just a â¥â¥â¥â¥ rip off of THQs space marine. Teams are so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing broken. Exarmple i put a hole clip of a bolter into and elder and he killed me with 2 hits and it still said he had 100% health. All the teams play the same when thats not the case for them. Elder are weak but fast and have good range. Where the orks are built like a bunker but cant aim for â¥â¥â¥â¥. And the other 2 teams are â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dime gods off work and seem to be the worst races to play. Also its laggy as â¥â¥â¥â¥ most the time you cant play coz your just rubber banding around. Out of 10 iwould give it a 3. And thats coz i like 40k
13814	I don't recommend this game yet, because of the lack of content, the balancing of each race, the optimisation ( 10 FPS when big fights and i have a great setup).  I will wait for more update, maybe one day it will be like the Planetside they promised us with...
13815	Every single aspect of this game is simply uninspired.
13816	Now that the game has officially released, I can safely say that it isn't worth the asking price.   In all honesty, I could never recommend this game personally. It was advertised to be something else comletely. What we got is a pale shadow that still doesn't even manage to release as a working and somewhat balanced lobby shooter.   If you like the 40k universe, and if the developers' complete failure to deliver on what was promised doesn't bother you, check back in about a year to see if the game has changed for the better. It might be worth picking up on sale.   But as of release, it's a disappointing mess.
13817	I wish after several years of watching this game progress from its initial idea of an mmorpg set in an open world Warhammer 40,000 world into the now 3rd person arena shooter(essentially). In the past few years I became more invested in the game and watched as the developers broke their promises of the original game, and for much of that I stood strong behind them in silent support. But to be quite honest in the past year besides the addition of two races, one of which was supposed to be free to waaagh, nothing has changed. The complaints that the classes were unbalanced, the same complaints we had over a year ago. Is still one of the big topic issues today along with lack of customization, which to their credit has had a heavy improvement since the steam launch. The game is stagnant in development, they haven't really made any huge changes to the game however they have actively fixed bugs.  The void I feel with the lack of progress in this game is like a hole that just keeps getting bigger. I wanted this game to be a success from the beginning, I was ecstatic at the idea of a Warhammer 40,000 MMO again. It's only gone down hill from there.  The Pros - Weekly developer updates - Actively involved development and management (They are great on twitter, twitch, discord, and youtube)  - Actively fix bugs - Clan Community 50/50 - Not pay to win  The Cons - Rushed released and development - The game is in Alpha - Not open world  - Unbalanced - Stagnant development - Clan Community 50/50
13818	Broken and unfinished.
13819	As it stands I can't recommend this game. It has such potential and so much was promised that just was not delivered on. I made the mistake of buying into that promise: Open World, Epic combat game. It just doesn't deliver what it was supposed to.  That being said, I think this game still has the potential, but it is no-where near ready to be called 'Full Release'. If anything this is in the late stage Alpha/Early Beta.

13825	I Might be asking for my money back Soon cause this game is nothing What a fair game should be. First you Have The Jump pack marines combined with powerfists which makes them unbeatable cause alll you have to do is click and turn click and turn and thats all and you'll kill everything around you. Then the Chaos Get powerfists as well so same problem only they can just heal by walking by people but the Marines you have to get up agaisnt them. And the Eldar Can one Shot you and Hide in plain sight all in one motion with no real down flaw other then their toughness but toughness leets your live only a second longer. The Game is Melle focused which means there is no stragety to taking objects.. if one team is all close combat.. They will win all you have to do is click to win. &lt;3 (UPDATE!) Tried to get my money back from this game and ooohhh guess what i went 2 hours over the mxium time to get a refund.. are you â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ me?? whats the difference of 2 hours gameplay time? Not like i spend 3 of those 12 hours WAITING TO GET IN A GAME this isnt the first time games and Steam has F*cked me over to keep my money.  THAT was just the early acess review and guess what? now that its out its the same BS problems nothing they promised is in the game still wont return my money andthey fixed god damn nothing! There is No anything! Just a arena shooter thats it! No strat invovled no nothing just grab a melee weapon and bash each other with the over powered melee system and craptastic fighting in that melee glithing laggy and over all BS that a Eldar chainsword with kill you in two swing but a normal chainsword takes 9 years but dont worry no ones uses those anyways Its power fists and power hammers which you can just keep swinging ina circle and kill everything in one hit! Good job Devs Your no Better then No Mans Sky blow me GW for even letting this game be made but make your models more expensive then even your newest game to cover up these failed games you keep pumping out &gt;.&gt;

13831	It's a trap !
13832	This game should not have been launched as it is right now. Despite the 'early access' sign being gone it still feels just like it did months ago. There are bugs, hitching, FPS drops, sound quality issues, optimization issues, bad netcode and lagging. On top of the technical issues the game itself is underwhelming - 30v30 battles are about as big as you can go, and if you're looking to get more than 10-20 people fighting close by I hope you're ready for framerate drops.  tl;dr - this game may as well still be in EA/Beta/whatever. If you like those types of games and you want this to succeed then go ahead, but don't come in expecting a finished product. That's gonna take some time.
13833	Game needs to be finished, was rushed out too early, don't spend your money on this before it gets fixed. Waiting times are terrible and then you get kicked for idling before you can even start. The game runs so badly that people often warp about and you get killed by things you can't see.
13834	If you play in the UK or EU, dont bother getting this game till they have EU servers, its pointless to play like this and you cant choose low ping servers....  Also, the melee combat is seriously retar ded, imagin unloading a clip into a chaos space marine, only to have him stun you on his first swing and then kill you on his second swing, now im not sure if this is all lag related, but 90% of the times vs a melee, thats what happens, ive learnt the melee combat system and parrying does nothing if they just spam melee left click, forget playing warhammer 40k, this is just warhammer....chaos use nothing but melee, as do eldar, because of this i only play matchs against orks, they seem to have the fewest melee and more gunners, actually seems like warhammer 40k that way,
13835	This game started out with great lofty ambitions, got lots of people sold on the idea of a massive Warhammer 40k game, and delivered nothing. Don't be fooled, even though its no longer technically an early access title it's still Beta quality at its best, and still Alpha quality in its worst areas with nearly all major features unfinished.   THIS GAME IS NOT AN MMO, unless you consider Call of Duty or Battlefield MMO games. You queue up and join matches, thats it. The dev team has said they plan to add the 'massive' features 'in the future' but have done nothing during development to give any credit to that claim.  If you're expecting anything beyond a sub-par lobby shooter with a 40k hat on, you will be disappointed.  If you are an absolute die-hard fan of 40k that must have it, wait until it goes on sale. It's not worth $50
13836	Same repetitive gameplay, game runs way better but bland gameplay in 60fps is still bland.
13837	I expected this game to be much differently
13838	The game just isn't there yet. Come back later. Your budget can go elsewhere for a while.
13839	This game is the result of what would happen if the Battlefield series made love to the Space Marine game and had a child that was raised by Gears of War.  Ultimately, while there are faults with the game, fans of 40k aren't going to find a better game out currently, and if you're a fan of any of the titles mentioned above, it's probably right up your ally.  For 20 dollars, this meets and exceedes expectations!  I'm sorry? What? The default price is 60 dollars, and it's only 20 dollars right now due to a sale? My god.
13840	Being a 40k fan for many years, I was anticipating this 'MMO' for awhile. When I heard last year that an MMO was finally being made for 40k much like the original failed warhammer MMO from 10 years ago, I began salivating. Once you start playing it however, you almost immediately see the chinks in the armor of the game itself.   It's a lobby shooter. Not what the dev's originally promised. What I, and many others think, is that the publisher pushed it out early, knowing they would make â¥â¥â¥â¥ loads of money just on the name itself. What we have now is not entirely what was promised. There is no campaign mode yet, but hopefully its coming.  So, is it a good game? Yes. It's decent and fun for what it is. However, it is not worth the 50 bucks they are asking. I got it for 20 on a sale and only then is it worth that. I don't care about pvp and only do the horde mode content. Well, you will get very bored of that as there are only 2 maps.   The publisher should have left this sit for another year, allow for the campaign mode to come out and for all the bugs to get squashed, because there are still alot of them. Game breaking too, if you play the horde mode. Sometimes tyranid's just won't spawn, leaving you watch the timer wind down. Once it hits 0.00 everyone loses. It's a depressing way to lose a match.   Performance is hit and miss. Most of the time I'm at 60. When the game needs to load the next wave of enemies, it drops to 20. This makes it nearly unplayable when there are a ton of enemies on screen. I also play with a controller and the insanely low fps makes it extremely difficult to shoot anything. The client will also crash ALOT. In 3 hours of play I had 4 crashes. They seem to happen when loading a match. Clearly the game is still in early access despite the tag line missing on steam. It's just â¥â¥â¥â¥ing early access, say what it is.  The only thing new players can do if they are on the fence whether they should purchase or not, is wait for the campaign mode. Right now, its just a lobby shooter with horrendous ping sometimes due to the netcode and semi constant crashing. Wait for a God damn campaign and 40k fans should rejoice at that point.
13841	Don't get this game if you're in or near Australia, I constantly had over 300 ping and I've had some serious problems with it like people straight up being invincible for long periods of time.  Aside from that this game honestly isn't that great, there's some balance problems and quite a few bugs, but in addition to that the maps are designed quite poorly. The best example being one of the citadel defense maps, the second point has about 30 players firing right into 1 choke with no way to flank them, in my time playing this game I've litterally never seen the defending team loose on that map, and that design keeps coming on over to other maps, the longer you play this game, the more you'll see examples of this, in conjunction with the games dynamic spawn system it becomes messy very fast.  Your character controls very loosely, which is normally fine but gets very annoying when you try to climb down some stairs, run into a corner or another player and your character just has a mind of its own about what to do, very annoying when in combat I try to run away and clip a wall or reach a flight of stairs and my character just stops, all the while I'm being shot at.  The games camera is always in third person, it's personal preference weather you like that or not, but it does favour anyone turning a left corner, over anyone turning a right corner.  As for combat itself, I can't really say much and not be too biased because I did play the game with high ping, I can however say three things:  Melee combat needs some tweeking, currently it runs off a rock paper scissors system, light attack beats heavy, heavy beats parry, parry beats light attack, countering a parry with a heavy, or a heavy with a light has a penalty for the attacker countered aside from just taking damage, you also get stunned, however for parry countering light, the stun is there, but not until after the light attack bounces off, so this leads everyone to spam light attack, and then roll if your attack bounces off someone who tries to parry it, subverting the whole rock papers scissors system.  The suppression system is bizarre, it's there for a good reason and I'm glad that they have a mechanical suppression system aside from just taking damage, but it's very easy to suppress someone without even being able to see them, someone could be shooting at a guy 2 metres or so away from you, and you're still suppressed, as well as you being able to suppress friendlies, or have an enemy suppress you while you're in melee combat fighting someone else, which just shouldn't happen if you're locked onto him.  Friendly fire is always on, and some people will really abuse it, don't be surprised if you get into melee combat with someone, and a friend will straight up just throw a grenade at you, or gun you and him down for the kill.  Aside from everything I've mentioned here, with exeption to one topic I barely touched on, everything else is great, the game looks beautiful, the community is genuinely good it's great to see all these people role playing their class, or a space marine or orks or whatever.  As a shooter this game is poor, as a WH40K experience, it's great.
13842	I'll be short and to the point, i've played this game (if you include closed alpha/beta) over 1000 hours, it didnt launch properly is full of bugs and is very unbalanced. There is very little content on top of it with features being delayed constantly or just dropped. A good example of the games basic lack of balance is a skilled gunman is a joke in comparison to a skilled melee with jumpack/swooping hawk. I'd only say get it if you are a HARDCORE 40k fanboi or its on sale for at least half off.
13843	So, to start off, should you buy this? No, not yet and here's why.  -Faction balance It's getting there, still tons to be done, but thats not to say its awful right now. It is pretty decent at this point, ranged wise. Although heavy support weapons like the plasma cannon don't have much of an impact anymore, like, at all.  -Vehicle combat Boring and uninspired. There is very little strategy as far as positioning or weapon management is concerned and it really just needs to be completely redone. Most of the time, no matter which faction you are on, (In a main battle tank of sorts) you just have to sit there for about one and a half minutes just railing on some transport or enemy tank, because the thing is, vehicles have a lot of health but other enemy vehicles just are not effective at dealing with each other. You would be far better off buying melta bombs or using the equivalent to the melta gun. ADD VEHICLE CUSTOMIZATION, GIVE ME DIFFERENT VEHICLE PATTERNS. -Promises Honestly, what this game is in desperate need of is either, 1: More maps, more depth (More vehicles, classes, cosmetics), and more attention to balance in half the time it would usually be coming out; because at this rate the game needs to have a shock to the chest so to speak for the player base. It needs to retain the few hundred or so players that are keeping it alive and it also needs to bring more in, while at the same time getting more people to buy it. 2: Add the grand battle map, open world: An open world to bring players together. If things cannot be implimented fast enough (option 1) to deal with the dropping player base, then palyers need to have the ability to create the grand battles that they want to, and will be able to. This is evidenced by PS2, where players actively seek out the larger battle, with this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ arena lobby shooter players are restricted to one battlefield and cant really leave or use their time more effectively without quitting a match.  Personally, I enjoy the game when I am not being killed, or am playing with my clan mates, but that is only when I am winning. I would rather not make this comparison but in Planetside 2, the kind of game that this was sort of meant to be loosely designed around, as far as the mmo and scale is concerned; in Planetside I can play a good game alone. I can switch classes more to suit the role in which would be most appropriate to the situation or I can find a good spot to flank; in Eternal Crusade, you're either dying, playing jump assault (winning----&gt; NVM, our melee is hardly a strength anymore, LSM), or just getting curb stomped. It lacks the player cohesion that PS2 has, given the lack of decent communication channels and the incredibly limited role of vehicles what with the limited spawn pool. In EC if you dont have a team or a guild, you will be rage quitting within your first half hour-hour of gameplay.  Loyalist Space Marines: There are two key issues I see as a LSM player, those being the factions unique feel (overall Loadout Points) and balancing. 1. Every faction has a unique feel, with the exception of the LSM (Orkz need some work too). Even CSM's have their marks, abilities and strong weaponry. The Eldar? Speed and maneuverability, it really shows. Da Orkz? Well da boyz have dakka, they're really shooty and do a lot of damage in melee, that feels great (Orkz overall feel kind of awkward. The way they move, their model size, a bunch of the animations, that stuff all needs polishing). 2. The LSM on the other hand do not feel like SM. Everything they are in the lore has no transfer to EC. I do not want moving â¥â¥â¥â¥ fortresses, I do not want them to be op but for â¥â¥â¥â¥s sake there is almost nothing about them that feels fluffy, tactical, or durable. They just feel hollow. Even in melee LSM get â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Our last few decent upgrades like lifesteal and weapon swing got nerfed enough to make it 'okay' but no where near competitive in my opinion. SM armour is fragile and health generally low, if I had to suggest something, add more armor along with damage resistance to ranged fire, or at least an advancement for it. Tactical sucks â¥â¥â¥ to play too, and seeing as that's what I main, I have developed an incredible tolerance for getting killed.  Should you but it? No but then again, it comes down to what your tolerance level is for unfinished features and how much of a fan you are of 40k. That being said, you should give it a few months, if not a year to iron things out. That is assuming however that this game will not be abandoned.
13844	I bought this on the premise that they were making a Open World MMORPG.   What we got was COD with a WH 40K skin. Oh and there is a there is a territorial map that changes nothing about the game.
13845	Ignoring promises and all that stuff... My experience in the PvP matches so far has been something like this:  'Ok, awesome, I'll get a tactical marine and try to kill people' *2 minutes later* 'Everyone is just spamming melee and never fires because melee does twice the damage of the bolter, is a dash and also has AOE'  And thats about it, its like an FPS game mode where people run around with knives only. You can chose ranged weapons but there's absolutely no point because the armors tend to blend with the environment and the melee attack will simply decimate anyone whose general direction you are even pointing towards.  Yes, there's some extra depth to melee but it's not enough to turn this game from the run and knife people game that it is now into anything resembling a realist 40k battle scenario where people can't move into open spaces because they will get destroyed.  Add to the insane melee the fact that most objectives are downright undefendable and you got yourself a real fragfest. Though even then the game isn't tight enough to be interesting (thats with you ignoring bolters and meleeing stuff only). You end up overshooting and overshooting again because of the melee built-in dash, the opponent does as well and any hopes you had of your space marine actually feeling like a massive armored tank vanish because he's moving around like a stupid ballerina.  I paid for this game day they let us pay for it, and I still won't recommend it until they tone down the melee system to actually feel like you are controlling a space marine and not Jackie Chan when he was young. And ofcourse when they decide to make real maps that have any semblance of tactics into them and aren't just fragfest arena maps that are open to the point where you can't defend a single point. In terms of awesome battles in defendable bases, you're better off playing Planetside. Even with pubbies you feel like you're atleast making a difference there.
13846	well first this game tends to be a queing nightmare i can spend u to 15 to 25 minutes for a match. While trying to get into a match with your Guild is 25 individual invites from steam for each person before you start the match. Once your guild is in the game theres no droping in to play no join on guilds or friends. you just have to sit and â¥â¥â¥â¥ it out. The promises made in early dev to what this game is .. well its not there yet if it gets there at all. If you like arena shooters like quake with a tiny bit of tactics this is your game. But as of today its not worth the sticker price
13847	This game had so much hope, promise and potential. But when we preordered, we ordered for a world that'd have thousands of players competing for areas.   Not small maps, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ weapons and a terrible variety.  You, the developer, took what could have been the most ambitious and well polished Warhammer 40k game to date and completely turned it into â¥â¥â¥â¥.  There's little guidance in gameplay, you're left to figure things out on your own, and most of the time one faction is a hard counter for the other.  Do NOT waste your time OR money buying this garbage.
13848	Updating my earlier highly negative to a new slightly negative review.  The super aggrivating alpha level imbalances in this game have now been fixed. The player's spells will no longer kill them for the sin of attempting to cast them over a chest high wall, and (most) one hit kill issues have been fixed.  Ranged classes can still expect to be dominated by melee classes, and it's still somewhat easy to predict the outcome of a match based on which race is playing which, but at least it's possible to get a game in, not accomplish much of anything, and take home 6 skill and a few thousand requisition points for your trouble.   With a few more updates the game might reach recommended for WH40k fans territory.
13849	I dont think its appropriate to release a game when it has THIS many bugs/issues going on. The game is barely playable, which is an improvement from not playable at all a week ago. Still, at least make sure you have your netcode and general game engine issues resolved before you release a game.
13850	Game is unpolished and boring. All the races play the same, there is no MMO aspect either. Very, very shallow game. Another company wastes the 40k license.
13851	The game is no bad, not close to good either, it is half-â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, â¥â¥â¥â¥ing basic, like a lot of warhammer games when putting the 40K seal looks like enough or something.   This is not the game we were promised and even what we have is clunky, like the melee combat (that by the way has auto aim for dummies), the MMO tag in this steam page is a big fat lie, it is just like a battlefield game in third person but with small maps, no air vehicles, 3 land vehicles no customizables, almost no interaction with the map. Overalll has some good moments and some terrible ones (It is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing poorly optimized and buggy), It is like they are selling us a lamborghini and we recieved a fiat multipla,   It gets the job done but it is not what they were telling us, so i canÂ´t reward liying when this is like 25% of what we were promised.
13852	I don't usually write bad reviews, and I absolutely love the Warhammer40K franchise, but this game simply isn't anything like it was originally advertised to be when I bought into the very early alpha. Its a very generic, rather boring 3rd person shooter that happens to look like a universe many of us love. Boring gunplay, too many hitpoints, and generic classes both within and between factions make this boring, boring, boring.
13853	Be aware that the product you are buying here is not what you will be getting. It is a match-based arena shooter like Call of Duty or Battlefield. There is no 'persistent world.' There are no 'massive' battles like those of Planetside. PvE is five person co-op.

13855	Had to put more time into fine tuning all settings then actually play the game, even then with my specs being above the recommend system requirements i was around 30 FPS if I was lucky. this is fully the fault of the publisher since this game is far from done. As it is right now this game has no business being released, you are basicly building an alpha of a game that is supposed to be done. which is a shame since the core of the game is pretty good. but it's badly optimized, has a cash-shop in a 60 euro game(what the flying .... we payed for 60 for us and you can't part with a simple shoulder or gun?) the game simply doesn't even remotely deliver what it has promised. luckly i was beneath the 2 hour mark and was able to refund.   Don't expect an MMO. Don't expect an Real persistent world.  Don't expect large scale epic battles, (it's basicly a defending faction vs a faction that just throws bodies there way till they win). Don't expect any Heroes or veterans. Definitly don't expect the amount of weapons they advertise.  As a warhammer fan I just can't let my fellow warhammer fans waste money of this mess of a game.
13856	Still a melee game. still sucks. do not buy
13857	So, it's officially launched, so I thought I'd delete my old early access review and redo the review...  It's somehow worse than it was in Early Access. In Early Access (where I got the majority of my playtime) the game was relatively smooth and the combat felt tight. Right now? The combat feels incredibly clunky and half baked, like they went backwards in development.   All the races (Space Marine, Chaos, Ork, and Eldar) all seem to share the same animations, but move at different speeds which looks terrible, just awful. My Ork looked like he was trying to rush to find a toilet and eldar just seem to kinda glide along as they seem to move faster than their animation looks like they should imo.   Balance. NOPE! Everything I can tell is that the game is heavily in favour of Eldar right now and Orkz are just kinda â¥â¥â¥â¥ on.   Microtransactions. Yep! Pay for a full priced game and then have microtransactions for gear that is better. This isn't p2w per se, but this just means that the new players (which will be the life blood of this game) will be at a disadvantage from the first match unless they pay on top of paying.  Performance, so, I ran pretty smoothly in early access and right now I've been running on lower settings with worse performance. In Early Access, I had been getting roughly 45+ fps on medium settings, right now on low I get &lt;30fps. Optimization, like most other features in the game, seems to have gone backwards in development.  That's not even to mention what was 'sold' originally and what the game has become. Right now, it isn't even the same game that was being sold originally, except by name alone. Tons of axed features with tons of disappointment.   On the whole, in about a year of development, this game MIGHT be a good game. However, right now, the game is kinda â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. It's a mediocre-at-best arena shooter right now that is just wasting space on my hard drive.   The biggest issue I think, however, is how I see this game developing from here. I highly doubt it'll recover. It has, atm, ~2700 players that will, most likely, abandon ship due to bugs/performance and such. This'll leave the game hemoragging players while the word gets out about the state of the game and THAT will lead to a spiral which the game won't be able to recover from. How do I make such profound and insane predictions? Simple, look at what happened to Evolve. Look at what happened to Battleborn. All three had the same/similar problems on launch and all three have/will have the same exact issues. Does anyone honestly expect Battleborn to recover? If not, why would Eternal Crusade recover?  So much potential, wasted on a rushed launch that will send the game into a spiral which it won't recover.
13858	As of now the mechanics are a bit off. Some of the assets seem sub-par and the game needs a lot of obvious bugs squished. PvE is in a BETA state at best. The games seems F2P ready. Maybe later if you are looking to buy, and this is coming from a fan of shooters and a fan of WH40k.  Seems rather negative. Here's four 'good' things about the game:  1. Melee combat reminds me of the Electric Slide.  2. When the ork players run in different directions and attack everything, including each other, it's the best role playing you'll see in a game.  3. Watching assault troops slide down a wall into a canyon.   4. Three or more melee players all rushing the guy behind the other guy, in a circle.
13859	Half finished game missing most of the promises made to backers.   It's a unifinished arena shooter.
13860	So many missing aspects that were promised to be ready for launch. Promised persistant world and currently works as a lobby shooter. Classes are in the game but clearly not finished or at least not to the depth they should be. The 1000's of weapons and customizations are just the reskins and all cost Rogue Trader points which you need to purchase for real money even after paying for the 'full' game.  As well the entire game is fairly buggy and unoptomized to the point that it seems pointless to play at times. Connection issues which are apparently from their end, hit detection issues, issues of aiming too close to objects/walls, sticking and not sticking to walls, issues with jumping over barriers. etc.   Could be a good game given a year or 2 of actually implementing these things but not currently worth the money waiting for failed promises.
13861	oh dear Warhammer 40,000 : Eternal Crusade where to start with this mess, i can't be stuffed.
13862	if they can fix the crash issues, then great game, since i can't even play this game as much as i would like to..   nope.   updated drivers still no go.
13863	:balanced:
13864	The game lags quite often, with the controls not being really fluid. The graphics art not spectacular but there not too horrible. Bought a copy for me and a friend, friend couldnt get his to work correctly. Overall not very happy with my purchase.
13865	This is like the time you gave Horus a tenner to hold whilst you look for something in your pocket.  When you look up and ask for it back......he goes.........................'What tenner?'   This is how I felt   This game sucks 
13866	 Early Access Review
13867	This game is heresy  Bought the game when it first came out on steam. I could understand that it was going to suck â¥â¥â¥ but right now the game still freaking sucks and it is full release.   Personally when i heard about this game and how it was a 40k mmo which had tyranids, orks, chaos, space marines and eldar in my mind i pictured that i could run around on a planet with friends or by myself and kill waves of tyranids and other enemies to get to my mission objective and have many moments of epicness. Sadly that is not the case.  What sucks: 1) the friends list: why is it that i can't just freaking join my friends when they are in a game, why is it that if i join a war party that if i touch anything it will screw up the war party, why is it that if the leader of the war party clicks the cancel match it doesn't do it for everyone  2) why third person: it makes the game freaking annoying to play, i play hive mode and it is freaking impossible to play because of how close quarters it is  3) why is it that when i unload an entire clip point (until it over heats or close to) blank range of a devestator (a heavy weapon) that my opponent doesn't die or kills me first then he dies. But when i go up against an opponent with a devestator it takes all of 2 seconds for them to kill me.  4) when i bought this game i was told MMO however this is so far from an mmo that it isn't funny. This is simply an online shooter not a game where you go do missions or quests, go explore the world, ride around on kick â¥â¥â¥ vehicles and rain down fire on the tyranids.   5) many other things  In a scoreing system of 1 - 10, 1 being the lowest 10 being the highest i would give this a 5/10, just incredibly boring to play however there are times where you will have great fun they're just not often enough.     
13868	This Game is bad, and it will make you feel bad when you play it. Much like bouts of diarrhea, you'll get washed over with nostalgia of the Warhammer 40k world. You'll get to do things like run around as a Space Marine, doing Space Marine things on giant, terribly difficult to navigate levels which feel like they were designed by a blind person.  You're a genetically engineered super human with three lungs, two hearts and have the emperor's blood pumping through your veins. You drop in with your team, (4 bad asses much like yourself) and run across the battlefield and you start shooting at the enemy with your trusty Bolter, from what would easily be 18' to 24' on the table top. All of a sudden, the [other race, especially Eldar] close the gap in less than 2 seconds and start bashing your head in. You die. Then get executed, cause you can add insult to injury in this game.  You think alright, well, maybe I got unlucky, I'll try being a Hand to Hand guy. Then you get spanked time over time over time by the same guy, who killed and executed you before.   You switch back to your bolter, cause F that noise, and finally, you encounter a target you should beat no problem. An Ork shooting a rifle from the distance. You raise your trusty bolter, and exchange fire. You quickly find out that an Ork wearing leather tidbits, is more accurate, takes more damage, deals more damage than you, and you get cut down where you stand.   I thought I was a Space Marine. Humanities finest, strongest, greatest creation. I'm one of the Emperor's Finest, and I got spanked by some ork shooting some 'dakka' gun from the distance? I turned off the game and uninstalled it. I've been playing since alpha, and if you're a WH40k fan like me, don't play this game.  Please don't give Games Workshop anymore money. Buying this game gives GW an excuse to pump out more trash onto the market, like that Mordheim game. The Bloodbowl franchise. All those Space Hulk games. Don't forget that Total War game. God knows, if they actually get desperate enough they might release a decent game that actually represents the table top accurately. I'm waiting Games Workshop. You can even sell me 10 imaginary Space Marines for a buck and I'll pay for it. Sell me an imaginary land raider for like $3.50.  Remember having fun playing Monopoly on a computer? Imagine how much fun it'd be playing a Table Top version of Warhammer 40k on a computer. Well, this game isn't that. Please do yourself, me, and other fans a favor, and don't buy this game.
13869	Was promised a open world MMOTPS, got a bad copy of Space Marine with the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥iest customization ever and the steepest prices. 10 â¬ for a â¥â¥â¥â¥in helmet?!
13870	To summarize the entire development of Warhammer 40,000: Eternal Crusade: Broken promises and shattered dreams.  I was watching the MMO by Vigil Games. I am a founding captain of this game. I paid $120 to support development, because I wanted to see the game that they said that they were making. I have been here since the beginning. Many fanboys of a title will bash reviews that point out broken promises by making the statement that since we are not developers, we do not understand the development process, so our review is pointless. Not so here. I am a game developer hobbyist. I make games for friends and family to play, and I am developing a commercial title. You could easily make the backbone of the game that was promised in the Unity engine, using assets bought on the Unity asset store, within a few months, by yourself, as a lone developer. I would not be surprised to see this game's assets for sale on the UE4 asset store within the year as Behavior Interactive attempts to grab up more money to offset this travesty. I have $30 in credit there, I'll keep my eyes open, and perhaps show them how it should have been done.  Honestly, what have they been doing at Behavior Interactive? Their newsletters look busy busy busy, they say they're busy busy busy, what they said in dev streams sounded busy busy busy, but what they showed us is lazy lazy lazy. Everything that I see presented to us, shows us an abuse of fandom, more time spent leading people by the nose, than actually delivering on it. Perhaps they shouldn't have been serving alcohol during development, because somewhere along the line, people got confused at what they were doing. Perhaps being a bit tipsy, and trying to code blueprints, model, retopoligize, implement, bug squash, balance, etc... etc... was not the greatest idea in the world.  We were promised open world. We are denied. We were promised intense tyrannid incursions we had to fight off. We are denied. We were promised rabid hordes of orks simulated by free to play. We are denied. We were promised jaw dropping character customization. We are denied. We were promised chaos would not be reskinned space marines. We are denied. We were promised... We were promised... We were promised...  We are denied.  This doesn't even start to cover the failures as a lobby shooter. Read other reviews for that. I don't play this game, as the game that I paid for, was never even developed.  I will never again even begin to consider purchasing a game with Behavior Interactive even remotely attached to it.
13871	the game is unifnished.   once more, a game rolls out of early access that clearly shouldnt. and that is ignoring the fact that the game MASSIVELY undedelivers what the devs promised. even besides from that it has horrible netcode issues, is awfully optimized, still has low quality, placeholder looking assets...  the biggest problem I see with this is that with this absolutely botched launch it will never gain the playerbase it would need in order to be playbale properly once the problems might be ironed out. that being, if they ever will be. this might end up being a tragic 40k stillborn...  a shame.
13872	Very unbalanced game, worth maybe 15 eu but 50? if you feel like screwing youself over majorly i wouldn't recommend buying this game. and if you do, be ready for the most unbalanced pvp game you've -ever- seen. Currently Eldar is the most overpowered fanction loosing 1/10 games and thats if they feel like being gentle and giving you the win.
13873	Ok, so I bought this because I'm a WH fanboy. I have the Dawn of War games, bought Space marine on pc and xbox, and.....I loved them. They have their flaws, space marine didn't feel complete and a bit like a gears of war game but still, i loved it. I love the multiplayer of it the most, and when I saw this, I thought 'WH40K MMO SWEET'. Then it dropped from being a true mmo-rpg to an mmo shooter of sorts. I heard it was like Battlefield so I bought it. Because I love battlefield and WH.   I really want to love this game, I mean it. I really really do. But I've never written a review on steam and I'm going to for this one. I'm doing it because I love WH so much, and I have to agree with so many people that this is a let down to the genre, the community and the franchise.   I haven't played it for very long but it doesn't take long to see bugs and problems. It feels like a beta, a very early stage beta. I had bugs where my guy went invisible, and my team mates couldn't see me, aiming and looking around didn't work. But it's so unstable. Unit collision is horrible and the way everything interacts doesn't feel completed. The fact there is advertising for 1,000s of items is so obscenely false it's almost criminal. You don't have nearly the customization you think you would be able to, and for what there is, you have to buy it with real money, after buying the game.  The game doesn't feel balanced at all either and the objective fights on the large maps quickly turn into a grab bag of who can drop their apc outside first. You spawn on the apc and just keep running in, with no care about dying because it's a time limit. The one game mode where there is a death counter seems to be for only the defenders, and the lives they get for the time they have to stay alive is absurd and next to impossible. Certain factions and groups don't make sense in they can hurt so bad and take so much damage, and it's this early into the game.   I also don't think the game is explained well at all. The so called 'tutorial area' is nothing more than a premade map where you run around and activate tooltips to get a small, single sentence tip about what you can do. It isn't very well made, and doesn't help explain the mechanics of the whole game enough.   That being said, I can see potential in the game. They need more items, armor, relics, trinkets, etc. They also need more rewards for team fighting more, and dealing with objectives strategically, more than just horde style. I like the idea of the veteran classes and I think a more fanboy approach to the game could help it a bit. The ones who love the game love the lore, so have there be special unlocks, faction specific items, weapons, armor, vehicls etc. and have them be able to have a uniqueness, kind of like loot, to the game to make people want to 'grind' and play them. There also obviously needs to be more people in the game, because it feels too small for what there is, but bringing in more content for free will help that. I think Guild Wars is a good example that did it well for a single price for a full game. I get the small transactions to an extent, that's the name of gaming right now so it's hard to avoid the band wagon, but at least provide the players with something they want to spend their money on, not stuff they feel like they should already have.  I know some people are going to defend it, and I'm not saying it doesn't have the potential to be a good game amongst the masses and a great game for the fanboys, but I just feel it's unfair right now to say it's a release version, given the state of it at the moment. I hope the updates come soon and I just want a more stable game at minimum. With all the time and money spent, I feel like it could've been done better before being 'released'.
13874	Horrible Customer Support!  Game wont even load when it hits 100%.  Gave the devs the error code twice and no feedback... Poor Poor Poor
13875	A really poor executed game. You can know whats is wrong in this game from the other reviews,because there is nothing else to add. a waste of 150 euros founder pack
13876	This is not what was advertised. In game pay to win items. Similar to Evolve in the pay to win/pay to play aspect.
13877	Not worth buying. Developers promised lots of things few years back. Almost none of those promises were fullfilled. This rotting corpse that they call Eternal Crusade is not worth your time. Invest your money somewhere else.   Or if you want to know more about Warhammer 40k I'd say download some codexes and read them.
13878	Much was promised, little was actually delivered. Another testament to why Early Acsess can make or in this case, break, a title.
13879	I'm going to keep this short.  Game graphics are nice, smooth play, but the game us still HUGELY lacking and is not worth the 60 dollars CAD new, not to mention the low player count in game can leave yea sitting for a good 10 minutes in que so play a faction thats not space marine.  Wait for it to go on a big sale then pick it up. The game has only changed hands 3 or 4 times, I dont wanna know how many head Dev;s were changed too.
13880	Â£85 totaly wasted on captin founders pack. please see Wiawyr's review, explains perfectly.  #heartbroken
13881	The game is bad, high ping, unbalanced, eldar just jump around, they are faster than bullets like teleporting fast, not just agility, frames jump with images of eldars and their hit box is so small even at close range you can't shoot them, their weapons are faster, and hit the same damage. If you hit them is because they didn't move at all or fell into a grenade. Realy wanted to like this, but is realy badly executed. Animations are cluncky, sound efects are like 1 channel, you can only hear one thing at a time and there is no ambient background sound that makes you feel in the battle, is just a bunch of bullet sound effects. Tanks are like wooden boxes, they dont feel heavy and when they feel heavy they don't even move, like there is a bug in movement at times. The game is not worth a full price as it is, the equipment menu is bad, you have to double click things to unequip or equip and you don't know if you can even do it, no tooltips on items. don't buy it at full price or don't even buy it at all, is a waste of time and money.
13882	This game needs alot of work. Developer is great, always updating the game and trying to polish it. But the developer i feel like pressured them to get it out too early. Still alot of balance issues with races or weapons. I have a feeling once they add everything that was promised over time it will be a great game. At the current price and for the content included at the moment there is no way i could recommend this game to even my greatest enemy. If you love WH40k and want to support what will end up being a great game in the future, then by all means. But you should know what you're getting yourself into from the start.
13883	Not worth playing even if f2p
13884	Since Friday Launch, haven't been able to play a match/game/round since it is taking forever to load up a match. So it is very hard to enjoy a game, when one can't even play it...  Edit: No Longer takes forever for me it seems. Now just wish ticket count for the siege was higher and that capturing Point A didn't give 10 more minutes...
13885	Was promised a open world MMOTPS, got a bad copy of Space Marine with the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥iest customization ever and the steepest prices. 10 â¬ for a â¥â¥â¥â¥in helmet?!

13887	Runs really poorly.
13888	Not the greatest launch, as one of the founder pack owners for this game, I am highly let down because of the lack of content. This game had so much going for it and now it could be lost.
13889	Yeah, it's gonna be a nope from me. I mean wtf, then the game is stable and fun - then you go ahead and completely screw the game sideways. And then repeat the cycle. Fun - Not fun - Fun - Not fun - Fun - Not fun. It's more unstable than a teenage girl. â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
13890	The game is in a decent Beta-state. But, frankly, I'm amazed they're 'releasing' it in this state, not to mention a full $60 price tag. Caveat Emptor.
13891	So, I made the unfortunately choice to be one of the backers. I say unfortunate, cause when I backed this, the game was planned to be different than it is now. Back then, it was going to be so much better. Free to play was going to be ork boyz only, which was ingenious. Use the chaotic nature of all the random free to play people to accurately represent the orks? Awesome. And it felt like it was going to aim towards Planetside 2 esque feel maybe. You could even see some of the things they were going for in the game still (looking at the vehicles).  But something changed, they made it another Battlefield or such, with a slightly meh PvE mode. The worst part? There's no balance to the game... well... there is but there isn't. Marines and Chaos Marines are nigh exactly the same and the orks... kinda feel same-y too. Eldar are different but then it doesn't matter. The big reason there's no balance? Everyone's playing Marines so you have Marines against whatever you choose to play if you aren't one. And there's always more Marines.   An example - Played earlier after launch... made an ork. Took a moment to try to customize things (then when I got into a match they only let me use the presets). Got into the game, launched in... and hit tab to see the Marines we were up against had at least six more players. And then we got stomped cause numbers and all the clanners that were on Marines even leading up to this. Makes playing non-Marines just not fun.  So all in all, if it hits a good sale, maybe get it. If you are going to be a marine and want to just get a self-inflated ego by how 'awesome' you are, go ahead. If they actually buckle down and go 'man we really need to work on our netcode, matchmaking, and maybe try to get closer to our original vision' then maybe.  But I unfortunately cannot recommend it right now.  EDIT - 12/16/16 More updates and I have played more of it. Still seems to be a lack of players for anything but marines, meaning you get X faction vs Marines, but they seem better balanced in numbers in those matches now. Since you need to play the game to unlock stuff to equip on custom classes, you're stuck with the presets. They're not bad, actually, but good luck against a tank.  Still, I feel oddly pulled into the game more now and I don't know why. There are a few things that feel different between factions now (â¥â¥â¥â¥in chaos sorcerers), but still a lot of 'samey' feelings.  So updating my review, for now, to get it on sale.
13892	First of this game is not ready for release by far. And i backed the game for 80$..  - The Controls are clunky and unresponsive, for everything..  - TTK is extremely fast, you will die a lot and not knowing what killed you..  - Weapon balance broken, some weapons and classes are WAY better than other..  - There are NO open world, as originally promised. (The game is just an Arena shooter)  - Numerous bugs: Vehicles spawn without turrets, You can get stuck in certain spawns, Random disconects, Lag..laggy lag.. And a lot more..  - Borderline Pay-to-win..
13893	I can only make a recommendation based on a quick look at the game, but it turned me off and there's nothing about it that I want to spend more time with. If you want to smugly pown noobs, you probably will like it. The gameplay, the controls, the 3rd person aiming, the balancing, the scenarios...everything turned me off.   First impressions are what make these arena type games thrive of die. This one was brutal.   
13894	DO NOT BUY UNTIL ON SALE.    I was promised Space Marine the MMO. Instead we got 30 FPS graphics in choppy, player based servers that're barely playable. Game gave me a sense of regret for pre-order/backing in ways that you didn't think possible. The kill team portion is boring, unbalanced and just unfun. Last time I was this dissapointed it was High Moon's last transformers game but Eternal Crusade really lowers the bar for how awful developer promises can become.
13895	This game was promised to be an MMO kind of like planetside. That is why i bought this game. Not so that i could recieve a very crappy team based shooter in the 40k universe. I loved the concept. The idea of massive battles was amazing...but now they decided to cheat us all out of what we were supposed to get.
13896	I can't believe I spent $60 on this garbage game.  How did they ever get a Games Workshop license? They just patched and it's still a horrible game. I keep trying to play it, and every time I log out â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. How is this even a shooter in 2016? Vehicles are completely undriveable. Netcode is a laggy mess. Nothing like the planetside2 which was a comparison selling point for me. As expected, everyone is playing Space Marine so get used to getting decapitated by them. Non-random gameplay modes look like this: Players in Queue: Space Marines 33, Chaos Marines 1, Orks 0, Eldar 0 Dated graphics even on max settings. Chaos marines get a flamethrower that demolishes vehicles in 4 seconds flat... Not sure there is a balance team behind this. Just don't buy it. Don't do it. Save yourself the trouble. The netcode is terrible.  I don't write reviews, but every time I play this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥, I want to come here and expand on my vitriol. No Man's Sky is a better multi-player game than this...  Update -- still a wreck. Still bad netcode where you get instagibbed by dudes with chainswords.
13897	Didnt deliver on what was promised. Bad launch. Lots on rl cash for in game currency. Just a sad end to overly large promises. I wish I had Dark Millennium instead of this mess.
13898	Terrible, pathetic, inexcusable. Not an ounce of fun in this no matter how much you enjoy WH40K. Optimisation practically not to be found, so terrible performance while still looking and sounding outdated. Shooter and cover mechanics are years behind of even PC third person shooters. A terrible waste of a license and a huge disservice to the franchise.  Stay away from this.
13899	I really wanted to make my Space Marine look badass, the customisation is taking too long to keep me interested. The devs are too busy reskinning a new weapon.
13900	It is not an MMO! its a lobbyshooter! its a fullrpice game, yet any cosmetic stuff cost 2-10 bucks, for EACH peace of armor (6 peaces, you make your math) random lootboxes give you crap you allready have from the start (and no it does not look different) balance is very bad performance is poor  even if you are a die-hard 40k fan, by the Emperor DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!
13901	The game is in a decent Beta-state. But, frankly, I'm amazed they're 'releasing' it in this state, not to mention a full $60 price tag. Caveat Emptor.
13902	I can only make a recommendation based on a quick look at the game, but it turned me off and there's nothing about it that I want to spend more time with. If you want to smugly pown noobs, you probably will like it. The gameplay, the controls, the 3rd person aiming, the balancing, the scenarios...everything turned me off.   First impressions are what make these arena type games thrive of die. This one was brutal.   
13903	So, I made the unfortunately choice to be one of the backers. I say unfortunate, cause when I backed this, the game was planned to be different than it is now.

13904	Don't bother, old Space Marine was better and probably still is. Buggy, laggy, missing tons of content that was promised at launch.
13905	This game is broken and un-balanced. They released it early and they should not have done that. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. It has less that 500 players a day. I wish i could get a refund.
