I could finish my first battle - was killed because the game lagging. When I start to play I found that this game looks similar to Metro, Stalker...  Going to return. Don't need this.
636	0	a	While the gameplay is fun, there just isn't enough of it. There are far too many cutscenes in this game.
1453	0	a	I was expecting so much more from this game... It is a real shame.  First off, the performance is very â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥... FPS drops, but a patch is coming for that. Though im sure that patch won't fix the fact that I can run every other game on high settings, but this, I have to run on low settings and even lower the resolution below my native! Sigh.  Secondly, thinking the COOP would be cool? Nope, very small and limited mission based scenario's... It would have been so much better if we were able to free roam in the campaign world...  Unfortunately this game has bombed hard and won't recover from this, I highly doubt many people will still be playing within the next couple of weeks, which is a shame because no one wanted this game to succeed more than I did.... :(  Save your money, only buy if on sale for an EXTREMELY CHEAP price.

609	0	a	It starts out pretty well but quickly turns into the kind of adventure game where you need to keep the walktrhough open in the Steam browser as murder plans become more and more convoluted. Moderately entertaining if you find the premise entertaining but ultimately very flawed - particularly in terms on pacing and escalation.

281	1	a	definetly one of my favorites games, Lucius, scary game, lots of blood every where and maybe the best feeling to play in the night, i must admit that the game is pretty hard. I've rarely seen a game that embraces the bad guy as thoroughly and wholeheartedly as Lucius does. There's no hesitation, no complex explanations, no hedging of moral bets, or offering a suggestion that the game's victims kind of had it coming. In the game's opening minutes, the player is asked to lock a maid inside a walk-in freezer overnight, for no other reason than because the devil tells them to do it.Lucius is a singularly bleak and nasty experience, its only 'redeeming' characteristic being the utter straightforwardness with which it treats its darker subject matter. Not only does the game refuse to shy away from depicting the horrifically violent, it lavishes attention on the atrocities, showing them in slow motion from dramatic camera angles.

1083	1	a	So I'm not one to play games with a linear storyline from beginning to end. But Lucius was one of those games, though could use some work, had me entertained throuhgout... I mean how often can you play the son of the devil and go around killing people?   I do recommend this game and even though it's not a huge game it's still very enjoyable.  I did a full playthrough of the game, just in case you get stuck at some points. Here's the first episode to taste what the game has in store for you.   https://youtu.be/yeizmSoOvsM

364	1	a	Lucius is a funny little game with a great concept. Both the visuals and voice acting are surprisingly good for this kind of game. The story and characters are alright and it is beyond charming riding around a tricycle in your fathers mansion plotting a sinister murder. The execution isn't perfect though. The point and click adventure style part of the game works for the most time alright however there are some far fetched puzzles and some annoying item searching in there. There are also some stealth missions in the game which would work surprisingly fine if the game didnt restart the entire map every time you got caught. This dumb save-system drags down every single part of the game but it is especially noticeable in the stealth missions. There are also some action-based missions in the game which are quite awful. I would still recommend the game to anyone interested despite its flaws simply because its concept is so unique and entertaining. So if you find this game available for a cheap price, go for it! It will be an interesting experience no matter what !!!

787	1	a	I loved this game since I saw a youtuber play it and just had to play it myself. the only small problem I had was figuring out what to do at times
2817	1	a	Probably the best game i have ever played in my life, or TOP 3 material. This game is something superb, i fell tottaly in love with it. It did have great music, story, characters...WOW. On the other hand, the technical aspect of the game is really TERRIBLE, and i am not talking about minor problems, it is really badly done, really. I was lauhing at it first, but my friend really pushed me to play it, and now, after finishing it, i can say, that that was one of the best things i ever played, if not the best. (and i played Fallout, Planescape torment and almost all legends made). This game just was really special.

361	1	a	If you like puzzle games and you wanna be the bad guy for once, get that game ! I really enjoyed it and I strongly recommend it. Although it's a little bit short (6 hours for me), it's totally worth it to get it, at least on sale if not for the full price. Enjoy being mean...
2692	1	a	You play as FBI agent Fancis York Morgan, a delusional man that gets crime clues from his coffee, and talks to his 'imaginary' friend Zach, more than he talks to real people, in front of real people. He's sent to Twin Peaks (can't remember the name of the town, and its twin peaks anyways) to investigate a murder case that seems relate to a killer he's been investigating for some time.  The game is a collision of genres and elements that tries to be so many things at the same times, but really doesnt have the budget or technical prowess to truly be the game it could be...That being said, I enjoyed this game a lot, from its strange characters, that by the end make York look like a normal guy, to the sandbox exploration elements in a nearly lifeless massive town that brings to the table, for no good reason, like everything else in this game, and still works.   This game is a...Sandbox Survival Horror Simulator Adventure Third Person Shooter Fishing Exploration Game with day and night cycles where all characters have their daily routine...What the hell did I just say? And the game totally half asses most of those genres.  A technical disaster that manages to be one of the most unique, funny, weird and all around insane games, Isn't that right, Zach?  I Love it

768	1	a	Lucius may have itâs flaws, yes. The graphics and the voicework needed more work. The gameplay can get boring after some time and doesnât leave a lot of room for your own choice but all in all I actually felt like an evil little boy. I actually felt like I was playing the game of The Omen and I had a lot of fun in the process of killing my new virtual family. So if you are a little sadistic like me and liked The Omen and games like Manhunt, Lucius is definitly worth picking up.
2994	1	a	If you're like me, you'll walk into this game blind. You'll have to fight with technical issues and endure some unpolished gameplay. If you're like me, you'll find yourself loving the characters so much that whatever issues the game has takes a back seat to the experience and you'll want to know what happens next.

End of Chap. 2 when practicing Telekinesis, the cardboard box doesn't even spawn to put the car in. Restarted multiple times. Replayed both chapters multiple times. Redownloaded once. Even left it running for 30min at the bug for the hell of it. -Peace out Dante Manor-
2288	0	a	Only got this because im from philly and thats really the only selling point for this whole game.
1971	1	a	First, the game isn't as buggy as people claim. It's a Cryengine game, all you need to do is not play it at max settings and suddenly the game works perfectly fine. Know the limitations of your own system.  Second, this is not a sequel to Homefront. It doesn't have any connection to it besides 'North Korea is the bad guy', and 'There's a tank called the Goliath'. If you're especting the crap from Homefront or some oddball story, don't. They're not related.   With that said, this is a good game, one of few games I recommend. Beyond the usual positives and negatives with the Cryengine, between it looking detailed and well designed, Homefront The Revolution has the good gameplay of Crysis 3 with the simple design of Farcry 3. If you liked the landscape of Crysis 3, or liked the open combat of Farcry 3 and 4, you'll like this game. Half the game is going from base to base capturing them, and running into the odd patrol, or having multiple ways of doing the same thing. The story is kinda eh, but so is the story of all open world games.  What really shines is the other half of the game, where you're in 'yellow zones', making it really feel like the world is believable. You can't just walk into a yellow zone, that is residental areas in the Philly turned Bagdad, and gun down everything in sight with no consequences. You open fire, suddenly you have 3 humvees on you and 50 guys on you. You kill a civilian, people react and get â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. More than that, not every problem is solved with killing either. Some cases it's better and easier to distract soldiers away from whatever they might be harrassing than you flat kill them. While it's not a terribly deep game, it's more realistic than the majority of games you'll run into on the market, not just story wise, but gameplay wise.   It also has multiplayer, which I will say is good on it's own. They're effectively stand-alone missions with friends, with a progression/RPG system tacked on to give it more content. The amount of content is enough for me to say it's like a DLC expansion given to you by default; Extended missions, with a second character/mechanics system, with friends. That said, because of the bad rap the game's gotten, there's not a lot of people playing the multiplayer. It really does shine when you have other people obviously, but with some smart playing and decent skill you can play alone. Again, think of it as extra, standalone missions  All that said, it does have bugs. It's open world, it's bound to have bugs. Besides the usual Cryengine garbage, some geometry will trap you, NPCs might sink into the ground sporaticly, and enemies can spawn in impossible places. Beyond that, this is one of the least buggy open-world games I've played. Between FO4 and FC3/4, this game is very solid. Again, if you're having issues, turn down the settings, it's the Cryengine.   Oh, and if all that's not enough, you get a second free game added in, albeit and old game :P

1132	1	a	8/10. This was a hoot and a half. Surprisingly difficult in parts, too. A TON of cut scenes, but the fact that you're playing the evil character somewhat makes up for it. I do recommend it, but be prepared for those cut scenes!  Pros: -Story -Puzzles -Someone has done walkthroughs  Cons: -Too many cut scenes
705	0	a	Don't touch this game, unless it's a few bucks. It has some bad optimzation issues, boring/tedious gameplay that just isn't fun. It's a unique game, but there isn't much there to warrant a play-through.
2388	1	a	  Not a bad FPS and while I dont intend on buying it after the free weekend, I would recommend it if it stays in the 20 dollar price range as there seems to be plenty of content in the base game.  Gameplay-wise, it starts off a bit chaotic after the overly long opening scene with tons of radio chatter and calls for help lighting up the HUD so much, I would suggest disabling most of the prompts for not only immersion but also an enjoyable less intrusive experience.  The game looks great and there is no doubt an improvement from the 1st title and it also plays very smoothly on modest hardware so you should be able to find your system sweet spot with a tweak here and there.

1345	1	a	 Bottom line:  An enjoyable and attractive, if somewhat frustrating, top-down driving game in the vein of the original GTA games. Has less complex missions, however spices things up with seriously large hordes of zombies to brutalise with heavy weapons!   Pros:    Video and audio are generally pleasing. The maps and vehicles have a lot of gritty detail and weather and lighting effects are put to good use. The particle and gore effects are suitably over-the-top and make firing rockets into zombie mobs a very satisfying experience.   Multiple game modes provide a great amount of content for the price and also offer a variety of experiences. This is a good thing, because the story missions generally feel much the same. In particular, I found the Slaughter mode (arena) to be challenging and required both tactical and strategic thinking to reach round 20 and beyond. Racing includes a variety of different events, in which the aim is either racing, destroying opponents, or driving as far as possible with a bomb attached to your car! Sadly, I found all modes spoiled more often that not by the difficulty in identifying 'hard' obstacles and the unpredictable handling of the vehicles during collisions.   Weapon variety is decent and effective, but fairly uninspired. Power-ups are all incremental improvements until the last level, where power is doubled. Specialisation usually plays second fiddle to whatever happens to be lying around your general vicinity at the time.   No crashes in the ten or so hours spent in game (Windows 8).    Cons:    Unpredictable behaviour when hitting walls and other obstructions; sometimes you bounce, sometimes you stop dead, sometimes you instantly spin 180 degrees. A little frustrating in the main game, immensely frustrating in the race events! Came close to rage quitting a few times in this mode... Apart from this, the controls are fine (used M&amp;KB).   What 'story' there is remains utterly predictable throughout and voice acting is excruciating. I am sure its tongue in cheek, but its still horrible.   Performance drops and wavers noticeably once there are a  lot  of zombies on the screen. This is mainly an issue in arena mode, where huge hordes are a common occurence. This is on an i5 3570K with an AMD 6950.     DLC:    Mostly forgettable...   The included vehicles are overpowered and spoil the progression of the story mode a little.   If you are still looking for more of the same  after  completing the game, you won't be disappointed with the additional race and arena maps. If you are expecting something different, don't bother.

2078	1	a	Take note that I have not come across any game breaking buigs yett nor many FPS issues like some. Gameplay wise, the game feels great! Its a Far Cry mixed with CoD feel. I love Far Cry and I like the fast paced gunplay that CoD brings to this game. Also, the gun customization is amazing! Feels great and is a lot of fun to make different combos with the weapons! This game is a solid 7/10 for me! With some patches maybe even higher! Still waiting on the Day 1 patch though!

53	1	a	I remember this back when it first came out, was supposed to be a 'League of Legends' killer  Unfortunatly they didnt realize how insanly popular LoL would become, thus totally dwarfing this game completly and throwing it into the corner of obscurity.  This game was Gifted to me by a friend and I have to say its a fun game for that style of gameplay.   This game however lacks characters... there are only two types... Tank/Healers and Assassin/Carry's. That is coupled with the fact there are only 8 choosable characters to play (+2 grey'ed out unchoosables... a DLC that didnt happen?) making gameplay a tad repetitive in the long run.  If you decide to pick this game up though be warned, there is no Online community for it anymore... pick it up knowing you will only be playing A.I. Bots solo  but for 2.50 (the sale price) its totally worth it as a great casual hour killing game. if you want to play this style of game Seriously though pick up League of Legends or DoTA2 (they are both free) they have huge communities and 'MLG' tournaments  7/10
1024	1	a	Have you ever seen the movie Omen? No? Me neither, but I'm sure you're familiar with the trope of the eerie creepy son of Satan character arc that can be portrayed in some of Hollywood's most frightening films. Now, instead of playing the hero one would think they would be, you play as LUCIUS the hell spawn himself and roam about innocently your parents manor, using your new found powers to end the miserable lives of all who reside there.  The game itself has a wonderful concept, BECOME the horror, and while it may sometimes be delivered poorly due to some level breaking bug or the fact that you're spotted once and then you have to start ALL over again I still think it accomplishes what it sets out to do.  Now, this isn't a action game, sort of. There are parts that heavily rely on action, but the majority of the game is spent in the puzzle world. Think of it like Hitman and your run of the mill puzzle game clash heads. Safe to say, I definitely enjoyed the puzzles (IE Murders) a lot more, action was too clunky and felt like it was tacked on.  Anyways 7/10 Would try again.
1983	1	a	Pay attention if you ARE THINKING to buy this game or not, so many people were crying about the optimization of the game, i can clearly tell you that they are playing it with PC's older than their grandparents's parents the optimization is perfect playing with 70 fps, sometimes drops to 55-60 but only for few seconds. So that's it for the optimization. The vehicle physics are cool, the feature that you can upgrade your weapons and attach everything on it. Also if you don't know the multiplayer experience is awesome, and it's fun with friends. So please don't look at the fake negative reviews and buy this, it's worth the money.

1306	1	a	amusing zombie game, driving the car over the bodies feels like the old days playing GTA3. the animations are pretty similar.  the story mode is fine, there is also an arena and racing mode, many different perks, weapons and unlockable cars.  enough enemy types and simple controls round the package.  only bad points are the low quality sound and that its singleplayer only.  all together its sure worth the 8,99â¬ and fun if you like crunching some zombies!
2164	1	a	I bought this with pretty low expectations, and those expectations were met. It's not especially polished, no. It could use a LOT of work. But it has a lot of heart, and what is there is fun. It's a bit of a hot mess, but if you can put up with the occasional technical issue (of which there are many), this is worth a try.

49	0	a	It removes one of the worst conventions of MOBAs, last-hitting, but provides such a bare-bones experience that it will only entertain you for a short time before you've seen all there is to see. Worse still, Stardock has labeled the project a failure, and there will be no more work done on the game. If you want to play a MOBA, but you hate last-hitting, try Heroes of the Storm. I hear it is more of a Hero brawler, and less of a MOBA, but it is probably a better use of your money.  I'll admit I enjoyed the game, when I still felt motivated to play it, and I got it for a whole $2, so I suppose I got a good value. However, I also got Sacred Gold (on  gog.com , mind) for the same price, and will continue to get value out of that that will far exceed this title, just to put things in perspective.
1768	0	a	Was actually really keen to play and like this but despite the good graphics and cool idea, it has frame rate issues. Interiors were alright but as soon as i went outside it started chugging. im running a GTX970, 16gb ram, i7 2600 and even on Medium settings it had low FPS on exterior scenes. Apparently this is pretty common place with this game.

2843	1	a	Twin Peaks gone Silent Hill, as realized by a Japanese dev team on LSD. There are plenty of flaws, even discounting the terrible porting job, but underneath it all is an awkwardly endearing and clearly ambitious hodgepodge of a game. The writing is occasionally quite clever and humorous, the characters grow on you and are surprisingly multidimensional. The story, while full of plot holes, is still interesting enough that it kept me going. And while it's usually easy to guess what happens next in the grand scheme of things, the details are usually completely unexpected. Especially when it comes to dialogue.  It's easy to see why everyone won't give this one a chance though. Production quality varies heavily. Many environments are incredibly detailed, characters are mostly well modeled, and voice acting is at least bearable and often genuinely decent. On the other hand character animations are often awful and level design is mostly uninspired and occasionally very annoying. This goes double for the corridors you end up traversing when the game switches to otherworld mode. There are occasional environmental puzzles that have no particular reason to be there. They're always easy but also almost always annoying.   Combat is trivial, at least when played with a mouse, so the Silent Hilly otherworld bits where you shoot your way through endless mobs turn into routine that you have to turn your brain off for to get to the story bit on the other side. It's not actively terrible but you get the feeling the otherworld fighting stuff was meant for some other game entirely. But then, that goes for many things in the game. There are also useless combat-related QTEs which range from irritating to really bloody annoying, depending on whether you see them coming and whether you remember which buttons you need to press in which order to avoid being instakilled by one of the baddies that haunt your persistently through the game.  The freeroam stuff, while novel, also doesn't work too well as there isn't much of interest to actually do. The things you can do are also usually pointless from a gameplay perspective. Unless you really like increasing your Agent Honor by driving over medals in forest corridors, that is. Driving in general is something you will spend a lot of time doing, and you will not enjoy it.  Thankfully the devs realized driving around is boring (unless you play with a keyboard and mouse, then it's a constant life and death struggle to just stay on the road) and recorded tons of monologues where the main character reminisces about pop culture with his invisible friend. These give the driving segments a lighter tone and also help deepen the player character. Unfortunately the devs didn't consider how aggravating it is to listen to one single repetitively terrible cop show theme whenever your character doesn't happen to be talking about 80s B-movie rentals. A car radio would have been an amazing addition, even just so you could turn it off.  The music in general deserves a few comments. The number of tracks is way too low and many scenes have incredibly ill fitting tunes. Some of it is probably intentional humor, but it's impossible to tell. However some of the tracks are genuinely very good. Everything gets repetitive real quick though. You always know what sort of scene is about to start when you hear the music start to play. Well, except for that one experimental jazzy tune which is used completely randomly.  Basically, if you can enjoy diamond-in-the-rough style games, and find amusement in weird things both intentional and unintentional, and enjoyed the general atmosphere of Twin Peaks, this may be a game for you. Or not. The divisive reputation is certainly well deserved as even though I've spent quite a number of hours in it, it's still hard to recommend the game to anyone that isn't me.

1650	1	a	Just a quick comment regarding the co op mode - there are not many players around playing public mode much. Only a certain times a day, few familiar names pop up to play, but the rest of the times it is not possible to level up the character as there are no players playing the mode at all. Either most play the private co op mode, or there is no multiplayer community worth mentioning as such... just a few stragglers like me trying to play the game.  Personally I think that the game doesn't have enough co op missions to go through, gets very repeatitive after two hours when all has been seen and done. Difficulty levels add some different spawns and many mission waypoint locations, but many times the players will learn it all and no single spawning of an enemy comes as a surprise. So we would like to have more missions in the already large maps the game has, and some randomization in the mission waypoints where a base or listening post can be found.  I was also wondering if there is a possiblity to have more character slots? Since there is no respec option, those four slots will be used up in a Â½ - 1 week. Come to think of it, the char slots would be used up in a 2-3 days if the multiplayer community would be available most of the time, since co op missions require other players. For truly active players who have the time in their hands, those four slots might be filled in a day with max xp characters. So give us more char slots, please.

The story and dialog are top notch and even 30 hours in there's more and more to discover all the while getting engrossed in the setting of a medieval but fantasical Europe. Orcs and lizard-men roam the countryside while satanic plots threaten to destroy humanity but a familiar Christian dogma attempts to keep everything in check. The music is also very well done and quite fitting with an amazing variety where you're sure to keep hearing new tracks when coming across new dungeons.  If you have yet to be baptised to the faith of older top down RPGs you may find the combat and skill system a little out of date and you'd be right to think so. Still, once you get your first party member and learn the nuances of the skills and spells you'll be able to completely focus yourself on the games strong points. For just 10 dollars (or less, sale depending) you're more than likely to get your monies worth.

The negative side that I see is the enemy is sometime not very smart &amp; the story is rather dull. Other than that I really like this game, the game is like Far Cry 3/4 but in town.

1594	1	a	If you like Far Cry style games, where you are in an open area and have to take over outposts, you will probably like this game. With the gun play and gadgets in the game, this was where the main fun was for me in this game. However, I found the set plays in this game annoying due to bad AI and glitches. I have seen people sitting in cars that don't exist, for example. I have had missions that dont go correctly because the trigger for the next part of the mission doesn't work. Due to these glitches, I would only recommend to buy this game on sale.

1813	0	a	I was really excited when Homefront:the revolution was announced as an open world game. I didn't play the first game in the series more than a few hours for a plethora of reasons. I even waited when reviews were somewhat spotty at best on this game. This new itteration of the Homefront series has some good quirks and some bad. Let's start with the pros shall we? On the list of pros Homefront presents a somewhat large open world for you to bring freedom to. It seems to breathe, it seems to move and be legitimately animated. When I first started playing I was absorbed into the world and excited to explore it. The next pro would definitely be the weapons. Although there isn't a large variety to be had with this game, what it does let you have are a few archetypes that can be customized to your liking (pistol, shotgun, assault rifle, sniper rifle) and each of these weapons has a feeling that it is scrounged up and hastily put together for a fight with a better equipped enemy. There is also crafting of implements of destruction here as well, mostly just your run of the mill grenades, molotovs, mines... and then you also have a few cool rc bombs and drones at your disposal. I feel like these are the main things the game does really well. On the bad side however I will open up to a list of the cons. The game feels rushed , even with the patches out for it so far (6-7ish months after release). Framerat can stutter at times even on a higher end rig. There is also the problem of render distance for the ai. I've seen many times in game where enemy ai can just suddenly disappear, even while you are looking at them. As you can imagine this hinders players who like to use sniping as their main playstyle. This has even happened up close in many tight quarters firefights. Next up is the gunplay, now to me , the gunplay can seem very blocky and almost robotic feeling. It's nice to have interesting tools of the trade, but if they all feel very robotic or almost clunky to operate that takes away part of the fun of having them. One of the final cons I'm going to touch on is the fact that the ai is very poor. The enemy ai seems to be able to predict where you are at instantaniously and almost without warning at all. They also seem to be able to hit you as soon as you start engaging them, I have very rarely been missed by an ai ever in this game. The health system does little to nothing to help this as when you are playing on the hardest difficulty , if you get hit once you're already dead pretty much. That wouldn't be a big deal if the ai weren't all competition grade shooters. Anyways, if you are looking for a fix on an insurgant like game. I suggest you pick up a game like Red Faction Guerilla instead. I had such high hopes for this game and was disappointed by what I had actually recieved.

2517	0	a	Extremely poor balancing early game. I'm not asking to start out like a dragonborn badass, but this is ridiculous.  I chose a paladin knight as my character on medium difficulty. I try to kill the starter bat creatures on the first quest and can only kill one before im out of stamina and half dead. The fact that they paralyze you every other hit also adds insult to injury. I wonder if they even playtested it, the most frustrating 4 dollars I have ever spent.  It has a very interesting universe and a very nostalgic isometric view of things,but the stat design of this game is currently broken to the point were it is not even playable.
2610	1	a	I would call this game the 'best worst game ever.' It's basically â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ gameplay, a plot taken directly from Twin Peaks, and I love it. It's hard to describe what makes this game so good, without just playing it for yourself. So, pick it up while it's cheap, and play it, and it'll change your life.  Also, the squirrels make monkey sounds, and it's the best.

3006	1	a	This game is the embodiment of so bad its good gaming. the game play, the characters, the visuals, and the controls are a train wreck in the most beautiful way. (insert meaningless number score here).
1458	1	a	I have never written a reivew before because I generally feel like the community or the critics get it right. This game is a different case. This game is so underrated it hurts. I cannot speak for how it played at launch but I can speak to how it plays now. It honestly does something other games dont't, and thats give me a ton of tools but at the same time make me feel like an underdog. In my opinion the shooting is very crisp and strategic. Also the weapon modding is awesome making one gun so much more versitile. Also the story seems decent with a very good setting to boot. The graphics are good but demanding. Because of this if you don't have current hardware you should wait to buy this. so far I am only a few hours in but this feels like a more focused and difficult far cry game. Because of the launch issues this game experienced I think it's reputation got ruined. This is definetly one of those games that needs to be given a second chance because it's to much dang fun not to. To give you an idea I have an FX 8350 OC 4.5 and a GTX 970 and am getting between 35-50 fps on high settings at 1440p. Although these are not great number the game does not stutter at all (except when saving). I would say buy this from a key site or on sale just to be safe because others are still experiencing issues. After playing more I realize that the game is good at first but by the end becomes less alluring. I would still recomend it on a sale  graphics- 8.5 Optimization- 5.5 Story-7 Gameplay-8.5 Atmosphere-9 Fun factor- 8.5 Overall- 8  Even though this game is fun as all hell I would say steer clear unless you meet the recomended system requirements.  As a frame of reference some of my favorite games are the The Wiitcher 1-3, Bioshock 1-Infinite, Dark Souls 1-3, GTA 4-5, and the new wave of Fallout games. I would compare this game to Crysis mixed with Far Cry where you have more tools at your at hand but are also fighting agianst greater odds.
1684	0	a	  This game is just bad as the first Homefront, poor performance on a high-end system. I got myself a GTX1070 and i don't even get 60FPS with everything on high. It feels and plays like an poorly console port.

Beautiful graphics, logical maps and understandable physics. What more can one ask for in a game where the objective is to drive over and gun down hordes of zombies in heavily-accessorised cars? If there's a better zombie-driving game out there, I'd sure like to see it. Good, unclean fun.  Verdict: 9/10.

111	1	a	Demigod is just awesome, and although small in scale, a great option for fans of DoTA-style games. Select from 10 different heroes (Assassins [specialise in taking out enemy heroes] and Generals [specialise in supporting friendly forces and commanding your own units]) each with unique skill trees and abilities, and each with a different playing style. Go stealth/critical damage, ranged caster, close combat disruptor or otherwise, any character will offer you a challenging experience. Only a handful of maps and game modes to choose from, but don't be alarmed; it doesn't get boring if you play multiplayer. Optional community mods available to crank up the gameplay, too, if that's your thing. All around, just awesome *****
1824	1	a	For nomination of 'Game within a Game' award. Finding timesplitters in this game caught me totally off guard. Was so engrossed I forgot I was playing homefront.  For the game itself, it had a lot of potential and played surprisingly well. I didn't ever get the feeling that I could take on the world, which is exactly what I wanted in a Guerrilla warfare type game.  However, the gadgetry could do with being a bit fleshed out. Plus the enemy AI could've used a bit of work. I think I actually enjoyed the story of the first homefront more tbh.  With respect to multiplayer, as much as I liked the multiplayer in the original homefront, I'm not particularly bothered its gone.
1465	0	a	Pink textures, 20fps drops, boring and uninspired plot and gameplay mechanics ripped from other games. I loved Free Radical Design, I loved Perfect Dark...but they should retire now and skip the slow death started with Haze.  The pros though...this game looks amazing. Everything else ranges from mediocre and unspired to utterly awful.  With patches the technical bugs might go. But that won't excuse the fact the plot is basically an amalgamation of COD, Dying Light and Far Cry. And none of those are particularly inspired either (but at least Dying Light had fun gameplay and Far Cry had excellent voiceacting).
2261	0	a	It's fun, it really is.  The graphics aren't that bad. Was really enjoying it.  Then it crashed.  Wait til some more patches come out, needs work before it's fully functional and then it'll be a decent buy.

279	0	a	The game has quite a bit of cool aspects that I listed in pros. Ultimately I got bored and was not as entertained enough by the aesthetics to continue running around the mansion in search of items to use. I do not play this type of game frequently. I lost interest after a few hours of playing. I may pick it up again in the future.   Pros: -The story is interesting -The graphics are decent -The gameplay is fine -Neat secret rooms -Worth the price i paid ($ 5-10?) for the time it held my attention. -A good story unfolds as you advance and you get neat abilities  Cons: -Conitnuously walking around the house to find items that aren't explicitly/implicitly obvious or close by. This may cause you to walk around aimlessly for a while getting absolutely nowhere.. (or I am just not good at it.) -The time it takes to find items caused me to lose interest 
536	0	a	Well first off one of the only reason's i bought this game was the price tag at the time was about 6$ which i would pay for this peice of â¥â¥â¥â¥, First the story sucks all you have to do is kill people with you powers you got from hell (which all suck and are hard to use) Second the controlls are terribale to move sideways is hell, also where you get the powers from Weird hgg? so many things wrong with this game just dont buy it it's a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥

2575	1	a	I was going to say something bad about this game since the PC version of Deadly Premonition has one of the worse ports I have ever encountered (It's really bad on the PC &amp; the devs won't even bother fixing the PC version so Durante had to do their work for them) but I played the Xbox version of Deadly Premonition so I have something different to say (I know the xbox version doesn't include the Director's Cut but I had to play this game to see why it was in the cult section of videogames).  Deadly Premonition Review:  I usually have an average experience on most modern horror games like Outlast for example (I'm a very picky person on what I think is a good horror game) but this game gave me the best experience in the psychological, mystery horror genre &amp; I'm going to try to explain why.  Well for starters this game has one of the most interesting main characters in the world of horror. His name is Francis Morgan a.k.a York who has a split personality named Zach who helps him in his cases, every time he takes a sip of coffee he gets a random fortune or a message from it (I wish my coffee could do that) &amp; he has a unique talent of collecting clues then automatically getting his 'Profiling' skills running in his brain (The way he already knows what's going on is amazing, Sherlock Holmes would be proud). The game's strengths are the story, characters, the open world of Greenvale, the amount of side missions you can do (There are also trading cards that you can collect) &amp; the strong plot twists but there are downsides to this game like the combat for example but I'm not going to mention them because the game forgives it's flaws by having cheesy charm (It's hard to explain).  One of my friends gave a perfect word for this game which is 'Bat â¥â¥â¥â¥ crazy' (I played a lot of disturbing games to the point of being desensitized) &amp; I have to agree because the game has one of the weirdest characters in gaming history like Sigourney for example who is obsessed with warming her pot (Not the drug you idiot) &amp; I can't forget the transformation that Thomas had with a red dress later on in the game (Thomas get the â¥â¥â¥â¥ off drugs). The story to this game is your typical who murdered this person scenario but the way the game feeds you the character's backstories &amp; the amount of thinking is brilliant, this game forces you to not trust everyone but it slowly weeds out your guesses (Me, my friend &amp; my family were having fun trying to guess the murderer &amp; we were all talking about theories on who the murderer is). The fact that the game is a combination of Resident Evil's combat (Resident Evil 4 mostly) &amp; the open world sandbox of Grand Theft Auto is a nice combination from the game director SWERY a.k.a Hidetaka Suehiro so I hope future game devs use an open world sandbox in future horror games.  Overall this game is a good example on how to make a good horror game without overusing cheap scares like jumpscares when the main thing you should be afraid of is the unknown &amp; to be aware of who you trust (If I missed anything then be sure to leave feedback so I can edit my review &amp; I forgot that shaving your beard gives you money).
1821	0	a	There are so many other shooters out there with a much better story. i have just finished to the story line and i can safely say i will never be replaying this game. it will be deleted and never reinstalled.. there is not a single point in the game where you are surpirsed or where the is something you can get excited about. this game is for me the last nail in the coffin for homefront series...

2018	1	a	Don't know why this game has so many bad reviews, its not getting the credit it derserves. Probably people crying about the Online mode not being pvp.  Compared to the first homefront game, it has completely changed. With it being open world and all.  Pros  Decent Graphics Open world I found the story quite good The gameplay is unique with cryengine, feels alot more realistic than all the Call of Dutys i have played. The gun upgrades i liked quite alot Gun Customization is really unique   Cons  Limited Guns Can feel reptitive at times After a few hours of play a day you can get bored. The game can be abit annoying at times   Overall its a decent fps, with a good story, with an open world. You can tell the guys that made this game put alot of work into it, and i believe its better then any Call of duty story you will play, but the Online multiplayer is cooperation, its not so good, which i feel that its a bit of a let down, would of been good if they adopted the PVP from the first Homefront game.  I would recommend buying the game as it can be a lot of fun most times, and if you looking for a FPS to kill alot of hours and liked Homefront 1, you most probably won't be dissapointed.   I wouldn't listen to guys reviews if they havn't even gave the game a chance with like 2-4 hours of play.

2717	1	a	Deadly Premonition is the single greatest mystery adventure game of all time.  That may be a hyperbole statement, but I assure you this is not an exaggeration and I will tell you why you shouldnât miss out on one of the most uniquely produced games that may never be replicated.  In Deadly Premonition you play as special FBI agent Francis York Morgan (just call him York, everyone calls him that) who has an imaginary friend named Zach, gets paid for shaving his beard, viewing the weather channel and gets advice from his coffee. York goes to Greenvale, a small town where a murder has taken place against a woman named Anna Graham, and itâs up to York, as well as the Sheriff: George woodman and Deputy Sheriff Emily Wyatt to solve the townâs biggest case yet.  Once you're past the intro cutscene, you may think that Deadly Premonition is just a survival horror game that takes cues from other survival horror games such as Silent Hill. However once you complete the prologue thinks get much stranger, weirder and funnier.  The game features dialogue that is both bizarre and completely hilarious usually at the same time, and undermines the games more serious scenes with some of the most amusingly inappropriate music they could think of. For example when York witnesses a murder take place, he will be accompanied by smooth jazz while he makes witty remarks, usually in the same room of the victim. When having lunch York will tell tasteless anecdotes about his past cases, one being where âan ingenious law school student â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ over 800 victimsâ to the people sitting nearby him. Just when you think youâve seen the strangest part of the game, something stranger pops up not long after.  Deadly Premonition is not only a mystery and survival horror game, itâs also an open world game where you can find collectibles, do side missions, explore the surprisingly large world and do some quests that require shooting zombie like enemies. The driving is hilariously bad and York takes his time to enter and exit the vehicle, however itâs worth it just to hear York talk to Zach about movie trivia and thoughts on the case.  Some submissions can only be tackled during certain times of the day, and usually consists of fetch quests. However doing side missions can net you some goodies, such as a fast travel radio, a submachine gun with infinite ammunition, and trading cards that you can collect.  When youâre not driving around, collecting collectables or talking to the locals, youâll be doing one of the many shooting sequences of the game that play out a bit like Resident Evil 4. That being said, the combat is very simple and doesnât get difficult until halfway through the game, despite this these action sequences can be fun as you build up an arsenal of weapons that include pistols, shotguns and machine guns. While youâre shooting enemies you may encounter the âRaincoat Killerâ who is the mysterious culprit you are after, upon encountering you will either have to do a QuickTime event, run away, or hide in a locker to make sure he doesnât find you. Even though these sequences are predictable, they can be a good change of pace.  I think I should also mention the graphics; they wonât impress anybody and this was meant to be a Playstation 2 game at one point in development, however the poorly done animations are very comical and had me dying of laughter at points. The sounds are sometimes equally as bad; guns sound like pea shooters and use stock sound effects sometimes and the voice acting is the best kind of bad.  Despite having atrocious graphics, poor sound and simple Gameplay, the game manages to do the whole âso bad itâs goodâ tactic perfectly.  Itâs nearly impossible for me to describe some of the more bizarre moments of deadly premonition, but because of the low budget looks and bizarreness of the storyline, Deadly Premonition is one of the most uniquely crafted games I have ever played.  The game excels at providing one of the most bizarre, confusing and entertaining narratives in a computer game, itâs like watching a beautiful train wreck happening on your computer screen, and depending on how you feel, you may even feel a bit emotional at the end of the game, I know I did.  After completing Deadly Premonition, I was sad, very sad, because the main storyline was deemed complete; no game has ever made me laugh so hard to the point of tears more than Deadly Premonition, and it is worth every penny for its comical value.  However I think itâs now time to bring up an issue that plagues the pc port, and that is that it is a poor port that suffers from crashing, fixed resolution and lack of graphical options. If you are going to buy Deadly Premonition, buy it on a console, if you donât have a console, purchase it on PC and download a few mods to fix the issues.  If youâre curious what Deadly Premonition is ultimately like, Jim Sterling said it best: âDeadly Premonition is like watching two clowns eat each other. Itâs perverse, itâs wrong, and yet itâs so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing funny.â  There is no other title in the gaming industry that matches the sheer hilarity and bizarreness as Deadly Premonition.  The game is not only so bad itâs good; itâs so bad its borderline perfection!

1486	0	a	I've always thought Homefront was an underrated game, and prior to release I had somewhat high expectations for Homefront: The Revolution. But, what I see here is a Far Cry clone, and a bad one at that. It takes elements from most popular games of the last half decade and doesn't really have anything that helps it standout from the rest of the copy pasta open world games.   So, I went into this game with low expectations, and even getting the game for 20$, I have a really hard time recommending this. I am a sucker for Ubisoft games like Assassin's Creed and Far Cry, and I have a feeling the developers of H:TR are as well, so they tried to mimic that, and it just turned out mediocre. Most of what the world has to offer, side content wise, is the same 3 or 4 things copy and pasted 50 times, just like a Ubisoft game, but in THIS it's even more meaningless.  The gameplay is alright, the weapon customization was ripped straight out of Crysis, the enemies take way too many shots to kill (for example, a pistol being 2 shots to the head at point blank range, wtf?), while you can die in about 5 or 6 shots, and this is on the medium difficulty. If you think dying in 5 or 6 shots sounds reasonable, imagine 15 Korean dudes shooting at you with fully auto weapons. You die very quickly and very often, and for a game like this is not ok.  The AI is dumb as a rock, when going into combat they seem to infinitely spawn until you either run away and hide, or die, which will happen a lot, because the game is difficult for no reason.  The story is nothing to really pay attention to, the characters look cool, but they're dull, of course, just like the rest of the game.  The only good thing about the game might be the graphics. It runs on Cry Engine, so naturally it will look half decent.   I don't know if I missed anything. I've played it for a few hours and I feel like I've seen it all. I had somewhat high hopes for this, and it really could have been good, but it's just a poorly made, rushed mess.   With all that said, and the fact that the game has many, MANY problems, I must say I do find it somewhat enjoyable. It's not the kind of game to get super invested into, but it's fun to play for an hour at a time, every now and then.  I'd give this 4/10. Not a good game, but also not the worst.
2179	0	a	Literal downgrade, how can it be a good game, when it is no longer a Chris Kyle Simulator?
1133	1	a	Very fun. Don't go into the game as a sandbox murder game (that's the sequel). It's a puzzle game and as such there is not a lot of replayablity as there is usually only one way to solve the puzzles. Think of it more like a 3D Phoenix Wright game and you'll enjoy it. Little Lucius is very fun little murderer to play as and watching the family (especially the mother) go nuts as the body count in the house rises is a treat. The murders are also all pretty inventive and fun to watch. Some are just downright gruesome. Give it a playthrough with these things in mind and you'll probably like it.
1678	1	a	If you enjoy Farcry or any type of game like that then this game will be enjoyable to you.
2083	1	a	Despite the complaints of all the reviewers, this actually is far from terrible.  With a bit more polish this would have been a great game, in the state it's in currently it's merely 'good'. There are a few bugs and some features aren't as fleshed out as they should have been, but none of it is gamebreaking and it won't severely affect your enjoyment of what is ultimately quite an engaging experience.   The combat is as good as any other AAA FPS, the environments/level design is gorgeous and varied, and the exploration is very fun. The devs have obviously put a lot of passion and work into this project, and through no fault of their own it's been hampered by studio bankrupcy and a slashed budget. Despite this, the game still shines and is very fun to play. A lot of effort seems to have been put into reducing the repetitiveness, preventing the player from getting bored. I'm about 10 hours in and I'm not getting that familiar dragging bored feeling I usually get when playing open world FPS's.   If you enjoyed games like Just Cause, Dead Island, Red Faction Guerilla, and Far Cry, you'll definitely like Homefront: The Revolution. If your PC is powerful and you're good at FPS's, you'll have a blast.    BETTER THAN: Farcry 3 and 4  WORSE THAN: Fallout 4

582	1	a	'Lucius' Developed by Shiver Games and published by Lace Mamba Global. It was released October 26th 2012. The game is set in the 1970âs and is a horror adventure game.   Gameplay 6/10  I enjoyed the game play. I walked into the game blind so I didnât have any expectations. Itâs in third person. You move with the usual WASD keys. The game is linear so you donât have much choice in what happens. But, itâs got a nice story to it. Only thing I really disliked was the way they implemented the third person cam without the option of a first person view. It got awkward in some instances trying to kill someone. You also donât talk the entire game. So, if you like silent protagonists, Lucius(character) is for you.   Music/sound 5/10  The soundtrack for this game really helped set the mood for the things you were doing. It really helped in the immersion of the game. Iâm not sure what other people thought about the voice acting. But at certain times it was nice and other times not so much. Creativity 6/10 This story was rather nice, I liked it. All through the game the story is nice; the narration between chapters is done well. But, the one thing that broke me was the ending. Left so many questions unanswered. Other than that itâs a normal adventure game.   Graphics 8/10  The graphics are nice considering this is an indie game. The fires are decent, though with my testing on lower graphics theyâre a bit blocky for the poor low end computers out there. Not pretty. But, on the highest setting theyâre fine.   Replay Value 5/10  The replay value of this game isnât much. But, if you want to kill a few people while following a decent story, I can see you coming back to this.   Enjoyment 8/10  Maybe Iâm a sadistic person. I really enjoyed finding out how to murder the people without getting caught quite fun. I had a blast with the death cutsceens as well.   Overall 6.5/10  This is a decent game. I recommend it to anyone who likes linear adventure/puzzle games. It has a satisfactory story and you get satisfaction for killing the people. Just donât expect an over the top ending, it leaves you with questions.    References. R1 =  http://shivergames.com/  R2 =  http://www.lace-mamba.com/   Please comment, I'm always looking to improve!

Prepare to read, read, and read, hack, hack, shoot, and use potions, and sell old armor, to use new. Save, die, and reload. Just like the old days, its about the story... and while their is a journal, you really need to 'stay' with it, or you will forget the many intriguing and subliminal turns it takes you on. Stop playing at your own risk.

80	0	a	pls dont play this game
21	1	a	Dont pay any attention to the number of hours I have played it on steam. I have owned this game from the first time it came out. And I have hundreds of hours on this game.  This is one game that does not get the respect it deserves. It is a complicated MOBA and it requires you to think on how your strategy is to be played out. And it is not as fast as games like DOTA2, so it gives you a little time to think (not much though). It is not a MOBA like Dota games. In this game you do not destroy towers, except for the citadel which will end the game. In Demigod you control flags and each flag has different buffs and the control of the object they are near. (I.E. Portals,) When you control a flag that is next to a portal you team gets that portal and the minions that come out of that portal belong to your team as long as you control the flag. Plus there are character upgrades and Citadel upgrades and you can buy artifacts from the store or a special store that requires the capture of a flag. Also there are artifact upgrades that you can purchase with Favor points that stay with you from game to game. And the characters have a lot of spells that completely identify to their character type. Pretty much everyone agrees that the graphics and animation is stunning, and they are. And for a 2009 game they hold up to any game. And the strategy is deep and you will learn to hate your friends all over again. This game is brutal and non-forgiving. The main complaints from people are 1. No tutorial. And it doesnât. This was a bad mistake by GPG. The game does have a strong learning curve. This causes people not to understand the game, and go on to something else. 2. The internet lobby is bad. And it is. The Internet Lobby is limited. But my friends mostly play among ourselves. It works over internet and Local LAN Hosting.   For me it is good to have a MOBA that is not like DOTA, Not that I have complaints about DOTA and I also play DOTA2, but there are just so many DOTA like games out there. And most of them seem to have the same map, and the interfaces seem to close to the same. If not an outright copy.

After waking up and seeing old Satan himself telling a 10 year to go do the dirty deeds is entertaining in itself. Sadly after trying to sneak to kill someone It is dissapointing to be caught by your mom who scholds you and tells you to march right back to bed. If there were more customization options then the linear story and powers this might have done amazingly. 4 / 10

2868	1	a	Without spoiling the game and giving away what makes this so special, I will simply say that Deadly Premonition is one of the most underrated and brilliant video games ever created. Full applause and credit to the one and only Swery65 for making a game that despite it's major shortcomings (controls, graphics, PC optimization) is the most engrossing and intelligent games out there. And again without spoiling anything, has the best twist in a story that proves just how important the video game medium is.  If you're even remotely interested in this game, just pick it up. Especially at such a cheap price ($2.49 as of this review), you'll be getting a game that you can sink hours into playing and days upon days discussing with your friends. Just be sure to look up some of the user made patches like DPFix to get the most out of the game.
2854	1	a	What this game lacks in visuals Alan Wake has them, what Alan Wake lacks in ambition this game has it. This game is a problem, but a good one.
1125	1	a	When I originally bought this game, I was unsure if I was going to like it or not. Let me start off by saying I really did enjoy this game. One thing I should mention is that I personally didn't believe this game was so much of a 'horror game', it was more of an interesting story about a posessed boy, nothing in the game is really 'scary'; however, the game doesn't fail to include several violent and gorey death scenes. Only complaint about the game was that it went a little quicker than I wanted it to, but luckily, Lucius 2 is available to anyone who enjoyed the game!!!!!!! Would definetly recommend to anyone who is up for an interesting (but not too lengthy) story.
2667	1	a	This game is just amazing! What else can I say? Yes, a bit strange. I mean... I first heard about it from a guy, who played prologue and all the the time said something like 'How glitchy it is' and 'He speaks with coffee??? What a psycho!'. He didn't play after this, but after this 'little conversation' I wanted to play this so much. So I without second thinking bougth this ASAP. And I have never regretted about it.  PS. I didn't have any glitches, so, I think, my friend just had problems with his computer.
2887	1	a	If youâre going to measure Deadly Premonition using traditional gaming yardsticks like graphical fidelity, gameplay challenge, and overall polish, then this Directorâs Cut still comes up short of modern standards even with the fixes. Yet despite any obvious technical shortcomings, it succeeds on the strength of its story, its characters, and its countless WTF moments. It doesnât feature enough new content to interest existing fans, but if you want to find out which side of the love-it-or-hate-it divide you're on, nowâs the perfect time to play one of the most memorable and utterly insane survival-horror games ever made in its most accessible form.
2347	0	a	'Time to refund' 21 minutes boys &amp; girls  Another Pile of $hit release. Made me value the division that much more, and I hate that game!  
368	1	a	Atmospheric game.8/10
2154	1	a	So I went into this game almost completely blind, my friend and I were looking for a game to play together and didnât find anything until I found this game. We waited until this game came out and bought it on release. We were reading the comments about how optimization was poor and how it was slow and lagging and etc. We both have very good computers and both of us were able to successfully load the game. As with many newer games you may need a decent computer. The graphics are impressive, and neither him or me experienced major issues concerning it lagging. This game has a really promising multiplayer although the story fell a bit flat. The multiplayer, in my opinion, is the best part of the game and I loved it for the first four(ish) hours. The small amount of maps limits the playability of the game since there isnât a lot of different ways to play each map. Let me just say that this is a really fun multiplayer game with some interesting missions. The problem is there are what six maps, maybe seven? Half are based on offense and the others are defensive. I already payed $60 for this game, why do I have to pay about $6 for more maps that probably are the same type of missions. A lot of people are complaining about the bad AI, I disagree. The AI is pretty good at spotting you (and killing you). We only encountered a dead body glitching through a wall. In the multiplayer the enemies aren't always positioned in the same space when you start, and I really enjoyed that added challenge.  What I really don't enjoy about multiplayer other than the limited maps and somewhat repetitive missions, is that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ lady on the coms. 'What's the hold up!' 'What's the hold up!' Oh, I don't know? Maybe the two tanks that just rolled in? Constantly annoying me when I don't speed through a level. She is the Navi of Homefront. This also brings up another point, the game doesnât want you to stealth. The knife killing animations are awesome, like oh my God watching another player knife an unsuspecting soldier is cool. So naturally, we wanted to try to do missions in stealth. After trying to sneak, we realized something: this game doesn't want you to sneak. Sure the snipers are easy targets for your knife, but on the ground, where you are most of the time, you have limited stealth options. No sneak rolling/running or anything that's common in games that want to provide a stealth option. Well you may be asking, 'well Guy Fieri this game isnât meant for stealth, itâs about guns!' To that I would reply with saying that the game wanted to provide a guerrilla style warfare that is common in American war history. A part of it is sneaking. Also, in your skill tree you can pick up several sneak related skills like not being seen as easily by enemies. Why give me that skill when I can't get a silencer until I buy x amount of crates (which I suggest focusing on getting weapons and armor before attachments) and as soon as I fire every single enemy in the entire universe knows exactly where I am? This limits the ways to play their small selection of maps. Also another problem, that i'm sure a little later won't be a problem, I can't seem to find any servers? There is a story, and admittedly I havenât played a bunch, but what I have played is average. Unskippable, boring cutscenes giving me unwanted explanations of the situation are the first ten minutes of the game. Then*spoilers* the two people you are with die. Walker gets arrested, and you go to the main resistance in the area. They get mad at you when you fall into their well marked tunnel and start beating you up before asking for authentication? No, iâm sorry you are the worst tunnel keeper in history.*end spoiler.* Again this is just the beginning maybe it gets better later, there are better people to talk about the story than me. I do recommend this game though, like I said the multiplayer is fun. One thing I find very impressive is that for the multiplayer to feel fun you donât need another friend. Your mic is always on which I think gives a realness to the game. After taking away the good graphics, there is a good game. The gun mechanics are good and I really like the skill tree and the way you obtain weapons and gear. I think what would make the multiplayer better is obviously adding more maps for free, but also opening up areas for mass multiplayer games like a team deathmatch and capture the flag. Also I wish that in multiplayer and the main story we were able to customize our character, and I donât mean picking from a few female characters and a few male characters. Overall 7/10.

697	0	a	Lucius is a slightly interesting, yet generally bad game. The story centers around Lucius, the devil's alleged son who has been asked to murder people in demonic ways. It's not combat-oriented, you just cause accidents to hurt/kill people.  It's new, but also quite bad. The story is lame, and the dialogue is drawn out and boring. Gameplay itself is excruciatingly awful. Killing random people by locking them in a freezer is not only unnecessarily gruesome, it's also not fun at all.  Don't get me started on the animations and graphics. Not that it's like a bad port, but they just did a terrible job modeling the people; mouths and voices are also not in sync.  Overall, a waste of my money.

1529	0	a	  'The credits began with an apology'  Homefront: The Dance Dance Revolsution is a video game about NORTH KOREA conquering the world through electronics and military hardware sales.  North Korea, in the Homefries Timeline, is, at the 1960.. 80s .. starting from the 1970s, was a more advanced economic/industrial power than the USA and JApAN COMBINED.  That made me laugh so hard I got dizzy.  By the time I woke up from nearly blacking out, I was being tortured by the Fictional North Korean Army that conquered America while the entire world sat on its hands and watched. Then, I was being tortured by the AMERICAN REVOLUTIONARIES of the game who joked about how â¥â¥â¥â¥ing tortured I was about to get and how â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ dead I was about to be. Cool introduction to the heroes.  There are no sympathetic characters in this game. They are all horrible monsters. When they arenât, theyâre still annoying charicatures that barely symbolize peace, cruelty, and justice.  The game itself is serviceable: You shoot enemies, they flinch and go down. Itâs incredibly repetitive, and liberating the city becomes a waste of time quickly enough, divided into free fire Red zones, and the slightly more interesting Yellow zones that blend stealth and sabotage (terrorism) against your oppressors. Weapons are fairly interesting, able to break them down into variants that wildly change their behavior, but nothing youâve not seen before. You have everything from a pistol to the rocket propelled gurnade. Most interesting is the HACKING GRENADE TOOL, which flips the allegiance of enemy robots against them. The most fun thing in the game by far!  The game sucks patriotic â¥â¥â¥â¥ the whole way through against a jingoistic nightmare.   (played the game during its free period)

3035	1	a	A platformer-puzzle game with a huge map, and I mean really REALLY HUGE. I'm almost 20 hours into the game and I explored like 60% of the map. Take Metroid with less pew pew and mix it with dozens of secret rooms. Add funny dialog (beware adult language) puzzles (some of them are challenging but not infuriating) and nature backgrounds. Don't let the 1st (here you learn the game basic mechanics) and 2nd (here you learn how to play as a ball, another form you can transform into) missions fool you. They're short and easy, but they're just a training for the extremely long 3rd mission. The downside for me is the music. I don't mind relaxing music, in fact I like it. But this game is just ambiental noises: birds chirping, wind blowing, etc. It's calm but sometimes you'd prefer more elaborated tunes.

2759	1	a	Legendary game.  Twin Peaks, if interpreted by an unrestricted Japanese developer. Itâs a mystery-adventure game, not exactly a horror title. I'd say it shares more with Shenmue than Silent Hill. The cast of the game and their interactions provide for some of the most memorable game moments. Unfortunately gameplay, in terms of combat, lacks polish and will be considered abysmal by some.  If you want something different, a game that provides something far from Ubisoft's triple-a game dispenser products, give this one a shot. (The definitive version is the Xbox 360 version)  My favorite game of all time. My comfy game.
2357	1	a	I have been waiting for a sequal to the original game for quite some time. The original didnt make a huge splash but there are a lot of us who still enjoyed it. This game feels a lot like the origial in my short time playing so in that respect I am happy. It is a little buggy but most games are on day 1, and its not anything a quick patch wont fix. I like it so its getting a thumbs up from me, if you dont like it so far why dont you give them a week to work out the cinks before you mindlessly hop on the hate train.

1265	1	a	Only get this game if you have a gamepad game has keyboard controls but it's not precise enough in my opinion. also of note is that keyboard controls can't be configured although I worked around it by using autohotkey.  recommended because I can't say I'm not recommending it with the very little I played (yes I'm missing a gamepad)

2375	0	a	Its a great Game Overall. There is just one MAJOR problem when I play and thats Im stuck on one base and It wont unlock the door for me. I toss all the hack tools I can get my hands on under a fence and it supposedly hacks the Box into opening the door, However The door will refuse to open. I cant break the door with bolt cutters either. GAME WAS TOO LAGGY
307	0	a	  I spent almost the entirety of my time playing this with no idea where to go, not because I wasn't sure how to complete the objective, but because the design of the house in this game is abysmal and the map is useless because half the time it doesn't have any markers. When I was where I was supposed to be and completing the objectives this game was fun, but those times are few and far between with all of the monotonous searching around this terrible house

1011	0	a	Monotonous killings, and only a few ways to do so makes this game rather lackluster. After waking up and seeing old Satan himself telling a 10 year to go do the dirty deeds is entertaining in itself. Sadly after trying to sneak to kill someone It is dissapointing to be caught by your mom who scholds you and tells you to march right back to bed. If there were more customization options then the linear story and powers this might have done amazingly. 4 / 10

796	1	a	To be honest I didn't expect much from this game, but I was pleasantly surprised! The graphics, gameplay, BGM and voice acting is average (the voice actress for Lucius's mum was pretty good though!), however the concept of playing the Antichrist made this a very entertaining experience.  Imagine this game as a horror movie, it would be very scary and suspenseful with all the mysterious unexplained deaths. However, playing as Lucius it was up to me to make these deaths happen and not be caught in the process.   Grab this game when it's on sale!
2241	1	a	So Im not one to ever write a reviwe, I felt this game, despite its bugs and quirks, is one of the better well writen games Ive played in a long time. At the time of writing this the game has not been patched for preformance or some of the bugs, hell the frist time I started the game I had no video, just a black screen with audio. While this was discouraging the game play mechanics and over all writing of the story keep me going.  Id recommend this game, although you may want to wait for the patch they say will be coming soon, and keep in mind this game has nothing to do wtih that god alfaw frist homefront game other than the north koreans invade.

2444	1	a	Inquisitor tries to emphasize your role as an inquisitional investigator over the role of the average hack-and-slash adventurer. When it succeeds at doing so, the game is good, great even. My fondest moments with Inquisitor involve happening upon a random person in an unexpected place, as I was always eager to begin questioning in hopes of learning a tidbit of information that could point to a heretic (and the entirety of the townsfolk were already squeezed dry of new leads). This didn't always pan out of course, many questions just result in a dead end, but that's exactly what made the experience so enjoyable. Without the cut and dried certainty that any NPC or line of dialogue important enough to be coded in would be important enough to move the plot forward, full scrutiny must be applied to everything. Complete exploration was thus also worthwhile, especially with the risk of torturing or burning an innocent at stake. The game goes wrong, however, when it turns away from text-based investigation and throws itself headlong into dungeon crawling. The combat is both obtuse and tedious. Enemies give no indication of how much life they may have or how close you may have been to defeating them which means that there's no way of telling if you were on the verge of success or if you need to completely reevaluate your approach. Weapons and armor break at alarming rates and with dungeons that may go on for anywhere from three to nine full floors; even devoting a quarter of your inventory to replacements will see you making a couple of trips to the surface for repairs. Status effects have a similar feeling to them, like they may have been designed for causing pain over fun. Poison lasts for nearly four full minutes and drains both health and stamina, the latter being the resource needed to fight effectively. Some status aliments skip the character and affect the player directly by changing the cursor's behavior. Blindness, disorientation and confusion cause the cursor to disappear, invert, or wiggle around. These ideas themselves are interesting and could be used to make for a more tense experience, but any charm or fear they might have inflicted is killed by their frequency; there is simply no avoiding them. The lesson the game seems to teach, then, is not to bother out-thinking or overpowering your enemies, but just to accept more losses. Expect to use more potions, have more equipment break, and see more companions die in order to finish each successive encounter. Which, oddly enough, suits the dirty, violent, depressing aesthetic of the setting. Inquisitor pulls no punches with its set pieces. There will be mass graves, disemboweled corpses, and tortured screams, all in full detail. The background music and the item descriptions buttress this effect, making for a truly unsettling experience. If you can see your way past the slog that is combat, past the typos, past the irritation of getting stuck in a wall for the tenth time, there is the skeleton of a fantastic game here. And one well worth trying.

1188	1	a	After playing this game i literally googled 'how to make a pact with satan'.. The game has nice storyline and convinced me I could be the decendent of lucifer (praise be to him) himself.. Anyone who loves to manipulate peoples' life and be the cause of their suffering then play this game..Finished it in a few days though with some walkthrough help..
2713	1	a	The game works fine for me following these instructions from the forums:  1 - Go to your DP game directory: right click on the game in your Steam Library - properties - Local Files - Browse local files 2 - Launch the 'PhysX_SystemSoftware.msi' file in the 'redist' directory and execute the Uninstall process 3 - Re-launch the 'PhysX_SystemSoftware.msi' to install it. 4 - Now launch the 'PDLauncher.exe' as Administrator.  As for the game itself, the gameplay seems smooth though not entirely intuitive. I tried playing with both the controller and the keyboard/mouse, and definitely recommend the keyboard/mouse. The story seems fleshed out so far, but I will review all this later after I get more hours into the game. I just wanted to put the game fix into a review fairly quickly since the game is available for a sizeable discount right now: $2.49
2671	1	a	It's like Stephen King wrote script and David Lynch directed... (sic!) a videogame! A videogame that didn't suck! Highly recommended!

1495	0	a	After less than 2 hours of gameplay, I must say this is a game you DO NOT want to play. The story is somewhat interesting though I found a game breaking bug that not only ruined the game but brought to light other issues. Singleplayer Only!  The Pros: Graphics are pretty good Custimization is ok but nothing too great except the modification change.  The Bad: The bugs are too many to really even count.  The game feels sluggish with a 980ti - poor optimization Game breaking bugs that end the storyline/optional side misisons Enemies don't drop guns or give ability to pick up guns, instead ammo for whatever gun you use. Game is not unique at all. It feels like they tried to make a hybrid of several games but failed. Terrible voice acting.    
1670	1	a	Honestly, sometimes you just need a dumb shooter that's easy to pick up and put down. The mechanics are simular to Far Cry and the city setting is kinda cool.  DON'T play this for the story. DO play this if you just want something to play that you don't need to get too invested in.  Doesn't deserve any awards, but it's fun in the blowing off steam after work/school

What really sticked out for me were the day and night cycles and how that changed a map. It's not the best shooter I have played it but it's the best recent single player shooter for sure. It got me hooked until the end.

1894	0	a	  Meh. If I didn't have anything else to play, I'd say it's ok. But fortunately I do have other games. I don't really feel the atmosphere of occupation/resistance fighting, I'm not immersed, I don't like the design of the open world. Gunplay is not the best, stealth sucks and overall gameplay feels rather clunky and unpolished. Missions aren't overly creative nor fun. The characters aren't particularly engaging and the MC is completely mute, which sucks outside of Half-Life games. Oh, and it's sorta buggy, settings don't save at all (getting correct resolution, texture quality and so on took me good half an hour or more, and involved using some workarounds). Well, at least the visuals are nice, though I find everything about design tired, the uniforms, the vehicles, the drones, the metal outposts.  It's not an entirely bad game, just not a very good one either. Doesn't feel like an AAA title which it strives to be.

820	1	a	Impressive game, which puts you in a skin of a child posessed by the devil. Child needs to give souls to his father - Lucifer, by creating 'accidents' that take lives of people around big mansion he is living. It is very cruel game, that shows every death in slow-mo and with maximum details. And it purely unique and very fun to play. Beaten it in one evening.
2735	1	a	For a game that has problems with its pc port, it's a fun pc port, especially for certain things such as the diner conversation or when York holds his own conversation about films. If you want to make sure it plays smoothly and with a different resolution, you will have to modify the game. Here's a guide for anyone interested:  http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Deadly_Premonition:_The_Director%27s_Cut   In terms of gameplay, combat is rather ordinary, playing like Resident Evil 4 with the over-the-shoulder aiming. Driving is a bit wonky, especially if you drive the car from using the flare (Compared to the police car, the speed is rather fast as though York decided to floor it.). QTE's exist and they require some quick input. Outside of combat, the game does give players side activities to do.  Also, the coffee says 'F.K.'
789	1	a	Lucius is a game very heavily based on the movie 'The Omen'. It's a great game that places you in the role of the devil's child Lucius. Despite it looking like a horror game, it is not really scary since you are the threat that's killing people on the go. You get a big mansion with a lot of staff in which you will kill them one by one in seperate chapters.  Overall the game feels like a puzzle game, and a pretty tough game at that. I really enjoyed playing it. I'm just going to list some positives and negatives below:  YES Great idea for a game Big location Gruesome deaths A lot of backstory on most characters Awesome demonic powers So much death!  NO A lot of bugs and glitches Controls make you feel like you are driving a tank instead of controlling a 6-year old Bad voice acting for some characters Not scary Very linear  Despite the games awesomeness, there are a lot of bugs and glitches. In the second chapter, the mom kept walking into the door leasing outside, despite it being locked. Also, the telekineses power is very hard to use most of the time. There have also been a couple of instances in which I hard to start a chapter again because people would not die when they were supposed to, or stayed put when they were supposed to wak out of the room.   Despite all of this, Lucius is an awesome little game that puts you in the bad guy's shoes. A part 2 is on its way, so let's hope the developers have learned from their mistakes and will release an awesome sequal!

2100	0	a	Clunky. Clumsy and Uninspired.   I was really looking forward to playing this game. I was excited to hear that it was open world and you were playing a resistance fighter. Cool setting. Running around free running blowing stuff up and generally and kicking â¥â¥â¥â¥.... well not so much of any of thatâ¦  You can only climb certain buildings at certain points so there goes the whole jumping around (it takes about 5 tried to jump over a f###ing railing) The âOpen Worldâ is just quarantined cells that you cut between with some tunnels. Gun fights felt underwhelming, I couldnât aim for â¥â¥â¥â¥ with a controller. The controls just feel off to me. Not a good game. If you can get it under Â£20 then by all means give it a try. But to me this game is horrible.  You start locked in a cinematic opening that really had no f###ing point what so ever. You get introduced to some guy who seems to be the main leader but had absolutely no back up. Like he is the main inspirational figure and he had a pistol. Like not even a guy with him that gets shot in the head. Nothing. A pistol and then he gets shot in the leg. It just happens to make you try and give a sh##. I felt absolutely no emotional attachment to the man and then you are expected to run around and try and save him.  You spend half your time killing guys armed with some awesome guns but you cant pick em up and use them? Why? It was never explained. You donât see them on the ground. I mean you even have friendlies that get shot and drop rifles and all kind of stuff. Can you pick them up? No. I saw a backpack for sale at the store and then came across a backpack in a shipping container. Can you throw it over your shoulder and use that instead of buying one? No. This game is seriously bad.  
775	1	a	This is a short, demented puzzle game where you play as the son of the devil as he goes about his father's requests to kill off everyone he knows. Surprisingly challenging puzzles can be find here. Clever levels in general, lots of achievements, and a decent sized map to explore. Definitely pick it up on sale!
151	1	a	If you played the demo and thought you liked it I reccomend this. It is a team vs. team game. It is like League or Dota, but from the 2000s. This game is older, but still very fun in a different way that I can't put my finger on. I recommend that you get this game if you have the time and money for it.

1076	0	a	Recomend or not. It is hard to decide with this game.  The graphics arn't that good, but for the price I have seen worse. It is a very linear game with not that many options of what to do or not. The majority of the achievements are easy and fun to get if you ignore the 20 hour and 40 hour achievement. The game is much to short to get them without wasting electricity of the pc keeping the game active while you find something more interesting to do.   The ways you have to kill people is midly creative and fun to find out, but that is pretty much where the fun ends.

2227	1	a	After 6 hours and cleared some zones I can clearly say that I'm just having fun with this game. Don't get me wrong, the performance is not good for half of us, I had to low down too much things for my taste, but if this is patched, you have a decent semi-open world shooter with a story I pretty much like and lot of side stuff to do. Yeah, it's repetitive, but If repetitive tasks is not for you, then I recommend to never play a game haha :)  You unlock parts of the map like a Far Cry game and you loot and play vertically like Dying Light sometimes, and that's a good thing. You also feel that you are in a rebellion, the atmosphere is good and the graphics are enough to believe the world you are in. There is so much little details everywhere that you know they worked for real on the level design. The controls and gunplay are ok, sometimes you try to jump in a window and it does not work at the first try, guns have good recoil but I like how you feel like an actual street rebel who can't shoot instead of a genious army shooter with 150 years of experience lol. AI get stuck or is a little dumb here and there, but nothing game breaking at all, you know, funny bugs.  It's clear that it's not the perfect game of the year but for me it's a pleasant FPS with a story I like.  Gaming culture is at its worse at the moment I think. It's like nobody can enjoy a game anymore. I'll be fair tho, if the optimization is not fixed, wait for it to be fixed before buying, or enjoy the game anyway like I do because the world don't turn around me and anyway the gameplay is fun. I know everything positive will be thumbed down maybe here, and negative will we thumbed up. I see no reason at all to take a side, it's just my opinion and opinions differ. Thanks for reading and if you speak french and have this game, add me for some coop missions (campaign is solo).  Update: I finished the game and I had some good hours with it. I think it's another hidden rough gem for old school FPS fans.
2438	1	a	Better that reviews.  Seems to be patched quite well since lauch. Was no were near complete at that point.  Not perfect but delivers fun querilla stuff in nice setting. Far Cry all over it but has more serious tone in it.  With 12 â¬ it is a quite a bargain!
166	1	a	Such a cool game! How is this sooo cheap!?!?
2240	0	a	Decision time: play a bit more to see if things get better, or stop playing so my refund window doesn't close. Easy decision. Only took an hour.  Given that a large chunk (or maybe all - idk) of the first hour of the single player game mostly consists of cutscene-like  things , I jumped into the co-op mode with two friends. That's what I bought the game for anyway. We were treated to downgraded visuals, silly clipping issues, and absurd NPC behavior (call it Artificial Unintelligence). It was not fun, not even in the ironic sense where bad game design can be unintentionally hilarious. It just sucked - in an entirely bland and tedious way.  Homefront: the Revolution isn't ready. For anything. It's the Aliens: Colonial Marines of 2016. In honor of the 16th anniversary of Old Man Murray's 'Time-to-Crate' review system, I'll grade HtR on a scale of 'Time-to-Refund,' and give it a score of 20 minutes (the time I spent in the co-op). I think that's like a 17 out of a possible 100, if 100 represents the two-hour refund window, or something. Who cares.  Save your 60 bucks for something else, like a vacation to Detroit. I hear it's nice this time of year.
2521	0	a	Honestly I am sorry, but this game was absolutely terrible for many reasons but I will try to hard boil it to 5. (Don't want to read them all? I made a summary at the bottom :3)  1. The Gameplay: Four words: Crappy Version Of Diablo  2. The Story: Honestly the theme of this story is very well founded, It would seem like a great idea for a book or a movie. But VIDEO GAME?... eh maybe not.  3. Lack of Playable Character Diversity: This game's selection of characters was, as best as I can say it, incomplete. Ok you got a warrior, a priest, and a thief... Then the author just dropped it there. Seriously!? How about including something like a witch (or warlock) or maybe an unarmed fighter like a monk (or something similar). The roster looked like the author made it to the thief and just said 'screw it that's fine'.  4. Vocal: Or should I say lack thereof. This game was like a silent movie the whole way through. I don't mind reading but I do like to hear a voice behind the text. Plus some of the times you talk to people the text is like 10 or 15 lines long so some vocals would help there.  5. Difficulty: Immensely difficult. Too much for an RPG. I don;t mind and even LIKE a little difficulty. But this game pretty much just throws your butt into the middle of the road and just says 'Ok you're here, you're on your own; have fun'. You have no idea where you 're supposed to go after the first place you start in. Plus the monsters are so difficult that even on easy I couldnt make it past the Necromancer in the Crypt (Can't recall his bloody name right now). And with no autosave, you die and forgot to save for like 2 hours you're screwed.  To Make this short, Its Diablo 2 with the story, gameplay, PC (PC=playable character) roster, and vocals cranked down to zero and blown up with a Holy Hand Grenade, and the difficulty cranked up to bloody 11. I got it on a special and It wasn't even worth the minuscule amount I paid.

267	1	a	I totally owe this game a nice review.  No, I really do not approve of lil kids being possessed murderers, but this game is somehow compelling! I wasn`t searching for guides  or walktroughs, so it stroke me slowly in time - I will take care of every single one of them, one by one.    Even my ... oh my!!     So in this emotional state, you somehow need to loose your humanity  and try to focus on the FUN parts /there are plenty,  like the TRICYCLE, changing weather, some achievements, the way you need to listen,  watch and follow clues, the automatic innocent status, because you are supposed to be a little ANGEL not a little devil.. they will find out too late..  The atmosphere can satisfy your darker tastes, actually  the whole game does it. Give it a try :) Just don`t try any of it at home!! :D
622	0	a	Holy Crap, was this not any where even remotely close to the game I was expecting and in this case, that's a bad thing.  Don't come into this game thinking its a free roam multiple choice adventure where you play the Antichrist, no, rather its a very linear, do it this way or not at all, bore of a game. There is no deviation of choice, there is no abuse of demonic powers, just very sepcific ways you have to kill people placed in an open world to give you the illusion of choice when really it just pads the game out to make it seem like its worth a whopping $20 dollars. This game is not worth its full price or even on sale, its worth a dollar, because this isn't really a game: its an interactive movie. Go watch the Omen, its a superior expeirence, and make sure its the original and not the remake.  The negatives aside, the deaths were amusing once in awhile and I had more fun donig chores and exploring around the house then I had fun playing the main story.  2/10, take your money else where.

971	1	a	Quite an entertaining game. Would certainly recommend if found in a bundle or on sale. Puzzles and gameplay are fairly simplistic, but the entertainment for me came from the darkness of it. You are running around as an evil child...   A small guide or couple of play throughs with plenty of exploration is what is required. A full play through doesn't take many hours.
506	1	a	In short, Lucius is a dark little title that sees you playing as the son of Satan. You roam around your manor doing dark little deeds all in honor of your father. If you are the type of gamer who enjoys adventures games similar to the Sherlock Holmes series, and you also have a very twisted sense of humour, than this game is for you. It's not mindblowingly amazing, but it is a fun game to play when you do not fancy something very skill-based.

2809	1	a	This game is like an alien, I don't know how to describe this game in another way. XD  The graphic are not terrible ( feel like it's PS2 games ), but the characters are not that bad, I mean like York is not the most pretty character but still with time I start to like him, Emily are really cute too ^^, the animations, well sometime they are okay and many times are really weird and you feel like your are in a town of robots.  The voices are sometime not great sometime I forgot that point since I focus on what they said.  The controls are not that great.  And still if you survive all of that and you're like me and prefer to focus on the good points, I think we have a game with many good idea, you explore the town, learn about peoples around, what they do, the secret of the place. You take care of the character, eat, sleep, clean him ( shave him actually ) or his clothes ( have a night with a character with fly around because your clothes are dirty it's really weird and funny XD ). I like when York talk about movies, musics, old cases. I still don't have finish the game but I really want to know the end of this investigation.  So, I can't blame peoples who will hate this game because it's some kind of ugly for a 2013 games, but at the same times I now know what so many peoples recommend this game and me too I now recommend this game if you can deal with his 'bad' side ( 'bad' side who are for me like a bad horror movies but who are actually good because it's the style of the movie ).  A deadly premonition 2 with better graphic and animation with the good idea of this game could be a big hit I'm sure. :)

1526	0	a	Let me preface this by saying I do not think this game is bad. Homefront: The Revolution has a good foundation, and with great potential in my opinion, but almost nothing is built on it in the end.   This game is an open-world FPS title that has you play as Ethan Brady, a fresh recruit for the Resistance, fight against the KPA who hold control of Philadelphia. This game however never takes full advantage of its alternate history setting and the fact that it is an open world game. Retaking the city is pretty lackluster and repetitive. You can expect to be doing the same thing for one Zone for most of the others. You do Main missions, raise the 'Hearts &amp; Minds' percentage to 100%, do another mission to win the zone, then repeat.  I can forgive that if the rest of the game had something else to makes it stand out, but besides the weapon conversions (which are interesting, but ultimately clunky), this game has no such thing. The story is very weak, shallow, and fails to make me empathize with the Resistance. Characters lack depth and act predictably throughout the story. And while gunplay is decent, your arsenal is small and what you play with from the first zone is likely what you'll use for the rest of the game.  The final nail in the coffin for me though was how unrewarding all of it was. Most everything outside of main missions and set activities does almost nothing at all. If you killed a platoon of KPA troops nothing is gained. If you decide to capture all strongholds in a zone you only have Tech Points for changing existing weapons. All you can do is earn money, do the same activities, and finish missions. That's all the game really wants you to do.  The game can have it's moments due to the fact how you tackle each task is left for you to decide, but it's really not enough for the asking priceof $40. The game overall feels incredibly average and sometimes even below average later on in the story. Even if it's on sale I would consider looking elsewhere.  Tl;Dr - Overwhelmingly average Open-world FPS with missed potential. Not worth the price unless on (a very good) sale.
100	1	a	its an ok game.. takes a bit to get used to though
456	0	a	I have seen better games. There is only one way to kill somebody (sometimes really stupid) what is just boring. When u finish the game u have no reason to play it again what makes game really short. I think this game had very high potential but game developers ruined it.

2027	1	a	Mostly negative Really??   I know you're entitled to your opinion but come on mostly negative for this?  This game is amazing. I'm loving everything about it!!   The story is great, the gameplay is great, the weapons are great, the performance is great, the AI could be a little bit smarter but still this is a great game!  I have not witnessed any flaws I don't what the hell people are talking about bugs, I have not encountered any.   Btw I purchased this game full price and I would not complain about anything. Its worth every bit!

1595	1	a	I enjoyed this game. At first I had problems with performance but after tweaking and lowering graphic settings I got it to run about 40-60 fps when outside with minimum 30. Should also mention that my computer is below minimum requirements with GPU.   Gameplay is like all the open world games(Far Cry 3/AssAssIn Creed) - You have a map where you can run around and you must retake outposts. You can upgrade your weapons and each weapon has three configurations for example your assault rifle can be also machine gun or 20 mm rocket launcher.  Single player campaign for me was 20-21 hours with every outpost taken. Story was OK, there were some things that were interesting but most of it was expected.  I tried multiplayer and it the first impression was good, but I am not interested in multiplayer. It's coop only multiplayer.  Music was okay and I think there were 2 songs that IMO were quite good.  Flaws? Performance could have been better. More gun upgrades. There were some bugs, nothing game breaking, just visual bugs.  Conclusion: If you enjoyed Far Cry 3 and other open world games then you'll like this too.

2783	1	a	Evah emos eeffoc Kroy. Siht si a eurt egamoh ot esoht no Niwt Skaep! Ahahahahahah! There are too many flaws to this game than I can count but I guess thats the charm of it. The show its based on had numerous flaws too but thats exactly why I like it so much. Both were about failure in the face of evil although you do eventually succeed in this game. Both have well crafted characters. Grab if you are a fan of the strange. You will not be disappointed.
513	1	a	Filled with dark and creepy (dare I say ****ed up?) stuff. Enjoying this game is probably a really good reason to get your head examined which in this case is not necessarily a bad thing at all! Getting this one -75% is a steal so go for it!

1790	1	a	I liked the game it was fun and everything, and the only reason I keep playing it just because I like the revolution idea. Its a fun game (if you can run it), and it also shows america in a diffrent way and not some strong force that plows through everyone. This game is fun but if your were do like $1 a hour I would wait to have it go on sale becuase right now at the moment I don't think its worth $60 plus since it didn't sell well sadly, rip I been waiting 4-5 weeks looking for 1 player to play coop with. It should have a sale soon but my opinions is my opinion and you do w/e you think suites you best. So it had fun gameplay for me, but just wait for it to go on sale and hope you can run it. If you don't know if you can run( I assumed a lot of people know the site but for those who don't) go to this site  http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri

3103	1	a	Gameplay: Atmospheric exploration combined with clever-feeling, hard but not frustrating platforming  Content: A game world spreading over more than 1500 screens, with beautiful background art and wonderful music. A few hidden easter eggs as achievements.  Interface Design: This very simple game doesn't need a lot. Controls are arrow keys and A/S, you also have a map and item screen for informational purposes.  Sounds: Nice, relaxing but upbeat, atmospheric music. Especially of note in this game are the very carefully designed and excellent foot step and ball bouncing sound effects.  Visuals: Very small characters give a lot of importance to the surrounding environment. The walls are simple black blocks so it's easy to tell foreground from background.  Style: Quirky dialogue with some tongue-in-cheek humor. Moments of discovery and sometimes being creeped out.  Annoyances: Towards the end game, walking through a lot of already-explored areas becomes tedious and time-consuming.  Value: The game is already fairly priced at 7$, and a complete no-brainer when it goes on even a mild discount sale, if you like the genre that is.  Replayability: You'll get more or less 25 hours of exploration out of this game, after that, not much more.
1481	1	a	Bought this game on the last free weekend. Never regret buying this game. Eventhough not as bad as what the reviews said, it does still has some bugs, glitches and a few crashes. Across 26 hours of playing, i got like 7-8 crashes with 2-4 hours range for each crashes.  + Pros: - Graphic is goooood - Weapon modification is cool, the flamenwerfer is awesome and battle riffle sure packs a punch, but my fave is always smg - Open world far cry style, with minor stealth element (really really minor) - Motorbike, unfortunately, you cant kill the Norks by crashing your motorbike, they always find a way to disable your bike first - Cool gadgets, rc cars with mounted explosives is great for blowing things, besides explosives you got hacking device, firecracker,and molotov - Resistance mode is great, IMO, its better than the main game  + Cons: - The stealth, is weird, killing an enemy with suppressor weapon will alerts other enemies even after the guy died, but with crossbow, this doesnt happen - Mediocre story with some holes, like no explanation in some parts, like how did he still alive after getting that many shots and wth happened with walker - Dana Moore, she's creepy  - Hacking, meh - Crashes, 7-8 times (might be more, I didnt keep track), but never crash in Resistance mode, some minor bugs and glitches  Conclusion, I recommend this game, but get it only when its on sale. If it runs good on your rig, enjoy. If its not, refund.    
1596	1	a	Homefront The Revolution is not as bad of a game as the reviews seem to suggest. It has some good stuff such as the weapon progression, customisation, decent combat and beautiful graphics. Its essentially a FarCry 3/4 rip but has its own unique features. The problem with it is all the good only lasts 2 hours, after that it is just a reprtitive game with no incentive to finish. Games like this need a strong narrative to incentivise players to finish it. I doubt I will continue with it but for the price I got it for ($17AUD) it was definately worth it.

1687	0	a	This game wasn't too bad. This is based on my gameplay during the free weekend.   Graphics: The graphics wasn't too bad. I didnt recieve any FPS drops like other reviewers and I have a GTX 760. The detail in facial features, wet vs. dry was pretty good.   Gameplay: The gameplay wasn't the worse but it did lack storyline other than 'fight the government'. Basically you're the resistance fighting against the government thru most of the game. Each new section or you can call them chapters in the game is pretty much the same. Capture this area for communication or destroy this area to limit government supplies, etc.   Bugs: The AI was ocassionally glitchy. I was able to hide in a dumpster while KPA agents were shooting me. The AI that follow you would also block you in a corner and wouldn't move no matter what you do.... unless you reload from last checkpoint was really annoying. Certain areas of the map you could glitch it where you can sometimes get up to the next floor without going around or basically fall thru the map. There was also many times where I get stuck and wouldn't be able to move (like getting stuck between the stairs and a wall) I personally find this as a bug but it may not be but the AI can not really detect you when you're above ground level. Such as chests or radio spots above ground level.   Multiplayer: I was only about to get into 1 game. There doesn't seem to be a matchmaking system and if there is, well then people just were joining multiplayer mode.   I would rate this game 4/10. It would have to be at least 80% discounted price for me to buy it. After playing a few hours (in which like 15 was afked) I wouldn't recommend or discourage people from buying this game.
327	1	a	Awesome way to kill people. The story is common (horror movie and â¥â¥â¥â¥) but the gameplay is somehow, really good. You'll love your Uncle's perversion and be really HAPPY to kill your family and... servants. Just try it, it's really fun!

2195	1	a	I reccomend this as a SOLID shooter that will bring 10x the fun as the latest Far Cry or other of these titles that have become a tad repetitive this last season. Graphics are boosted &amp; are wonderful(even for lower end users!). There is alot here so far, although that aspect I would have to revisit upon completion as far as length and true depth. I'm actually about 8 hours in roughly, and it really feels theres lots left to do, &amp; Im hoping thats the case. Before specuilating any further on story, I mean the beginning has been exciting, but where it goes from here I'm not sure yet, but I DO feel there is enough fun here for me to reccomend. ALTHOUGH, there will be an update shortly as per full content..All in all, voted up because of how awesome it feels &amp; that everything is there that can be fun for most of us, I have set up explosives SOOO many ways, and only scratched the surface of customizations, I mean everything IS here for an awesome experience, and frankly its scratches that itch as theres really nothing else quite like it for the time being(from my perspective anyway?) You really have to play it to get it, it runs SMOOTH, I'm crossing my fingers it persists and grows on story more throughout the game, so yeh def. will be an update to this review... **Also, I should mention that I could not find a game last night(at 2am) for the co-op play, can't explain why yet, wether it was the time, or is dead already, so will update this aspect too.** But even as a single-player experience(so far) I am having fun &amp; excited to play more. **I'm STILL waiting for more gripping storyline in this game, rrgh, and well I think it was smart of them to make the AI so unpredicteable and challenging cause thats what brings me back to wanting to play more, Ive been doing a boatload of the side missions first as thats just my tendency, but seriously the last update I make to this WILL be adressing the story, as I want to be further along to be sure it soaks in before critiquing in totality. **NO MULTIPLAYER, AND DISSAPOINTING AS THE FIRST HOMEFRONT ACTUALLY HAD A REALLY FUN MP THAT WE ALL WERE HOPING TO SEE IMPROVED UPON FOR THIS RELEASE, I MEAN THATS WHAT WE ALL WERE THINKING, AND WAITING FOR. THIS IS VERY SAD** THE MULTIPLAYER IN THIS VERSION IS BROKEN, &amp; ID ACTUALLY LOVE FOR THEM TO OPEN THIS TO MODDING OR DO A FULL MULTIPLAYER RELEASE THEMSELVES, A HUGELY MISSED OPPERTUNITY TO IMPRESS THE FANS, LIKE I SAID, SAD. THE STORY TURNED OUT TO BE MEDIOCRE, NOTHING REALLY CHANGES OR HAPPENS THAT LEAVES AN IMPACT. FELT A TAD RUSHED &amp; AS IF THINGS ARE MISSING, I ALMOST FEEL I WAS TOO EXCITED AT THE BEGINNING, THEN IT FELL MORE FLAT.. OVERALL GOOD, NOT FANTASTIC, LOOK FOR A SALE..

3671	1	a	 Early Access Review
2156	1	a	So I went into this game almost completely blind, my friend and I were looking for a game to play together and didnât find anything until I found this game. We waited until this game came out and bought it on release. We were reading the comments about how optimization was poor and how it was slow and lagging and etc. We both have very good computers and both of us were able to successfully load the game. As with many newer games you may need a decent computer. The graphics are impressive, and neither him or me experienced major issues concerning it lagging. This game has a really promising multiplayer although the story fell a bit flat. The multiplayer, in my opinion, is the best part of the game and I loved it for the first four(ish) hours. The small amount of maps limits the playability of the game since there isnât a lot of different ways to play each map. Let me just say that this is a really fun multiplayer game with some interesting missions. The problem is there are what six maps, maybe seven? Half are based on offense and the others are defensive. I already payed $60 for this game, why do I have to pay about $6 for more maps that probably are the same type of missions. A lot of people are complaining about the bad AI, I disagree. The AI is pretty good at spotting you (and killing you). We only encountered a dead body glitching through a wall. In the multiplayer the enemies aren't always positioned in the same space when you start, and I really enjoyed that added challenge.  What I really don't enjoy about multiplayer other than the limited maps and somewhat repetitive missions, is that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ lady on the coms. 'What's the hold up!' 'What's the hold up!' Oh, I don't know? Maybe the two tanks that just rolled in? Constantly annoying me when I don't speed through a level. She is the Navi of Homefront. This also brings up another point, the game doesnât want you to stealth. The knife killing animations are awesome, like oh my God watching another player knife an unsuspecting soldier is cool. So naturally, we wanted to try to do missions in stealth. After trying to sneak, we realized something: this game doesn't want you to sneak. Sure the snipers are easy targets for your knife, but on the ground, where you are most of the time, you have limited stealth options. No sneak rolling/running or anything that's common in games that want to provide a stealth option. Well you may be asking, 'well Guy Fieri this game isnât meant for stealth, itâs about guns!' To that I would reply with saying that the game wanted to provide a guerrilla style warfare that is common in American war history. A part of it is sneaking. Also, in your skill tree you can pick up several sneak related skills like not being seen as easily by enemies. Why give me that skill when I can't get a silencer until I buy x amount of crates (which I suggest focusing on getting weapons and armor before attachments) and as soon as I fire every single enemy in the entire universe knows exactly where I am? This limits the ways to play their small selection of maps. Also another problem, that i'm sure a little later won't be a problem, I can't seem to find any servers? There is a story, and admittedly I havenât played a bunch, but what I have played is average. Unskippable, boring cutscenes giving me unwanted explanations of the situation are the first ten minutes of the game. Then*spoilers* the two people you are with die. Walker gets arrested, and you go to the main resistance in the area. They get mad at you when you fall into their well marked tunnel and start beating you up before asking for authentication? No, iâm sorry you are the worst tunnel keeper in history.*end spoiler.* Again this is just the beginning maybe it gets better later, there are better people to talk about the story than me. I do recommend this game though, like I said the multiplayer is fun. One thing I find very impressive is that for the multiplayer to feel fun you donât need another friend. Your mic is always on which I think gives a realness to the game. After taking away the good graphics, there is a good game. The gun mechanics are good and I really like the skill tree and the way you obtain weapons and gear. I think what would make the multiplayer better is obviously adding more maps for free, but also opening up areas for mass multiplayer games like a team deathmatch and capture the flag. Also I wish that in multiplayer and the main story we were able to customize our character, and I donât mean picking from a few female characters and a few male characters. Overall 7/10.
2659	1	a	Deadly Preminition is a bizzare game. On paper, it's not that impressive. Dated graphics, awkward gameplay, stiff animations, lack of creature design, various audio and visual bugs to boot. But still there's some charm reminiscent of the David Lynch series Twin Peaks, including a protaganist that feels very influenced by the series itself. I can't really say much more without spoiling some of wackyness and weirdness that goes on within the game itself however.   The Japanese historically haven't had a good time with PC ports (As consoles are the dominant market in Japan) and this game is no different. With repeated reports of not opening (Simple fix, go into your DP files and delete the one for PhysX) and audio and visuals not matching up, but Durante has released some fixes for the game. Which help it a lot with visual resolutions and some of the massively gamebreaking bugs.  It has tons of charm, a great soundtrack and a few moments of 'What the â¥â¥â¥â¥' Worth playing for curiosity alone but I'd wait for a sale on it.
2145	1	a	This game is a fun labor of love. Yes it had some of the usual glitches that have been my experience with cry enging games however what has been the draw for me is the story telling in the Homefront series and I thought that was pretty good. I am left left wondering how much better it could have been without all the set backs. The background small things were a good way to immerse you in this crappy situation that the characters are placed in. The weapon system and the way the different ways to go about every situation felt fun and kept things different as you start to retake the city. I look forward to playing with others.
1887	0	a	I don't know what it is with this game, but between the aiming, interface, story, voice acting, and the lack of optimization I just couldn't enjoy this game. I played about 30 minutes and then sent in a refund request. I was hoping this would be something like the Metro series, but in a different universe; Sadly, it was just a script written by a bunch of high school interns.....................

1725	0	a	Ok so let's talk about this game, this won't take long.   I was a big fan of the first Homefront even if it was a little generic. When this game was first announced I thought it had promise but as things progressed I started to get worried. In any case I picked it up and have played a few hours and I just can't play  anymore...why?  Is it bad, is it glitchy? Well no to the first question and maybe a little to the second question.  The big issue is that it's just soooooo generic and repetitive. The graphics are ok and I need to give the rain kudos for being some of the best rain in gaming, honestly the rain actually makes individual drops on the ground and things get wet in real time, it looks amazing! However when the best thing you can say about the game is the rain effects then you know it has problems.  The story makes little sense and gives you no reason to care about anything or anyone, the level designs are hollow boring sandboxes and the shooting is intially weak and wimpy. Things get better as you upgrade weapons but the problem is other than some strong enemies the gameplay never varies. It is like a standard sandbox game where you go to 'X' and press 'Y' to capture an area. Rinse and repeat over and over. There is some mindless catharsis in this but after a couple of hours it gets boring. Part of me wants to keep playing because there is a little fun to sniping enemy patrols but when you go from one generic city block to the next that fun quickly evaporates after 20 mins or so.  I didn't get any major bugs while playing but there were a lot of clipping errors during cutscenes and generally rough edges.  All in all it's an average shooter with bland level design and a â¥â¥â¥â¥ poor story that makes it difficult to play for longer than 15-20 mins at a time.  5/10

My fav mode to play is Slaughter (survival) where the zombies keep coming which also has an online scoreboard to challenge your friends. Story mode is repetitive and gets pretty boring; there is a lot of content for the money though! Blood Racing is OK but most enjoyable once you get a good ride. Decent array of weaponry &amp; cars to choose from which are all upgradable (off course :p).         Aussiedroid's ZD:HD Players Handbook&nbsp;

2026	1	a	Good game but with some real game faults !!!  - FPSÂ´s in the game are a real mess, with average from 15fps on a real confrontation battle and 70fps on quiet places  (running on Asus GTX 980Ti 6GDDR5, I7 3770K 4.1GHz, 16GB DDR3). - CanÂ´t customize all weapons (ex: I cantÂ´put silencer on M4 or Shotgun).  - Enemy respawn is at your sight (they just appear on front of you).
2456	1	a	Inquisitor is a detailed RPG with a riveting storyline based in the medieval period following the infamous black plague. It uses a mix of real world events and common fantasy elements to recreate the era. Fantasy elements include magic, enchanted weaponry, and useful alchemical potions (real world alchemy was actually an endless pursuit to try and create gold by mixing various elements).   One of my favorite historical elements is a mention of the flagellants, a group of christian extremists who repeatedly whipped themselves and inflicted other bodily harm in an attempt to recreate the suffering of Jesus. Of course, the most apparent historical element is the inquisition itself, referring to the persecution of all those who weren't inline with the beliefs of the church. This game is of course not nearly as extreme and vulgar as what actually took place, but I won't go too far in detail, as I don't want to bore you with a history lesson.  So, what's good?  -Leveling system with XP, attributes, skill points -Large variety of spells and skills (all explained by detailed tooltips) -Lots of equipment (character can equip weapon, shield, helm, armor, boots, gloves, belt, two rings, and an amulet) -Challenging combat -Choices with consequences -Good replay value (to try different choices with different consequences) -Immersive world -Non-linear gameplay -Intriguing storyline  What can be annoying?  -Bosses are extremely difficult, to the point where you may have to clear several areas without fighting the bosses, and then go back and try again, and again, clear some other areas, and then try again. Although, it kind of makes sense from a realistic point of view, as most of these are all fabled in the lore to be as such. It's still annoying. -Old school RPG with archaic graphics -No tutorial, which can make it frustrating to figure out how to play, especially if you are not familiar with how these types of games work. -All text, no voice dialogue  What can be viewed either way?  -No flashing marker on your map telling you where to go next, forcing you to actually pay attention to dialogue if you want to complete quests (time to drag out the old notepad). -Character growth in spells and skills is limited by your class choice, forcing you to specialize. While this adds some to the replay value, it doesn't allow one to create that god-like character that can do anything.  In conclusion, this game can be great but is not for everyone.  If your one of those who doesn't like reading, this game may not be for you. If you like games to be easy, this game is likely not for you, as you will have to do some thinking. If you are one of those who can't stand to look at a game if it doesn't have modern graphics, then this game is DEFINITELY not for you.  That said, I think this game is absolutely amazing. I'm sure that if you are an avid RPG gamer like myself who can tolerate the old school style and difficult bosses, you will love it as much as I do. At U.S. $9.99, Inquisitor is a steal.

2429	0	a	At first glance, this game holds a lot of promise... looks like it will be heaps of fun for people who enjoyed the Far Cry franchise. Sadly, it completely fails to live up to expectations...  1. There are a heap of clipping problems. Enemies see you through walls. In some places, enemies walk through walls. Things and people sink into floors. Some items you need to gather are unreachable because the buggy clipping stops them from falling into your reach. 2. Weird AI. Its like it was engineered to be annoying. You know those enemies that somehow miraculously know to duck when you target them with your sniper rifle? And then jump out of cover if you turn your back on them - when you're completely behind cover and they can't possibly see that you've turned your back. After a couple of hours, I started to use this technique to draw enemies out of cover. Its kind of funny making enemies dance by pointing a sniper rifle at them - watching them lurch from side to side to avoid the sniper's line of fire. 3. Scripting glitches. Some of the missions become impossible to complete because of some lazy scripting on the part of the programmers. 4. Infinite enemies. I've always been challenged by whether a game should have reasonable 'reinforcements' mechanics - but in this game, well... its just more lazy coding. Enemies randomly spawn infinitely. The programmers tried to cut some code so that enemies don't spawn where you're looking - but they screwed that up too.  After many hours of persisting in the hopes that things would get better, I'm abandoning it.

3038	1	a	If you've ever played or enjoyed any of Nifflas's other games, you will probably both enjoy and feel familiar in this one. (And if you haven't, Within A Deep Forest and Knytt Stories are both freeware, so go play them). And I don't just say that because your characters control like the two from those games. However, this is not just 'more of the same', and does see him treading new ground.  Gameplay is exploration heavy and very atmospheric. Many areas have puzzles or hazards like enemies and lava, and in some cases (mostly in secret levels) those can be quite difficult. However, those are not the focus of the game, and many other areas there's only platforming or even no obstacles at all. You don't gain permanent powerups, but areas may have objects that give you temporary abilities. Emphasis is on the scenary and atmosphere instead, and on the story.  Yes, the story. And that's the new ground: The story here is very good. You spend most of the game with two companions with layered personalities and backstories, and can choose which one of them will talk for you with most NPCs. As you explore you'll uncover more of their backstory along with the mute protagonist's. The story defies a lot of genre conventions; quests don't always end in a way the characters find satisfying (though they usually do), people are occasionally unable or unwilling to compensate you, and ultimately a lot of doubt is cast on the claim that your quest to 'save the world' is actually doing anything. Combined with the unusual backstories and themes, it is a pretty unique experience.  The game becomes extremely nonlinear once you beat the introductory chapters. You can explore in any direction as far as you want, and the world is huge, but if you want you can 'beat' the game before seeing huge portions of it. There's also tons of secret rooms and levels, both within the game world and accessible from exploring the menu/hub world.  Overall, I'd highly recommend trying this game. Just don't expect any aspect of it to be fast paced.

However it's not, it's dull, it crashed twice on me, audio failed miseribly and gunplay is sorely lacking, sadly I cannot get a refund, as I did not buy through Steam and have clearly used my code, I do not suggest you buy this game, at least not yet.

2189	0	a	Loved the first Homefront. Fighting outside a lumber liquidators with a modern enviroment was awsome. Now move onto the second game and it falls completly short. Not only can you tell the game has been passed around from studio to studio but it seems as each studio got ahold of the game they tried to cram in there special bland style. The games mechanics are dated and poor. The future tech is boring an overused. All the second game needed to do was pick up where the first one left off. The copy of every ubisoft go here kill bad guys and activate outpost is dated and boring at this point. The guns are a total let down compared to the first game. The second Homefront is a step backwards in almost every way. The devlopers took no time to add something new to the game and advance the series forward. Half the time I dont think anyone on the dev team even played the orginal game.  This is probbly the death of the homefront series and that is sad becuase a fight for Americas indapenence red dawn type game is something that is not done very often or done well. Very unexplored genre.

1618	1	a	I bought Homefront: The Revolution when it launched, so I did see the glitches and bugs that people were complaining about. But now the game runs silky smooth!  Content wise there's plenty to do - Capture KPA Strongholds, rescue resistance fighters, highjack armoured convoys - there's always something cool to do!  It's actually really fun to get all the radios, bike stashes, capture all Strikepoints etc.  The multiplayer is really good aswell, but the singleplayer is where it shines. It's nice to play with a beer after a hard day at work.

1143	1	a	This game is hard as a Mofo. It's very confusing (you need a walkthrough because stuff just isnt obv.) Maybe im just horrible and stupid? PROBABLY :p. The graphics are nice, its not crisis but its surprisingly pleasing to look at and runs great on maxed settings. I'd say its a mixture of a puzzle game and a horror/supernatural thriller mystery? Yeah that works. I wouldnt pay the full $10 but on sale it's a great addition and lasts around 6-10 hours. :) I give it a 7/10.

339	1	a	This title quickly rocketed up to one of my favorite games of the last decade; itâs not flawless, itâs not a blockbuster or a triple A spectacle, but Lucius is exceptionally different, well executed and darkly captivating. I feel that itâs fair to assume that revealing your character to be an evil, twisted little demon child does not merit a spoiler warning. Lucius (even his name is evil) is an extremely rare phenomena of a character; even though he is the main character and you play as him, he is the single most horrifying part of playing this game. Obviously there are no jump scares since you are the one in control of him, but what is terrifying is how easily this fictional child brings out this dark evil personality from the player. The core of the game is a point and click murder mystery with the awesome twist that youâre the âbad guyâ and your goal is to not get caught. The mansion that the story takes place in is a bit confusing when you first started, and the map is pretty unexceptional, but after the first couple chapters youâll quickly get a hang of how itâs all laid out. Some of the optional quest objectives can be a bit tedious but the main missions are relatively easy to work your way through without feeling hopelessly stuck. The atmosphere is perfect, starting out peaceful and opulent then progressively sliding into emotional turmoil and fear. Lucius is absolutely incredible and I would recommend it to anyone.

915	1	a	Lucius us a good game. It's a great stress reliever, the deaths were pretty amusing (morbidly amusing), and it had enough content that you could take a while to beat the game. There were bugs that made levels impossible to finish and forced you to restart the entire chapter (Chapter 13 specifically, using telekinesis on a certain item could cause it to fall in a place where you couldn't get it again. I had to restart it five times), and sometimes it was overly difficult for no reason (Chapter 10 specifically, sneaking through the mansion if you don't get the glue before you start the mission is god awful), but overall, I really enjoyed the game.

351	1	a	The next time you go to church and the preacher tells you that video games are evil, you can look him in the eye and tell him.......er....uh......Well, since this game's release, there's really no good counter argument. LOL Yep, in this game you play as the son of the devil. It is heavily influnced by the 1976 classic 'Omen,' and that honestly is the only thing that initially attracted me to this game. It's a third person mystery/adventure game where you explore a huge mansion and find creative ways to kill off the help. You do not play a hero. If this game has any heros at all, it's the detective and your clueless parents. The chapters of the game are divided into each person you kill, and with each murder, your satanic powers are increased. You get such skills as mind control, combustion, and memory erase. You can move things with your mind and set people on fire, but you can't be seen because you don't want to draw suspicion. The story is progressed through very good cutscenes told between chapters and the game has a lot of atmosphere. The story reaches it's climax during a very cool exorcism scene, but man I've never played a game where I wanted the character I play as to loose so bad. It's a very interesting twist that honestly, I wasn't totally comfortable with. But it was original, unique, and very interesting, with great controls and a neat open world mansion to explore. So if you don't mind taking the role of a devil child and knocking off helpless people for Satan, this might be your cup of tea. BWAHAHAHAHAHAAA!!
1823	0	a	Alot of people thinks that homefront 1 was a â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. Which i DO NOT agree with. The story was 'meh' but the multiplayer was alot of fun.  But heres the problem. First of all this game does not have multiplayer like in homefront 1, only 'coop'. And the frame rate is horribble. I had big hopes about this game but nah. I do not recommend this
1007	0	a	good idea, poorly executed. often difficult to navigate. buggy when it comes to retention of items, progress, events, etc. poor writing and mostly poor voice acting. ending is sudden and unsatisfying, partially due to poor pacing. that said, there are definitely some cool moments scattered throughout. on occasion, the mood and environment line up just right and one has to give credit for the creativity of some of the kills. unfortunately, the puzzles are usually overly simplistic or counterintuitive and the dark atmosphere and gory spectacles seem forced at times. i could mention several specific gripes, but the first example that comes to mind is    when lucius gains the power to control fire. lucifer specifically says 'now, you don't need matches!' immediately after this, the player must light candles with matches to advance.    when combat, precision, speed, stealth, etc. are involved, the game falls short and irrevocably spoils the decent bits. cool at first glance but overall a sophomoric effort. the best part was picking up    pornographic videos and trying to show my prized copy of 'â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ hunters' to my parents and housemates.   
2585	1	a	Picked this up for Â£2 during a sale, didn't expect much. Had to patch it and apply several weird fixes before it would run, and it kept crashing randomly. Even with a controller, the movement was a bit clunky, and the graphics are straight from 2005.  Despite all of that, Deadly Premonition is probably my favourite game of 2016. After sticking with it for a bit, the story becomes incredibly immersive, the characters you meet are funny and eccentric, and you can't help but fall in love with the game. The story is genuinely intriguing, and all the weird quirks (getting paid to peep into people's houses, stuffing your face with an endless supply of lollipops, main character's oddball rants) make the game even better.   Protips: - Only pick this up if you care about story in games. It's Deadly Premonition's strongest suit ... but also pretty much the only one. If you like story-rich RPGs, you will love this. - Don't take this game too seriously at the beginning.  - Play with a controller, it makes everything much more manageable. - Patch the game before you start!

Got it for the free weekend and honestly, if I'd have had the money I would have bought it in the sale to replay it at some point. The game's actually solid, even if the weapon system is restricting (Not a fan of the games that give you one type of assault rifle and have that whole kit swapping thing). The biggest draw for me was that you felt like an actual revolutionary, using hit and run attacks on KPA officials in their convoys, subtly killing lone soldiers dumb enough to walk on the back streets with no backup, and dismantling the propaganda machines. I loved using the molotovs in the game, observing KPA patrols and then tossing a molotov into the middle of them and bolting before they figured out what'd happened.  I enjoyed it, I'd recommend it while it was on sale.

2561	1	a	let's get started...  Good thigs about this video game: 1. Main story is a masterpiece full of mystery and weird things. (Greenvale town is a strange place) 2. The characters are so spectacular you can find crazy guys, tough guys even a horny Woman who try to seduce you. 3. Side quest mission are so funny.  Bad things about this video game: 1. The graphics looks like 128-bit era.  2. Bad really bad pc port sometimes crash over and over again and you need to restart your computer.  3. Only 720p is this a joke ?? but don't worry you can solve it with DPfix.  So if you like video games like resident evil or similars (survival horror games) I can tell you this you will enjoy this one just like me off course you must have a lot of patience because you know the glitches about this game can be a pain in the â¥â¥â¥ so I hope this little review may help you

The AI are like â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ children, (Running all the time, trying to run through a solid wall, talking needlessly all the time.) The game suffers from frequent frame drops, the guns feel weightless and have absolutely no character to them, the characters themselves are easily forgettable, not relatable, and serve no purpose other than to create a 'story' which you as the player most often feel un-attatched to.   Apart from the awful gameplay and awful characters, the setting itself is alright, the usage of cryengine really allows for beautiful lighting, and very atmospheric settings.  I rate this game a 3 out of 10, for beautiful environments, but absolutely horrendous gameplay.

491	0	a	4.9/10 the devil is in the detail. Hmmm. This game really shows the good and bad of indie game production.  On the one hand it's a unique and interesting game concept, the sort of thing which the big guys would shy away from. On the other hand, it's not very well executed, and there are a number of bugs and glitches.  On the one hand, the story is pretty well put together, and not just dashing off another sequel, on the other hand, the game does become a little linear, with very few actual choices (you have to play for the kill in the cutscene, even when your twisted mind can see something better.)  It  is  fun and engaging, and easy to get the hang of, but when you open a drawer and it passes through a chair, people talk to you through walls, or you pass somebody on the stairs and end up riding on their head and looking through the ceiling, it breaks your immersion. Give it a go by all means, but don't expect too much.

370	0	a	 Check Out my Full Review for Lucius Here!  [uncrownedreview.blogspot.com]   This game is just riddled with problems. It styles itself as a sort of logic puzzle game but the problem is, you don't have half the pieces to the puzzles. You have to find the pieces by trial and error to eventually solve the puzzles and murder your entire household.  Look at my avatar, it's holding an axe. When I successfully use puzzles to murder someone I should be clapping gleefully in a way that makes the FBI agents attached to monitor me feel very uncomfortable. I should not be feeling like my own brain is beginning to melt inside my skull to the point that I actually thought on the level of insanity of the developers.   A walkthrough is pretty much required for this game and I'm told that if you just want the story you can watch a movie called The Omen and save yourself the time. If you can get it on sale for under $5 there are some fun missions that you'll enjoy playing. I don't recommend it for any more than that unless the developers release a major overhaul.

2068	1	a	Homefront holds up pretty well, plays a lot like a âcapture the baseâ game, but on the medium difficulty mobs are a bit bullet-sponge-y while the player dies super quickly. Also, there is almost zero bullet-tracing so tracking shots is very hard. Crossbow bolts get stuck on all sorts of invisible things :(  Also, when you get spotted by the zepplins you have about 20-30 seconds to get into a safe-haven or else you will certainly die, plus even if you get back to a compound you own, it will still be under assault (though the enemy will never re-capture it)

729	0	a	Lucius is an unpolished game with a unique setting. The game is totally linear and there is no freedom to try different things. It's no Hitman. It plays more like a point'n click game so there is absolutely no challenge at all once you know what to do. The puzzles were either very easy or just frustrating imo. I wouldnât call any of them âchallengingâ.  I ran into some bad AI interactions and minor bugs as well. The npcs repeated the same lines over and over again and they often spoke on top of each other. Towards the end it got annoying to hear Nancy (the main characterâs mom) constantly ask you to do laundry when I had already completed the chore very early on. The game crashed a few times and one time I clipped through the staircase wall to the outside of the manor. I also ran into many minor flaws which made the game feel unpolished.  Still, it was a somewhat enjoyable experience and worth the 1,89â¬ I paid for it. In my opinion you should only consider buying Lucius if itâs on big sale and the premise sounds interesting to you.

2799	1	a	absolutely fantastic.  Everything about this game walks a fine line of self awareness. Things don't always make sense at first, but it pays off by the end.  I recommend playing it with a controller, it makes combat much much easier. This game has a reputation as a so bad it's good game. Strangely, by the end it became a just good game. York is a magnificently engaging character, and all the supporting cast is various levels of endearing. It's wonderful.  Be sure to do all the side missions! Just doing the quest is okay but there's a lot of payoff by helping the towns people.

486	0	a	This is an amusing game, but a very limited game. Obviously the graphics aren't the main draw, though they're serviceable. The main issue with this game is it's simplicity. I was hoping for a bit more openness, but it's a rigid storyline with rigid goals and only one way to do things. And it's not always clear what you should do.  Add to that an ending which is lackluster due to poor aiming controls and a cramped little arena, capped with an obscure final moment and it falls flat.  That's not to say the game isn't worth a little time and a little money. I picked it up for $2 during a sale and I don't feel I wasted my money. It is entertaining. Just not worth dropping too much green on it in my opinion.

2270	1	a	I love the game but LOTS OF BUGS!!!! Every few seconds the game freezes and then in like a second its fine bu does this the entire time your playing the game. I know its not the PC because my brother has the game on the PS4 and it does the same thing... Once this is fixed the game will be even better. I under stand the game came out a week ago but still you have enough time to fix these bugs in the game. Please FIX THIS!!!!!
2389	0	a	Now, i enjoy playing this game, but its filled with bugs. I enjoy the combat, the takedown animations and the gurilla style warfare. But damn, so many flaws. There are points in this game, where you think 'What the **** is going on?'. It can be from the AI bugging out, not spotting you, the fact that you are the only one required to wear a gasmask at a certain point and so on.... Logic has been thrown out the window completly with this game. But still, i enjoy the game. Even though its rage inducing. I dont recommend buying it!
2395	0	a	  Finished the single player during the free weekend, which for all the claims of being 'fixed' still suffered from several serious technical issues such as:  *Horrendous mouse input lag (200+ms) until I turned off supersampling (despite flawless frame rate thanks to my 1080GTX) *various GUI errors, keyboard prompts being replaced with joypad ones for no apparent reason for the duration of a mission *hard crash between missions that caused save corruption (clicking resume at the main menu after restarting the game did nothing, had to manually reload the previous autosave to continue)  Still, while the single player was mediocre at best at least I got through it.   Co-op on the other hand is completely broken right now. Cannot join a single game, so there is no reason to buy it after the free weekend ends.

1805	1	a	Great game actually, unexpected.  Not the grindy Far Cry style open world, instead a relatively short 'do what you want' for some hours, more focus on others. If you like Far Cry, Mad Max, Crysis, Stalker this game is probably for you.  If you try this game out do not be discouraged by the bad and boring start, wait until you at least get into the yellow (civilian zone) after an hour or two since that is the real deal and makes the game what it is.  Ran without bugs, very smooth.

The narrative is good but its not great because you can't turn of subtitles and the voice actors are not that great. The murders are good but sometimes they don't always make sense. Sometimes their straightforward and you have no problems. Other times you can't figure them out and your forced to use a walkthrough. A shame the sequel to this game didn't turn out. This game could really use a re do to make better graphics and more lines of dialogue with better voice actors. Still, its good for 8 hours of fun.

2231	1	a	Finished with the Game. Now for the review.  With all people say about it you may be inclined to think negatively as well, but this game, is a work of marvel.  Pros: Unique story True to the guerrilla way Feels like a revolution Awesome graphics Massive map Gun edit on the go Good multiplayer   Cons: Many, Many Glitches Some of the aforementioned glitches can hook story Shooting isn't very lively Frame rate drops when saving The realistic story removes action, for those action lovers, pass on it.   Basically speaking, the game takes a different route, and is definately worth playing, but if you think you'd rather wait till patches are made or you do not like games without much action, pass on it. After seeing the IGN review for this game I lost all respeck for IGN rreview system. They rate the game like its meant to be COD MW3 when it is it's own kind of unique.   P.s: if u get stuck in a part where a glitch gets you, remember if you go to story you can load a previous session

570	1	a	Whether you might find Lucius worth picking up can quickly be deduced by whether the basic concept sounds like it could carry a game for you. Playing as the son of the devil you utilize a number of psychic powers and everyday household objects in specific situations to orchestrate a series of unlikely and over-the-top âaccidentsâ (murders). Does that sound fun and like something you could do for 6-8 hours? Then come on board. But if youâre expecting it to be more than that, or if you were hoping for a sandbox experience that lets you decide how to use those powers then you probably wonât get what you want out of it.   Itâs of great importance to note that Lucius is less Bully/Saints Row and more Monkey Island/Mystâ¦justâ¦with more murder. Yes thatâs right despite appearances this is for all intents and purposes a real-time, fully 3D, point-and-click adventure. Things are rarely action oriented, instead forcing you to locate a number of items and utilize them in the correct location alongside a host of generic powers such as telekinesis and mind-control to arrange your targets untimely demise. Essentially being your average adventure game puzzles wrapped up in a macabre aesthetic.  This wasnât a negative to me, but if you were hoping to be let loose in a world where you could unleash your powers on a whim in any way you could dream of youâll be disappointed. In fact, itâs quite the opposite with a few exceptions and if you use your powers outside of the areas theyâre allowed youâll likely receive a game over. Since part of the story is remaining undetected and making the murders look like accidents or shifting the blame on to someone else youâll lose the game if someone catches you lighting things on fire with your mind or the like. Thereâs some leniency there and itâs not so strict as to be aggravating, but it does limit what you can do. Even in the areas youâre meant to use your abilities you have to figure out the exact way the developers intended for you to use them to solve the puzzle and cause the murder. Again this will be a negative for some, but on the opposite end it does allow some of the murders to be really excessive and over the top since you can cause things you could never have orchestrated on your own.  It does however highlight one of the big problems I have with the game. Some of the powers feel pointless and you can really see this when some of them are only used once or twice in the entire game. For instance a power you get later in the game is pyrokinesis, the ability to create and control fire with your mind. At first this seems really neat but the game quickly comes up against its own wall. Since youâre supposed to be stealthy and subtle there really isnât much use for this ability outside of two places where itâs shoehorned in. And of course using it anywhere else immediately gets you noticed and get a game over. Telekinesis and mind-control are used rather frequently, but otherwise the other powers feel throw-away and serve little purpose.   The secondary game mechanic is the occasional stealth bit. Usually you get to âhide in plain sightâ by virtue of being a child. But a couple missions call for sneaking around the house after dark. These are pretty simple as long as you keep your wits about you and watch the patrolling guardsâ flashlights. This also shows off another useless ability in the form of âmemory eraseâ which is supposed to be there to quickly make people forget they saw minor things such as you wandering around after dark or levitating objects. You can use it only a few times a mission but itâs more than enough to make the stealth situations criminally easy, and even then I had to use it a grand total of one time. Still these sections have some very nice lighting and are quite ambient.  There are some sidequests in the form of âchoresâ such as taking out the trash, doing laundry, and helping people find valuables they misplaced. Yes, that really is as boring as it sounds but it serves an interesting point in that it makes you look like a normal child. As the game continues on and more-and-more people die everyone begins doubting each other, especially you. But if you keep up the act of appearing normal their reactions are less extreme. I donât know if they figure you out if you donât do the chores since I always did them, or if their dialogue just changes, but either way it was a nice touch. Bonus points for you getting âgiftsâ for doing enough of the chores, though only one in the form of a tricycle that lets you move around faster is of any real use.   Aesthetically the game is very nice. From an actual graphical stand-point itâs an average looking game, being neither great nor terrible. But a Gothic Victorian setting with a very carefully crafted and detailed house to explore makes the graphics themselves a non-factor, as the architecture and degree of detail present is fun to look at regardless. A muted color scheme, hazy filter, and a perpetually dreary skyline punctuate and bring the macabre, grim setting to life. This is laid against the backdrop of some rather creepy old-timey Vaudeville inspired music that fits the setting perfectly.   Most of the games bugs are graphics based so Iâll stick them here. The game doesnât have any truly game-breaking bugs but it does have a host of minor hiccups like characters teleporting a few feet, physics enabled objects getting stuck and âstretchingâ across the screen, characters getting hung-up on doorways, and some funky hit-detection. Again nothing game breaking, but some atmosphere breaking stuff to be sure if thatâs enough to turn you away from buying it.   Story-wise things work but are nothing special. Did you ever want to play the Omen as a game taken wholesale? Well thatâs what youâre going to get. Though at times it seems like the game canât decide if it wants to be The Omen word-for-word, or The Omen with some parody tossed in. For the most part itâs played completely straight but a few scenes and characters seem like they are there almost as a joke. Not a âHa haâ laugh out loud funny joke, but a sort of pervasive dark humor. Some might enjoy this but for me it felt out of place because most of the game takes itself so seriously. Additionally the ending feels rushed, it comes out of nowhere and is more than a little underwhelming. I got enough fun out of the rest of the game to forgive it, but the last few chapters feel like they had half of the time and work put into them being shorter, easier, and not requiring nearly the same level of mental thought to solve the puzzles.  Overall I enjoyed Lucius and I think thereâs a lot to come here for. But the game isnât without issue both from a design and technical standpoint. If you come in expecting a game where you get to cause some over-the-top murders from the role of son of the devil youâll probably be entertained by what you get, but if youâre expecting a revolutionary experience or some unknown gem of a game youâll likely not find what you wanted.

I managed to get it working by going into the games redist folder and running the PhysX_SystemSoftware exe in it and ran the vcredist_x86 exe. seems to work good so far.

2607	1	a	To get it out of the way first, the PC port is pretty damn bad, even with DPFix. Unlike the Dark Souls port which was good (no new bugs, old bugs fixed, solid FPS, it runs, etc.), this port is falling apart at the seams. There's old bugs, new bugs, plenty of crashes, and what have you.  However, the core of the game's story, ie: the characters, the setting, the story, the mystery, is just so god damn solid that I was willing to overlook the PC port issues. There's just something to the overall charm of these things that makes it easy to overlook the issues. In fact, some of the issues feel like they add to the game. The janky animations, the poorly balanced voice clips, the comically bad car handling, and some other oddities seem to just fit so well with the game.  Even with all it's issues, this is a great game!

2099	1	a	Homefront: The Revolution is an 'open-world fps' with some cool weapon conversions that change the way your guns behave and of course....maim your foes(KPA). And the game is just....Solid. Its not that great and its not that good. I have played for about 8 hours and cleared about half of the game. While the game is advertized as an open world game, it is actually more like open world segments that you can fast travel to and from. The story is pretty standard as fps games go. The characters are not that great, and your player character is silent. You take outposts held by the KPA and earn money for new attachments, weapons and gear to improve your silent character. Honestly it feels alot like Farcry,but with a slight post-invasion like feel. The graphics are quite nice on a GTX 960, and i dont really have any really bad bugs to talk about. Ign posted saying enemies just popping in, Ive never had that problem. As stated before the game is nothing to write home about. I was very stoked for this game when it was revealed, but now i am slightly dissapointed by the final product. The game is still fun with all of its weapon customization and solid fps gameplay, but the story is lacking. I was also dissapointed by the fact that there is no competitive multiplayer, however there is a coop mode but there is only about 6 missions that you can do as of now. And there not very intresting to say the least.  Overall i give the game a 6/10  Im only recommending because there is no 'Meh' option. I am enjoying the game thus far but its just a solid game. Ill play it for maybe another 15-20 hours then uninstall and let it sit in my library.

Note that I have only played the game for about an hour so I don't know if this goes away. I just stopped looking at the map altogether.  With that said, if you're looking for a game where you play a character like Damien from the movie The Omen, this nails it.

870	1	a	So what is this game about; you are playing as the son of devil 'Lucius' and in every chapter you have to kill one person in a specific way. There are 18 or 19 chapters. I liked the cutscenes also, everytime you kill someone there is a cutscene. I had a few glitches and at the beginning i wasted like hour because i couldnt see my mouse on the screen. I couldnt play this game full screen, so i had to window it. Sometimes i had to restart the game because it glitched on some parts. I got stuck to walls and objects if i was near them, but it only happened like 2 or 3 times. I am fan of horror and adventure games, so i love it. I like the surroundings, i like the mansion, i like the characters of the game and i love the soundtrack also. Even tho i had few glitches and problems, i gave this a recommend because i think people who like horror or adventure games may like this game also, as i did. &lt;:

1563	0	a	Edited to include control method**  I always struggle to decide whether or not to pre-order. This is one of those times when I wish I hadn't.  The gameplay is actually fun if you're not looking for insane Action RPG style life ruining immersion, and it's a pretty great shooter with some fun mechanics (hacking, and modding weapons comes to mind in the first 2 hours I've so far played).  The trouble lies in what everyone else is saying too; which is that it's thus far very poorly optimized.  Running at 1440P.  System Specs: i7 6700K OC'ed to 4.7ghz EVGA GTX 980Ti FTW 6GB 16gigs of Vengeange LPX RAM at 3000mhz Controlled with M+KB (Corsair K70 RGB / Razer Deathadder)   And this game stutters and stumbles it's way through almost every graphical setting I've tried thus far. Maybe it will perform better once a patch or two is released but for now, for the price, it's a title that I think has a lot of promise. If you know what the game is going to be about. It might impress. Just wait a week or two to buy it.

2996	1	a	An obscure game known for being the most polarizing horror game ever, Deadly Premonition delivers a memorable experience. Despite bargain bin graphics and gameplay, the cast of bizzare characters make up for it, alongside the strange story. The PC port is unfortunately terrible, providing no graphics options, locked 720p resolution, locked 30fps, (According to Framerate Police) potential degrade in performance over time, failing to start on Windows 8, and frequent crashing. A mod called dpfix by the same dude that made the beautiful dsfix for Dark Souls' infamous PC port fixes issues and gives graphics options to the player. Now play this and make a Sinners' Sandwich.

1676	0	a	It runs like complete garbage for how it looks, and like most poorly optimized games, lowering the graphics settings doesn't do much at all. My PC exceeds the recommended specs, yet at absolute minimunm settings I can barely pull a stuttery 40fps. FoV is capped at 65 vertical for no good reason, â¥â¥â¥â¥ filters all over the place that can't be disabled, janky controls obviously designed for a console, and mediocre gunplay set to an incredibly idiodic story make this a disappointingly bad game. It might have been worth it for five bucks on sale just to play TimeSplitters 2's campaign on PC, but unfortunately this game is crippled by a disgustingly bad business practice:  Denuvo, and all that brings. No doubt one of the bigger reasons for my â¥â¥â¥â¥ performance, and a draconian DRM that requires constant online validation via their servers. The game cannot be played offline, and any hardware/software changes require you to revalidate as if you just bought the game. When Deep Silver stops caring about this game, it stops being playable. That is completely unacceptable. Stop treating your paying customers like thieves.

652	1	a	I TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME BEST GAME VEVER 10/10
2116	0	a	I bought it, played it to completion and I would say that it was mediocre in most every aspect.  The modular weapon system is annoying more than anything and baffling in some of the constraints (I can't have a grenade launcher and a marksmans' rifle at the same time what?)  Enemies randomly and infinitely respawning is really annoying - especially when they respawn right next to you or in a place they couldn't have gotten to (because you were in the way of the only entrance, for example)  While it might in theory be possible to evade line of sight of enemies and play cleverly, the placement of enemies on maps makes this improbable as there are groups of 2-4 enemies placed every 30-40 feet in some areas which means that any direction the player moves will result in detection by a new enemy.  Vehicles feel clumsy (with mouse and keyboard, anyhow).  One of the biggest annoyances in the game was that later on, my cooperative teammates were usless - they couldn't keep up with me and the lethal situations I had to bypass they would just run into and immediately die.  One or two of the missions are poorly done and extremely frustrating. In one mission you have to stay close to a vehicle that drives out of the area while being quickly destroyed by rockets. There are absurd numbers of other enemies around and if you happen to become their target you will quickly die.   The story is baffling, too. In the end you're left with no real feeling of victory and no reasonable expectation that the limited success you've attained you could hold.   The story is less open world than semilinear narrative, and in some places very narrative.  I can't recommend it for the price that it is listed at. This is a 30 dollar game, in all fairness.  MULTIPLAYER   I have not been able to join a multiplayer game. I don't know if they are working, or how they work but I've never been able to join one and never had anyone join mine when I waited.

1183	1	a	Apart from some glitch encountered with the notebook and chores missions, it's one of the funniest game I've played. Awsome achievements!
2595	1	a	In Deadly premonition you play the role of FBI Special Agent Francis York Morgan, but you can call him York, everybody calls him that, sent to a town to investigate the murder of a young girl. While the premise sounds generic and cliche, Deadly Premonition is anything but that and is by far one of the most unique games I've ever played. Deadly Premonition features dated visuals, mediocre gameplay and more bugs than in your backyard yet it's still an extremely memorable and unique experience that shines most brightly on it's plot and narrative.   While I'm first and for most gameplay over everything when it comes to gaming, Deadly Premonition is one of the only, if not the only game I'd recommend based on it's setting, plot and characters. The game is a mixture of Thriller, Horror and Dark Comedy blended together in a extremely unique manner.  While you may be put off by the dated, crude presentation and bugs this game possesses, it's still an experience that I couldn't recommend enough if you can overlook it's faults. It's so bad that it's a masterpiece, think of the film Troll 2 which is widely regarded as the 'best worst film' of all time and is an absolutely hilarious masterpiece for all the wrong reasons. The gameplay itself is somewhat reminiscent of Resident Evil 4 but has some awkward controls, thankfully this does little to affect the game as the focus is on it's incredibly strong writing.  The story is absolutely brilliant thanks to the writers eccentric and quirky style, there really is nothing out there like this. Again I do recommend caution when buying this game, you'll need to tweak a few things in order to even get the game to run and there are a few mods which enhance the visuals and allow the game to be played 1080p but that aside this is an experience that should not be overlooked if you're a fan of crime stories and unique writing.

817	1	a	This game is a great small sandbox game, it is not open world, but more of a sandbox. You are in a mansion, and can freely move anywhere, but limited to some places based upon progression; the more you progress, the more areas you can enter. If you are in it for the story, get it. I got this for 1 dollar, and was worth it, as it only took me 4 hours to complete, the levels in between are very short and small, and I would not consider this a puzzle, since it is way too easy. This game is rated A for adults only cause well...kids shouldn't play this =P 8/10 for very short chapters.

1819	0	a	Totally unrealistic.  First lets start off with the fact that everybody in the world loves North Korea. So, if we liberated the Americans from their capitalist opressors they would be jublient about the fact that they now live under me, Kim Jong Un. Second, because most Americans live in tents, eat birds and snow, and buy guns to kill each other, they would have no effecive logistical means to supply a effective resistance. Third, its a well known fact that everyone who lives in North Korea is very happy all the time. Those who are not happy are sent to 'Happiness Camps' where they re-learn how glorious the DPRK is compared to the rest of the world. In fact they love me so much in North Kore I always get 100% of the vote because they all love me so much. Anyway, this propaganda piece is nothing more then just lies being pushed by Obama, George W bush, the South Korean government, the Japanese government, and the American CIA.

1587	1	a	  Its like Farcry and Division had a baby with a slight birth defect.  Its actually not that bad of a game, I managed to power through the entire single player campaign during the free weekend. The biggest complaint I have about it is the weapons...the ONLY silent weapon you get other than your knife is the pistol / SMG / air pistol which REALLY sucked especially since towards the end one of the guys is toting the AR with a suppressor.  You really end up only needing 2-3 weapons out of all of them and by the end of it if you liberate everything you end up owning every piece of gear, attachment, and all skills leveled up. Some of the weapons just seemed pointless. I didnt even use the cross bow with its 3 variations. Bravo by the way with the weapon variations.  You pick one weapon like the AR and you get 2 additional with a slight purchase. It was certainly different but also kind of annoying as not all weapons could use the same attachements. Literally the only weapon that the suppressor went on is the pistol... Sorry to keep bringing that part up, it really annoyed me.  All in all though the game was pretty good, graphics were beautiful. AI was a little lacking, but it was not too bad.

2482	1	a	This game was 10 years in development for translation into English so it could be released in North America. It reminds me of the old school RPG gaming and I miss that in today's games.  There is no voice acting in Inquisitor so I hope you like lots of reading because there is allot of it to do.  I didn't play it for a lengthy time as I was getting board reading and reading and reading. However its a very in depth story and they gave every NPC in the game there own personality.  Your character creation screen is limited as to your portrait and you select one of the five or six pre-remade pictures, not that it matters really.  Graphically the game is very pretty and the story is very good but I had a hard time wanting to continue to play as there was to much reading and I tend to drift off when there is that much to do.  Picking up the game for $4.99 or less is a good deal, if your really into this type of gaming and can spend the hours and hours of reading then for $9.99 its worth the price.

Scroll all the way down until you find 'PhysX_SystemSoftware' right click it -&gt; Repair wait a few second and *BOOM* the game should lunch! ______  Putting that a side, I'm more than 9 hours into the game and had 0 crashes. The only crash that I ever got was when I installed the game and tried to lunch it. Read a guide that told me to do what I wrote above and.. that's it.  Now, I got this when it was on sale and my gosh the game is a mess! But not that bad kind of a mess! It's amazing! It's impossible to explain, but I'll try my best... Take a bowl, put open world into it, then a bloody and a very horrible crime, elements of some comedy, a mix of good/bad controls, a mix of good/bad graphics, a mix of good/bad soundtrack, a mix of good/bad voice acting, cars that slide on turns, the best coffee with milk. Take all that, mix it up really good. Cook it for at least 20 hours and serve it to an FBI agent!!  Everything I wrote above made little to no sense? Well that just what it is! If you can handle a literally bloody story, then you should try it. Otherwise.. I don't think you'll like it. You have to risk it to get the biscuit. At least that's what I saw in my coffee..

2915	1	a	You won't find a game quite like this anywhere else. I trudged through glitches, crashes, slow gameplay, more crashes, and more crashes, I came against many game-breaking issues that I barely scraped by, and one game-stopping conundrum at the very end. It was absolutely miserable...and I feel it was totally worth it.  Watch out if you don't have patience, spare time, or sense of humor or open-mindedness, The gameplay is slow, clunky, and often boring, but I was never bored. I was always excitedly wondering when the next part of the story was going to unfold. I'd perhaps groan when I knew a long filler part was starting, but going through it all I'd be thinking was 'I can't wait to see what happens in the next cutscene.' The characters and story are a grand slam, though it gets quite weird.  The soundtrack is stilted but majestically strange, and a perfect fit for the game.  Now, this game is often a rollercoaster ride between genius and complete cheeseball, but both ends of the spectrum are equally enjoyable. I love cheese, but I also felt legitimately touched during parts of this game. This is the type of game I never want to forget about, and probably won't.  Read non-spoiler reviews such as this one, and go with your gut. You'll probably know by then if this game is for you or not.
2158	0	a	It runs very bad even on medium settings and the gameplay isnt that great. so as of right now dont buy it
2857	1	a	This game is amazing. One of the funniest games I've ever played, and one of the only few games to capture that B-grade movie feeling of low budget, roughness and unnintentional humour. If you can overlook bugs and technical flaws you are out for quite an experience.  Can't recommend it highly enough!
139	1	a	I think this is a great take on the MOBA style of gameplay. Albeit that there are quite a small number of heroes to pick from, it is a well made game that I have been playing since it was released on Impulse. If you are a fan of LoL, Dota, or HoN, I highly recommend getting this game.

1909	0	a	I played this on the free weekend. Thought it was boring, I cannot recommend this to anyone at any price.  All the systems are in place for a FarCry-esque game but they just don't seeem to come together enough to make a compelling experience.
2386	0	a	  --- TL;DR SUMMARY--- PROS: - Nice open world design - Good graphics - Variety of guns - Good ideas for a game...  CONS: - ...Good ideas that go poorly executed. - Mute player character - Flat characters and near meaningless interaction - Story that doesn't deliver. - 4 hours in, and i'm too bored to continue.  ---Prerequisite system info--- I'm playing on a 980ti at 2560x1440 with everything (including temporal AA) maxed and I'm averaging 85fps with adaptive gsync. It's steady and I have no real issues with the performance. Great job devs.  ----DAY 01--- I like the graphics and sound. The game has a good atmosphere, especially at night time. The guns are servicable. As others have commented, they do lack punch. Gameplay is a little repetitive, but the action is solid so its not that bad. Overall, for my first two hours I would say that the game is stable, fast and enjoyable. I just hope the gameplay opens up a little bit and expands on what you do as the player, because after taking over all the areas of the starting zone, you realize how large the map is and wonder if the gameplay will be repetitive throughout that whole experience. We'll see! Recommended.  ---DAY 02--- I've returned to the game and it's obvious there are some possible issues. First, the game is constantly streaming data. This makes sense given the open world nature, however I would go so far as to say this is borderline trashing the hard drive. The data streaming never really interferes with the gameplay, but it does result in some texture and geometry popin. Given that I'm on a fairly powerful rig and using a 6TB WD Black, the amount of IO needed to sustain the world is somewhat surprising. Suggest that you run this one from SSD or NVME if you can spare the 40 (!) TB.  As far as the game itself, I have to admit the world is starting to feel kind of flat after only 3-4 hours in. There is an abundance of good (mostly) VO work to help things along, but the mute player protagonist just seens to have nothing to say in a world so full of things to comment on. The missions and orders you receive all start to sound the same. After capturing the entirety of the first section of the map, I felt that there just wouldn't be much else to do. Its like Farcry, only less open and more modern. Maybe the most damning part of it all is that after roughly 4 hours, i'm just too bored to continue playing. There are not enough mechanics or story hooks to keep me going. It's just one mission after the next. Shame, this game has good ideas for what it wants to be, it just fails to execute them into something that is compelling to play.
2747	1	a	I dunno what to say about this game ecxept... Stiff controls, stiff yesteryears animations and stiff voice acting. But it the atmosphere really reeks of an old classic serie called 'Twin Peaks.' I f*cken' it more than putting my d*ck in a cardboard box full of jelly with strawberry taste.  So if you can put your d*ck in it, 'survive' the controls and all the other crap but really love 'old' thriller games with Twin Peaks homage, then you f*ckin' do it.
1140	1	a	As you can see I haven't played this game so much yet, but I've already found a couple of issues with the game, that's quite off putting for me.  First of all, the 3rd person view they've decided on using for the game, is incredibly annoying. Lucious's head is in the way a lot of the time if you need to have a closer look at things (which you often do), and at too far a distance, it gets hard to see what's hidden inside all the drawers and cupboards.  Secondly, I have to admit I was a tiny bit disappointed at the lack of a 'sandbox' mode, when this game is being described by the developers as 'Open World'. I can accept the premise that the house and the surroundings is the only area you can be in, but the fact that it isn't sandboxed, and it feels like you're being forced to do things in a certain way (where's the fun in that?) is definitely a bit off putting.   However, when all that's said and done, I haven't played that game that much yet (mainly because of the 3rd person issue), so as such, this review can mostly comment on the mechanics of the game.   The actual game itself, and the premise for it, seems amazing (which is why I bought it in the first place), so hopefully these things will manage to negate the drawbacks of the game.  I'm still having trouble getting into the game because of the way they made 3rd person viewing, and the lack fo any 1st person viewing, but I'd still reccommend this game try, if you happen to find it on offer.

2862	1	a	What a port. Theres a german saying 'Verschlimmbessert' which unfortunately cant be translated. Disimprove?  Gave this another try since i finally got me an xbox controller for my pc (keyboard+mouse controls like â¥â¥â¥) and they switched the controls around and actually made em worse. Great.  Then the 'HD' treatment. Some assets (mainly UI) got retouched (looking worse but thats a matter of personal taste i guess) and slapped together with old stuff making for nice eye biting contrast. Some of the 3D Models for the inventory items got a shiny slime filter or something tossed onto them. The resolution is higher but the textures are the same resulting in highres blurryness. Amazing. The original wasnt a graphical marvel but at least consistent.   Additionally the game seems a litte too fast which actually managed to make me a little nauseous. Last game that did that was Starfox on SNES. Audio is still messed up. Nice shot.  The Thumbs up is for Deadly Premonition and that people who never ever plan on buying a Xbox360 ever ever (its cheap now and theres alot of other pretty good games...) have a chance of experiencing it - even in the warped form of this suboptimal port.

608	0	a	It has a nice concept, but ultimately the game is just very poorly executed. On the technical side I've experienced numerous glitches and a few crashes. In-game the inventory and 'mission log' are very awkward to use, and the map is broken. The game offers little support for your objectives. As it has some puzzle elements this isn't necessarily a bad thing, but the game has such tight grip on how a specific objective or 'kill' has to be executed that some kind of support would be nice. The fact that the game's kills are largely scripted doesn't even bother me that much. The main frustration lies in the fact that you have to carry it out exactly as the game wants you to. For instance, halfway through the game you are tasked with carrying water outside without gaining any suspicion. As all but one character are in the same room this could have been as easy as taking a bucket from the laundry room, filling it with water and carrying it outside without bumping into any NPC. Instead, the game wants you to go to a very specific room and take a very specific object to carry the water around. Unfortunately it doesn't end there. Some of the more interesting sections have you sneaking through the mansion at night. As some of the NPCs are still awake you have to take care not to bump into them. However, as the game is rather unforgiving in this, such sequences quickly turn into trial and error. In the game, you use specific powers such as telekinesis and mind control to achieve objectives. A downside is that simple things like picking up stuff or opening doors are treated in the same manner, meaning that this form of interaction also has to be selected from a hotkey. This became frustrating when I spent five minutes trying to open a door but wasn't able to do so as I still had telekinesis selected as active ability. When using a power such as telekinesis or mind control you have to aim extremely careful for it to take effect. Towards the end, this became so tricky that I had to go to the options menu to considerably lower my mouse sensitivity. The game has some annoying invisible walls (or rather 'fences') placed around some objects which obscure your ability to toss fireballs past them. A plus side is that this is one of the very few games where you play a true villain (not just an antihero) and that the atmosphere is very nice. It is just pitiful that the game is so poorly executed.  Tl;dr: nice concept; bad execution.

1033	1	a	This game is intensely fun, allowing you to play as the unrepentant villain in a Hitman-style game that never feels to big or too small. As you learn the mansion, you zip around looking for targets, because this game doesn't believe in giving you everything on a silver platter, and I like that. It looks great, and after five hours I only experienced one glitch. My only real complaint is the initial unforgiving nature of the stealh bits, but it's later rectified by a skill you get. This game is worth every penny you spend on it, and I'd reccommend this to anyone who likes stealth-action-puzzle games.
2658	1	a	This game is quirky, unpolished and unfortunately very crash prone - but nonetheless a hidden gem in my opinion. Story, characters and atmosphere are simply great. It is an open world mystery thriller with a strong resemblance to the TV series Twin Peaks by David Lynch, which is quite unique as far as I know. Apart from the main storyline there are numerous side missions. Most of them are somewhat hidden, but they provide additional understanding of the world (a North-American small town) and the people within it. After many entertaining hours it was hard for me to say goodbye to Greenvale in the end.

1017	1	a	 Lucius... aka Antichrist Simulator from Damien Thorn, in The Omen (1976) movie.   The game itself plays a lot like the Hitman series, minus the shooting aspect. Like the game name says, you play as Lucius, a 6 years old (midway in the game, you get 7!) who was fortunate enough to had been born in a satanic invocation. It doesn't take long to go around, learn the basics and then, get on with it on your murder list!  There isn't much to be said about this game, concerning the story and gameplay. It gets the job done and honestly, I can't understand the gaming industry bashing this game. I liked it mostly for all its numerous faults and cons and it was satisfying enough to keep me interested and playing till the end (game is about 6 hours long).  PROS: +Antichrist antihero (feels weird and cool at the same time! Be THE creepy kid with powers!). +Creepy, tensed and gory atmosphere during the murder scenes. +Game is challenging enough to keep you guess the next step although, you can always get a walkthrough guide to speed things up! +Lots of exploring to do in this huge mansion.  CONS: -Some gameplay mechanics weren't responsive fast enough, especially during that Chapter 10 stealth mission. Patrolling grownups could see me even well hidden through walls and doors. -Straightforward linear killing list. -At some chapters startup, the game lacks direction as to where to go, what to do as you roam around the big mansion aimlessly. Quite irritating! Better read a walkthrough as I sure did around Chapter 5. Also, the map could use refinement! -The chores side quests are really worthless and only time sink. I suggest you simply ignore them... well the ones that you can as some could be mandatory, like that tape cassette for Micheal. -Save-game mechanic is atrocious. No quick-save, no auto save midway in a mission. You are forced to start a chapter and finish it so you can be sure the game saves your progress there.   OVERALL: Faulty game but entertaining enough (to me though) to keep you playing until the showdown. Lucius felt exactly like 'The Omen' simulator and it was a decent entry for this franchise. I do expect the sequel to surpass this game especially on the visual aspect as it is very lackluster (yes, game looks quite ugly), the gameplay mechanics and game direction with a better pathing on a reliable map.  RECOMMENDATION: Loved The Omen movie and loves creepy adventure styles game? This game is for you! Just, wait for a decent deal before forking you dough in this game.  RATING: 666 / 666 ... 6.66 / 10

2875	1	a	Let's get the biggest negatives out of the way. Buggy. Gameplay reminiscent of old resident evil games - may be good or bad depending on your perspective. Locked resolution (there's a mod), dated graphics (dem textures). If you don't enjoy hours of exploration, you will essentially need a guide to help you locate sidequests. Sidequests are repetitive.  The story is great and I personally think the main character in particular is excellent. There are a handful of sidequests that provide genuinely useful items for the effort you put in (wrench, radio, weather doll) and the rest are forgettable. Combat is decent. Aiming with the mouse is stiff, but aiming compensation makes it very easy to achieve headshots.  Over all, for the price I bought it at ($10 I think) I would recommend it, provided quite an entertaining experience. For $25, there are better things to spend money on.  
696	0	a	So this is what it's like to control a whale.  It's creative, but what it really boils down to is a 'Use the hints to press E on something' simulator.

1176	0	a	I really want to like this game. I want to like it so much that I played through the whole thing, despite realizing how bad it was going to be 20 minutes in. It's right up my alley with its grizley subject matter and over-the top style. Everything is lovably purple, with the number 666 showing up pretty much anywhere any kind of number is called for. On that level the game is brilliant.   But aside from a lovable style, there's not actually much of a game here. There's no freedom, no challenge. Each level drops you into the house, where you follow a line on a map until you run into a certain NPC. The game shouts 'There! That's the person you're trying to kill on this level!' Then you check your notebook for some hint at how the game wants you to get that job done. You follow that hint until you reach another hint, then follow that hint, and so on, until someone dies. There's never more than a single path towards killing any given target, so there's no decisions to be made. The only thing that might actually be considered a challenge is figuring out what the hints mean. The hints oscilate between so obvious as to be trivial, and so obtuse as to be useless. There's no happy middle between the two. No sense of satisfaction in figuring stuff out.   Then there are the times when you need a tool that isn't already in your inventory. Some specific item, like a screwdriver. Your first instinct is to go look for where you'd keep a screwdriver in your own home. Is it in the garage? The tool shed? Nope. It's on a table in the sitting room. You just have to wander around aimlessly, scanning every drawer and surface while you wonder if you're missing something that would make this fun.   The demonic powers are also a little annoying. I could ignore the fact that the telekenisis never feels right, or that the fireballs are basically only available in pre-scripted sections of the game. That stuff, to a degree, makes sense. But the ability to make people forget seeing you doesn't even work! The moment your seen, all of the controls go completely dead, so there's no opportunity to use it. I went so far as intentionally getting caught multiple times in a row just to try and figure out what I was doing wrong, but it's no use.   The game's cutscenes are too numerous and too boring. And even as numerous as they are, they often fail to explain things. Without spoiling anything, the game's story makes a few strange leaps forward that I still don't really understand. Several characters apparently come out of nowhere. Halfway through the game everyone starts talking about my uncle. Your mom even tells you to stop bothering your uncle, because he's been complaining about you lately. Meanwhile I'm left to wonder who or where my uncle is, because it's the first time I'm hearing about him.   I'm disappointed that the game wound up being as bland and boring as it is. The graphics are nice and clear, the controls are mostly pretty solid, the deaths are reasonably creative. In most respects the game is a competently assembled thing. But there are just too many problems for me to give it a blanket recommendation.   I'd say you should buy it only if you meet two criteria: 1. You, like me, think the premise is AWESOME.  2. It's on sale for less than $3.   Otherwise, give this a pass.

Walk around, shoot KPA, blow up and sabatoge stuff. Fun and all but could have had more. Note, i have not played the addon mission which I have installed but im assuming more of the same gameplay. Overall, really different kind of first person shooter with the whole open world style map.

892	1	a	Hi guys, may the satanism and blasphemy be with you!  While my introduction rises the best welcomes of the year, I've played and finished this game and this is my opinion. Step 1 - if you don't like puzzle game with classic satan cliche' it's better if you look elsewhere, but if you get this game under the helloween moon, a bit for fun, and a bit for curiosity, you will not regret.  The game focus on how to kill people of a house without be directly involved. This means no shotguns, no direct approach, no fireballs... (maybe). Anyway you have to inspect the house, find elements and merge them with the environment to produce consequences... people react to consequences and in that fault you may arise into the lucifer domain, killing without a trace.  A part the story that is enough funny and ironic, the game is serius and grab from pagan legend the history of possessed people. In any case you are the Evil there, so you don't have nothing to fear about. This make the story a horror story.. fo the others!  Well it's all funny? Yes... someway. I've noticed a couple of bugs (the most bad was at the last scene, so I had to reload the game to have the game complete... and this was disappointing) but in general the quest are interesting. You will have to use also superpowers during the game progression, with an insert of new mechanics to complete the job.   Boring is also the saving system. If you quit, some object and actions you have done will be erased. The checkpoint are of course the kills. Graphics is detailed but a bit plastic. Your character move and play without saying any word, while the people of the house always repeat the same things.  Well, if you are going to get a smooth and interesting halloween this is the game for you. Do not expect it will last a life.. just a couple of days to be finished.  Lord Hol Napult's experience: 7/10

2769	1	a	Probably one the most abysmal PC ports ever made (even worse than the Dark Souls port), although it varies between PC's in how it performs. First half of the game gave me random crashes, second half would slow down gradually the more new areas I loaded into.  But this game is amazing. It's amazing amazing. You must remember or heard of Destructoid's Jim Sterling giving it a perfect 10/10? Yeah, I don't like him either, but now that I have gone back and read his review, it makes perfect sense. Also, if you love Twin Peaks, you can't help but fall in love with this game either. Not only does Deadly Premonition have an excellent soundtrack, story, and characters that just feel so real, natural and quirky, but it doesn't forget itself as being extremely videogamey in every sense of the word or feeling, however you want to interpret that. The only cons I can think of would be the possible issues (or no issues) you might have with the port, the game looking like it released late Xbox generation, and mediocre filler shooting sections.

The creativity going into this game is amazing but it feels like they poured all of their attention into the concepts and then gave up half-way trying to put them into a game whole-heartedly.  It's still a good game, it can get so boring wandering around a mansion, which is easy to get lost in. (And pick up literally everything that you find, it'll come in useful later and saves running around looking for it.) Perfect for people who like to think outside the box, or people who just enjoy murder. 6/10 would devil again

2399	1	a	This game has it, but definitely needs optimization. From what i saw in previous posts, I dont think it matters what badass setup your running and SLI is compatible at this time. If you think it is, take a look at your data analysis, should show you your primary card is the only one getting abused at 99%. there is no way your going to get good or even smooth play frame rates. expecially in city . your looking at 15-25 maybe......hide in a dumpster your golden right back at 60 -140. you cant stay in there all day and win your revolution.  for me its 60/40 % 60 smooth play game looks great gets repetative but coop is more fun......40 it lags to the point i just rage and jump to another game. to me at this point till an update to address this i cant recommend anyone to get this not until you see comments that its just repetative NOT that it LAGS like the release of STAR CITIZEN  Well I Now stand to correct my review. I should have done this a little sooner. The game has been optimized a lot better since my review. I am able to max everything out in 4k BUT LEAVING ANTI ALIAZING OFF. Its really just overkill at that resolution. So I'm now at a very playable stable 50fps avg with Vsync on. I use an OLED TV. My setup is more akin to console style being an early pioneer of HTPC. I game on my pc in comfort from a movie theatre style recliner with heated and chilled drink holders and customized pull out keyboard or food tray tables. I would not dare game from a desk. Now that Homefront is playable I can say its not too bad. Its not that good either. The play through of the story is somewhat decent and the graphics are quite enjoyable to watch. What brings it down for me is it feels after about 2hrs of straight playthrough it just get stale. The bases and objectives you have conquer in between major story plots gets repetitive. There just should be more to taking over a controlled base then running in and syncing a laptop or blowing up fuel containers. As good as the detailed graphics are, it just doesn't feel rewarding to gun through slopes you have to go through. Except close combat now thats not bad, when you get to watch the eyes of your victim role up in the back of their heads when you jam your blade up though their jaw(cool). I haven't tried the co-op part yet which I want to do. So as of now I can recommend the game in its fixxed state i'm giving it a 7 of 10. just cause thae graphics are great and if you play through quick the major story plot are very good keeping you engaged. Future story additions will be very welcome and if the co-op adds more life to Homefront i could give it an 8.  There is something I'm noticing while playing through and thats a real bad flaring effect. Its like having the sun right in your eyes. I though it was bad coding from having bloom on but its not that, for it still happens when I have it off. Its from time to time going in and out of buildings. Something I'm hoping for is more weapons and devices to be more sinister on killing these Koreans, being able to to hijack tanks and trucks and mowing down the enemy would be a welcome addition.
1209	1	a	This is a strange little game really - it's kind of like super sprint and micro machines but in a sort of open world setting where you do missions which involve driving from A to B and you have to kill as many zombies as possible. Its a great little mish mash of genres to create something a little bit different and it works. It even has boss fights too.   It also has a racing career mode too and the races are kinda nuts really as you try stay in front, kill zombies and win to earn more money to buy better cars, upgrades and weapons.   The only real con to the game so far is the poor voice acting but then I didnt buy this for the voice acting or immersion really. I just wanted a fun little game to go between other games that didnt require me to amass an encyclopedias worth of knowledge about builds, techniques startegies etc but would let me rip loose and feel like a boss. This game does that.  It aint no FORZA but then you don't get to kill zombies in FORZA. brought it on sale - totally worth the money.  ---- edit --- and still loving it a few weeks later. Ace game to go to everynow and again for thoughless violence

This game has a bad case of Duke Nukem Forever, it is obvious that this was not a completed product but since it was move from one developer to another they felt the pressure to just get the game out on market.   I was looking forward to this game quite a bit, and it did not fail completely out of my personal return policy requirements, but I can not recommend it to other people in all fairness. If they can fix their broken crap I would happily change this review into a positive.   Right now though wait to buy this game.

1234	1	a	For the cheap price of this game and the level of fun you'll have, you might be quite surprised when you play Zombie Driver. Its basically what you might expect in terms of its name but just the realism and fun you can have with the vehicles alone is great mix. Along with a few interesting extra mini-games to keep you going. The game has alot of heart to it and the overall control of the vehicles is based upon the vehicle itself or how you read the city and not from bad game mechanics. You might lose a few times in some levels, but the overall result of this game definitely made you feel like a total badass zombie killer. And isn't that what we all want? ^O^
1241	1	a	Very entertaining game. Has 3 game modes and multiple vehicles. Story mode has 31 missions and they are kinda short. Race mode is a little difficult on my opinion, but fun as well. Slaughter mode is great but a little exhausting. The gold score is high and you get points very slowly. But you get used to it and actually don't even pay attention to the score while playing. Really enjoyable. Better than I expected. Great addition to my library.

838	1	a	It's better conceptually than it is in execution. The house is in essentially the same state for a majority of the game, and even though months have passed by in game, some characters stay in the exact same spot saying the exact same things until you end up killing them. It's a good thing that figuring out the murder puzzles and be quite fun and challenging at times.  Lucius reminds of the old flash games I'd play, but the graphics and mechanics are obviously way better. Much like those games, though, I wouldn't expect to get more than a day's worth of fun out of it.  Try it out. Kill some people. Witness the storyline. Expect to uninstall it because there's not that much replay value. It's worth it for a run through, though.
1688	1	a	I was kinda homing they would continue with the original homefront, but this is more enough enjoyable enough in its sense, has a far cry ish feel, but its enjoyable to me.

108	0	a	In desperate need of a single player campain. Sad, this game could have been pretty good. The lack of a campain left me wondering what to do, and quickly wondering why I was playing. A small gripe would be that the fluff desciption of the all father disapearing is wrong, the game into says he was killed. This proto-moba could have had a lot going for it, and I would be thrilled to see some of the demi-gods show up in Smite, as at least 2 (Sedna and Queen of thorns, aka The Obsidion Butterfly) are real historical dieites. The Queen may show up, shes Aztac/Mayan, but i doubt they will fit in a lone Inuit diety in the mix. Still between the two Sedna is the one with a dwarf planet named after her.
2291	0	a	I dont do alot of reviews but this game seems broken, online is only as good as the host and people skip all over, the visuals remind me of a bad B movie were they try to save money by making everything dark so you are focused on the action so you dont look at how poor everthing looks, 1080i looks like 640/480(grainey) and its not smooth at all, its very jerky you lag in and out of scope. The origional Homefront I think actually looked better. That being said I do believe its poorly optimized and can be fixed, it is playable but at this time a thumbs down, they should of had all this and multiplayer servers.  Update: I really tried to like this game, I really did but its the first and only steam game of 100's that i requested a refund.

All those bugs people were talking about were not in this latest release, so yeah, they fixed it. The major problem is the AI of the game, and that's because there is no AI. The enemies are dumb, its easy to past them without beeing noticed, and if you do, it's easy to escape. Combat is very good, thou. Weapons costumization is also great and it's a good story. It's a 16 hours or less game.

2526	0	a	Beautifull artwork, enjoyable storyline, poorly thought-out combat design. Particularly irritating side-quest design. Example: You've talked to every named NPC in town except one. That last NPC offers a side-quest. Now you have to talk to all of the named NPC's once again to glean information about the quest. Imagine having to do this for every single quest; Compounding irritation as you walk across town over and over and over again. This is required for every side-quest I had encountered in the first town.   Combat mechanics are just as irritating. The stamina stat exists solely to enforce spamming of both stamina and mana potions. Spell casting requires stamina and mana. Being struck by enemies consumes stamina. Attacking enemies consumes stamina. Stamina only regenerates out of combat, if you are not moving. You need to stand still and essentially not play the game for several minutes after each combat if you wish to regenerate stamina without potions. You can't walk back to town, or pick up loot, you can only do nothing.   Potions are relatively cheap, which is good. However, you can not bulk puchase potions. Each sizeable combat scenario, or dungeon, will have you consuming tens of potions. These are purchased from the abundant vendors by dragging and dropping items across inventory screens one item at a time. Enjoyable gameplay mechanic, right? BTW, your companions will need a plethora of health potions too. Fun!   TL:DR. I like the idea of this game, the art is pretty, but the core mechanics are far too irritating for me to recommend it.

616	1	a	A really cool game that I believe was inspired from The Omen movie. You play as Lucius, the son of Lucifer. Lucius was born June 6th, 1966 (666 incase you haven't figured it out lol) into a family where his grandfather was worshiping and offering sacrifices in a hidden chamber all the way since his kids were young (Lucius bio father and his brother), which is the reason the family is so rich.  The game starts when Lucius and his family are celebrating his 6th birthday when Lucifer visits him in a vision and points him to kill the maid. After he's done it, while Lucius is sleeping Lucifer visits him in his dream and teaches him a new skill. And that's basically what the game's all about, killing people and learning new abilities to use to kill people marked by Lucifer, until the end where you all the choas happens (won't spoil it) and you leave the manor as an innocent young kid and taken away by the detective after the fire that was burning down the manor.   You can do many things other than solving puzzles and killing people around the house like tricycling around the manor, annoying people, messing around with your abilities, getting detected and then erasing the memory from those who saw you use it, doing chores for your parents and people who work at the manor which gets you some gifts like the tricycle, music box and a boad game.  - Graphics: 6.5/10 but it really isn't that important to me. - Story: 8/10 It was entertaining and fun. - Gameplay: 7.5/10 Could've been better. - Price: I got it off BundleStars along with a few games in a bundle for $2.49 and it was totally worth it. If you don't like the full price, just wait for it to go on sale and get it along with Lucius II.   Final score: 7/10. Good and fun game.

2452	0	a	The lore of this game is immense. I wish I could brag about being a big, bad hardcore RPG'er who savored every bit of it, but it overwhelmed me and I wound up zooming through it, hoping that it contained no vital information. Every inhabitant of the doomed little village you start out in has loads to tell you. Loads! If you try the game, please do the developer justice and listen to it, so that I can rest my guilt over this. I'm an ungrateful â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, because the creators of this game have really put in an effort here.  The graphics have a dated feel and I could live with that. My biggest gripe is that the character moves very slowly across the screen. He's a snail. And the battles are way too hard in the beginning, which makes it frustrating to get to know the game. It should not affect how I judge this game, but I'm a pitiful gamer who prefers having an illusion of challenge and feel good about myself when I steamroll over it. Please shoot me.

It will get tedious over time so I ended up playing a few missions and then coming back to it months later.

Now many years later, North Korea enforces occupation with the KPA, who police all citizens with an iron fist. You have joined the resistance and fight to give freedom back to the USA and end North Korea's occupation.  Story line is really good, with great graphics, but fights are a little repetitious (i.e. hard, given the KPA's superior numbers and guns). Money can be really hard to obtain without searching through every trash pile you come across, so upgrades are far and few between. Very interesting and entertaining, but I'd be willing to wait for it to go on a big sale ('75% off, with all DLC') before paying full price.

Pros:  -Very dificult at times but not so dificult that it isn't fun -Amazing soundtrack -Clearly the developer put their heart into this game -a massive map to explore -the game lets you complete the story at your own pace and with items in different orders so it has replay value  Cons:  -Honestly none, this game is so much fun I cannot do it justice    
988	1	a	Lucius was a pretty interesting game. The concept was pretty unique, although it would have been nice to be more creative with each kill. Replay is kind of dead since once you've played through it once, that's pretty much it. Nothing really is added for replay value.
1702	1	a	The Homefront series evolved from linear Call-of-Duty-like single player game to Far-Cry-like game.The first Homefront was an average title with a story,which potential's been wasted.There was nothing innovative about that title and the same happened to its sequel.The game has a repetitive gameplay,is poorly optimised and has dull characters(especially the crazy girl...totally horrible).I have never cared less when the main characters died, in their last act of heroism, than in this game. Additionally the activation method of the box version is needlessly complicated. Stirring up the revolution may be enjoyable,but only for a few hours - the rest becomes a struggle to survive to the end.  +Good graphics in some places +Heavy atmosphere +Weapon modifications +Character movement is slick  -Dull characters -Poor optimisation -Graphics could have been better,taking in account it's a Cry Engine -Boring storyline -Repetitive gameplay -Stupid AI -Many exploits,making the game easier  I can recommend this game,but only if you can get it on some sale.

885	0	a	I maybe should blame myself for how much of a let down this game was. I purchased it under the assumption that it would be a haunt and kill reminiscent of Sega genesis game that I played as a youth (The name escapes me as I write this review). Lucius is not this type of game. Lucius functions like an old style adventure game, where when the specific criteria is met, the story can move forward. I feel bad because this game could have been a gem, it has about seventy percent of what it needs to be a good game, but thirty percent off is enough to make all the difference. Do not purchase this game under any assumptions of what it is, i'll explain it quickly, Someone visits the home, do exactly the right thing with the required items and that is all.   Simply put, rating 4/10

I was rly hoping to see more building customization options in this game cos lets face it, you cannot beat LoL or Dota 2 on same rules , im playing Demigod not cos im bored of LoL or D2 but cos i was hoping to see something more , like moba + tower defence mix. Im voting Yes only cos i think this game have huge potential but right now it's not realized yet  And champions need faster moving speed, its rly annoying to move so slow lol
1512	1	a	This game wasn't nearly as bad as people said it was. The game isn't as optimized as it could be, but it is fun eventhough its formula is not original by any means. Gun play is solid enough with mouse and keyboard but steer clear of using a controller as this is where it gets clunky. Overall I enjoyed the experience. By no means is it the best game in the world but given its rough development, I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was as good as it was. I would only recommend buying this on sale.

1603	1	a	i have played the original and this one was far better. honestly i love playing FPS games that have great storylines. this game is gritty, pretty brutal and all around fun to play. with how player driven the storyline gets, it has some replay ability value in it for future playthroughs.
2230	1	a	Looking at other peoples reviews, im starting to think that most people just like to â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ about anything they can find,, i dont know any of that bull crap geek talk or what half that sh!!t means,, the game runs good on my old as Sh!t comp, the online coop is amazing and lets you go about it how ever you want, and the single player is huge.  the game play is fun and when u sneak behind someone and take them down you stab them in the throat with a knife. what else do people want aside from pointless dealth...
1254	1	a	Probably the best $2 I've ever spent on the world wide web. Who doesn't enjoy hood mounted death machines on a taxi? I for one enjoy very much what I recently spoke of.  I award this game 8 rum and colas out of 10.

3023	1	a	Knytt Underground gets the my highest personal reccommendation. I've Put almost 100 hours into the PSN and DRM-Free releases, and I know I'll be playing through a fifth time with the Steam release. The reason I can return to this game so frequently without getting bored is the world. It's the biggest game of its kind, and every single area has recieved a genuinely impressive amount of care. The story might seem inconsequential at first, but it explores some very sensitive topics with sincerity and handles its subject matter well. After you've finished the story, there's piles of ultra-challenging bonus areas and secrets to explore, too. The whole package is finished off with one of the best soundtracks in video game history, period. You can find it free on the developer's website, and I suggest you do. It's five and a half hours of outright brilliance. If exploring is your cup of tea, you should've picked it up when it first released last year.  Just a side note. It might not seem like it, but the game really does deserve that M rating. It has some serious subject matter in it that I wouldn't reccommend for kids (or for that matter, some adults).
1314	1	a	If you like to run over zombies with vehicles, get this game :D
1602	1	a	if u wanna do some exploring and doing some rebelion stuff this game is pretty good ,
561	1	a	Much better game than I anticipated, I would've never spent 20 euros on this, but I've been keeping my eye on it as the concept intrigued me. Finally got it with an indie bundle, it's been quite fun (but I still wouldn't recommend it for that price, that's just too high). I've finished Lucius in 6,6 hours according to steam (lol the coincidence), the game allows you to free roam this mansion while you think of a way to kill your quarry, Hitman style, however, it is pretty linear in it's killings, while the world is pretty much open (you can do chores and help people to be a 'good boy' or just find stuff for chapter 7 while you're still on chapter 4 (for example, I found the revolver needed for ch 7 by randomly guessing the combination to a safe)) the solution to every kill is only one. Some solutions are harder, some are smarter, there's a fine line between freedom and story in what could be called an Adventure game, because it all boils down to you living a story and having no impact to the main events. That of course eliminates any incentive for a replay, except for the final part that has 2 endings, both which I found enjoyable, but one is better story-wise. Overall it was a fun experience for the 4,50 Euros, like following a film + adventure game, of course I wouldn't spend more than that on it, mainly because, if you have your witts with you, then the game will be over soon.

2562	1	a	Ohh my fahcking GAWD, I did it, I actually did it, I FINISHED THE GAME. Somehow someway after NUMEROUS crashes, freezes, and playing 99.99% of the game with what I didn't know was bugged out aiming, I fahcking did it! I think this game is mesmerizing but first a few questions to determine if Deadly Premonition is right for you!  Do you enjoy quirky games? Do you like the TV show 'Twin Peaks'? Do you enjoy games that are rough around the edges?  I'd say, if you answered yes to 2 of those questions you should definitely find a way to play this game. It has a great storyline, funny albeit intriguing dialouge, decent gameplay and an absolutely fantastic OST. However be warned this game can be a FAHCKING nuisance due to the terrible programing/coding that was implemented especially for the PC version.   Keep in mind that this game has a BOATLOAD of problems but it is also a better experience than most 'AAA' or 'Indie' games out there!  ****TIPS FOR RUNNING DEADLY PREMONITION**** I am using Windows 8 btw.  If the game crashes at start up----&gt;look for redist folder and find the PhysX_Syssoftware installer and run Repair on it If the game constantly crashes WHILE playing----&gt; Try rebooting your system after exiting or disabling Steam overlay for the game or Run in Windows 98 Compatibility mode If the aiming is extremely limited (ie. Only can aim within a small rectangle on the screen like i did for 99.99% of the game, lol)---&gt; Run in windows 98 compatibility mode  ALSO sometimes deleting the game and reinstalling helps but it is not as reliable as just running in Windows 98 mode.   Hope these tips help and happy gaming !
1599	1	a	I had some pretty low expectations for this game. Virtually every critic seemed to hate it. And I get it, it's a pretty generic shooter with a lot of half-executed ideas. But what's there is fun. A ridiculous plot sets up some big set pieces, but for the most part you're free to roam around a section of the city and slowly liberate areas - which makes traversing around as a trespasser much easier. Stealth is handled competently and the gun play is fun, albeit shallow. The best parts are definitely scouting out locations and climbing rooftops to figure out how to recapture occupied areas.  For around $10 on sale, this game is a neat shooter with some memorable moments.

5377	1	a	 Early Access Review
1470	0	a	***Never ever buy this game***  Feels like it is still in Beta, however it has been sold and marketed as complete. This game is now so broken that it will freeze or black-screen within about 5 minutes of play. Sometimes publishers will push a game to be release too early and put way too much pressure on the developer. That could be the case here, howver since the patches have now made the game completely unplayable I'm leaning towards total incompetence as the main cause. Here are some of the persistant issues: - Pressing or spamming *Enter* will sometimes not skip logos upon startup despite displayed message stating to do so. - Game black-screened with continuing audio, after opening cinematic on first try. - Awkward and dysfunctional parkour. Dambuster Studios could take some lessons from Assassin's Creed. - Bad AI. NPCs have a habit of trapping you in a corner or blocking a doorway. - Can't do the Car Park Chop Shop mission due to a bug with the motorcycle dyno which results in the rollerdoor not opening. - Gameplay completely stalls on the Power To The People mission, meaning that you can make no further progress in the game. Only option is to restart from the beginning with a random chance that it may happen again. - Light outside of doorways is too blinding and washed out to see a KPA target shooting at you. - NPCs clip through each other, the ground, and other objects. - NPCs will come and stand in front of you just as you pull the trigger on your RPG resulting in their death and possibly your own. - NPCs in your squad act like they're on an invisible bungie cord and will stand so close to you that they can push you off a ledge. - Patches are reminiscent of DayZ, where every patch makes something worse. - Developer wants to expand the game in the future so it's quite likely that more features will be broken in the future.  *Edit: *Now that the game has been 'patched' you can expect more frequent black-screening, even on the introductory level. *The frame rate is so bad after the introductory level that it stutters worse than Michael Palin (as Ken Pile) in A Fish Called Wanda.  *Edit: *The latest 2.0 patch has resulted in a weird stuttering issue related to the running mechanics. Also seen in running NPCs. *For some reason they've spent time adding 2 new maps for the 3 players that still play resistance mode.

1455	0	a	...First off I'd like to say I'd like to see the folks at Damnbusters try again at a game. There's a few good bits in here, but as a first attempt... should've tried something not as ambitious.   Now I paid half price for this game. But as is, I don't think I can say it's worth that much.  It's pleagued with so many technical bugs. in the first hour of being in the open world I fell through the world twice and rode a bike through a wall 3 times.  Now design wise I see so much missed potential. It is so easy to avoid enemy patrols and if you have weapons out in the yellow zone(where you're suppose to blend in with civilians) I noticed no difference between if they see you waving around a rocket launcher or if you're just walking around. And I see where just living in one of these zones could be something. In fact it almost looks like that might've been a thing. And while I like the Farcry style capturing outposts, in this case it just seems played out. Like they try framing it in different ways so it's not all the same, but the reasoning for them is rather shaky.  Story... oh the story... it starts off kinda nice. but after a little while, it just falls down on its face. The people who have legitimate concerns about the reprocucions of your actions are just brushed aside as weak willed. If they object to questionable things the resistance does? Bleh, they're just not dedicated enough. Just a bunch of weak justification for calling the resistance good. I so want to spoil so much, but for those who decide to go ahead and play it I wont. Let me just say the ending... it needed work.  In the end... I wanted to like this. I steered away from the first one because it seemed a bit 'my country tiss of thee' for my liking. From what I saw from this before I played made it seem more like you're fighting for people rather than a country. Kind of dissapointed on that part as well. I really wanted to like this. But while I may revisit it from time to time, I can't advise you to buy it. Strong begining, but I can tell they crunched to meet the deadline.  If nothing else, they've inspired me to make my own game.
2842	1	a	May not work right out the box kind of game. DPFix was a pretty big help when it first came out on steam and continues to fix things so I would recommend getting that. The game itself finally comes with controller support and patched a few bugs which really hindered the game. Interestingly enough this game was tested with windows 98 and if you have serious problems you may want to put it in compatibility for win 98.   Probably the weirdest game I have played in a long time. It is a budget game and has its moments of being cheesy and surprisingly good. Mixed on the gameplay aiming is like resident evil 4, hilariously bad driving and annoying qtes. Nothing challenging about the game except maybe getting it work especially when it first came to PC. I enjoyed the game enough where I would probably play it again.

1504	1	a	This game seems to be a bit of a mixed bag for a lot of people. I personally love this game though... would strongly recommend if you like any of the Crysis games' gameplay/graphics. The only downside I have with this game is the optimization, which, quite honestly, isn't all that good... I can run nearly all the latest games on Ultra @60fps so my PC isn't the issue here. I tinkered with The Revolution's graphical settings a bit and finally found the optimal one which stays at @60fps 95% of the time, which is great! Didn't even have to go all the way to Low settings, fortunately... but then again, I shouldn't have to do that when my PC has the power to run it at Ultra quite easily. I will list some of the pros and cons below (That I think make the game good and bad)  PROS: - Good gameplay/combat -Beautiful and immersive environments -Awesome weapon customization (about customization in cons) -Cool concept for a game -Day and night cycle -Lots of free-roam content --------------------------------------------------------------------- Cons: -Bad/stupid enemy AI -repetitive sidequests -Bad optimization (I hope they'll release more stabilizing patches) -Lack of weapon customization parts -The game could use more weapons overall. -Re-appering character models w/ body parts switched ---------------------------------------------------------------------- If this review helps you, leave it a thumbs up. Thanks! :)
1565	0	a	Frame rate was fine for me but the game feels like a clunky version of Far Cry.
1682	1	a	This game might've had issues in the past, and like many i was put off by bad reviews. This was a game i wanted to play since it came out because i liked the concept and how they made their second game an open world one. I've played about six hours so far and i'm actually very satisfied. I haven't felt the 'need' to come back to a single player game since skyrim. Aside from the 'lack' of weapons you can actually buy and some questionable AI sometimes the game is solid. I guess you could compare it to far cry in some ways, since it's open and it let's you plan ahead but keep in mind that you'll mostly be fighting in urban areas. The tone and atmosphere of the game is pretty much what took me by surprise. Definitely worth it if you like the genre. Sometimes you gotta go past reviews to see the true potential of things for yourself.
2216	1	a	The games missions may not be the best, but the general gameplay and free-roam possibilities, as well as the gunplay, customization and world progression area really keeping me hooked on playing.  Short Version: Pros - Graphics are amazing. Free Roam is excellent. Gunplay and customization is very good. Variety of things to do in the world keeps things interesting.   Cons - AI could be improved. There are *some* bugs. Aim Tracking seems a bit off. In Game cutscenes aren't the best. Story isn't very deep or interesting.  All in all, I'm really enjoying playing. I'm 8.3 hours in, and I intend to play a great deal more. I have more fun in the freeroam than doing the campaign missions, and this will most likely be where I put most of my time in the game.  In depth:  Pros -  -Graphics are amazing, providing your PC can handle them. I know there have been some issues with performance, but so far I haven't encountered many issues.  -Free Roam World is excellent in my opinion. There's always something going on. The patrols are well placed. Red Zones are hectic and war like, with yellow zone activity being more based on stealth. The balance of human enemies and drones is well handled, with the enemies managing to be challening without being unfair.  -Gunplay and customization is very good. I've had a whole lot of fun with the feel of the guns and the customization, and the progression of these systems is well handled with points being unlocked for completing actions in the world. The attachment and conversion system is very interesting, and allows you to have a large amount of tactical options available whilst only carrying 2 primary weapons and a pistol. Recoil feels good and is countered by the grip and sight attachments, as well as the weapon upgrade system.  -Variety of things to do in the world keeps things interesting. There are plenty of mini objectives to complete in the world. From doing side missions such as taking down patrols and photographing enemy agents and drones, to capturing bases, destroying strongholds and saving the people from enemies.  Cons - -AI could be improved. Sometimes I do find that the AI aren't very smart. There can sometimes be no reason behind when they hide, and when they push up and attack. Whilst this keeps the AI unpredictable and interesting to play against, it can lead to them making some stupid moves, such as running up a staircase in a line to be killed one by one. I haven't had much of a problem with bad AI, but it is noticable. -There are *some* bugs. I haven't encountered many graphical or game breaking bugs, but I have noticed some. The 'free running' movement system sometimes seems strange. Some times you may grab ledges, and sometimes your character may miss them completely leading to you falling to the ground hurting yourself. This can sometimes be annoying, but isn't game breaking. The majority of bugs I have encountered are audio bugs, with some non-major audio such as music and background effects muting themselves during cutscenes, however they soon return and haven't had too much of an effect on gameplay. -Aim Tracking seems a bit off. You can easily tell this game was made for consoles first and foremost. You can't rebind some keybinds, such as holstering your weapon, which is essential in blending in and is stuck bound to the '0' key. Aim assist starts on by default, and leaves the mouse feeling sluggish, and is best turned off. Also sometimes you can take shots with your weapon that very clearly hit, but will not register. It's unknown why this occurs but it's noticable with most weapons. Whilst this only happens rarely, you don't want to be shooting a rocket launcher at a truck, only to have the hit not register and you die because of this bug. -In Game cutscenes aren't the best. The models can sometimes seem desynced and animations aren't the cleanest for a cryengine game. However, this can be ignored and doesn't take away from either the story or the gameplay. Overall I don't really count this as a drawback, as I'm more interested in the free-roam gameplay than the story, but if you are majorly into your storytelling, this may annoy you. -Story isn't very deep or interesting. Whilst the game takes some time to put a gun in your hands, which feels quite nice and well paced, you spend most of the start of the game with people talking down to you like a baby in a pram, whilst your silent protagonist lets himself walk into strange situations that don't seem to really progress the story. For example *spoilers*, your taken hostage by your own people, and have to sit through a cutscene for about 5 minutes that doesn't really add anything. One word from your character would skip it, but instead you have to sit through bad animation and pointless storytelling for the sake of it. Whilst only a minor issue, I still found this annoying.

418	1	a	Ok, so I usually play console games and have just recently turned to the 'Pc master race' and this is one of the first games I have had to play with keyboard and mouse. The reason I start by saying this is that all I've been seeing, here on steam, is people complaining about the controls. So, how does the game feel is a good question. The answer, to a non-traditional keyboard and mouse player, is pretty well, there are a few moments later in game where I needed to use my right hand to hit number keys as I used my left hand to control movement, but other than that no probs.  Another thing is I see people saying that the game is a buggy piece of bleep, and though that is subjective most people take that as a warning sign. I'm not going to say this game is the most polished thing ever but it sure isn't what people are making it out to be, and I did encounter a few bugs such as my journal not updating halting progress, and I got stuck on some clutter behind the bar. Sure that sounds bad but a simple restart of a checkpoint and you should be good.   Then on to how it looks, and I'm fully aware this is personal opinion but I think this game is stunning, the animations in cinamatics aren't the best but they're on par with some AAA games I've played.   So to story then, I suppose if you couldn't gather this from everything to do with the game you play Lucius a spawn of Lucifer (the Devil) and you're killing everyone, in a Hitman-esq playstyle mixed with evil powers. It's like a mix of the Shining and the Omen, and thats a really good thing. And the game offers alternate endings which all wrap the story up well. Heads up if you are Catholic or Christian and are easily offended you may want to pass on this one.   As my first real pc game I thought this was a very good start, and for the price of 20 bucks I feel (pardon this horrible phrase) that I really got my moneys worth. So check this out guys, ya just might like it!
1461	1	a	The first word that comes to mind while playing  Homefront: The Revolution , is 'atmosphere.' I'm a fan of atmospheric first person shooters, and I was recommended this game by someone who said it felt like  S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl . For you fellow STALKERS, I can't quite say it hits the spot completely, but it scratches that itch better than many other games. I recommend playing on the highest difficulty setting for best results.  Truth be told, this game scratches a lot of itches. I understand why it was critically panned: there are obvious technical and performance issues, the story is a bit obnoxious, and the characters are almost completely unlikable. But, it's far from being the 'worst game ever made' that some reviewers labeled it as. The gameplay here is prime. Depending on which 'zone' you're in, it sits somewhere between  Freedom Fighters ,  S.T.A.L.K.E.R.  , and  Deus Ex , with elements of  GTA: San Andreas ,  Terminator  and  Half-Life 2  thrown in for good measure. It has all the gameplay notes of a cult classic.  In the 'Red Zones' feel most comparable to the  Terminator  series' machine war scenes. The oppressive KPA army (the enemy in  Homefront: The Revolution ) patrols these zones with airships and drones that force you to crawl beneath rubble and ruined buildings to stay undetected and safe. The sound design, music and lighting in these areas are excellent, and create a constant sense of unease. I found myself cautiously peeking out from under cover to look for the telltale green search beams of the airships. The sound they make is... unsettling. One Red Zone even features a  Metro: 2033 -like gas mask mechanic, and although it honestly doesnât impact the gameplay much (other than changing the visuals and sound a bit), it does go a long way towards making the game feel more hostile.  In the 'Yellow Zones' things feel closer to  Half-Life 2  and  Deus Ex . Trash and torched cars litter the streets, and people live in extreme poverty. KPA soldiers and vehicles patrol the streets in more formation, and individual officers harass civilians (much like the civil protection in  Half-Life 2 ). In these areas, you need to cause civil unrest by secretly sabotaging KPA propaganda equipment while remaining undetected. Itâs thrilling to observe guard patterns from out of sight, and move your way through these areas stealthily.  While it may not be a perfect masterpiece,  Homefront: The Revolution  has extremely strong cult appeal. For the average gamer, this probably doesnât mean much, but for people looking for something out of the ordinary, I highly recommend giving this a try. If youâre not sure, pick it up on sale like I did.
1743	0	a	Refunded; a stuttering mess!
2000	1	a	Lack of technical polish (a beta release?) and cheesy main characters (and voice acting in places) let down some strong world building design and inventive gameplay - difficult to recommend at full price (Â£40!) but definitely one to look at in the sales....
2265	1	a	I bought this game for the sole purpose of playing a CRYENGINE based co-op title that isn't free-to-play.  For me the game certainly delivers what I was hoping for being hands down the best looking co-op game I have played so far.  IMO it technically wipes the floor with most of the other recently released titles in terms of realtime calculated graphical output and fidelity. From the shading of the effects, over to the filtering of the shadows, down to the way that huge co-op suburban area is being spammed with omnidirectional shadowcasting pointlights (down to the 'glow-sticks' that also cast shadows).   When running this game maxed out on Ultra settings, it is a pleasure to look at (even bullet tracers from Players and AI are lighting up the environments).  To me this game looks better clientside in co-op mode than most other titles in Singleplayer and I totally don't get why it gets so much hate for the visuals while other mediocre looking games get praised for theirs...  Dambuster Studios &amp; Deep Silver: Whatever you plan for future updates for this game... DON'T DOWNGRADE THE VISUALS of the game on maxed-out settings !!!  People should stop expecting major graphical progress in PC Gaming without having to invest into new hardware, providing the required horsepower to render those new next-gen environments.  I am enjoying the short and varied Co-op missions using the .50 caliber Sniper Rifle most of the time.  The netcode feels smooth and responsive.  Upgrading your character's skills, weapons and outfits feels fun.  I haven't touched the Singleplayer Campaign yet but the Co-op part translates to an '90 out of 100' for me.  Here some of my gameplay footage on which this review is grounded:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKJgUuZO6nM 
1976	0	a	To anyone who loves a true single driven story mode game, this game is honestly not for you. The beginning of the game fools you at first with its nice intro but then completely loses its edge when it goes upon your first mission and goes down hill from there... if you want a game that is a clone of 'the division' go on.... keep playing or buy this game...if you want something more fun...look someplace else and save 60.$ of your hard earned money.

2057	1	a	I havent played this game long enough to comment on the gameplay yet and will update later, however I'll comment on the visuals and optimisation on the game after an hour of gameplay. I've managed to max out everything apart from shadows and it runs flawlessly on my gaming laptop Gtx980m i7 4810MQ (3.8GHZ when turbo boosted. I am really not sure why some people with a GTX970 are getting issues with fps and I saw someone claim their GTX970 cannot achieve more than 30fps with low settings! Well, this isnt the case for me at all, the game is running superb. Anyone who has played crysis before will feel the similarity with the weapon customization (cryengine). Graphically this game is pretty good but nothing ground breaking.

But sadly homefront the revolution suffers from the same problems as the last game such as poor optimisation, controls, AI and audio quality. However it is a solid first person shooter when it runs. Hopefully they patch this game soon so i can actaully play it
1586	1	a	  Played this on a free weekend.  I enjoyed the game and will continue to play it when I have time. It has a great open world full of a dark atmosphere, Its mechanics are very like Far cry 3.  The game still suffers with hanging and a few glitches like textures not loading on surfaces and NPC ect.  The frame rate was always above 60fps with everything on very high(2xsmaa + txaa 60%) except shadows, shading and shadows res.  Fx 8350 4.0ghz GTx 970 (OC to 370mhz more) 16Gb 1886

1674	0	a	It runs like complete garbage for how it looks, and like most poorly optimized games, lowering the graphics settings doesn't do much at all. My PC exceeds the recommended specs, yet at absolute minimunm settings I can barely pull a stuttery 40fps. FoV is capped at 65 vertical for no good reason, â¥â¥â¥â¥ filters all over the place that can't be disabled, janky controls obviously designed for a console, and mediocre gunplay set to an incredibly idiodic story make this a disappointingly bad game. It might have been worth it for five bucks on sale just to play TimeSplitters 2's campaign on PC, but unfortunately this game is crippled by a disgustingly bad business practice:  Denuvo, and all that brings. No doubt one of the bigger reasons for my â¥â¥â¥â¥ performance, and a draconian DRM that requires constant online validation via their servers. The game cannot be played offline, and any hardware/software changes require you to revalidate as if you just bought the game. When Deep Silver stops caring about this game, it stops being playable. That is completely unacceptable. Stop treating your paying customers like thieves.

But it still one of the best games I've played. Intriguing story, charismatic characters and dence atmosphere is what makes the game this great.  About technical part of the game. The following quotes says it all: 'I would drag my balls through 10 miles of broken glass just to play another 20 mins of this game's story. ' Steam user jerry.   If you are willing to fight the glitches and crashes, you would experience everything that makes this game so great.

1622	0	a	Better than previous game, but still not enjoyable and monotonous. It had potential but...they ruined it.
2281	1	a	Nice graphics, nice animations, stupid AI (like really stupid). This just confirms what people already said. Devs seem to be busy with purchasable contents, so the minor bugs such as getting stuck nearly everytime you try to jump off a building are most likely not getting fixed anytime soon. Singleplayer story mode is quite fun, but after 2 hours playing it becomes pretty dull. Multiplayer is poor and dead - 6 different missions, 5 types of upgradable weapons, loads of wearable gear pieces and an extraordinarily long waiting time. It's not one of the games you can play all day, but also it's not completely boring. The setting is actually really cool though.  Conclusion: If you aren't a hard to please player, which means you don't mind pig-brained Koreans standing against you and Americans with the intelligence equivalent on your side, you might enjoy this game just as I do. If you make enough money, go ahead, get it and have fun, but it's not the game you'd want to spend your last 50â¬ on. But yeah, I like it.
1513	0	a	Awful story line, awful missions, awful side quests. The main mission and the plot can be extended and filled with more interesting stuff, incuding fights in developed urban areas(green zone) or on the airships which can make people feel comfortable compared to the tiring 'wasteland' style in the end. Every character is dumbass. The characters presented neither side missions nor interesting deveploment during the main missions, meaning you don't really feel anything about them except:'stupid''crazy''dumbass'.

239	0	a	Bad game. Also has glitched aim.
2007	1	a	Short version, it's a solid game that is fun to play, has mediocre at best voice acting, a semblence of a plot and a few graphical glitches. While fun to play it feels like it needed another month or so of play-testing before release.  (For reference, I'm running an i5 3770k with two 660Ti in SLI, on lowest settings it was perfectly playable, anything higher gave input lag of up to .5 seconds. FPS was constant except for ~.5 second freezes when saving, which were never at bad times.)  Long Version:  Pros; -Fun map to explore -Beautiful environments -The weapon customization system gives you options, and due to the time it takes to change the weapons it asks the player to think about the combat situation before entering it -Dodging between buildings in a 'red' zone while avoiding Nork patrols and the Airships (robot sky whales, no, really) is very fun -Moving through an occupied 'yellow' zone while dodging patrols and cameras is also fun -Seeing the 'effect' that the player character has on the environment is nice. It goes from dodging patrols and hiding to walking down the middle of the road over the course of liberating a zone.   Cons: -Very mediocre voice acting -Unoriginal/predictable characters and plot -Rare minor graphics glitches (a few people floating 1-2ft off the ground, etc) -Variable AI, sometimes dumb sometimes ok. The flying drone AIs were very poor and would sometimes try to fly into a building and get stuck or run into walls and explode, but to be fair I've worked with real life drone autopilots and our real world ones aren't much better. -The motorbike is super glitchy and not very useful in the environment. I found several bikes embedded in objects and died twice just getting off the bike.  Overall: I liked the game. The story and characters were meh but the fun of running through the city and liberating the zones was why I got it, and for me it was worth it. The glitches were never game breaking and easy for me, at least, to overlook. I'm ok with the $60 price tag since I got much more play time from this than a call of duty title (I mostly do single player stuff), but it's up to you if you want to wait for a sale or not.

1912	1	a	Look in the dictionary for the word 'underrated' and you will see a picture of this game. Nothing more needs to be said.
1497	1	a	I have heard that this is the worst FPS, and that it sucks, and it is bad. I played it in the free weekend, and I got to say, that if you think this is the worst FPS, you frankly have not played many games. For me, this is above average. I really enjoyed the feeling of hopelessness, and the rebellion aspect. Im going to pick this up soon on the winter sale, but do not let mixed reviews deter you. It is better than you think.  EDIT: Just recently bought it, and so far, it is really good. Is it the best game of all time? No. Is it the worst? No. Does it have great shooting, ideas, and gameplay? Yes it does. I say pick it up on a sale. This game is great at making you feel a part of a revolution and does guerilla warfare well, even though the AI is dumb at times. The game feels like Far Cry in an urban setting. The red zones all feel like something out of terminator with less robots. Also, some people say Norks is a dumb word. It actually was used in the Korean war when speaking about North Koreans, so the devs did their research, but most people do not know that. Pick it up if you like Far Cry but want a more atmospheric game and feel more like an underdog.
1351	1	a	Haha, epic fun. Don't expect anything too expansive though, comparable to web games
1948	0	a	  Homefront: The Revolution is a game I've been interested in since it was originally announced. After playing the first game in the series in 2011, I was impressed by what I initially saw in the sequel. Although the game is a huge improvemant over the original game in terms of ideas, it's still not a good game. The main character's are sort of cookie cutter and not very well developed. The story is shallow, not well thought out, and in the end feels unimportant. The world design is boring and doesnt feel alive or real. The A.I. in this game is terrible. Strange scripting, like npc's hitting walls with melee weapons for no reason. The gameplay is 'ok' but feels outdated, the gunplay could have been a lot better. I really believe if this game came out 10 years ago (minus the modern graphics obviously) people really would have liked it. Sadly this game doesn't meet todays standards.  The optimization leaves a lot to be desired and I experienced frame drops/hitching/stuttering throughout my 10 hour playthrough of the game. This was on a 980 Ti mind you. I understand performance used to be worse before the latest update, but in my opionion it's nowhere near where it should be. I have seen worse though. Your experience may vary.  This game does have things I really liked. The graphics in some environmonts were great. The game also features a great gun customization resembling the one featured in the 'Crysis' series. There was some great character design throughout the game. I was very impressed by the way faces looked in this game as well. Besides the terrible animations, the characters looked real. The game does have a lot going for it, just not enough...  Overall I really think this game should have had A LOT more work. I know people don't like to hear this, but this game really should have been pushed back farther for optimization and gameplay improvements. I really feel this series and game have/had a lot of potential. This series and gamers deserve better.

3090	1	a	This is easily my favorite video game (I'm a casual gamer). I am most impressed by the unification of the narrative, graphic design, and soundtrack--it all meshes as a Gesammtkunstwerk. I highly recommend downloading the free soundtrack (approx. 4 hours of music) if you like glitchy, atmospheric electronica (this has become my go-to work soundtrack; I do a lot of writing, and it's a great, unobtrusive soundtrack). The Knytt world is pretty vast with tons of caverns to explore. Even though I've completed the game (by paying the gatekeepers before the bells--I'm working on doing it by circumventing them), I continue to play for a bit in the evening simply because I find the combination of the visuals and the music so relaxing. If you enjoy puzzle/platformers, and you appreciate artistry in your games, this is most highly recommended.

548	1	a	If 'Hitman 2' had taken place in the early 1970s with a charming 6 year old boy you would have LUCIUS. Gameplay is very reminiscent of the early 'Hitman' series in which you pull off murders (making them appear as accidents) in order to reap souls for Satan. There is so much more to this game and a lot more forward-thinking than anything in the 'Hitman' series. Planning is key along with some 'just the right time' scenerios to allow you to fly under the radar for some time. Pull daily chores like cleaning your room, which you can do via telekinesis as you gain unholy powers as you progress; help out the mechanic or gardener or kill some charming employees, friends, and family members. This game is definately worth the $3 I got it for and it will be remembered and replayed for ages to come.

1961	1	a	I want to be brief and open. This game was not as good as I hoped it would be. I still recommend it if the idea excites you. I loved the first Homefront. This was not as good. I have not played it since the first month after it came out - it was glitchy, but fun. I had fun playing this game. That's what games are for.

2691	1	a	This is my 2nd favorite game. My first game is Zombies Ate My Neighbors for thr SNES.   Im hard to impress with any game past the early 2000's so that says something.   Yea, I'm basically a retro hipster â¥â¥â¥ or whatever they're called.  Edit: I do recommend this game and I ask that people please upvote this so others can see what issues there are. I don't care about uprates on steam or whatever it's called. I don't even understand why people say +rep. I just don't want someone to buy this and then have the same issues I'm having as well as the rest of the players who own this. You can see all the issues just by visiting the community hub and seeing all of the people who have this and other issues. Also the issue I'm about to explain has never happened to me until a week or so ago and I've owned the game since October of 2014 I believe. Seriously view the community hub or read whats below this long boring explanation so you can see what you'll be getting yourself into if you decide to buy this game.  P.S. I bought it on sale for $4.99 so I don't feel like an idiot for buying a game that's buggy as fk compared to paying $24.99 for it which it isn't worth IMO because of all the issues.  I cannot get this game to run whatsoever anymore. Whenever I click play it immediately says 'dp.exe has stopped working' and 1 second or less after that is switches from trying to find the solution to 'close/cancel'.   I have uninstalled and reinstalled the game, verified the integrity of the game cache, I have even watched several youtube videos watching people fix it by clicking on properties - local files - browse local files and then only to see that for some reason no matter how many times I reinstall the game I am missing 3 files inside the local files where you can find the .exe to launch the game aka the binaries folder basically. I ended up downloading dpfix 0.9.5 but that didn't help at all. After downloading the dpfix 0.9.5 I have all the files and tried to start the game. Crashed same as before. I followed the video showing me what to do with the files that I now have. Crashed again the same as before. I've been told that downgrading my nvidia drivers or graphics or whatever it is by 5 updates or so might help but I haven't tried that yet because I just don't feel like doing that atm. I've done several other things but they've slipped my mind atm. If I remember them I will come back and add them.  Link to one of the youtube videos I watched -         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Deadly Premonition Directors Cut Crash Fix&nbsp;
1703	1	a	Homefront: The Revolution is an excellent game. While it brings virtually nothing new to the table, it combines various elements of game series known and loved by many, including similar social stealth elements reminiscent of Assassin's Creed, and the enjoyable gunplay and customization of Crysis. It also bears tribute to Far Cry in the capturing of various outposts and 'towers'. What really makes this game shine, however, are the stunning visuals, which really bring the battered city of Philedelphia to life. The game especially shines at nightime, and if it's raining. There are some bugs, mostly related to AI Pathfinding and some animation errors (Characters getting stuck in T-poses) but overall, it's a fairly polished game with acceptable optimization. Creds to the developers, as this game was in development hell for a long time. A solid 7/10.

2441	1	a	Reporting a successful completion. It took me mind-boggling 141 hour, longer than any game so far. The ride has been excruciating at times, but mostly fun and oh-so-exciting! I thoroughly enjoyed the dark and gritty atmosphere, uncompromising and flagrant with its blood-chilling displays of human decadence. I love how rough the game is, with no immersion-breaking silliness like quest compass and highlighted levers, common to many modern 'streamlined' titles. Instead, this game targets the no-nonsense old-school player that does not expect to be spoon-fed. And it is glorious. The general sense of paranoia and imminent doom permeate at all times, and feel rather genuine. This is something few titles can be proud of. The writing is top-notch, the look and feel befitting, the difficulty finally done right. The setting and system are original, so you'll see no fireball spells, Dwarfs, Elves and other utterly overused and abused tropes.  On the other hand, numerous problems exist, spearheaded by the occasionally unpleasant amount of filler-content. Additionally, there is a visible lack of progression in rewards - items you get in the first Act are the best in the game. It doesn't help that items are randomly spec'd making them feel ultimately unimaginative and underwhelming. There is also a visible lack of low-level crowd-control spells and tactics, which is a serious hindrance in a game constantly exposing the player to fights against hordes of enemies. This makes kiting the only applicable tactic sometimes rendering the fights slow and boring.  ** IMPORTANT ** It is relevant to know that playing a priest makes the experience better as priests require the least amount of stamina and are not as dependent on weapons, so backtracking to towns and stockpiling potions are not as big issues as with other classes. If you (loosely) follow this guide, your character is guaranteed to be a powerhouse:  https://www.gog.com/forum/inquisitor/how_to_build_a_priest_in_hard_mode   Still, when all is settled, the game was a very solid experience for me that I wholeheartedly recommend. It is obviously a labor of love and deserves your attention.

337	1	a	First off, let me start with who I am. I'm a rare bird in the gaming world being a middle aged female with a career and the usual middle age responsibilities. This lends me to games which don't require hours of controller practice, though there is the occassional first person shooter I enjoy, eg, Red Dead Redemption.   Lucius is an adventure game of the Myst genre with well integrated puzzles to solve but no real controller work. The puzzles are a bit too easy. I didn't have to look for a Lucius wiki. I'd give the storytelling a B+. It's a decent game to play on a slow weekend. It won't take much longer. The steam price is appropriate for this game. Worth playing but I wouldn't have been happy with it if I bought it at it's original retail price, just not much depth.

2425	1	a	Issues have been mostly ironed out. Solid campaign and Co-op.
314	0	a	Total disappointment. Graphics look great, nice evil story. Gameplay is tedious, annoying, and a waste of time.  How to play (spoilers?): run around a house. Your mom tells you to clean your room. You clean your room. She gives you another chore. Other people give you stupid fetch quests. You run around picking up clothes, or looking for a bottle of wine. You gather an assortment of random objects and you try to figure out what to do with them. And, it only saves when you kill someone. So, if you run around doing stupid chores for an hour, then you have to quit ... well the next time you play, better get ready to do chores again. (I thought people played games to escape the boredom of everyday-life activities like chores ...) You get clues which are useless - 'I should mess with this charcter'. You then proceed to try every item in your inventory to 'mess' with him, with no luck.  The killing isn't clever or fun. It's not like you have a number of choices, and you choose how and when to kill certain people. You have to kill a certain person on a certain day in a certain way using certain objects in the correct order. Don't be fooled by the beautiful packaging - it is tedious and annoying.

2197	0	a	This game is buddy, I have had to repair the cache just because the game would not load correctly. Sometimes people will be invisible, or items needed ot progress the story will disappear if you reload your checkpoint. So technically, it has a lot of issues.  The gameplay is really bland as well. The shooting seems really clunky, and i never feel like im totally accurate, and I should. It is just not crisp at all. In the 2 ish hours that I played, it just seemed like there wasn't much content whatsoever, I was doing all these story missions, but I didn't feel like I was progressing the story at all. It almost felt like the story missions where more like the side missions.   At teh end of the day, this game is just not all that much fun.
976	1	a	Quite fun. A little irritating on occasion, but all in all, worth every penny. I suggest you give it a go.
2910	1	a	It's buggy, and the zombies never make sense. The bad parts are... really bad. But the good parts are excellent. This is definitely one you want to pick up on sale. I'd recommend it at full price if the developers fixed the crashing, but let's face it, that's never going to happen.

It's another typical Ubisoft game, with a lot of the same mechanics as Far Cry 3 and 4, but whatever; it's still fun and that's why I buy games.  I also prefer games where I make my own missions and do my own thing in an open world, so this game scratches that itch. It's worth picking up on sale, in my opinion.

I'v played about 10 hours the game has its in's and outs needless to say the game isn't at polished as one can hope for but its not a flaming bag of â¥â¥â¥â¥ either, with the potential to at least appeal for a single player game. That being said Co-Op is a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t sale its mission based survial at best. The single player aspect I'd Say B+ at best.

1999	1	a	There is a crossbow, that you can turn into a flamethrower.  11/flamethrower  In all seriousness, I've been waiting 5 years for a sequel to Homefront, and this game is not it. What made the first one such a great gem? Fast paced movie like singleplayer with a great story, amazing geared koreans who look badass AF and best of all an AMAZING multiplayer experience that is a perfect balance between CoD and BF yet creative and original. Where did HF:the revolution go wrong? The multiplayer, where is the godamn multiplayer? where are the unlocks, the vehicles, the kickass weapons like the PWS diablo and the T3AK?  The singleplayer is fine as far I have played and the koreans have amazing gear, but where is the iconic PWS diablo?  After all this game has been trough(RIP thq) I think it deserves a reccommendation, but only because the singleplayer is far better then the last Battlefields and CoD campaigns.  I think they can fix the game by adding big multiplayer maps like the first one, add the same killstreak system, vehicles, unlocks, more guns, drones all the crazy â¥â¥â¥â¥ that made the first game so enjoyable.  You guys literally took the weakness of the first game and made it your strongest, make a singleplayer that last longer then 5 hours, but you forgot the rest of it that made such a good game.  my real score: 7.5/flamethrower crossbows.
1562	0	a	VERY BORING this game is so incredibly repetitive, that just half way through the storyline, you begin to wonder how much longer till you can move on to the next Steam game in your wishlist. Even the main storyline missions become inconsequential and lame. About 3/4's of the game is running around liberating strong holds and doing little acts of charity. The strongholds would be interesting, but the AI mechanics is so bad that the enemies will just run straight into your line of fire and have no strategy except to Leeroy Jenkins you anytime youre noticed. The gun custimazation feature held promise, but failed to meet expectations. You end up unlocking all the gear and weapon attachments after just an hour of play, giving you nothing to want to work up to.  Also the Sniper attachment is absoluetly useless. The battle rifle with the sniper scope is so much better. If you want to play a game like this, but done the right way, go play Farcry instead

This game is worthless without an online community, which has been nonexistant for many years. Never a single player online. This is a perfect case of what lack of promotion will lead to. This is one of the best DOTA clones in my opinion. It brought new ideas, is very pretty, sounds fantastic. Great production all around. It deserved better success. But as of now, it should not be purchased. I expect Sins of a Solar Empire will have a similar review from me...

Not bad le finale scene  Const 1. Dumb storyline. You are surrounding by stupid mates, fighting with even more stupid enemy. Add to this fight some hooray slogans, some plot twits, that you can easy predict and you've got HomefrontÂ®: The Revolution. 2. Dumb AI. Its just you against the world, sometimes your friends from rebellion will come, sometimes shoot and die. 3. Boring gameplay likes Farcry title - capturing points, hacking devices and repeat repeat repeat. Have captured the point? Ok, enemy trops will not be in this territory, and its all.  3. Random fps lags. 4. Bugs. A lot of bugs - sound bugs, invisible items, jumping bugs from moto etc.  This game shouldn't have price of 60 $. Its cool only first 1-2 hours, after you need repeat same things again. The game is funny but it doesn't have the rebellion spirit.

350	0	a	Lucius is one of those games that has a very interesting idea, but executes it horribly. This game sounded like it was going to be waaay more fun then it turned out to be.   I can't say much about Lucius, because as you can see I only have about an hour of playtime on record. I didn't choose to only play an hour, the game is just so buggy that I couldn't manage to get any farther. Half of the time I can't play because it glitches so much.   On top of all that, the whole game is very linear. The entire gameplay consist of finding the item you are supposed to find and then using it on the objective. (ex: find screwdriver click stove, wait. Find lock, click freezer, wait.) There are no paths to branch onto, and no choices the come with the game. You have to do what the game wants you to do, and you have no free will to decide yourself. The most side missions you can do is to do your chores for money.That usually involves picking up blocks and putting them in a chest.  Even the powers in Lucius cannot be used freely. Towards the beginning of the game you are granted different powers. Sounds cool right? Not really... You are told when to use that power and you can't use it any other time then when you are prompted to. With how buggy the game is too, the powers can be a hassle to use.   Another problem with Lucius is the voice acting. It's... pretty bad. Also Lucius himself lacks character. He doesn't show emotion, change his facial expression, say anything, or do anything to show that he is a character. Sure, he is possessed, but that's no excuse. I'd rather him do a cheesy evil grin then be a walking cardboard that is there to do one objective to the next.   I may have only stated negative things about Lucius this whole review, but I will say that it could be worth it if hugely discounted or in a cheap bundle. The story can be somewhat interesting and the deaths are great to watch for the sadistic side that we all have. It's not a horrible game, but it's definitely not worth the $10 price tag. Especially with how buggy it can be. I say pick Lucius up on sale ONLY if you like very linear storytelling. Oh, and also pull up a walkthrough because the game is almost impossible to figure out without one.

2819	1	a	I've loved the style of the game ever since I saw a playthrough for it. Even being spoiled for the game, the quirky and weird storyline is wonderful. The insight into characters, the odd sidebar comments from the main character, the side quests, and more, were a sure-in for me in terms of whether I should buy this. I'm a sucker for the odd, dark, weird, and gortesque so your mileage may vary in terms of how you may enjoy the story.  A few things to note in terms of game play and PC port issues that I've read about before purchasing:  I seem to have won the Russian Roulette of PC port issues. The game has only crashed on me twice so far and both times was because I didn't save for too long. On that note, I don't have the unofficial patch installed. As for the screen revolution issue, I bought the game after the official patch (v1.01b) came out, so I didn't encounter the 720p issue. It's sizable and both full screen and windowed mode works well on my 1366 x 768 screen. (The only downside is you can't change the resolution. Only tab between full screen or windowed.) If I play it on windowed mode, I have to autohide my windows taskbar for it to fit. That's about it.  Some gameplay advise (with minor gameplay spoilers) starts here. If you're the kind who likes to do sidequests and get all the side achievements or like to explore, read on! Because I had to restart the whole game because of this issue.  There are a few short story-only chapters where you can run around the game area and accomplish tasks. However, the game doesn't tell you this. You can progress through the whole story without completing the side quests at all. But if you do like to do side quests, it's best that you find a good non-spoiler walkthrough that'll tell you when and where to do what. The game has a replay function but the downside to replaying a chapter is you CANNOT save at all during the replay; with the game's tendency without notice as well as the very specific conditions you need for side quests, it can be a huge bummer.   I found this out at chapter 4 and decided to restart the whole game so I can have the chance to save between side missions. That's about it from me so far. I love the game overall and I'm just very happy to get to play it on a platform I own.

I first heard about it from a guy, who played prologue and all the the time said something like 'How glitchy it is' and 'He speaks with coffee??? What a psycho!'. He didn't play after this, but after this 'little conversation' I wanted to play this so much. So I without second thinking bougth this ASAP. And I have never regretted about it.  PS.

2553	1	a	One of the oddest videogames I've ever played. Despite having virtually no production-value and the lack of polished gameplay, it manages to stand on the strength of its gripping murder-mystery story, its weird and wonderful freakshow of characters and how aware of its own campiness it is. It's an experience like no other that I can recommend solely for that reason.  Only true downside is the PC port. Itâs awful. Downloading fan-made fixes and messing with .exe properties isn't much fun. A patch that Rising Star Games promises is on the way may fix this, but for now, just take note.  Overall, even with the shoddy PC job, its one of the most memorable games in recent memory. Highly recommended if you're into games that are a little out-there.

2136	1	a	I'm writing a review because that's apparently the thing to do with only a few hours of gameplay.  Does the game run smoothly? It has dips but it's not ruining my enjoyment. Does it have good gunplay? Yes. Actually some of the more interesting I've played lately IS IT FUN? Yes Are the weapons fun to use? Ahh, that's the golden goose in a fps isn't it? They are a riot. Everything is upgradeable and interchangeable on the fly. Your pistol can act as a silenced air powered assassin tool, a 9mm handgun, AND a .45 cal smg. You don't need to be at a workbench to change them up, you can do it during battle. Like your shotgun? Who dosen't, right? Well now you can turn it into a napalm launcher once you buy the upgrade. The versatility of weapons reminds me of the Resistance franchise on PS3 (which was known for it's insane weapons). Hows the sound? I'm not a huge sound critic but everything sounds balanced How does it look? One of the best I've seen How is the story? As I said, i'm not far in. But the KPA is obviously a metaphor for alt-history China in this Homefront (the last HF the KPA had no similarities to China). How are the controls? If you're using a m&amp;k I couldn't tell you. I am using a 360 gamepad because the BetterDS3 program bugs out in game, making my PS3 gamepad useless. I hope that gets patched. The 360 gamepad works fine. Is it stable? It hasen't froze or CTD'd yet. Should you buy it? That's up to you. I don't know why so many people are looking for someone to tell them to buy it. You're a adult (I'm guessing), act like a big boy and decide for yourself.

Unlike Hitman, you can't just pull out a gun and kill them if you can't figure out a way to stealth it, making it more of a puzzle game than an action game.  The deaths are all amusingly gruesome, with good graphics and a soundtrack that sounds like Danny Elfman. It's a bit buggy but the missions are short so restarting them due to a glitch isn't a big deal.

Games have changed and advanced, many scores are based on replayabilty, the scope of the enviroments, and freedom of variation in how to go about things. That's all superb standards to go by today, in open world/sandbox games. However, there is something to be said about restriction in games. With freedom of choice can also come a certain stress, and a sense of incompletion. There's the time and place for both, naturally, but some times there is something soothing and satisfying about playing a game the only way it's meant to be played.  'Lucius' is about exploring your surroundings and figuring out how the puzzles are solved. Sometimes the solution is far fetched, sometimes ridiculous. But all in all, there's some sort of logic there. I enjoyed this game far more than I probably should have. I liked it's simplicity, the house and garden, the idea of it all. Granted, there was much more potential behind the concept that was left unrealised, but for what it was, I enjoyed it.   Shiver Games tried to respond to peoples objections and critique to this first game somewhat in the sequel, which I can't speak of as I haven't played it, but, it did seem like that game have fallen apart in them trying to do so. It was probably more somewhat what they wanted the first 'Lucius' to be; being able to have access to a variety of tools to make death traps, lethal situations and weapons to off any number of roaming NPCs at any given point. From what I've read and seen though those ambitions resulted in a broken game with great potential. The more complex, the more wrong things can go.  'Lucius' has its fair share of bugs and limitations. But it also has a great idea behind it, and for me personally, finally getting the kill I was going for was surprisingly satisfying, as was achieveing 'good boy' status by doing mundane chores around the house. My guess is, if you get some self therapy by say, doing the dishes or painting the fence, you might enjoy this game. Get it on sale though.

Another bug Made a new a game and some how got spawned on the last level checkpoint. Achievements that i have not completed are unlocking from doing nothing. The voice acting is on point! and the weapon conversion is pretty dope along with adding attachments!
1649	1	a	It's fun. I played it for about 8 hours so far and never before patch 2.0 A few bugs here and there but nothing really out of the line. I don't get the negative reviews so far. I've played some AAA titles (like A.Creed) which were hell more predictable and not as good as this. It's not a game changer but nobody ever said so. Give it a try.

2458	1	a	This game is for the hardcore only. If you enjoyed diablo, you MIGHT like this. This game is MUCH more story driven, with a much more in-depth combat and class system. You choose from 3 classes, Priest,Templar,Thief. All of which are HARD. Play the game on EASY, because even easy is HARD. I highly reccomend it. Only 9 hours in, and i barely scratched the surface.
792	1	a	The premise for this game is pretty effing fantastic. You're the antichrist. Reborn into the child of a wealthy couple. Hellbent on doing the devil's bidding and fulfilling your prophecy as a killer, you set about racking up the numbers by offing kitchen staff and houseguests alike. Highly recommended to game collectors.

460	1	a	Awesome and creative game with an eery soundtrack. There isn't much plot to the game (it's your generic Satanic horror movie story about a little kid being the anti-christ), but it's still sufficiently creepy to keep you intrigued to the very end.  Unfortunately, it is a rather short experience (I logged about five hours for my initial playthrough). Levels are fairly structured, though sometimes it can be easy to miss a certain detail and figure out what your next step is. You get several powers to use in the game, but realistically speaking, you will only use them each a few times.  I think there's room for a lot of potential here, some expansion that builds onto the story and lets you use your talents a little more creatively. But for what this game is right now, it's worth a playthrough.

3066	1	a	Good platforming, and the game runs very smoothly. But the story serves no purpose besides trying to be humerous, which in turn ruins the atmosphere. NPCs are also useless, would have been more apropriate to add deposits or holders for items in the world (i.e. making 2 holders for the candelabras, and the door would open after they were placed.) All in all fun to play, but would have been better served with a few design changes.

2941	1	a	OK, this game surely has its problem. It's a bad port, it needs some twisting around from keeping it from crashing, the driving mechanics are objectively bad, and the graphics is surely not top notch. But this game is a breath of fresh air from all the 'this game mechanics work, let's copy-paste it' games, it's extremely original and has a great late 90's early 2000 japanese vibe. It has one of the best horror plot ever seen in video game history, the character development is incredible and i was surely not expecting anything even close to this level. The english production is great, the voice acting is magnificent. The game is an open world investigation horror with paranormal elements, and it's unique in its genre. It's surely a game to try out, sadly the first 15 minutes of tutorial are not representative of the rest of the game and can turn a lot of people off before they get to the real beginning of the game. I really feel like recomending this to anyone who wants to try something different from the gaming standards we are accustomed today

518	1	a	I got this game from a bundle and I didn't expect much from it.But the game is actually pretty good if you are into clever puzzles and storyline driven games.  The graphics are ok-ish even if sometimes they seem to glitch out or look weird,I didn't pay much attention to them because the main feature of the game is the clever ways you need to figure out on how to kill people around the house.The gameplay is linear but it's not boring because it's extremely satisfying to see the cut-scenes after you kill someone.There are even some side-quests but they feel like chores..wait..the side-quests actually tell you to do your chores.  I really enjoyed going through the game.It has a captivating story and I think it is worth picking this up from a sale or a bundle even if it is only around 6-8 hours long.
299	1	a	Lucius is a third person adventure puzzler where you basically play as the kid from The Omen. You are the son of the devil and are out to kill everyone by figuring out how to use your environment and use your demonic powers, without getting caught.  The graphics are good for what it does, and the gameplay is satisfying. It also has some really gruesome death scenes. Characters act like people, they slowly grow more and more tense as their world gets worse.  Recommended for fans of horror and adventure alike.
2627	1	a	PLAY THIS GAME FOR THE BEST EXPERIANCE EVER

If you enjoy a zero challange forumalic open world game with lots of mind numbing busy work then you'll like this.  -Edit Originally I gave it a thumbs up, Now changing my review to negative since I've encountered a bunch of game breaking bugs right near the end, That wont let me progress without having to replay a massive section of the game. No thanks.
877	1	a	To Be honest i got this in the sale for a couple of Pounds, i have only just played it because i thought it looked a bit old and boring. i was not wrong, without the the help of youtube walkthroughs on some of the tasks, this game would be near impossible and my god that house is impossible to find your way around. spent a long time wandering around looking for one room and ending up in the place i started, only to get lost again. but after i got the idea and figured out the complicated ways you have to do everything it wasn't so bad and it has a good concept, i will be getting the 2nd one just to see how they have improved it and to be honest i can't wait!
1510	0	a	------------ Update  Well...itÂ´s runnning now. Not doing well, but running. Some Crashes from time to time.  Is it worth buying it? No. Maybe in a weak sales-moment...   -------------  DonÂ´t buy this now!  The performance is hell and graphic settings donÂ´t make a difference.  (i5 2500k, GTX 970, 8GB) Savegames are easily corrupted. So you are able to play again and again.  The game crashes after ~15 min of gameplay when saving after a cutscene  (Mission 'Welcome to the resistance') You are able to fix this by creating a  new user in windows. The username must not have any chraracters other then a-z. (e.g. Ã¢ Ãª Ã¶ Ã¼ will crash the game when saving).  And donÂ´t think of 'starting as user'...wontÂ´t work.  I spend more time on installation, patching and crashing then on playing.  Wait for the next patch. Or the next two, three or four....

2516	0	a	While there is nothing wrong, in and of itself, with the concepts behind this game, to say that they have been poorly executed is frankly apparent.   Inqusitor, when I started, gave me high hopes, but the hiccups began apparent within a few hours of play.  My first quest was to slay some giant bats to please teh guards, who would then let me inside.  That took me nearly forty minutes to complete a quest that should've taken ten. And if the first quest is long, boring, and requires you to walk around in empty space, hunting down every last enemy, then you have done something wrong.  While the concept of actually being inquisitive, performing basic detective work to hunt down the evil in towns was a brilliant idea, I was unable to get very far into it, having only played about an hour. The reason I stopped will be explained later.  So while I was out and about killing bats, I discovered treasure. 'Aha!' I thought, 'Basic gear that any first rank guy can wear! How wonderful, perhaps this game is salvageable!' And then after closer examination, I found that the gear in question could not be worn by anyone below level seven. This is beyond stupid. All treasure and gear must be levveld to the expectations of the level of progression that the player should be at by the time he or she gets there.  Giving level seven gear to a level one player, when you do not expect the player to be anywhere near that level, is a horrible design, regardless of where you find it. So, lacking any storage for this treasure, I prompty got rid of it by selling it. Now the market system is pretty good, with coin flowing freely and not feling too overwhelmed by ridiulous prices.  But there was another problem. Care to guess?  Over leveled equipment sold at the start of the game. You cannot use anything that is sold to you unless you are level 7. Proper design is to have the inventory of the blacksmith update as progress is made. This flaw proved to be extremely frustrating later.  So after some basic examination into murders, and some questioning of townspeople, I was told by a villager that he had been paid good gold to kill me, and so he pulled out a weapon to do just that. Which is where the second flaw became apparent.  Unbalanced enemies. In any good game the challange must scale to the player. Not so hard that the player can't win, but not so easy they become bored. Were in not for the timely intervention of the local guard, I would have been slain.  During the fight, I ran into yet another problem. Breaking weapons. Now this is NOT problematic. Provided of course that the weapon displays a stat that SAYS IF IT IS GOING TO BREAK. The weapon did not, and when it did break, I was left completely defenseless.   So without a weapon, and the bandit having a knife I was too low level to use, I set off to buy a weapon.  Only, again, to discover I was too weak to use ANY WEAPON SOLD IN STORES, LEAVING ME COMPLETELY USELESS.  At thsi point, I quit. Poor level design and balancing has completely ruined this game, which is a pity because it showed so much promise from the mechanics alone.  Do not buy this game.
2697	1	a	Zach needs COFFEE! 8/10 3$ game. Totally worth 3$! If you like horror games then you might enjoy this. Oh and you can shave your face.  People say this is a bad port and it crashes. I haven't had one crash yet. Maybe a sugar crash but thats about it.  Beware this game has alot of cut scenes!    
1606	1	a	  Free Weekend Player  I enjoyed this. It has a lot of problems with bugs and some very janky animations, but when it does get things right, the movement is very fluid. Animations are horrendous, characters look like broken marionettes and facial expressions are next to none.  It's basically Far Cry 3 but without the charm. I did enjoy the concept of fitting in with crowds in certain areas, but it fell down a lot in terms of execution. Repetitive activities peppered with flashpoint activities a la Far Cry 4's outpost defence missions, don't hinder the game too much but also don't challenge you much.  Characters are one dimensional and bland. Ethan Brady is like a less charming Gordon Freeman, which is difficult to achieve.  The weapon conversion system is a nifty idea, but you'll end up relying on one or two weapons for the majority of the game (for me, it was the SMG pistol conversion, and the Marksman Rifle Battle rifle conversion, with the Rocket Launcher for the last third of the game) simply because they are more effective.   Overall, it's not an amazing game. It's pretty mediocre really. But I enjoyed it, and honestly I'll probably buy it in the future. It's definitely not a full price purchase though. It's too bland.  5/10

I've played Diablo, where you have to chug potions fairly often as well, and this is worse than that. Much. Much Worse. If you do get this, I suggest playing it on easy so that you can get the fighting out the way faster and get to the parts of the game that are okay.

2188	0	a	Loved the first Homefront. Fighting outside a lumber liquidators with a modern enviroment was awsome. Now move onto the second game and it falls completly short. Not only can you tell the game has been passed around from studio to studio but it seems as each studio got ahold of the game they tried to cram in there special bland style. The games mechanics are dated and poor. The future tech is boring an overused. All the second game needed to do was pick up where the first one left off. The copy of every ubisoft go here kill bad guys and activate outpost is dated and boring at this point. The guns are a total let down compared to the first game. The second Homefront is a step backwards in almost every way. The devlopers took no time to add something new to the game and advance the series forward. Half the time I dont think anyone on the dev team even played the orginal game.  This is probbly the death of the homefront series and that is sad becuase a fight for Americas indapenence red dawn type game is something that is not done very often or done well. Very unexplored genre.

425	1	a	Good game with good graphics. You control a kid (the son of Lucifer) who is able to use telekinesis and others superpowers to kill people that you hate, but you have to hide your murder as an accident.   SO, use your brain and kill all these â¥â¥â¥â¥ing people you hate and improve your mind.  I really recommend this game same if your action's circle is limited.  
1466	1	a	This game was an awful mess at launch, and it still has technical issues, but I think it's mostly been patched into something with some real value.  The campaign missions are generic modern shooter stuff, but the open world has fun elements. If you're into the 'liberate regions of the map with gunplay and some light stealth' gameplay of, say, Far Cry and want it in an urban, anti-authoritarian package, you'll probably like this game. The Yellow Zones (civilian regions where you have to inspire people into joining the resistance) in particular are fun as you have to sneak and run past large patrols while doing your best to cause damage and help people.  I recommend picking it up on sale. It's probably not worth a full $60, but for any less than that it's good if this is your kind of game.  I haven't played the DLC yet, so no comment on them and the season pass.
859	1	a	One of a few games where you don't play as good character, but as bad character. Riddles are sometimes quite hard, but with using the thing, that most of us wearing on our necks, the riddles can be solved without bigger complications. Dante Manor is a big residence that's worth of exploring. Warning: Innocent people die in this game :-)  Verdict: 9/10

1691	0	a	This game wasn't too bad. This is based on my gameplay during the free weekend.   Graphics: The graphics wasn't too bad. I didnt recieve any FPS drops like other reviewers and I have a GTX 760. The detail in facial features, wet vs. dry was pretty good.   Gameplay: The gameplay wasn't the worse but it did lack storyline other than 'fight the government'. Basically you're the resistance fighting against the government thru most of the game. Each new section or you can call them chapters in the game is pretty much the same. Capture this area for communication or destroy this area to limit government supplies, etc.   Bugs: The AI was ocassionally glitchy. I was able to hide in a dumpster while KPA agents were shooting me. The AI that follow you would also block you in a corner and wouldn't move no matter what you do.... unless you reload from last checkpoint was really annoying. Certain areas of the map you could glitch it where you can sometimes get up to the next floor without going around or basically fall thru the map. There was also many times where I get stuck and wouldn't be able to move (like getting stuck between the stairs and a wall) I personally find this as a bug but it may not be but the AI can not really detect you when you're above ground level. Such as chests or radio spots above ground level.   Multiplayer: I was only about to get into 1 game. There doesn't seem to be a matchmaking system and if there is, well then people just were joining multiplayer mode.   I would rate this game 4/10. It would have to be at least 80% discounted price for me to buy it. After playing a few hours (in which like 15 was afked) I wouldn't recommend or discourage people from buying this game.
3003	1	a	If you can you should just go ahead and play the original or the PS3 version of this excellent terrible game, otherwise prepare to soldier through a lot of freezes and crashes, I did, but it took all my determination and autism to do it.   I'm proud of myself.

423	1	a	The game is good as in the gameplay and story. -Achievements are quite easy to obtain except the 'Time' achievements, 'I like this game' and 'I'm addicted' which I get to later. -It's quite linear to say the least.  -There's a side quest to do where you do these chores and you obtain an item when you, I believe, do two or three chores everytime. The most fun in the game was the item that you would get third time, the tricycle. You could literally cycle up the stairs and go faster than walking by pressing 'Shrift' to speed up.  The price to me honestly isn't worth it (18,99â¬), but I can't complain as I got it in a giveaway. -That being said, the week long deal offers 95% off as of typing this review (30/08/2015) which is a good deal.  Now onto the 'Time' achievements. It's one of the most dubious and stupid achievements I've seen yet. You basically play 20 hours to earn the first one and then 40 hours to earn the second one.  -Though the storyline is like 8 hours (For me it was 6 hours including all the achievements except the Time achievements) and if you want to complete all the achievements, an extra 1-2 hours would be the assumption.

3109	1	a	I love this game. It is the sort of thing that you can play for ten or fifteen minutes and feel like you accomplished something, or intend to play for an hour and find yourself still playing after four.  The ball mechanics are as close to perfect as you can find in a game. Importantly, there is some ability for course correction mid-air, so you are not bound to just ricocheting around based only on your bounce. And the transformation mechanic lets you move in ways that neither the sprite nor the ball could alone.  The core of the game is exploration. Puzzles are usually âhow do I get there from here?â and typically arenât more than four or six rooms. They are spread about often enough to be interesting, yet sparse enough that at no time does it feel like you just completed a difficult challenge only to be rewarded with a harder one, and in fact almost always do reward you. The rewards vary from inventory items (which may be quest related) to story exposition, and sometimes earthquakes that open up new paths elsewhere.  Death is mostly non-punishing, typically at most it resets you to the last safe position you were in, which is usually in the room you are currently in. If you collected an item just before dying, it does not reset the item. That said, you do have to then make it to a save point to keep the progress after leaving the game.  Mi, the character, is mute. When you have a conversation with an NPC, you can choose if you want your friends Dora or Cilla to answer for you. Dora is generally going to give an optimistic or positive answer, while Cilla tends to be cynical if not mean. But they can and will also surprise you.  While I very much enjoyed this game, the experience was certainly heightened by having played the developerâs previous games, which are not currently available on Steam. I think it stands alone well, however there are many references to several other games (including ones for both Knytts and the Ball) that were very cool for those in the know.  As much as a third of the gameâs rooms are hidden off-map.

1710	0	a	Homefront: The Revolution. Be sure, this game is good by itself, but if you`ll compare it to other AAA-games of the same 'type', you`ll be dissapointed.  Good Things:  1. Pretty good optimised after the patch. 2. Graphics are good. 3. Customisation is awesome. 4. Overall idea is just incredible. 5. Takedown animations are great.  Bad Things:  1. The realisation of this idea is 'meh'. 2. Actors` play is awful. 3. AI is stupid AF. 4. Storyline is boring. 5. Sidequests are boring. 6. Reloading animations are bad. 7. Overall animations and cutscenes are BAD.  At this state, i don`t reccomend you to buy this game. At first? they nedd to polish EVERYTHING and enable mod-support. Then it would be awesome.  5 Walkers out of 10 Bradies.

2563	1	a	I recommend Deadly Premonition to everyone who likes kind of weird characters, good storytelling (that takes it's time) with multiple perspectives from different points on the timeline. You should be stress resistant, because the game will probably crash just before your next save, so you will do some things twice. That should not bother you. It is a kick, because the game itself is not much of a challenge. If you can live with the flaws and see it as an Indie game you got for less than 3 bucks, it is an immersing adventure.  Since the beginning I like the habit of the main character 'York' to talk to 'Zack'. It feels like he is talking to you, the player. It is fun to see other people being puzzled by the actions of the protagonist (as talking to Zack, a person no one can see) and not asking a question. That's what you as the player do: make a list in your mind of things you want to find out and hope that you will get your answers to the right time. Or at the end, at least. Because of the way the story is told you may guess some things and resolve some mysteries for yourself, but I assume that you will still be surprised sometimes. You won't find an answer to everything in the game, like with most scary stories, but that's fine. You will get all important answers to what is important in the game's universe.  Some insights of my journey with the game: I was well aware of bugs because I read other reviews. I installed DPfix. I can highly recommend that. By doing so, crashes did not occur too often and because I saved a lot I managed to play the game without becoming depressed. ;) I can only complain about spending too much time on loading screens. Moving the game from my HDD to my SSD did not seem to boost the time on loading screens. Too bad. In chapter 7 I started to explore the vast world. I should have done that sooner (chapter 2) to have advantages in the game early on. In the first chapters you have time limits, but the game is nearly in real time, so you can do side quests. No worries. Do them! I got my radio, which allows me to drive to different locations in no time without really doing it] after chapter 21. I could have saved a lot of time, not driving myself through the world. You find information about the side quests in the game and also through the descriptions of the achievements. After you finished a chapter, you can replay it. During a replay you cannot save. A replay is nice if you want to do side quests that may be easier in that level or not doable in another. Everything you gain will be available in any other replay and also in your current game progress. A replay only changes at the end (if you save after finishing the chapter) your inventory, trading cards and the quests you finished. So if you keep dying in your current level, do a replay to get food and medipacks in your inventory. Nice cheat. :) I used the replays after I was stuck in chapter 22. I was too lazy to open the archive and therefore I did not find an important key. The game is in general, amazingly straightforward, because it shows in red where you need to go to or interact with to proceed. That is nice, as you always know what to do. (But you still have to solve the puzzles by yourself, the game only indicates where the important puzzle is.) You are never lost.  I like the chilling atmosphere of the game, the horror story itself and especially how it is told. One last hint: Don't miss to have lunch with your colleagues. Eat with them in every chapter possible. It's fun! I am happy that the reviews I read convinced me to play this (indie?) gem.

2209	1	a	I've never written a review before, but seeing all the negatives about this game, i felt i had to put my two bobs worth in. In the time ive played it, ive realised you cant play it like a normal shooter. You havent got the firepower to match for a start, so the game has to be treated with a stealth approach, avoiding rather than confronting. once you take a few zones and meet some resistance fighters, the weapons become heavier, and you can go on the offensive a bit. I'm enjoying the game, playing as a guerilla fighter, not a combat soldier. There are one ore two frustrating aspects of the game for me. 1. lack of saves are a bit annoying, but at least when you revive, you've still got your cash. 2. The enemy seem to be bullet sponges. You can hammer away at them, and they take ages to go down. I find if you buy a scope for your battle rifle, headshots do the trick. I'm givng this game a positive review, simply because i'm enjoying a lot of stealth, and a few good firefights. I've had absolutely no tech problems so far, so fingers crossed. I bought mine as a 5 disc set, because the Aussie dollar is too low to buy on Steam, but still qiuite a costly game for those who don't like it.

427	1	a	The game is good as in the gameplay and story. -Achievements are quite easy to obtain except the 'Time' achievements, 'I like this game' and 'I'm addicted' which I get to later. -It's quite linear to say the least.  -There's a side quest to do where you do these chores and you obtain an item when you, I believe, do two or three chores everytime. The most fun in the game was the item that you would get third time, the tricycle. You could literally cycle up the stairs and go faster than walking by pressing 'Shrift' to speed up.  The price to me honestly isn't worth it (18,99â¬), but I can't complain as I got it in a giveaway. -That being said, the week long deal offers 95% off as of typing this review (30/08/2015) which is a good deal.  Now onto the 'Time' achievements. It's one of the most dubious and stupid achievements I've seen yet. You basically play 20 hours to earn the first one and then 40 hours to earn the second one.  -Though the storyline is like 8 hours (For me it was 6 hours including all the achievements except the Time achievements) and if you want to complete all the achievements, an extra 1-2 hours would be the assumption.

2217	1	a	Homefront: The Revolution is a good game. It does not reinvent the genre, it does not blow you away with new, innovative features. It handily delivers you a perfectly average shooter. I personally have not experienced any performance issues (GTX970, i7-4790k on high settings) but I understand that lower performance rigs may have issues. Probably not worth $60 but definitely pick it up when its on sale.
2829	1	a	Cult favorite and holds a record of most polarizing game ever and the 'best-worst game of this generation'... Quirky, scary, weird and at some points perhaps unintentionaly comedic but perhaps that is what makes this game special. Yes It may have awkward controls and other miscellaneous problems but the PC version helps amend these so I recommend if your a fan of survival horror/ weird games or love a plot that is actually compelling and complex like this hindered-masterpiece.   Supports Window Mode. Has controller compatibility. Changeable Graphic resolution.

543	1	a	Lucius brings back the fun I remember from playing early sandbox games. The 'Story' portion of the game which takes you from start to finish is very linear. But I found a lot of times I was content to use the house as a playground for Lucius's powers instead of always immediately targeting my next victim. The game also somewhat obviously boasts quite a violent streak, almost to the point of it suffering from how extreme they are compared to the subtly in the story from the detectives perspective, and how the characters seem to nonchalantly react after 4 or 5 gruesome deaths. The game also feels a little short, even with mucking about this game is not in it for the long haul at all and with the linear story having almost no replayability that is a bit of a down-note for Lucius. Bottom Line: definitely worth getting, if it's on sale.
2058	1	a	It's so great to be back to unfold after the Golden Bridge! This Homefront 2 is inspire from orginal Homefront when North Korea invade to America.

2541	0	a	This could be one of the worst action RPG's I have ever seen. Let me start by saying the movement in the game feels like im playing something from the 90's. The combat is clunky at best. I'm just glad I got it cheap because this was a complete waste of about 20 minutes of my time.   Uninstall, and off to look for something a little more enjoyable!
1981	0	a	30 minutes in the main 'character' gets strapped to (another) chair and almost tortured by one of his fellow resistance fighters because he is immediately mistaken to be a spy.   What is his response to this?   Absolutely nothing. Because he's a silent protagonist who was going to sit there and have his nipples cut off by some chick who he is allied with. Oh, but lucky for him the leader waltzed in and checked for his ID just in time to save those precious nips.    Other than that, a 980Ti handled the game on MAX 1080p like garbage (stuttering/constant drops in FPS at 60Hz) while just running around the starting area. I have no hope for combat running smoothly.

The single player is really fun and this is one of few FPSs where you are not invincible. You actually have to know when to fight and when to run. It's not the best shooter I have played it but it's the best recent single player shooter for sure.

2059	1	a	Edit: So after a few updates, there has been basically zero improvement for framerate. My advice to anyone interested in buying this game is to try it out for the two hours you can and if you like it and performance is fine, then keep it. The game is a solid B as far as story and setting are concerned. Performance is 'meh' throughout. If it runs well in the first two hours, you'll be fine. If it doesn't run well, it won't get any better so you're better off refunding it. I just finished the game and had a good time. I'd recommend it for people who like open world shooters, but there are other games that do this formula much better and have a better story. Still fun though. Solid B.  I am not refunding this game as I think many of the issues are tech related and can be fixed in a patch or two. If you're not sure about buying this, just wait unti a patch is released. I have a 6700k with a 980ti and I haven't had significant problems, though the game isn't optimized well and has fps drops. There have also been a number of bugs in shadows, hand motions freezing, sounds not matching with voices/guns, and textures not rendering. It's not as bad as Arkham or Unity as others are comparing it, but is suffering from bugs that are annoying.   As far as gameplay is concerned, it feels like a lesser version of FC. The gunplay isn't 'addicting' as FC, but is satisfactory though it takes some getting used to.  Don't know enough about the story to weigh in on that, yet. One problem with the game is its release date. There are many games releasing this same month that are FPS and that are significantly better (gameplay wise). It's a hard sell, honestly.

Getting caught by night and game over because I must go to bed. I AM THE SON OF SATAN YOU GO TO BED MORTAL !!! Losing all objects. Picking objects. Killing. Picking objects. Being technically stuck in the court with no way of walking out of there. Loosing consciousness because a dumb player decided to stop the game and never play it again.
866	1	a	6/10  At first couple hours, I thought this game is quite boring because how the game machanic it is. It doesn't give you freely how you gonna kill. It locks how you kill, which is only one approach. You just need the right tool which can be found on the right place. and using that tool for the right object. Given that you are at a large maze mansion with multiple rooms. You have to run around and get lost very often. I feel frustrate on running around, and many occasions I have no clue what I have to do. (and then finally looking through walkthrough for that particular stuck)   I still have to no idea why you can collect the item which you can't use right now for the chapter. And then in the later chapter., you don't have go to pick the items because you have collected them already from previously chapter. I think it ruins the game machanic. (for example, in some of chapter, you have to sneak at night, and avoid to get detection in order to collect a necessary item, but.... if you have picked the item on previously chapters, then you no longer need to go.)  The game then become more interested when playing further. I mean when you get used to the game, basicly you have to do something around the target. and use some hint on your notebook to clue you what you are supposed to do. (By the way, you still get confuse what you have to do most of the time)  The story can keep me continue playing, including satisfying dead scene for every end of chapter. However, after finish the game, this game has low replayable because you've known all what you have to do, where you have to go, which spot in the room you have to use your skill on. Furthermore, the extra contents is not good to play with. It's just not polish.    Good: -The dead scene for every end of chapter can satisfy me. -Story driven is good. (I get addict on the first playthough because of this) -The game can push me too keep looking for the sequence... (but from the Lucius2 review... I don't know if I should try Lucius2 or not.)  Bad: -Too frustrate finding the right item on the right place and use it on the right object. -Mansion is too large and quite like a maze. It take you to survey around a very long time until you familiarize with. -linearity with killing method for each chapter.  btw, still recommend this game when it sale. (yep, I got this game on sale for 1 usd)

741	1	a	If you loved the movie The Omen, be it the original or the 2006 remake, then you will most likely love Lucius.  The game and story are extremely linear, and by that I mean that there are zero deviations whatsoever. So don't go in expecting you're going to sandbox murder people as a kid. You'll always be within the mansion or in the garden outside, so deal with it and the lack of side missions. There also isn't much in the way of music, but that's okay; it makes it easier to throw on some metal to set the mood.  Now, the different methods in which you execute people are absolutely visceral, however pre-conceived they may be. You get to eff up a ton of people in the game, and each person dies their own unique death. There's a decent amount of challenge involved during some of the kill scenarios, especially more towards the end of the game. Stealth is key to not getting caught at times, while other times you simply have to figure out how to lure folks to their demise. Did I mention your father, Satan, will visit you from time to time and bestow new abilities unto you for doing his bidding?  The controls can be somewhat clunky at times but it's not too awful. It's a minor inconvenience and a small price to pay for a game as unique as Lucius. It's a total Omen simulator, from start to finish. The price of $10.99 CAD is a steal for a game that will last you a good 15-20 hours, although Lucius is found in bundles quite often and has been known to go on sale for a whopping $1.00. So ask yourself... do you like horror, murder and gore? If you answered yes, this game is for you.   Rating:  4.0/5.0  - Excellent, highly worth playing.
790	1	a	Impressive game, which puts you in a skin of a child posessed by the devil. Child needs to give souls to his father - Lucifer, by creating 'accidents' that take lives of people around big mansion he is living. It is very cruel game, that shows every death in slow-mo and with maximum details. And it purely unique and very fun to play. Beaten it in one evening.

2030	0	a	Pretty mediocre shooter. I had hoped to see something different from the annual CoD iteration but they pretty much wasted the theme - liberating areas is way too easy (interact with the objective to make hostiles vanish instantly), and once you have liberated a zone you get plenty of allied redshirts, an infinite supply of rockets and will never be bothered by the KPA again. To be fair, the campaign is no worse than the annual CoD - less flashy explosions, but a slightly more original theme but then again you probably wouldn't buy CoD for the singleplayer.  Multiplayer is dead, which is just as well because it's just a generic cheap 'farm missions for cash to buy loot crates' Skinner box.   I didn't encounter any massive bugs other than the fact that the photographic quest didn't progress (blindly stabbing the target did work, but frankly that entire mission should have been scrapped given how utterly inadequate controls are - e.g. you cannot stand up while holding the phone, so designing a mission around holding the phone is utterly stupid).  Performance wise, FPS seemed to hover around 50 (with a few drops, including one brief case of FPS dropping 5 for no apparent reason in the prison area) in a R390, i7-6700k, 16GB VM i.e. it runs a lot worse than better looking games like Fallout 4.

225	0	a	Kickstarter backer. Watched the game get passed to a different team. Since then we've seen very few updates (even less meaningful).  It's somewhat sickening that this game no longer has an Early Access tag... it clearly fits the criteria.   There is one map. It's somewhat large, but one map is one map. Mobs are bare-bones. Barely have textures. They all look the same once you start playing.  The two classes only control differently under the hood. Skills and such. Movement and combat are completely the same regardless of what you choose.   There's a lot of cosmetics, but the vast majority are simply retextures of say ten or so different models.  There are different modes, but they all just seem like placeholder junk. Kill X amount of mobs. Kill the boss. Explore the school. They're all pretty boring, and mindless.   The game feels unfinished because it IS unfinished. The original developers talked about this fantastic experience that 'all kids dreamed of'. What we've got here is a dry, hallowed out version of that. There seems to be a resident developer roaming the forums, but updates are very few and far between. I have doubts that he/she is actually part of the dev team, and may just be assigned as such because of his ties to the game.   It's a shame that I can't really think of any other game for you to get if this kind of thing appeals to you, but I really can't recommend this unfinished beta product to anybody. Especially not at the pricetag listed.

3111	1	a	+ Tons of exploration, I loved exploring each and every little corner of this world. Don't let the first two chapters fool you, those are just to ease you into it. After that you'll experience a great deal of freedom while traversing the map.  + Beautiful atmospherical graphics. Just look at those screenshots.  + Nice music as well. No wait, the music is awesome, and so is the sound design.  + Very simple but fun, tight mechanics.   ~ Don't expect any kind of deep emotional storyline. It's cute and funny at times and there is some (actually quite some) intruiging lore to try to make sense of, but the way it's conveyed didn't work quite enough for me, personally. I would have loved a bit more of immersive style of writing, the wit of the dialogues pull me out of it too much. Or rather they fail to draw me in.  - Unfortunately the fixed resolution is kinda low, especially on a 27' monitor. I have played this before on the PS Vita (one of my favorite games on that platform) and there it looks pretty clean and sharp. Not as much now, although it's still pretty enough to get fully immersed in. So arguably the PC is not the best way to play this game, maybe. Maybe.   Having said that I would nevertheless heartily recommend this game for anyone fond of 2D platforming world exploration kind of games. It's very satisfting discovering new areas while jumping around like the most agile spelunker in history. Get this game, especially when it's on sale.!

1107	1	a	It's a tough call to recommend Lucius. The premis behind the game is solid. You play as the anti-christ being trained by you real father aka Satan to hone your powers on your birth parents and their staff by killing them all one at a time without being caught. The execution however is rocky at best. Stiff animations and an overwhelming lack of instruction leaves the experience more frusterating than it needed to be. One more than one occasion I started a chapter not knowing who my target was so I wandered the huge property of the mansion, checking every room I could think of for nearly 45 minutes before I finally caved and checked online. That's a bad sign for game design. This is an indie title and if it wasn't released during the Halloween season there's no way the producers would be able to justify the $30 price tag. My bet, this title is going to see a price drop and if you're curious about it, wait for it to a $5 sale and pick it up, otherwise, you're not missing a lot here.
1463	0	a	This game played me like a used car saleman, and by the time I blew through the story, I couldn't help but talk â¥â¥â¥â¥ on it every time I thought about it. The only saving grace to this game was the multiplayer (or so I thought) because of the character customization, but you're lucky to find a single person playing the game besides you on any difficulty level. Steam wouldn't let me refund the game, and I feel bad because my brother bought it for me, thinking it would occupy our time until something good came out. Don't buy this game, just don't. There are a million and one other shooters out there that do it better. There's nothing new offered here. Save your money.

2457	1	a	The depth and its double-standards of justice kept me going back for more as I pushed further into its curious story to find out who was behind a simple act of malice. I had no idea how 'OK' I was about torturing someone into accepting the conjectured blame the order had cooked up. Even if there wasn't anything left to confess, I wanted to see them scream in pain. If you enjoy stories in your games more than you do gameplay; you should give this game a shot. If you enjoy stories that start of as a bundle of petty missions that eventually turn into more than reality could handle, then give this game 100 hours of your time. And if you happen to be one of those who watched The Borgias with Jeremy Irons, then you should play this game to experience what it's like to be a self-righteousness Inquisitor.
1509	1	a	Once again, people are disrespecting a perfectly good game, for no good reason.   If you like the Farcry style of FPS games, you will like Homefront: The Revolution just fine.  In fact, I found it easier to immerse myself into because it is grittier, more 'realistic' in terms of weapons, environment, styles and AI.   The phone and menu navigation is a little unwieldy, but that just adds to the realism of trying to juggle a rifle and a phone.  I've not had an experience like this since FarCry 2 and I am really enjoying it.  This has been on my list since it came out, but I hesitated, wanting to give time for bugs to be worked out. But I meant to get it before now.  So when Steam offered a free weekend of play, I couldn't pass. I bought it after only a few hours of play.  Deep Silver has made some of my all time favorite games and they always get preferential treatment so I will make a gift of this game to a couple of friends to show my support.
3108	1	a	Huge map open to eplore whereever you please(after getting to the 3rd chapter). So much hidden levels and collectables all over the map and even menu that you wil frequent a guide to see it all. And of course simpel but challenging plattforming, great background OST and fairly charming characters. A 'metroidvania' without upgrades or fights but way more fun exploring and good world building.

The negative side that I see is the enemy is sometime not very smart &amp; the story is rather dull. Other than that I really like this game, the game is like Far Cry 3/4 but in town.

2531	0	a	Please don't get this game. I don't care how cheap it is. If you're like me, you will be pulled in by the 'old-school' nature, the art, and the story. Sadly, that's all the game has going for it. The story and setting are great, including the art. However, if that's all I wanted then I would read a book or watch a movie. A game is ALSO about gameplay and this game has terrible and infuriating gameplay.   The investigation is the best part of gameplay, but you never have any clues other than just talk to everyone. Plus, sometimes you feel you have enough evidence to convict someone, but the game doesn't. So you have to continue just randomly wandering around and talking to people until you finally hear what you need to hear to be able to accuse the person.   Combat is the WORST. It can't make up it's mind if it wants to do Diablo-style gameplay or Baldur's Gate so it ends up combining the worst of both and ending up worse than almost any game I've played. You will die - A LOT. Not because you're not using a good strategy, but because the game is exremely unbalanced. Combat is terrible, yet there are so many dungeons in the game that you must wade through that it becomes so tedious that I finally just had to stop. There is NOTHING good about combat.  Towards the middle of Act II, I did something that I've rarely done in my 25+ years of gaming - I cheated. Not since using the Game Genie on Battletoads or the infamous Konami code on Contra have I had to do this. Sadly, there are no good cheats so I just gave myself lots of EXP and maxed out attributes and hoped that would be enough for me to just breeze through the tedious dungeons so I could just finish the game. Well, I got as far as Act III and then there were the number of dungeons in Act I and II times 10! I got so close to the end, but I just couldn't do it any longer. I quit - I watched the ending on Youtube and will uninstall it and hope to never look at it again.  Pros:  -Story -Setting -Art -Parts of the investigation gameplay  Cons: -Unclear goals/lack of direction -Combat - which could be overlooked if there wasn't so much that was required -Dungeon design - beautiful, but huge and since combat is terrible, they're just tedious. I got lost in several of them because I just didn't know what to click randomly to open the way. -Did I mention the terrible click, wait, and die combat? -Unbalanced enemies -Combat, Combat, Combat, COMBAT
2833	1	a	Brilliant writing. Excellent atmosphere. Gameplay is far from unbearable, though not perfect.  The story and its execution are what make this game, it's relatively long, but you'll get so hooked you won't even notice.  9/10 - Jerky controls, but amazing story and greatly explorational.

1297	1	a	Simple mindless fun.  Just drive around and mow down zombies.  Car mechanics are well made and fun. Objectives are decent enough. Not much to the game but does it well enough for the price.

910	1	a	The idea of using an environment to kill people is pretty neat. It's reasonable story and decent objective, although some of them might be a bit too vague to figure out and then end up taking forever. But overall is good. The music is pumping and pleasure to my ears, which is one of the best thing about the game.

352	0	a	I love the concept and story. But sadly the painfully linear game play and cut-scenes (seemingly every time I take a few steps) make it utterly impossible to immerse myself.   There is literally only one way to kill each target, and the game makes it perfectly unclear on what you're supposed to do. This ultimately leads you to Google the solution, at which point any amount of enjoyment flies out the window.  Here is my playthrough of the first hour of the game via my Youtube Channel:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwjnW0NjZ6o

Step 2 - Blanch the broccoli in boiling water for 2 minutes, then drain well and set aside.  Step 3 - Finely shred the ginger. Then heat a large frying pan or wok, add the sunflower oil, heat it until sizzling, and fry the ginger till it's crisp.  Step 4 - When it's done, remove with a slotted spoon. Add the chicken and garlic, and stir-fry until just browned. Remove the meat using a slotted spoon and set aside.  Step 5 - Add the red pepper and broccoli and stir-fry for around 2-3 minutes until it's just tender.

1507	0	a	  Homefront was a pretty standard FPS game. It did not invent anything new or did any wonders storywise. But it showed potential that could spawn a good series. It was smooth, short and bereft of bugs. Homefront the Revolution is a sub par shooter which tries to follow in Homefront's steps but fails miserably. It sports an open world which is just a bunch of large areas tagged together. The story is standard run of the mill affair and there is a new and kind of fun gun customization on the run.  It would have been received somewhat better if it launched with far fewer bugs. It is an average game which is hidden behind a plethora of crashing, screen freezes, excessive lag and loads of bugs. On top of that it sports a season pass while trying to imitate other AAA titles.  Please stay clear of Homefront: The Revolution as in its current situation, it's not worth the asking price.

673	1	a	Very entertaining game!  Visuals are very decent: 6.5/10  Music is great: 10/10  Story is all right: 9/10 (if you like horror/mystery genre) Voice acting is good: 7/10 The animations and the cutscenes is where this game falls short: 3/10 (bad lip syncing, awkward hand gesticulations and head bobbing, unpolished facial expressions: all these make this game a parody, not a horror)  Gameplay is solid, I didn't encounter any bugs. This is basically a puzzle game when you're looking for ways to eliminate people by making it seem like an accident. The gameplay is very linear, you have only one way to make it right. I can't rate it, this kind of games is not my usual cup of tea.  Overall I enjoyed the game, but mainly for its story aspect, we had quite a few laughs with my girlfriend while watching the cut-scenes or observing interactions between NPCs.  There is very little replay value though, once you completed the story and know how to solve the puzzles.  My personal score: 6/10. Recomended if on sale under $10.

However, this game never had good looking assets. If that matters to you, then wait a few months to play this because I'm sure someone will make better textures. But this game isn't about the graphics, it never was. I got this for 5 bucks from indiegala, but at $15 or less I'd call this a buy.

2338	0	a	Wow, it's like time traveling to the 90's and playing those old arcadey shooters. Forget physics, sense, ambience. This game would call duke nukem 3d an update. Gliding above surfaces is so reminiscent of old gameplay, and knowing where, what and how to do something is really not necessary for a game where you have to achieve something. Tells ya what, grab them bills, tie 'em to your dog's balls and let him lick the bills to oblivion instead of buying this game.
1883	1	a	  As someone who had gone into this knowing that it was riddled with bugs, I was pleasantly suprised by what I got. While some of the characters felt shallow and underdeveloped, and a few (painful at times) minigames, and amount of guns left me wanting, I still found a game with great gunplay, amazing setting, clearly dedicated developers, fantastic level design, and more things then I can list. The soundtrack admittedly could've been much better and varied, but all things cnsidered, this is a prime example of devs listening to what fans had to say, taking it to heart, and actually using it. I rate it a strong 8 to a weak 9 out of ten.

HOWEVER the general Outline of the story, progression, Weapon customization, level design where all really good and I really enjoyed it. Yes this game has had bad Backing and Reviews so Far but the Way I look at it is the Only True Review that someone can give or the Only True feedback someone can give is YOURSELF. Everyone has their own things that they like as Everyone is Different. So Try out the game because YOU want to.

981	1	a	Rating: 8/10  This game was actually pretty fun (in twisted meaning), with nice graphics and creepy soundtrack. The whole story is situated in one huge manor, and there are many cutscenes before and after 'murder', so besides enjoying great 'puzzle-solving' game-play, you also have a feeling like watching a movie, pretty sick movie about demonic child. Every death is unique and requires time to figure out how to manage it (some are quite tough).

3096	1	a	A great exploration game. The OST is fantastic, the best ambient soundtrack for a game I can think of. The map is huge and waiting to be explored, but not to the point of being impossible or overwhelming. The scenic visuals are beautiful silhouettes with colored backgrounds.  The characters leave a lot to be desired. Their artstyles are very unflattering, and the dialogue in the game feels very low quality. If it wasn't for them, this game would be perfect.  The game combines the Knytt series with Within a Deep Forest, while at the same time changing the upgrade-based gameplay of each. Instead, it begins as linear, having you learn both forms of basic gameplay, then combines them into one for the bulk of the game. The only powerups are area-specific, which is both good and bad.

494	1	a	I love this game :3
2587	1	a	Game itself is effin great and if you like off the wall stuff you'll remember this one. In between the superficially crappy writing, the confusing tone and badly implemented, clunky mechanics awaits a murder mystery that you just have to uncover yourself. I said the writing is superficially crappy: it's a ruse to lower your expectations and surprise you later.  Buy it discounted if you're fine with a DOS-era style port that will require fiddling with drivers, computer reboots and INI editing to bring it up to shine.  Technical addition: If you have issues with an Xbone controller (right analogue stick all messed up), it will require downgrading of your controller driver to an earlier version. See this forum post on how to get it working right:  http://pinnaclegameprofiler.com/forum/showthread.php?31550-Making-Xbox-One-Controller-Work-with-Windows-10-Please-Sticky 
1896	0	a	  Can't figure out what the game is supposed to be...
399	1	a	This is a clever concept that falls fairly short in execution. The game mechanics are simple enough, just find the right combination of objects in the correct steps and watch things unfold. The puzzles start out fairly simple, but then start to get to the point of being illogical. There are also numerous graphical glitches (bike doesn't steer, objects floating slightly above shelves, etc.) and the VO is sub-par. Overall though, the game ends up being mischevious fun and looks decent. I would still recommend it.  6.5/10

366	0	a	This is the plot of the first Omen movie, but then also taking place at a same location as in the second movie, a mansion that is. Even the birthday party is included right at the beginning. So this is simply ''Omen - The game'' (for those who are familiar with it).   Good stuff:  *Assuming it has been well tested or been worked on by great programmers, seeing how I've never experienced a single bug in it myself.   *The atmosphere is probably what holds it up. Like a weak and sole supporting beam. It makes the game enjoyable enough to go on and see what the next death is gonna be like. Built up with the characters in the mansion getting more and more tensed after every accident. But other than that...   Bad stuff experienced (as feedback):  *Graphics are too dark in some areas to make out details.  *Music does not hold enough variety.  *The controls, or specifically in this case, the camera perspective, is working against you when you wish to highlight and interact with objects.  *The Gameplay offers very little to do other than just progressing the story. Apart from being able to acquire three more or less helpful items, after doing minor tasks, there are no side quests at all or alternative paths in the game. This makes it much too linear and thereby cuts it down rather short.  *There is no challenge. The toughest part in the game, is to control the telekinesis with your mouse movement, in order to swing objects at people. That's about it.   Conclusion:  I don't recommend purchasing this for more than 10 Euro/12 Dollar
1888	0	a	  Meh. If I didn't have anything else to play, I'd say it's ok. But fortunately I do have other games. I don't really feel the atmosphere of occupation/resistance fighting, I'm not immersed, I don't like the design of the open world. Gunplay is not the best, stealth sucks and overall gameplay feels rather clunky and unpolished. Missions aren't overly creative nor fun. The characters aren't particularly engaging and the MC is completely mute, which sucks outside of Half-Life games. Oh, and it's sorta buggy, settings don't save at all (getting correct resolution, texture quality and so on took me good half an hour or more, and involved using some workarounds). Well, at least the visuals are nice, though I find everything about design tired, the uniforms, the vehicles, the drones, the metal outposts.  It's not an entirely bad game, just not a very good one either. Doesn't feel like an AAA title which it strives to be.
512	1	a	I really enjoyed this game. A lot of people say the voice acting isn't good. The great music makes up for it IMO. I however think the cutscenes are very weak and annoying at times (specifically the last chapter STAHP). That is really my only complaint.   This game is Satanic af. 2 dollars for 8 hours of entertainment!

2912	1	a	This game is a masterpiece. Honestly, in my book it wins best game of all time. The plot is just really awesome with twists and turns everywhere. The main character is hilarious. FK..in the coffee. I lost my â¥â¥â¥â¥. If you want a really good storytelling single player experince, this game does the best job on it. However, it dwindles in the graphics aspect as the characters' audio isn't usually in sync with the character's lip when they are talking. But that's only a small minor problem. 
2515	1	a	If wordy detail doesn't put you off, or perhaps even entices you then you've come to the right place.  Amazing value and depth for the modest price tag, clearly a labour of love.  Sometimes frustrating trying to work out what to do next, but not so bad that one would abandon all hope of being able to finish it (plus there's always Google!).  I'm 16 hours in and enjoying it, though it's fairly deep it isn't difficult to play once you get an hour or two into it.  Recommended for old school players and those wanting more Dante than Dungeons &amp; Dragons.
2925	1	a	You won't find a game quite like this anywhere else. I trudged through glitches, crashes, slow gameplay, more crashes, and more crashes, I came against many game-breaking issues that I barely scraped by, and one game-stopping conundrum at the very end. It was absolutely miserable...and I feel it was totally worth it.  Watch out if you don't have patience, spare time, or sense of humor or open-mindedness, The gameplay is slow, clunky, and often boring, but I was never bored. I was always excitedly wondering when the next part of the story was going to unfold. I'd perhaps groan when I knew a long filler part was starting, but going through it all I'd be thinking was 'I can't wait to see what happens in the next cutscene.' The characters and story are a grand slam, though it gets quite weird.  The soundtrack is stilted but majestically strange, and a perfect fit for the game.  Now, this game is often a rollercoaster ride between genius and complete cheeseball, but both ends of the spectrum are equally enjoyable. I love cheese, but I also felt legitimately touched during parts of this game. This is the type of game I never want to forget about, and probably won't.  Read non-spoiler reviews such as this one, and go with your gut. You'll probably know by then if this game is for you or not.

1469	0	a	If I could have refunded this game I would have. Its a terrible PC port. The biggest issues the game has is the control scheme, you cannot key bind other than default controls , as the default scheme remains active regardless what configuration you selected. I eventually just gave up and tried to use my wired 360 controller, that even had issues, with the UI prompts constantly flickering and not displaying properly when needed. I had to settle on using auto hot key, in which this is the 2nd pc port I've had to resort to this now.   Aside from it being a bad PC port. Its just not a very good shooter campaign. Don't let it fool you, this is just a run of the mill first person shooter campaign. It is hardly an open world game. There are no branching paths and nothing you do in the open world matters in the plot. I recently played through Killzone Shadowfall a launch game for the ps4 and it was infinitely better than this. I had way more fun with that, and its graphics were more impressive and it wasn't using cryengine running on ultra. Especially near the end of this game, the art assets looked very flat and very low res/ low poly for what is supposed to be the big finisher moment of the game.  The highlights of this game where when the engine shines, showing moody atmospheric lighting with contrasting lights. Also, If you are going to play this game, play it on the normal difficulty. Its not a well balanced shooter, even with all the upgrades, you will find yourself dying in under 2 seconds sometimes.

1747	0	a	I had high hopes for Homefront: The Revolution. However; between disapointing AI, poor optimization, and limited coop I can't recomend this game. If you already have it, I suggest seeking a refund: because even if you can run this game well on your PC the single player campaign with its borderline braindead AI and pathfinding in its current state is simply not worth the full price. If you must have this game, get it when it goes on sale.

2469	1	a	Ok while I do recommend it I do so only for specific types of gamers. If you are OLD SCHOOL this is for you; If you love an intensive reading assignment, lots of things to sift through and the likelyhood you are going to die a lot and the save now save often rule comes to mind, then this is for you. If you are used to ressurecting and trying again, multiple chances, and lots of help guides, then look elsewhere. Enjoy :)
258	0	a	First off, I really wanted to like this game. The setting, the story-telling, the opening cinematic -- everything about its thematic texture is just so sadistically appealing.  Unfortunately, the product that the trailers, the game descriptions and even other reviews prepared me for was not the product I got. I expected a demonic sandbox chock full of whimsically creative murder. Instead, I got a mediocre Hitman clone with exactly one (absurdly specific) solution for each murder.  The game teases you with all of these awesome powers straight out of The Omen: telekinesis, mind control, pyromancy. But you can really only use them when the game feels like it.  I would be fine with the restrictions on your mayhem if the game provided some semblance of direction. Instead, you're left to aimlessly wander the game's massive mansion, searching for the tiny, sometimes pixel-perfect item you need to proceed.  The best example of my frustration was a mission where you had to off your family's beloved butler.   (SPOILERS OH GOD OH GOD SPOILERS PEOPLE SPOILERS) (SPOILERS OH GOD OH GOD SPOILERS PEOPLE SPOILERS) (SPOILERS OH GOD OH GOD SPOILERS PEOPLE SPOILERS)  The in-game prompt informs you that it's winter, and it would be a terrible shame if the ancient old goof slipped and fell.   Alright, fair enough -- I probably have to create some ice, huh, Lucius? Let me just grab one of the dozens of interactive cups dotting the mansion, and we'll be off.   Wait, what's that? I can't use any of the cups on the sink? Well, then... how am I supposed to get water, bro? Oh, you mean I need a water bottle, because that's 'less suspicious?' Okay, fine... Are you gonna maybe give me a hint about which of the mansion's 20+ rooms would be a good place to start? No? Great...  So, the kitchen then? Nope! The servants' quarters? As if! My bedroom, you say? Oh, you've gotta be â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ me, Lucius. It's in my bedroom? The very start of the level, which you purposely led me away from via the in-game objective marker? The furthest possible point from where you gave me my mission objective? Fine, Lucius. Fine. I'll go get the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing water bottle.  Now I've probably got to just dump it on the ground by the doorway the butler's sure to walk through while attending to the Christmas lights, right? Oh, that's not right? Of course it isn't, Lucius. Of course it isn't. Instead, I've got to find the one incredibly tiny spot in the middle of the courtyard (the mansion's biggest room) where you want me to put it, don't I? Whatever, Lucius. I don't care enough anymore.  Oh, now the butler's taking his sweet time coming outside, huh? Not like he's supposed to be attending to the family during Christmas dinner or anything. Can I just wait for him to have a stroke, Lucius? No, that would be too easy. I'm guessing from your minimal exposition that I'm supposed to tamper with the Christmas lights to get his attention, huh? Fine, let's get to tampering.  Naturally, I assume you won't let me use my telekinesis to pull down the lights. That would be too easy. And also fun. Too much fun for your liking, Lucius. So, what then? Do I need to find some misplaced tool in the farthest wing, only to backtrack to the fuse-box in the next room and fry the circuit breaker? That seems like something you would do, Lucius.   Don't argue with me -- it absolutely does sound like you, Lucius. Okay, fine then -- what do I have to do, buddy?  Ahh.... I have to turn off the Christmas Lights via a barely visible light-switch? In fairness, that's also just so you Lucius. So completely you.   There. I turned off the light-switch and now the butler's coming out. Oh, good! He slipped and fell! But, wait... he's still alive! So, I've got to finish him off... Oh, now you let me use my telekinesis, Lucius? Finally, when it's too late to matter?  You truly are a generous god, Lucius...

8	1	a	Short version: If you have ANY desire to play a MOBA that was ahead of its time. Get this.   Long-ish textwally version: This game was the BEST way back in the day when there was a somewhat lively community, it's died down quite a lot since, but still decent. The gameplay was, and to me, still is, slightly is ahead of the MOBA curve in it's own way, such as being able to upgrade your main citadel to buff your creep waves and the like. Now due to it's age, theres many a bug, my personal favorite being random times where your character won't bloody move when told, but that's pretty minor and rare.  Another thing I love is the fact that, while certain God's are more suited to certain roles, there is no 'Best' build for every situation for a given character. Speaking of God's, quite a bit of diversity, you've got anywhere from the fragile archer angel, Regulus, to the literal walking castle Rook. The gods are split into two types: Assassins and General's, Assassins just worry about themselves, whereas General are capable of summoning various creatures, either through abilities or items. While there are admittedly only 10 gods, and all there ever will be as far as we can tell, well, outside of mods of course, but they all have a huge amount of thought and love put into their designs and back story.  There are about 8 maps, and 4 modes, so it may repeat a bit... In hindsight I realize this was just me gushing over the game, but still, if that doesn't make you interested, dunno what will, 9.5/10

3002	1	a	Buying this game is a catch-22. If you buy it, SWERY is able to eat and make more awesome games, but you're also supporting the malpractice of horribly broken PC ports. If you don't buy it (or don't play it), the devs won't want to port to PC in the first place.  Then again, a few sales earned or lost 3 years after the original release isn't going to have much effect on the developers.  Mods can fix it, but they don't prevent the crashes that set you back 30 minutes

2547	1	a	Compared to other posters, I haven't gotten that far. But in the little bit of time I've played I've arrested heretics, tortured them, and condemned them to death. Granted this could've possibly messed up the game, but oh well, I'm a cleric on a mission for the Mother Church, and they confessed after many hours of torture.  Be prepared for a difficult campaign. This game is intense, and is very HARD....especially compared to those triple-A titles passing for RPGs today. Those games are a cakewalk. This...this is a nightmare. :shudders:  There is a lot of reading involved, so if you don't like to read, sorry. Also, if you don't read everything you come across, you'll find that you missed important information and now you're stumbling along blind without a clue as to what to do next. (I did this...and the quest objectives are of no help at all)....  Also, if you don't grind just right, and level your skills just right...well, apparently the Mother Church was wrong in sending you out. You obviously â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off God somewhere...because you'll be dead in a ditch somewhere, and the people won't even have the common courtesy to come along and give you a decent burial. How about that for a bunch of heretics??  10/10 would find everyone a heretic.

1448	1	a	this game deffinately had a troubled lauch. devs are still sticking by it. this wasn't a cash grab. this was an honest effort to do the best they could and it's above average. it's above good. it's not great, but it's not even near mediocre/horrible. Game ran terribly when it launched for me. this has been fixed, runs smooth on an i7 and 970. no frame dips or anything. actual gameplay is fun, maybe a bit repetitive at times, but if you fancy the collector's mindset of the later far cry games, this will be fun for a while. not all tactics work on everything (shooting tanks won't do much, and not recruiting help from the other resistance fighters will mean you will die a lot) AI is horrible. most of the time they pose zero challenge, but once in a blue moon they seem â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t difficulty at a few moments. (forgot that one, thanks!) stealth isn't really doable in redzones, but thats to be expected. I would have prefered the game stay in a yellow zone during the start before switching over to a redzone after the tutorial is done, and also the motorbikes aren't a good vehicle choice for these environments, but the game is solid, fun, and now really polished. I'd reccomend it on sale if you liked far cry type games and are willing to look past the issues.    high 6/10 in my book.

1720	1	a	I don't understand why this game has such a bad rap. Sure, the intro is 30 minutes long and unskippable, but the game plays like an urban Far Cry title with weapon and character / gear customization, vehicles, stealth, lock picking and 'hacking'. The gunplay is decent, nothing special but it's fun enough on it's own. The ability to drastically modify your weapon mid-firefight is pretty cool. I haven't paid any attention to the story, so I can't really rate that, but all in all, the game is at least fun. I understand it had a terrible launch, and it was a sequel no one really wanted, but if it wasn't called 'Homefront' I think this game would have done a lot better. Not worth $60, but $30? Maybe. $20, definitely.

2115	0	a	It's the launch of Aliens: Colonial Marines alllllllllll over again.  I haven't preordered a video game in over a year, and Homefront: The Revolution was the one to break the ice. That being said, the water beneath it was highly acidic, and here's why.  The lag is real. The game engine itself is my biggest complaint, since I can't even really play the game due to it. There's lag, and tons of gigantic black splotches on the screen that decide to obscure my line of fire at just the wrong moments, so that in tandem with lag and shaking around forces me to wildfire towards the Koreans, and absolutely forces me to avoid stealth gameplay, which ironically is the whole focus of this. It probably doesn't help that you move like Buzz Lightyear, blasting off all over the place when that isn't your intent.  The graphics in Alien: Isolation are far better than this, and A:I came out about 2 years ago; Isolation runs smoother than snow on a mountain in a Bob Ross painting, and it has phenomonally good graphics, and IT is (sort of) an open world experience, so there's absolutely no excuse for there to be such abominable lag.

1870	1	a	Quick Review:  Pros -Plays a bit like Farcry 3-4( if you like those games) -A nice weapon customization  -Good Graphics -okay to decent gun fights -A.I actually hunts you down for once in a game and not for 20 seconds or so -The best easter egg you will ever see and use  Cons -First part of the game has bad fps i hit around 35-45fps on high settings. but then after a bit goes to the 60fps -not fully open world like Farcry and other open world games. but still big maps -A.I which you have asked can block the way this has happened about 3-4 times atm ( only way to solve issues is to kill them or wait a bit and push out of the location works every time for me) -CANT DESTROY THEM SHIPS WITH ANYTHING -no multiplayer or other game modes( i know it has co-op for set missions but a survival or co-op for campaign would be good) -Story should be better -bug in the 2x supersample ( change to 1x and runs fine)   5-6/10 not worth the cash amount now wait abit if you wanna get or get it, its up to you.      Balanced review Well, We are all quick to point the finger. But this games development was not a simple A to B as it were. The game went all over the shop, loss of funding and time wasted. Am sure if it went from A to B then this game would actually be alot better.  Gameplay is similar to far 3 and 4, + crysis games. But you take alot more damage. You will die alot till you get used to the game. A.I is actually difficult in some spots and in certain zones always think twice.(AI can hunt you down which is nice for once) The cry engine again shows good graphics. Weapon customization on the go is good and crafting (If only you could craft a dam health kit)  The first part the performance is not great even with the settings on high i was getting 35-45fps. after 2mins after that i get 58-60s+ on high settings. There is some windows that you have trouble entering which is annoying. But you get that with mosts games.   I am playing on medium difficulty at the moment and still the A.I fights of friendly and enemies are for the most part ok. Some areas are bad they do little damage to each other, other times the A.I are just insane. e.g A friendly A.I takes out a patrol and a car then some reason follows you around( i Didn't ask it to) Darn that A.I survived a long time and i died less times because of it.  Maps are big but fails to deliver the full open world exp of a much larger map then sections. The bike can be annoying at times. but just get use to it No change to the gameplay as it progresses or change to the phone thingy task  I encounted not many problems throughout playing this game, ok theres certain places are better then others. but no harmfull bug's stopping gameplay or missions. just my poor skills at being stealth. Changing keys works fine for me no problems and i swopped wasd for tfgh to try it out for a bit.  last this thing, one of the best easter eggs i have ever come across.and works fine.
2579	1	a	This is the hardest review I've ever had to write.  Having played through maybe half the game, I have to admit that I absolutely LOVE it. It does so many things right and the way it continues to surprise me at every turn is something I've never experienced before.  However, like when your awesome, kind, with-a-heart-of-gold-sweet-and-nice, but drunken uncle - who's usually the very best to hang out with, has the best stories, and showers you with genuine life wisdom at every opportunity - one day feeds your face a blank stare while he feels you up, it hurts like a m0therÂ£ucker.  It feels so disgusting and wrong that you feel your bones ache, no matter his 'good' intentions. And you know without a doubt, and with an indescribable sadness, that if it hadn't been for that specific unmentionable perk of his, he would have been THE greatest person ever, in all of history.  If Deadly Premonition would have gotten a decent PC-port IT would have been the greatest game ever. Instead, like your uncle's dark, ugly advances at you, it makes you suffer CTDs every hour or so, if you want to continue reaping the amazing benefits you get by playing.  And God help me, there's a REASON why I can't put it away despite that suffering; there's a reason I'm prostituting myself by still playing it. And I can't fathom or even remember any other title I would have done this for, thus my having to save at the towns phone booths every chance I get.  Because: Just like your drunk uncle - who feels you up every now and then, which feels so god damn wrong and unpleasant - the same guy has also recently provided the cure for every known sickness on earth, has the solution for world peace at hand, and is in the process of providing every common man with space travel to the new planets (yes, plural) he's discovered.  Just like that, it is a fact that the pesky, murky river of epic coding failure in Deadly Premonition also contains, not gold nuggets, but straight up gold BARS, of proportions previously unheard of.  And if you had that knowledge, could you, or not, look beyond your uncle Deadly Premonition's one recurring fault? Could you grind your teeth and hold on, just until the unpleasantness went away, just a couple of minutes with restarts every now and then, so he could deliver - to you and the world, yet another great moment? A moment you're not even sure what would entail this time around, but you knew it would blow you and the rest of the world away, and contribute to the ascension of man, soon rivaling the almighty himself?  I'll let you think about that for a minute while I leave you with this: This game has some of the best parts of Twin Peaks in it, combined with certain awesome moments taken straight out of the Seven movie, and lots and lots of the greatest kind of quirkiness - which always feels entertaining and amusing rather than annoying.  Even with the horribly easy and janky combat present; if they would only have done a decent port of this game, I would have given it top credit, just because of the big balls they had to make something so extraordinary.  In the land of generic FPSs, a dime a dozen Early Access $h1t3, and copied to boredom 4x games, Deadly Premonition is the undisputed king, emperor, and penultimate ruler when it comes to creativity and fun storytelling. As of now, it is unfortunately a title you will have to suffer quite a bit of CTDs to play through, but to me that suffering have paid off in abundance.  I am really not sure I can put it away, and I'm considering just taking small breaks every CTD and just naturally continue playing from my latest save point. There is no other great title, big bag of money, or warm and tight hole that would have me spinning 'round its little finger like this.  I'm ashamed to admit it, but I'm probably letting uncle Deadly Premonition get away with it. Maybe you should too.

632	1	a	Enjoyed this game a lot, as it reminded me of a film series called 'The Omen' which I particularly enjoyed. This game's practically a movie tie-in! Loved gaining the powers and using them to brutally or carefully murder all of the house's occupants. However, I did have to look up the next step in certain chapters using a guide, as the notebook tips can sometimes be incredibly vague, or not show up at all. This game is not without its glitches. Still, I enjoyed it and would recommend it.

2847	1	a	Deadly Premonition is one of the strangest games I have played. It has terrible graphics, a story largely ripped straight from Twin Peaks, combat that is so easy it feels tacked on, bad driving controls, and terrible sound design among other things. In the end though I enjoyed it enough to finish the game with all the side missions completed and I even got the 65th trading card. It isn't by any means a good game, but something about it just makes it fun. This is very much a video game equivalent of a cult film. Anyone who enjoys the sound of that should give the game a try.
526	0	a	Really wanated to enjoy this game, been eying it for a while. Boy, was I let down, probably just my expectations but this game is very linear, has basic point and click puzzles, nothing special/interesting to do and seems very short. Great concept, needs more to it. Was worth it at 99c but I purchased the bundle at $10. Second game looks like it fixed some of these issues but appears to have far too many issues to stop me from getting a refund on the whole thing. Probably would've considered a $5 on just this one, but I can't.

519	0	a	  'YOUR DAD IS VERY UPSET ABOUT YOU, LUCIUS'    I still remember in the early 2012 when I saw first pictures of the game and then trailer, I was like oh damn, we gonna make some rampage with this little evil son of devil right? But then again, let's be honest.   You was able to do more rampage in GOAT SIMULATOR than in this game.   Anyway, I was still pretty excited about it and I still was in first levels of the game but that has changed when you realized that there is one certain way how to perform the kill and you need to find it. Well, yes I do understand that most of them needs to be done like that, to prevent being suspicious but if Shiver Games put in the work, and make various ways like that, that'd be brilliant. But level-design was not bad, I'm just saying if there was more to do that would be very good. Also I saw somebody said that we should get 'beautiful Lucius but instead we got some fat plumpkin because evil goes within beauty' I do agree with that. Soundtrack is average, no tracks you will truly remember.   Whole story was pretty stupid, and it was not even progressing like I wish it would. Those 18 episodes were pretty down except few ones e.g. the one behind wine cellar. The powers that Lucius possess was really nice and various and that is good point. Steam Achievements was pretty easy but devs crossed line with some of those, when they tell you to be on 7 hours long game for over 40 hours. Currently it is changed so it tracks you time by Steam Library, but back in the days the tracker worked only when you was inside game, no menu, no alt+tab, no Steam Overlay and that was pretty pathetic.   Big and I mean trully mega big point goes to  Dante Manor  because that place is exceptional, truly beautiful and awesome. One of the best gaming spots I have ever been in. I did not even mind to walk around that big place from point A to B because it was joy.   I really want to put up THUMBS DOWN, but then again I start to think that it was not that bad journey and I will still give it UP. Lets see what second Lucius can do.    EDIT: 7 HOURS LATER - NA NA NA. Screw this game. I am changing thumbs to DOWN and rating from 6 to 4.    Bonus Point: Dante Manor   Rating: 4/10

1635	1	a	NOTE: I am a singleplayer gamer, so I'll only be reviewing the singleplayer portion(s) of this game.  TL;DR - Great game, and I do recommend it for others. But since you can't play past the ending, it's not a game I'm going to play more than once. Thanks for the free weekend so that I didn't end up regretting a purchase.  Now that that's out of the way...  Played through story mode from beginning to end. Story itself had potential to be really great through-and-through, but certain climactic moments were full of cliche and uniformity (especially the end bit). While I was quite disappointed that it didn't follow the original concepts of the original Homefront (esp. because John Milius was a consultant for the original Homefront story) it ended up being capable of standing on its own feet, as it were. I did rather appreciate the constant fear of betrayal, and even being on the receiving end of suspected betrayal, but I didn't like how the KPA took over the US via waging economic war. I much preferred the original story, and this one would have been great as a game of its own, without sharing the spirit of another.  With all that said however, it broke my biggest rule in 'open world' gaming; in Homefront: The Revolution, you can't play past the ending. That, in itself, is normally a dealbreaker for me. There have been a few exceptions to this (especially Fallout: New Vegas since you can just 'fix' that with a mod). But unfortunately, this game is not the exception, but the rule. Sure, it has other 'modes' you can play in singleplayer, but if I can't get the story out of the way so that I can freely muck about in the worldspace(s) without that main mission marker making me avoid certain areas and/or safehouses, then I simply won't play it again. This is functionally a quasi-clone of the latest Far Cry games, and both FC3 and FC4 let you play past the story. And before anyone suggests it; NO, reloading the checkpoint from before accepting the 'Point of No Return' mission is NOT acceptable.  Now, if they ever release a 'free roam' DLC where the story bit is removed from the entire worldspace whereby all the yellow and red zones are unlocked, and you can continually do random jobs, I might consider purchasing the Freedom Fighter Bundle when it's on sale again. But until that happens, no sale. By the way, yes, I am indeed suggesting I'd buy it as a DLC.  Aside from that... Even though they released the 'performance patch,' I still got quite a bit of lag playing through the story. My rig only just barely exceeds the recommended requirements, but even still, I don't think they're quite done with their optimisations. Either that, or they may want to up their recommended requirements to match what is actually required to not have the game completely freeze for a few seconds upon entering a new zone.  At the end of the day, I do like the game. I just don't like it enough to support devs who make open-world games yet keep the ending closed. So while I greatly appreciate the free weekend that allowed me to make a well-informed purchase decision, I won't be buying it until that huge mistake is corrected.  I already know a lot of people don't care about the whole 'open world; closed ending' thing, and [sarcasm]good for you[/sarcasm] if that's the case. But shut up, this ain't your review, nor your wallet.

185	1	a	That game can make the time you spend playing it fun and pretty interesting. The game has a fine graphic and cool gameplay, the soundtrack is good. This was a unique experience playing that game and I liked it a lot.
821	1	a	Lucius!Idon't think that is a Horror game at all,because is not scary;I think is a half adventure and half puzzle game,in fact you have to find ways to kill every member of your family with various infernal powers and objects,that sometimes are easy to find,sometimes not.  This game reminds the 'Omen' movies that are a must to watch if you like horror movies with satanic characters.  I played 10.5 hours to end the story with a bit of exploration and to complete all the second quests and,finally,I think that Lucius is a very good game to play,but not spend 20â¬(yes,I'm Italian :D ) to buy this game!Wait for some sales,like I did!  Thanks for the attention!Bye ;)
2329	1	a	I don't often write reviews but I feel the need with this game. I also don't often pre-order games but I was super stoked for Homefront: The Revolution. It didn't dissapoint. I am in love with this game and as someone who rarely finds playing games multiple times is worth while this game I promise you I will beat repeatedly. I already beat it once. Took me 29 hours to do on hardened/normal. There is repeatability there. I rushed through the first time to get the story but the second time I will take the time to explore everything, find everything, and do all of the side missions. The game is challenging at times and easy at times. Sometimes you feel out of control and sometimes you feel completely in control. It has a beautiful balance between open world and story. The plot twists are well done. I do have to say one of my favorite parts though is the fact that you can see the effect you are having on the population. Your actions change the demeaner of the citizens in step by step progressions as you do more to encourage them. The Red Zones are run and gun where as the yellow zones are are more Assassins Creedish with a soldierly spin. Lets just say this game grabbed me, sucked me in, and I thought about it constantly when I wasn't playing. Honestly in my opinion anybody complaining about this game should have known not to buy it before it came out. They produced the game they promised and if you pre-order a game you should expect bugs. I had less then I expected. Although I will say at the moment I have not played multiplayer for I am unable to. I keep getting an error code.
841	1	a	So very interesting but buggy. You play as the Antichrist, a kid who murders everyone. It is dark and gruesome but the graphics are not amazing so the gross parts are not too bad. It's buggy as well and hard. I could not beat it without watching play throughs. All that being said it's still a super cool game pick it up at 50% off.

You turn your vision even slightly and the whole world becomes a blur. I can not, and will not recommend this game. It is not passable for a title developed by a studio in 2016. It's incomplete and should not have been released yet. Â£39.99 gone to waste.
448	1	a	I loved the original Omen movie. But as much as it tries, it gets nowhere close to the heartbeat of the original flick and the gameplay is frustrating rather than fun. This would have been better implemented as a Telltale story than this horrible point and click borefest.  Cons. -Terrible voice acting. -Too much wandering around trying to find stuff. -Too much wandering around trying to find stuff. -Too much wandering around trying to find stuff. -Demon powers are not actually any fun to use.  -No Controller support.

2591	1	a	Whatâs that, Zach â youâre at your witâs end?  Honestly, I donât know where to start. DEADLY PREMONITION is one of the most memorable games I have ever played, but sadly not always for the right reasons. There is so much wrong with this game itâs not possible to list all its flaws in a brief review like this. Suffice it to say, it runs terribly on the PC with the longest load times I have ever encountered and more glitches than I could shake a stick at. The graphics are pretty awful (I used the DP patch which supposedly improves performance and graphics but it still looks like something from the early 90s). The controls are awful and if I hadnât discovered a tweak that fixes a ridiculous aiming problem I would probably have given up on the game. The combat is hideous too, with the aforementioned dreadful aiming system and poor mechanics. Even the UI is an irritating mess. And yet despite all this Iâm glad I stuck it out until the end (incidentally, despite having completed the game I only found a handful of the many side quests, as they are often time-sensitive and way off the main story track). So whatâs good about DP? Well it certainly is quirky, and itâs easy to see why itâs gained such a devoted cult following. At its core DP has a very strong story backed up by solid voice acting. It has many weird and interesting characters and some crazy dialogue. Although it is derivative (Twin Peaks and Silent Hill are often-used comparators, and rightly so) it still has a unique personality. Thereâs no doubt that if DP had been produced to the same standard as a AAA game it would be outstanding. But unfortunately I can only recommend it if you have a slight masochistic streak, as, it appears, do I. Thereâs a five-star game in here struggling to get out but due to all its faults I can only give it 3.5/5.

2937	1	a	It's â¥â¥â¥â¥ing horrible.
642	0	a	An extremely novel game in overall concept. Unfortunately, while the concept feels like it should be akin to an open-ended level from one of the Hitman games, the result is more like a series of finnicky, overly precise puzzles that rule out perfectly valid solutions in favor of one inexplicably correct path. The end result is just some of the worse sins of adventure game logic applied to murdering people with satanic powers - which makes that great idea a lot less fun than it should be.
1393	1	a	This game was fun. I finished the story mod in 8 hours, so it could be longer. But there are other mods to try.  Missions are very similar, drive to escort someone or kill something. But the cool HD graphic and the satisfying feeling when you drive through the big horde is awesome!

2814	1	a	It's hard to talk about Deadly Premonition without sounding like everything you're saying is at best half-serious. I'll try anyway:  Deadly Premonition is one of the best games from the past five years or so I've played. It certainly doesn't show from the clunky controls or often-bizarre graphics, but somewhere around the midpoint of the game I realized that it manages to push past 'so-bad-it's-good' into territory of being actual, just-regular-type good.  Deadly Premonition uses the medium to tell a story surprisingly well, and even though it's obviously not for everyone (You will almost certainly love or hate this game), it's legitimately better than you might first expect.

1656	1	a	I hated the first Homefront more than any words can say. That game single handedly stopped me from ever pre-order games again and I have stuck to that rule since. It was complete garbage. I got Revolution for free from a friend who didnât want it. I REFUSED to pay money for this after being burned from the first game but I can say that this is definitely a step in the right direction. It does have that low budget buggyness to It but the core gameplay is actually pretty fun. The level design was good (open areas now) in fact a few areas of the game are really good. Gunplay/sound was all good, only had one crash and the sound cut out on me once but a checkpoint reload fixed it. Input remapping was there but wonky, on screen prompts didnât match rebinds and some actions you flat out could not change. This game did not need a silent protagonist, he really needed to be voiced over and his lack of interaction with other characters really took me out of the immersion. The free running/climbing system was a welcome feature as with all FPS now especially after the Dying Light handled it. Stealth mechanics could have used some more work. You could go stealth but it was not a fluid and fun as Deus Ex. They definitely need to expand on the rpg elements with gear/weapons upgrade. I got 16+ hours out of this game and I never thought I would say this about Homefront but give it a shot if your curious. Itâs worth a play through.
2840	1	a	A rich, story driven action-horror game with decent, pseudo-RE4 controls and great commidic relief, Deadly Premonition is a MUST HAVE for ALL gamers.  10/10 would buy again.
4392	1	a	 Early Access Review
2657	1	a	So, let's get this straight: this is a TERRIBLE game. But I love it so much. Now to explain why I feel this way.  Deadly Premonition follows the story of a quirky FBI detective, Francis York Morgan (just call him York), as he and his imaginary friend Zach solve the mystery behind the murder of a young women, Anna Graham, in the fictional town of Greenvale, Washington. It's a classic 'who dun it', story, which slowly melts more and more into the bizzare, and stange as you get further along into the game. It should be said, that this game clearly takes HEAVY inspiration from the 90s TV series Twin Peaks, which follows a similar story of a detective unravelling the murder of a young women, which also slowly gets more and more surreal as the series gets further along in it's story.   The gameplay, and graphics are by far where most concerns arise regarding the game, with shoddy aiming, terrible driving while you drive around the town doing either the main quest, or the various other sidequests,  bad textures, some character models look like ones you'd see in PS2 games, bad framerate, etc. Some gameplay decisions made in this game can be extremely baffling in how poorly designed they are. These are by far the games weakest aspect, and are honestly sometimes a hassle to play through. But, however I believe the game makes up for what it lacks in its characters, and overall quirkiness.   I cannot tell you how many times I smiled, or gave a chuckle to the characters interacting with each other, I won't spoil any of these moments, as you should most definately experiance for themselves, but I can say that if the game hits any nail on the head, it is most definately in this aspect. Some may find some distaste in the campy/cheesy/sometimes downright TERRIBLE diolouge in this game, but I personally loved it, and I found myself getting excited when I was playing through the game, and a cutscene would appear, because it meant I would get a chuckle or two out of it. Something should also be said about the soundtrack, as it fits the surreal, quirky atmosphere of the game perectly. The game is also quite lengthy, with various sidequests you can do, in addition to the main story.  Now, many people wouldn't find this justification to buy this game, that the gameplay and graphics completely ruin the experiance, but I would seriously disagree. It seems to me that this game had a lot of love, and effort put behind it, but the game developers skills just didn't match up to what they were hoping would turn out. As I said, some may not like this game, some may even hate this game, but to those who want a different experiance, something that is out of norm, and completely changes the way you would normally think about games, I'd say give this game a go. I've bought this game three times already, on the Xbox 360, PS3, and of course PC, and I haven't regretting buying a single copy. This game will give you a unforgetable ride, which must be played to be believed. In my opinion, this is without a doubt, the best worst game I have ever played. AND I LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT.

Rating:9/10
586	1	a	Lucius. I can keep going on and on about this game. It's so freakin' awesome! Simply be a kid of 6 years old and murder your family and friends around it! Funny and cool. The graphics are not that good, but it will have to do. The game is about Lucius, the 6 years old kid. The story is about him, he is the devil's son. At the 6th day of the 6th month on his 6th birthday (or let's say: 666) he becomes evil. His first kill is the old maid, which we don't care about, since she had too much icecream (you'll get the joke when you play it).  One thing creeped me out the most, since that the graphics aren't that good, the face of the people don't show any emotions, not that much at least. For Lucius this is even worse, his black eyes, looking through your skin, no emotions, only pure evil. The game is not scary at all, but his face scared me.  The only spoiler I will make is that there are 2 different game-ends, you'll have to pick the one you are attracted too.  It's no open world, that's the saddest thing about the game, you can not leave the house/garden. It's actually a really small map which you can walk in. Luckily you'll get something better later, to move around.  I recommend this game to all of you. If you like to play the bad guy some time, then this is it. Murder your family and their friends for fun, nobody expects the kid to be the killer! Watch out for some signs though, they make you weak. For a decent price, for me at least, it's great. Though, it's only singleplayer, so it still might be too expensive. If you buy it: You're awesome, Have fun!
142	1	a	It is too bad Gas Powered Games didn`t have success with this title. It *is* likely the best game of its kind, even to this day. A problematic networking history hobbled them early, preventing 100% of their post-launch efforts from providing enormous expansion. That said, still an extremely worthy diversion. Solid mechanics, very thoroughly developed &amp; unique characters to play.

1781	1	a	  Homefront: The Revolution is a mixed bag, but I think it ultimately prevails as an above average open world FPS. I played this game a good bit through its free weekend, and I enjoyed it. There's many reasons why its a mixed bag, so lets get to those reasons, shall we?   Positives

1600	1	a	I have to recommend this game, I have been a fan of games with this stye and have played the original Homefront. Since the 2.0 patch dropped I can definitley see a huge increase in performance. I recommend getting the game while it is on sale as I feel it will definitley be worth it.  Edit: I forgot to mention this, the animations do seem a little robotic but I'm not too big on that being a problem personally.

Trully i'm really enjoying it, mostly i loved it's gameplay, visual quality, features, weapon systems and combat stuffs, location, in-game details, story. I actually like serious situations where we have to do something for our city, out country and our world. In these types of situations, you will get amazing missions to play with hard gameplay. So sometimes you have to be tricy and stealthy for hard atmospheres but sometimes you have to rush like hit and run. In this case, opponents gonna be serious and also seek for attack. So this title is just like my type, like what i wanted from developers. So let me explain about it in few topics.  Gameplay I got so much things to say about it. There is hella cool fun out there. We have so much things to do there. You will get tons of side quests and mini tasks as much as you explore it around the world. Also you would be rewarded with dollars if you complete these side quests and help civilians. There will be few civilians will ask you to help them like donating some dollars to beggers, releasing prisons, killing bullies and many more. In-game, whole world will be in control of KPA soldiers. Because they sorrounded the whole town and distructing it. So you can recruite your team soldiers around the town to help you to capture strike points, KPA strongholds, KPA covoys. Sometimes you need to use hack stuffs for hacking their Apex technology what is in used to sucure regions from revolutionary soldiers and recruits. So it's hella amazing.  Optimization We all know this game got some issues for bugs, FPS drops. But in my experience, i didn't yet face any bugs but FPS drops. It has to be fixed as soon as possible. Because it's not so cool for it. But i have to say this title isn't so well optimized. It's seems really bad on optimization. So not getting so high FPS. But playing on ultra high setting with all maxed out except AA.  Visual Quality/GFX I'm really amazed with it's visual. Seems so perfect and remarkable in all the way. But at night it looks far more amazing than it seems at day time. I can see they really putted perfection on it. Too much highly detailed breathing and lively world. So there is more fun to play at night situation with my recruits i choose. So you won't be disappointed for visuals  Coolest Features There are lots of amazing and cool features for best gameplay ever. Let's start with the smartphone you will get in-game for directions, journals, contacts, map, camera, identifications, emails, texts. You can use your camera to identify and mark hostiles and KPA threats. So it's really helpful for all of us in high risky spots where we have to be stealthy. With message feature you can contact with your alleys to direct you. You can craft hacking stuffs, pipe bombs, GTK stuffs. For crafting you can get resources around the world. Also you can buy them from safe house. In these situations you may need much more ammos, so you will get tons of stashes there but those are hidden for not showing KPA soldiers because if they get any stashes in their hands, they may remove them. Also you can upgrade your weapons for heavy armored cars, patrolls, goliath, turrets, KPA drones.  Lemme rate this title in few ways + Gameplay : 10/10 + Visual Quality : 9/10 - Optimization : 5/10 + Combating weapons and stuffs : 7/10 + Location and Details : 9/10 + Characters : 7/10 + Features : 10/10 + Background Scores : 9/10  Pros + Wise Storyline + Quiet Remarkable Gameplay Experience + Stunning and Gorgeus Visuals + Enjoyable Epic Actions + Serious and Effective Situations + Quiet Hard Missions and Side Quests + Helpful Recruits Available Around The City For Better Combat Action + Rocking Background Scores Matching With Situations + Atmospheric Situations  Cons - In-game Progress Saving Feature - No Crosshair -  So overally this is the best title for me in every way i experienced till now. Those who loved and enjoyed Crysis 2, they will surely love this one as well. Because gameplay situations and atmospheres are quiet familier. Let's burn them in the fire of revolution...
2740	1	a	From the very start of the game (albeit after fixing the crash issues) I was hooked. A survival horror game with elements of comedy, with an open world environment and a charismatic protagonist makes it a cult favorite. The games story (for a brief summary you are an Special FBI Agent investigation an interesting murder case) gives you a lot of clues and expansive knowledge for the player to deduce and question who did it with so many suspects you'll be sure to doubt your prime suspects, but do not fret as the pieces will fall in place nicely and pave a wonderful intense and dramatic story.   This game deserves a 10/10, however due to the pc port issues, bugs, and numerous crashes it recieves a 8/10.

301	0	a	  While the premise is interesting, the amount of glitches and the lack of in-game direction leaves an unholy taint not suitable for anyone.
1655	1	a	  It's an okay game.   The story intrigues me at the start but after that, it gets boring real fast - Same goes with the gameplay. I do like the gun customization though.

891	0	a	I'd like to say it takes quite a bit for me to write a negative review and I'll be as fair as I can be in evaluating Lucius. Pros: + Interesting concept, especially if you enjoyed 'The Omen' movies + Good Scenery + Decently made creepy â¥â¥â¥ kid (with those black soulless eyes)  Cons:  - Short (it did take me 6 hours to finish the game, 70% of the achievements done, and I wasn't trying) - No character development for anyone, whatsoever - Meh voice-acting - Falls flat in the story department - who am I kidding? There is no story, just the average day-to-day life of a satanic six year old hell-bent on murdering everyone he meets. - The missions and gameplay are ridicuously linear, and by this I mean you can not advance a mission without completing a certain step and there are no alternative paths. You have to kill THIS person, exactly this way, no exceptions. There are no choices made or options left up to the player. - The gameplay was frankly a bit boring. I had to force myself to sit down and finish the game and feel no inclination to ever come back to this game, even uninstalling it after I finished.   All in all, if you're looking for intuitive, active gameplay with a rich story, this is NOT the game for you. If you're looking for more of a narrative game experience, this is probably more along your lines. I would not pay the regular $10 for this game - my friend bought it for me as a gift during a sale for a few dollars, and I'm not sure I would have paid that.
533	1	a	Very good game, especcialy for those, who want to play games with light part of fantasy. Game is something like Risen 2 and Harry Potter, but it's something better.  
1767	1	a	Huge improvement over the first but still feels rushed worth picking up on a cheap sale i would say Â£5 or so still has its share of bugs performance is erratic and character models seem to just apprear infront of you sometimes XD enemies and civilians
1704	1	a	Based off of the free weekend I tried, The only thing wrong I see about this game is that the performance is balls.   Other than that, its got a decent story with nice cutscenes, even the voiceover is good like you can tell the devs put a lot of effort. The graphics are really good too. It even plays like your typical Far Cry game but the setting is what really does it for me.   Set in Philadellphia where North Koreans have treated Americans like dogs, you must rebel and start resistances throughout different parts of the city to ultimately overthrow the 'Norks'. That is so sick! In Far Cry, you are just getting signals and revealing parts of the map!   Trust me, if this game was the original Homefront, people would LOVE this game. I think the reason why people hate on it hard is because of two things.  1) Poor optimization = I personally get 40-60 fps on a gtx 970, amd 8320fx and 16gb ram. I get that, that sucks but it does NOT warrant a negative review UNLESS the devs are not putting out patches.  From what I understand, they have been pumping patches and actually have a pastebin where they want people to submit their dxdiag logs to see what causes the issue.   THAT IS EFFORT. THEY ARE TRYING. WHY DONT YOU BECOME A DEV AND SEE WHY YOUR GAME LAGS ON DIFFERENT BUILDS. DO YOU SEE HOW IT COULD TAKE TIME TO DIAGNOSE THAT?  2) Unoriginal 'Far Cry 3' gameply - It has that 'scavenge, resource, and take over base' gameplay thats been replicated a lot. I dont mind it. That is all I did the first 3 hours and enjoyed it. If you dont likE that gameplay, that is also fine. It just suits different people well.  Overall, I plan on buying the game since the free weekend help me form an opinion on it.

2038	0	a	  I got to play around 2h on a free weekend, and I kinda liked what I got to play. It started out very... 'cinematic' - as in: holding your hand. After about 30min it starts to open up and you get a playground to do smaller missions in and a main quest line to finish. I thought they captured the us vs them feeling pretty good.  Unfortunately, after about 1h I got severe performance problems. I started to rubber-band across the level (like playing with a bad Internet connection), so movement got all skippy. After 2h it started to crash each time it tried to load a save game. So don't buy this on a whim, but really try it out after buying it, to make sure it runs well for you.

1226	1	a	The Story: Basically those lovely Government Scientists have been having some creative fun with their chemistry sets. Causing a lovely accident that has turned the inhabitants of an entire city into shambling aggressive Zombies. Which of course you are asked to kill as many as you can while doing missions for the military.  Game play: What can I say. Its top downish drive shoot and ram to kill zombies, while doing missions. All good ol fun if you like killing zombies.   The Graphics: They are simple and good enough in my view for the game. But for those who are picky and want things looking really like real life then this would probably effect them. But for this game I say its just right.  Controls: Controls are simple nothing to hard to learn. SWAD for movement LMB for shooting and RMB for Nitro. Petty simple there is other combos for the the controls as well as game pad. But I just stuck with the Keyboard n mouse. Still fun with them.  The Music: It does go nice with the game. It even had the feel of some older games, the names escape me at this point though. It certainly fits the style of game.  The Reply Value: With the other game styles you can get and the dlc. There is some reply value in it. Plus am sure the any zombie killing lover will reply it a lot.  Bugs/Glitches: I could not see any bugs or glitches that could effect my game play of this game. But remember that's not saying that they might pop up for others. But for me none what so ever.  Overall: Its a fun zombie killing game, with some nice graphics that suit the game. Easy to use controls, music that go's with the game in my view. Certainly has reply for those zombie killing lovers. No bugs or glitches that I can see. Story was to me generic, but that's me. So in my view this is a nice game to play. So I give it a 7 out of 10.
560	1	a	loved the game and story But there are like 2 bugs that made it were i had to restart the level to get by but that wasent a big deal at all i played chapters 1-3 my first night than I started today again and beat it in like 8 hours ha i say well worth the money
2508	1	a	This is a game that you really want to like, but at the same time hate it with the power of 300 foremans grill. It is a diffcult mistress as she punish you for every misstep you make but she rewards you when you make good. What I'm trying to say, is that this game is HAAARRD. It will make you want to slam your keyboard against the deck. I like this game and I hate it at the same time. Bottomline is, that you if have no patince (like me) be prepare for game over. A lot. It is a good game here but you will get mad at it.

3071	1	a	Tried to play it on the keyboard and mouse. This seems much better suited to a controller. Fun game but needs a controller to avoid mega hand cramps and limited functionality.
2853	1	a	This game is amazing. One of the funniest games I've ever played, and one of the only few games to capture that B-grade movie feeling of low budget, roughness and unnintentional humour. If you can overlook bugs and technical flaws you are out for quite an experience.  Can't recommend it highly enough!

1531	0	a	Agreed with everyone else. There's an overly long into with no interaction and a pretty lackluster experiene waiting for you at the end of it. Performance is okay- there's some hitching here and there but mostly smooth. The FOV is sickeninly narrow and I did not see a slider. It's possible I just didn't look hard enough though. Guns don't feel good and it's just an all around average to bad game. Try it for free then uninstall after 30min.
1149	1	a	So in this game you play as a kid who kills people........also hes â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.  Get this game.

1651	0	a	  I played this on one of the recent free weekends.   TL;DR version; It's a decent game, but the areas feel repetitive and it lacks story depth. The price is not justified. $10 USD max IMHO.   As someone who played the first Homefront game, this is heading in a better direction but it's not quite there yet and generally feels like a console port. Love was not really put into the PC version IMHO. case and point in literally the first scene of the game you are on the floor and you can see how bad the floor textures are. They are more than do able but not for the current price tag of $40 USD and or the current sale price of $23.99 USD. If this game was under $10 USD then I would be way more willing to suggest it as it feels like it's worth that much on PC.   The different districts don't feel that different at all. It feels like more of the same. Yes they may look slightly less warzoney but it still feels like a warzone and they pretty much function the same way when you are taking over areas.  The AI has some issues as well. If you recruit some of the AI to help you then tend to get stuck in stairways and various other random places. And I will say that I do think it's kinda immersion breaking when early on in the game if one of the airship spots you they will send out guys and go into an alert phase while if they spot any of the AI nothing happens. I understand this was most likely done for gameplay reasons but it is kinda pretty immersion breaking to me.  The game is a bit broken it terms of it's own rules as it's stated in one of the tutorial videos that if you are currently in an alert phase that the safe houses will not take you in. When I was in the 2nd zone of the game (where the video is played the first time you go there) I would repeatedly just head to one of the safe houses if I was close and under an alert and they still let me in. It would end and I would walk out like nothing happened.  The story does not feel very deep. And really not much changes when you go from area to area from what I've played. I will also say that a lot of the gear upgrades feel spaced out to make you grind for them.

Every time I went to join a random match it never finds anything, and when I choose to open a server nobody ever joins. This game is a huge dissapointment to me, a huge waste of $59.99... If I were you I would not waste the money to buy this stupid game and get something better like Battleborn or something.

2805	1	a	Very bug ridden game with terrible gameplay mechanics, shooting straight outta RE4, dressing system that does nothing. And the game looks like a PS2 era release. That being said it's one of my most favorite games ever released, horrible PC port though and that makes me sad, the games quirks all come together to make a very compelling story, finding out who did the murders was a thrill ride up until the very end. I'd say, if you can don't buy for PC but if it's your only option look for bugfixes, it's honestly a solid bar of gold under all the â¥â¥â¥â¥ on top of it. Rarely will you find a game as great as this one.
309	1	a	Quite an entertaining game. Would certainly recommend if found in a bundle or on sale.  Puzzles and gameplay are fairly simplistic, but the entertainment for me came from the darkness of it. You are running around as an evil child...
1727	0	a	  Expected more of the game! I feel there is no story, And voice spoken npc but not the main character? it feel dull and i feel 0% for the main charater  The open world is broken. If the army is trying to find you just climb up a roof or something and *poof* your gone, The bots dont even fly up to check you. Most of the army is just spawning in while you look at them, The riots make everything a piece of cake... Realllyy....  Just sad overalll. Wished the game was better...

648	0	a	I will admit I haven't played the game very far in (as far as I can tell), but it just felt bland. The first few kills had no challenge to them, as the game basically told me what to do. Then the next one, the butcher, found me in a room with no intuitive way to kill him at all as far as I could tell. I looked up a guide and without giving spoilers, it didn't feel creative or fun. Sure, it may sound like I want this game to both be easy and hard all at once, but quite frankly, if the in game journal didn't tell me how to beat the first kills, I probably would have wandered around this massive house even longer than I did. This game was advertised as being some interesting psychological thriller where I get to plot my family's demise and frame victims, but I didn't feel in control of my gameplay experience at all. I got a game that said 'click this, put this here, someone dies', and if that's what I wanted out of a game, I'd have just downloaded The Sims and lit a house on fire.
2844	1	a	If you love Twin Peaks, then you'd love this! This is basically Twin Peaks the game. Am I right, Zach?
3072	1	a	Intersting platformer that makes you work. It's basically your normal indie game. Cool background with pixelated characters and cool filters. Not much of a story as you are kind of just sent to wander around and collect things. The music is AWESOME. All in, worth the 2.99 I spent on the humble bundle. Don't know if I would have spent more than that for this game. Fun, but not worth spending too much money.

2420	1	a	The shooting mechanics are decent. The cinematics are cool too. The intro is lllllooooonnnnnng. It's I don't know, I hate that crap. The overall feel like Half life 2 in a way, which ticked a box for me. That may be what's keeping me playing, some sort of nostalgia not sure yet.  Just started it, I'm 59 minutes into it. So far, it's decent. It's got it's moments, and some stupid moments like when you 'hack' (can't even call it that, moving a mouse around is pretty lame why even bother) the relay tower after you meet Dana - the whole base is suddenly built while your in the room.    I'm disliking the currency far cry style vending machines. It's still early I understand, so I can't really judge it hard. I also just figured out I'm playing the second homefront (just looked it up) so oops. Makes me think I need to stop playing this and go play that then this. Hmm

1052	1	a	I donât know where I was or what I was doing in 2012, but I canât see why I did not grab this game sooner. This is one of those games where you get deep into the story so much so that you lose all sense of time until you finish the game and then have that â what now?â look on your face as you thrust for more. I really liked this game.   What I liked:  The storyline: It gives you a bit of background on the Lucius as to he just fell out of the sky. The story make the player connect with him and get personally involved with him. Freaking awesome!!   What I did not like:     Conclusion: This is a game I would highly recommend getting. It may be a bit old, but it is outstanding in my opinion. I did not have any trouble starting the game, or playing it and I donât recall any bugs that made me not want to play the game. It does have some replay value and a mini survival like game at the end which I liked also. Awesome to say the least.

343	1	a	Lucius lets you play as the titular 7 years old Antichrist, you'll be killing a whole mansion just to appease Satan: while as fun as it sounds sadly the experience is marred by quite a few problems.   PROS:   -great soundtrack sets the tone for the game  -gory kills  -you'll develop some fairly interesting powers  -an expansive mansion for you to explore  -being a 7yo murdering spawn of Satan is surely fun   NEUTRAL:   -the game is VERY bleak, you're murdering/framing innocents and there's no sense of humour whatsoever to balance things: so I guess such a dreary game isn't for everyone   CONS:   -sadly there's only one way to kill your inteded victims, this makes the game experience quite restrictive  -some of the objects needed are small and/or stuck in hard to find places, keep a guide handy if you get frustrated  -stealth sections can get annoying  -clunky inventory  -no controller support  -repetitive npc speech  -last boss battle feels pretty silly   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=457387627   While Lucius might look like an Hitman clone the restrictions put on who/how to kill and the object hunts required to find the items you need makes it game more of a puzzle game than anything else: it's quite hard to shake the feeling that the whole gaming experience is fairly limited and that it'd have been so much more. Still, if you can deal with the limits the game puts on you and do not get too frustrated by the pixel hunts it can provide a few pleasant hours as you try to figure out what to do and enjoy the bloody results of your labor: just get it on sale when it drops under the 2$ mark.

2554	1	a	If I ever wrote a book with a video game topic the title would be '1 Video Game You Must Play Before You Die' and Deadly Premonition would be the subject. In it you would find countless of analysis of the many citizens of Greenvale, a complete study of the main characters quirks and flaws, how to make your own Sinner's Sandwich and why you always should keep your suit pressed and clean.  Hell, I would probably end up writing a sequel. There is just so much going on in this game that one book simply couldn't content everything that needs to be said about Deadly Premonition.   There are lot of great games out there, but in my view there is only about 3 games that have ever gone far and beyond and pushed what a game really is capable of being. A game that changes the way you will look at games. A game that makes you realize what a fantastic medium games can be, if it's utilized for more than simply being another entertainment form to ultimately make you pass time. A game that ruins gaming.  Deadly Premonition is all that. It's impossible to describe exactly what it is that makes it such a fantastic game. Most people will only shake their heads and it's like trying to describe a miracle to people who never witnessed one.

2706	1	a	Deadly Premonition is what you'd get if you asked Suda 51 to direct the new Silent Hill game, as opposed to giving to â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Hideo Kojima of all people. Everyone seems like they're on drugs, the dialogue is janky and awkward, everything is strange and weird. It does add a really nice atmosphere, the deluded sense that something is terrible and wrong but no one else really seems to notice. I mean, more than just a crazy serial killer. Francis York Morgan is a pretty good protagonist, his David Duchovny FBI cool makes him a likable guy and although he as well seems to be on a variety of drugs, he is the most rational and enjoyable to be with. It's one of the best horror games on steam, save for Amnesia and Condemned and is totally worth buying.

3016	1	a	â Poor graphics â Poor sounds â Poor optimisation  â The best game I've ever played â
1934	1	a	I don't know what the complaining is all about. I do understand why the negetive reviews when it first came out but I started to play after all of the patches and it runs fine for me. I think that the people who are saying that their games are crashing after the updates aren't being honest with themselves or people about what their computers can handle or if it's even stable. I am running this on a 3-4 year old Alienware 18 laptop at medium settings at I have no issues at all. It's even locked in at 60 FPS and the game still looks amazing. I'm pretty sure that most people are trying to run the game at ultra when we all know that this has the cryengine and it's a very demanding engine.   As for the game review. I've only played 1 hour and 15 minutes so I don't know the storyline that well yet but I'm enjoying the open world aspect of it. I love games like this so it's my cup of tea but not for everybody. I think that people wanted a call of duty type of game when they bought into this game and was let down. I personaly believe that people have too high of expectations these days and do not remember back in the day when you got a glitchy game for $60 and it was like 5 hours long. The AI isn't that great on it but I am going to try a harder level to see what that's like.  One thing that annoys me is that I keep seeing reviews on people that are hating the game and not recommending it have 40+ hours soaked into the game. I don't know about you but I refuse to put that many hours into something I really hate. I also do not take bad reviews for people that have spent .2 hours on it as well. Not even sure if my 1.25 hours count but I just wanted to say that it's stable and like the game.   As for the price? I do think the $25 I spent on it is worth it and I also think that the developers are trying real hard to make the game great. Definately wait for the next sale.   There you go, my two cents worth. You can either hate it or like it but either way I'm going to keep playing this game because I enjoy it and do not care about people that whine about everything.

324	1	a	Let's be as clear as we can about a few things up front: Lucius is not the best designed game. Its puzzles are often meant to be solved by sending you on a linear path from clue to clue, but that path can be broken by the fact that it's a fairly open world. An NPC might send you to a specific room and the game might expect that you pick up a certain item from it and infer from context that it's to be used in this chapter. But if you picked that item up 5 chapters ago, you might be struggling to make that connection, and instead scour the room for ways to use any of its other set pieces. Some mechanics are clumsy, there's a bit of pixel hunting, and the logic stringing puzzles together can be weird and opaque. You should play the game with another person or a guide to help hammer through it.  All that said, Lucius is pretty fun. For all its kludginess and opacity, it still lets you murder everyone in the house in exchange for rad powers from Satan, and there's a simple joy in running throughout the mansion inverting all the crosses so you can live like a tr00 kvlt six-year-old of the bitter frozen necrofrost. If only you could wear corpse-paint like the band Immortal to let the normals know where you stand.

2724	1	a	I hate almost every mechanic you will find here.  Quick Time Events - Terrible in general and horribly executed here Open World - With Mostly Empty Space is what I automatically read after I see this description and it absolutely appies here Survival Horror - Resource managment that amounts to making sure you have enough food to last the day, the timeless and endless searching for keys to open doors, and being forced to hide from an assailiant in a locker despite the fact that you have 160 rounds in your submachine gun ready to be unloaded.  The combat is TERRIBLE and I was not suprised at all to find out it was tacked on at the last minute to try and appeal to 'western gamers' at the publishers request.  To top it all the optimization is exceptionally poor and will likely require you to download some quickfixes via mods (check forums) to run.  Yet I love this game. It's strange beyond reason and the completely broken parts of the game (almost everything) somehow manage to accentuate the one thing that works with this game. The off-center, campy, almost familiar, touching, and beyond words oddball yet enchancting atmosphere.  Agent York is stranger still than the atmosphere and he's one of the most memorable characters in video games.   This might not be for you but on discount you really need to find out if it might be.  9/10 if it is....

2967	1	a	Buying this game is a catch-22. If you buy it, SWERY is able to eat and make more awesome games, but you're also supporting the malpractice of horribly broken PC ports. If you don't buy it (or don't play it), the devs won't want to port to PC in the first place.  Then again, a few sales earned or lost 3 years after the original release isn't going to have much effect on the developers.  Mods can fix it, but they don't prevent the crashes that set you back 30 minutes
1380	1	a	It's worth the price if it's on sale. I just came back to this game to review it and saw it's on sale for 2.50, so that's a good price. The full 10.00 is a bit high though. Actual multiplayer races would've been fantastic. The dialogue makes me think it was written in another language and translated back to English. Mechanics and the game itself were fun though. I liked the tropical map, in fact, the graphics overall were wonderful! Some levels felt like they were designed to punish you for even trying to beat the challenges set up for you. But you know what? I had fun and I think it's worth it- on sale that is. The assets were well done and woven together, but the story was a mess... my review is as messy as the experience I had.
2299	0	a	why does this game exsist because it sucks
593	0	a	This game plays and looks like it was built with a Unity â¥â¥â¥â¥ing engine alright, i'v seen â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Yandere Simulator capture the same gameplay, but compairing the 2 just makes this game look like a joke. The Story for Lucius was amazing, hands down, 10/10, but the execution was down right â¥â¥â¥â¥ing stupid. If i am the son of satan and i can launch â¥â¥â¥â¥ing fireballs to kill people, i should have the option to do this. This is what makes Yandere Simulator so much better, it's not even finished yet, and i can already tell that it is better than this game. 3/10, Amazing story, voice acting and graphics, but the gameplay â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sucks.  Edit: I forgot to mention, i beat this game in a single afternoon while eating a pizza. Puzzles are not creative and boring. Dont buy Lucius 2 either, Lucius 2 goes for the kind of, do it yourself type of game. But that game down right glitched and did nothing to make me entertained. This series of games is stupid, make a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing book with the same concept to enjoy this to the fullest.

1642	1	a	  Was a bad game, now a quite good game, not the best, but pretty great right now. Hopefully more stability patches are released, and I think I'll purchase it now. (Played the beta before release and replayed the free Steam weekend.)
2073	1	a	It's got a slow start and it's buggy in parts but it's a damn fine game - AND it has two levels from Timesplitters in it. Personally, I enjoyed it but it might not be for you. I would make sure you watch some gameplay videos before making a purchase as this game isn't for everyone.  But I commend the developers work, after all the fluff they dealt with to get this game to market - It's a really solid product when it could have been a total flop. The developers obviously worked hard no matter the situation they were in to bring this game to life and it shows. A lot of love went into into and as I said, I enjoyed it quite a lot.

1506	0	a	Thank you Deep Silver and Dambuster for the free weekend. Unfortunately, this game is not very good.   Ostensibly a mix of Far Cry, Stalker and Freedom Fighters, it soon reveals itself to be a mere Crysis-alike with a gimmick. The weapon customization menu probably gave that away to some of you.  The story is very predictable and at times comically vile. And it's absolutely terrible! There's no reason to play Homefront: The Revolution for the story, its perfunctory rah-rah patriot â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t doesn't even compare favorably to the Call of Duty garbage of a few years back.   But does it at least play well? Eh... not really. The gunplay and movement is typical for CryEngine - that is to say not very good. Even smooth 60+ fps can't hide the weird player movement and unsatisfying gun action. The novel weapons aren't really fun to use, which is an absolute bummer.   Painting the map blue by liberating outposts and strongholds also loses its draw after the first map. The concept of Yellow Zones is interesting on the surface, but completely wasted in practice. Sprinting past guards takes care of every problem. The world just doesn't feel believable or internally consistent.  Homefront certainly isn't a terrible game, but with the amount of quality games available today, why play a thoroughly mediocre one?

2900	1	a	in my mind this game is a masterpiece, its like a drawing done by a 5 year old though, the execution is horrid but the idea behind it is amazing. firstly i dont know why it does it for me, this has ONLY happened to me, not even the dev knows why, but my cutscenes are really messed up and i will put a link so you can see.  https://www.dropbox.com/s/5wdfh902guxatyg/2014-04-07_00002.jpg?dl=0  - that is supposed to be the intro  https://www.dropbox.com/s/ugttu4sqy8ro2uv/2014-04-07_00003.jpg?dl=0  - thats supposed to be the main menu  now onto the pros: the game has a very interesting story. there is a lot to do has the classic intentional bad dialogue some rather strange humor a horror aspect in an open world  now the cons: this game is astonishingly buggy there are constant issues no matter what its controls are a bit wonky by default but can be changed no graphical options.  all in all if i myself could fix the cutscene issue this would be one of my favorite games even with its issues.
118	1	a	An amazing game that suffered a poor launch, and could have been as big as League of Legends if it wasn't for stardock messing up their end of the job with the netcode. Demigod was a true victim of Piracy, at launch it had around 18,000 units sold while there were over 100,000 players on the servers.   Extremely solid ARTS, all of the characters work well together and are interesting enough. Voice acting is ok. The music is cliche but definitely good enough to get you into those intense moments. Graphics mostly hold up to today's standards even though the game is from 2009.

3051	1	a	If you like anything Nifflas has ever done or if you like everything he's ever done, you will like this game. This like the original Knytt + Stories + Saira all rolled into one with extra on top. If you play the demo don't think that this game is as short as the first two chapers. The world starts for real in chapter 3 and is 49x49 screen with tons of secrets. You will also see lots of things from previous games (locations, items, references). The world building here is amazing, Nifflas uses everything available to create a real sense of a different but real place.  You are Mi Sprocket, a sprite who cannot talk. But the game has conversations, how does this work? Soon you will get two companions and you can choose who should have the conversation each time. Your companions have quite different world views. The story is not a fixed story but creates an incredible sense of a journey and you feel your companions have real growth.   The graphics are beautiful. Coming from previous Nifflas games I didn't like the silhouettes at first but once you see how it is used in combination with the backgrounds it becomes apparent it is his best style yet. It manages to be so atmospheric. Especially in combination with the sound and music. There are over 100 tracks (which you can download for free on his site).  My game of 2013.   PS: My playtime is low because I played the non steam version back in March. The game is 20+ hours easily.
2405	1	a	  I got this game on the free weekend (sept 2016) and it was a BLAST!   Steam's review system should document if the reviewer's system meets specs and has up to date drivers (or at least if the reviewer claims they do), because I think a lot of people grabbed a free game hoping it'd run on a sub-spec system and they lashed out at the game when it didn't. Why else would someone make a complaint that isn't even legit... 'too few guns?' It has at least pistol, pnematic pistol, smg, crossbow, blunderbuss, AR, battle rifle, LMG, shotgun, limpet gun, and RPG. Add to that 4 types of thrown weapons (incendiary, explosive, hack tool, distractor) each with 4 subtypes, total 16. Plus knife, bolt cutters, flashlight...  With the difficulty on recruit mode it was non-stop action. I'm sure more stealth is needed at higher diffuculties. Free-running though controlled zones looking for targets of opportunity like equipment sabotage targets and lone soldiers to silent-takedown... jumping from scaffolding to rooftops and through upper floor windows, looting valuables... frantically looking for a dumpster or portapotty to hide in... what's not to love? It's like Mirror's Edge meets Far Cry. Plenty of side missions can be done in any order or ignored as you like. It took 16 hours for the main mission and about half the side missions, none of the job missions, and very few of the flash missions (optional missions that appear without warning).  I love the game's moral choices... imagine you are an operative in an occupied zone on an important mission and you get an opportunity to save some civilians getting a beatdown from bully occupiers, but only by blowing your cover. Take the chance or sacrifice them... clock's ticking! Will you use remote explosives blindly with the possibility an innocent will walk by them?  The characters are well fleshed out. Dana's a complete psychopath, the doc has his own priorities, reasonable characters all have different outlooks on the occupation, the NPC chatter is diverse and on topic, and I didn't see the game re-use any faces for different people, very well done. The graphics are amazing - at one point while hiding behind a dirty old dumpster next to a chain fence with ivy growing on it I felt like I was looking at a real photo.  I had 2 crashes to desktop during the my entire 16 hour campaign. Core i7, 16gb, GTX970.

2462	1	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7d1kBznlSo&amp;feature=youtu.be   Inquisitor: Inquisitor is an old styled RPG from an isometric point of view. You take on the role of an inquisitor of one of three classes, the paladin, thief or priest. You are set upon the world of Ultherst to save it from damnation by rooting out the witch and heretic and banishing evil from the hearts of the innocent. Inquisitor is a fairly simple game with an amazing premise; it really ends up playing out like a detective game of crime solving. You will go and get testimonyâs, witnesses, evidence and find the truth behind the conspiracy's and paranoia of the down trodden people of Ultherst and in doing so, discover a dangerous and incredibly evil plot against humanity. The story and setting in Inquisitor is incredible and very unique, Iâve never seen a game quite like this, and itâs got a heavy dark setting with a very gothic overtone and style, beautifully created environments and music that really makes you feel like you are doing god's work. As far as storytelling, the game is stellar, the game truly falters in its execution of its combat, you will constantly need to carry bags full of potions and drink from them constantly just to stay alive, and the combat itself is very monotonous, couple that with the strange design choice of including stamina which you use for any combat action and once depleted you can do nothing and it really takes out the intensity of combat and really becomes more of chore than something you want to do. This is made into an even bigger problem further since the game will have you go through huge dungeons with multiple floors and quickly respawning enemies. You will end up fighting through throngs of enemies just to get to the next Act or finish a side quest and without any satisfaction it gets very challenging to push yourself through to enjoy more of the story. Challenge is also something that bogs the game down, this game is difficult even on easy, enemies will take an insane amount of damage before dropping while you can easily be killed, you'll be saving and loading often in this game and it isn't necessarily because the monsters pose a challenge, but rather that they have a lot of health and you don't. My recommendation for the combat system is to build a range character and use hit and run tactics, and ONLY play on easy. This isn't the kind of challenge that feels good to overcome. Itâs really a shame since Inquisitor is a game I would like to see a sequel for; its setting is truly a dark fantasy, complete with torture, paranoia, violent crimes and true evil. I would love to see more of this world or game of a similar setting, Inquisitor really suffers from a very bad combat system that is unfortunately forced upon you as you are expected to do a lot of fighting. It's only $9.99 USD and I rarely see it on sale, if you do, I'd pick it up and check out the story and see how you like the crime solving, otherwise, unless you can get past the combat system, it'll be very hard to justify the price, even if the story is great.   TL/DR; Inquisitor is a very hard (not in a good way) RPG where you play a holy man (out of three available choices) who is asked to find the answers behind the evil plaguing Ultherst and save the souls of the innocent. The premise is dark, grim and gothic, with beautiful music and crafted settings, the game really suffers from a horrible combat system that the game seems to think you'll enjoy because it gives you gigantic dungeons with many floors to go through before you can even think of advancing to the next act. It doesn't help the game is so difficult even on the easiest difficulty, for really no reason. I enjoyed the story, but, itâs tough to recommend. I rarely see it go on sale too, if you do see it pick it up, otherwise spending $9.99 is a tough price for a game you might not play past the first few hours. Oh and be prepared to read, a lot.   -Middle of the Road from Royial

2384	0	a	  Finished the single player during the free weekend, which for all the claims of being 'fixed' still suffered from several serious technical issues such as:  *Horrendous mouse input lag (200+ms) until I turned off supersampling (despite flawless frame rate thanks to my 1080GTX) *various GUI errors, keyboard prompts being replaced with joypad ones for no apparent reason for the duration of a mission *hard crash between missions that caused save corruption (clicking resume at the main menu after restarting the game did nothing, had to manually reload the previous autosave to continue)  Still, while the single player was mediocre at best at least I got through it.   Co-op on the other hand is completely broken right now. Cannot join a single game, so there is no reason to buy it after the free weekend ends.
1889	1	a	its a good game but the devs realy need to fix the issue where you do the police station liberation before it comes up in the storyline ( it makes it impossible to re rescue micky for the storyline )
1601	1	a	The game divides itself between these open Red Zone battlefields and the (slightly) more civilised Yellow Zones. These are run down urban areas where the oppressed American population live under the angry, stompy boot of the Korean Army. They play out much like the Red Zones - open areas with multiple objectives leading up to a final goal - but add in a barely formed stealth mechanic and a far more stern response if youâre seen. Get spotted and itâs a case of running away, breaking line of sight and waiting out the alarm. Itâs likely something youâll be doing a lot. Because these areas are more built up itâs easier to get caught or cornered when things do go south.     Homefront: The Revolution manages to be entertaining without ever completely delivering on its open world warfare potential. Thereâs definitely an interesting game here if you fancy a different paced shooter. Thereâs just a few bits that don't quite click. The pace between the Red and Yellow Zones doesnât flow as smoothly as it could, for example. The scrappy free roam fighting can deliver some great moments, but just as equally frustrate with loops of dying and respawning (the more restrictive set pieces fights can be especially guilty of this) and guns just don't feel... 'right'. Combined it all keeps Homefront at the level of âbasically okayâ.   7/10

2559	1	a	Every generation of video games has a set of titles that completely flies under most gamersâ radar. Games such as Killer 7 and Snatcher are among those that fall into the elusive, Cult Classic category. See, a Cult Classic game is one that hasnât really been met with commercial success but has garnered a dedicated fanbase despite that fact. Now, as a lowly gamer I canât do much about these games and I wish more people actually played them, but Iâll be damned if I donât do my part to at least spread awareness about games that I think deserve much more attention than they are currently getting. One of these games is Deadly Premonition: The Directorâs Cut. Deadly Premonition: The Directorâs Cut is an HD remake of the same game released in 2010 on Xbox 360 and PS3(Japan Only). The new game sports updated visuals, move support and some new DLC, scenarios and an extended ending. It would be hard to categorize this game into one specific genre; if I had to try I would say that Deadly Premonition is an open world thirdâperson murder-mystery survival horror adventure game.To play Deadly Premonition, you need to approach it with an open mind. This is not your typical run-of-the-mill video game. No, instead this game has some of the worst visuals and controls youâll ever encounter, not to mention the new HD remake has some framerate issues as well. But do not let this deter you from the game as absolutely none of that matters when youâre playing it. Deadly Premonition follows Agent Francis York Morgan, an FBI agent investigating the murder of a young woman in the quaint little town called Greenvale. York (As he likes to be called) takes the case due to the mysterious and intriguing M.O of the killer â red seeds are always found near the body of the victims. York has to work together with the denizens of Greenvale to help bring in the bad guy and restore order to the once peaceful town. Sounds like your average detective plot right? Well, it couldnât be further from that. Without getting into too many spoilers, the plot takes numerous twists and turns that send you on a journey of self-discovery and has you second guessing what the truth is.The real hook of Deadly Premonition comes from the charm its characters and environments exude. Everything and everyone is bursting with personality. Agent York for example has a special friend named Zach; what makes Zach so special is that no one else can see him or knows about him besides York, even if he talks to Zach in front of another character. York constantly talks to him in his head throughout the game, and youâre always wondering if Zach is real or just some imaginary friend. York also seems to be very knowledgeable about movies. When driving around in your car York will often talk about various movies with Zach such as the classics Tremors and Goonies. Another example would be the Deputy Sheriff, Emily Wyatt, who bears a striking resemblance to the actor Naomi Watts, for no apparent reason. The town of Greenvale feels very homey and you often feel like youâre in an episode of Everwood. I think Access Games really nailed the look and feel of Greenvale.As mentioned before, Deadly Premonition is an open world game of sorts. The game has a timer for each day and main objectives have to be completed within a certain time frame. The main objectives push the story forward and this is usually where the survival horror aspect comes into play. These sections have you exploring linear levels gunning down hordes of creepy enemies in classic Resident Evil 4 over the shoulder style. While these sections do little to scare you, they are entertaining enough to keep things moving forward. York can use a multitude of weapons ranging from his handgun to breakable melee weapons such as a pipe or spade.You can partake in numerous activities and interact with various NPCs in the game. You could, for example, spy on one of the officers while theyâre having supper in their apartment. I kid you not, you can literally look into their window and stalk them and watch them do completely mundane things like eat or sit on a couch. But that is where the real beauty of Deadly Premonition comes in. It is then up to you to explore and find these gaming gems, and trust me some of them will have you in stitches from laughing so much. There are also numerous side missions that are given to you by certain NPCs; they are not easy to find as some NPCs are only active during certain times of the day â you have to be sure to talk to them at that time or you might miss out. The fact that those NPCs go about their daily lives independent of you, the player, really makes the game feel alive.The game has some catchy tunes and the voice acting is particularly good at capturing each characterâs unique personality. The same canât be said about the sound effects, though. The graphics are really bad. This game looks like it was made in the PS 2 era, even with the updated graphics, but the bad graphics give the game a certain extra charm. If you are open-minded enough I promise you will have a one-of-a-kind experience that you will not soon forget. The PC release though, has its fair share of problems, including poor performance, and a resolution locked at 720p. Itâs a bit of a bad console port, to be honest â though one wonders if this adds to the charm. Never before have I experienced such an awful, weird but utterly amazing game. This game really is so bad, itâs good. Overall 7/10.
815	0	a	Great idea, sub-par execution.  Also, what's with the devs adding 20 and 40 hour playtime 'achievements' to a game that takes 7 hours to complete at most? That's insane considering it has literally zero replayability. You can't even decide how to off people, it's a linear story disguised as a sand-box 'hitman'-esque game.  Perhaps the devil really is in the details?
522	1	a	What's more fun than being the Son of Satan?    Methodically killing everyone that lives in your household starting with the help and working to your family members without anyone suspecting a thing through a series of sometimes difficult puzzles? Absolutely!    Lucius was the first game that I ever purchased for Steam in 2012 and have continued to love the same since then and would highly recommend this classic to those who even just enjoy the gore-factor alone (let's get this straight- GORE from a 2012 game which shouldn't deter the squimish). I have honestly enjoyed playing through this game and watching as my actions create grief amongst the family, sending members into insanity, anxiety, and paranoia as you get away with murder upon murder through fifteen chapters.    My only issue with Lucius is the directional issue of the game itself, sometimes glitching and resulting in a level which is impassable which has happened a few times which I picked up items before the actual time that I needed them- or had no idea what I was doing in the level at all due to minimal direction. Other than that (and some slight issue with controller support) there are not many negatives to Lucius than sometimes rushed story/chapters and a semi-cheesy plot that parallels the Omen. Not to mention how uncanny Lucius' model is on top of the fact that he does not speak ( which is fine since the awesome voicework of the rest of the cast makes up for it compeltely with emotional delieveries of lies! ) and some slight animation lackage ( which I'll give leaniancy to since it is a 2012 game )   All and all, I would definately recommend this game to anyone who has had the hankering to be the murdering Son of Satan!

1878	0	a	No I did not play this for long. I love the graphics, the setting, the kinda feeling. I love hiding in buildings from a scanning airship and drones flying around. I love the weapons, the swapping system, even the liberation and I adore the melee kills.  But then it does some things wrong, the story which I can look past, is dull and to easy to ignore since it doesn't really pull you in. The performance which again I can look past is horrible, The one thing I just couldn't stand, the one thing i couldn't do was the gameplay. The way the game played, it's just such a simple shooter. I was hoping for more depth, cover systems, refined squad tactics. Maybe I play too many simulators but I stopped playing COD for a reason and this game is why.  If you want is a generic shooter to kill time then please by all means get it, but please not for more than $20 it just is not worth more than that.  My performance so you can benchmark yours too mine: I hovered around 40-60FPS, 60 only in silent closed spaces with almost nothing around. While in a intense place I saw my FPS drop to 30's though this was uncommon, it usually averaged at around 40-45FPS.  My Specs for comparison:  Gigabyte R.990FXA-UD5 R5 Mobo HyperX Fury Black 16Gig DDR3 1866Mhz RAM Asus GeForce GTX 1060 ROG STRIX OC 6Gig AMD FX-8370 8-core CPU overclocked to 4.8GHz  I hope this helps someone decide to get it or not. I personally did not enjoy my time. I even uploaded my time with it to YouTube.

If you get to the end o game, theres two ending to pick from; an action ending where you can blast people with your best moves, or a puzzle ending that makes you have to do VERY specific things in order.. Was quite hard doing the puzzle ending, especially since I'm terrible at puzzles lol. But yea just a heads up that the action ending is likely more fun than the puzzle ending I did. Overall pretty fun game, pretty nasty at times though !!

1993	1	a	This Game... where do I start.   Ok. First I can defintley say that doom is down right better than this. BUT, its not to say that this game is bad. It has many issues with optimization and lip syncing. But those as of now is pretty meaningless to me. Hear me out. The story is pretty lacking to say the least. but with enough beer its pretty fun. The gunplay is a bit choppy prob due to the random frame drops (its not my pc, 4770 and 2 Titans in SLI, 1440p 144hz, ussually 60-50 fps, but will drop to 20 sometimes). The gameplay is almost like far cry 3,4 (more like 3 but aspects of 4 is there) and is pretty fun for a run and gun kind of guy. the stealth is down right horrible with the frame drops, and the ai to be trolly at times, is just painful. The customization is awesome, it was the best thing in crysis if you ask me. And the Soundtrack is not that bad, the composer shoud get a raise.  All in all it has its problems, but if this game is ever on sale for $30 maybe $40, its a good pick up.  7/10

1822	0	a	Really wanted this game to be good, I'd of loved to of give a positve review. As I haven't finished this game and don't really intend to I can't speak of the later campain.  Starting off with the first few mission on the game it seemed like it was going to be very story driven introducing you to the characters and making out you were relatively new to this 'freedom fighter' role. After the first few missions are over you're thrown into a massively open world with no real sense of purpose, you'll get your main missions that are accessed through your phone that seem to send you to a new area everytime and then there's a load of side missions that don't seem to progress anything at all and there is no consequence to not doing them.  Then you have the zone capturing to get on with slowly freeing the area from the KPA and if the first zone is anything to go by you might as well not bother because it will get rid of the enemies and well... there's just no point, weapons and equipment all seem tied to the main mission regardless of these zones. Yellow zones play out a little differently as you can pretend you're a civilian in these areas and supposedly blend in with the crowd, yet for some reason every guard instantly recognises you like you're some big shot rebel guy even after only one mission. When you're spotted in these zones you'll get an alert status meaning every guard in the area will start shooting you and actively persue you, so you'll have to hide as endless waves of enemies will spawn until the alert status has passed.  The multiplayer is kind of fun for a bit but I only really got a few hours out of it as it only has like 5 missions, you can get new gear and such from supply boxes which just give you random crap, as far as I can tell you just need to buy weapon packs until you have the weapon you want but it really is pointless because there's a really limited amount of missions to use them on.  Well to sum it up I'm just really dissapointed, I loved the first game as it felt like you were actually helping america fight for freedom in this one it just feels like you're mindlessly following the star shaped objective marker. 0/10
1901	0	a	  Shallow gameplay. Along the lines of FarCry's radio tower missions except there's one every 20ft. Each point is as simple as killing 1-2 guys, then pressing E on a radio. Even on the hardest mode, it's a walk in the park. Gunplay is basic at best. LMGs, Rifles, doesn't matter, they all respond the same; First bullet always fires straight. Should not be sniping with an LMG, but yet here we are.  Great environment, great concept, terrible storytelling, unengaging gameplay.  Note: Even after the promised patch, the game runs terribly. 780ti running everything on medium and still getting dips below 50fps. Don't even try and play it without VSync, it's just non-stop screen tearing.  If Homefront 1 was too linear, Homefront 2 is too open. Swing and a miss.

I made it as far as claiming 100% of the first 2 zones you are given access to, but after falling through the world upon map transition again I've decided to give up and play something less buggy.

2276	0	a	first of all, I don't like to play the bad guys.   The story of the game is so horrible, the USA are importing weapons, with backdoors installed, from Best Korea and then they are wondering how all of this could happend. In the whole time you are playing as a terrorist, sabotaging the KPA(the army of  BEST  Korea), murdering innocent police officers, terrorizing the population and a lot more what terrorist tend to do.  The AI is so stupid, you are in front of a guard with weapons equipped and he won't notice you, oh boy the KPA is really accpeting the American tradition of wearing weapons in public. As a terrorist, of course, you only have limited range of weapons, for example only one handgun is available in the whole game. 
3001	1	a	I don't even know how to properly describe this game or how it found its way deep into the cuckles of my black heart but my god is it a tour de force of pure WTF. If you have a pension for the weird and don't mind a terrible port, buy this â¥â¥â¥â¥!
2613	1	a	It's really hard to rate Deadly Premonition. In one hand it's utterly broken, buggy and sometimes even outdated, but it's also very clever, atmospheric and unique. Basically DP is an open-world investigating taking place in a little town, just like Twin Peaks. But this description just doesn't cut it. It's also extremely bizarre, weird and often creepy. The 'side quests' are also very different from what you're used to, they mostly revolve around getting to know the people of Greenvale, and actually this is how I spent around 3/4 of my almost 40 hour playthrough... just getting to know this town and the people living in it. York (and Zach) the 2 in 1 detective, George the king of the town, Harry the weird millionaire who always wears a mask for some reason... and even though you get to know the characters very well, they still managed to keep the thing that are important well hidden, lurking in the background, just so they can surprise you with it later. The story and the narrative are just perfect. Same could be said for the soundtrack and the voice actors, all top-notch. All in all Deadly Premonition is a terribly broken, ugly (and despite these) amazing game, which I'd wholeheartedly recommend to all my friends :) This is probably as close as we'll ever gonna get to a Twin Peaks game folks!

Communicate. Absolutely loving it! Camp and get overrun. You have to flank and coordinate during the combat. AI flanks. We were doing well hitting their right, then suddenly we are being hit from behind as more KPA enterd our building from a back alley. Bad â¥â¥â¥!

300	1	a	Nice little 3rd person puzzler. 3rd Person point and click gameplay.  It is incredibly buggy though. Sometimes finding items can be a little hard. Most of the powers seem to be useless except in certain contextual areas.  Game looks okay. Fun to play.  I'd get it on sale but I'd get every game on sale. It's definetely unique, so if you are into puzzle games and want something different, buy it. It's better than the sequel.
1828	1	a	Before it start this review i dont see how so many ppl are having issues with this game. Got a steady 57-60 fps the entire game, no lag or crashes. This homefront is a HUGE IMPROVEMEMT from the FIRST HOMEFRONT!! The action in this game will have you smilling from the start to the end. I enjoyed how they made it open world and almost half the building you come across you can enter them.   Pros -takes 8hours to beat (NOT INCLUDING SIDE MISSIONS) -Convert your weapons to a whole new gun -Drive bikes -Animations are done very well -Voice acting is good -Open world/ Graphics are sexy -upgrade your character and weapons -Small shops and stores to buy items -side missions -STORY IS AMAZING -Atmosphere   Cons -Cant get one achievement 'Practical Mayhem' -Once you beat the game you cant go back and roam the map again -Attachments are limited per weapon example: Ar cannot place a silencer but you can place on a rifle or pistol. -Getting away from the KPA is TOO EASY!! -Lip sync is kinda off -Bugged achievements (beating the game, upgrading weapons, killing heavy, etc) EASY FIX JUST VERIFY CACHE START GAME AND END IT AND YOU SHOULD EARN THE ACHIEVEMENTS YOU DIDNT GET IN GAME!

2661	1	a	Well this is the best experience i have ever got from a video game, mixed with some really annoying designer choices. It is absolutely not a game for everyone, but if you can look past the problem on the surface you will find a very interesting and touching story with great characters. Personally, i am not going to forget this game ever.
107	0	a	This is a MOBA. I'm not sure I understood that before I bought it but once I was in a game I realized, oh, this is laning and pushing and knocking down towers. There's a few differences, you take territory rather than simply wrecking enemy towers, and you can spend money to benefit your entire team with team upgrades and tower upgrades, as well as purchasing things for yourself. And you can have an army of your own minions, to either back you up or handle a different objective than your hero. The heroes are all pretty slow and the maps are pretty big so you do spend an enormous amount of time walking back and forth to buy things and heal and return to battle. Not long into any game the heroes get so powerful that if you are absent from a lane for even a moment, an enemy can take out a tower or two, so I find that a high HP and regend build is sort of OP, allowing you to stay in lane and push, even if your DPS isn't very good. Just being present matters more than being powerful. Some characters appear to be suited for certain roles, IE assassins or tanks, but some characters seem a bit strange. The plant lady would seem to be to be suited best with a big minion army, but she can also tank a bit, and has quite a bit of tower damage and creep extermination, leading me to think that the characters aren't very balanced. If that character has one good build but is flexible enough to be effective at literally everything else, I don't think the character's central role is powerful enough to not opt into the other branches of their tree. Though honestly in my experience the games last so long that you max out nearly everything by the time you win. Again, the heroes get pretty strong. You may spend a lot of money upgrading your towers and minions but it may not matter later on. This leads me to think that completely balanced hero upgrades does not mean that the other upgrades in the game are as balanced. The controls aren't quite fluid and there are times when I died because of it, but eventually I simply learned the quirks of the controls and the incomplete physics of bodyblocking to better avoid stupidly dying to inadequate game physics.  In my opinion this isn't nearly as fun as it should be. A MOBA where you effectively play as really huge characters and you take territory, it sounds really good as a recipe, but the result isn't quite as satisfying as the recipe sounds.

1417	1	a	If you like twinstick shooters you should like this, up there with renegade ops.  Worth grabbing with all DLC and its not expensive.
1097	1	a	Remember in Oblivion (Elder Scrolls Series) when you're in the dark brotherhood and you get to kill the house guests? This is a roided up version of that very short quest. But you can't be too blunt or obvious about your kills, no crouching with a sword this time, instead you've got to watch them, learn what they do... and proceed through your plan to ultimately sacrifice them to your 'father'.  Its a great game and I recommend everyone try it at least once.

1812	0	a	I played and thoroughly enjoyed the original Homefront, so I was eagerly anticipating the release of Homefront: The Revolution. In total I've committed about 13 hours to it, and I have completed both the campaign and most of the strikepoints. The length of the game is far shorter than many have claimed, but it still is longer than average for most AAA titles. Whilst I enjoyed what I played, I can't recommend the game until the AI and optimisation are fixed, as these two are critical in holding it back.  A few things worth noting.  Graphics - Although it may be poorly optimised, the game is quite aesthetically pleasing. The environment has quite a lot of detail, and is fairly immersive for an open world game. AI - is broken and needs a full overhaul. The AI suffers from pathfinding issues, and is generally dumb in combat often charging in wrecklessly. Optimisation - Througout my playthrough I had my settings on Ultra (aside from AA) and was playing at a resolution of 2560x1440. Unfortunately the game lacks an SLi profile (attempting to use Nvidia Inspector to force it creates a broad array of graphical issues). Forgettable generic characters

2258	1	a	Needs optimisation, and some keys cant be rebound like X for example which will do what it does by default and what you bind it to do, this for me means costomizing my weapon and crouching at the same time with X which is quite anoying !! Apart from that i am quite enjoying the game
1296	1	a	Awesome game. Works great with controlers.
2940	1	a	Imagine if Twin Peaks was made by a semi-â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Japanese man named Swery and that's essentially what Deadly Premonition is.  I love it and you should too.
1534	1	a	The main complaints about this game are about the optimization.  I have a fairly powerful computer, and it runs fine, albeit i turned a few settings from ultra to high (poor me).  There are occasional lag spikes, once every 10 minutes i'd say, but it's not game breaking at all.  Seeing as I'm not a whiny baby, i realize that optimization is something that will be fixed in a month or two through patches, and if its not, THEN i'd be worried, but until then, we're going to look at the game from a non technological standpoint.  My only complaint so far is that i feel like i was thrown into the action a little too fast. Not enough intro plot for me, but an hour in, i was very comfortable with how the game was going.  Gameplay wise, it's similar to farcry.  Liberate zones to increase your support in the region, disable North Korean infrastructure, and gain the 'hearts and minds' of the people, to bring more people to the revolution. This is done by capturing special objectives and areas, like observation points, patrol areas, securable areas, saving civilians, broadcasting revolution propaganda in place of North korean propoganda, and a few other ways as well. The hearts and minds system is a nice refresher to this style of gameplay.   The combat feels good. You have the choice between stealthing, brute force, or hit and run tactics using tech you aquire in the game.  For example, a remote car explosive device could be driven under an armored patrol vehicle and detonated, destroying it and the soldiers patrolling with it, letting you stay at a safe distance and leave quickly.  The guns feel good, the sounds are nice and even on hardened you can take down norks with a good headshot, or a few body shots.  The most interesting part of this would probably be the weapons customization.  For your first weapon, you are given a pistol and an SMG conversion. To apply this conversion, you remove the slide of the pistol, insert the lower into the SMG upper and load the magazine, all of this being a very nice animation you actually see in game.  You can also switch out AR15 uppers, shotgun parts, and pretty much anything else you want on the fly.  I'll probably update this review once i've completed the game, but so far, i can safely say most of the compaints and negative reviews are based upon the game not being properly optimized for the PC, which is understandable, but not enough to give it a negative review in my opinion.

291	0	a	TL;DR: If you want a buggy satanic open-world-ish puzzle game,this might be the one for you,if it was cheaper.  This game is short and buggy.It didn't feel like a satanic murderer sandbox,like most reviews and curators have said,but rather a game that would belong to the puzzle genere.I,myself,have experienced quite a few (maybe a lot more than just a few) bugs trough my 2 times finishing the story.The one that bothered me the most was journal entries literally not appearing no matter what I done.My ouja board was the only thing that helped me commit the murders.They would all at once pop up only after I killed the person,and of course I had to use a walkthrough at certain points,even if it is not a thing I normally do.The other annoying bug was Lucius getting stuck in the ground in certain points of Dante Manor,making me restart the chapter.Kristen Stewart has MORE facial expressions than the main character,that doesn't really even look like a 6 year old,and this logic really ruined the immersion for me-basically,in that manor of rich and respectable people he was the only main character that dressed in a suit.A 6 year old.Not his dad,not the detective that tries to catch you,not his mom,only his grandfather if I'm not mistaken.The other bugs I was talking about were visible but not always ruining the gameplay,things like models becoming colourless,glitching out,etc.And the only thing I found is to blame were lazy developers,for even grammar is not correct sometimes,usually in the MAIN CUTSCENES.The Dante Manor,the place where the action of the game happens is also pretty repetitive itself,having two mirrored parts,only with different room layouts,giving the big bad house a repetitive feeling,and even despite it's maze like corridors,trust me,that layout is so simple you'll don't need the map anymore from chapter 6 onwards.The hitbox of your final spell 'Combustion' is very rough and not tweaked for individual models,it can only hit the chest I think,nothing will happen if you set someone's hand or foot on fire (so real).The turn-the-crosses-upside-down system is a bit cheesy,or cliche,whatever you want to call it.And if you may want an explanation to my 40 hours of playing it,I left it open,because there is an achievement where you need to play 40 hours,and as the other are really easy,with 3 quarters of them you have completed before you know it,it would be a shame to now make this one a perfect game...hell,even Dark Souls achievements are less annoying than leaving this damn game open 40 hours.

I don't even recommend playing it for free unless you have unlimited bandwidth like me,.. since it's a 40gb download / delete
274	1	a	Lucius is classified as an adventure game, but I feel like it deserves its own genre: Murder simulator. You play as, essentially, the son of the devil and stealthily murder people one by one. It's a twisted concept that is pulled off very well and is surprisingly fun.  Storytelling isn't this game's strong point as it isn't written or acted very well and seems to take a second seat to the gameplay. In a normal adventure game this would be a problem but here, gameplay is the focus. Otherwise it does have a similar structure to other adventure games: picking up various objects from the world, combining them, and discovering ways to use them to accomplish your current goal. Lucius is a third-person 3D game though which is unusual for the genre.  The main drawback of this game is that it can be very difficult to figure out what to do to progress, especially in the later chapters. The mansion is quite large and the game generally only gives you vague clues about where to go and rarely what you actually need to do there. You end up with a lot of useless items in your inventory which confuse things even further.  For the technical aspect, the graphics aren't very good and it requires a surprising amount of power to render them. Loading times are surprisingly long for the graphical quality but not long enough to make the game annoying to play. The engine also has a constant persistent stutter like the Gamebryo engine that seems to be impossible to get rid of.  If I had to sum up Lucius in two words, I'd say 'delightfully twisted.' It's great fun despite the technical issues and poor writing.
1645	1	a	It's 'ok'...  ... I guess.
780	1	a	The graphics are ok. The plot it's pretty nice. It's cool that you have to do bad things and kill people to be more powerfull. The SFX and BG Music are good. The movements are kinda weird... Lucius looks like he is walking on a slippery floor

1744	0	a	its a fun game but if you want the story just go watch someone play it on twitch or youtube. has almost nothing to do with the original Homefront witch people also thought didnt have a great story, somehow they managed to make the story evan worse. and all of that is just the start when you realize this has no multiplayer. sure it has resistance mode or whatever the â¥â¥â¥â¥ that is but it dosent have a VS style multiplayer no Tdm ,no capture the flag ,no conquest, not like the original homefront witch had an amazing multiplayer, i recomend people use this as an example and decide to use the money the would have spent on this lacking game to go buy the first homefront for themselves and a few of there friends so the multiplayer servers can be populated again. Overall dont buy this game
575	1	a	I'd say the movie 'The Omen' was an inspiration for this game. You are the son of the devil and yur goal is to be a little â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Killing staff members in your giant mansion while 'Daddy Lucifer' occasionally visits to give you new gifts. Like a ouija board that hints at what you are supposed to do to kill your target for the chapter you are in. So far there have been some grizzly deaths and it has been entertaining to play and well designed. The only complaints I have is the acting is terrible, there are times where you just don't know what to do, and the AI could be much better. People walking into closed doors, and repeating themselves multiple times because they are only programed to say one line per level. But all in all, I would say it is worth the buy.

457	1	a	Positive surprice. I never thought that indie game inspired by 'The Omen' movies would make a good experience. Despite of the simple plot and gameplay this game succeeded to keep me playing it through without any larger pauses. The most unique thing in Lucius is damn well created cut-scenes. Especially those with murder were so stunning that they gave me cold chills. Good mixture of point&amp;click- and 'Hitman' -games, provides decent entertaiment for few hours. Play or Lucifer will have your soul!..kidding ^^ (Suomessa tehty)

2952	1	a	This game legitimately manages to be both the best and the worst experience I've had playing a game.  By default it's locked at 30 FPS and 720p, while crashing constantly. Installing a fix for this doesn't actually fix the framerate issue causing it to change periodically AND change the game speed with it, as well as cause it to crash MORE. It's a knock off of Twin Peaks despite SWERY claiming to have never heard of it It's never getting an actual sequel due to the fact that SWERY has stopped making games to be a buddhist monk (Look it up I'm not â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥tting you) The gameplay itself is unbearably boring  That said the wack-â¥â¥â¥ story and crazy characters/writing have elevated it to being one of the most memorable and fun experience I've had in a long time.  It's like $2.50 on sale the fact that only 2 people I know have it (One of which I gave it to) is a shame on all of you.

333	1	a	First off, let me start with who I am. I'm a rare bird in the gaming world being a middle aged female with a career and the usual middle age responsibilities. This lends me to games which don't require hours of controller practice, though there is the occassional first person shooter I enjoy, eg, Red Dead Redemption.   Lucius is an adventure game of the Myst genre with well integrated puzzles to solve but no real controller work. The puzzles are a bit too easy. I didn't have to look for a Lucius wiki. I'd give the storytelling a B+. It's a decent game to play on a slow weekend. It won't take much longer. The steam price is appropriate for this game. Worth playing but I wouldn't have been happy with it if I bought it at it's original retail price, just not much depth.
572	1	a	For who like to play adventure games with a mix of psycho killing horror then this a game for you! Regardless of the non high graphics you have a good story line. You need to preform a variety of kills, collect items and combine some, set death traps and much more.

I've used 'disgustingly average' to describe it before. Yet, I can't recommend it enough. Its basically Twin Peaks the game, in a sense.   If you like horror, or action, or story, this is a game for you. The game has many flaws. The driving sucks, the combat could be a little better, the squirrels make MONKEY noises. But, those make Deadly Premonition what it is.   This game is basically the definition of 'So bad it's good'

996	1	a	On 6/6/66, in ward 666, a boy named Lucius is born. Six years later, Dante Manor, his home, is shaken by a series of gruesome murders. No-one knows what to think. Has the house been cursed? Take control of Lucius - akin to the Antichrist - and his satanic powers to wreak havoc. This game is not for the faint hearted, there are a lot of gory scenes and a few sexual ones. Villain protagonists are always fun, and this game is no exception. There are some truly messed-up deaths here. This game contains aspects of stealth and puzzle, as you try to figure out how to pull off your next demonic act, without arousing the suspicions of anyone else. The one major letdown is the considerable lack of information. You have very little idea what to do, and this can prove rather difficult in such a big house with so many tiny details. I also experience a few bugs and occasional crashes, but it does not impact gameplay too much. Apart from that, the gameplay experience is rather pleasing. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the supernatural, stealth, puzzles, or just plain murder. Enter if you dare...
917	1	a	Lucius is a point and click story that takes place at the sprawling mass that is Dante Manor. Reminiscent of everyone's favourite little demon seed, Omen, you've got a lot of work to do for your infernal majesty. Dante Manor is a large place, especially for a young lad like Lucius. With a plethora of corridors and rooms, it can sometimes be confusing (it was for me, for many chapters until I learned it like the back of my hand) to get around. Thus, becoming lost within its many chambers and lobbies.  Your objective; reap souls for your true father. Sounds easy enough, right? Each specific kill requires you to carry out specific actions with certain items and sequences which can sometimes leave you scratching your head as you go delving into every room within the Manor looking for the one thing you need. Despite this, every kill is well thought out and creative, making your toiling worth the while when you see your victims eviscerated.  The atmosphere within Dante Manor is somewhat of a two-faced creature. On one hand, during the day, you have the grandeur of the estate. Accentuated by its gothic trimmings in the form of the sound track and formality. It seems calm - as if all is well. Contrast that to the way it carries itself at night. The despair drenched piano pieces, bleak ambience and the all too pervasive echoing of footsteps and doors being used really inflames the urgency to remain undetected or even be swallowed up by the Manor itself.  The only thing I can really discredit Lucius for is its few glitches that will require you to do no more than restart a chapter, I.E. being swallowed up by the Manor's walls or an NPC misbehaving. Overall, a great game that'll have you scratching your head on occasion and will even have you laughing if you have a taste for the macabre, accompanied by a fitting soundtrack. I'd definitely kill again.
2069	1	a	In my opinion this game is awesome.The graphics and the gameplay are great.The storyline is ok too.One thing I don't like is that your character can not talk.
2054	1	a	Good game. Granted the plot line isn't all that and there are a fairly limiyed number a guns, but there are a ton of side missions to play through. If you want a PLOT RICH revolution game, DON'T get it. If you just wants to shoot some Norht Koreans and blow stuff up, DEFINITLY GO FOR IT.

1460	0	a	If you have liked any of the 'ticky boxing' game play seen in gaming in the past few years from assassins creed to batmans arkham to far cry then you'll enjoy this (which i did but the fun quickly wore thin very quickly).  The games objectives become very repetitive only after a few hours of gameplay like turning on a dozen hard to reach radios or liberating an outpost or turn on this tower through the most easy hacking mini game you wonder why its even there.   The hit and run tactics the game encourages you to use are null since even on the hardest difficulty enemies are easily defeated. Even the 'Sponge' enemies are only there to soak up bullets and cause just bit more damage.  Even though you cant use enemy weapons, enemy soldiers were kind enough to stock up on bullets for my guns when i eventually loot their corpses.  However, what you might hear in other reviews is that the atmosphere of the game is great, really gives you a sense of dread and despair but that soon washes away from the awkward voice acting and pitiful resistance enemy soldiers put up.  The game at times looks great especially when its raining during the night, it does look amazing but there often texture glitches and pop in effects with draw distance.   The on the fly weapon customisation is really cool but soon you find is surprisingly limited and you'll quickly being to rely on two weapons outside of the fun and gimmicky ones such as the shotgun that fires napalm or the 'freedom launcher'.  All and all an average game that isnât crap but not spectacular either.  I only wish there was more to the game except go hear find x amount of things to unlock more things ad nauseam
1493	0	a	  Played this over the weekend both co-op and singleplayer and it's just... eugh, I know we have to give concessions to open-world nature but, it quickly just felt like &lt;Insert Ubisoft Open world title here&gt;   Goto location, kill the guards, press button, suddenly these resistance members move in, if there's any AI enemies nearby they'll be as shocked as you are that these people arrive (Had a hilarious moment when a drone flew upto a man with a rocket launcher on his back, scanned him as clear, flew away and then everyone started shooting)  It has some fun ideas but it's not well implemented or introduced (Which is a shame) the stealth feels hit and miss with enemies seeing you through walls and not seeming to be alerted when the guy next to them suddenly falls over dead.  I won't bother too much with the story because it just fell flat on it's face with this Apex corporation trope (If anyone who did finish the story, please tell me it didn't involve norks time travelling with technology, cause if it did I'll cry) Unlikable characters, no clear reason why the North Koreans are such bad people just 'Merica can't be tamed y'all  The co-op is the only bit I had quite a jolly time with, although it was mainly laughing at the game, as tanks appeared infront of us, the gear unlocking limiting the missions somewhat, some objectives not unlocking.   All in all, it's a fine example of what development hell does to a game, plenty of good ideas poorly integrated, also I smell crytek all over that retconned story.

356	0	a	I went into this hearing all positive reviews on gamesites, raving videos about it &amp; thought it would be good. It started off &amp; was decent, third person sandbox game in a limited environment, a focus on solving puzzles &amp; murder, playing as son of the devil. Oh how I was wrong.  After the first 2 or so murders though all novelty started to run thin, a character would say something in passing to satan-child, devil tells you to get souls, proceed to go through specific path to kill the person. On the way you can do various chores with your powers, pick up blocks with telekinesis, steal underwear from a maids room to wash it etc.   Graphics were decent, better than I expected but not amazing. The story was interesting to start but became boring fast, not as fast as the story decayed though. I won't spoil but by the end it just decided to wrap things up too rushed &amp; uninterestingly, while hinting at a sequel I hope won't come. About half way through it just became a chore to play, there's no way I'm even going to bother with the achievements I haven't got.  Although I hate comparisons, some people like them so here we go. With the (very) limited sandbox &amp; single choice murders, you could mistake it for a portable version of Assassins Creed. Happy? No, nor am I as that was a bad comparison but the game made me unhappy I bothered with it, so get used to the disappointment if you're going to buy it.   Cons:  -Limited interactivity with game world -Poor controls -Poor story -Bland gameplay -Too scripted (might just be me, prefer choices &amp; options in a game like this) -Over the top murders, we're talking the sort little Timmy dreams up only to find his mum being called in by the teacher to send him to psychiatric help, all the while imagining all the ways they could both meet a gruesome fate -Bad ending -No replay value at all, unless you want achievements -Nudity used 50% through to try &amp; entice the player -Everything else in the game -The price, $20 is WAY too much for it, I'd even say the $5 I paid for a bundle with it was too much. If you see it at $2, grab it &amp; be numbed for 5 hours  Pros -Graphics ok for indie game -Powers were cool, not enough to do with them -Good concept  So the tl;dr, interesting concept, really poor execution. If you're swayed by nudity, you can peek on a maid, if you want a decent game then go elsewhere. Maybe if you're 10-16 this will be good, otherwise it's too...forced feeling.
1557	0	a	Optimization is awful. My PC is certainly not low end and even with this rig I get 20 FPS at best. The controls are fidgety, like 2006 basic controls. You turn your vision even slightly and the whole world becomes a blur. I can not, and will not recommend this game. It is not passable for a title developed by a studio in 2016. It's incomplete and should not have been released yet. Â£39.99 gone to waste.
2927	1	a	A weird but gripping third-person action thriller. If you're willing to overlook the technical flaws, awkward design and terrible port job, this is a true gem waiting to be found.

2895	1	a	This game is almost broken on steam so if you decide to get it you will have to patch the hell out of it. To get this game to work you have to make it run in compatability mode for windows 98.  When you get this game to work though it looks like â¥â¥â¥â¥ and plays like garbage. But this is the best awful game you will ever play. While the graphics and the gameplay are terrible the dialog and the story is great. The game has a large variety of weird and interesting characters which makes this game so unique. But I won't lie its tideous baring with the gameplay parts inbetween the dialog and other goodness. The driving is absolutely crazy but you have so many buttons for a bunch of functions on your car.  This has to be my favorite awful game and one of my favorite games.
2832	1	a	I went open minded to this and i must say...I freaking love it so much! I rarely judge a game based on its bugs or crashes, I mostly care about the gameplay and the story, the gameplay is alright, reminds me of a mix between Resident Evil 4 and Silent Hill, and the story so far is amazing! The humor is awesome, the characters are original and really know how to make you love them, specially the main character...Ahhh York! &lt;3 The soundtrack altough repetitive is pretty cool sometimes, specially the whistling one, i whistled along everytime!  In general, if you ignore the sometimes annoying random crashes and the bugs, and you love a good mistery/horror/open world game, this game is perfect for you!  8.5/10 so far! :)

529	1	a	Third-person 3D real time adventure game where you're a satanic psycho killer little kid with satanic powers who goes around killing people. The missions are all 'kill the next person' sort of tasks, so far. There's a stealth aspect to the game. The game seems to be rather demanding 3D hardware-wise as my nvidia 770M (equivalent to a 660 desktop card, basically) runs rather slow on default settings (1920x1080 high detail). Lowering the detail level to medium helps a good bit.  Looks nice, but this sort of game isn't really my thing. I'm marking it 'recommended' anyway just because I like the general idea of a game where you get to be a satanic little psycho killer kid who goes around breaking things and rigging stuff to kill people. (Oops, accidentally dropped the hairdryer in the tub.) But the game mechanics are still rather limited.  I got this game cheap in a bundle.

944	0	a	I looked at this game for a long time when it finally got on sale. So I went and bought it. My little brother warned me against getting this game. He said it was bad. I ignored him. I owe him an apology. He told me the controls were hard to work with and the plot was stupid. Lo and behold, the controls were hard to work with. Not at all helped by how the framerate likes to bounce up and down like a hyperactive child in a bouncy castle going through a sugar high. As for the plot and story , I don't know what to telI you on that front because I was too busy having a wrestling match with the controls to find out what the story was.  I was so unsatisfied I requested a refund, which I normally never do to a game that is on sale. I am really disappointed in this game and myself for buying it.  Just go watch one of those 'demonic child movies' I heard about. I'm sure you'll get the same experience.

2192	1	a	Been playing since the release. Being in the American service I like killing the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s who took over the country I love. It's beautiful, and it's finally a large scale first person that doesnt seem 'filtered'. The gun customization is pretty gosh darn creative, and the scale of AI warfare is great, flipping amazing for the graphics (which is eye candy) The only issue I have, is how dumb the AI are. They are plentiful which is good but they also get in the way. Like, a lot. Friendlies blocking doors and never ending hoardes of badies (and friendlies) coming out of the wood work looking to make a kill. The game is a challenge (the good kind, enimies main style of attack is like previous asian style warfare, aka numbers for strength). A huge step up in the face of the previous Homefront and a total screw you in the face of the dreaded moster Ubisoft. This is a GOOD game. Just take it with a pinch of salt. I hope to see some fixes, maybe smarter AI?
3025	1	a	Nifflas very well could very well title this 'Yet Another Knytt Game' and I would have still bought it and would have still loved it. The game is comprised of Three chapters, the first two are 30-45 minutes each and will leave you worried the game is going to be 2 hours long. Fear not. Chapter Three offers the vast Kyntt exploration we know and love.  That is to say, Kyntt is a Metroidvania exploration game without the normal character progression you'd normally see holding you back. Instead there are a number of clever puzzles that are challenging but shouldn't leave you frustrated (in my experience so far at least). Instead the game reigns you in through, first and foremost, a vast world that forces you to explore your local area or you'll miss much of the beauty of the game, but at the same time makes it extremely clear that you've reached a deadend on the map so you're not left wondering if you can make a jump or not.   The second way it gives you a sense of progression comes by letting you try things. In some instances it explicitly warns you not to until you know more about this or that and if you ignore the warning chances are you're going to fail unless you already know what you're doing. It's a nice way of developing the story and mechanics for first time players without forcing repeat players through lengthy tutorials.  That's the kind of game creator Nifflas is. â¥â¥â¥â¥ing amazing.  (Also, he's make a lot of other games with Knytt and Ball. Go play them. They're free.)

2215	1	a	OK im just gonna get right down to it   The story is rather clichÃ© but the gameplay is actually quite good i mean yes you have that generic open world thing of reach these locations and hack this thing to open up the map a bit and see where everything is.  The weapons and gear customization is very good lots of options and i particularly like the Crysis style attachment menu.  i definitely recommend this game for those just looking for a couple hours of shooting and then be done with it, That's my review of this game but the stuff below is more of a request/me begging  HOWEVER the best thing BY FAR in this game is the part where you are in the restricted zone and you can find an Arcade Machine .. which can i just say needs to happen full scale.. as in bring those games onto the pc as a port PLEASE that NEEDS to happen.  what i mean by that last statement is this    Timesplitters 2 is in the arcade machine with full mouse and keyboard support and 2 levels and so i want to urge the developers to bring all the Timesplitters series onto the pc     i don't care how .. it just needs to happen.
1647	1	a	  Homefront: the Revolution, not a perfect game by any means. Having said that, I don't understand why there is so much hate on this game. I realize it had a terrible launch, however it does seem like they've fixed most of the bugs. It only crashed on me once near the beginning which caused me to have to replay about 5 minutes. Other than that, a few graphic bugs mostly but nothing gamebreaking. My specs are   i7-6700, gtx 960, 16gb RAM   and I had about 45-60 fps on all high settings. The AI is pretty bad but not gamebreaking, at least not for me. The story was pretty basic, nothing special but it did it's job. I managed to finish the story during the free weekend so I didn't actually buy it. However on it's 40% off sale (or if you can get it even cheaper) I would say it's worth it, not at full price though.     Overall Rating
246	0	a	2/10
2485	1	a	I have not played this through, but what i did play, it was genuinely interesting, what the creators were trying to do and did have an element of charm to it.. though this Game is more time consuming than Baldur's Gate, it must be said. I have played this for about 10 hours so far ( and will play more eventually).  Some people will look to this game because it looks like Diablo. Some because of perhaps Baldurs' Gate, in honesty, it is quite disssimilar to diablo, being quite a slow paced game but does share quite a bit in common with Baldurs' Gate, including the intricate detail and the more strategy based combat system; Diablo being a 'hack and slash' allows the character to attack when you click, this does not, and 'commands' the character to attack, making this less of an action game.  Maybe I approached it with too much intertest in the story; and there is Tonnes there, so many people to talk to... some say same thing, like many NPCs in RPGs, but the thing with Baldurs gate with the allignment and need to do things right is here and appears to be quite deep in the chatting system (which again is like Baldurs Gate).  My conclusion for now is this has the makings of being a great game, you,. there are hours(and hours) of material and feels like a decent attempt at a story lead game. Though I think the game could have better done with a more action side too, like diablo and perhaps either the layout been more linear or the world smaller as complication can seem to alienate people, inlcuding me when I have to work; In saying that it is truely great to see something that is different and someone actually trying, and succeding in making something good and diffferent.

994	1	a	Whats not to like about playing the bad guy? This little gem of a game is devilishly fun and brutal. For a game made in 2012, the graphics are really good, in my opinion, and the game is very well polished. Some of the kills are really nasty to watch, for example the Butcher. If you are Christian or do not like things with references to the Devil and Satanic symbols, DONT PLAY THIS GAME, but if you dont really care, give it a whirl!
261	1	a	Admittedly, most people won't enjoy this game. Games have changed and advanced, many scores are based on replayabilty, the scope of the enviroments, and freedom of variation in how to go about things. That's all superb standards to go by today, in open world/sandbox games. However, there is something to be said about restriction in games. With freedom of choice can also come a certain stress, and a sense of incompletion. There's the time and place for both, naturally, but some times there is something soothing and satisfying about playing a game the only way it's meant to be played.  'Lucius' is about exploring your surroundings and figuring out how the puzzles are solved. Sometimes the solution is far fetched, sometimes ridiculous. But all in all, there's some sort of logic there. I enjoyed this game far more than I probably should have. I liked it's simplicity, the house and garden, the idea of it all. Granted, there was much more potential behind the concept that was left unrealised, but for what it was, I enjoyed it.   Shiver Games tried to respond to peoples objections and critique to this first game somewhat in the sequel, which I can't speak of as I haven't played it, but, it did seem like that game have fallen apart in them trying to do so. It was probably more somewhat what they wanted the first 'Lucius' to be; being able to have access to a variety of tools to make death traps, lethal situations and weapons to off any number of roaming NPCs at any given point. From what I've read and seen though those ambitions resulted in a broken game with great potential. The more complex, the more wrong things can go.  'Lucius' has its fair share of bugs and limitations. But it also has a great idea behind it, and for me personally, finally getting the kill I was going for was surprisingly satisfying, as was achieveing 'good boy' status by doing mundane chores around the house. My guess is, if you get some self therapy by say, doing the dishes or painting the fence, you might enjoy this game. Get it on sale though.
907	1	a	Funny and worth the price.
684	1	a	Very entertaining game!  Visuals are very decent: 6.5/10  Music is great: 10/10  Story is all right: 9/10 (if you like horror/mystery genre) Voice acting is good: 7/10 The animations and the cutscenes is where this game falls short: 3/10 (bad lip syncing, awkward hand gesticulations and head bobbing, unpolished facial expressions: all these make this game a parody, not a horror)  Gameplay is solid, I didn't encounter any bugs. This is basically a puzzle game when you're looking for ways to eliminate people by making it seem like an accident. The gameplay is very linear, you have only one way to make it right. I can't rate it, this kind of games is not my usual cup of tea.  Overall I enjoyed the game, but mainly for its story aspect, we had quite a few laughs with my girlfriend while watching the cut-scenes or observing interactions between NPCs.  There is very little replay value though, once you completed the story and know how to solve the puzzles.  My personal score: 6/10. Recomended if on sale under $10.

2267	1	a	Most of the early comments being so negative were unjustified, dont know what happened there. There have been ALOT of games that came out in a much worse state that didnt receive this kind of flak.  That being said, it does need some polish, there are technical imperfections and all that.  But they havent really bothered me in the slightest, im actually enjoying the open world vibe alot ! The shooting is nice, it looks great, the vibe of revolution is there and i just like how the kpa guys look and their high tech stuff feels like a threat.  UPDATE: the patch adresses non issues for me, i notice the slight stutter but i only experience them at the shops. I would much rather see some stronghold fixes, two of them are bugged out in my game and cannot be captured.  The AI issues people have spammed the discussion boards with are out of proportion, yes, there is silly behaviour... propaganda trucks trying to drive up a trashpile into a wall etc, but in al honesty i have not seen this alot. Maybe it doesnt catch my attention like it did in fallout 3 and 4.  Also, i am enjoying this game quite alot, the score it received is absolute nonsense. It should be around 75 imo (still not finished with it). Theres alot more to do and atmosphere than most triple A shooters, it even runs WAY (WAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYY) better for me on high/highest settings than far cry 4 which i had to run on medium settings to be able to shoot something.

Sure its not perfect and there are a few bugs, but nothing that crashed or stopped me from having fun with the game. I'm not bothered by the overzelous nature of the story line because this is an alternate reality. Yes there is alot to be desired, but homefront offers a freedom fighter open world that lets you recruit soliders, capture bases, customize guns and Fight for survival and gives you the excitment of planning out your attack.  I really hope the developer sticks to their word and keeps patching and expanding on the world of homefront in this style, because you can consider me a fan.

2707	1	a	Let me begin by pointing out that this is a terrible PC port. One of the worst I've seen for sure. That said, I was able to comfortably play the game to completion using a mod called DPfix. Not only did this make the game playable, but it also allowed the game to run at a very stable framerate and added support for multiple resolutions. This is important to note because the only other version of this game's Director's Cut available here in the West, namely the PS3 port, suffers from abyssmal performance. With this in mind, the PC version of Deadly Premonition is somehow both the best and worst version of the game. On a personal note, I find this a bit poetic because it perfectly reflects the spirit of the game.  TL;DR The PC port is crap but there's an easy fix that allows for better performance than its console counterparts. For that reason, I can't help but recommend this version over the others.   With that introduction out of the way, let's talk about Deadly Premonition. In short, it's every bit as good, bad, and weird as you've heard. It's an anomoly of a game that really makes you question everything you think you know about what makes a game 'good' or 'bad.' It's completely lacking in polish, yet is so striking in its presentation that it's almost impossible to take your eyes off of it. It casts the broadest net possible over as many genres as it can cover, yet consistently fails to function fully as any one of them independently. It's the only game where you can drive a sports car on two wheels, at 80 miles per hour, to the home of a reclusive gas-mask wearing paraplegic who speaks only in rhyme through his manservant, as weird trance techno blares over the radio, all while your character has a conversation with his imaginary friend about the death of Joey Ramone.  There's nothing I can say that will adequately convey the experience of playing Deadly Premonition, so I won't try any further than I already have. Play it and see for yourself.

2663	1	a	I came in to this game with a lot of doubts, following the comments around the web concerning poor graphics and gameplay mechanics and random crashes. I learned about it when I saw an article about Durante (The guy who fixed Dark Souls on the PC), so when I learned that he was working to fix things, I bought the game right out.  After 20 + hours in game, I can say this is one of the best games I ever played. Sure it has problems, but the excellent script and crazy story, overcome those limitations.  You can make it better in the graphics departement by installing DPfix and SweetFX.  It finally comes down to taste. You will either love this game or hate it. I just love it. :)

1044	1	a	THIS DOES CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS, BUT IT IS MUCH EASIER TO MAKE EVERYTHING A SPOILER!    Lucius is an outstanding game where you play as a 6 year old boy born on 6-6-1966. Somehow he is the son of Lucifer and notices him as his father, and thus he gains his demonic powers, which you will use to murder, and aid in sucicide, many people. Including your own parents! While you murder the people that goes along with the game story line, police, detectives, and everybody else will start to take cauction in the house. SO BE CAREFUL, and try not to get caught, This may be the only frustrating part of the game. So I would suggest a guide to help get items early to save time later, and so you can understand your main objective. Also enjoy this marvelous game.    95.5/100 bananas :D

The sequel oh wow so much wasted potential, first off if you were hoping to pick up at the end of Homefront nope ignores it completely.  Combat wise well it's an fps you point you shoot enemies die. It does not have deep mechanics but it does have a pretty good weapon customization design. You can basically turn any of the 6/7 main types of gun into three other weapons for example the pistol can be converted to an SMG and to a silcenced single shot pistol etc.  The AI is pretty basic playing on Normal difficulty they seem to run straight at you or just past you in an attempt to get to cover, though it is fairly easy to get overwhelmed in the more combat intensive red zones.  The main story campaign is okay not as interesting as the first homefront story at least to me, the open world sections feel like massive padding you do the same two or three types of side mission 6/7 times you free a zone and then you move onto the next one for a total of 12 zones I am currently slogging my way through zone 6 i think at this point I doubt I will finish it.   Bottom line if you want to give it a try wait for a steam sale, or a free weekend because i have a feeling the way multi player is dropping off a free event cannot be too far behind.
269	1	a	If Hitman had a son that son was the Anti-Christ, that son whould be Lucius. Luicius is a strange yet original game: it mix the old point and click with a small 3D open world. Your quest is to kill everyone in the house, 'cause you need human sacriface for your daddy, some guy who work in the 'underground'. If you want to be a hero, and not a villian, this is not the game for you.  The story isn't bad at all, its actually pretty nice. Sure, it takes some forced ways into the story, and you clearly see them, but they won't bother you much. At least, it didn't bother me, it actually made the game much more interesting.  The ending isn't also bad, but it left me with a feel of uncompletionist. Probably was too fast.  The gameplay works fine: you have to collect items around the house to complete goals to kill people and make the homicides looks like accidents. Sadly the difficulty goes to insanely hard that 'I don't even know what to do' to 'this is so easy that even a 6 years old kid whould do that'. Did I mention you're a 6 years old kid?  The music it's pretty fitting, but it gets repetive real soon. And expecially sometimes it bugs out, like it disappear or change theme out of nowhere and you don't know what's goin on, even tho' nothing is goin on.  The graphic its 'meh': there ain't no good facial expression, and the lip sinc its all broken, but for some reason, the ambiance looks awesome, and the gore works fine.  It seems the creator couldn't put in some good face flexes.  I've encounter some bugs and glitch along the game, and sometimes they made me restart the mission. For exemple, I opened the journal during a cutscene, and the game freeze. Couldn't move. Or in a cutscene, I was riding the tricicle before that happened, and Lucius was flying around.

Maybe 20â¬ can be a little too much for it, I suggest to get it around 5â¬ like I did.
2601	1	a	 This game is truly one-of-a-kind and one of the few games I would encourage everyone to play.   I will get this out of the way first - this game is a horrible PC port. It can require a lot of messing around to even get it to run, and if you want it to run higher than 720p then you will have to install mods to achieve that. I would personally experience drops in frame-rate followed by the game crashing approximately every 2 hours on my setup but your problems may vary! (The directorâs cut does have some pro's compared to the original even though it is a bad port - the controls are improved and the combat is easier - in a good way)  It's a testament to the compelling nature and uniqueness of this game that I would gladly put up with such an experience.  You play as FBI Agent Francis York Morgan who is called to a remote town called Greenvale to investigate a murder of a young woman - and it doesn't take long to become clear that there is something very strange indeed going on. The game has been compared a lot to the TV Show 'Twin Peaks' and it is a clear influence - for anyone unfamiliar with the show, it combines mystery with quirky characters and absurd happenings and this game is no different.  It is full of weird, clichÃ© (in comedic fashion) and intriguing people - everyone has their own odd quips and interactions that make the game interesting and fun. It can be confusing at first as you try to decide if the game you are playing and the dialogue you are hearing is serious or not - but soon you will lose yourself in the combination of mystery and absurdity and want to experience all that Greenvale has to offer.  The game is all about the experience and storyline - you will drive around town and engage in combat throughout much of the game - neither of them are anything special. They are both very archaic and along with the graphics are not what you would expect in a relatively modern game. For my experience though I never had any particular  problem  with either of them, they are just not what make the game enjoyable. However, although the driving itself isn't great, there is something very pleasureable about travelling around the town and engaging in your day to day tasks like going to lunch with your police colleagues or going to a bar in the evenings to play darts and talk with the townsfolk.  It is the mad characters, the crazy music, the twists, the absurd and even genuinely touching moments that shine in this game and keep you coming back. I have never really ever experienced a game quite like it and (although I would love one) I will perhaps not play another like it again.  A very unique game - one with plenty of flaws but also so much to love. I would recommend all people with an interest in story-driven games to try it out.

2737	1	a	Never played it on the XBOX so I have no say on the port. It is pretty bad though. THAT BEING SAID. This game is perfect in every way, right Zach?
1305	1	a	So I got this game because I got a coupon for 50% off and thought why the hell not. It's been a pretty fun game so far but I have to say the gameplay is not that versatile. The missions u have to do are pretty much the same the entire time. You either have to pick up some survivors or destroy some zombie nest. And at times it feels more like your just focussing on collecting health and ammunition for most parts of the mission. The game on the other hand reminds me a bit of the very first GTA, and who doesnt like a bit of nostalgia.

2177	0	a	This is by far the worst shooter of 2016, and easily one of the worst shooters I've ever played. Right off the bat, I knew something was horribly, TERRIBLY wrong with this game. But, I guess that's just what I get for thinking that the sequel to the most mediocre game in history was actually going to be worth a damn.  For starters, the enemy AI is stupid beyond reason. Most of the time playing had them running into walls, shooting in the wrong direction, clipping through objects, or shooting one way while the bullets go another. I haven't seen AI this bad since RIde to Hell: Retribution. Frankly, though, this isn't much better than RTH, anyway.  The writing is some of the most incompetent â¥â¥â¥â¥ I've ever witnessed. Every line of dialogue was cringe-worthy, every character a shell, every NPC an idiot. I thought Halo 5 had writing, but this is straight up incompetent on every level. The mission design is lazy, simple Point A - Point B run and gun shooting, taking buildings, 'talking' to NPC's, and after you claim a new stronghold, it immediately is decked out with American flags and sprawling with rebels. It's so jarring that I actually thought I was teleported to a different area of the map on several occassions. On one occassion, I had to take a stronghold with a Korean tank inside. The tank, out of nowhere, exploded, without any warning or reason whatsoever.  Kill me now. Please, put me out of my misery!  The multiplayer is an absolute joke. A series of co-op missions (of which encompass and grand total of TWO GAME MODES!) have you do the same exact things you were already doing in the campaign. The absurd nature of the plot does nothing to assist in the game's setting, the player customisation is an absolute joke, your body clips through objects incessantly, friendly NPC's clip through objects even more, and the freezes and stuttering in this game is ABYSMAL. I can run just about every modern game on Ultra and still pull off 45+ FPS (depending on how demanding the game is), so it's absolutely unnacceptable that this game, on MEDIUM SETTINGS, still freezes constantly. Movement is jerky and awkward, the gunplay is hit or miss, and half of the objectives in the game don't even work!  Seriously, no joke, at the beginning of the game, you have to set off a trap that includes explosive barrels. You have to simply press a button to detach the barrels and have them fall on the North Koreans and blow them up. One of the barrels (I couldn't make this â¥â¥â¥â¥ up if I tried) actually got stuck, and it blew me up instead.  This is the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing travesty of a game that this abortion of a company delivered.  I don't know why it happened, but Crytek apparently sold the rights to this game to some other developer I've never heard of, and it's clear that they have NO CLUE how to make a game. Do not play this. Do not rent it, do not purchase it, do not borrow it. It is the worst FPS I've played in years. This makes the last Homefront game look like a masterpiece. I actually enjoyed Major\Minor, the dumbest game of all time, more than this game. Refund it if you were suckered into buying it.  â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game.

1378	1	a	 Bottom line:  An enjoyable and attractive, if somewhat frustrating, top-down driving game in the vein of the original GTA games. Has less complex missions, however spices things up with seriously large hordes of zombies to brutalise with heavy weapons!   Pros:    Video and audio are generally pleasing. The maps and vehicles have a lot of gritty detail and weather and lighting effects are put to good use. The particle and gore effects are suitably over-the-top and make firing rockets into zombie mobs a very satisfying experience.   Multiple game modes provide a great amount of content for the price and also offer a variety of experiences. This is a good thing, because the story missions generally feel much the same. In particular, I found the Slaughter mode (arena) to be challenging and required both tactical and strategic thinking to reach round 20 and beyond. Racing includes a variety of different events, in which the aim is either racing, destroying opponents, or driving as far as possible with a bomb attached to your car! Sadly, I found all modes spoiled more often that not by the difficulty in identifying 'hard' obstacles and the unpredictable handling of the vehicles during collisions.   Weapon variety is decent and effective, but fairly uninspired. Power-ups are all incremental improvements until the last level, where power is doubled. Specialisation usually plays second fiddle to whatever happens to be lying around your general vicinity at the time.   No crashes in the ten or so hours spent in game (Windows 8).    Cons:    Unpredictable behaviour when hitting walls and other obstructions; sometimes you bounce, sometimes you stop dead, sometimes you instantly spin 180 degrees. A little frustrating in the main game, immensely frustrating in the race events! Came close to rage quitting a few times in this mode... Apart from this, the controls are fine (used M&amp;KB).   What 'story' there is remains utterly predictable throughout and voice acting is excruciating. I am sure its tongue in cheek, but its still horrible.   Performance drops and wavers noticeably once there are a  lot  of zombies on the screen. This is mainly an issue in arena mode, where huge hordes are a common occurence. This is on an i5 3570K with an AMD 6950.     DLC:    Mostly forgettable...   The included vehicles are overpowered and spoil the progression of the story mode a little.   If you are still looking for more of the same  after  completing the game, you won't be disappointed with the additional race and arena maps. If you are expecting something different, don't bother.  
2632	1	a	I spent a few hours trying to get the game to work. It's crashed dozens of times. The graphics are awful. The port is basically a mess.  But despite it all this is one of the best games I've ever played. The story is great, the characters are quite interesting and the silly quirks will just make you laugh till your sides hurt.   If you like a good story and enjoy well written characters then you won't want to put this cult classic down for a second. Don't forget to use DPFix!

1879	0	a	  Was toying with the idea of picking this up, and the free weekend was my chance to see if it lived up to the high standards set by the first game. It didn't. The game seems to be a reboot of the Homefront series, rather than a sequel. In the first game, the North Koreans overpowered South Korea, then Japan, and allied with China to invade the US. In this game, North Korea is portrayed as affluent and technologically advanced, allowing them to invade America after the US defaults on a loan. Seeing as N. Korea has something like the 3rd largest standing army in the world, the first scenario seems much more likely and realistic to me. I see a lot of people throwing around the word 'unplayable' on Steam recently, but by and large, I think people are overreacting. This game isn't glitchy and bug-ridden to the point of being unplayable, just unenjoyable. Many times, I would enter a safehouse without the game registering that I had entered a safehouse. This means I could still fire my weapon, even killing everyone inside, often without my allies' weapons even loading into their hands. The AI is honestly some of the worst I've ever seen in a modern game. Countless times I have mowed down a KPA soldier, with his buddies standing not 10 feet away, with no reaction from them. Other times, specifically in yellow zones, I've been on the run from the KPA, and I've made a single turn, or hid behind something directly in the KPA's path, and they've simply given up the chase. I know a lot of people who really want to like this game (and believe me, I REALLY wanted to love it) will look at my almost 4 hours playtime and think 'that's not enough to judge this game by', and it kills me to say that it really is. Within 3.7 hours, I bought every gun and upgrade, with only a handful of the game's districts unlocked. This game truly has nothing else to offer me, aside from buggy character animations, a truly broken spawn system, and a drab, uninspired story. I've played games that are much, much worse. But for the reduced price of $24, you could certainly do much better. Thanks for the free weekend, Homefront, but no thanks.
2150	0	a	They need to fix their â¥â¥â¥â¥ because i cant even play the game because the light flickers constantly.
2416	0	a	My immediate first impression points towards this game having a lot of ambitous takes on the homefront series, the inclusion of free roam allows you to play this game as blandly or as badass as you want.   Scenarios in which the ai get into all out war with eachother are common but add some flare to the game, makes the world feel volitile. the games optimization could use some work from what I'm seeing in the disscussions a lot of people are reporting poor framerate.
2605	1	a	'Mr. Francis York Morgan, you are the protagonist of the generation. So says Mr. Stewart'  To summarize Deadly Premonition, the graphics suck balls. The driving sucks balls. The combat sucks balls. The animations suck balls. In fact the entire control scheme sucks monkey balls. But underneath all this ball sucking lies an absolute gem of a game.   The plot is great and the script is actually extremely well-written. I dare say these two factors were probably the only driving force behind my decision to see this game to the end. A higher budget and better production values might've done wonders with the game.  This game is one huge package of silliness. A lot of the time it will make you laugh but mostly you will be laughing at the game itself. Deadly Premonition is a game where you see your fortune in the morning cup of coffee. And there's an hour-long level where you're running after a dog. Did I mention that dog had its own rap theme song?   And just when you think this game couldn't get any stranger, the final two chapters take â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ness to a whole new level. Lovely!  Deadly Premonition is not a game you recommend to anybody. But it most definitely is a game that should be played at least once.

1405	1	a	Honestly, this game is not great but its not bad either. If you just want some mindless top down driver combined with zombies, go for it. It will get tedious over time so I ended up playing a few missions and then coming back to it months later. There are a few different game modes: story, races, etc. each of them are quite good but you will find yourself playing a few hours and getting fed up.
610	0	a	If you're seeing this review, then you're probably very interested in 'Lucius', a third person action-horror game where you play the son of the devil and go around reaping souls in pretty gruesome ways. While the concept looks good on paper, execution wise the game goes only halfway.  Whether intentionally or not, it's pretty humorous going around as a little kid and messing things up around the manor. The character himself never talks throughout the game, which is pretty creepy and is even made reference to at one point in the storyline. The abilities you are able to use are cool as well, like mind control, telekenisis, and even fireballs! (although you can only use that ability at specific points, mainly scripted events). Unfortunately that's where the positives really end, the storyline of the game is pretty bland and not very in-depth. Not that long into the game you'll start to get somewhat bored of it and would rather just go back to your own evil devices. The cutscenes (which I'm pretty sure use the in-game engine) are god-awful, ranging from out of touch lip syncing, wooden voice acting and PS2 textures. Another thing is that actually figuring what to do next is a challenge in of itself, most of the time you'll be wandering around the manor, bumping into different rooms and accidentally finding important items. The worst part is if you fail on a mission, you have to start the ENTIRE mission all over again, which mainly happened for me during the stealth sequences in the game. The worst kind of Trial and error. Overall, this game is only really worth getting if it's at a low enough discount (75% or above) and even then save it for when you don't have anything else to play. It's not worth the wait or hype. Again this is my opinion, if you have a different view and enjoy this game wholeheartedly then that's great! :) But for me, it was a mediocre experience.

1533	0	a	I wanted so badly for this to be good. Sadly, the title should've given it away; this is Homefront: The Revolution, not Homefront 2.  The first Homefront was a totally underrated FPS. It was linear, yes. The gunplay and mechanics were quite standard, yes. But there was a unique setting, some brilliant writing, and one moment every level where the only response I had was 'Wow.' Some of those moments still sit with me - in the gut, not in the brain. The same way Spec Ops: The Line still does.  But The Revolution does not have those moments. It's tutorial driven. Despite the half open world it still feels very linear. The story is worse. The writing is obtuse. The game went too cerebral. They thought about it too much and overplanned. Micromanaged. It goes to your head instead of your heart.  The graphics are ok - they weren't going to be the thing to make or break this game anyway. The controls are quite bad, mostly because there are some very important keys you can't re-assign (like holstering your weapon). Stealth is constantly suggested but impossible to actually pull off. The open world aspect felt more like a chore than anything approaching fun. The balance of money and points for upgrades is totally off: there's far too little early on and far too much later.  The whole system is buggy, especially around achievements and saving progress. The only reliable way to move forward is by sprinting back to a store to get a check point after accomplishing the optional objectives. If you don't and the game crashes while you're out in the world exploring you'll have to try to remember what you did and repeat it all.  The multiplayer is worth mentioning because I'm a sucker for co-op, especially with RPG elements. But this was terrible. The skills you unlock don't usually matter and it takes too long to get them (although it's worth noting that there are one or two that are totally overpowered compared to the rest). The different classes don't really complement each other. And finally, there isn't nearly enough content. Once you beat all the maps one time there isn't a strong incentive to keep playing.  I'm glad that they got this game out, but creating a game is very different than creating a  good  game. The latter is far more difficult, and requires a level of care and polish that simply isn't present in The Revolution.  Hopefully Homefront will get a true sequel one day. I'd enjoy that.

26	1	a	I've had this game in my library for some months now... But just recently started playing it. I did not expect this game to be that good! This is like a slower, but more strategy demanding game than more modern MOBA titles. You basically have to maintain control over certain points of interest to win the game.   Haven't played singleplayer modes.   POSITIVE: - Beautiful Design of characters and maps.  - Versatile gameplay styles depending on the map and Demigod you have chosen to play.  - Its a ton of fun for playing between friends.   NEGATIVE:  - Lack of online community.  - No tutorial.  - The Game crashed the first time I ran it on W10. But after a simple restart, the game functioned normally. I would expect more of these errors occur, but nothing too serious.   Note: Multiplayer skirmish games can last over an hour.   I recommend buying this game with a bunch of friends.

380	1	a	Well I thought it would be a mix of Hitman and King's Shining. But it's not. It's more like point-and-click adventure divided into 18 peices and you have to kill somebody in each piece. Playing as a little boy. You don't have any choices, you just need to figure out the right way and do it. The game has 2 most stupid achievements in the industry: 'play for 20 hours' and 'play for 40 hours'. I mean you can finish the whole game in 10 hours playing very slowly.
836	0	a	good idea, poorly executed. often difficult to navigate. buggy when it comes to retention of items, progress, events, etc. poor writing and mostly poor voice acting. ending is sudden and unsatisfying, partially due to poor pacing. that said, there are definitely some cool moments scattered throughout. on occasion, the mood and environment line up just right and one has to give credit for the creativity of some of the kills. unfortunately, the puzzles are usually overly simplistic or counterintuitive and the dark atmosphere and gory spectacles seem forced at times. i could mention several specific gripes, but the first example that comes to mind is    when lucius gains the power to control fire. lucifer specifically says 'now, you don't need matches!' immediately after this, the player must light candles with matches to advance.    when combat, precision, speed, stealth, etc. are involved, the game falls short and irrevocably spoils the decent bits. cool at first glance but overall a sophomoric effort. the best part was picking up    pornographic videos and trying to show my prized copy of 'â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ hunters' to my parents and housemates.

My opinions on Homefront: The Revolution -Really nice graphics, almost like a real cinematic movie. -The intro to the game is alot to take in as so much is happening already, you are a recruit afterall. -Distinctive urban enviroments and gameplay makes the game unique. -Characters have a personality making some of the gamescenes interesting   Also the best thing in this game is the Timesplitters 2 Easter egg, brings me back as a kid, amazing honestly.

Never felt this way before...sorrry!
2971	1	a	Deadly Premonition is one of my favorite games of all time. That being said this game really isn't for everyone. Watch some gameplay or a review and you'll pretty much know if this game is for you. Twin Peaks style, Humorous, B-movie, clunky survival horror game. If any of those points intrigue you I highly recommend you check DP out.   I'm aware the PC version has glaring issues, but I highly suggest you get this masterpiece on sale and do some tweaking with DP fix. You can also tweak the colors to your liking if the blue tint of the Director's Cut doesn't fit your personal taste. The PC also comes with all the DLC that was available when the DC originally launched on PS3. All in all, when it comes down to it, you either LOVE DP or HATE it. I urge anyone to give it a try as it is a unique and wonderful experience.  Perhaps look into your coffee next time and see if you find your answer?

1032	1	a	*Possible to change*   At this point, I have not finished the game but I can confidently say that I enjoy it. I find it kind of buggy and hard to control Lucius at times - which may just be my computer's fault - but overall I like the style, story and idea of the game. You get to play as a (very small but deadly) villian. You get to have Satan as your teacher. You have an open mansion to explore and discover. And you also get to slowly ruin your parents' lives as you cause an omen in their home.   Similar to a point and click game but your given other powers that don't only include picking up objects or shutting off devices etc, but the ability to use telekenesis and mind control and also combustion. You can only acquire your kills in specific ways, you cannot choose the way you kill people. It can be puzzling at times but the map normally guides you around the house and your journal gives you hints at what to do next.   I bought this while it was on sale for $1.99 and I'd reccommend it at that price. It's entertaining and keeps you going. I've been waiting forever to get a hold of this game for cheap and now I'm looking forward to see what Lucius II will be like.

2019	1	a	I honestly believe this game is really good! I do not know why people are complaining about it having a lot of bugs, frame rate issues, brain dead AI, and bad story. Well...... some of that is true but Dambuster Studio have indeed manage to fix some of these issues as they promised. My only problem with the game right now is that the story could have been better, (a little bit cheesy), The AI does need some fixing, and for some reason there are times when i start the game and when i get into the optimization is ok, but sometimes when I start the game again the performance it awful. Cannot tell if this is a bug or its just me  overall I do recommend this game, but be aware its not for everyone.
2114	0	a	I came Homefront The Revolution on Guerrilla Warfare. LOL. Is a lie.
3088	1	a	The graphics seem a bit clunky on the outset but the gameplay is fun and puzzley and the humor is nice. It's really funny to see how the future cultures see human artifacts from the past (current) technology age. The game itself really gets going in Chapter 3. There is so much to explore, the world is vast and beautiful, even haunting and spooky sometimes, the challenges are engaging. Just like Super Metroid, this is a good game to play alone at night just exploring the universe.

1576	1	a	I heard a lot of people â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ing up a storm about this game and I figured I'd give it a try for myself. Despite a rough start and some jank here and there in the form of hitched objective progression that required a couple of restart checkpoints to remedy, the game has overall been pretty crash / glitch free. The game is graphically impressive cranked all the way up, but it should be noted that on my i7 4790k / 980ti / ssd system I had to drop a few things down from very high to high, namely particle density and object detail, but all the other options were maxed at 1080 and I got a solid 60fps with vsync. Some strange hitching whenever autosaves are happening, but not too bad beyond that. The lighting at night in the rain is really quite pretty, and there are really impressive dust storms and fog effects on top of some ridiculously high res textures and water effects make for a better looking game than anything on offer in Fallout 4 and I'd even say there are aspects of the engine that look better than GTA V in an open world setting. I hope they finish optimizing the game for ultra settings.   The gameplay is a mix of Far Cry and Metal Gear in some weird ways, and there are even times when I found myself feeling like I was in a Fallout game. Stealth play is viable in most scenarios and the tools given to you come together later in the game to make for some interesting sabotage / raid situations. A good mix of mission objectives and open world enemy population / mission spawning ensures that you're always doing something different for what feels like the first 15 hours, after which the game settles in to a routine that I've little hope will change much through to the end, but that is OK because the gameplay loop is rather fun.   It should also be noted that the shooting is rather unforgiving and there are some guided mission objectives that are brutal and demanding. I almost gave up once or twice, but if you power on and have Dark Souls patience in you then eventually you'll get the hang of it. I'm playing on the medium difficulty and finding it just right. AI in general is a bit wonky but enemy engagements are good enough. Your friendly AI is indeed a bit dumb, but they serve as fodder long enough to give you the upper hand. This seems to be their job and they do it well enough.   Having just played DOOM and Uncharted 4 I came into this game with low expectations, between the highs those two games gave me and the review embargo for this game coupled with all the toxic forum discussions about what a turd this game was going to be I have to say that I'm glad I ignored all the naysayers. I'm looking forward to taking my time with the rest of the game. From what I've been reading about where I'm at in the campaign, I have another 10-15 hours to go on top of the 20 I already sunk in, and for my money that is a pretty good deal. I'd give this one a try.

355	0	a	Very slow and annoying that you cant skip a lot of the cut scenes. I am not very far into the game but after your first achivemnt it stops giving you hints on how to kill the person and you have to figure out random stuff. Like killing Gene, the map tells you to go straight to where Gene is but first you have to stop and get the screw driver from the other guy, but to figure that out I actually had to look it up online. Not much fun and very slow

302	1	a	This game isn't an awful game by any means, but it does have some issues in my opinion. The whole 'kill everyone, hail satan' aspect is pretty fun and the murder puzzles are logical but complicated. For each puzzle there is only one solution, you have no room for creativity. Also many of the puzzles require certain objects that aren't very obvious. If you can't remember where something is or you don't know what you need to find, you're screwed until you read or watch a walkthrough. So i wouldn't recommend this game to someone who rages or gets frustrated easily because it will probably be annoying for you. On the other hand, if you enjoy murdering the people who fed and raised you for 6 years of your life (virtualy of course) then you should definitely buy this game. Graphics are nice, fun concept and Satan is involved soooo buy it
2839	1	a	You may think when you see this game is just a crappy game. But if you dig deeper and play the game you will find out that the game has an amazing story. If you ignore the combat and the driving and graphics you will find an amazing game.

1142	1	a	My name is my own, but I assure you, it is important. My review is rather simple and to the point; Luciud is a fantastic game insofar as it is not only well written and acted, especially for an 'indie' developer, but the game itself is rather well made, easy to learn and presented well. The graphics, while not on the level of those super-realistic new games, are just as good as any, and better than I would expect to see. The voice acting, whilst not always on-cue, is itself fair. I have yet to finish the game, but I also have yet to encounter any sort of graphical, scripting or other errors one usualy finds in the 'bigger' games of today, bugs being so prevailient within most engines, I am supprised to find a 'clean' game. Now for the story, the one thing I hold highest in any game. The story is amazing, well written, well executed and in plain simple english, it is great. If this game were a book, it would be a great read and I would have trouble putting it down. You can be assured that apon completion of this game, I will be purchasing the next Lucius title, quite happily.
1690	1	a	I honestly don't understand the ridiculous amount of hate for this game. I mean sure there are other games with better optimiztion and better this and that, but the thing is there's always going to be games that are better at a certain thing than the game you're playing. This game is fun and unlike any game I've played. They borrowed certain aspects of other games but blended them nicely with a pretty good story and overall fun gameplay. If you're into fps and like completing side missions and clearing zones, I strongly recommend this game! Performance is good for me (i7 4790k &amp; evga 1080 ftw), but maybe hardware depent?   Only complaint is lack of DSR support.
1963	1	a	Played abit, it isn't that bad. Although there are several lackness for texture, and weapons. Graphics itself is a mixed, the lighting is great but the texture can use improvement here especially the weapons texture. There are still some bugs, such as AI bugs. Overall, for a less than 1 year title and already dropped price, I can say it is fairly worth it. If you can get it on sale, it will be more worth.

3031	1	a	If you've never played a Knytt game before, stop reading right now,  head over here  [nifflas.ni2.se] , and play Knytt and/or Knytt Stories for free. These games, created by a lone developer called Nifflas (also of NightSky and Saira fame), are some of the finest exploration-based platformers I've ever had the pleasure of playing. Knytt Underground is the most recent in the series, and while it might be the most ambitious, it makes some unexpected departures from the previous games.  You know you're in for something special when the game loads straight to a tutorial that turns out to be the main menu. There are three chapters in Knytt Underground, though the first two are essentially introductions to the massive third. You play both as Mi Sprocket, a mute little sprite, and Bob, a sentient bouncing ball from another early Nifflas game, Within a Deep Forest. Together they embark on a grand journey through the underground of a post-apocalyptic Earth far more mysterious and colorful than anything you've seen in Fallout. The surfaces you traverse are all shown in silhouette but the backgrounds are vibrant, animated collages of Photoshopped worlds. Every alien landscape you can imagine is represented here, with enormous gardens, crystal caves, blasted deserts, crumbling temples, ominous graveyards, and sinister machinery among them.  While you have a massive, massive map to explore, don't confuse this with a metroidvania. Mi and Bob never gain new abilities to navigate with, though their own basic skills provide a wealth of options. Mi can climb walls and Bob can bounce, and switching freely between the two allow you to pull of some surprising maneuvers. There are also colored seeds that grant Mi a one-time power like flying in a straight line, and robots that Bob can tether to. Creative use of these resources can indeed get you anywhere you need to go, no matter how impossible the passage seems. The result is almost like a puzzle game, where you'll find rooms that look like they need special powers to traverse, but eventually you'll have that eureka moment and puzzle it out yourself.  You'll have tons of items to find as well, and the denizens of the underground give quests that'll reward you with what you need or point you in the right direction. These items are used to pass the gates barring your ultimate objective, but there's some welcome flexibility to the collecting. One gate might require 5 items out of a possible set of 8, and if you find some of the game's well-hidden coins you can substitute them as well. This means you'll never get stuck on a particular puzzle for a single item, and exploration will always reward you with something you can use.  Previous Knytt games had stark pixel graphics and a distinct sense of isolation to them. Nifflas often populates his strange and alien worlds with little harmless critters but not sentient creatures, usually leaving you alone to explore the vast spaces in solitude. Knytt Underground is a sharp departure here, adding not only loads of characters to talk and deal with, but also giving them incredibly unexpected personalities. Everyone speaks with modern sensibilities, almost like irreverent sitcom characters. They'll call out their own foibles and contrivances, and denigrate a lot of your quests as pointless busywork. One of your two pixie companions is also as foul-mouthed as you can imagine, frequently telling people to go â¥â¥â¥â¥ themselves and eat glass and such. It's such a weird departure in tone from the previous games, even moreso in how their hideous, blobby portraits clash with the clean lines of the rest of the game.  The NPCs are the only major knock against an otherwise atmospheric experience, and to be fair, seeing their character arcs through redeems the worst offenders. Even on top of the 10+ hours of exploration the game offers, there are a host of secrets to find. Some are tied up in the game's unique and challenging fast travel system which I won't spoil, but be aware there's no easy teleporting around the enormous map until you master it. Just like the rest of the game, though, it's worth putting the time into to experience. Knytt Underground is a marvelous journey from start to finish, one that's easy to immerse in and immensely rewarding to play.

2130	1	a	I was one of the lucky ones. Somehow the hardware gods smiled upon me, and I got zero lag and artifacts. However, buyer beware, the majority of people are getting heavy lag issues. The reason i recomend, is that it is a very enjoyable game, but you might as well wait for patches and a sale. I wish there was a middle of the road button, it just didn't feel right giving it the thumbs down. I'm really enjoying myself.

But then you play it, and you right click on some one, and it goes ok, and maybe there is a spell or two and then you die and come back, and you buy items and you arent sure if they did anything and then you win or lose and you hhave NO IDEA if it was because of you. 10/10

1750	1	a	Really good game i thought. It runs pretty great. The graphics and details within the world are incredible. The story while not amazing is pretty good. Surprising amount of variety in missions and how to acomplish them (not in terms of how you choose to get there more so how its set up for you to get there). The guns feel good and sound good.   The game can be quite challenging at times, you are not a super hero. Damage is quite harmful in this game, so you are forced to alter your play style constantly.  The game feels like playing Far Cry 3/4 but set in excellent war torn cities and towns to roam around.   Its surprisingly lengthy too, if you can be bothered to find everything and capture everything for every district.  Play it and make up your own mind.

2213	1	a	The game turned out to be unexpectedly fun. There is a gigantic open world environment that is interesting to explore. There is a surprisingly complex weapon upgrade system, vehicles are supported and there is stealth gameplay. The game is a mess in many ways ... It is readily apparent that the details were a secondary concern in this massive, almost bloated, game. For example, when you use a flashlight, the illumination drags behind the camera movements ... to simulate a hand actually holding a flashlight I guess? The end result is that you feel seasick and disoriented from using one of the basic tools in the game.  The main missions are diverse, but the experience is very incoherent. Remember how Valve makes an effort maintain the first person perspective with free camera movements in both combat, traversal, and story beats? This game is kind of the opposite. It feels like a patchwork of disjointed parts.  Performance is a mess in large open world sections, that make up the majority of the game, even when using a Titan X.   This game reminds me of an infamous classic in the open world genre: Do people still remember Boiling Point: Road to Hell from the russian developer Deep Shadows? Both Homefront and that game are reaching for the stars on a too limited budget. The game systems are bloated and lack refinement, but they are overcompensating by providing a lot of content and scope. It kind of works, I guess? Homefront definitely feels like a unique take on the open world genre, just like Boiling Point did in its time. Just don't expect a smooth ride, because this game is full of bugs, confusion and questionable design decisions. Take it or leave it?

956	1	a	While I was initially disappointed that Lucius wasn't a a free-for-all murder-athon something akin to Naughty Bear, I did grow to enjoy the game when I finally reconciled that it was completely scripted. You play as Lucius, supposed son of a very wealthy politician, when you find out on your sixth birthday that you're actually the son of satan. Your real father then tasks you with killing as many people as can, for with each soul you sacrifice, your powers will grow.  Each murder is its own chapter and puzzle with varying difficulty. Your map will always lead you to the person you're supposed to kill, and from there you must figure out the method needed. You journal, as well as the dialogue from other people within your household, will give you hints on how each person is to be dispatched.  The murder scenes can be quite graphic, and there is some nudity, but if neither of these bother you, go ahead and buy the game at full price, the game is worth it.
2617	1	a	 1. The Port,  Let's get this out of the way. The port is bad. No graphics options, 720p only. This can be fixed by using the DPfix by Durante, and downloading HD fonts, HUD and icons. The game likes to crash for many reasons and in many different ways. Most of them can be prevented by smoking cigarettes (in the game, but I can assure you it also helps IRL), editing the exe file with CFF Explorer, running the game with compatibility mode set to Win98, running the game in window mode and/or changing default controls to a gamepad. There's apparently a bug that corrupts your save file, but I luckily haven't encountered that one.  During my 29 hours of gameplay at least 5 of them I had to replay because of the crashes. Googling, setting and fixing stuff to be able to even play the game took me around another 3 hours.  It was worth it.   2. The Gameplay.  Deadly Premonition is an open-world survival horror detective action adventure game. You can explore (by foot and by car) the town of Greenvale at your leisure, doing side activities, like quests, fishing or collecting stuff. However, you need to eat and sleep (or drink coffee). During the main questline you mainly travel around, talk to people, solve simple puzzles and shoot some undead zombie-like things. There are also boss fights. The combat generally resembles that of traditional survival horror games like Resident Evil or Silent Hill. Walk away from the enemies, turn around, prepare your weapon and shoot.  The attention to detail is especially worth the praise. You need to wash your suits and shave if you don't want to look like a hobo. When you pass another car at night, its front lights reflected in your own rear-view mirror will blind you for a brief moment. And car mirrors don't even work besides that. Other mirrors you encounter do work fine though.  Let's not forget about the ridiculous, idiotic and totally uncalled-for QTE sequences. They're so bad, it makes them almost good.   3. The Story.  FBI agent Francis York Morgan arrives in the town of Greenvale to investigate a case of murder. Then appear the aforementioned zombie things making the whole plot a hillarious mess. The story is great, even though it doesn't make much sense. At least there are some nice plot twists and everything gets explained by the end of the game. The cutscenes and dialogues are simply a piece of art. Thanks to the music completely unfitting the situation in most cases, they are genuinely funny.   4. The Characters.  This has to be the selling point of DP. There's a lot of different characters and the great most of them have personalities of their own. York himself is quite an individual. He talks to his second personality, Zach, all the time, even with people around, without a trace of embarrasment. He's also a walking bag of strange habits and mannerisms. The whole Greenvale looks like an uncanny valley. Getting to know those people is totally worth the effort.   5. The Summary.  Don't be discouraged by all those technical problems I mentioned   (and those that I did not)   - Deadly Premonition is a great game and the quality of the PC port doesn't change that fact in the slightest.  Objectively 9.5/10.

2919	1	a	I mean, to say this is basically  Twin Peaks: The Video Game  would not only be far from a unique observation, but also an incredibly surface level impression. Sure, much like  Twin Peaks , the goofy and awkward nature of the game only adds to the charm and does nothing to detract the effectiveness of the genuinely spooky elements. The thing about  Deadly Premonition  is that it is significantly darker and the awkward quirky-ness is also reflected into the graphics.   Still, I'm only, like, a chapter in and I know I'll be pouring way more hours into this than I probably should. The gameplay works sort of like  L.A. Noire . The game isn't as much about gameplay as it is about story. The combat isn't the most important part. The 'game' operates much more like an interactive film or television show ('Previously in the investigation' or something along those lines greets you after loading the game)  I suppose my only complaint is that some of the combat sequences seem out of place. The game shines its brightest in the script and characters so maybe the awkward combat mechanics just pale in comparison to the strange town of Greenvale.  Deadly Premonition  is probably one of my favorite games out there right now.

1908	1	a	Played the game from start to finish on Deathwish difficulty during the free weekend. I'm glad I waited, because it's fantastic.  I know the game was off to a troubled start, and so I waited until the invetible free wekend after the latest (as of Sep 11, 2016) patch to try the game out.  Finally, after all these patches, the game is now complete. And it's pretty good.  The combat is rock solid - I love the feel of the weapons. Some of them aren't really viable, but they're fun to play around with anyways. The story seems to jump around a lot towards the end, but it was overall coherent and emotional. Not Oscar-level, but good enough to keep me interested.  You really do get the feeling of a desperate, scrappy urban combat. The difficulty ramps up nicely and I always felt challenged. Being able to recruit up to 4 resistance members to chum around with takes the game from good to great - the game is nearly impossible on the hardest difficulty without support and knowing when to just run.  Overall, I would say this game is as good as Far Cry 3 - maybe even better, since I prefer the urban combat.

2440	1	a	Q: Is this a good game? A: No. This game is not good.  Q: Is this game worth playing? A: Yes.  In Inquisitor, you play as an inquistor (duh..) who were send to investigate a case of a murder in a small town. You can choose to play from 3 character, either as a paladin of the brotherhood (knight), a noble (thief) or a priest (sorcerer).  The game takes investigation and detective works seriously and does not hold your hand like modern games - there is no quest marker, only logs of quests and hints. Hints are gathered from talking to NPCs, asking them questions. Now, there is no real brain involved in gathering hints - you just talk to ALL the NPCs and eventually some clue will be uncovered. After the all the detective work, it all end to one thing: is the suspect really a heretic or just an innocent? You decide.  Convicting people under the charge of heresy need proof. Proof can be a spoken testimony from witnesses or a physical thing like a broken dagger. This detective work will involve lots of wall of texts, so be prepared to do some reading.  Inquisitor really puts you into the atmosphere and setting. You're involved in the age where heresy are on a rampant. Everyone accuses someone as a heretic. People are very suspicious to each other.  Now to the major flaw of the game. Inquisitor tries to be an RPG which is heavy on the 'talking and reading' part - immersive story and atmosphere like Planescape Torment (I never really like this game though), and tries at the same time to be an action oriented RPG with fluent combat like the Diablo series. Inquisitor fails terribly on the latter part.  Combat in Inquisitor feels like a chore. You'll be chugging potions all the time. Your equipment will be broken in the middle of a battle most of the time (if you choose difficulty other than easy). Your melee attack misses all the time and when you actually landed an attack on the enemy, you're already run out of stamina. The combat need serious rebalancing in reworked, but it is very unlikely that this game will be updated in the near future since the developers already left the game. The whole development of Inquisitor takes around 10 years.   The game is divided into 3 acts. Only the first act really impressed me since it really emphasize on the inquisition stuff and investigations. Further into the game, the game lost its momentum and instead of uncovering heretics and doing inquisition stuff, you'll need to clear several dungeons that are filled with crazy debuff inflicting monsters that are totally not enjoyable.  I think I was 80% to finishing this game until I decided that I cannot tolerate the combat anymore. Even with the major flaw Inquisitor is a game that you might not want to miss if you like old school RPG.
1216	1	a	This remake of Zombie Driver adds some new content and modes to play, though the modes are kinda useless the base game itself is still very enjoyable and fun. A top down isometric GTA style view except now with more zombehs. Choose diff vehicles and enjoy mowing them all down. The plus for the remake in HD is the controls work much better instead of the confused mess they were in the last version. The tournament mode is sorta meh, rubberband racer AI, weird things that make your car flip over or spin around. Ignoring the modes which are a failed experiment, the game itself gives what all zombie fans want more of, more zombies! Lots of replayability with mission select so you can test out all the cars to get your zombie fix.  Rating: 10/10 Value: $9.99

1519	1	a	Homefront: The Revolution is an underrated shooter with brisk open-world conquest, proficient weapons and engaging mechanics. Although the story is flimsy, major characters hold it together. Set in Philadelphia, the game focuses on an underground resistance group fighting the occupying North Korean forces. The Goliath vehicle (from Homefront 1) returns, but players must clumsily escort it because, sadly, they cannot command it. Story missions are rough, especially those near the weak ending.  This is a sandbox game, first and foremost. The initial world building is not as good as its predecessor, but the world design and gameplay are much better. Players will shoot and sneak their way through a few sizable levels. The basic goal is to capture âStrike Pointsâ in each level and retake America one piece at a time.  There are two Zone typesâRed and Yellow. Red Zones are warzones with a heavy âNorkâ presence that shoot on sight. Airships slowly patrol above and you do not want to get caught in their spotlight. Stealth is encouraged initially and, after gaining sufficient ground, additional resistance soldiers make the levels safer. Yellow Zones are smaller residential locations that encourage hit-and-run tactics. These tend to use more vertical space and utilize cameras to keep civilians in line. Stealth is easier because you can blend into the crowd. After winning enough respect, civilians will riot which also reduces danger.   The difference between each area is refreshing, even though many tasks are similar. You will hack antennas, capture strongholds, recharge generators with motorbikes, and even do some basic parkour navigation. Some tasks are random, like saving civilians or killing officials. It is strange that many Strike Points can be captured while enemies are still hostile nearby, but this makes for rapid conquest. The two different Zone types provide natural pacing and satisfying conquest  Sadly, Revolution has its share of bugs. Problems include: not being able to complete side jobs, grenades falling through the ground, and enemies disappearing. My character even flew high into the air, after getting off a motorbike that was barely moving. Also, after capturing one Strike Point, the game spawned me inside a shelf. Performance is not the bestâwith a few late-game crashesâalthough it still looks good on medium settings with changing weather and a day-night cycle. The game is not technically polished, but it is quite playable.  Using CryEngine, the AI has familiar routines and similar problems. Sometimes they walk into walls, float above the ground, or forget they got shot. Fortunately, they also have many positives. They react appropriately to dead bodies, sounds, and thrown projectiles. Toss a Molotov near soldiers and survivors will search the approximate source location. Cause a large explosion and Norks will swarm that area, reducing the threat elsewhere. The AI does not cheat; they move and shoot based on your last position. The mostly-clever, partially-glitchy AI makes for decent action.   There are several effective stealth options, including a melee takedown, silenced pistol, and proximity devices. RC cars can be driven short distances to produce chaos elsewhere; you can even drive them under vehicles undetected. There is a great selection of guns, including a powerful sniper and an excellent assault rifle. Enemies and vehicles have weak spots, so positioning and accuracy is important. The Hack grenades will temporarily turn autonomous vehicles against the Norks and these devices are also used for puzzles. It is a shame that you can only carry two primary weapons but they have alternate modes (e.g. the crossbow turns into a flamethrower) and it usually isnât far to change loadouts.  Multiplayer is co-operative only, although this is not a bad thing. Players become a resistance soldier and complete missions across the same zones from the single player. You might escort vehicles, breach strongholds or rescue prisoners. Stealth functions well, in fact the co-op plays much the same as the solo mode. There are skills, outfits, and boostsâthey could have been part of the single player to add more depth. There are only 6 missions (more are planned) that take around 10 minutes to complete. You typically buy crates to refill consumables, and the RNG Gods will dictate whether you get a useful hack device or a 10% XP boost. Itâs a grind without enough content, and there is barely anybody playing just weeks after launch.   Homefront: The Revolution will provide around 15-20 hours of decent action in the single player, assuming players capture all Strike Points. What makes it successful is in how it presents the world and how it provides small encounters with different objectives. There are barely any drawn-out battles, and tasks can be completed without firing a shot. Players can progress through zones in any direction, avoiding snipers or destroying enemy patrols, and the encounter spots are rarely the same. Itâs a sandbox game, so the experience relies heavily on letting you have fun in bite sized pieces. The game achieves this more often than not. Homefront: The Revolution is far from perfect, as numerous bugs, AI quirks, poor story missions, and performance issues hold it back. But damned if it isnât enjoyable to enter a hostile sandbox and have it completely under control after an hour or two of competent shooting. 7 / 10

2750	1	a	One of the most enjoyable games i've every played. A little clunkly, but the whole thing is written with a lot of heart which is something you don't see enough of. Technically a horror game i guess, but overall has a really nice laid-back atmosphere which isn't something you might expect from this sorta game. Comparisons to Twin Peaks and Resident Evil are inevitable, but it has a real unique flavor of its own which is where the game really shines.  (plus this game seems to go on sale often for just a few dollars so it's a great cheap buy if want to wait)

2920	1	a	I don't even know where to begin to describe this. This is probably the worst PC port in the history of ports (even worse than Dark Souls). It crashes constantly and has little glitches here and there. That's not even touching upon the absolutely horrendous combat and driving mechanics. But hell if this wasn't one of the most unique games I've ever played. And the story is one of the best I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing in a game, and for that alone I'd recommend this game over a hell of a lot of other titles. If it's on sale and you think you can stomach the little fixes and mods you'll need to actually run it, you might just love it. Otherwise, pick up the more stable PS3 or Xbox 360 versions.

1863	0	a	  Homefront: The Revolution is an unfortunate case of the whole being less than its parts. Itâs clear there were a number of unique ideas being bandied about during the development of this game, and thereâs certainly shadows of those ideas in the full release, but its âme tooâ design fails to come together in any meaningful way. As a complete package, it struggles on many levels to deliver, chiefly, the story and gameplay. With time, many of the bugs should be fixed, and who knows, maybe the DLC offered post-release might improve on the story. At the moment, from former Free Radical developers, Homefront: The Revolution is nothing less than a disappointing, if not outright terrible game.
875	1	a	I liked this game.
555	1	a	A twisted game that is definitely for horror fans, if you love movies like The Omen then this is for you. IMy only complaint is that the killings are scripted so there is no freedom on how you kill your victims.

436	1	a	Loved this game. Hated everything about the ending, both the puzzle and action version were extremely frustrating! Completed the puzzle ending after lots of attempts only to find the steam achievements for the last 3 deaths were not recognised. Having now gone the action route I have been able to kill the priests and get the achievements but cannot get the dad in the right place to dispose of him and finding that it's game over after one hit from him is frustrating.

1300	1	a	This game is crazy fun. I got for $1.00 with my rank ups and I have to say it is very well done. If you like running over Zombies in that old format similar to the original Grand Theft Auto, Why not Zombie Driver? It's got a ton of features including updgrades for your vehicle and weapons. Give a shot.
3080	0	a	A fun game for a while but loses it's flair after the second chapter. It's pretty much a constant back and forth through the map quest. Irritating platforming that just did hold my interest. The story was not interesting to me and got to were I was just skipping through dialog cause I didn't care anymore.  The game can be beat in a good amount of time as the first two levels are short. The third is the lengthy one and is were I decided to just give up. My interest in games has changed over the years I tend to find some games I would have loved before boring and not worth finishing,  In my opinion I wouldn't recommend this to any friends. Some may love it as the reviews show but for me it's a no.

3055	1	a	As a fantasticly atmospheric game, with top notch platforming and a well written and unique story, Knytt Underground is my favorite game of 2013.
2733	1	a	As I kept playing, I've come to love this game's bulls***t. There's so much to like about it that I found myself ignoring a lot of errors and problems with the game. So, as a video game, this is actually a bad one. But as someone's vision, as a project, it's some kind of amazing.  PS: It's a very bad PC port, but with a quick fix it's playable.
666	0	a	If I could remove this game from my library I would :cgpout:. The game story isn't new I know but I guess it's hard to be this much evil even in a virtual world, not that anyone is absolutely good, but still this is just too much. I do like to play a villain from time to time. It's fun and thrilling. They usually have a nice background story attached to them, too. Lucius lacks the depth and roundness of a villain character.It focuses more on evil for the sake of being evil and no reason at all besides that.You play as a six year old hell-spawn who is bent on mercilessly torturing and killing other NPCs. The game gives the player the tools to creatively excute the non-suspecting NPCs. I'm only not recommending the game because of its emphasis on the game major source of fun which is killing.  You can be evil and wreak havoc without spilling one drop of neither real nor virtual blood, that's creativity in its finest!

3093	1	a	When you do get to the end, you're probably going to want to come back to the beginning - or at least the beginning of third chapter. Knytt Underground is a more conspicuously narrative-driven sequel to Knytt Stories and Within A Deep Forest, and puts the platforming mechanics of each (climbing and bouncing, respectively) to good use. Those two mechanics are most of what you'll be doing in this game - besides gawking, since the art and soundtrack are absolutely lovely - and honestly it's a lot of fun just to get around. The game world's vast, once you get into it, and if you want to take it all in, you can easily spend upwards of twenty hours just exploring its labyrinthine and visually stunning caves, tunnels, and underwater labs. It's paced a bit slow for a metroidvania adventure - Knytt Underground is about exploration, with very few enemies and a lot of map. But it's the world design, not the enemies, that make this game what it is, and the environments will make you work out how to get from A to B in some very clever ways. There are caverns and side challenges that require you to string together perfectly timed mid-air button presses, secret rooms (over 500 of them in addition to the 1,440 that appear on the map) and a huge variety to the places you'll visit that makes discovering a new area feel exciting. What a game! Knytt Underground brings together the knuckle-biting platforming challenges with an endearing and memorable landscape, introspective dialogue, really genuinely fantastic sound design, and over three and a half hours of gorgeous background music. Don't miss the music, it's really great.
2873	1	a	QTE's broke my controller, story broke my mind. 10/10
2647	1	a	This is my first ever Steam review and unfortunately itâs going to be more of a fix suggestion than a review (my review was very long initially but Steam wouldnât allow me to submit it so I had to chop it considerably). I was able to fix this game (so that it ran) fairly quickly. Here's how I did it:  1. Go to where the game is installed on your PC. For me it's at C &gt; Program Files (x86) &gt; Steam &gt; steamapps &gt; common &gt; Deadly Premonition The Director's Cut 2. Open the redist file and double-click the application called PhysX_SystemSoftware (.msi) 3. Select the Repair option and let it run through completely.  4. When that's finished, launch the game again.  NOTE: I should point out that I AM running the game in compatibility mode (Windows XP SP3). For me, this fix worked immediately. I DID NOT download the 4GB patch that's been suggested! I hope this helps some of the people who were having trouble.   Do I recommend this game? Yes! I can't recommend it enough. In fact, it's one of my favorite games of all-time (I played the 360 version previously). However, if you are expecting not to have to caress this game softly in order to make it purr â it is probably not for you!  If you are willing to put in a little effort though - I think you will be pleasantly surprised at everything you get out of this game.

As for the gameplay, I couldn't tell yet. So far the story seems compelling and the gameplay seems okay. Will update in the future with more gameplay. For now -- the game functions properly except for the few people complaining about 60 fps and all that jazz.
4531	1	a	 Early Access Review
2608	1	a	 WARNING : This game is buggy as hell, and requires a lot of patience and/or workarounds to play.   Deadly Premonition  -- which may as well be called  Twin Peaks: The Game  -- is a great game idea poorly executed and even more poorly ported to the PC from consoles. Game-breaking bugs (such as disappearing keys) and random crashes (only avoided by playing problematic sections in Windows 98 compatibility mode) will bite you if you're not expecting them, so consulting a guide or walkthrough ahead of each section is practically compulsory.  So... why am I recommending it? Despite its faults,  Deadly Premonition  is so delightfully weird that I can't  not  recommend it. The story is fantastic, the characters are memorable, the murdery mystery is compelling, and the comic relief is hilariously bizarre.  Pick it up on sale (it's often about $2.50) and you'll definitely get your money's worth.

2356	1	a	Played for 30 minutes on my Core i7 Skylake and GTX 980ti. Have not encountered ANY lag or FPS issues, everything has been smoth.   Are people not upgrading their graphics driver? The latest Nvidia driver is 365.19.   So far my playthru has been fun and I have not noticed any glitches that would interfere with performance or my playthru. So if people are having problems then make sure you meet the recommended specifications from the store page.   Continuing on my review the story of how North Korea came to take over the USA is laughable but hey its a game!   For what this game is I have played much worse games than this but Homefront so far has been very enjoyable and will be part of the revolution and take out some NORKS.

1797	1	a	Just bought the game, Just started the first area. It's alot like farcry. So far the story is ok, And the gameplay is fine. I don't understand why people gave it such bad reviews. IF you like farcry you WILL like this game.  Edit: Just finshed the game, It was good. I still can't understand why it got bad reviews??? Yes, the AI is not the best but it was still fun.
2226	1	a	First off I am on a AMD FX 8350 eight core 16G of ram with a nvidia 970 and i run windows 7.. Game runs great for me I dont understand why all the negative posts and reviews. When i check most of the negative posters dont even have the game and they couldnt have gotten a refund that fast to have it removed from thier account. So why the hate?    Anyway cut scenes were good, voice acting decent. Graphics decent Gameplay is very similar to Dying Light with all the climbing and such. Neat traps all over the place for you to use just like dying light and loot is all over.   Fun game I just getting into the campaign , have not tried multiplayer yet but thats soon
1947	1	a	First of all. I dont see why people say this game is broken. I didnt stumble upon any bugs or glitches at all while i played.  Singplayer: Campaign is good in my opinion. Things to upgrade and modify. Was free for a weekend. I managed to complete the game throughout that weekend. Though at the cost of skipping alot of side mission stuff. Was mostly just interested in the story.  Throughout the campaign there is only 1 choice you have to make. I only did it once, so i only know one outcome. And you wanna check your phone. Not just for this choice. But in general too. Throughout the campaign is has the different peoples opinions and thoughs. Adds a good deal i think.  Multiplayer: Network errors. I dont think you can play online at all.   Overall. Good Game for singleplayer. Though i wont risk buying this game, cause the multiplayer doesnt seem to work at all. And because i allready completed singleplayer. So i have no more interest in the game.

1566	0	a	Pros: -Good graphics -Dense and interesting world -GREAT concept. WOLVERINES!  Cons: -Buggy, I get really mad if a bug stops me from completing objectives. It was a side mission but for me it's hard to continue on with that marker stuck there and there is nothing I can do. -Optimization is bad. Really bad, with a GTX 970 I should never drop below 30fps on normal settings. Also lots of stuttering. -Lack luster story. I just never really felt engaged or connected to the characters. -Open world is a bit if a stretch. Once you open a new area there is very little insentive to go back. -Gameplay is just OK. Was a little clunky, felt more like an rpg playstyle set in a FPS. Stealth could also use some work, at a certian point you learn to just run.  4/10 for now, I feel like it would be a 6/10 with enough patches, a lot of patches. 
2352	0	a	NOT WHAT I EXPECTED!
2565	1	a	Will you think the graphics on PC are trash? -Yes. Will you mod this game to fix the graphics? -Yes. Will you rage when the game spontaneously crashes once in a while? -Yes. Will you for some inexplainable reason love this game despite all of its flaws? -YES!  In all seriousness, DP is worth a try. If you're willing to do a little modding, and you grab this game on sale, you can't go wrong. That's what I did, and I don't regret it. I've enjoyed the game so far, and would recommend it.

2972	1	a	It's a weird game. Play it only if you have the patience to absorb the bugs and a bad port. Aiming weapons is really limited. Driving is atrocious. I have an issue with side quests available during a particular weather. That doesn't make sense. But availability of side quests at certain timings in a day is realistic. But the game has a good story, keeps you guessing on who the killer is. All the characters are well written and there are many of them. Huge attention to detail.

1628	1	a	This game is just great!  If you like a game that puts you in charge of a Rebellion group, trying to fight thier opressors, this is just a great job of the devs!   The pro's:  - The graphics are just nice! - Lots of weaponary to put your character just in the place that you want it. - Multiplayer is a little small, this needs improvement but it's still okay if you find a match! Leveling up is exciting because the more you've got, the funnier it is, even the clothes you put on makes you stronger/weaker.  - The gameplay is great, even if there are some little bugs. - The missions are just fun, getting control upon bases of your enemy! - It isn't always that 'easy' to get everything trough. - The story it tells is great, you'll always BE a hero!  - Con's  - Small multiplayer community, not a big deal, but it is affecting it... - Sometimes buggy and laggy, I don't know why it is, but if you'll be okay with it, it'll be still fun to play! (Like I did!) - the way you can transport isn't always great, this made me think a lot to get from A to B, here they've could done something.
2431	0	a	At first glance, this game holds a lot of promise... looks like it will be heaps of fun for people who enjoyed the Far Cry franchise. Sadly, it completely fails to live up to expectations...  1. There are a heap of clipping problems. Enemies see you through walls. In some places, enemies walk through walls. Things and people sink into floors. Some items you need to gather are unreachable because the buggy clipping stops them from falling into your reach. 2. Weird AI. Its like it was engineered to be annoying. You know those enemies that somehow miraculously know to duck when you target them with your sniper rifle? And then jump out of cover if you turn your back on them - when you're completely behind cover and they can't possibly see that you've turned your back. After a couple of hours, I started to use this technique to draw enemies out of cover. Its kind of funny making enemies dance by pointing a sniper rifle at them - watching them lurch from side to side to avoid the sniper's line of fire. 3. Scripting glitches. Some of the missions become impossible to complete because of some lazy scripting on the part of the programmers. 4. Infinite enemies. I've always been challenged by whether a game should have reasonable 'reinforcements' mechanics - but in this game, well... its just more lazy coding. Enemies randomly spawn infinitely. The programmers tried to cut some code so that enemies don't spawn where you're looking - but they screwed that up too.  After many hours of persisting in the hopes that things would get better, I'm abandoning it.

The latency is what makes the game hard to play. I will have to wait to until this game has some serious patch work done to it.   I do not recommend anyone to buy this game until further work is done with it to make sure it is optimized. I would rather have waited longer for this game to come out and be ready. GG

Your father is running for senate, but with all the death going on inside his home, he fears he will lose. Nobody suspects that a 6-7 year old boy has the capability of commiting over 15 murders.  The game took me about 8.5 hours to beat and get 56 of the 58 achievements, the two I didnt get being the 'Play 20 Hours' and the 'Play 40 Hours' achievements. It was fun while it lasted, but paying $20 for a game that took 8 hours to beat seems a little overpriced. It has a good story, and its extremely fun and intriguing, but I wish it lasted a bit longer. It would be worth every penny if it was only $10.

1609	1	a	So I played this game for a few hours on and off for a few weeks. I was not really a fan of the first one but I really like the concept that the homefront story line has to offer. When I first started playing the bugs and the system slowdowns really, really, really killed the game for me and stopped playing it (got to the game breaking bug were I met some random dude before the armory got raided). On a whim I decided to pick it up again after fallout 4 and because of the patching the game is FAR BETTER and actually worth playing.  The game is not the game I wanted Homefront TR to be but it is ok and a good way to kill a few hours. By far my biggest issues with this game is two fold...  1. The lack of weapons, in the first Homefront there were tons of different weapons from several types of HMG, MMG, SMGs, pistols, AR/AK variants, ect. In this game there are maybe about 12'ish weapons that are diverse but you get the one or two that work with your play style and generally keep them. With the last homefront you felt that need to pick up a new weapon every few mins because you felt the need to try this M4 with the EO Tech, oh look a AK with a CCO, OMG a Shotgun with a ACOG!!!!!!  2. This game suffers from the Farcry outpost capturing bug. Once you clear a sector it is sort of rinse and repeat, there are sectors that are more fun to libreate such as the one where the KNA supporters live but once again there is little variety.   TLDR: Good game (NOW), pick it up on sale, waste a few hours that god has given us and move on with your life. Wish they used the weapon variety that the old homefront had.

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. If you do ignore this message and purchase it, make sure you do this through PAYPAL, that way you can dispute it through them, the game is not a completed game as steam advertises it to be.

256	0	a	I'm editing my previous review out of newfound spite for this game.  My previous review stated that I would recommend this game with a fantasticly placed and thought out 'na'  Seeing the development of the game, I would like to reconsider my absolutely awful review and say that my review clearly stated the quality, time and care that the developers put into this mess of a game.   Basically, don't waste your time; the game is NOT done and NEVER will be. You will probably have better fun burning paper and stapling yourself in the face, and you won't have to pay for that.   I refuse to mention any of the gameplay because, there simply is none.
1174	1	a	This game is fun and interesting, but sometimes funny glitches pop up.  Also don't expect too much, because there are some annoying bugs. Achievements are easy and fast to do, except 'I like this game' and 'I'm Addicted' achievements.  Good story, fun to kill those people, good sounds.  8.5/10 
776	1	a	This is a really fun game that gives you the feeling of being the bad guy. You do the harm, you are the charackter that all the others should fear. To me, this was very exiting. I have never played a game like this before. Absolutly worth a try, you will absolutly love it!

367	0	a	I was drawn in by the idea to experience a bit of 'The Omen' perhaps, but the execution is poor. Very clucky controls what frustrate at times making it had to naviagate the world or select objects to interact with. The worst is during what was a firey confrontation, I fell through the world as I attempted to turn a cross upside down, only to do it again when I respawned. The third time I passed through a locked door and could not reenter to finish the fight.  Overall, it is very sloppy. The story line was what I expected but after the 11th 'chapter' the initial novelity had worn out.
1578	1	a	This is a good solid game. I have played it a lot of hours during the free trial weekend. I don't know how it was at launch, but I think it's pretty good now. I plan on buying it when all the DLC is out.

2492	1	a	Plays like a cross between Planescape torment and Divine Divinity. Not as good as either. Story is quite mature and lots of reading involved, which may or may not be a good thing depending on how you like your games. A lot of time and dedication went into the making of this game, and it is clearly a work of love by the creators. Buy it. 80 out of a 100 in my opinion.
1849	0	a	the game is still glitchy even after the patch. I was looking forward to playing this game but after about an hour or two the game becomes unplayable. i would have thought when they or if they tested the game they would have noticed the poor performance. I suppose there is nothing we can do except keep up the complaints and hope they decide to get there finger out and actually do something about it. I give it a well deserved 3/10 do not buy if your smart.

2378	1	a	I grabbed the game during the Steam free weekend, and after about 4 hours, decided to buy it with the discounted price, and in my opinion it's fully worth it. Certainly not worth the bad reputation, regardless of how bad it was at launch.  It's easily one of the best looking games out there at the moment. I especially love how they use dynamic lights a lot and night scenes are most of the time visually astonishing.  Story is average, gameplay is good, visuals are top notch and performance is very good. The world could be more reacting and persistent, and there are enemies that seem to appear from nowhere at times, but other than that, I don't have anything negative to say. There's also some kind of co-op, but I haven't tried that.  It's definitely worth the 24 euro price tag it has at the moment.  +Great atmosphere (audio and visuals) +Runs great +Looks beautiful +Solid gameplay -Alternate timeline premise is a bit silly -Lack of dynamic behaviour in the game world
691	0	a	I am not impressed. It gets pretty boring and repetitive pretty fast. Including the idea is rather bland, simple minded, unoriginal, and many aspects of the game are very dull. Many of its 'missions' have too little guidance and leaves too much for you to figure out on your own by some miracle. And there are also poor graphics which should not effect gameplay however in numerous occasions graphics glitches occur and materials often clip. There is alot that needed to be worked on in this game, it may have some potential to be decent...somewhere in there, but I don't see it. I strongly recomend that you do not play this game. Honestly, this game should be free, there is absolutely no reason at all for it to be $ 9.99. If you were to pay one dollar for this, you would be paying two dollars too much.
1833	0	a	You know what... i think i perfer the last homefront game......................and the gameplay , well it's a Farcry 3 clone and looks nowhere near as good. The story is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥ too and its broken as â¥â¥â¥â¥. Could it be good when they fix it?...no i can't.   pro's it passes the time   cons rubbish story a half arsed Farcry 3 gameplay unfinshed level design. yes thats right. i saw floating signs without any poles missing walls with half the terrain missing on the other side and a few missing textures. Floating people yep this is like a bad early access game. stiff face animations sometimes it like watch a badly acted emotionless b movie The background crowd voices are on a loop so they will eventually drive you â¥â¥â¥â¥ing crazy.

2768	1	a	Never before have I experienced such an awful, weird but utterly amazing game. This game really is so bad, itâs good.
2935	1	a	Deadly Premonition is a difficult thing to describe. Not at its core, but where it counts. Deadly Premonition is essentially Twin Peaks: the Video Game. So much so to the point where in its setting, characters, and major plot points are ripped almost directly from Twin Peaks. You are FBI special agent Francis York Morgan, tasked with finding the culprit behind the murder of a young woman in the small town of Greenvale that has some odd relation to a string of murders happening all across the country.   To preface this, I will simply say that Deadly Premonition: Directors Cut is one of the sloppiest, messy, and badly done PC ports for a game that is just not good. It has ransom crashes and even though people talk about CTD's (Crash To Desktop), the majority of crashes didn't even allow me to do that. The controls are clunky and the horror bits aren't as scary as they could be. Yet everything is done in such a way that it is just so absolutely amazing in every way. At its core, Deadly Premonition is one of my favorite games to play and is definitely one of my top ten games of all time. The weirdly written character dialogue backed up by one of the maybe 15 audio tracks that the game has to offer (but it's probably going to be Life Is Beautiful, who am I kidding) creates this setting that you just can't put down because you're so invested in the world it paints and the characters that accompany you on your investigation. Also it's just f****** weird in a great way.  TL;DR Even while the game is flawed in so many ways, all of its flaws contribute to an experience that every horror lover/movie lover/lover of David Lynch/person on this planet should partake in. The game is an absolutely amazing work of art that is only $2.50 during sales and totally worth the cash and the crashes.

2236	0	a	Good luck trying to customize your controls, cause if you do those keys will bind however some keys (like the middle mouse button and v) have secondary uses so you cant use these. Funnily enough it gives you the option turn of toggle ads but no option to toggle crouch or sprint so yeah have fun. because its default is toggle and i â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hate toggle run and crouch, i know that's my preferance but it's two thousand and â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sixteen and every game should give you the option to either toggle or hold.  Also: The game is a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥. stealth is an option but it is impossible to accomplish because enemies are at every single turn and very weirdly placed, for example: i tried sneaking into an enemy base and halfway through a bunch of my own guys spawned INSIDE the base and i literally saw them spawn on the minimap, compeltly â¥â¥â¥â¥ing that up. The game also feels very 'far cry' ish. Oh and don't forget the magical blimp that spawns enemies 'immersevly' 10m's away. And i feel like there is some hidden mouse acceleration or smoothing going on which always annoys the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of me. You don't even get to shoot anyone until about 30mins in. this especially looks bad comapared to doom, wherein it took a total of 15 seconds. i mean i know its got a story but for â¥â¥â¥â¥ sake at least but a little something to whet my appetite.   Overall i would NOT recommend this game. Wait for a sale and wait until its fixed cause it feels like a total cash-in. The graphics are all right and it worked pretty well on my gtx 970 but yeah thats about the only positive...

So far though i've been loving how the games plays out aside from the fact that my map was drawn by a 6-year-old and finding out what/how to kill the next subject is explained. They say you have to listen to the people around the house but they are very vague. It's like they took lessons from castlevania 2.   Aside from that though the games controls are pretty good and simple. Graphics aren't bad either aside from when some areas are too dark. All in all 7/10

2976	1	a	Deadly Premonition is one of the weirdest games ever. To give you a good analogy. Imagine if David Lynch wrote a brilliant script and gave it to Tommy Wiseau or Ed Wood to direct, then you would have a movie that would resemble this game. If this sounds like the most awesome movie ever, then you will probably enjoy Deadly Premonition. Ed Wood movies may be terrible, but their entertaining as ****.   Deadly Premonition is the brainchild of Hidetaka 'SWERY' Suehiro. I've read some interviews featuring SWERY and decided that he is completely bat**** insane and yet a genius at the same. This game went through development hell for 6 years and was almost cancelled 4 times. It seems like nobody on the team really knew how to program well, and the game was perhaps too ambitious for it's own good. When the game came out it was a broken mess. The graphics would have been good on the Dreamcast, the controls are so bad it feels like it has to be intentional(seriously, the car controls are so bad you'll have to play it to believe it), the voice acting is usally passible but can be cringe-worthy at times, the animations on the characters are laugable, the repetive yet catchy musical scores come on at the worst possible times, and despite the terrible graphics the game has horrendous performance issues. Apparently SWERY was actually shocked when critics proceeded to rip the game apart.  Despite all the games shortcomings, there were some people who loved it. Some thought the technical issues only added 'so bad it's good' charm of the game. And of course, the plot and writing of this game is brilliant, if not completely insane. It was obviously heavily influenced by the David Lynch's Twin Peaks. Many of the characters, including the main one, are completely bonkers. The main character Francis York Morgan always introduces himself by saying 'I'm Francis York Morgan, but just call me York, that's what everyone always calls me.' He constantly talks to his imaginary friend Zach. He says not to ask him about Zach, that's a 'private matter.' He literally tells his fortune by looking at the milk swirls in his coffee. To give you an idea of how crazy the writing in this game is *tiny spoiler ahead*, there's one part where a guy in a wheelchair with a skull mask and a gask mask on, who talks by whispering rhyming sentences to a translator, orders a bizzare sandwich in a restaurant. This sandwhich happens to be white bread and turkey, with strawberry jam and cereal(which appears to be corn flakes) smeared on top. York comments that this is a sinner's sandwhich, a sandwhich ones makes to punish themselves for their sins. The guy in the wheelchair challenges York to try this sandwich. After York tries it he jumps out of his chair in surprise, saying it's delicious and orders one. The expression on the two women's faces next to him is one of the moments that makes this game a masterpiece. BTW, you need to actually try the sinner's sandwich. I used Publix Italian Bread, Smucker's strawberry jam, deli turkey meat, and cornflakes. Putting the jam and corn flakes on top is ludicrous, so I just flipped the bread over. Surprisingly, it's delicous. I even made a second one after finishing the first one. SWERY says one of his starving college student friends actually made this, because he didn't have any money and those were the only ingredients he had. Too be honest, Americans put cranberry sauce and potato chips on sandwiches, so it's not too much of a stretch.  Slowly, but surely, just like the game NiER, Deadly Premonition gained gained a cult following. It did so for it's amazing writing and 'so bad it's good' gameplay. If you get this game, be aware that it may not even run properly and you might have to finish it by watching a let's play on youTube. SWERY actually apologized for this horrible port. However, there are a ton of fan patches out there to fix the problems. SWERY was flattered that the game had so much support that people would go to these lengths to make it playable. He said he wished he could hire some of the people who fixed his game. It might remind people of another cult game that was broken on release and had to be fixed by fan patches, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines. That also featured terrible gameplay, but a brilliant plot.  Definitely give this game a chance if you're a fan of cult classics. At least watch a let's play on youTube to experience the plot and bizarre characters. SWERY has also created a new game, D4, which is a lot less broken and features characters that are even more insane. Sadly, SWERY's games have failed to make any money(he released D4 on the Xbone and not the PS4 I mean, come on, the only thing Xboners play is Call of Duty), and he has taken some time off to recover from an illness but insists he'll be back. We can only hope. This guy is up there with Eric Wolpaw(Portal, Psychonauts, and Old Man Murray) as one of the industry's best writers, and it would be a shame to lose him.

2428	1	a	I'll admit, after reading initial reviews I had my doubts. But Homefront: The Revolution (H:TR) turned out great. If you're a fan of the Red Faction series of games then you'll fit right in.  H:TR is an open world FPS that sees you take on the role of Ethan Brady an eager recruit for the resistance movement in Phillidelphia. Needless to say shenanigans ensue as you capture locations to further your cause and stir up local populations into rebellion!  I had a blast with this and I didn't think I would! I loved every second of it! I was an American citizen, fighting to free my country, Hell yes!  I only encountered two things about the title I didn't like:  1) Lag despite vastly superior hardware. This was more of an annoyance than anything but still thought I should mention it. I run this game on the following:  Win 7 HP SP 1  AMD FX 6300 6 core  8GB RAM  NVIDIA Geforce 970  2) Dry Co-op. The cooperative 'Resistance Mode' sees you and four others tacle an objective against A.I. opponents. Through victory you earn money to buy weapons and attachments as well as level your own custom resistance fighter. Only down side is I was expecting something like a co-op campaign or something along those lines.  All in all 9/10 depite minor issues and lots of fun to be had!

313	0	a	An interesting game by a studio that dared to try something different. The final result is a rather linear, buggy experience that mostly has you running around a huge mansion hunting for clues or interactable objects that have to do with your current target. You'll mostly end up finding items you will need in later chapters, but you get to keep the items for later anyway. This makes the later killings much easier than the earlier ones, since you almost always already have a clue as to how you can use items A or B that your found 2 hours earlier for this. Not all solutions are particularly straightforward. Sometimes the clue you need is dropped in a single line at the start of a cutscene and is then never repeated again. ('Fetch us some [X] and turn on the [Z]!') Other times characters will not shut up and will give you one hint after the other. ('There's a CRUCIFIX in our BATHROOM!' *wink wink*)  The game is strongest about halfway through, when you've gotten used to the controls and the layout of the manor, and you're starting to experiment with your new powers. The later kills and especially the finale involve some sort of time pressure element, which was very unwelcome.  The finale itself is a buggy mess. The game crashed twice and bugged out three other times during the final 5 minutes of gameplay, all at seperate unrelated moments.  It's nice that you got to choose from two different finales, though (action or puzzle), but in the end neither was much of an enjoyment.  Get this game on sale only if you think you'd enjoy playing the antichrist riding around a giant manor on your tricycle, mostly hunting for clues and objects. Otherwise, don't bother.

People complaining about poor optimization and what not must have a pretty bad computer as i am able to keep my fps at or around 60 with an i7 and gtx 970. But, from what I have played so far, everything in the game is great and enjoyable in my opinon. The story is good, combat is great and the performance of the game is fine. So overall I would say that this game is great and worth it. Well, not $60 worth it but maybe $40 worth it.

264	0	a	I really can't recommend this game much (maybe with exception of buying it for a very very low price). There is so much of unused potential it is sad. The basic idea is great but the execution is sadly lacking in almost every way.  You could think that in Lucius you will be placed in an open playground that lets you experiment with using environment for your intentions while there will be dynamic reaction of other people on your actions. But that is completely wrong. Instead of that you are forced to kill your victims in one and only exact fashion. No place for creativity or multiple ways to do that.  And the game is so unpolished. There is a load of bugs and glitches from the smaller (items in characters hands tend to move awkwardly during cutscenes) to really problematic (that can force you to repeat the whole mission). I can overlook some problems but there are just to many of them to be such benevolent with Lucius.  Also the core gameplay mechanics are poorly designed. For example you have paranormal abilities which you can use to manipulate others. To use them you have to switch to them...but then you can't use anything (open doors, search through drawers etc.) as that is also a separate ability. Or later in game you get a chance to conjure fireballs but when you begin to cast them the effect will cover your sight and you will not see what's ahead of you. There are also some 'stealth' missions where you are forced to do them over and over again (and there are really long loadings) until you learn how to go through them step by step.  Well, Lucius is not a good game. But it is not so horrible as it can sound from my words either. The story is actually ok, the slowly deteriorating mental state of your family is for the most parts well done and the voice acting is nice. But the game has so many gameplay issues, bugs and other things. Also the replayability is almost none.

1668	1	a	Only get this on sale...  - Controls are really wonky: you walk around like a drunk guy, the aiming is off and changes sometimes without you doing anything (I jumped down a building without moving twice)... You will lose most of your bullets trying to aim correctly (not aiming gives you a higher succesrate)... Trying to center something to open with E often results in taking the viewpoint away from that spot and being unable to open it...  - Like a lot of 'action'-games these days it starts off with several cinematics you can not scip followed by a 'walking' mission. The game only starts after 15 minutes.  + idea of the gameplay is ok, without the problems stated above, it would have been a great game.
263	1	a	Lucius is a game for those who enjoy (somewhat) brutally murdering members of their household in the form of a 6-year-old son of Satan. The graphics are fairly well done (in my opinion) and you have the option to customise the controls to suit you. As for the voice acting, there's not much to say. They did a good job and they worked well in the games setting. My only real issue (though it isn't much of one) would be the lack of an option to save. If you got caught, you had to start the level (next murder, they appear to save after each one) from the beginning which can be a hassle if your PC dies on you or you need to attend urgent business. Overall, I'd say it's a decent and well-done game by Shiver that I suggest buying if you like bloodshed as there can be some pretty surprising and nasty deaths along the line, all organised by one little boy. Lucius.
1910	0	a	this game is very fun for the first 5 hours or so but i got very bored once i got all the guns and everything in the first 5 hours the story is above average and is the only thing that makes me want to keep playing but i just can't go blind to the cons like the bad ai and the stupid amount of guns i didn't count but i think there are 6 or 7 maybe 8 i feel very sad that this game was a flop as i loved the first homefront and everything about it the nice amount of guns the pretty nice graphics the muiltiplayer which was kinda like battlefield with tanks and large maps and just all around fun and i wish home front the revolution had some kind of pvp aspect like i understand the resistance don't have a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ amount of tanks but that is what would of map it have more life if the norks had access to the drones and all the things in the game but they don't have the gear that the resistance has like the hacking device and all that good stuff and they also have the white armour for normal infantry so they would be easy to spot but they have better guns then the resistance so it would be a very fun mode of muiltiplayer if not that maybe like some kind of 5v5 or 10v10 modes where the norks half to find the resistance fighters in the crouds of people and they can control drones and scan people search people all while the resistance fighters are blowing up the APCs and doing what you do in the main game the game would then have alot more players and a longer life span i did buy this game before it was on free weekend and do not reccommend

Huge map with lots of secrets to find, some interesting characters to meet and a decent story.

3028	1	a	Let me say this right away, I've not finished Knytt Underground nor do I plan to. Yet, I can safely say it's an amazing platformer and very well put together. I got until the last chapter by myself but after exploring most of the rooms I just couldn't bother to exploring every single one of them so I just went on Youtube and saw a walkthrough from where I was until the end and I loved it. While at first glance Knytt Underground may look like just another puzzle platformer amongst the many others that have came out on recent years, it's not. Knytt Underground tells a story, a very strange story that will only make sense by the end of the game. The story is told in a hidden way, just like an hidden message and there are places online where you can see peoples explanations of the story in case that's the only thing that interests you. Besides that, Knytt Underground is a very well made platformer, very fluid, responsive controls, possibly Super Meat Boy level of controls along with some minor teleport and flying mechanics. The soundtrack on this game is nothing short of amazing, very calm and charming along with the brilliant visuals that decorate the background and they vary alot from level to level. Overall, it's pretty safe to say that you can't go wrong with Knytt Underground, either if you're looking for a great platformer or for a great story, it is an incredibly well made game.

2846	1	a	I love this game, it is one of the few games I have gotten all achievements with and I'm playing it all over again. Yes, there are holes, mighty big ones in fact, but it actually makes the game shine.   Here's a list as to why it sucks: Crashes often Plot is barely explained Plot holes Graphics are terrible Controls (on the xbox) are weird (LB to sprint?) [Also if you are playing with an xbox controller DO NOT I repeat DO NOT change the buttons, it does not work with the new scheme] Sound effects are weird and confusing at times (Squirrels make monkey noises apparently) Voices are not that great (What's with the reverb?) Hit boxes are confusing for both character and enemies (I got the lazer sword and cannot use it because of the hit boxes and because I get grappled too often) Weapons are okay (Some are difficult for me to use) AI is weird Slow spawning (for the Hell Dogs that is...) Car controls are abysmal (I can do a 360 in the air both forwards and sideways) There's a bar for everything (sleep, food, health and stamina you have monitor and if you like to be clean shaven, you have to watch your beard too (shame that you can't fully grow it out))  And there's more I probably forgot about, but this game got me hooked. I don't personally like horror games, but this one I just loved. One of the many things I loved about this game is that everybody had CHARACTER. It actually felt like meeting a real person, nobody's persona is baseless and everybody has a story, a secret, a dream and reasons for being the way that they are.   Terrible game but it's 10/10 for me!

The concept is interesting, the graphics and soundtrack are quite good, the gameplay is great and the story is intriguing. Despite all the controversy surrounding this game for obvious reasons, I still recommend it. It's nice to play the bad person for once in a video game, that is what makes Lucius refreshing. The music is creepy enough to set the tone of the game and the controls are easy to use. Go buy it if you want to play it, I had a fun time with it, and I believe you won't be disappointed

1764	0	a	  Sadly while I want to recommend this game, I just can't at this point in time. I read with anticipation all the reviews stating that the latest patches had fixed all the problems. I was one of the apparently few people who really liked the first Homefront game a few years ago so I eagerly awaited this.  However, for me, this is still broken. I can play it for about 10 minutes and then it freezes, locks up and I have to stop it from the Task Manager. The frame rates are usually ok but occasionally lag pretty bad which speaks volumes about how unoptimized this game is given I'm running it on a GTX 980, plenty of grunt for 1080p gaming.  I think this will be a great game if the dev's keep working on it but right now I just can't recommend it.
508	1	a	It's one of those games whereby the murders are all scripted and all you have to do as the player is to follow said script. It's disappointing in that aspect but other than that, it's an interesting concept and a decent game to play. I'd advise to get it when it's on sale.

557	1	a	Lucius brings back the fun I remember from playing early sandbox games. The 'Story' portion of the game which takes you from start to finish is very linear. But I found a lot of times I was content to use the house as a playground for Lucius's powers instead of always immediately targeting my next victim. The game also somewhat obviously boasts quite a violent streak, almost to the point of it suffering from how extreme they are compared to the subtly in the story from the detectives perspective, and how the characters seem to nonchalantly react after 4 or 5 gruesome deaths. The game also feels a little short, even with mucking about this game is not in it for the long haul at all and with the linear story having almost no replayability that is a bit of a down-note for Lucius. Bottom Line: definitely worth getting, if it's on sale.
1317	1	a	Zombie Driver HD's relatively low price point and reasonable replay value make it easy to recommend, so long as you aren't expecting something of full retail quality.
2745	1	a	its a masterpiece  ignore the people who say the game is unfinishable btw, the port is far from a masterpiece but apart from the memory leak it runs with few problems, seriously, people are just too lazy to do any fixes and just say avoid. also back up your save at chapter 9

1950	1	a	I want to be brief and open. This game was not as good as I hoped it would be. I still recommend it if the idea excites you. I loved the first Homefront. This was not as good. I have not played it since the first month after it came out - it was glitchy, but fun. I had fun playing this game. That's what games are for.
940	1	a	I liked the game:  Good: A really different game than what I am used to. Dark story, with creative ways of gaming. Bit forced (linear), especially locked doors that shouldn't be locked. Murdering people in different way is fun anyway!  Mum stalks me! (is that good xD?).  Bad: I don't know how to explain this without spoiling, but some things you are supposed to do at some point, aren't really that easy. Playing this for 40 hours achievement? NOPE! 20 hours? I don't think so.

1442	1	a	First thing: I got this for .99 cents so the bar for 'good bargain' is very low...  That said, Zombie Driver HD is a pretty nice game: I am not even halfway through the main campaing, but between slaughters and tournaments I can't say I didn't had quite some fun, let's say 3-4E tier fun ;-)  The basics are quite simple: you drive a car with weapon mounts, and go around wrecking havoc on all zombies with the misfortune of crossing your path.  There is a campaign, where the developer feels obliged to give us a justification for shooting and running over things until they are turned into a red pulp, there is a number of tournaments with multiple disciplines, like:  * Race, where you should theoretically drive fast, but instead you end up doing everything but that, otherwise the adversaries cheat and win all the time * Endurance, a race where you drive a car rigged to a bomb and where for balancing reasons killing zombies is more important than driving fast * Eliminator, where you actually have to kill your adversaries to win, so at least for once you get to do what you are supposed to  and then there is the 'slaughter mode', where you just run over zombies for as long as you can, for those who find the campaing and tournaments too sophisticated.  The game is not perfect: as I said, the competitors cheat all the time for balancing reasons (as in the plain races, where otherwise it would be too easy to win) or to make the game more fun (e.g. in eliminator they defy all laws of time and space, appearing first in front of you, then behind, ecc... just to offer you more targets) and the campaing is kind of meh, but it's a total win for 99c and a nice game for less than 4E, so if you get it on sale, it definitely is worth a shot.
2422	0	a	Uninspired gameplay and graphics that are on-par with other titles but don't stand out hamper my enjoyment Homefront: The Revolution. Unfortunately, it doesn't compensate by capitalizing on its somewhat novel story: America is now subject to rule by North Korea, and you are part of an insurgency fighting them. The game tries to pass off what you're doing and people's suffering, but just fails. I never felt involved with the characters. Attempts to portray Americans in the ghettos as oppressed fell flat, just the developers trying to inject emotion. The worst were the constant radio updates from resistance members that sounded just so chipper to go out scouting when they're supposed to be pariahs suffering at the hands of this dictatorship. Ugh, just the worst.

2981	1	a	I don't even know where to begin to describe this. This is probably the worst PC port in the history of ports (even worse than Dark Souls). It crashes constantly and has little glitches here and there. That's not even touching upon the absolutely horrendous combat and driving mechanics. But hell if this wasn't one of the most unique games I've ever played. And the story is one of the best I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing in a game, and for that alone I'd recommend this game over a hell of a lot of other titles. If it's on sale and you think you can stomach the little fixes and mods you'll need to actually run it, you might just love it. Otherwise, pick up the more stable PS3 or Xbox 360 versions.

155	1	a	Before the DOTA/MOBA games really took off commercially (i.e before HoN, LoL, DotA2, etc) Demigod lept onto the bandwagon and bought with it really nice graphics and fast paced action.  Unfortunately the game bombed, it came out too early in the fad when the original DotA had such a strong fan base that people passed by this game. But the thing is that it's a good game, it looks great, the classes are varied (even if there are only about 10 character choices), and it's pretty deep. Unlike other MOBA games Demigod allows you to not only spend money on your hero and his items, but upgrade your towers, nexus/castle, even minion waves.   It has a bunch of unique elements but it let down by the fact it never got the promised expanded champion roster, making this a game fun for LANs (until DotA2 released officially) but not for online play. Plus it's cheap!
2893	1	a	time is a flat circle

305	1	a	While the premise for Lucius is full of promise and a refreshing take on horror, Lucius spends more time aggravating than rewarding you with some truly nagging nuisances, questionable execution, and general inconsistencies. You play Lucius, a formidable six year-old child. Born on the 6th of June, 1966 (you can do the conversion), Lucius has the honor of being the anti-Christ and all the light-hearted responsibilities that come with it. Visited by his dad on Birthday number six, Lucius is tasked with carrying out the whims of his father: murdering all the inhabitants of Dante Manor.  The game is comprised of nine separate chapters. Each begins with a voice-over and a notebook entry on who your next target is, and concludes with a grisly homicide and a follow-up visit from Satan to grant Lucius new powers and to bolster old ones, such as telekinesis, combustion, and mind-control. While many of the kills are creative, entertaining, and sometimes morbidly funny, what the game often requires of you to reach that moment of satisfaction often results in frustration.  As an anti-hero six-year-old Satan spawn, youâre quite the amalgam of bad-â¥â¥â¥ and unsuspected hitman â but without much motive or directive. Each kill requires you to piece together sporadic clues to determine what items or tools are necessary to manipulate your target or lure them into places they might not otherwise go (such as face-first into a stove top element to light a cigarette).  For those who enjoy all aspects of the discovery process, clicking around in different environments and ultimately finding what youâre looking for can be rewarding â although the emotion I frequently experienced was exasperation. With little feedback that youâre on the right course, the game can quickly stop being fun. Because of each missionâs strict requirements, the intended payoffs act more as a relief to pent-up frustration for finally getting it right. There was nothing more disappointing than going into the kitchen and being unable to pick up the butcher knife. The mission requirements are often unclear, as almost the entire mansion is free to roam from murder one. Further, there is no initial tutorial on the sequential nature of your murderous imperatives, so youâll need to start clicking early, often, and indiscriminately. Where the frustration often comes in is when youâre desperately trying to find the next required item to trigger the next scripted sequence or dialogue, so you can in turn use that clue to get down to business. The Manor is highly-detailed, huge and pretty much unrestricted in accessibility from the beginning. This gives you room to explore, but sometimes finding the necessary tools necessitates a click-fest of drawers, cabinets, and items lying around, until you find what you need. The game is plagued with some annoying glitches, clipping problems and hit detection, breaking the flow of the narrative (like characters getting stuck, objects flying around mysteriously and unpredictably after manipulating them, or the camera auto-moving to a 1st-person perspective when near a wall, which is quite jarring).  Graphically, the game isnât ugly, but a lot of the colors are washed out, the lighting is unrealistic and interferes with other sources (like the outside light interacting with ambient light), and the animations are jerky. The cutscenes are entertaining but suffer from poor camera placement and direction. Subtracting from the presentation are the unacceptably long load times. This compounds frustration when occasionally youâll fail a mission because someone may have seen you wielding a screwdriver that you had no business wielding, or overtly using your telekinesis, drawing attention from those around. There are no waypoints, so if you fail, youâre back at the beginning, but first youâll be staring at a load screen.  The in-game music features some fun, weird, bugle-filled atmospheric tracks, sometimes employing the cellos, violin crescendos, and orchestral choirs that are common of the horror genre. Sadly, the music is often on short loops, and can get annoying or simply feel out of place during parts of the chapters. Speaking about out of place, the gameâs voice acting is B-rate at best, suffering at times from a poorly-translated script and inadequate direction. This was especially disappointing due to the game being heavily story-driven and reliant on verbal or conversational cues that felt detached.  Despite the gameâs ambitious premise, its many shortfalls overshadow the things it actually does well. The murders are always a treat. Coupled with Luciusâ deadpan death-stare and the ludicrously lavish and ridiculous ways in which targets reach their bloody ends, there is often a sick, dark humor that pervades the game. This is also apparent among the surviving residents and workers as theyâre picked off one by one, slowly slipping into depression or insanity, and little Lucius just stands there, taking in all the madness, while still conducting his everyday business of putting away his toys and brushing his teeth (these are sadly further nuisances â chores â that break up the narrative but add to the hilarity). The entire game takes place at Dante Manor, an enormous, sprawling estate with dozens of rooms to explore, drawers to rifle through, and objects to steal for your nefarious ends. While the ultimate demise of each target is often original and unpredictable, reaching that moment typically mimics a âTake object A to manipulate object B to get target C to do task Dâ. As such, there is little freedom in getting to the end result. This is not a sandbox game and does not follow the open-ended format of, for example, the Hitman and Manhunt series â but that difference isnât necessarily a flaw, as it serves a purpose by bolstering the narrative.  Lucius can be engrossing, charming, and even darkly funny. Sadly, the game is bogged down by its poor execution, inconsistent atmosphere, buggy levels, and monotonous mission objectives. If you enjoyed The Omen series (which this game generously borrows from), then you might find something to like in Lucius. Its unsatisfying ending, that despite leaving many questions unanswered, at least leaves the option open for a sequel that is perhaps more refined, tighter, and better-executed. 6/10

1255	1	a	I bought this game way back before it was on steam and enjoyed it. Was pleasently surprised to see it on sale recently and decided to buy it, even though I have the original version of the game. Well worth the purchase. Graphics are updated, as well as parts of the story and gameplay. You drive around running over and shooting zombies. What else do you need? Great for killing time when you don't feel like playing a big in-depth game. Worth the couple of bucks I paid for the complete edition.

It also has a great weapon costimization process and it is insanely fun to use the flame launcher in groups of large enemies.

1597	1	a	The game was recently up for a free weekend, and despite the mixed reviews, I enjoyed the game enough to purchase it on sale. All in all I think there's a lot to enjoy here. First the bad - the noted frame rate drops, and the occasional minor bug typical of open world games - NPCs mispathing, or blocking doors or staircases; a few minor missteps when jumping or looting, etc., and some audio bugs with speeches playing over each other, but over all there were no game breaking bugs and no crashes or freezes at all.  The good - in terms of gameplay, the story and world gameplay both unfold nicely. The open world setting works very well for the style of game - some areas start out clean and pristine, and there's a good mix of stealth gameplay and action as you move throughout the zones, sabatoging and taking on random events and exploration. As you progress the citizens around you start to rise up, attacking guards, spraypainting walls, etc. You see the effects of your progress on the world and it helps create a lot of immersion.  In terms of mechanics, the gunplay is average - there are some fairly bullet spongey enemies, but you're able to upgrade your weapons in order to reduce that. AI is decent - enemies will take cover and throw grenades, but they're fairly same-ish for the most part. There's not a massive variety of weapons, but it makes sense in the context of the game world. Ambushing patrols with remote explosives is a lot of fun and definitely makes you feel like you're playing the part of a revolutionary.  The story and voice acting are acceptable and move the action forward but they're not winning any awards. Graphics are good and it runs well on older hardware, aside from the aformentioned frame rate drops, which seem to occur regardless of your specs.   Overall if you get this game on sale, it's a good time and I found myself wanting to play more. Unfortunatly any online play seems to be dead, but I bought this mainly for single player and it lived up to my expectations.

2926	1	a	It's hard to objectively define Deadly Premonition. Perhaps it's a game so bad that it's somehow good. Perhaps it's a game intentionally bizarre and profound which is rough around the edges. Either way, it's not a forgettable game. That much is certain.  If I tried to review it on it's merits, the review would come across overly negative - the simple reason being it lacks them. Graphically it's poor. The soundtrack is forgettable. The gameplay is fairly boring. The controls are pretty bad. The constant onslaught of driving from place to place is dull. I could go on.  Despite this, the plot while hardly a masterpiece is just weird enough to keep you hooked. The protagonist is curiously unusual and his supporting cast unpredictable. All things considered, the game rarely goes where you expect it to, breaking most of it's tropes and keeping things fresh. It's suffice to say you'll keep playing just to see what crazy sh*t Deadly Premonition pulls next.  That is, if you can make it work. The PC port is nothing short of awful. In order to get a smooth experience, you'll need mods. At minimum, DPFix should be used. For a more solid, enjoyable experience, you can use some texture mods and SweetFX. The game is also full of bugs. I had to launch the game from the main exe as the launcher was incapable of doing so. I also had to patch the game to be large-address aware due to a fairly aggressive memory leak. I'd also strongly recommend a gamepad. Even after all this, the game still has a number of issues, but it's certainly playable.   So, do I recommend Deadly Premonition? I'd say yes, but barely. Pick it up cheap and hope to heck you can make it work. If so, you're in for a wild ride... for better or for worse.

1637	1	a	Bought this game for around $23 when it was on sale. That's a fair price. I had fun playing this game, but I doubt I would play it again. The atmosphere and graphics were on point. As the game is now, my GTX 770/i5/16gb rig ran it maxed out at ~45-60fps with no noticable performance issues. There were some bugs and glitches in regards to gunplay, and some NPCs would magically disappear, but it was hardly game-breaking, just made me question the normal $40 price point. The voice acting and writing were a bit off, but the storyline was interesting enough for an FPS.  This game is a bit repetitive, but the different control point objectives are different and varied enough that at least I felt engaged for every little battle. I tell my friends this is a mashup of Assassin's Creed and Far Cry, with some Fallout-level destruction thrown in there. Running around the 'Red Zone', shooting snipers, then running to a different position while avoiding air ships was fun. And seeing a guard abusing a civilian and slitting that guard's throat was satisfying.   All in all, I'd give this game a 7/10 for the $20 sale price. It'd be 6/10 if I paid full price.  Tl;dr: Wait for the game to go on sale.

1114	1	a	When I bought this game I thought it'd be a quick little indy game that only lasted an hour or so. In reality it's pretty long for the price, and really fun. I got this and part two for 6 bucks in a steam sale, though i'd have been happy had i paid 20. Nice graphics if you care about that sort of thing, and well put together. So far I haven't had any problems with glitches and such either. I like this game a lot and it's pretty creative when it comes to how you kill your targets. It's dark, sinister, and you really feel like a creepy little devil child. It almost feels similar to a less complex hitman game, though instead of an assassin you're a devil child with a few satanic powers.
1802	1	a	You will play as Tom Brady with â¥â¥â¥-kicking skills--Yeah he dashes and runs pretty good  A FarCry-like game in a more violent way.  No need to know the stories and all those characters, just shut up and blow some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ up  Would recommend it if you get to buy the entire game at $17.99, worth it!
2067	1	a	I have spent a few hours playing this and I love the campain. Good Story grest cutscenes. I framrate issues would be niced if they were fixed. I get well over 60 but I can watch my frames just dip in and out. I am ver sad that there is no pvp for this game. I loved the onld homfront pvp and was very sad that they did not include it. They do have onlione co-op but there are allot if network issues and its very hard to find other players to play with.  I would rate this game 6 out of 10 stars and so low becuse of the lack of PVP for a game that was built for it. I would say if you want a game that you would like to blow stuff up and shoot people and save people then this is your game.   Good Game but could have done better.

2257	0	a	They wrecked a good game by making it open world. Simple as that.
1121	0	a	Lucius is an compelling complete mess of a game that sadly manages to sour itself right at the end.  The game is a point and click game where you play as Lucius, a 6 year old millionare child that for some reason is in leagues with Satan, and is tasked to kill the other people in his house discretely to harvest their souls. Everything in the game takes place within the giant open family mansion where you have to gather clues, find items and do your chores to figure out the solutions to puzzles involving killing people in more or less creative ways.  This is all conveyed in the style of a 70's B-horror movie akin to The Exorcist, only it seems to be somewhat aware (or charmingly unaware) of the goofyness of the situation and cranks up the cheese to hillarious degrees, with overuse of 666 symbolism, slow motion head explosions and cartoonishly unlikable house residents to murder. The game's attempts at horror falls incredibly flat out of the gate in other words, though it do manage to be bloody hillarious instead which is what got me hooked through the entire thing.  Because the thing is, the game itself is not very good. A lot of the time you are given very vague hints of what to do and it ends up with tons of walking around the house searching for interactive items, the magic powers you get such as levitation and mind control only seems to want to work half of the time, there is some horrible early 2000's license game style sneaking sections, and the final boss fight was completely broken for me until I reloaded a save. The game also has ludicrous loading times even on high end computers, and it looks like an upscaled PS2 game in a lot of regards despite seeming to use a surprising ammount of power to run.  However along with those bad things are a lot of fun 'bad' things too. The physics engine is super wonky and makes doors and objects flip out at times, which is especially apparent with the ragdoll physics going into full Goat Simulator mode whenever they happen outside of cutscenes (if you get hold of the gun earlier than intended you can have a lot of fun with this). You can unlock a tricycle to help move around the house quicker, which breaks the laws of physics around stairs and other things. You sometimes spawn mid air or partway underground when starting a mission. Lots of weird unintended wacky things that is really funny whenever it do happen.  The truly bad parts really do tear it down a lot though, so even if I did enjoy big chunks of this game in a Troll 2 sort of way, the truly abysmal parts dragged it way too much down to outright recommend it. If you are interested in so bad it's good horror cheese and physics wackyness, grab it on a sale, but stay away at the current full price.

844	0	a	It doesn't really give you free roam and the puzzles it wants you to solve can only be done one way and that way is the most annoying because you have to wait until your victim gives you hits like 'I'ma go fix the piano.' Not worth asking price. I believe I paid 5 dollars for it on sale. I'd wait for that again.   (Edit) now that I think about it, it was actually a gift... But it was on sale for 5 dollars at one point.
1478	1	a	Update after finishing the game:  I have to bump the overall score down to 6/10 :( I don't want to spoil anything for those considering buying this game but mehhhhhhh on the ending. The game was still hours and hours of fun but it almost feels like they rushed the plot to ship the game in time. It was probably the most un-interesting, short-sighted, predictable ending of any video game, ever.   Also I found something that really helped performance big time about half-way through. Put the object detail at medium. I could hardly tell any difference between medium and very high, and I was able to max everything else out and play with a pretty much locked 60fps @ 2715x1527 which looks considerably better than 1080p. And oddly runs much better than 1.5x supersampling in-game.  Good try Dambuster - hopefully you'll have some great lessons learned from all of the user feedback and will make a truly great game if there's a sequel.    Original review:  I waited 10 hours to post my review because I wanted to give HF:R a fighting chance.  Short version:   7/10 - I say buy it Pros: Actually pretty damn fun so far Cons: GPU utilization/frame pacing issues reminiscent of Fallout 4  Long version:  Maybe my version of a fun FPS is different from 99% of the world, but I'm actually really enjoying this game. Considering DeepSilver/DB inherited a POS bankrupt title that was tossed back and forth for 4 years like a red-headed high school cheerleader, I think the results are pretty great.  Sure, there are some framepacing issues, GPU utilization problems, and yes theres some points where it's sort of mindboggling that basic features arent there (hello...cough... save game), but the overall presentation is pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ good and enjoyment is high. Maybe I'm weird... but I was compelled to write a review in favor of this game after seeing so many bad reviews before playing it.   All I've seen are reviews saying how disasterous the performance is. I also see the majority of reviews saying the gameplay is bland, combat is weak, stealth system sucks, graphics are underwhelming, on and on and on. I disagree with those for the most part too. I swear people are way too critical. Here's my take:  Stealth: 7/10 - If it had better cover mechanics, or even the ability to lean from cover, it would be 8 Combat: 7/10 - it does feel a little sluggish at times, but I turned auto-aim off Graphics: 6/10 - compared to Division or UC4, which have set a new bar for graphics these days Enjoyment 8/10 - despite the lower scores above, for some reason this game is totally pulling me in, its fun! Performance: 5/10 - see below Story: 5/10 Value: 7/10  The only real major flaw I see so far is a GPU utilization problem. A 6700k/980ti combo should be able to run a Dying Light clone (essentially what this game feels and looks like to me) at a resolution of 2715x1527 @ max settings and achieve a locked 60fps with about 90-95% GPU utilization. With HF:R it's nowhere even close to that. I'm able to get 55-60 fps @ 1920x1080 but it only uses about ~65% of the GPU to do so.   If I step it even 1 notch above 1080p, or use supersampling at all, framerates become wildly unstable - as does the GPU utilization. Even at 1080p there are a few very rare and unexplainable dips into the high 40s. Every time it happens the GPU util actually drops to around 30-50%, almost as if something's choking the bandwidth. Actually, it's a similar symptom to Fallout 4. Even with the necessary hardware to run it at 2k DSR max settings, the game just couldn't keep up with the draw calls - showing the signs of an aging engine I suppose.  But to note: the frame rate issue (for me anyway) is very infrequent ... maybe 3-4 times in the 10 hours I've played. I think it's a minor nuisance. The rest of the time it's a pretty stable 60fps using ~65% GPU at max settings. Good enough to be enjoyable.  Anyway - I don't understand what's with all the hate. It's a fun game and a killer concept with only minor performance issues. If they fix the framerate issues I'd even go so far as to give it a 7.5 out of 10. If you're on the fence but enjoyed Dying Light, I'd say buy it. You'll probably enjoy this game. It's kind of like a mix of DL and Division... sorta. Maybe wait until it goes on sale, which with the number of negative reviews sadly, probably won't take very long.  Specs:  I6700k Gigabyte G1 980ti 64gb Dominator Pro DDR4 950 Evo NVME Asus Hero Viii

1711	1	a	I've been enjoying Homefront: The Revolution a lot, actually picked up the season pass bundle after playing it over the free weekend. The game runs great on my i7-6700k / 970 rig, something I can not say of the new Deus Ex, and it looks pretty incredible too, good use of stylized realism. You're probably not going to see major elements here which haven't been done in other games, but the games that it's borrowing from - Far Cry, Dying Light, Assassin's Creed, and a touch of Deus Ex - are all great and those elements are still fun, while being wrapped up in a new story and new world.  As far as bugs, I've seen some z-fighting, a crash, been detected through a wall (very frustrating when it brings endless waves of soldiers on you through no fault of your own), plenty of object alignment issues (c'mon guys, fix this) and the companion AI is absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥; but the bugginess is no worse than I'm used to seeing in AAA games. The developers deserve props for sticking out a rocky launch and actually (mostly) fixing the game.  I can't speak to what it was like at release, and I don't doubt that things were bad, but right now I definitely give Homefront: The Revolution a thumbs up. It's a good open world FPS that clicked with me very quickly and I'm looking forward to playing through the rest of the game.

1407	1	a	This remake gives the player everything what a good remake needs to. Better graphics, added gameplay elements with extended storyline (awesome new vehicles and boss battles), while keeping everything what made the original so entertaining, so if you enjoyed the original game or the demo of this version, give it a try!  Also this review was written some time ago and in the earlier version I was complaining about the really frustating (minutes length) loading times, BUT it seems like that the developers have fixed this issue with the DLC releases, so Thank You dev people for not letting this awesome experience be ruined by some stupid glitch. Now I can actually enjoy playing the game without worrying about that loading back the main menu will take effing 5 minutes.  P.S.: You can also drive a tank (not always of course, that'd be way too easy) to wade through the hordes of zombies. If THIS can't convince you, nothing will.

2093	1	a	Co-Op is a lie. 'HomeFront: The Revolution' is tagged as Co-Op but the Campaign is single-player only and the co-op mentioned is an added section to play a couple of short missions together. If you want real co-op then you need something like Borderlands, or Call of Duty III; those give Campaign Co-Op.  The game overall is pretty fun but has several bugs, like AI that constantly turns its back on you, or marked missions pieces that you can't do, or a map that doesn't remove something you've already accomplished. Hoping these bugs will be fixed in the near future though.  It uses the CryEnging and plays a lot like FarCry 4 but on a much smaller map, not as open world, but in a city environment. If you are looking for something like that then it should scratch the itch.  I can't really recommend for or against it and would sit on the fence on this one. But Steam requires you to Thumbs up or Down, they don't offer a sideways, so I'll go with an up since there is nothing majorly wrong with it.
1864	0	a	I was reminded of this game about 12 hours before it came out. I purchased in haste after reading a brief overview of the Game, and as soon as I saw 'Crytek Engine' I made my purchase.   I regret that decision. It's not the worst game in the world, but the fact they are charging $60 for this unfinished, buggy title is a bit dissapointing.   Graphically, not terrible, but it performs poorly even on sufficient hardware. They are supposedly supposed to improve this with upcoming patches, if so then this game is not bad in the Graphics department, but a lot of Texture work is subpar. You can tell they cut a lot of corners on this to get it out there. Lighting and overall 'look' still trump CoD IMO, which still looks like the first Modern Warfare with better Textures and lighting. That series also suffers from performance issues.   Gameplay is very basic. A lot of control point missions, nothing fancy. AI isn't great. In the end you basically run around shooting stuff, taking over bases. If that's enough to keep you occupied then you aren't going to find much else to do. It's the same stuff they've been putting out for 10+ years. Also, there's 1 vehicle, and it's a Dirt Bike. Nothing special, it gets you from Point A to Point B.  I'm not going to hold a grudge against the Developers, as they were put in a crappy situation. They may still redeem themselves with future Addons\Updates, but at this time I can't recommend this game at it's current price point. I just purchased the Original Ghost Recon Series for $10 on sale and I will probably get a lot more play time from those games.   -Justin

1626	0	a	Surprise, Homefront sequel is as good as the first. Which with how buggy, poorly written, horribly designed, and cheaply advertised as it was, meant that the bar to do better was set lower than qualifications needed to enroll into ITT Tech. Yet the developers did it, they managed to slide over that bar by making the game visually appealing, and that's about it. Sound design is out of sync, the voice actors seem uninterested, if you listen close enough you can hear their agents writing out their checks over the sound of monotone gunfire. The story is weaker than a polio stricken childs legs, with the US having given the keys to their military to North  Korea...why?  Because they made cool phones and apps. Your character doesn't talk as well, so you're basically Yes man Mario, with strong political views. Which with how the story plays out is really out of place. Questioned if you're a spy for the North Koreans, your lack of response clearly means you're not, and so you're trusted with every detail of the underground rebel fighters hide outs, weaknesses, locations, etc.  Outside of the story and sound, the Ai is terrible as well. You can be in the middle of a warzone running around with your gun out, but a few feet away a military patrol can be standing idly swapping kimchi recipes completely ignoring you. Taking out enemy stronghold points for your 'resistance' to take over is pretty simple as well. Walk into an area and shotgun enemies in the face as they frantically run around suffering Stormtrooper syndrome by missing most of their shots. Probably would have had more trouble firing a shotgun into a barrel of gerbils than I did taking on any of the threats in this game.  If the first game was supposed to be inspired by the movie Red Dawn, Homefront: The Revolution is more like watching Patrick Swayze die of pancreatic cancer.

It's sad that it didn't get as many attention as it shoudlve had, leading to the an early abandonment of the game by the devs. I got to say though that even with only 10 heroes, this game feel fresh and very diversed. Needless to say that this is the best looking MOBA, even after all those years.   I'd recommend this game to anyone who want to take a little break from the big two (LoL and DotA2). It's worth the money!

220	0	a	  It's really meh. A brawler game for kids, with very little content. Like 4 animated models grand total, plus some generic assets, set on a tiny map.
2173	1	a	Note that at the time of this review I had only played the campaign and therefore this review will focus on that and no this will not have any spoliers in terms of actual story.  Pros: Good weapon customisation  Very good campaign in terms of detail and story  Runs reasonably well on my PC and only had a couple of drops during the campaign (I know that some people have had problems with fps drops)  The easy difficulty is not a I win option in terms of difficulty and still offers a good challenge.  The health system is very good and definitiely adds to the challenge of the game.  Mixed (Things that were good and bad)  Good overall background story although disappointed that it was changed from the story in the original Homefront but I understand why it happened.  Although free to explore in the zones, I thought it would be truely open world like GTA V and that it seems to feel linear even though you can take over strongholds etc.  The A.I aren't idiots but they are not exactly the sharpest tools in the box either.  Cons:  Last part of the game becomes linear and back to the original homefront and other FPS games  Use of the RC car is quite bad and can be troublesome on things such as stairs  Campaign is quite short but longer then the original. I completed this campaign in about 15 hours.  Overall rating: 63/100  Not going to win any awards but it is definitely better then the first Homefront. I would get it when it is on sale if you don't want to pay Â£40 for it.

I've played close to maybe an hour of it so far and I can say it's everything I wanted it to be. The dialogues are ripe with exposition for paragraphs on end, the tone of which is lavishly crafted to be equal parts melodramatic and faustian at once. You're introduced as a detective of sorts, sent to help the church find, accuse and try heretics. The 'bishop' type you are sent to meet tells you about the process of doing so, which I'm sure will be a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing gloriously complicated mechanic that will provide hours of harsh entertainment.   The aesthetic of it is so pleasingly dark, not deppressingly or overwhelmingly so, but very dull green, light brown; beautiful in a dreary sort of way. It's got the feel that Diablo 2 had for me back in the day. In fact that's not a bad comparison. It's like a literary Diablo 2, taking more cues from historical events (like, say, the Inquisition) than high fantasy.   One criticism I might level at it is that tooltips could be more prevalant. I like complicated systems in my games, but I also like to know how to use them. A developer shouldnt play the game for you, but they should at least throw you an instruction manual. But that's it. Even the display issues are given a pass by me, because it's so damn cool.  I might feel compelled to change my opinion once I've played further, but as of now, I've got a thorough erection for this game.

2739	1	a	Now I'm not going to lie to you, the gameplay in this game is trash. Serious trash. You are cemented to the floor while shooting, there are only 2/3 different types of enemy in the game, sound effects are awful, the driving is hilariously bad as you fly around at 80mph spinning in circles and it crashes so much that you'll want to cry after the 10th time.  BUT, it's still a damn awesome game. How the heck does it manage that you ask? With some of the most hilarious dialogue I've heard in a video game and some of the most interesting and fleshed out characters which feel like they could actually exist in the real world, which doesn't really happen too often in video games.  If you can look past the gameplay issues and immerse yourself in the stories and the characters, you'll definitely have an amazing time.

1173	1	a	You play as Lucius a little boy who receives orders from the Devil himself ordering you to kill various people in the mansion in where you live.  In order to do this you will have to roam the huge mansion in search of items which you can use. Figuring out which items to use on a person and how to perform the execution without being caught can be tricky and you will have to use your brain to figure out the best way.  Overall a pretty fun game grab it when it's on sale, it only takes around 9 hours to complete and the achievements are easy.

294	1	a	Lucius was a cheesy horror B movie style game. It follows somewhat in line with the story of the movie Omen. Youâre a child whoâs been possessed by the devil and given powers to murder people. Itâs a pretty straight forward game with not much difficulty to it.  It was a decent game to play which had some funny and cool death scenes. It does have a slight challenge of trying to figure out what you need and how to kill your target. Itâs all based in and around the house you live in.  Controls were a little wonky but do their job. I even setup my own configuration with the steam controller which worked out pretty good. Only issues I had with it were movement on the bike you can get for Lucius to ride around on.   Graphics werenât bad just looked like something from years back. They get the job done and thatâs all that really matters when playing a game. The look on Luciusâs face was a little disturbing.  Overall it wasnât a bad game to play. Itâs pretty straightforward and not very hard to complete. You can get most of the achievements from pretty much just playing the game. Give it a try sometime as it should be easy to find a cheap copy floating around as itâs been bundled before and I think even given away for free.
3068	1	a	 Knytt Underground  is a puzzle-Metroidvania with lovely scenery and plenty of secrets to find. You play as a sprite who turns into a bouncy ball. Some of the bouncing puzzles are a bit frustrating, but you usually won't get sent too far back if you mess up. Your sprite form can climb walls and has better control than the ball, but can't jump as high.  Controls are rebindable. It uses an 'up to jump' control scheme, which might take some getting used to, but it actually works to the game's benefit, as you can jump to a wall and immediately start climbing.  The main menu is a playable area. To pick a chapter, move onto it and press the action button. Look closely and you can also find easter eggs and bonus levels. Even outside of the main game there is much to explore.  If an exploration focused puzzle-platformer sounds like your kind of game,  Knytt Underground  will make a fine addition to your library. Absolutely worth considering.

3033	1	a	I so very much love this game. I've spent most of my day today playing it because it's just that engaging. It's a beautiful combination of exploration-based gameplay and 2D platforming. The game map is huuuuuge. And that could be a bad thing, but exploring it is a joy because of the diverse atmospheres and all the little bits of story scattered throughout. I filled out the map simply because it was fun to explore. There's hundreds of puzzles and plenty of hidden objects to find, and the map's nice enough to mark mostly everything for you. The only thing you have to find on your own are the hidden passages (which on a few occasions are really difficult to find and figuring out how to reach hidden rooms is quite the epiphany~) That's not to say the game is easy, though. There's plenty of difficult action sequences, and if you plan to get all the achievements you really need to master the controls and the game's physics, because it can be HARD. Not quite as difficult as some precision platformers get, but you can spend a lot of time on the same screen or two. I really can't properly describe how this game pulls you in. Personally, I'd sit down, boot it up, and start filling in more of the map, only to discover that two or more hours had vanished while I was making progress. It's a game that demands your attention and doesn't easily let it go. And I'm quite glad I played it~

95	1	a	Pretty good game. I've only played it single player, as I was a forerunner for our group of players, but they all play LoL, and without the ability to buy a 4 pack after purchasing a single instance of the game, we probably wont be playing this as a group. Steam needs to change the ability of a current owner of a game to be able to purchase a 4 pack as gifts. So be warned, buy the 4 pack, and not the single player.  The maps are the best part of the game. The fact that things change, and it's not the same laning every. single. time.... Makes this game better than most of the other MOBAs out there. A change of scenery is nice every once in a while....

2125	0	a	DONT BUY ! Save your money...  This game has really serious texture and fps problems. (yes, after the patches...) Some textures are not loading, in addition some texture like ps2 version. Examples, furnitures, graffities... And of course the artificial intelligence is really bad.(worse than assassins creed) I just played the prologue and the first mission and I send request return...  Sorry , I really want to play this game but it is not like what I imagined.   Dear producer,  Just stop selling this.

1105	0	a	Would love to play this game, purchased it, but it does not work with my hardware. The scroll on the mouse doesn't work correctly, so you get to a point you can't do anything.. You can't modify that control setting, so you are pretty much screwed.. It looks like it would be a good story, but it's like a book missing half the pages.. get's to the point that it is a waste of time..
1343	1	a	Nothing like some Zombi guts all over you car.
3048	1	a	I like this game a lot, for a few reasons.  Gameplay consists of platforming, exploration, and item collection. The enjoyment of this game for me comes in with the characters, the atmosphere, and the setting. While there is no combat or complex puzzles and a lot of quests dead end and have no rewards, what you are left with is a game you play for the story. If the story isn't to your liking here then you probably wont like the game, but it worked out pretty well for me. I liked the interaction and development between the characters, and the game doesn't feel held back when it comes to discussing a few unpleasant topics or having characters act vulgar or make violent expressions when it fits (hence the game's Mature ESRB rating). The game's art-style for character portraits was initially a turn-off for me but I found myself not really minding it later into the game. The game also has good sound and art design for its environments, and can be very nicely ambient in atmosphere. The setting and lore of the game was very appealing to me too, and gives the player a few humorous moments thanks to meta-knowledge that the characters in the story dont posess.   Performance - No issues, runs fine, rebindable controls, graphics options are satisfactory. Controls are fairly tight and platforming is not very problematic. Some puzzles are hard, but not excessively so, and the game is very much non-punishing for failure-retry in its puzzles. There are optional parts with quite difficult puzzles, but those are presented completely aside from the main setting of the game.  Its a very good game, and quite long too for an indie game. I spent a lot of time enjoying myself and exploring things, and seeking out a few optional achievements, and put in about 20 hours into the game. I know this sort of enjoyment that is more story than gameplay driven is not for everyone, so a lot of people might find the game boring or lose interest, but I would definately reccommend it.

2679	1	a	I read about Deadly Premonition before and always wanted to play it, so when i saw it on steam, i immediately bought it, but unfortunately wasn't able to play very far with it's awful keyboard controls. So left it untouched until i got myself a good controller. DP's port is awful, honestly - no proper screen options and locked resolution, so it looked a bit weird on my monitor. A lot of bugs and glitches here and there, and it crashed on me every couple of hours or so, luckily nothing fatal enough to prevent me from beating it. But it did turn the rest of the game into 'from checkpont to checkpoint' and sometimes made me worry about losing my progress more, than about what's actually going on in there. But, aside from all technical troubles, Deadly Premonition is a pure gem. It's weird, it's strange, it's silly and charming, with not that good voice acting, hilarious face animation, great humor, old graphics, memorable characters, amazing soundtrack and interesting story, that will actually hit you in the face with a huge hammer in the last chapters - assuming you didn't give up earlier because of everything above. TL;DR an absolute must-have for everybody, who loves really good stories and can show some patience for clumsy gameplay and technical issues in order to see it all.

1777	1	a	  *free weekend review*   Played smooth, no technical issues I noticed. Enviroments are cool, sun/night cycles on its own and weather patterns are cool for the immersion.   Unfortunately, its a game that despite have never played before until now, feels like I already had. Seems like it follows the Red Faction : Guerrilla scheme of things except as a FPS. Seemingly shoved along storyline you could easily cut through in a short time, if you didnt pay as much mind to the side missions, radiant missions, and 'find it' progression-% items hidden in different locations.  Overall its recommendable if your into the story and theme of the game. It had a rough release with technical issues, but seems to run fine now. Again, its just a game that dose feel like its been done before after an hours worth of playing.

2447	1	a	This game isn't for the casual player. It's a hardcore RPG that you have to put time into in order to get into it, as I have found out. It's similar to Morrowind in the fact that it gives you next to no direction, so you have to find stuff out for yourself. I personally think it's awesome, it's got an in depth story that reeks adventure and the chatacters are all well developed too. At first you may think the graphics are utter crap, but they really do fit in with the feel of the game. As I said, the casual player beware, as this game isn't for the feint hearted.
