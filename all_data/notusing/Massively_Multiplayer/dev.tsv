7457	0	a	Wasn't that entertaining.
1479	1	a	Well, it was so nice to start this game at the beginning couple of years ago (I don't play on steam, i just prefer to play from GamersFirst launcher. I've got over 400 hours on APB.), It was, really. A lot of helpful players that can make you really happy. I had a pretty good clan when i started. I was having so much fun. They were really making a game that worths every single hour in the game. For a year I wasn't able to play the game. For a year i waited to play this game again and after some time I went back to game. A LOT of stuff changed for me. The new threat system, new fight clubs map, bounties, a lot of new weapons, new cars... At first I really liked it again. But after some time i realised that if you don't give tons of money to game to play properly, you can't have fun with this game..   Bad things after the change: -Good palyers have become â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s, (I've spent enough time to understand who is good and bad. There is no such thing as good (by good i'm trying to say helpful) player anymore...) -The currency of the game is not apb dollars, it's just the real money itself (So sad to think that i have donated over $50 to this game..) -The developers are just greedy people, (They make a weapon that you can only buy with real money in every patch...) -The potential of the game is just perfect but they really ruined it over the last year.. -Oh, I forgot the terrible matchmaking system. If you don't get rekt (i couldn't even say wrecked, it's THAT bad.) by couple of guys with the best weapons and with the highest ranks, you are one lucky guy..  Good thing i can still say: -One word: Customization. It's like you are playing The Sims with guns! It's awesome to create yourselves that you want to be deep down in your heart. -Graphics are not important most of the time, but i have to say this game was one of the best visual game of his time. They are still good but there is a collection of 'Next Gen Games' now. But still, i really like the visuals of the game.  There are still things that i can tell (Most of them are negative), but at the first sight you can see these ones. My overall rating to this game is 4.5-5/10, BUT if the developers ever listen to our complains to the game just once, this game can go up to 10 out of 10 by arranging APB to a free game(It's not just that, by polishing the bugs, removing the half of the population of the game(I'm talking about cheaters of course...etc.), even it's close to impossible. If they do that my feelings can get back the way it used to be. 
1632	1	a	Its a cool game play ir
3290	1	a	Overall a good experience when you are high level in the game and you are playing with 3 friends using VOIP, But now ever since the game switched to Steam, Its been riddled with hackers.  The game is about tactics, But new players don't see that part, They just run and shoot like CoD players.  The game is highly customisable, And has a wide variety of clothes and character attributes. You can be any character you'd like, Just re-create it, Takes some time, But its nice.  If you'd like to give it a try, I recommend it, Its free after all, But don't play alone.
8567	0	a	If this game wasnt P2W it would be so unbelievable GREAT. The coustomisation is unlike any other game. The idea is really something else aswell as captivating and competitive. If you only had to use real money to look cool or have a cool car it would be amasing. But this game is too unbalanced by the obtainable weapons with microtransactions that its hard to actually engoy it.
10670	0	a	Worst game ever played. (not gameplay wise)  I put settings to fullscreen i get a shop popup and now i cannot play the game anymore cause i cannot take it off and i cannot change back from fullscreen to windowed cause of it. tried uninstallig it several times didnt reset options. dont recommend to anyone.
1857	1	a	One of the best games ever made !! 
9252	0	a	Everytime I login, there is a 'Username' portion. There is no username, only the email address you put in to make an account. HOW AM I SUPOSSED TO LOG IN???
7765	0	a	If you join a game without being gold rank you will get kicked.
5603	0	a	  Open world tps game. This game features two factions, cops and criminals. One can enter world as any of the two. Characters are highly customisable. It has almost 6 maps, but matchmaking on in only 3 maps or districts (as called in game). Game play is average not so smooth. Matchmaking is worst. Beginners are mostly matched against gold and silver badges (bronze&lt;silver&lt;gold). The main problem is that old players who are gold and silver badge, have many accessories like body armour, fast cars, grenade launchers, etc etc which make it very difficult for new players to get kills against them. Eventually they feed on you, kill u a thousand times as new players get some basic guns and a trash car.   Final verdict : This is a pay to win game. If u can buy items with real money then u stand a chance. And is basically poorly developed GTA .   Sorry for long post. Heres ur kawaii potato
7015	0	a	I Play this for may Hours. Many Many hours through there opener not steam and well it got worse as i played i loved this game Sunk hours of my life in to it but in the end Quit from disappointment the game population has dissappered as well.  I could go well in to depth about why im dissapointed but it would be very very long
3937	0	a	its good but not optimized very well, for this reason i do not recommend this game
2913	1	a	You should definetly try this one , since its the best Free to play on steam.Its not a gta mmo but its close , diferent and good.

6933	0	a	Pay to win crap...ad that is all i have to say. Pay to Win or pay to do anthing really..cant customize anything unless you shell out cash
6021	0	a	Bad game you need actual money to buy guns worthless game
315	1	a	Really great but HARD game, you have to play a hundred hours to be really good and enjoy the game.
2842	1	a	Love it 
957	1	a	APB is a game that has a big learning curve because it doesn't tell you what you are supposed to be doing at any given point. That said it is a game that I keep coming back to because I enjoy the movement and shooting mechanics, as well as the open world and seamless missions, and driving cars. This is not GTA: There are not a million cars. This game is about teamwork, shooting, running and parkour. It got these elements down, moreso than GTA. I think you can play this game without paying and have fun, however there are SOME advantages to buying equipment, I guess it's mostly aesthetic.  I wish other games would pull off what this game has done well, but they haven't yet. The movement, and physics are pretty good, much better than GTA5 garbage combat mechanics. Customization is unmatched ANYWHERE.  I love this game in spite of it's flaws. And I want a CAP40 sooooo bad!!
10480	1	a	It is a good game.
1578	1	a	it is gta but free very fun with friends
8168	0	a	Worst â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game i ever played.
7095	0	a	This game â¥â¥â¥â¥ing suck â¥â¥â¥ it WILL NOT STOP â¥â¥â¥â¥ING RUNNING AND ITS MAKING ME LAG  
869	1	a	game isnt p2w (almost all of the guns that cost $$ are reskins of guns you can get in game for free) and the ones that arent reskins are trash excluding a couple, and if you arent a complete idiot you can easily get by with the starter gun or just use in game money to rent guns which are all pretty much good  other than that having 'premium' only offers more customization and easier progression in the game (it is a shooter rpg not a tps) and the progression doesnt even get you anything useful except modifications and vehicles which you can just buy from other users using in game money anyway  in my experience hackers exist but it isnt a prevalent issue kinda like cheaters in csgo its not terribly common but it definetely exists except you see less crying in csgo, which is a game you actually paid money for so Â¯\_(ã)_/Â¯  game isnt 100% amazing though, the company is pretty slow with content releases beyond new weapons, the matchmaking could use an overhaul and community can be toxic af  overall the game is nowhere near as bad as most people think it is i would reccommend giving it a try but hey you know this is just coming from someone with ~4 years of playing on and off so the reviews where dumbasses have a couple hours played and only cry about p2w or hacking are probably more valuable tbh  also my steam hours for apb arent accurate since i played a lot off steam
10802	1	a	The evil empire of Kabam is dead, now with Deca I can see a brighter future.
2142	1	a	This is a great game if you want to have some competitive gameplay... it is Recommended that sometimes you play with friends because you may run across the usual Elite Gamer (Hackers Many people call them &gt;.&gt;) but the game offers a very in depth character customization and creation from what you wear to the car you drive! there are alot of diffrent guns that you can use and try and maybe even down the line if you find something you love you can put alittle money forward and get that gun, go out... shoot everyone up and RULE THE WORLD!!!!!  10/10 Will go on a rampage again
5146	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ matchmaking. Also, most likely, it will be a bunch of f2p's against a team full of premiums(premiums often have better weapons and experience). At night, the server is full of hackers using aimbot. The only thing good about this game is the customization. It seems like that's the only thing the devs put effort into this game. I recommend to not spend your money into such a bad game, if you are planning to play G4YPB.
2166	1	a	Okay I guess. heres a list of pros and cons  Pros: -Amazing character customization -High population districts -Fight clubs to practice  Cons: -Silvers must play with golds -Horrid Driving -Bad Optimization -Bad Match making -Bad Graphics -Never any new content -Greedy Dev Team -Not really any new content announced for the future -Hit the head or the legs same damage

4457	0	a	I encourage playing this game as a free alternative to drinking bleach.
10824	1	a	Looks Like A Good Game, Probably Will Get It Soon :D
8596	0	a	One of the best games ever. Don't get swayed by the pictures though. Almost if not everything on them has to be paid with real money in order to be used, and nothing is actually that cheap. The game has serious flaws that need to be fixed ASAP, but are there for a long time now. The game has potential, but the company behind it is too slow to make it a game worth paying on the long run.
5838	0	a	I have played a long while without steam since close Beta, all G1 gamers are friendly and F2P.   Till 2013, P2W became hot topic in this game and i totally AGREE those people who invest a lot of MONEY in this game can have HIGH CHANCE TO WIN,  That trigged gamers (most of them are UNMATURE KIDS) tried to use with HACK PROGRAMMES for tricking G1 points and gaming that happened on 3 servers(EU, NA, HK). [Check youtube please, Gamerfirst]  The threat system became a joke for me. FAKE GOLD, HACKER CLAN.  I believe people will change, and game as well,  but it have become worst than what gamers should EXPERIENCE( ENJOYMENT, EXCITMENT and TEAMWORK).  Im sick of the communty with hackers and team killers.  Please someone help this game.
4341	0	a	A bad copy of an old game, rather than a good copy of a new one. How many times DO I need to shoot someone in the head with a rifle before they die? Guess I didn't insert enough money. New account creation from inside the game is awful. Keep trying
5120	0	a	For some reason my game will not work, im getting very fustrated with APB reloded. When i try to load it, it just shows a picture of APB reloded and thats all, plz i need help.
6084	0	a	A better barren wasteland than Fallout 3.
8287	0	a	This game is a pay to win ClusterFork.  It's not enjoyable, and in no means can I recommend it to you and feel good about doing so.  In my opinion, I'd say avoid this game, it's not worth the time.
6300	0	a	TL,DR: Good concept, poor execution  APB Reloaded, what can I say.  At first, it sounded great, an open world comps vs robbers stile game, something different. Lots of customisable options including kill sounds, brilliant.  Then the play started.  It is not friendly towards new players. The tutorial system works for the first three full 'missions' then its kill the most advanced players in the game. The customisation is clunky, time consuming and the customised music requires advanced midi making knowledge.  Players on both teams seem to either hack, or have no lives (or money) as weapons are mostly pay to aquire (and then only for a limited time), or they have aimbots and kill in up to three shots (normally takes around ten).  As an added extra, after the recent update, the game likes to randomally lag and kick people out of the game, disconnecting for unknown reasons.
9421	0	a	Hey lets put a help chat where the MOD's totally block everything you say bad about the game....played it for 45 min and they didn't allow anyone to say anything bad about the game.....let's just put it out there. It's not arcade like, mods black your chat espcially if you say something that insn't working. Stay away from the game if you can they don't want to hear the truth...The truth is this: they made a game that doesn't allow you to tell them whats wrong with it, the controls are not working, middle mouse button to switch from clicking to moving doesn't work....stay away from this game....
5869	0	a	If you're not sure if you want to kill yourself play this Then you will kill yourself
3504	1	a	Great game!
8799	0	a	its â¥â¥â¥
8564	0	a	Sadly I got banned from this game but I would recommend for customizations but not recommend due to the in balance in game play when people buy from the micro transaction
2755	1	a	Summary: In APB Reloaded you take on the role of a Criminal - hell-bent on causing havoc and making money, or an Enforcer - tapped by the city to keep order. The city never sleeps and the fight never ends in this fast paced Massively Multi-player, Action Shooter! 
63	1	a	I got a 3 guns for spending $300 on the game.
6044	0	a	would be good if it could start 10/10 
9312	1	a	amazing game.... always something to do... if you like fallout you WILL like this game.. its like fallout 3 but turned into an MMO and a better crafting system
6741	0	a	wot a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ shit game pay for this pay for that full of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ noobs who been playing for years so new people cart do â¥â¥â¥â¥
10636	1	a	IS FUN SO U SHOULD BUY IT 
4364	0	a	This game is a clunky, pay to win, grand theft auto wannabe with floaty driving controls, and awful gunplay. Just because I don't invest money into your game doesn't mean I shouldnt have a CHANCE. The gun you start off with is so weak, I unloaded 3 full clips into a guy (Who might I add, was decked out in fancy micro-transaction clothing.) and he had hardly a drop of blood leave his body. Then he proceeded to pull out his micro-transaction LMG, soot me three times, and kill me. This game is terrible, you might think I'm being unfair, but I've put almost three hours into this game (which I know isn't the highest amount, but this game is so bad...) through three seperate occassions thinking I might have been a bit too harsh, but no, this is just plain bad.
10029	0	a	Looking at this, I was expecting a Fallout-ish experience. I was mistaken, but not by much. Don't let the play time fool you, I played a good 50 hours of this outside of Steam. Pros: -Crafting -Exploration -Factions -Multiple starts -Many weapons -Steampunk feel -Reminiscent of New Vegas without being a clone -Very open  Cons: -Glitchy -Crafting system is a bit confusing -PvP is populated almost entirely by hackers -Optimizatin is â¥â¥â¥â¥ -Players are generally ill-tempered -AI isn't verry Intelligent -Quests can be a handful at times -Aiming likes to twitch, making long-range shots hard -Leveling system is a pain  Neutral: -Tutorial can be a bit confusing on your first run through -Graphics are a bit dated -Kinda empty (Not sure if they're going for the 'Wasteland' feel)  Overall, it's fun to play with friends for a week or two, but not something I'd sink another 50 hours into
3034	1	a	Awesome game. Very open worlded and customizable. Definitley get it.
6052	0	a	This game isnt bad but there are alot of hackers and not very fun when the game is free to play but its pay to win
3809	0	a	Greetings everyone who decides to read this Review of APB.  I'm an EX-player of APB:R after an insane amount of time and felt it was a duty to help give some advice on this game.  **NOTE: I'VE HAD AN APB ACCOUNT PREVIOUS TO THE CREATION OF MY STEAM ACCOUNT.**  The world of APB:R is immense in the sense of how whacky and fun it can be. You'll encounter strange occurances with objects (cars in this instance) interacting stupidly with other objects and it's all a joy. I've sincerely have had a lot of fun with this game. Oh! One more thing, the entire concept of APB:R being 'Pay to Win' is a complex haox from everything I've encountered in my 4 year run with APB.   How is it not Pay to Win?   Simple. All 'ARMAS' weapons you'll see in the game are typically re-skins or variations of the same weapon you can achieve with normal gameplay and progression.  Example: Joker CR Rifle is the exact same as the N-TEC and VARS-SWORD.  Many of these guns just are bought for their advantages due to their pre-set modifications which even then an ordinary player can obtain after playing for a bit of time.  The Customization is ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC, I've never had such a creative outlet in my life previous to APB:R. Making a fresh and beautiful designed IO: GROWL, or FireHawk Vegas or whatever car of your pleasing is one of the best things you can do in APB:R. Show it off to your fellow faction-mates and even those on the opposing side! Make your own death-theme for your victims to listen so that they know it was YOU who ended their misery. Customize your clothing, get creative with tattoos! Enjoy an environment that's not restricted to just PRE-SET PRE-DESIGNED decals like most games would have.  Wait! This review is NOT recommending this game why?  Over the last couple of weeks, something has been happening. Something that has been triggering/messing with player-base. The ANTI-CHEAT SYSTEM: FAIRFIGHT, in addition to the formerly used PUNKBUSTER, has been flagging players, both cheaters and non-cheaters, and respectfully banning the player in question.  Isn't that a good thing?  Well, I'd suppose it would be a good thing that the anti-cheat system is actually banning people and actively detecting the use of horrid third-party programs and the lot, but, what about those who were non-cheaters?  I'm one of those players.  I'm formerly known as the criminal: xShadowscythe.  A few days ago, I logged into the game I've loved for so long, entered a match, and as I was driving to my next destination BANNED.  Oh? Banned? You could just open a ticket to GamersFirst, maybe they'll help you out?   NOT AT ALL.  Although the game is fantastic and such, the company that hosts the game is unwilling to clarify/justify/assist any of it's players with any information regarding to why they were banned.  Upon sending an email to the support staff, I've been handed an automated letter and have not been given any insight onto why I was banned from the game other than 'Someone has been conducting suspicious activity that violates our Terms of Service.' Upon a request for clarification or for a reason I was promptly sent away and denied with yet another automated message.  For those who have read this review and thinking of still playing APB:R  I sincerely hope you give the game a shot and help in it's resurrection, but please be aware of the corruption and malfunctioning system in place as of OCTOBER 31ST, 2016. I sincerely hope you all have a good time in the game and will leave this review with one final piece of advice.  Please DO NOT spend any money on the game for a good amount of time. Please take time to talk to other players, preferably veterans, about the status of the game, the recent banning issues and how GamersFirst communicates with it's players.  Love,   xShadowscythe.
9119	1	a	Fallen Earth is an MMORPG game with the Post-Apocaliptic theme. You can either play in first person , either in third person ... But in first person you can only fight. Its OK for my taste. Its free . Its good for MMORPG lovers . I recommend it.
3301	1	a	Great game i would recommend to anyone
2843	1	a	Fun way to kill some time, just don't take it seriously. The community on this game is awful.
4866	0	a	P2W at its finest. When I played it first few years ago it wasn't so bad, you could kill the opponent. But now? You don't have chance as free player. Better launch GTA muliplayer.
6348	0	a	look only at the negative comments on this game dont listen to the positive one's.
2553	1	a	This game has an awesome grindy mmo feel with a GTA-like theme. The only problem is that it's very pay to win but you can EASILY avoid it by going into servers for lower ranks so you dont run into high level pay to plays.
1470	1	a	great game to play, tho you can very easily can get banned or kicked from joining online servers, for doing the petiest things wrong...
6610	0	a	I Play this for may Hours. Many Many hours through there opener not steam and well it got worse as i played i loved this game Sunk hours of my life in to it but in the end Quit from disappointment the game population has dissappered as well.  I could go well in to depth about why im dissapointed but it would be very very long
2587	1	a	Mediocre, through and through. An good try but F2P limits its potential.
10031	1	a	Its a really awesome underated game..wish more people enjoyed it :l
10478	1	a	Yeah its pretty cool, don't play it much now.
5722	0	a	This entire fricking game is PAY TO WIN, you can not do well what so ever UNLESS you drop 20$+ on a gun, it is not worth the time, the whole game consists of flaming and insults and the whole matchmaking system is so screwed up that you will constantly be put up against people who are veterans despite what ever your experience is in the game.  If you wish to constantly get angry nd possibly break things in your house, go ahead and get this game, other than that, it is not worth it.
6051	0	a	What a clunky, frustrating, and really boring game. Since the game began, there have only been 2 core city maps. Decent sizes but full of really boring and useless things to do. So you do missions endlessly. Now to the game's credit, when you get two teams who are equally balanced and moderately competent, it can be fun. Those moments reminded me of Saints Row 2 multiplayer (RIP). But the method to aquire clothing and guns is such a disgusting grind of blah. The car physics and driving camera are both awful to deal with. The guns are not balanced in the least. The power levels of players and matchmaking is not balanced in the least. Newbs can expect to be the whipping boy for anyone with a decent modded weapon, abilities, and upgrades. THose players get the same for killing a weak newbs as they do an equally matched player... so who do you think they go after all the time? No wonder the game died. There is zero evidence of any kind of non-cosmetic content since launch. The game allows rampant abuses, and creates them with a lack of proper matchmaking, leveled areas, or any mechanism to balance the game in any way.  Go play GTA5 multi... it's vastly superior. APB was an ok idea that set the bar really low for itself and didnt do anything to raise it. The game is still kind of active but new players were constantly being discouraged and leaving due to the buzzards who quite obviously flaunted their unfair advantages at every turn.  Oh wait... APB doesnt care. If you want to actually not get wrecked and not spend 6 months grinding incredibly stupid unlocks you give them money. It's free toplay. No surprises. But it's been out for 8 years. And the level of content available is so insanly limited... oh wait no there are a ton of clothing and ca options if you want to grind it out or pay up... but the gameplayu is still lame, shallow, and lacking any kind of meaningful substance. It blows.  So if you think it looks kind of fun, it can be for a little while until you see all the things that are wrong with it. Then you will wake up and say 'Why am I wasting my time with this when it's 2016 and there are vastly superior but similar experiences to have?'
8699	0	a	Updates are ruining it, bad tutorial, multipayer is almost dead.
346	1	a	Great Game!
9365	0	a	this game looks good but when i downloaded it,it failed to start.even after deleting appcache and restarting the computer or deleting and redownloading it it still does not download........totally a waste of time.pls steam if you can fix it pls pls pls do so
1030	1	a	Buggy as hell but an amazing game
974	1	a	It's like eating â¥â¥â¥â¥ and drinking diarrhea at the same â¥â¥â¥â¥ing time. Basically it's just bad
1641	1	a	This game is so wonderful. Ive spent over 300 hours playing and i plan to continue to play for many many many more hours. The cheaters in the game? its nowhere near as bad as people make it out to be. I only encounter 1 cheater every 60-100 mathces. Even then, they aren't ridiculously blanant and only have some sort of aim assistance, but you can still beat them if you are any good at the game. The game doesn't run the best, but they are working on a new engine and really want to have it up soon. If we got more people to come into all of these servers and get a little more revenue going towards the developers, we might actually see big improvements in this game. It has the potential to be an awe inspiring game that we play for years to come. I seriously recommend trying this game, the learning curve can be a little steep at first, but its nothing you cant get over. The community isn't always bad either, quite a few people are willing to help if you simply ask. Over all, one of my favorite all time games, i seriously recommend it
4694	0	a	11/10 would not recommend, game still is broken
4993	0	a	Back when I had my crappy good ol' Pentium 4, the controls lagged like hell. When I upgraded to a half-decent computer in 2012, the controls lagged like hell. And now that I upgraded to a pretty decent gaming computer, the controls still lag like hell.  In all seriousness, the game itself is fine. The gunplay is what you'd describe as 'good enough', nothing fancy or innovating, but it works. The main problem I had is that the character customization actually lying to you and, as previously mentioned, the car controls. On the topic of characters, once you finish painstakingly customizing your looks (Which you can't change without paying an absurd amount of money I may add), your avatar looks barely like the one you created, which wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that I tried to replicate Frank West and ended up with Sloth from The Goonies.  And as far as the vehicle controls go, they're bloody awful. The cars themselves handle fine, or at the very least the Not!Audi TT you get at the beginning of the game, but there's an almost one second delay between you pressing a key and the car actually doing something, which obviously results in you driving like you drank half the stash of illegal alcohol you were ferrying around town. Sadly the community isn't very helpful when trying to fix this issue, as most of the replies you get are 'You suck', 'The game is pretty big, deal with it', or 'The game is fine, upgrade your rig' which the latter is kinda hard to do when you're running almost top-of-the-line hardware. I'm not TotalBiscuit, goddammit, I don't have enough money to buy four Titan Xs.  In short, if you can run Crysis 1 at 240 FPS on 4K resolution, I'd give it a shot, otherwise either don't; or get ready to do some cardio, as you'll be running all over the city.

1782	1	a	Pretty good game except for the fact that it kills my pc just trying to run it.
4730	0	a	Apparently it's pay to win, although I couldn't really tell. Everyone had lots of gear, somebody shot me and I had no idea what was going on.

6944	0	a	Sucks, lag is bad. used to 'like' the game but now anymore
460	1	a	I wasn't sure what to think of this game when I first picked it up. Interesting idea, but there was/is a bit of lag at times, and a ton of cheatin' hackers. However looking past that, as soon as they patch to the new Unreal engine which will solve those issues, the games definitely a good one if you want to play a MMOFPS game. Even though the population is a bit small, the size of the maps is big enough not to feel crowded, yet small enough you don't have to travel far to find something being blown up or someone to shoot. All in all 8/10 imho.
4981	0	a	Welcome to APB. GTA 5 for the Poor People. 1/10 +hacker and wallers
10117	1	a	Amazing Roleplaying game with a TON of action, combat, and crafting involved. It's like minecraft meets skyrim then gets in a nuclear war.
1837	1	a	Love the limitless customization. But the community is not really good due idling the newbie. No pay to win, In-game weapon still can killng the enemy. But the only problem is when the higher rank player get a better gear and shooting you all time.

6778	0	a	Used to be a fun game, now it's just a laggy clunky pay2win piece of crap MoneyFirst uses to milk the players wallet.
5830	0	a	This game is horrible because there servers lag and there game lags for no reason with the best ping.There moderators are trolls i played the game for 3 hours then a moderator bans me permanantly for no apparent reason i didnt get and email of why i got banned i didnt do anything wrong.

9596	0	a	derivative and repetitive. You'll find nothing in this game that every other mmo doesn't have. It's crafting is pointlessly slow and the map is too big and the content too low. Leveling to 20 and entering a new map is tedious and punishing. Don't download it just because it's free. Guild Wars 2 is free now and infinitely better.

7323	0	a	this didnt work. it just took up room and now i cant delete it 
3859	0	a	This game is awful.   1. FPS mechanics are terrible, with NO HEAD HITBOXES. AWFUL HIT DETECTION. EXTREMELY LONG TTK (which would be fine if there were skill-based mechanics involved).   2. Extreme pay to win a la Asian shooter, i.e. you have to either spend all of your time playing this game, spend money, or fail to be competitive due to expiring weapons.   3. Maps and respawns were balanced by chimps. Some missions favor one side immensely over the other. Not to mention the vapid objective based gameplay.   4. Matchmaking is terrible with veterans having extreme advantages over new players with perks. Sure CoD can do this, but it doesn't make it any less stupid.   5. Cheaters abound.   6. Little variety at the core of the game which is quintessentially a few big team-based CTF flags with car chases in between. Sounds fun on paper and is fun the first 30 times, then it gets old along with the rock-paper-scissors gunplay.   The only good thing I can say about this game is that the graphics are fair and it runs.. alright. The character, car and clothes customization is amazing, along with the custom themes (music editor), but it's at the core a grindy, imbalanced collection of little CTF maps where the world around you feels fake and shallow, just like the gunplay.   Don't waste your time downloading this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥. It had potential 10 years ago. Now it's just a waste.   
2327	1	a	Its awfully balanced and the guns that you pay for are clearly better than the ones you get by just playing. Yet i keep coming back to it
845	1	a	Great game, so much fun fighting it out against the enforcers as a criminal. The customization in this game is amazing!

214	1	a	I was playing this game before it was on steam -.- Hipster.........â¥â¥â¥â¥in' sexy game when you don't get â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off with the ammount of absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t hackers.... :D
182	1	a	APB:R is a mechanically solid game with amazing customization options -including an option to upload your own music and play it with an in-game radio, but it's seriously marred by punishing hardware demands and one of the worst communities not actually directly affiliated with an organized Hate Group.  APB:R's got a mean learning curve, too, and not just in terms of gun fighting. High skill players also know the city and it's many alleys, highways, ramps, and neighborhoods quite well, and being travel time efficient is one of the greatest advantages for completing missions. You'll need to know the weapons as well and that's also not a trivial task.  The setting's quite detailed as well and fairly intriguing. There's a lot going on in this tale of a city committing suicide to save it's life and it's told from many different perspectives by a few dozen well composed NPC's. Shame it's also not an ongoing story.  A word on microtransactions: there are quite a few of them, and more coming all the time. Much of it is exclusive, but usually cosmetically. If you don't care what your OCA or NTEC looks like, you can unlock -permanently- weapons that'll perform just about as well as anything that costs real money. In terms of what's 'necessary' Premium time nearly doubles your income and contact progression rate, and that'll really start to tell once you get deep into the game and start seeing max level 15 contacts.  And much as APB:R's servers look like a dumping ground for unwanted (and tragically unaborted) children get this straight: it's a business, not a public park. Servers cost money, money means selling stuff. Get over it, or uninstall.  APB:R has a real and an active hacker problem. The worst offenders are the Americans, so keep off the game during American holidays and afternoon hours. Fair Fight helps, but it's bad to the point of hacker cadres bragging about how they stay in APB:R just to â¥â¥â¥â¥ with the devs, and who can point you at all their favorite forums and programs.   In Global Chat -just ask.  (Here's a good unofficial metric: read through the comments for this game that accompany any dev announcement or piece of news. Assume half the people denying hacking are doing it themselves. Say that's about %10, 1 in 5x2.  Now go play, and remember that number when you realize that these folks are the most active players when you see a newly minted rank 80 burn through your entire team with an unmodded Joker rifle. Sure his K/A/D is 17-3-0, but he's 'just that good.' Especially with one of the worst weapons in the game*. So _pro_. That he's also driving a completely stock version of the basic free car also means nothing -he just decided to reroll.  So what's suspicious about an unbelievably expert player with a Gold skill ranking in a game built on long-term progression and customization who likes to use a completely basic gun and restart at random? And who apparently can track you through walls? Can make jumping max-range hits on targets behind 90% cover with a sniper rifle?  I sound salty; I am.  I've seen this scenario play itself out _dozens_ of times.  If APB:R finally succumbs I'll miss it because truly there isn't much like it anywhere.  But I won't wonder why.  I'm recommending APB:R because there is a lot to love, but it's drowning in a sewage sump of the worst people you can find online. And no mistake, 'drowning' is no exaggeration. The devs keep patching and updating slowly and regularly, but the handicap of it's unbelievably vile community must cripple the growth it needs to stay online. F2P is a great model that only works if new people show up to buy, and given few actual new players stick around and that there's an upcoming global server merge doesn't say to me that it'll survive if it doesn't find some effective solution to it's many gloating and vocal cancers.   There's a play engine upgrade coming (eventually) and that'll probably be the make-or-break point when the stresses of the (realistically) many implementation bugs makes players who didn't log in to â¥â¥â¥â¥ with someone else wonder if they've got the patience to deal with everything they don't like about APB:R showing up while everything they play it for is in a limbo of bugs and disconnections.  Bottom line: bring your A game and your thickest skin, and stay off the servers during weekends unless you bought better aimbots than the other guys.  *The Joker SR-15 is inferior to just about every other rifle in every way except these: RoF and magazine size. Critically rifles, not SMG's or AR's, don't have iron sights.  They're meant to be light marksman's weapons with above average per-round damage that do poorly at close range. Our friend being described above will be running and leaping as he hip-fires his weapon. That has no crosshairs and a deviation box the size of a baseball diamond. At max RoF. ... GG.
5863	0	a	its not very good in general the animations arew choppy the leveling system is bugged and it feels like a gta 3 clone
1817	1	a	Good Game Horrible Community
3021	1	a	IT HAS GUNS AND â¥â¥â¥â¥
5250	0	a	I'm going to tell honestly my opinion about this game . First at all i start with the bad side of this game which would be the really awful community . People take the game way to serious , a lot of bad words are getting used in the District chat, really mean people who just search for conflicts and fights. For me the community in online games matters a lot so here i can give APB between 1-10 a fair 3 and only because i met a few nice people otherwise it would be unfair.  Well from the community i can mention the 'cheaters' in this game. If you have really bad nerves then i wouldn't suggest you to play APB simply because there are really a lot of cheaters and yes im not in a position to claim half of the high rank people are using cheats but from a website called fairfight you can make your own image about the amount of hackers in this game .  So now we have a bad Community and lots of cheaters (everyday just imagine it lulz ) and we need help from the owners of this game ...Gamersfirst . So you want another reason why i don't suggest you the game? Here we go ;D  This game belongs to a company that a lot of ' normal ' people in APB hate simply because Gamersfirst doesn't give a â¥â¥â¥â¥ about the players. If you have problems or a request you send them a email and get as usual a auto-message . It often takes way to long to get a response and you kinda have to spam(?) them till they answer even tho if they do, its just lame answers such as ' we work on it' ,or 'please be patient ' . Mentionable is their promises which they don't keep such as an engine update which was planned to be done long time ago but instead they do now interviews with their staff members , kewl huh?.  The only thing which i would say is nice in the game is the cuztomisation.. thats all to be honest . You have lots of ways to make clothings , cars and again thats it :D   At all i don't play it much but when i do its only because of my Character , i guess thats just my girlish side .  Try it out and see if you like it or not but be aware of the meanies out there !   Thanks for reading and Bye Bye &lt;3 
8730	0	a	It's a great game, the pewpew action is very satisfying. The sound is absolutely incredible! And i'm always a sucker for games with the level of customization that APB has. However: The hacking is absolutely ridiculous. It takes two shots to kill someone with a sniper rifle, but people will kill you with two bullets from a side arm. Then there's the ability to shoot through walls (not as bad as CS used to be). Many times i will hit the wall I'm hiding behind, with half my body exposed. But other people will have barely a head showing, and waste you.   I try to play bad, so I can go back down in threat, where the hackers are not prominent. But it's tedious. If you can tolerate the hacks, it's a great game. I will unlikely spend money on this until they fix that. I'd uninstal entirely, but my character looks badass.
330	1	a	the game is messing upits not letting me in i press play game it dont play whats going on
5480	0	a	wont load, wont unistall, â¥â¥â¥â¥....
4242	0	a	Lets just say this is not the APB reloaded I remember...
1497	1	a	lots of boobies ( . Y . )
3287	1	a	Its very fun and its worth the while
10033	1	a	Saw this downloadable on Steam, was thinking about giving it a second chance...Played for several years, took a break. This game, like many others, comes close, but falls short of the Ultimate MMORPG(FPS).  Pros:  Detailed crafting system. Excellent Foraging/Salvaging System. Gain levels from crafting. Crafting actually takes longer (for a realistic effect), ie. you can't craft a car in 2 minutes, it takes awhile... Gameplay is fun, it's nice to have a MMOFPS that actually counts headshots. Graphics are decent. You actually have to aim (for most skills/attacks). Pretty Realistic in some aspects.   Cons: The character animations are super clunky and akward. Small playerbase. The mutations (think of it as magic in other games) are pretty limited, ie. no 'caster' class in the game.   That's about all I can think of for now. Overall, it's a good game, if you haven't tried it, its atleast worth a try!
5555	0	a	thanks cyberdelia for wasting my â¥â¥â¥â¥ing time
5892	0	a	I would call this game Pay to Win. Argue if you want, but it's a multiplayer PVP game for the most part and you can buy cooldowns, permanent weapons ( some with exclusive mods, ) 2.25 times more cash gains etc...  You can buy pretty much everything permanently with real money right off the bat, be it cars, weapons, etc. If you want to be 100% Free to Play, be ready to spend tons of gold on 10-days lasting weapons. You will have to gather money for days to get one permanent weapon, only if someone is selling one on the Marketplace. The community is terrible, there's many bugs, random downtimes which cancel your missions and you lose the rewards you would have gotten for that misson. Also you can slaughter the whole city and be unnoticed, but be wary that breaking a store window by mistake, not even stealing anything and the other players playing enforcers can arrest you and steal all the money you have on you!  Also the matchmaking is terrible, sometimes you get matched with 2 other silvers and you have to face 3 golds. Your whole team could be rank 20 and you play against rank 200+ which have more mods, better cars, knows the game more and have better weapons. You have ''Bronze, Silver and Gold'' servers, but they're full of golds who like to pwn noobs either way. Only the leader can call for backup and people go AFK randomly pretty often.  Also, if your team leader ( which seems to be random because 90% of the time I join a mission I am not the leader, ) decides that he dosen't like you, he can kick you right before the mission ends to make you lose all the money and experience you would've gotten. He can also kick you just because you killed him by mistake, just because you sprayed a tag before him or even because you are MVP and he wants to be MVP instead!  The good? It's probably one of the only MMO that looks like GTA and Saints Row. The graphics are ok and the game has alot of content. Sadly, it's not a game I would play more than I already did after noticing all the flaws it has.  Here's the benefit of premium ( forums says it's 12.50$ per month: )  Around 90% bonus to all Contact XP gains. +125% bonus cash gain ( Instead of 500$ for a mission you would gain 1125$. ) 20% discount on the Armas Marketplace ( Real money marketplace. ) 50% shorter cooldown on abilities like Field supplier, Nitro booster, etc. ) Deeper Customization (50 Symbols per Vehicle / Clothing items, 100 layers per Symbol. ) Removal of Subscription ADS ( which appears at the end of all missions. ) Armas Trials for weapons and vehicles last 3 hours instead of 30 minutes ( which makes using the 200~ trials, 6 times more effectively. )
1596	1	a	Here, you can rent weapons. 10/10, I would rent again.
10242	1	a	Amazing game, it's free, third person, not much else to say, download, play, have fun!
2448	1	a	Honestly gta 1 was better than this.
9983	1	a	fun for anyone wanting to have fun killing things
4728	0	a	If you are reading this review, then you probably haven't played the game yet.  Don't. Just don't.   You'll be put in against everybody with grenade launchers and LMGs while you're stuck with the worst guns possible. The Silver and Gold tiers of players are loaded with hackers, most of which gave up playing legit and got their hacks just to be able to compete with the other hackers, because that makes so much sense.  Thankfully this review is hosted on Steam servers instead of the APB servers, otherwise you'd be stuck re-reading every other sentence 3 times trying to make it to the end.

6978	0	a	Now, this game is really fun and has lots of stuff packed into the game and I can clearly see lots of work has been put into this game. However,   Pros: -Very costumizable cars -Lots of clothes and accessories -Really fun missions -Very fun gameplay  Cons: -Horrible lag -Missions are very repetitive and have little variety   Other than that, this game is really fun.  8/10 would lag again.
4393	0	a	Buggy, laggy (due to other players) and EXTREAMLY unfair. Any one in the area can pick a fight with you, and most likely they are 50 levels or more above you, have far better weapons, or even worse have payed wepons. That and aim bots that they have still yet to stop, makes a game not worth any one's time. Shouldn't have released this without fixing all of that first. I don't trust it, and never will trust it. All the creators care about is how good it looks. LOOKS AREN'T EVERYTHING!
9938	1	a	Just another boring old MMO right? WRONG!! This game is absolutely uh not that addictive tho but it is decent.The most decent game I had ever played.The game started in a wasteland where you are a clone.If you had played Fallout before then the game is a bit similar to this except this is an MMO.The game is really fun to play with especially the blood sport.The blood sport is a PVP arena where you play Team DeathMatch,Capture the Flag and so on.The best part is this game is not I repeat NOT PAY 2 WIN!! You can basically get anything you want in this game using the in-game currency which is 'chips'.The community is really helpful and not annoying at all.If you need any help in the game you should just ask in the chat and one of the members will help you out.They are all friendly in the game.This game deserve 7/10
6130	0	a	nothig to do but run around and kill pepole
4159	0	a	This game will steal your soul, i do NOT recommend.
2569	1	a	Always better with a team.
4933	0	a	When i played this game... i just felt it was unfair in a ton of ways. Also, huge random Lag spikes, when i'm at 60fps.. Just suddendly drops to 2fps then back to 60fps. I don't know why it does that, but it's mainly caused by Explosions...
6869	0	a	APB Reloaded is a great game, one that you will find yourself returning to play over and over again. Then..... You will find yourself rage quit'ing in disgust. Hackers run rampant throughout the game in groups, the games (Fair-fight) system never seems to get the blatantly obvious players. I have over 1000 hours on the game between both my enforcer and criminal chars. While playing tonight three seperate groups were running around trolling the financial district. Hmmmm, killing people at 80m with a short range weapon, no recoil on that machine gun, pistols that never miss, etc. etc... These are pretty obvious, and after years of playing this game, I have to say that its obvious the Developers who have taken over dont care. Not worth your time people, my suggestion do not get sucked into this game.
3726	1	a	It's Free, it's Fun, why wouldn't you play it?
3252	1	a	... Pay to the win.  
2435	1	a	The best crime warfare !!! Weapons and outfits are no limits. Open-world and cool online missions can replace GTA V! { Just only my opinion. Sorry if you're GTA fan }
7879	0	a	Game is fun...for a while then it just goes down to who pays more and has the better weapons. You cna kinda try to defend yourself but in the end. P2P &gt; F2P
3478	1	a	;)
6045	0	a	The game was fun while it lasted, arresting people, clan war all that stuff was fun, however, two things ruined it; One, the game became very pay to win. I mean, you could play and still kill SOME people, but if someone has a gun that cost 3.99 and you've got your little peashooter, you're dead meat.  Two, and this is the main thing, and if it gets fixed, I'll come back to playing it, and I may be tempted to pay some money, but this really isn't easy to fix. Here goes: The game has a few servers, one for newbies, one for casuals, and one for veterans. The problem is that casuals and veterans will repeatedly get themselves killed to lower their rank, and then they gang up on the newbies. Yes, people are that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. They think their big and bad when they do that, and they call everybody 'Noob!' and think they're good.  Overall, I think the game is really awesome, but until they find a way to keep veterans away from the casuals and newbies, the game is unplayable. You can't even get better, because you're litteraly dead within seconds.

3762	0	a	APB is a classic case of great concept done very poorly. After watching it 'evolve' over time I have come to this conclusion about APB and its design. I will try to stay the concise points for easy reading. - Designed to promote negativity between players (yes the game is PVP however they make no genuine effort to promote teamwork and community building between players) - Missions are 50% easily one sided, 25% one sided based upon player tallents, and only 25% resonably balanced based on the objectives themselves. - Developement is focused more toward re-releasing the original game content for a cash fee than resolving long standing issues and design flaws. - They have been gradually improving the player threat system so it more accurately reflects a persons skill. - The one truly good feature for the game is the character and vehicle design system that allows a high level of customization of look by use of symbols. - Vehicle driving and performance is what you would expect from any game. - Gun mechanics are sloppy and often glitchy. They add unneeded features in a failed attempt to balance weapons. - Limited options for PVP play, you either do missions which have a standard theme or do Fight Club which is basically a moshpit of players killing players with a mission objective of some basic sort. - Developement has issues with breaking things when adding or making 'improvements' slow to never fix issues and glitches.  Overall the game is poorly maintained, poorly developed, and has a good concept with a few nice features. It earns a 4 out of 10  **update 11/20/2015** READ THE AGREEMENT BEFORE YOU INSTALL!!! (all examples provided are paraphrased) Pando part talks about how they are not liable for anything that happens even if it is their fault. Punkbuster part clearly states they have full rights inspect the contents of your Hard Drive, RAM, etc while it is running and even take screenshots which they can use publically. Before that they state it is always running and updates without giving any notice to you which btw anyone who has installed APB before knows it installs a punkbuster windows service that runs all the time in the background unless you manually disabled it. That is but a small taste of what is in that agreement..   I WILL NEVER INSTALL APB AGAIN! I also advise for the safety of your PC and data that you also never install this game!

10125	1	a	the games sucks u need to make an acount because it doesnt use ur steam acount also when u make an acount it desnt even let u pres create new acount ITS SO STUPID
264	1	a	An excellent game with a variety of weapons and customizaion. It's fun when playing with friends, but brace yourself for a community worse than CoD.  This game is an excellent addition to your library, and fun to it's full extent when in a group of friends.
8878	0	a	I quit playing this game when I found out that the 'Devs' were also the same people who were Hackers, who Hacked the game and used their cheats to ruin the game for other people.  There is no customer Support system.  You can send a 'Report' to the company, but, the same people who are the game 'Devs' will recieve it, reject your complaint, and then ask you to shell out more money for a Premium account.  This game was a complete waste of time, and some money.  The only good thing I found in this game was a Clan/Guild, that soon left the game due to Hackers, and the Devs that don't do anything about the Hackers, because they themselves are Hackers, and enjoy tormenting people in PvP with Invulnerable Characters, an are extremely abusive toward the Players. 
7144	0	a	somethings wrong with it. wont let me get on or make an account
7064	0	a	Not the best game mainly because I can't join a server! The game doesn't even let me exit it whilst it's trying to join a server! (alt + tab doesn't even work)
7574	0	a	pay2win game with a â¥â¥â¥â¥ ton of hackers  although it's probably the best of it's genre with the features provided in the game, it's still shitinfested with tons of faggs and a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ dev team  tons of faggs, meaning that the game has probably one of the worst communities in mmo history
9598	0	a	Its fun if you like ammo crafting simulators.
9240	1	a	Fun game to play for about an hour from time to time, but playing it dedicatedly just makes it boring. Bad graphics, but can be looked past. The crafting system is extremely developed and expansive. However, the game is dying at a rapid rate, and losing players, which is a shame considering how fun it used to be around one year ago when I first played it.
10460	1	a	Come Play Fallen Earth I used to play WoW, then I grew up.. Melee is a good way to find me shooting you in the face! If you love to craft and build a character then Fallen EArth is for you. Lastly this is a ! sever game so no hiding, active GM at alll times. Exellent Community of gamers also. Come get some I freaking Dare ya! Edit : No active GMs, game is very much alive, still a vast world to explore. This game requires a high intelligence, reading, thinking and a high amount of patience. Free too play not Play to win and that is always a plus!
1519	1	a	its ok
5620	0	a	i wish i could play it
4918	0	a	This game is a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ worthless dont even waste your time â¥â¥â¥â¥ing trash â¥â¥â¥ game no wonder why its free its free for a reason
7411	0	a	even though i match the minimum requirement for playing, i still cant launch the game from the launcher without getting an error and my computer sounding like its about to explode.
7389	0	a	Was terrible. My Computer is waayyyyyy beyond reccomended specs and I have good internet too. Is nothing like it says it is. Completely pointless
3313	1	a	Fast cars, Sweet guns, and money (that isn't yours) sounds amazing, but when you play the game, you get to live it.
9883	1	a	A great free to play MMO which has elements similar to games like Fallout and Fallout New Vegas, it also gives the choice of third or first person perspective. It also has vehicles such as motorbikes and also horses. A great free to play MMO experience overall.
7925	0	a	Nice grafic, nice idea, but horrible balancing (no balancing) and 100% Pay2Win! If u wanna spend all u'r money, play it! if not, let it be...!
7205	0	a	I love this game, I really do. I just wish it wasn't pay to win, I wish it wasn't so laggy, I wish the cars would turn when I hit the key to turn it and not have a 10 second delay, and I wish there wasn't so many â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s in the servers.
6542	0	a	This game is probably good, but I would never know.  When I installed it the first time and tried to play, I got a PhysX error saying that PhysX was uninitialised by the game. I re-installed my drivers from Nvidia control panel and then tried to get the game going again. Same error popped up. I did this 5 more times. I restarted, I turned off my monitors, I did the hokey pokey, everything. This game is unplayable. I tried to open a support ticket for this, but when I tried to open a ticket there, the page was blank except for the text 'Support is unavailable at this time.'. It's like they don't even want me to play the game. Free to play doesn't mean you can publish â¥â¥â¥â¥ like this. Even if it's free, I was still ripped off.
7252	0	a	no support from the company when you lose money on a purchase do no use
5706	0	a	Pay to win. To many overpowered items and features for people who spill out hundreds of dollars into this game. Was really fun at first but then it got very repetitive.
2603	1	a	Great idea, not great game. Loads of cool thing behind pay walls, some items are pay to win, severs can be lagy and a fair few hackers. Got a mate or two the game can be real fun, other wise it's pretty bad.
4719	0	a	the game wont even start up for me what a waste of my life trying for 1 hour to get this work -1/10
6822	0	a	Really boring and generic
10626	0	a	Kabam is simply a network of greedy â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥es who pay no money for their servers and half the time you get sucked in by oryx, pro or not.
9622	1	a	havent played yet lol
971	1	a	After 9 months without my pc, when I finally got my pc back I started with this game and I realized it that I still â¥â¥â¥â¥ing love this game!!!! I have faith in you G1 please keep the game alive somehow :D
1657	1	a	This game is both good and bad in many ways. Only really great thing is the customization. Servers are awful and very laggy, most of the time. Too many ARMAS weapons, way too many re-skins in the marketplace as well. (even though I have purchased a decent bit from armas) Missions are very repetitive, but who really reads the descriptions of them. The objectives seem to spawn in different areas often, but you may end up with the same actions there. Defend this, raid that, kill the enemy. And this game still has, in my opinion, one of the worst communities in gaming. Do good last mission? Everyone thinks you hack. Did bad? Your a noob. Using a armas gun? Noob. Using a free gun? Hacker. Im not even going to say anything about G1. EA is a better company, and look at what they did with BF4. (I know firsthand the brokenfield 4 problems) If you can ignore the ARMAS marketplace and the servers, APB: Reloaded is worth a try if you like free roam games. Or if you love the idea of playing cops and robbers in a MMO form.
8343	0	a	i can play the game but it keeps crashing and i dont know why
8371	0	a	Used to be fun :( Community=toxic Devs=money hungry Waste of time and money to play it now.
2617	1	a	Its Gta Online 
1360	1	a	.
340	1	a	I love this game, it reminds me a lot of the Saints Row games. If you like pvp and shooters I would recommend this one. I'm still VERY new to this game, I'm learning the basics at the moment but I play this game a lot. Its tons of fun!
5293	0	a	this game is for â¥â¥â¥â¥boys
8997	1	a	This game takes time and lots of grinding to higher levels, and it is difficult as if you where actually in an apocolypse. This game is very fun if you are able to get past the fact that the story is everywhere and the constant need for better equipment and materials. Though personally if you get a few friends and play through the game it makes things alot more fun for all involved.
10296	1	a	i dowloaded it....everything was fine and then i got to the start menu. i pressed the button to create a ew account repeatedly and it didnt work. 
9095	1	a	This game is unique, and the best FREE MMO Post Apocalyptic Game there is in my opinion.  What can you do in it ?: well alot of things. you have a huge in game map to go where ever you want and explore and not Just one map but a bunch of them. it is A PvE And PvP game so you wont lack any action of killing other people and ofc Those that feel blood is not for them got nothing to be scared off they can just stay away of the PvP area's You can Craft Alot of things ! (Alot of em) from small things such as ammo and up too cars and horses or wapons. you wont get bored Trust me on that. And now for the part that makes it Stand out from the rest of the MMO games is that it got an incredible Stable currency at the Aucation unlike any other MMO's wich there currency at market places/Aucation houses is Ridiculous To say the least. this game is perfect for people who look for that Apocalyptic game in wich they free to do What they want and go where they want (its best to play with friends) there are factions wich fight each other over Points of control on the map Did i say that this game is not a Pay To Win Game ?! Hell yeah you dont have to pay money Just to be able to even have a chance vs someone who did pay for the dlc for an example (Winterfall) to all of those who Say it is too hard to get chips in the game (the in game money) all you have to do is go to the Aucation house see what is In high demand and figure out the best way to get it and sell it after you do that a few times you can go to just Buy at low Cost and sell at higher prise to make profit* (My Tip is for free ^_^ ).  Now it is true that this game is not as popular as it was a few years ago and in my opinion it is sad and pity. for such a Game to go to waste because of people crying about how hard it is or complain about some small bugs well i have news For you there are no games with no bugs. we are all humans and we make mistakes and im sure that even now there Team is working hard to fix them all. And since its a FREE TO PLAY GAME i dont think anyone got the right to criticize the Team for being lazy for maintaining a FREE TO PLAY game.
8646	0	a	Extremely p2w
5688	0	a	Its good and if you like challenging opponents be my guest, but there is too many hackers.
8708	0	a	Overall? A massive disappointment I came back to a couple times in hopes it had gotten better. Sadly, it never did.  Such a shame, I loved being a wheelman for people.
8742	0	a	trying to get a sniper spot and BOOM teammate kill me.   I am protecting a case from being stolen and BOOM teammate throw grenade on me  trying to chase enemy and BOOM teammate blocking my way and kill me.  Instead of say sorry they laughing at me.  conclusion; Never play this mothaâ¥â¥â¥â¥ing APB   
8189	0	a	high population servers lag.the slowest loading game ever hit detection needs work.pay to win.....
293	1	a	Best game ever made.... With some exeptions.
6266	0	a	Played it.. sucks. Too many things happening, crappy controls, ugly graphics.. not worth 'Free to Play'
8910	1	a	If this game is next gen then I am building a Delorean and â¥â¥â¥â¥ing myself with it's tailpipe. This game is so gay it makes my â¥â¥â¥â¥ smaller, even though asian woman want that on their feet, I don't. I will literally â¥â¥â¥â¥ in a cup and â¥â¥â¥â¥ that â¥â¥â¥â¥ with my tongue then finger it to hell. I would rather suck my own â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of my 2 buttcheeks than play in the garbage that makes me â¥â¥â¥â¥ myself twelve times from sunday morning.
2844	1	a	Alot of fun! Competitive, alot of room to be creative, and is a good challenge to constantly be on your game and get the advantage over your enemies, I love playing this game, it's personally my favorite free to play game on Steam
3898	0	a	ok so this was my all time favorite game on steam  even with its p2w features, i liked the game  you can make tons of friends while playing it  why i dont recommend you say?  well for some unknown reason they banned me, i sent a ticket asking why and they responded with 'your acc has been permanently disabled'  500+ 200hr on this game just to get banned  The game itself is a fun game, G1 doesnt care about the game, all they want is money  Pros and cons in my point of view Pros +customization +lots of guns +lots of cars +decent sized map to play  Cons -p2w -hackers -G1 -p2w -G1 -and some more hackers  PS. i would have recommended this game if they had not done me dirty.  -G1
2688	1	a	Great game
6628	0	a	Bad Community, Bad Servers, Good Game. Don't play without doing so with someone expirienced.
10316	0	a	This game actually sucks. I thought it would be really cool but ended up having a game-freezing bug every time a door opened. 1/10
7915	0	a	Before, this game was great. Good community, good updates. Now it's the complete opposite.  Unless you want to play the same thing over and over, same mission and what not, go ahead. But it's as bland as plain oatmeal. Usually the maximum of 7 people on fighting districts. The only thing that's good is the exit button.
854	1	a	Poor mans GTA with twice the cancer. Devs don't care and community is very poor. This however, has kept me entertained for quite a while. So it may work for you. Just don't sink any money into this, its not worth it.
2136	1	a	Great, fun and creative game with friends!
4158	0	a	tiggs ruined the game
6421	0	a	I have a good pc but cant run?
6579	0	a	~This review was original a recommended review for this game on 22 May, 2012~ The worlds best Free game.  ~New Review 2014, June~ I spend so many hours on this game that's unbeliveable. We have gone through bad times, good times, we've cried together, laughed together, and just been together since RTW release. I've meet new friends, found enemies, rivals which I've had so much fun with, when we found each other against each other again after days. And I've now came to the point, that this game is a zero. After Gamersfirst took over this masterpiece, is jumped down a hole where it hasn't hit the ground yet, and it's just a matter of time till the ground is visible. After every release, the game gets more and more bugs, and the server performance is getting worse. It's so hard for me to down vote this game, but.. I would lie if I did anything else.  Pros; - Had a lot of potential. - Had one of the best playerbases I've seen.  Cons; - Performance. - Servers. - Support. - The AI's - G1 is not willing to listen to the community, and is basicly ignoring them. - Only content updates, and rebates for their items which cost real money. - Outdated Anti-cheat program. - Outdated game-engine, 'Dosen't matter that much to me, but a upgrade would help them optimizing the performance'.  *At this point I just hope that G1 are willing to sell it, to a company who will safe it, while it's still falling down the hole, even though I think it's to late*
2241	1	a	Conclusion from an 4 years veteran playing from 2012 (200 hrs on steam but over 1000 on gamersfirst) :  Customazation is sick, by sick i mean very good and you can customize every single part of your car/clothes. The game isnt pay-to-win how others say, you can buy everything with in game cash and contacts maxed out. OP weapons that can be buyed with real money? YES, but the game isnt ptw at all. I never spent money on this game and i played for 4 years. The game is fun with friends/clan/groups, without them if you go solo there are chances to lose because of bad teammates. The community in-game is toxic but on the forums its really helpful. The servers are practically 'sh*t'. Lag spikes everywhere for medium PCs and connection problems. The developers arent the best either, they want to come with a new engine upgrade (hope that this will fix lag spikes) but we havent heard anything from them ever again. I can understand them as before gamersfirst took over the game from REALTIME WORLDS they had a bunch load of prgrammers..and now with GAMERSFIRST there is only a Lead programmer who is forced to learn the way the programmers before him coded. The games has much potential but GAMERSFIRST is kinda broken. If you want to enjoy a game like GTA, APB is the thing for you but dont spend too much time or money on it, as i assume this game will shut down somewhere in the near future and your progression will be lost. This is my conclusion over the years. Lets all hope APB will be the same as it was before GAMERSFIRST took it over. I rly recommand it if you like GTA games so i will give it a YES!
2005	1	a	Overall good,graphics are good,even if you lower it,customizations is cool,aiming is a bit weird,driving is very bad,i prefer playing on foot,as for playing mission,well for a new player it's really hard to figure out what to do &amp; where to go...when playing in multiplayer,the cool thing is that it doesn't lag even if your internet is slow...so it's 6/10
5695	0	a	if ur on a mac dont even think about getting it cus iam on mac a i want the game and whoever made it make the game for mac
4772	0	a	I played this when it was just APB, remember RTW?, yeh that long ago. It was flawed but fun then, When G1 got it, it well went downhill fast, everything is P2W,sooo many hackers and very unstable servers. Also if you log out by cancelling the game by task manager or Alt+Tabing you get banned for hacking...   DO NOT BUY, its ruined.
2475	1	a	I like this game. I really do. If any of you want to play it as a cop please let me know because sadly it is a game that takes more than one person to play right.
3533	1	a	a good cops vs crime game but it is very odd also it is confusing for new players includeing me but i like the open world also it reminds me of saints row 2      scoring------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Note This game is ran on a lower end pc        look 8/10 this aint no gta 5 Gameplay 9/10 it is very fun and silly Restricteveness 10 for most restrictive 1 for least 4/10 restricting at the begining  overall 8.999999999999/10  i recommend this game and it is even better with frends  if you have any   also i probaly have typos heck even in this sentince
736	1	a	Great game but only when u have Better graphics card..
5376	0	a	it doesnt load and it crashs alot
8968	1	a	Obviously it's getting a good review, 341 hours at the time of writing this.  I can't think of another game I have wasted such a large portion of time on than this one. It's a great game, I suggest you at least try it and play until you're level 15. If it hasn't captivated you by then it won't.
9478	1	a	quick fun... I recommend it if you are looking for an ONLINE version of FALLOUT. I am surprised that BETHESDA hasn't come out with an all online game version of the storyline FO (Fallout Online)...lol...But this will fill in the void for now if that is what you are looking for.
9205	1	a	Tedious
3554	1	a	.WiN. I agreed your message......... This was my very favorite A.P.B. - Saints Row game, from then to now. Now, I stopped playing this game. Why, because of hack-cheaters &amp; traiting your team-mates, and extra is they not fixing this game system, just crap they put out. Ignoring us from them G.M. developers not caring about our feelings for a community we were in. -- Sighs -- This game will end to it's very own soul, and gone for goodness sakes when this go in a shut-down in the future, I hope..........
694	1	a	This is a great game if you can with stand the trashy community. Overall, there's quite a bit of things that need fixing, and are currently in the process of being fixed.   It has countless amounts of replay-ability and can easily be considered one of the most addicting games i've played.   Customizability is great, however they continue to offer a premium service (Which is kinda needed.)   The market place system makes it seem as though the game is pay to win, but overall it's not. You need to put a lot of time into this game to have an enjoyable experience. And by enjoyable i do not mean crashing cars into other cars until they explode.  If i were to give this game a rating out of ten, at least an 8/10.  It's worth the try and if you can't seem to get into it, well, find something else thats up your alley.
7726	0	a	I'm afraid that I found this game sparse on content, and without progression. You do not get to keep anything- only rent it for a time, and that means that in a few weeks, you are back where you started, regardless.
4509	0	a	For the love of god, don't play this game..
494	1	a	Great game. You should try it :3
9435	0	a	Weird movement mechanics
10580	0	a	How to play step 1. play game for a few mins  step 2.uninstall
6781	0	a	got it never played it maby when i first got it  not a good game
3583	1	a	its ok i guess... 
5036	0	a	This game is HUGE P2W(Pay to win) Note: I used to have the game before It came on steam  Now here is some good stuff and bad staff about the game  Bad Stuff: 1. The game really wants you to throw their money your money at them, while at the same time they try to seem generous 2. Just about all the good guns need to be bought,Including cars and clothes with Real money 3. Everyone who DOES pay for guns, are Way too Over Powered or just do really insane damage 4. You need to spend a ridiculous amount of hours to get enough cash for weapons that are DECENT,by that I mean guns that dont need 3 clips to kill someone  Good Stuff: 1. The games custimaztion is Pretty fun and you can make just about anything, Unless you â¥â¥â¥â¥ out money 2. The game has a nice healthy player base and there is rarley any hackers, but sometime the players who pay look like hackers..... 3. It isnt to graphicly demanding, so you dont need a high end graphics card to run this game at high settings  Overall, â¥â¥â¥â¥ing paid to win or spend a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥on of hours getting money to get good guns
9380	0	a	poor graphix would acceptable with a free game if the controls didnt suck especially hard.
5406	0	a	ShÂitty servers. P2W. Just get a sub @  www.artiÂfiÂciaÂlaiÂming.net  and rage all day long, that's the only use of this game until they fix it.
9881	0	a	monotonous and boring. also a cash cow pay to win.
6417	0	a	Full of microtransactions, gameplay isnt anything you will totally like, the only thing i really like on this game is that you can be in the same car with your mate, and drive over buggy no life city, fighting against op god like people that has bought good weapons for real money. 4/10
6762	0	a	The game wont work !!!!! PLEASE HELP
1067	1	a	Have Fun Killing and stealing on game 'I recommend This Game.'

4073	0	a	I tried it - and i really wanted to love it. But it sucks - hard :I Also: russian cheaters - russian cheaters everywhere
2735	1	a	The best MMO shooter ive ever played! Honestly the game is mostly about customization! If you like amazing games then play this!
2906	1	a	Why do I keep coming back to this game? I honestly can call this my first MMO RPG
1433	1	a	One of My Favourite Games Ever. Great Graphics. A Nice Community. Awesome Maps. Never Gets Boring. And On Top Of All We Can Do lmost Everything.
7028	0	a	The game is VERY cool and funny, BUT it have 2 things that totally SUCKS:  -The matchking, u may play against players with LOTS of reputation ( levels ) more than you, i was 59 and i was matched against people with R 149, 229, etc, SUCKS!  -The weapons store, i have just 4 days playing and i have to play against people with more experience AND premium weapons, that means perfect damage, aiming, lots of bullets, etc, and they earn double exp and money than normal people, i understand its common you can buy premium isues BUT the difference between premium and normal is too high, the premium moddified weapons are so stupidly overpowered .   So, if you have money to buy premium stuff, welcome! enjoy it! but if you dont, dont even try this game, because ur only going to lose.
3306	1	a	Ambitious, that's for sure, with plenty of insane customizability, but overly-high system requirements and unsatisfying gunplay will undoubtedly see this game die. Again.
6604	0	a	APB was totally perfect when the original developers and publishers released it. However they wen't bankrupt because not enough people payed the Â£40 subscription requred to play in 2010. After that gamersfirst bought it off the original company and it's known as APB Reloaded now with it still having all the features which it originally had and even a little more new features I do not recommend it because it is heavily P2W. You still can play it however you won't get the good guns, perks, vehicles and unlimited customisation if you don't pay. It's a great game but it's not worth playing unless you're ready to pay for things. Review is based on personal expericence and opinion. I've played since launch, rebirth on gamersfirst and steam.
1458	1	a	i like garbage games and this one is my favorite
5579	0	a	Hello all, im italian but im want to give my comments in Enghish, so many people can look this comments becuse  Enghish is a international language, so take some time to read all this can help you in some way. Im start to play in 2010 when the game start, was good and cool and im play for, well im don't remember now, for 4 or 5  years. This game is become like a â¥â¥â¥â¥, is a pay to win, sometime when i was play i become angry, frustration, sad. Sometime i was play with some friend and we have good moments. I play and im know well how to play, i become so much time rank gold, i never buy weapons, and never buy in the shop. The problem of the game are this 1) Pay to win. 2) Sometime Lag. (also sometime when you drive car is uncontrollable) 3) Hacker and cheater. 4) oh my god, what is all this clothes in the shop all the time ? is like APB is become a fashion game, where people do  parade of fashion. 5) if you win the people say you are a hacker, cheater, idiot, you don't know how to play 6) if you lose, the people say you are a loser, noob, you don't know how to play 7) so community is like a cancer, everyone hates everyone 8) in my opinion administrators of game, don't care about kick cheater out the game 9) unbalanced challenges, in sever bronze you find silver, in sever silver, you find gold, how you can play if you are  silver, and you find gold player ?  listen, if you want try this game, don't try, if you play this game, and you get angry, frustration and sad, stop to play like  me. Not worth the effort play a â¥â¥â¥â¥ game, if the only think can give to you is Health problems.  Marco
5101	0	a	A complete waste of time with faulty matchups, unexplained gameplay and aspects of the game specifically designed to taunt you.
10539	1	a	Fun and interesting game. Definitely worth a try!
4061	0	a	The only way you could have fun is by paying the micro transactions. All in all, this is pay 2 win.
1039	1	a	The lag on this game is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing joke, it actually just makes you angry when you play because the server is so crap it can't handle the game itself. you get good days and bad but really, Don't drop a single cent into this game as I made the mistake of doing, you'll get owned by aimbotters who don't care if they get banned because they just create new free accounts and start all over again. I just played a game now after some time and wow, the lag made me want to throw my laptop into a wall.
363	1	a	One of my favorite multiplayer games of all time. Even after almost 4 years I still enjoy it. And G1 is clearing out the closet hackers and all the new hackers pretty fast now. If the community would just clean up and be patient for the new engine, we've got ourself one hell of a game. The game isn't Pay2Win either. The default STAR is in the top 10 guns in the game due to its easy use. It's mainly skill, luck, and positioning. Take your time with this games immense learning curv, meet the positive community members, and have a blast with some friends while making new ones.
10850	1	a	This game is str8 up baller yo

5234	0	a	this game honestly sucks. it took me 2 hours to download. then i had to make an entire other registration. and it still wont play. please save the time and dont download
5903	0	a	sory that game cant even start normal and i have new PC
8836	0	a	p2w, one of the worst communities ever. would not recommend.
3314	1	a	This is not a 'pay2win' game. I have played for several months now and it is laggy but I am using a computer that was born 2009. My friend plays on a recent build and gets no lag at all.   Pros: Challenging Customization is great Upload your music too Make music for themes or songs Fairfight banning hackers(woohoo)  Cons: Not enjoyable on older computers(laggy)  This is an awesome game to get into but if you love winning every time then maybe it is not for you. You still level up, earn money, and unlock items even when you lose. So, give it try. If you don't like it you can always uninstall.  Update due to other reviews I have seen: You can always play while events are going on and get prizes (like premium) and use them to create whatever you want (tattoos, car decals, and such). It will still be there when the premuim expires. :)

10413	0	a	Can't update with a 12mb/s. Very afraid about this, i play this game few years ago and it was a good game..
10455	0	a	well mixed views on this game, it's ambitous,but is still buggy, i enjoyed this game to start with, the wide crafting options often leave you daunted. but it's the crafting which makes this game great, mobs don't drop gear, they drop crafting mats...in fact crafting mats are everywhere,so if you want to roam the wasteland with an uber gun at low levels..then go play fallout3/new vegas, cos it aint gonna happen...unless you buy from the cash shop or have a rich friend in game, you wont get any real decent automatic weapons till lvl 10-15.....'lvl 10-15 you say?' yea...it'll take a while to get to lvl 10..and then you need to craft it...not as easy at it sounds,but there is always the auction house for your overpriced guns and gear. oh and pvp is so bloody broken on this game it's not even worth going into, lack of endgame/expansion content means once you are lvl 40+ this game gets old and boring real fast, not that you'll ever reach lvl 40+ , you'll get bored and decide to play new vegas by lvl 20.
5424	0	a	So I found this game maybe in 2011. I played it first as criminal, didnt like it, changed to cop. Crminals are easy money faction, because you can ram with stolen van on store, get the stuff, sell them and change money to clean ones. Cops are also very fun because you can 'chase' random ppl for nothing sirens on to â¥â¥â¥â¥ them off. (Ramming included) Now let's get to + and - parts  Pros +Character customization and car customization totally in in-game money (easy to get too) +You can look like a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and be a cop at same time. +A lot of emblems to create for your character and some people can make amazing ones. +Trolling as cop Cons -PunkBuster, I call it PunkCluster. -Those who pay, gain TOTALLY OVERPOWERED advantage with their premium shottys. (Not much of those though on lvl1) -Very limited amount of character custom clothes if not paying. -On level 50 (like me) I got sniper (kills in 2 shots) shoot a guy 2 times, he teleports and kills me from 200 m with premiumshotty. -Servers sometimes really laggy and disconnecting.  So why I said no? Well I like this game a lot and REALLY recommend it for you, why not, its free, but personally, after 4 years, having 5 month pauses, I don't enjoy it. That's why. But that doesn't mean YOU don't enjoy it, I'm not here to say 'You can play this, you can't play this', i'm here to give my opinion. Thanks.
3660	1	a	My thing wont update so i cant play!?
5775	0	a	the game tend to go repetitive after a while, there pay 2 win guns that can easily overpower normal ones even tho u can get them in game playing which it will take ages literally. there performance issue with some pc mostly Fps laggs. Uninstalled due to poor matchmaking in game.
5026	0	a	The game would be fun if i didnt get destroyed everytime i joined a match/mission because everyone is decked out in strong gear and demolishes me as someone with almost no gear because i just started the game.
4777	0	a	Reloaded Productions put themselves i.e. ca$h over the community, don't bother.
4594	0	a	Pay To Win {PTW} .. i played this game when it was in beta and loved it in the begining when you have 'no packs ' to buy or as we say not PAY TO WIN ... but now if you played lets say 1000 hr and you did not spend any money in the game ... you will have less â¥â¥â¥â¥ and worst luck than a guy played this game for 10hr who payed 500$ in the game already .... yes .. if you have money you have skilles and if not you suck and this is the reality of this game .
7989	0	a	Worst Pay to Win game that is.  You can't do any single mission without having a guy on the enemy team with a yellow sniper rifle that has shiny sparkles with bunny ears that do one shot dead.
565	1	a	A lot of fun awaits you in APB if you have a team of friends to play it with. Customization options are incredible. Nothing feels better than putting a naughty tattoo on your body and shock the serious players with it. On the other hand, it is pay2win, stereotypic and matchmaking is sometimes unfair. But I appreciate that anybody can try it for free. 7,5/10  What's there to hate about this review?? :D I wonder.. Tell me in the comment section in stead of monkey clicking the thumb down. I want to know, because I want to improve.
6466	0	a	Why does it say mostly positive if most of it is not recommended. This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥
6218	0	a	If you are looking for a pay to win game then you have come to the right game!!
5228	0	a	Its ok but not quite there to much pay 2 win
219	1	a	If saints row 2 and gta 3 had a baby 
4790	0	a	Nearly all of the hours I have in this are updates.
1020	1	a	Jumped off a building and went through the ground and got banned for 'Exploiting'. 9000/9001
8893	0	a	Well, despite the fact I have 101.9 hours playing this game on Steam, I am a veteran that played it almost 2-3 years, when it became F2P (yes, this game was once paid), stopped for a period of 5 years, and came back to play again. So my review will have lots of comparisons with the former years I've played.  Long story short: Actual state of the game is almost --dead--. No other word to define it. Few players (barely 60-70), counting with the newer players that come slowly in numbers. The peak number of players, I suppose, never reached 200 or maybe 250. You will understand that this number is important when you know the HUGE extension of map.  I will now point the most important details that will explain my veredict:   OBS.: It is a HUGE text with plenty of details. You were warned.   1. Features and Gameplay  Fallen Earth implements very nice features, specially in terms of crafting and item reuse in crafting, that means, sometimes you need a specific craftable item to craft a better one. So, you won't waste a ton of items just to grind th hell of your crafting skill and throw away all â¥â¥â¥â¥ you built to the air as it wasn't important. It was (when there was a handful of players around), now it is NOT anymore.  Gameplay is still kinda robotic, with some need for grinding. Yeah, it is not a freaking grind, because there are plenty of missions, and most of them, are related OR with the linear storyline, or with a sidestory that reflects one specific situation, like, the reason of a decaying state of a city, per example. So you don't need to kill thousands of mutants to just earn levels. Just do the missions.  The need of teamwork only is vital on the last level (55) when you reach a region called Alpha County, where the mobs are very difficult to beat alone, specially if you're a full crafter. On some middle-level bosses there is also one need of teamwork, but mainly, after you reach 55. And it has no meaning because the missions in Aplha County give mostly chips (ingame money), experience (that you won't need as you've reached the cap) and, a few of those missions, faction reputation. So, in a basis, no one does those missions because there is no need to do so.  2. Missions  As I've said, the missions are quite well made, and have some history behind (some of them). But indeed they're very straightforward (kill x wolves, collect y materials, destroy z element). There are no puzzles, nothing that could difficult the conclusion of a mission except for one or another boss that has a big pool of health and so you need some friends to finish it. Apart from that, easy missions, nothing spectacular, nothing puzzling. Just normal missions that follows one sidestory or the main storyline.  The only exception are the Defense Towns, where there is a mission to maintain one player-built town (it has 4 in total in game) and, from time to time, a big raid distributed in various waves appear to storm this city. The mission asks you and the other players to defend the town and counter this raid. Remember teamwork? If you don't have it, you lose the city, the city that you and other players built, and can rebuild again if lose. Why that? What's the advantage? Resource nodes around the town, plenty of them appears depending on which buildings were constructed. Trust me, it worths.  3. Crafting  Here is the jewel of the game, and I really thumbs up for this. The game has a complex crafting system, where you have a wide range of melee weapons (hammers, pickaxes, slesgehammers and even a big bar with a 40kg weight), ranged weapons (pistols, revolvers, rifles, shotguns, rocket launchers), various armors and clothes, food and drink, buildings (generally temporary, except from Defense Town buildings), vehicles parts and vehicles assemble, live mounts (horses and wolves), medicine items, poisons, grenades, bombs. The variety is damn extensive, and everything has its purpose: help you against the dangers of the Wastes (including other players). Full crafters have some fun unlocking complex recipes and distribute the products for your clanmates or the open market (Auction house), and this is one thing Fallen Earth still maintains on a positive stats.  4. PvP  The PvP on this game has a freaking damn potential, because it is firmed in one thing: the Faction Wheel. First things first: on a determined level, you need to choose a faction. There are six, i won't go into details, but if you choose one, you start to build some reputation with the faction (throught certain missions) you chose mainly, and with two other factions on a lower basis. On the other side, the other three becomes your enemies (your reputation with them diminshes on the same amount you earn for your faction and allies).  Inside the huge territory of FE, there are PvP areas with outposts or keeps, where a faction that takes control of that keep, rules the area, and has some benefits, including special resource nodes and the option to lay down harvesters (resource drillers). When the game had a big amount of active players (5 years ago), the fight for power was so imense AND insane, that keeps and fortresses normally were conquered and reconquered within one or two hours (counting that it has 45 minutes of immunity after it is capped).  The actual state of PvP is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, because there are not enough players to maintain an all-out war or a domination war over the PvP areas. You even find one or other flag caps, but nothing near the PvP state of 5 years ago.  5. The company (Gamers First)  I could say a bunch of bad things about G1, because, there are mostly only bad things about them related to FE. Suffice to say, when G1 bought FE from Reloaded Productions/Icarus Studios and changed the business model to F2P, a massive number of players quit the game on the next weeks, they knew what exactly would happen with the game, even with the fact Reloaded team would keep working on the game changes and new expansions. G1's legacy in turn one succesful game in â¥â¥â¥â¥ is long and bold. Just ask the players of APB: Reloaded how the game is now. FE isn't an exception: the only news we, FE players, see are the Subscribers Rewards every month, mostly. Fallen Earth became, for G1, another reasonable source of money from subs, veteran players who still manage to like the game despite the lack of improvement over the years (only one new map expansion, a few new vehicles and gear and a new PvE coop mode called The Dome, all this in 5 years ... FIVE YEARS!!!!). What I could say to G1?? Follow the example of Keen Software House and 'Space Engineers' game title. One update every week, either bug fixings or new improvements, EVERY WEEK FOR BLESSED 1 and 1/2 YEARS!!  Conclusion  I'd say, if you want one good experience of free open world game, you can even try Fallen Earth. It is a nice experience. You can still get addicted, but BE SURE that the end game, from the day of that review, is frustrating. To be very honest, the word that resumes all my experience from 5 years ago and now is this:  frustration . But well, I have friends on this game, so that's why I still play. And the game has some nice features (thanks to Icarus Studios) I do study to develop something similar, so that's why I play. But, after all, considering the whole product and its actual state, I do NOT recommend the game.
8253	0	a	I've played this when they first came out, even before on steam. THE GAME I LOVED IT!!!! COULD not stop playing both of the sides for 2weeks!! Then hackers started poppin out of building and walls. I waited to see if they will be gone  or atelast most of em but NOPE!!!!! gets worse n worse.. so i said F*K this n never played this EVER again.
2414	1	a	Sometimes you just want to drive around with sirens on and thats pretty much why I keep playing lol. Besides that though its just fun to run around do missions with friends and taunting other players over the mic. Sometimes you even make friends with the competition! Also the customization options are amazing and why I fell in love with this game in the first place back since the Realtime World days. The possibilities are endless as long as you have the imagination for it.
8196	0	a	thank you it say im play the game whem i arent and i cant uninstall it or play a different game
9344	1	a	pretty fun game when playing with friends. but there are lots of difficult and complicated if you dont play it enough... plus its really hard to get vehicles so if your new your stuck in one place........
10640	1	a	It's aight for me. But you can literally play this on the dank web itself. :/. So why download it
4787	0	a	played about 10 hours, i didn't enjoy it, but as it is free it was worth it
6839	0	a	Buy GTAV Instead
7787	0	a	So let's get this rolling.  This game is addictive as â¥â¥â¥â¥ due to being just so much fun at the lower levels but when you progress your threat changes and you will be placed with much harder opponents. The problem is there is no required level for this threat, meaning low level players can reach the highest threat level and then they are for the most part â¥â¥â¥â¥ed. You face enemies that have so much stuff or spend real money on the game that you just get face rolled.   Which doesn't help the match making, that's broken as â¥â¥â¥â¥. At late game you get placed into such unfair matches that it releases the devil inside you. Placing you in games with unbalanced amount of players or threat level. We were two silver threat levels playing against 2 highest level gold threat players and being facerolled.  Then there is the problem of Pay 2 Win. This game has the most OP Pay to win system I have ever seen. You can buy the max level guns and items at any level, meaning you get players just owning you at lower threats and levels. These guns can be obtained (Sort of) at the highest level but just think for a moment, low level players with end game guns....  Now for servers. The servers are for the most part fine, the problem is the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing way the game uses the servers. Almost everything is server side, so lag? Tough â¥â¥â¥â¥. You're going to crash and backtrack the whole time, also the server side thing doesn't work for international players as they have delayed â¥â¥â¥â¥ing everything. Delayed controls on vehicles, delayed hit detection, delayed death and damage. Making the game feel like a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥.  The Weapons in the game are for the most part good except for the OP Premium guns that are sold on the market. The guns expire every 10 days and they don't cost a high amount but the problem is that the Guns you pay â¥â¥â¥â¥ing money for also expire, although the period is 30 days instead of 10. So when you come back after taking a break from the game, you'll find out that you have no weapons and have thrown more money at the game to unlock those weapons that are required to even win matches.  The game's customization is simply amazing, the company that owns the game host events for artists to create new works of art for the game and if they win they get allowed to sell it on the premium store, but the problem here is you have to pay to be able to make anything. That's right, you have to pay for fonts, icons, decals and much more to be able to make something. Anyway to skip that part is to buy vehicles or clothes that are on the market and have been customized. Lastly there is the way this game makes you rage, with the lag and the pay 2 win style, the most anoying part is when you die, you get played a taunt from the enemy that can be really â¥â¥â¥â¥ing anoying. This game has made me rage so much on my friends that we stopped playing it.  In the end, I wonder why I even played this game for so long.
7398	0	a	Totally waste of time... Free to Play games should be banned from Steam....grinding and money draining as we are going to work to be ripped off whilst spending some time with our hobby! If you want do do a favour to yourself leave F2P games to old people on Mobile Phones!
217	1	a	about the game: The good, the bad and the ugly  The good:  -there is no other game like it -its not pay2win,the most powerful weapons are free -awezome costumization of character, symbols and cars  The bad:  -HUGE skill diference between players (check notes at the end of the review) -every now and then a patch buffs a weapon that was not supposed to get buffed. -a few times missions needs balancing (drop points or timers will give an advantage to one of the teams)  The ugly:  -toxic community (not recommended for people that gets offended easly - might learn how to ignore toxic people if you survive enought in this game) (there is nice people, but the toxic people makes a lot of noise in this game) -its a third person shooter. it plays completely diferent from a first person shooter. so if you're used to CoD or CS, you will have to get used to a completely diferent kind of game.  Notes:  -it looks like g1 is working hard now to finish the engine upgrade - give them time. a lot of players are tired of waiting for it since it was announced some years ago, but they have now another company putting some pressure on them. also, it looks like they want to balance things out.  -in this game, you recibe a threat level (it indicates how good you play). green,bronze,silver and gold. you're put automatically inside a district that is supposed to gather players from the same threat level. for (reasons), this doesnt happend. silver district is full of golds and bronze district is full of silvers. this creates something interesting: 2 worlds. the bronze district, where bronze and silvers hang out, a more newbie friendly place to learn the game. and the silver district, full of silvers that likes to take a big challange and golds. the silver districts will be hell on earth for all new players, they will be put against very strong oposition and wont have any chance of winning. yet, silvers and golds of the bronze district wont be as good and strong as silvers of the silver district.  -the matchmaking system needs some work (its scheduled for rework after the engine update) it will work with whatever is on the district you're in. that means sometimes you will be fighting oposition way stronger than you, or way weaker than you. its something you have to get used to.  -because of newbies being put against veterans, 2 things happends: 1- people start thinking there are a lot of hackers in this game (false - if we put a silver in CS:GO against a global elite and dont tell him anything, he will think the global elite is hacking) and 2- it looks like the game is P2W (again, false - most powerful weapons are free. but old players like to have permanent nice looking weapons, so they buy one with real money. as they have a lot more experience, they will always win the gunfights, and the new players tend to blame the gun for that)  -you will need some patience to learn the game, its a diferent and unique kind of game. but if you know wich districts to be on your skill level, its a fun game, and worth it
5948	0	a	6 gb of loading screen,bugs and pay2win i coundnt even play the game, i tried 4 times nothing so if you like loading screens this game is for you
10805	1	a	Best dank meme simulator with bullets since TF2.  12/11 
5003	0	a	They need to add some servers for Australians. I wish I could thumbs up, but I can't stay in a game long enough to enjoy it.
4972	0	a	horribly optomized, literally took 14 minutes and 34 seconds to launch. too much water ign.
9270	0	a	Another game that isn't made for Steam and should NOT be on Steam. Comes with it's own launcher with the most excrement like interface.  Requires account to be made.  Had only to jump through 100 hoops before I could play: Open with Steam -&gt; launcher -&gt; create account -&gt; opens website -&gt; create account -&gt; launcher login -&gt; launcher agreements -&gt; luncher checks local content just downloaded with steam -&gt; launcher downloads updates (although I just downloaded it from Steam) -&gt; open with steam -&gt; login with launcher -&gt; launcher agreements -&gt; check for updates -&gt; play  Horrendous movement, poor graphics, very very very unintuitive.   Couldn't make it past the first quest, so bad...

6436	0	a	I once loved this game, now i feel ashamed. This game had promise but ended up in development hell. They spent 100$+ million on this game and this is the results of a game with idiotic planning and promise. If they focused more on clan/faction battles AND pvp this may just been a little better.   Rest in peace 2011-2014 \'Pay2win â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ you\'
10221	1	a	alsome game
10475	1	a	I love crafting systems. Man, do I ever love good crafting systems in game. And what better then a game about the post apocolyse to really shine in this department? There is nothing quite as rewarding as savaging through mounds of garbage, collecting various long rusted do-dads, and long forgotten whats-its to make various deadly weapons to gut, barrage, or otherwise eviscerate various pus drooling mutants.  Okay, so the crafting is still varily limited. But compared to most MMORPGS it is still rather 'up there' on the scale of awesome. Combine that with real time FPS combat (which still boils down to a-typical pulling and grinding, admitably) and you got yourself some fun times.  The game is rather graphic intensive, but after kicking the graphics down even my laptop with it's outdated drivers and such was capable of running it releatively smoothly. Grab a friend, get your horse and hit the waste! It's time to launch your career as a down and dirty, gun toting scavager!
4052	0	a	A Dreadful P2Win game that isnt even remotley balanced. New players will find it damn near impossible to even go toe to toe with oposing faction. Server experiences frequent and crippling rubbanding lag.

10641	1	a	Just hours and hours of game play, so many things to do..... i cant stop playing it
6146	0	a	It's fun when you ram raid, but missions aren't. Most of the time, you verse high ranking, high threat people, who tote OP Pay To Win weapons. There are also people who camp on streets and witness you doing a ram raid, and farm you for kills, stealing any money not taken to a Money Laundrey. Performance issues are a big problem, and no Australian servers, just Hong Kong NA East, West. This game has been revived by many companies and has recently got a new anti-hack system, but to be honest, it's not worth saving. 45%

2667	1	a	This game is pretty cool for a realistic shooter.. doing crime is fun I haven't tried the Police yet.. its a bit too hard to shoot other players and I rarly played it enough for all the space it took on my pc so i uninstalled.. it was Enjoyable tho

9646	0	a	I got it and it seemed it had a cool concept (post-apopolyptic mmo) but I got bored very quick after the first part of the game.
1930	1	a	
10277	1	a	10 out of 10, since it was released in 2009 still one of the best post-apocalyptic MMORPG of all time! I recommend for anyone who likes Fallout or similar games and for every people who wants a new taste of mmorpg! The graphics are not as the same as a new released mmorpg but the gameplay and the roleplay is magnificent! Try it out, and have fun!
2752	1	a	I recommend this with the stipulation that your computer is better than average. This is a performance-intensive game, but it is worth it. The city of San Paro is beautiful, and the customization options you have for your characters and vehicles are remarkable. When a massive traffic jam causes problems, it can make for engaging gameplay - or it can bog down a subpar RAM setup.  It's a freemium game that under-delivered on the promises made by the original APB. While it is not a perfect game by any stretch, the interactions and gunfight scenarios available to you in the given setting are fantastic. This was GTA Online before there was a GTA Online. It's worth trying, at the very least.
514	1	a	Very good game, but owners are bad. It can be the most played game ever but G1( R.I.P.) Prepare yourself on server lags and fps drops. :)
8647	0	a	This is a lot like Grand Theft Auto, if you took GTA and removed a ton of the content, made it nearly impossible to make money, and made it more of a pay to win. If you want to somewhat enjoy this game, you're going to have to shell out more money than it would cost you to just buy GTAV, every single month. So, in other words, just go buy GTAV instead.
5663	0	a	it is â¥â¥â¥â¥ and wont play
6621	0	a	this game is not working for me at all
10311	1	a	Fallen Earth was OK.Not one of the best games I played,but not terrible.There are many errors to it,and in the beggining the gameplay is a little dull,but overall its a decent game mostly for fans of fallout 3.
1083	1	a	Amazing game with great development. Only issues are many hackers and a very â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ mathcmaking setup 
10367	1	a	this is a great game, if you like rpg and mmo this is for YOU! Of course they will always be the bad comments, but i recommend this game for all of u fans of rpg and mmo!
4898	0	a	Matchmaking system is terrible, keep getting repeatedly matched against fully geared players despite being brand new. Game has its charms but loses those charms quickly after the 50th rocket-induced death animation. Excited to not play this game again until they sort this crap out.
707	1	a	Welcome to the world of bumpercar, exploding vehicles, fashion shows, missions and random weirdness. Place yourself in a law-destroyed town as a police or criminal, witness or steal, arrest or escape. It's a jolly mayhem that is, ofcourse filled with smurfs so be careful. weapons are all time-limited so when purchasing remember to commit. cars are forever though. You can make personal tattoos, personal graffitti, personal car decorations and thus this game can consume your spare time to the fullest. much fun, do try it.
563	1	a	Not Bad
10056	1	a	  good game easy to level up and overall no big problems.
3874	0	a	It's just bad...
9586	0	a	What the hell is this game.
5834	0	a	Bad controlls, physics are terrible, pace is sloooowwwwww and the game is a 'PAY TO WIN' game. I knew there would be a reason why it was free so I dont know what I was thinking....
8859	1	a	Alright. This may as well be a rant but I'm going to break this review down on some subcategories. I've been playing this game for a while and recommend it to new people. HOWEVER, for people playing the Alpha and Beta like I had, GOOD LUCK GETTING YOUR CHARACTER BACK. G1 basically said 'screw you' to me and I haven't even been able to access my character from maybe...3-6 months ago? Not even? TERRIBLE.  CATEGORY 1: Graphics Now the graphics AREN'T FALLOUT LEVEL. They're about average MMORPG...Like ArcheAge or TERA. Yes, you can set your graphics really high and I get about 50-60 frames on Highest, and when I lower about 110-120 FPS. They can use some work, but I noticed if you turn your graphics down even slightly, you loose A LOT of really nice detail that they put in there for fine polishing.  CATEGORY 2: Gameplay (Combat, Movement, PvP, PvE) Gameplay is...it's...it's alright. The combat is either 1st or 3rd person; and personally I would rather go 3rd. 1st person is extremely wierd and awkward, and rather dull as well. Now, as for movement- THE MAPS...IN THIS GAME...ARE SO FREAKING HUGE. I SWEAR. TO GOD. They split them up into 'Sectors,' and the last being 'Alpha County' which is basically the end game area. Now, that being said, you can ATTEMPT to run there. However, I tried to get from Sector 1 to Sector 2, and didn't pack enough feed for my horse. I was left STRANDED IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE with a horse that eventually DIED on me (No it didn't literally, but it may as well have with the speed it was going). So, if you're going between Sectors, be sure to grab a mount. But what I would LOVE to commend G1 for doing here is I have never...NEVER...IN MY LIFE..EXPERIENCED A LOADING SCREEN TRAVELLING. Only will you ever for teleporting and loading INTO the game. Travelling is loading-screen free, along with dungeons as well.  -Mounts in the game are very nice to have and can be pricey at times, but they're well worth the buy. You have two types of mounts, machines and natural. Natural covers things like horses and some kick-â¥â¥â¥ massive wolves you can ride on. And no they aren't your stereotypical wimpy â¥â¥â¥ wolves. These things are H-U-G-E and well worth getting in the quest line that you complete to get them (yes, you can actually get mounts through questlines; GOOD ONES not just starter ones). Machines covers ATV's, Bikes, Buggies, and Cars. But, the higher tier you get on mounts, THEY ARE GOD-AWFUL TO TAKE CARE OF. Be ready to spend some in-game cash to take care of them, 'cause some use 'premium' fuel.  -PvP in the game is fairly decent, involving some ethics of 'skill' and dodging. However, if you want PvP, it is HORRIBLY balanced. Rifleman and snipers are left in the dark, along with some longer range classes while melee is the way to go. Oh, and you think carrying a massive club around is going to get you where you want? HELL NO. Yeah, you have the OCCASIONAL good heavy melee weapon that can get the job done; but no, you'll be faced with a load of VERY....VERY...VERY fast DPS melee weapons that literally shred you. So for PvP, get some very fast dual pistols or duel machetes/knives.  -PvE/Questing is nice in the game and is pretty alright. However, questing can get..repetitive. 'RUN HERE, SHOOT THIS, RUN BACK, TURN IT IN. DONE.' Now, there are the exceptional quests that do have you doing some pretty cool things such as setting explosives on a vehicle or hunting down massive bosses. And the bosses in this game are VERY...VERY hard to beat without a group. Other than that...Not really much else for questing. I commonly found myself GRINDING THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of high level enemies just to rank up. Took me HOURS and loads of cash for ammunition.   CATEGORY 3: Community The community is alright, but nothing different from any other MMO community out there. You're going to have those OBVIOUS dickwads and terrible people. Hell, you will even FIGHT...LITERALLY FIGHT over loot sometimes. Seriously...fk that. Even then, on GLOBAL channels people are being harassed. I had to step in once and tell someone to back off, which then lead to me reporting these asshats to the online GM (Game Moderator). Their accounts were issued a warning. Don't hope for the best from this community, 'cause you ain't gon'na receive â¥â¥â¥â¥.  Now....now comes the Pay-to-Play/Pay-to-Win. N-O. All things you will get to buff up your character is IN GAME. The only thing in this 'cash shop' is going to be cosmetics and SOME boosts such as EXP. Overall, a fun game, good setting, terribad community, decent cash shop. â¥â¥â¥â¥ TRAVELLING BY FOOT. IN. THE. â¥â¥â¥â¥.  EDIT: Funny Things in the game &gt;Running around in a speedo with a gasmask on. &gt;Crafting horses. With Kits. That's right. There's a kit to craft a horse. Oh and one more thing, this game, as it is made by Gamers First, MAY NOT WORK ON SOME PEOPLE'S COMPUTERS. I don't know what is wrong with it but sometimes these games just don't want to work.
5703	0	a	This game is full of hackers and if one of u hackers see this just kill urself and it is p2w â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game it â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sucks i got killed in the spawn 100000000 times by a hacker
5232	0	a	they're just milking whatever little amount of revenue they can from spanish and brazilian children with money to spend on garbage in this waste of potential turned waste of space it'll be dead within next year
3773	0	a	As a high lvl Veterean (Rank 213), who played before it became APB Reloaded. I have had good and bad expereinces that you others players should know before you decide to try this shi tt yy game. I'm a vet who plays only with a few friends and we do not belong to any of those hacking â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ d i ck clans. Will, lets get to the point. My friends and me aren't your typical COD players, We actually use common sense, strategy, map awareness, gaming headsets for max sound of invironments (footsteps, cars...), steam or skype chat for fast comm, and along with our legal macros from our gaming mouse and keyboards. Will we pretty much dominated when we can most of the time, but when we versus other high lvl players and major clans and beat them in missions. They become crybabies and accuse us of hacking. Then their also friends with the ((( GM/DEV ))) so getting your legit account banned is %100 possible. I spent over $100 on this game and now its nothing because of the currupt game system and player hating h o e s.   Pros -  -great game concept that I have ever experienced -Great costumization -great fire fights in 3rd person -great realtime strategy game to play with friends/family  Cons -  -broken spawn points -unbalanced team match up (2 above avrg. stat. gold players can be matched against 3 golds or lower rank players becoming a 2 vs 3-5) one sided missions -can't even get a match going nowadays unless you wait 5min plus  -currupt DEV / GM who plays with high lvl players, and they troll or are d i c k s to other players  -Most high lvl players rank 190 and up are hackers and if not, they hack their way up with immunity from the currupt DEV/GM to get there  -if you are a decent or good player who expresses great game abilities like shooting, knowing your surroundings, common sense, and more. You will automatically be qualified as a hacker to be banned. Evidence is (heresay most of the time with rarely the anti cheat picking you up)  -BAD GAMING Community  By now you should figure that I was banned for no reason other than jealousy so I stop playing. RIP (2011-2013)   I also went back to try it out late 2014, and became a gold at rank 17. I was already accuse of hacking by my opposition. We still lost a mission due to spawn point/ one sided missions. Then my own team mate whisper to me and was cursing at me, because we lost and he thought that I was hacking so there should be no reason for us to lose.   If you want, go for it and try this game out. I told you so...
2556	1	a	its so funnn
9845	0	a	The game isnt even the glitchyist part... The launcher was. After I signed out for my first time and tried to sign back in I was forced to uninstall the game and redownlad it. But other than that one part it was a good game.
2962	1	a	I wish it was a Mac Os game also.
10411	1	a	Fun game, good time waster for free.
5115	0	a	This game isn't dead yet?  Is it completely funded by hackers now?
10133	1	a	dont play this it sucks
152	1	a	good game- very fun game to play with friends and to meat new ones...
9211	1	a	After wandering the wasteland of Fallen Earth for more than 200 hours, thought it was time to give my opinon. There is a staggering amount of quests, mutant creatures, and crafting. Being this is such an awsome free mmo, I would rate this a 9/10. This game has been around for years now, and still has alot of people coming back for more. The graphic are smooth and realistic. A variety of sound, grapic, and other setting options. The help chat is one of the best I have ever seen! Hard not to get a help queston answered by more than one player. The ability to ride horses, atv's, and sweet cars across a very large map makes me want to get 3D headset. If there were air and water craft, I would probably never want to stop gaming!?.
2424	1	a	This is A very good Game everyone should get this
855	1	a	APB Reloaded is a open world cops and robbers set gameplay. Im going to go through pros and cons of th game Pros- Very fun gameplay  PvP is great Missions are very enjoyable with friends Noob friendly UI  Cons- Very much pay to win Scrubbies everywhere with $100 guns spraying you down   Be sure to join bronze and silver ques or you will get destroyed!!!  I would reccomend but be prepared to spend $20-$50 on guns, clothes etc...
6330	0	a	The Second Life of shooters.
9202	0	a	this game has machanics for boath first and third person playstyle's and implements them and manny other game machanics horrobly. plus you'll be lucky if the game works more than once on you computer before it bugs out never to run again
7594	0	a	boring.
7842	0	a	the game:  [cons] very rare updates, except when there is new cash shop items, which is really often. the frequency of new cashshop weapons shows the game weapon balance is .. lets say .. from non existant to â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up. repetitive, will get to know all of the game has to offer in under 1 hour.  [pros] One of the better player, clothing, vehicle costomization you can find. In game editor somewhat effecitve.  The gameplay:  [cons] pay to win, With a cashshop item, learn curve is non existant. repetitive 'missions' it pretty much boils down to a team death match in a different location on the map every time. Horrendous level design. Uber effective choke points renders knowing the map aka time spent in game, more important than your ability to land shots. voip is a must, require real life friends to play with you. no headshots, less lucky kills. less dynamics. steep and stable learning curve.   [pros] you get to drive cars. shoot guns wear fancy DIY textured clothings via in game editior 
3406	1	a	nice game you can keep playing it you don't get bored
1625	1	a	I don't think i've ever spent as much money on a game as this one.
4238	0	a	I punched the detail out of a dudes face. Also don't hope for it to clsoe when you exit the game.
6728	0	a	I took all the garbage trucks (3 other friends )and drive around the biggest streets just destroying every vehicule I would see. Destroying every minute a person would have...messing with his gaming time...you can't do that anymore as theres no more garbage trucks...
4064	0	a	This game is pay-to-win garbage. It doesn't even have a tutorial so you have to â¥â¥â¥â¥ around for an hour to find out what the hell is going on.
6537	0	a	IT IS A TERRIBLE GAME DO NOT EVER PLAY IT!
5111	0	a	I've been on and off this game for about 2 years. To me the game overall is a decent idea and the customization is the best i've seen compared to any other game. The things I didn't enjoy about this game is the matchmaking. Dispite what happened in the past with the flood of aim bots and hackers; The match making is also broken.   Why is it that a gold player can just decide to join a bronze server and womp on all the new players and get just as much money as they would in a gold server? THEY SHOULD BE AUTO KICKED, Threat levels should mean something, not just a color where they recommend you go.   fix this, or your game will crumble.
5327	0	a	'BE ALL YOU CAN'T BE' i'mm guessing thats all â appY wanted before you banned his account, don't even bother pressing the download button on this one, i played it and even with my low hours i know that in hte trailers they show you cool â¥â¥â¥â¥ but hey, you can do that|! if you feed them a thousand dollars you could've bought something better with , payday 2 (-_-) , gta v a proper online open world skirmish where guess what , DLC IS FREE and the only payable thing for is money which you could easily earn in about 30 mins. my verdict they empty your pocket then give you an â¥â¥â¥ bronzing , this is just a massive kick up the â¥â¥â¥â¥ for people trying to play a 'free to play' something this falls short of being.
3832	0	a	First encounter with people in this game...hackers...I got â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥...
8079	0	a	wish it would open
6285	0	a	Cheaters everywhere.
1003	1	a	IT â¥â¥â¥â¥ING SUCKS I â¥â¥â¥â¥ING HATE IT ITS SO â¥â¥â¥â¥ING LAGGY AND THERE ARE SO MANY HACKERS AND THEY JUST KEEP KILLING ME EVERYTIME I WALK OUT OF A SAFEHOUSE
8258	0	a	if you play have fun going to lag hell , dont recommend
8594	0	a	The Devs are bunch of trolls... I'm done with this game. Give us the new Engine as you've promised years ago!! So Not Recommending this trash game. Don't play it... Spent your valuable time to somewhere else guys. You're welcome.
5426	0	a	  Not worth it at all....  You literally cant enjoy this game without spending a ton of money
5653	0	a	Fantastic cheating simulator
617	1	a	Great if you want to get bald asap.
9405	0	a	While I love this game, I honestly can't recommend it. It's dead as hell and has had NO new content in like three years.
4740	0	a	When updating this game my disk usage is at 100%.   this program is 7GB of adds and background progams running at all times.    10/10 background apps
9087	0	a	trash game lol i made a character named 'dog tounge tribal leader' i met up with my friend 'onion bread' and we basically â¥â¥â¥â¥ed off for a couple of hours. After finding out that crafting is a day-long process in real time, (legit some stuff takes 30 minutes + to craft) yeah it sucks :( also third party acccount or sum â¥â¥â¥â¥ like that.
3759	0	a	Don't let my hours fool you, I also have several thousand on their standalone client. This game isn't worth your time unless you're already a veteran, and we veterans only play because of very flawed and irrational reasons.  Infested with cheaters of every flavor, community is a toxic cesspit with only a few good people, cash shop has stopped pretending altogether that it isn't pay to win, etc.  If I could take back all the years and thousands of dollars I've put into this game, I would do so in a heartbeat... even if that time and money wasn't returned to me.  Reloaded Games is unethical, unprofessional, and just plain greedy. They're still not worse than EA, but they definitely would give EA a run for its money.  Also, yes, this is partly a rant. However, that doesn't change the simple fact that it's truth.  So yes, go ahead and dismiss this review, and waste your time (and inevitably money) downloading this game... but don't say you weren't warned about what you would be subjected to.
4713	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥T that what it is. this game is just like warface looks awesome in trailors but when it comes to game play u need micro-transaction (visa-maestro) for almost everything u got to shop for guns/clothes BOOOM! they ask you money u want to spawn in a car BOOOM! money $$$$$$$$$$$$$$ everywhere without a good â¥â¥â¥â¥ u will get_r3kt like a NOOOB
1108	1	a	APB is a very fun to play game, you don't need to pay for anything to have loads of fun. Some features of the game include Cops and Robbers, Ram Raiding (by far the best), and freeroam. There is DLC to buy but i don't use it mainly because i don't want to buy it. This is my opinion of the game, and i hope you like it. Enjoy those RamRaids!!!
5274	0	a	this game takes your money like an insurance company claims tax.
8847	0	a	Just buy gta 5 you cheap â¥â¥â¥ son of a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
5152	0	a	If you like playing one of the best games ever and they having it lagged server wide every 15 mins until you want punch out a dev, this is the game for you. I am literally the most calm person I know, and this games lagg issues â¥â¥â¥â¥ me off so hard I raise my voice and rage quit....... I NEVER rage quit and NEVER raise my voice. This game is literally making me a worse person. Gameplay is awesome, street fights are awesome, customization is UNREAL!! This sounds great until you lose 3 or 4 matches in a row because you are lagging for 1 min and 15 seconds you needed to tag a wall. â¥â¥â¥â¥ you devs, for making such an amazing game and then making it unplayable.
439	1	a	the game is great but when i open it , it closes it self.
6990	0	a	Takes ages to set up, and once your in its very boring. even with your friends. 
2246	1	a	APB Reloaded to me is one of the best free to play games that you can play, as its not overly difficult to play unless you are really into it, new players can get a few free bonuses like a few free codes to get in game premium so they earn more money and level up quicker with the contacts, the more you play and the better you play the better your skill will get, and the better skill you get the more chance you have of rising in threat level.  There are 5 threat levels, new accounts are T Rank (Trainee) then you have Green threat, which is a player has not won a mission when they leave trainee, then you have bronze which shows that they are not that good at the game, then silver threat which means they are good, but not all the time, then there is gold threat which is someone who is dedicated to the game and never wants to lose and are the most dangerous players to be pitted against if they are max rank in the game which is 255.   It takes a long time to get there, I have spent about 600+ hours on that character and I got her to max rank and gold threat and you can also have a customized character, like my character at this moment looks like she is a paramilitary as she is wearing a big chest rig with some ammo pouches on it, a long sleeved shirt, some cargo pants with knee pads and boots. With any F2P game there are micro transactions, and I fell for it like most have and spent some money on the game, which was a mistake if I am honest as most of my items were bought for me by my clan mates.  the only downside to this game is the amount of people who dislike the game because if the developers and play this game to just purely put in the chat on how bad this game is and putting in a lot of hate comments and sometimes even racial slurs, there is also the downside of the amount of hackers that his game have, itâs rare to find one but they are easy to spot when you find them, and they do get banned after a while but they will come back, and it is also very infuriating when this happens, and another bad thing about APB is that the servers and the game engine don't really like people being on them as there is a lot o lag due to the engine and the servers are also quite bad sometimes as say they are European even though I have 110 MS and it is noticeable
1314	1	a	This is a sandbox game close to GTA. Lots of this to do. Like kill a randomer. rob a car. Jump of a building. An endless variety of things to do. So click that install button. It might take a while to load but its worth it. And for those peeps who love making characters you can make a character. Choose from criminal and enforcer. Get better weapons and clothes and Rule your World!!!!!!
2147	1	a	Great game, needs a bit of a polish the come up to the expectations of gamers but the ideas are great! The story lacks and you just need to ignore it and continue in a rampage across the city!!!
6886	0	a	Pay to win. So simple.  Was getting â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ until I picked up a free (for 30 minutes) rifle from the marketplace and suddenly it's like the good switch got turned on.  Not interested.   Would be a cool game if they just went pay to look good but it's just another cashcow. Steer clear.
6896	0	a	I will say this, I wanted to go back to this game after playing it during my highschool days and dropping it after say a few months.  The game is amazing on customization as in beautifully stunning in the fact that EVERYTHING can be changed with your character (Clothing to body) and Cars and guns (albeit with premium limitations on designing) but beyond sitting in the hub far from the sh!tstorm that is the open world of APB:R, there isn't much more to be said about it, if anything I would rather pick up the game just to twiddle with the fun customization stuff you can do than hoping and praying that I can have a fun firefight with all kinds of players that isn't laggy or one sided on who has a sniper/rocket launcher or an ARMAS bought gun.
8281	0	a	APB Reloaded a fps good for anyone that wants to play a cops vs criminals,Awesome gameplay nice graphics good music and sound its almost perfect but its the wors game I`ve ever played cause its unplayable you cant spawn in a district or play only 1 hour cause the game crashes every 1 second I dont know why cause I played it before and it was better and had no crashes now it fells like the game is a beta not a full game because of the many crashes I tried everithing turning down the graphics and resolution and didnt work so Dont waste time on this game
9006	1	a	You can collect 'Suspicious Cheese' and 'Questionable Meat'. The epic journey of surviving in a post apocalyptic wasteland by crafting horses.
8538	0	a	Terrible. Just terrible. From its suspicious anti-cheat engines running in the background to the 2005 graphics, this game makes my list for one of the most bland and boring games. Do not download it.  Pros:  -It's free.  Cons: -Horrible lowly community of people who seek therapists. -Pay to customize. -Graphics are terrible even on the highest settings. -Frames are always 15-20 fps on a desktop that has 12 gigabytes of RAM. -Feels like a GTA clone. -A world with little to do but kill others. -Strange lighting. -Very confusing to get the hang of missions and what you're even supposed to do. -Launcher always fails at least once before it is able to successfully launch. -Disorganized world. -The two factions feel very unorganized. -Causes me to vomit.
3802	0	a	What Reloaded studios PROMISED everyone on the APB:Reloaded RETAIL BOX:  - Asylum District - Racing District - Clan Wars (aka turf wars)  This was to be delivered by the end of 2012. None of it happened.  We're now by the end of 2013 in all this time and what they actually delivered was:  - Fightclub (A deathmatch mode which is basically a rehash of already existing city parts but with boundaries so that you don't actually load the entire city which causes horrible performance issues) - Lucky box 1 LIMITED TIME ONLY!!! EXCLUSIVE!! BUY NOW!!! SALE!!!! (gambling real money for p2win items) - Lucky box 2 - Lucky box 3 - Lucky box 4 - Lucky box 5 - Lucky box 6 - Lucky box 7 - Lucky box 8 - Re-hued machinegun (grey to gold) skins for 15â¬  Also, they will try to sell you the idea that this game is not P2WIN, I'd say that's arguable... Boosters vs Grindfest, Nano vs... everything else.   Update: Make that... - Lucky Box 9, 10 and 11 now.
7535	0	a	The first impression is that you're in for an amazing experience. But the more you spend playing, the more you realise how much troublesome it is to play this game. Firstly, the servers are underwhelming. Secondly, the game is absolutely pay to win. I repeat, you WILL NOT be able to achieve ANYTHING WORTHWHILE in THIS DONKEY GAME unless you're willing to spend your whole monthly savings. A no from me.
8288	0	a	3 Words can discribe this game Pay 2 Win.. No really it's a P2W game and the weapons they sell are extreamly expensive and as far as I can tell the Devs favor on the Criminal side duo to some seriouse unbalance LTL weapons that take 8 hits just to stun a person but it takes 3 hits with a normal weapon to kill you seems a little on the BS side if you tell me. I would not bother downloading the game
6238	0	a	Well,i dont recommend it for laptops because it froze when i tried to load it.
1961	1	a	I like this game alot.
9079	0	a	Horrible just flat out horrible. Tried this game when it first came out and you could only play the first few mins then you were stuck in a room going nowhere cause they wanted you to play to play. Gave it another go a week agaon and holy crap it sucks. Not sure how it got a Metacritic score of 71, but dont waste your time on this one.
3007	1	a	0/10 Cant wear a bra as a man

5921	0	a	If you dont have good mouse, mouse pad, sensitivity, good nerves , then this game is not recommended for you. This game can turn you into nervewreck.  Not recommending. -Got killed by a grenade which blew up on the other side of the wall. -Was driving at enemy, he shot with bazooka at me, I blew up, car flew and dropped on top of him, he survived. -If you sit on top of grenade when it exploads, you dont die unless you on low health. -Veterans whining about hackers in district chat when they lose, while they act ruthless against beginners/noobs. -Bad matchmaking. Beginners are putten against veterans. Matches might end up 0 kills on one side and 20 kills on other. -Rating system. You gain better weapons as you play this game and become better, giving you ever more easier way to kill beginners. -No reward if you did your best but failed. Some matches you might end up playing 5-10min and gain nothing. -Players can drive on top of other people cars. Like what the hell. -Players can jump over cars that are driving towards them. Again, what the hell. -Lack of shooting or dodging tutorials. There are moments when you waste entire clip on enemy while for him it takes only 5 bullets to kill you. Veteran basically jumps around doing zig zag dance, dodging your bullets, even if he takes hit, there is no pentalty for him. -This is too fast paced with no penalty when taking hit. -Fast regenerating health. -Pay to win. You can buy premium guns.

Walk out of the Station...see three pimped out Super cars drag racing down the street...one hits a car, flips over, and exploads... Me: I think I'm gona like this game!  Second Day... Walk out of the Station...See a pimped out van driving down the streets with 2 guys hanging out the sides unloading their weapons into whoever is chaseing them...Whos chasing them? two pimped out Super cars with sirens blaring...one hit a car, flips over and explodes... Me: Yep...I'm definitly gona like this game...
9709	0	a	spent a â¥â¥â¥â¥in hour downloading this just find myself downloading more updates. didnt even play it. because of the 10 hour updates i had yo put up with. dont waste your time here unless you love watching â¥â¥â¥â¥ 'update' for 200 days.
880	1	a	APB:Relaoded is kinda full of bugs and flaws, but its highly addictive and tons of fun. Its one of the best games i've ever played and one of the worst at the same time. I totally recommend it for everyone who like 3rd person shooters, since its for free and u cant do anything wrong on something thats for free ;)
3988	0	a	Terrible. Stay away. Not even remotely as good as it looks, not even as good as it was before it went to hell and then F2P. I played it long before it went F2P and not all the time I played the F2P version is recorded on Steam. Pay 2 Win cash shop policy and more often than not infested by hackers, and even if nobody hacked it would still be camp 2 win.
10817	1	a	As a player that has played on and off for more than 4 years, I can safely tell you that RotMG's best days are already gone. Kabam, the owner of the game, neglected the game for years. The player base was shrinking, and many duping/hacking exploits where being used everywhere. This could all make one turn away from this game. However, times are changing. A new company called Deca Games has bought RotMG and is striving to breath new life into it. They have already established a connection with the community and have worked long hours to patch the exploits that made the game unplayable for the honest man.Because of the fact that RotMG seems to be going in a very positive direction, I would highly recommend this game.
3511	1	a	I would say it is a pretty solid game, it's just that the Pay to Win is a bit too obvious but with the majority being f2p I think it is not a big problem.
1075	1	a	Like smashing your friends van to steal a boombox? GET ABP RELOADED! Like getting your van stolen by your friend? GET ABP RELOADED! Wanna die? Commit suicide, or GET ABP RELOADED! Like copyrighted cars? GET ABP RELOADED!    Best game ever 666/10
4079	0	a	This game is broken... I downloaded the game off the official website and it would not let me launch it up. So i deleted the files and downloaded it off steam and yet again would not let me play. So i tryed to delete it again and it would not let me, even now as i write this review it says im playing APB, but i'm not. I dont know if this a common problem but personaly i am pretty disapointed.

3771	0	a	Review by a Long term Veteran of this game. From RTW(Retail, which I picked up at around July 2010) to Now and later.  (Excuse typo errors and any strange sentence combinations, fast typing and letters get mixed here and there and I really don't care enough after typing all of it to fix things) Deal with the fact I put a lot of time in the game, it just means my information is more backed then others.(oh man I'm boasting about it, now I'm uncredible)  Here we go.  Freemium! This game is heavily dependant on you paying for Premium to experience anything good, not like there's much to experience good cause really the only good thing about this game is the customization, but you need to unlock symbols (random mission reward that gets fewer and fewer the more you have) and the tutorial is terrible might I add so you'll get a lot of people making the experience that much more unpleasant.  Armas is a mess of Limited Time items(as of this review), far too many that it's laughable of how much content is limited time only and just recycled to fill in voids of no new content. With the new dev people, it seems that content is more frequent at points, but how long that can last till they just sit around and bank it up with limited time offers and resells? Who can say? It's all Pay for crap anyway, including items already in the game when it sank back in Retail like, goggles, desert scarfs and some others. The Uniform Jacket(Javez wears it and he's a criminal so there's no excuse) is still ENFORCER restricted for no good reason.  Server Performance(Not Client Framerate) Holy crap, the amount of problems you'll face is ridiculous, even the newer server hardware they're using isn't good at all for this type of game, you'll experience inconsistent handling with your car (due to handling being server side. Any spike, you will feel it and see cars smash into walls, people unable to control them as they exclaim in District chat 'Jesus take the wheel'. The amount of hitreg issues you'll face(taking into account IT IS hitscan, the ol I aim at this and the shot is instant) the slightest amount of spread on your weapon can really screw you over from how wonky the game takes the your information. You'll face many inconsistencies in fire fights that accuracy is blatantly thrown out the window witbh the issues and you're better off squeezing. **You'll see people using HVR Scouts and jump shotting with it (Pin point accuracy while doing so) to avoid certain problems with how bad detection can be.** They removed jumpshotting apparently from  vanilla  scouts.  Most people you will come to find out, will use full auto weapons(OCA, ACES, PMG, NTEC/CR5, Stock STARs and whatever new dumb gun there is) just to beat the awful hitscan system by firing as much as possible and not having the issues of shot registrations and bad bloom math from the game (ghost shots and magical bullets not hitting) I'll stop it there cause it's the biggest problem in the game(cause you're gonna have to deal with it to progress) and there's far too much to talk about relating to it but you can figure it out.  Framerate It's pretty on and off cause it's a bad version nof the Unreal Engine, your frames can drop for no reason so I'd suggest a FPS config even with decent hardware cause this game spits on it while not looking at all decent. They got rid of the pristine texture quality from RTW and a lot of the bloom to amke the game look more lively, to help 'performance'(I'm just gonna assume server load cause it hasn't done â¥â¥â¥â¥) AND lessen game size (which who the hell cares about 4-8 extra GBs anymore? There's games that are larger then this game and have less content in the grander scheme. More excuses.)  Gun Balance Gun Superiority here is a big thing, expect to see the same weapons over and over dominating. Full autos and high damage weapons rule over others and that's that, there's nothing interesting to the weapons at all, they all feel terrible(bad sounds, generic recoil) and with the server performance it's just not fun playing at all when you feel like you're hitting people with marshmallows, and you're gonna have to do a lot of things in action districts just to enjoy the best side to it which is..  ~Customization~ It's great but not without it's own issues. Certain features aren't there like snaping angles and what not so you're gonna be moving your mouse slightly back and forth to get that perfect position as well as ugly jagged outlines and darkened ones making masking over things difficult if you aren't using black to mask over brighter colors on a black background. (Makes sense when you start doing it, don't worry about how I tried to word it, you'll find out if you get into it) Texture projection is really bad, certain items can just cut off something on your shirt when overlaying it, causing ugly outlines. (Wearing a blazer/bomber jacket over a designed shirt) You HAVE to have Premium to enjoy customization cause there is a lot of restrictions if you want to make your own things. Use to be 5 layers free on clothing, and in CB they changed it to 3. â¥â¥â¥â¥ knows why. Tattoos are buggy, very...very... buggy. Some randomly duplicating, disappearing or just not layering properly. It's a nightmare once you're over 30 tattoos out of 50. You'll remove a tattoo, but it'll really remove something COMPLETELY different when you leave the kiosk, then you'll have to re-add it and it's just a never-ending nightmare, you'll have to do a lot of your tattoo designs in one go to avoid most issues if you start removing tattoos. You're gonna have to do missions to unlock most of the basic clothing you might like, and symbols (if you aren't buying them off armas.)  Armas Some weird â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up child of limited offers and high pricing. DO NOT buy weapons from Armas. NEVER do it, you can perform just as well with a stock weapon if you care enough to brave this game, and just to hopefulyl make them learn that pricing weapons that high(40-60 dollars sometimes) is stupid. Just stick to Premium, Clothes(they like doing stupid bundle â¥â¥â¥â¥, be wary that jacks the price up), and Cars if you are going to put money into this dying game  That's all I really wanna put down, I got a lot to put off my chest about this disappointing game that I thought was gonna be great back in 2010. Summary This game is terrible for a shooter, don't take it serious. Get points and if you lose, so what? You got standing and cash anyway, this isn't a game that has any rewarding skillful gameplay, you get your rewards and you progress to get what you want. Grindfest it up!  They tried to eliminate Idling the missions as much as possible, you'll have to do some work to get rewards, which means if you just get unlucky, and don't perform well, you might not even get anything cause that's how bad the system is.   The Community is a bunch of autism filled 4*channer kids who are all about the memes, that's all I really should put for those guys.  Have fun?... Or don't. I'll be in Social District for most of my APB time if I ever launch the game again.  I'd like to touch,  this is not a competitive shooter game . There are dumbasses actually doing clan scrims in a poorly done game. Team Fortress 2 deserves more of a competitive scene then this game.  TL;DR: Game isn't good and probably won't be further on. There's no direction in where it's going. Gun Play, grinding progression is not fun, and in which it's basically pushing you to buy Premium to even go at a decent pace, which late tier contracts are just insanely inflated and slow.  Example on Customization from a stream of me making someone an outfit -   Twitch is dumb and removes stuff that's months old.
6301	0	a	i only played it because my friend hacks in it, still pretty bad tho
92	1	a	Do you want to play a game where you can steal cars...drive them and destroy them because you always wanted to do it? Or do you want to shoot the sh*t out of your enemy and enjoy the physics of the dead body flying from that building you shot him before? Or do you just want to play GTA online? This â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ awesome game does include every aspect mentioned! Play as a crime or an enforcer, it is your choice.

7277	0	a	A fairly interesting experiment in human psychology reminiscent of pavlov's dog. An element of chaos was added to test whether or not humans prone addictive stimulus; were capable of forming long term habitual indulgence if they were not guaranteed a reward. This, of course, plays off the humanity's love of 'gambling'. Indeed, other forms of pure gambling are present as well to to give more conclusive results. In addition, Gamersfirst has chosen over the years to stimulate enviromental changes in the form of 'weapon balance' to see if the addictive qualities of the 'game' will hold up under stress.  With no set end date, and the experiment soon to branch out further in scope. I eagerly look forward to the results of Gamerfirst findings. With rigorous testing protocols and such a large sample size. This is surely the most in depth study of the human psyche regarding habitual gambling.  Or hey maybe it's just a poorly managed game by a company looking to make a quick buck while taking four years to develop anything of substance. This game honestly doesn't deserve this kind of abuse, hopefully it'll be put out of it's misery soon.
4428	0	a	What is this? It's a sort of 'Cops and Robbers', where one team has to do an objective, the other has to prevent them (or they both compete to have control over the same objective).  On paper this seems great! You get to fully customize your character, your vehicle, even a special theme for when you are MvP or kill another player! A variety of weapons, equipment, and the open world style of the game allow for a lot of neat missions!  So why is this bad? Well for one, there seems to be little to no moderation involved. I've lost count how many times I saw somebody snap to everybody in sight, or shot through a wall, etc.  Another huge issue is the concept of 'Pay 2 win'. There are a lot of neat weapons, but the best ones are for sale with REAL MONEY. I could understand for reskins, but these are literally straight upgrades to normal in game weapons.  And in terms of the customizations? A lot of players tend to just make half-naked characters (no styling, just underwear), same copy-paste vans, and usually some kind of theme made to make your ears bleed, making it painful at best to play against other characters.  Loading is also a horror... If you go too fast (which, given the nature of CARS) you can actually out run render distance, and in turn you will be driving and suddenly cars and even possibly buildings can just appear out of thin-air.  Even looking past these, in terms of gameplay it's missions are fundamentally flawed. Forget that you did the first 4 parts of a mission flawlessly, they managed to win by just running away for 5 minutes straight after the fact. Instead of it being 'A does B, and C must stop them', it does that until the final stage, in which it generally seems to become whoever is best at running or knows the most ridiculous spots to put objects. This gives a team that should have lost a free win more often than not.   Overall, a great concept but a terrible game.

5578	0	a	I did write a very bad review on this game. THIS IS WHAT I WROTE. I have over 3000 hrs in this game, threat gold. If you like playing a game with 12 year olds ramming you with their car, trolling, no good teamwork then this game is for you. If you like playing on a outdated laggy engine this game is for you. If you like playing with crap guns that are totally unrealistic then play this game. People will say this game has skill, but what is the skill is the question?. Their isnt any. If you know how to tap fire, duck, move left to right, camp, spray, sneak up and steal your teammate's kill then you will be pro. In mission districts all the gold threat players play in the silver district. The gold district is 0 in population. You have players that will dethreat to silver to just go to the bronze district to troll with osmaws. The game is very unpopulated also.    Gamersfirst support sucks. I got scammed awhile back I was trying to trade a N-HVR Reaper for another lengend, I contacted gamersfirst support, and reported the incident and they took care of that and I got my gun back. Got scammed again and contacted support. I was trading a condor for another legend. And I showed them proof of that incident. And they told me that they would be glad to help me. They banned the person yeah. But I did not get back my gun. They told me that they were sorry that the restoration of my item wasn't available at the moment. So I messaged them back and told them about how I got my lengendary back before when I was scammed. They replied saying they only do it one time. If they only do it just one time. They should just ban ingame trading or make a trade system. Because people spend alot of money on joker boxes for legendarys, and you have people that has spent alot of time getting legendarys.      The good things about this game are. 1. Great Charactercustomization 2. Only game I know with a music studio 3. Good symbol designer, if you have premium 4. Car constumization, but very few cars. 5. Good clothing designer if you have premium. If you don't have premium you are limted on what you can do.  BUT STARTED THINKING ABOUT IT. This game is not that bad its just Gamersfirst that makes it bad. It's an actual really good game. Just owned by the wrong people. It's very unique game. No game is like it. I'm not going to say don't play. Play it because if this game gets more populated it may get better one day. I feel like if it died. It would stay dead forever. I don't want that to happen. I know the weapons aren't very realistic but that may change one day. Who knows. Maybe if the engine update really happens; maybe it will fix alot of things and make it better. I can only hope so. BUT PLAY IT. IGNORE ALL THE BAD REVIEWS. ITS NOT THAT BAD. THIS GAME WILL JUST MAKE YOU SAY BAD THINGS ABOUT IT. AND YOU WILL COME BACK PLAYING IT. AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I MEAN YOU WILL.   Thinking about it again though â¥â¥â¥â¥ This game!!! Old piece of crap that they aren't ever going to fix and update. It's a joke on Xbox after watching gameplay videos of it it lags worse than it does on PC.
6278	0	a	Quite literally the worst game ive played. The best part was when i uninstalled it. If you want pay2win simulator here you go. If you dont, then dont touch this thing they call a game.
5791	0	a	Just a wannabe gta:SA
645	1	a	My first impression of APB Reloaded is possitive. I think, when playing together with friends, it will give you a nice co-op experience where tactical team-work can be a vital advantage.  Though personally, I find it not so straight forward on how everything works. Like choosing different weapons, how the missions and objectives work, etc. But it gets clearer ones playing I suppose.
168	1	a	This Game Is fun when you are playing with friends,Hackers get banned almost instantly i would say 8/10 
7005	0	a	amazing character creation but the game is ughghgh
6747	0	a	haha...yes there are screenshots and videos, when it comes to the game, lets take a seat and discuss things...  first, you download the game from steam.  second you have to install the company's gaming site (their version of steam).  third you must download the game from their site.  fourth you must install another version of Gamers Live   fifth you realize you spent three days downloading two versions of a game that when started runs error codes which have no repairs except reinstall the game  sixth you spend a couple of hours searching through the programs to uninstall it after you uninstalled it  seventh you find that to this day it continues to run in your background ._.
9545	0	a	DO NOT.... DOWNLOAD... THIS GAME!!!!!  It is quite a buggy, fustrating mess of a game that is trying to be fallout but with mmo but fails because while fallout was more an experience with a narrative, fallen earth is just quests with little unique background interaction, i ran around the world for 2 hours and the only out of quest experience i had was finding a glitch that made me go though a tree and end up on top of it. if it wasnt abit too big to play for the lols i would say, play it for the lols but dont even try.

8117	0	a	As someone who has played APB a long time back when it wasnt on steam aswell, I have to say this, The game is good yes but what ruined this game atleast for me and proably for many others.. Is the fact that the community is the way it is... They are salty.. Mad at that theres cheater and that it's basicly P2W Most of the players you will meet are only in there to show others how horrible this game has become by being rude and sorry my language being â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s aswell   Now if you can somehow avoid the community I can tell you will have your fun in this with friends and such   I am honestly suprised it is still alive seeing how GTA online is now on pc and has much more stuff to do :p well on that note   My regards.
4558	0	a	Hmmm What can i say about APB Reloaded... Well The game is great if there wasent so much hacking lag and general No â¥â¥â¥â¥ Given when it comes to the developers.... They just dont care about the people or game... This game is only for and ever will be for people who pay to win .... Hackers who ptw will Never get banned becuase unless uve payed more then him or have more people who ptw report him nothing will get done.. Free to play people have no pull in the game...Its terrible some of the ptw weapons being super op.. Its just an unfit game for anyone who doesnt want to spent 50+ dollars to win and troll people  2/10 f%*king Disgracefull  Gamers first my â¥â¥â¥ more like Bank account First   UPDATE: 4/10/14  Well im done with this game 150+ hours and im a decent player but its just too terrible, Ive incounterd so many hackers and Such op weapons this game isnt fun anymore Those of you who ever play F.ree T.o P.lay games Please check if its by Gamers First.  Games go to Gamers First to die slowly  Just dont play any games by these people do yourself a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Favor and Dont get frustrated
1526	1	a	i love this game.It has it's flaws though.
6353	0	a	i dont even get why this was made
7002	0	a	Ok... APB Reloaded is a peculiar game. It's fun and completely awful all at the same time. The most controversial aspect of this game is it's usage of the Free-to-play model, a significant change from it's original incarnation as a subscription based game. However, this model always begs the question: Do you actually have to pay money to play this game against other paying players? In this case, the answer is unfortunately a resounding 'Yes!!!' Using in-game money received from beating missions (which I have significant issues, as you'll read momentarily) only unlocks weapons for 10 days. Additionally, not all weapon types are available for purchase using the in-game money. Some of the most powerful weapons in the game (the OCA 'Whisper,' for example) are only available for purchase using G1 credits -- otherwise known as real money. This type of F2P model is horribly unattractive to me. If you offer a game for free, don't restrict the fun to the people that play.

5339	0	a	A game acting like its GTA 5, don't get it.

6843	0	a	If you trade legendary items you get banned for scamming. So either buy it with ingame money or don't trade weapons at all.
3878	0	a	APB Reloaded is fun for the first few days. After a while it gets repetitive with only 3 maps or called ' Districts ' in the game, Financial, Waterfront and Social. The driving mechanics is rather delayed and takes time to get use to. Customization is very diverse where you can make your own symbols that you can either put on your body as a tattoo, cars, and clothing. Gameplay is unbalanced and seems Pay2win. AI citizens are repasted around the districts and are dumb at sometimes. The two factions are the Enforcers and the Criminals, each faction have their own cars and contacts. Contacts don't have much peronality as they're just mindless AI characters with repetitive dialouge. Gun markets seem cheap, you can only buy them for a limited time for ingame currency. I give this game a 6/10.
4776	0	a	bad game and even worse anti cheat
4735	0	a	I wish I had read the reviews before I actually went into the game a few years back. For the most part, you need a high end desktop to run this. I had found the concept interesting, but now it just runs rampant. The customization is really nice. However, this is NOT new user friendly (I'm an average player). I had no clue what I was doing. Everything seem expensive and confusing.
3077	1	a	i love this game
3870	0	a	Well, where to start...  1. The game offers the possibility to adopt different gameplay styles, according to scenery. 2. Besides having, and of course, claiming to have a 'good system' to prevent cheating, there hasn't been a day that goes by that one does not come across, either by using macro's or simply Aimbot. 3. The cheating 'community' for this game is also constantly developing to overcome the system in play (check U n k n o w n C h e a t s ). 4. Crying, crying, sobbing and sugar... A typical found combination during gameplay, due to the dominant age of the players involved (mainly from 13 to 17), resulting in ghosting missions, chat rage, abusive use of /report commands, and so on. 5. Random stutters (from 1 to 2 secs of freeze) during missions, occurring in a spontaneous fashion. 6. LAG. Yeah... since 2012 I must recognize that it has gotten worse.  7. Just to end on some 'good terms': create or join a clan or simply play with a friend. This game becomes more appealing that way and creates a better experience.   Overall Rate: 5/10
8085	0	a	Literally the worst 'game' on steam. -58790823450924385743705/10 rating.

703	1	a	I started it up and tried to play it. Then I spilt coffee on my keyboard and it became unplayable. 2/29%
6106	0	a	Don't bother  Logged on yesterday, joined a team and went on a mission. Got shot by own team, they said 'pay to win' to me, then i quit. Don't bother if you arent going to spend, or your own team members will shoot you for no reason. 
1976	1	a	ruined my life :D liek if yuo kry evrey tiem!
5305	0	a	this game is for â¥â¥â¥â¥boys
2415	1	a	I ran someone over and they flew up into the air. 20/10
9053	1	a	Very entertaining, good amount of quests, easy to log in, play and log out for quick runs.
9234	1	a	very much like Fallout and STALKER. This game is very interesting with its PvP and mechanics which i enjoy very much and the transportations like horse's, and vehicles are a good feature. The community of Fallen Earth is the best part, everyone doesnt try to kill you they're pretty much friendly unless you kill someone then theyre gunna all go in a all out war with you. If you play PvP and kill someone with a different faction there WILL be consequences like for example, getting more noticed which is a problem since that will lead to death for you. I reccomend this game if you love Fallout and/or STALKER.
9912	1	a	Well after a bit of time spent to this game you can say it's cool and not.   This game has a lot of pottential, It has a verry well made story line with a lot of world events arround that will allow you to grather, level and have fun as a lone wolf or with your friends.   The Engine the game has it's old as â¥â¥â¥â¥ and it's all glitchy and laggy due the G1 not supporting FE development enough but still i think you should give it a try when you have time, It's all about getting out of sector one wich is the worst place of them all, after that the S2 PvP S3/Deadfall/The District and /PvP is quite funny and entertaining. Level 55 PvP is not the best but not the worst either, to much drama honnestly.   The best thing about it as a F2P is that it's truly F2P. You can do a quick 5 min survery and buy the cheapest item from the marketplace with like 5 G1C and unlock the 10 Red Chips money cap wich is the only thing that hold you back a little. I've so far invested about 5 minnutes into the marketplace and 0.00$ into the game since it went F2P.    Crafters might want to buy commander though, It'll speed up the crafting stuff quite a lot and It allows you to have a larger crafting que.
7326	0	a	its bad
5303	0	a	this game used to be fun but now its a game of lag and itiots
7544	0	a	need alot of revison and alot of balnce 
1286	1	a	is good i met 2pac he wasnt very nice tho
6385	0	a	I played this game a while back, I wasn't very impressed. You have to pay to get almost anything, whether it be a gun, clothes, or cars. The game was filled with hackers. The only pros were the amazing customization, and the large open world.
4526	0	a	Worst 'free to play' game ever. Dont you even try playing this piece of poop. It will suck all your money.
2703	1	a	While playing APB when I did, which was at least a year ago, maybe more, I had fun doing so. In my mind, when I was playing APB Reloaded, I thought of the game as gta online (when it didn't exsist) and I had fun playing it. Though I was mainly robbing places from a day-to-day basis in this game and running from cops. I had fun doing so. I never spent actual money in this game, as I don't for most other free-to-play games. This is a Third Person Shooter/MMO. You can either choose to be a Good guy (Cop) or just a regular criminal. I only played as a criminal but I have heard being a cop can also be fun. And of course this game is a lot more fun to play with friends, but you can always make friends in the game too, I did a little of both while playing this. At the end I grew out of APB, it wasn't a bad game, just moved onto other games mainly because I wanted a feel at other stuff. But when I did play I went on at least three times a week, and eventually got the fast car I wanted to get. Though I wish I could've obtained the Tommy gun, I could not mainly because I didn't really want to spend real money in the game. I would suggest this game for people who are into third person games, gta, or mmos. If you're into buying stuff in the game, and designing your character when you start off this could be for you, though (at least when I played this a year or so ago) didn't have the best character creation. You'd go to a seprate server to purchase clothes, cars, and etc. And you couldn't get the really cool stuff unless you use some of your real money. With or without the real money it is still fun, so play how you want to play. This game is worth checking out, but that's my personal opinion. From my experience of playing this, as long as I did, I would rate this a 7/10 It lacks some things, but there's good things in the game too, hope you liked my review!
10734	0	a	Maybe playing it for half and hour, then it gets pretty repetitive and boring. :/ If you die you lose all your progress, I don't understand how it can have such a high metascore
3871	0	a	Like what Grand Theft Auto is, but boring. It does allow you to make your own music, so you'll have a thousand internet dorks having the game play Still Alive in your ears when they kill you.
295	1	a	OMG BEST GTA CLONE EVER GUYS (and girls) PLAY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'!!Â£!Â£!$'$%
311	1	a	IT is a cool game   
5843	0	a	This game is full of hackers and if one of u hackers see this just kill urself and it is p2w â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game it â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sucks i got killed in the spawn 100000000 times by a hacker
2894	1	a	awesome third person shooter epic
9187	1	a	best game evea but kinda like a double of fallout  
433	1	a	I found out about this game through my 'random links' method on Youtube (I click mindlessly untill something of interest pops up). It was a video made by a guy called Rapid99 titled 'A Day of Impromptu Traffic Collisions'         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  APB: Reloaded - A Day of Impromptu Traffic Collisions&nbsp;
4532	0	a	The character customization was absolutely beyond anything I have ever seen in a game and the graphics are decent. Yes. that's pretty much the only good I see in this game. I can trick out my character and car for hours on end, making it stand out from the rest; but what good is that if the game is unplayable 80% of the time? You're probably asking yourself, 'What does that mean?' Well this         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  APB Reloaded in a nutshell&nbsp;
3247	1	a	...
10679	1	a	Very nice community. Perfect with friends. Lots of replay value. So much to explore. Overall, pretty fun!
5536	0	a	This Pay 2 Win Game gets boring quickly because of shooting people over and over again they could host more events but they're too lazy to do that because they're 'making' weapons and making huge prices for them if you think this game is Free 2 Play then you are WRONG this game will not let you progress through it without BUYING it
3737	1	a	its a fun game you should play with friends. The driving is bad but its pretty fun
2729	1	a	for those who are fans of playing TPS-type games, or you're just looking for something new....this game right here? totally worth it.
8922	0	a	game was awesome but the fact is, that today the game is dead and the fact that someone hacked into my clan, disbanded it and took all my stuff that was into the clan vault, i would get them off and put on my vault but my vaults were full, don't play this game because you'll find nothing but idiots and sometimes trolls, and if you go to PVP, you must be one of the 'terror raiders' otherwise you'll be overwhelmed, because almost every pvper in the game is in that damn clan today
6188	0	a	WORST PAY TO WIN CRAP I HAVE EVER PLAYED
6433	0	a	Bugs and crashes is what makes it the worst.
5122	0	a	2/10, this game is one of the most pay2win games out there I have seen so far, incredibly unbalanced and not amusing at all, not worth the time spent. However customising the clothes is fun, too bad they are extremely hard to obtain too.
4080	0	a	Bad Community, Poor mechanics. COOL idea!  But I dont get it. The PEOPLE in the game are what are the worst. I'd rather deal with the crap from the DayZ player base....
7402	0	a	Down side is, that I can'tlogin becuase of some glitch.
10650	1	a	Ive played this game for years on kongregate, and when I saw it on steam, I downloaded it immediatly. This is a great RPG game that makes you collect, and better yourself with quests and loot. However, this is a game where you may need friends to make it an enjoyable experience. You can lock onto your friends and teleport to them so you never lose them. I strongly suggest getting this game, if you have a friend or two to play it with.
3049	1	a	I LOVE IT, is like A..... GTA game unless is just MP and is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ loads with friends :D
7506	0	a	Terrible performance on AMD graphic cards. Lots of memory crashs and couldn't find any help in the forum for my problems. Game looks on max settings almost like on minimum due to a lack of optimization. If it runs well on your system good for you but if not invest a lot of time in trouble shooting...
6688	0	a	i made an account, went to validate my account , it said 'page not found ' i repeated it couple of times... didn't work, i went for help to the website but to get help i need to be logged in... 10/10 amazing gameplay (sarcasm)
4768	0	a	Fun with other free or minimum players. but when a premium comes, everything turns to dust.
9212	0	a	Very idiot Logic,some enemy can hit you with 10 m with an axe,or when you pass them with a motorbike,ythey will hit you with a small knife from 50m...very buggy,and the premium boxes worth nothing
9156	0	a	Has allot of potential. Devs don't give enough attention to it though in the areas that it needs large amounts of improvement. My main complaint isn't the fighting physics (while they aren't very good, being that you select a monster/person and just let your character hit them over and over again on their own, think world of warcraft in a free2play game) but instead the hook to come back and play more. I just simply couldn't get immersed in the gameplay, it lacked a good storyline, and instead gave out shi tty quests as a way to waste your time. Upgrades are disgustingly expensive, leveling up takes forever, and pvp isn't even under discussion. Plain and simple, imho, its a bad game. But hey, it's free, don't listen to some dipsh its comment you read on steam reviews. Download it and try it yourself, it only took like 2-3 hours.
3536	1	a	the game is okay i wish there was no hackers p2w players are not the problem now its hackers i still play it. fun with friends, nice cars, cool events, hackers thumbs down, if you can handle hackers i recommend.
2155	1	a	This is a good game. It can get boring from time to time, however it is similar to Grand Theft Auto maybe a little more bland however it is a good game I would recommend to people 8/10
8838	0	a	I dont know how much time I put into this game some reason it isnt even in my steam library anymore. I had fun while I played the game but it got repetitive very quickly. There werent a lot of people playing it a few years ago I imagine the amount is a lot less now.
3591	1	a	if this p2w crap â¥â¥â¥ game isn't enough, how about you join a real gang you â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
9749	0	a	my verivacation didnt work!
5445	0	a	After my limited time playing this game, I could give you a pretty decent and detailed review. This game doesn't deserve one. Simply: Don't play this game. The devs are greedy, the players are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s, the gameplay is terribly boring, the game is just a downright frustrating grind and nothing else, all in all, only good thing about this game? You get to design things. Oh, did I tell you that you have to unlock the decals to design with? Or you could.. *Cough* pay real money for them *Cough*  Keep away from this one, it's a waste of time.
622	1	a	best gta clone ever.
1934	1	a	The game is pretty good but theres some things that affects the gameplay -the pshyhics are insane -car steering is hard -if you want new weapons you need to buy them with real money -there are so much hackers -this is not for everyone but my game crashes my pc after i play 10 minutes 
8290	0	a	This game and the community itself has become cancer. Stay away from it
3338	1	a	This game is fantastic. However it is hard for new players to get into it because of the amout of pay to win players. That does not mean quit. Just stay in a green or bronze District and get better. Pay to win players can be beat. You just have to have a large arrangement of weapons because pay to win probably only have a few guns that they use so if you find one that overpowers it then you can beat them easy. Every pay to win gun has a normal gun that can dominate it. Other than that slight problem the game is basically GTA just alot better and free.
10098	1	a	Really good game its just like fallout only set online
10160	0	a	Not my cup of tea.
4442	0	a	I absolutely do not recomend this game to ANYONE. This idea that criminals are taking over the city with the police in dissaray, but a new act is passed which allows a militia police force of sorts can fight the criminals is exciting. I picked this game up on the idea of 'Oh why not, it is free' only to be greeted by a game that took an eternity to download. I had to download this download that, do this third party application, taking me an hour to finish! Could you do it through steam instead!? I then said 'After all of this the game better not suck' and oh boy.... I will start with the positives. A HUGE customization system that i have never seen before, being able to modify character height, muscularity, you name it, it is there. It doesnt end there because you can customize your clothing as well with decals (I made the LVMPD uniform dont judge) You can customize your car and it is the most fun i have had in this game. Now the negatives.....where to start. When i first did a mission, I was happy as the game was kind enough to put me with decent people. After that, I was thrown into games with people who had better gear than i did, had more skill than me, and used every dirty trick in the book against me, a guy who just started the game! The matchmaking is awful! You will be cursing and raging at how much you die because the game puts you with better equiped and skilled people. On to the combat system. It is awful, just awful. Please tell me how a guy with an smg can get the same accuracy on the move as a guy aiming with an assault rifle? You will constantly be saying, 'How did he not die?!' or 'How the hell did I die!?' There is no headshots in the game because you know, shooting someone in the foot is the same as shooting them in the head right? There are no balanced hitboxes. you can make your character as small as you wish but you will have the same hitboxes as a tall person. WTF!? Veteran players abuse this 'ghost shotting' and you will be left scratching your head how you died. Also, the missions are extremely limited to a few modes. King of the hill, conquest, team king of the hill, car capture the flag (hotwire), and capture the flag. The mission descriptions themselves are also rediculous and are real â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ reasons to send the SWAT team, FBI tactical teams, ATF tactical teams for a pile of pirated video games?! Does it seriously take an entire Special Weapons and Tactics Team to raid a place for a couple boxes of pirated video games? Apparently it does because the criminals decide to defend a couple hundred dollars of damn pirated games. What i'm trying to say is that some situations you are put into, make no logical sense at all. Since this game is F2P, there are microtransactions, you should expect that. But here is the problem, instead of fixing a broken combat system and a multitude of latency problems and crap driving, they are adding new unbalanced guns to the F2P gun store. Another thing i will add, the community here is almost entirely unfriendly to ANYONE. In missions, instead of coordinating with team mates, they stay quiet just going in random directions and getting shot. At the end, they blame their team for being crap when they didnt do anything to coordinate. I was teamkilled by OTHER POLICE FORCES in a mission repeatedly. They will then go to insult you in the chat as well because you trying to coordinate in the game is a crime to these guys. These â¥â¥â¥â¥ers think that this is a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Esports tournament and if they lose 1 match, they lose a chance at a million dollars. Playing solo like I did is TERRIBLE, dont do it because you cant rely on your team for anything, bring 3-4 friends with you. I could forgive a crappy combat system if the community is somewhat bearable but here, nearly everyone is an â¥â¥â¥ or a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, there are only a few decent players and the game is fun when you get into games with them. However, getting into these games is super rare. I had a round with a really good guy that was one of the quiet ones but then opened up a little bit as me and him did missions a bit more. We were in a 2v2 and all parties were trying and it got so close, we almost won, and that was fun! What else? Oh there is a whole lot of hackers and they either aimbot or are the one shot kill types with AK 47s. To sum this all up, the community is crap, the combat system is broken, there are tons of bugs and glitches, the devs dont listen to other players on the forums and defend hackers, they dont fix the game, and it all boils down to it being a rage inducing Free to play MMO. Don't even waste your time.    Update at 2/21/2015: tried to play this game again after an update. Had a couple of good games, because i was lucky. Community is still a steaming pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥. Teamkilled by police forces.....again....called a 'dumbass' for not remembering every damn corner of the map. I hope this same community doesnt infest the other police sims out there. seriously most of the community sucks. I cannot seem to have fun in this game whatsoever but by pure chance. Im going to enjoy uninstalling this POS from my hard drive.
1569	1	a	The game is fairly decent, but I think more can be done to make this game perfect. One of things I believe this game needs is some sort of Campaign or PvE mode. Why you may ask? Well, due to the fact that not everyone is professional at PvP battles. Something like that would defintiely make this FTP game a whole lot more fun. That, and it would probably bring in a lot more players into the game as well.  And with that being said, it's a decent game. Just not perfect...
7865	0	a	Fun game but pay 2 win and hacks are everywhere
5746	0	a	This game is just a Carbon-Copy of Crackdown for Xbox 360. Don't waste your time because it is mostly pay to win and you could use your hard-drive space for another bad f2p game.

5861	0	a	NON STOP RUNNING AND THE GAME WONT START
7214	0	a	God Awful. I have been playing this game for like a month or 2 and it f***ing sucks. Sure you can customize weapons and cars n' stuff but the online gameplay just sucks. I ready in and wait 30 minutes for a mission and my other teammates wont even do the mission, they kill me when I try doing something(friendly fire X_X) and tell me they're 'priming'(from what i heard is not doing â¥â¥â¥â¥ untill a police force comes to the scene) and yelled at me for being a noob. I as a rookie game developer tell the developers 'you're doing great with customization, but PLEASE set up a better matchmaking system'. for the players i say 'Just play GTA Online, this â¥â¥â¥â¥ just sucks'. oh and one more thing developers 'WHY THE HELL CAN I ONLY RENT GUNS'. thank you
1483	1	a	If you like GTA, you'll love this game! Lots of fun, and it's free! Just don't get too upset about those who pay to win.
10348	1	a	Great game one of the best! If you enjoy Fallout you will love this game!
9356	1	a	Amazing ! I just got 3500 RP code for totally FREE ! Come and download code too    &gt;&gt;  {LINK REMOVED}  http://RiotPoint.eu/  &lt;&lt;

4811	0	a	THis game be good but I is laggin. Make a australian server. Also there be too much hackers and aimbotters. Find a way to ban them nasty â¥â¥â¥ mofos!
7775	0	a	APB is a great Free to Play game, the main problem is Free to play in this case, is free aslong as you don't mind being dominated constantly by Gold Ranked pay to win players, over half the content is inaccesible to players who wish to have a free game. This also means you and your group of 5 people can be dominated by about 2-3 pay to win players, with the best Kevlar addons and high rate of fire, aimbot like guns. This may sound like rage which a large amount of it is. However it is also the truth, if you wish to freeroam without missions with friends its a great game, but as soon as those Pay to win players arrive, just search for a new server, or leave the game. NOT WORTH THE STRESS!
1278	1	a	Even tho on steam it says i have a little over 100 hours, i have around 700 hours total downloaded through GamersFirst. I love this game for its uniqueness but it isnt for everyone. If you enjoy getting matched with opponents that are either way better than you or way worse than you then you will like it. I recommend it because its worth a try and its free to play so why not? Just give it a chance!
8417	0	a	I spent some hefty time with this game, even before it was on steam. It was bad before, and now, worse. I just installed it again today and tried 3 matches. All 3, all Premium vs Non-premium. The animations are still choppy, awkward, with no improvement. Graphic overall, still unpolished as it was 2 years old. The only reason I can possibly think of for one to spend time in this game is for its customization system, but that thing is soo restricted for non-premium (like ridiculously resticted). This is a perfect example of a failed Free to Play model. Don't play this unless you're willing to invest alot of real money, otherwise, you will not have a good time against premium players with all their boons.
5149	0	a	So much hackers and pay-to-win players you end up not knowing which is which
10863	1	a	Used to play it online. Didn't know it was on steam. Haven't played it for too long. Still love it.

4587	0	a	Personal Rating: 3/10  What's there to say about this game? It's not fun. To be honest I don't know how I sunk over an hour of my life into this catastrophe of a game. In essence, it's a GTA clone. When entering the game it turns into a Saints Row clone. Two remarkable games, should be easy to copy, right? Wrong. The controls, awful and clunky, especially in vehicles. What's the point of the game you ask? â¥â¥â¥â¥ if I know, there isn't one by the looks of things. You get plonked into a game and told to do, something...  It isn't established. There isn't a plot point, your character has no name, no tutorial, no nothing. If this game weren't free then I'd steer clear of it. But even then, it's free, so don't download it. Save yourself the time and go play some of the variables. Maybe buy a GameCube and play True Crime?
3259	1	a	awesome game, hope it would repopulate because of the long matchmaking queues
10268	1	a	GREAT!! IT AWSOME
5473	0	a	Unbalanced pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥.  Until they actually decide to use the rank system to make the game FAIR, don't bother playing it.

3955	0	a	a waste of time.
10193	1	a	If you are a fallout 3 or fallout new vegas fan then this is your game. If you played the ps3 version or any of the early releases of it you know what to expect.   It's a great game with great idea's a cool leveling system and a wide open world.  The community is generally pretty helpful and the beggining few levels give a lot to the new players to get going,  It's got a decent learing curve for leveling since it's not your typical level system, but overall i think it's good.  Aside from all that, it's glitchy as heck. first person view is good but glitchy and i mean glitchy! Combat lags, and glitches, and the overall world is glitchy meaning you will get stuck at somepoint. But the developers must have known this and gave you a skill to kill yourself to respawn at a nearby lifepod.  overall i would say this game is worth a go, and if you sub it's definitly better. but you can do alright without paying.  I would say overall i it get's a 6/10. needs work but worth a try.
6155	0	a	this is amazing if you love third person shooter but this game really suck at graphics and gameplay isnt too bad ,car driving mechanics is tottaly â¥â¥â¥â¥ , lots of hackers , matchmaking is complete â¥â¥â¥â¥ ur new? no ur pro so youll play with pro and get your nice butt kicked , making ur charr and symbols editing is not bad, but really this game worth a shot atleast , also you really need a friend to have , and this game is buggy as swamp full bugs ,lag, error codes also can anyone tell me how 2 fix error code 8? , and finally if youre really into mmofps i suggest you try this lack-of-stuff game maybe youll like it
8203	0	a	Used to be a good game since I had nothing else to do. Now that I have Csgo, this is utter BS. Dont play this. It is basically a game where people who pay for their guns will always win. Spend a little money and actually get a good game you will like rather than play these free games.
9577	0	a	Fallout is awesome! Oh, wait this isn't Fallout? Oh yeah it's 'Fallen Earth' don't buy that â¥â¥â¥â¥.
9103	1	a	Fun for awhile. Boring after a while. Played with friends 2 hours in total and got deeply anoid with how this game plays out  5/10 Meh gameplay. Fun for teamplayers
10584	0	a	I enjoyed this game for the very short time I was able to play it. I'm giving a bad review because of a game-breaking bug leaving myself, and many other players stuck out of the game, completely unable to play.  The developers are aware of the bug at this point, and after having many conversations with support about the issue, it seems that they simply don't care.  The bug in question, is getting stuck on the black screen with the grey 'Loading' ribbon across the bottom. Even if left for hours, the game will never actually load. I initially contacted support about this back in February, and I've had to make multiple tickets due to previous ones automatically closing.  To this day, the issue is still unresolved for me. I'll update this review if that changes, but I'll probably leave it as a negative because of what a joke the support team is.  Get your â¥â¥â¥â¥ together, Kabam, you're only harming yourself through losing potential customers.
5600	0	a	Ah, I played this game on G1 till i got sick of it, why? Servers lagging, noobs hacking and unbalanced weapons beside P2W. Yeah it was a 3 years waste of my life.
5224	0	a	i have played this game for nearly 1000 hours. not on steam but when it was just by itself. i can say without a doubt in my 1000 hours, this game is nothing but hunger for money.  Dont bother playing. Pros - Variety of guns Variety of customisation of vehicles and character Fun in groups  Cons - Horrible customer service by APB Money hungry game No body cares about your opinion Hackers left and right Have your account hacked every few months and for APB customer service not to do anything about it. 
326	1	a	Its a great game. Except for the hackers. Get rid if the hackers completely, and it would be alot better.
9090	0	a	Edit: I've got a decent computer so more thoughts on the game are at the very bottom  Similar to APB Reloaded, only that it crashes instead of giving me huge framerate issues, it has many graphical glitches which lead to framerate issues.  I found myself trying really hard to enjoy this game because it's basically a multiplayer version of Fallout, Match made in heaven, right? But it simply just doesn't work at all. All the times I tried to play it, it crashed my computer, even while I was playing on the lowest settings! and to top it all off: these weren't even regular crashes, these were BLUE SCREENS! on WINDOWS 7! I didn't even know these existed on modern systems!   Don't play this game, it has â¥â¥â¥â¥ compatibility.  So, I played the game for a while, it looks sloppy and ugly even on the highest settings, the animations and models look so old and dated. Also the aiming is weird in this game, I'm used to my aim not completely following my crosshair, and instead hitting where the animation plays, which is not how melee works in this game.  So, if you were to attack something with a melee weapon, it may look like you hit it but you haven't, and same thing in reverse. Speaking of combat, you cannot hit NPCs which are too far away (even though it looks like you do, blood and dust does show, but their health bars do not deplete) I can understand this was done to prevent people doing this to players, but come on. NPCs. Seriously.  It's also very boring, but I'll have to give credit for making the game semi-straight forward. Still not worth downloading.
3825	0	a	This game is owned by 'GamersFirst'(HAHAHHAHA, first?), *cough* I mean 'MoneyFirst'. This game is cancer, in it's most advanced form. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE this game , but I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hate it at the same time. Armas Weapons &gt; every other weapon you can buy with in game curency.  Armas Weapons &gt; skill. Skill means nothing in this pile of crap. Get an Arams Weapon for Trial and I guarantee you , that you will wreck everyone that comes into your way. 'Bronze Server' is for Silver and Gold players, and 'Silver Server' is for Gold players. â¥â¥â¥â¥ you 'GamersFirst' for the 'numerous' updates , for the award winning matchmacking system, and for balancing the districts for each ranks.
508	1	a	I feel like the only person who likes this game...
9149	0	a	just sad cannot get game to open been at it for a while unistalling and re installing. attempted to get tech support and it was like standing in a desolate canon to only here my own echos. i have searched firewalls, check my port forwarding and even defraged the game. but to no satisfaction. I am unable to recommend this game or not recomend this gaem do to i cannot even play it. oh well i guess i will go spend my moneys somewhere else. to those who can play the game i hope it is funa nad entertaining.
7973	0	a	If you like pay 2 win, bugs, lag, and s*** gameplay then this is the game for you
8955	1	a	i really liked after you get past the first two hours it alot more open worldly and more fun so ya

10685	1	a	A game about mob mentality and the consequences of mob mentality.
5088	0	a	Game is an overall mess, developers are super indecisive and destroy the fast pace shooter I used to love... Oh and the cash shop is still overpriced.  Edit in Sept 2016 - The game is still just as bad, no engine upgrade still and cash shop is their priority
5636	0	a	This f*cking game, it almost gave me an aneurism. It is so terrible, as my friend Jack mentioned you either fork out $30 for a gun that isn't very good, or grind for weeks for a sh*tty cosmetic item such as shoes. The optimization is awful, the community is a bunch of 12 year olds, cars handle like there's no gravity, and the interface doesen't even work and/or is confusing as sh*t. Hackers everywhere and glitchers constantly killing you. Even with the poor anticheat if there even is one. This game is truly, one of the absolute WORST programs I have ever had on my hard drive. And who the hell sells a $100 DLC that has very little to offer??? Dafuq?  1/10.
4311	0	a	Best character creation to date.
3372	1	a	Rated A for A-holes.
10229	1	a	Same as all free to play games.....WILL NOT START FFS 
2946	1	a	gta for free that is less inapropriate and good game that you can play for hours (criminals are more fun to play) 
3005	1	a	It's the best free game !!!
434	1	a	this game is great but when i start it half of the buildings dont load so its like an invisible maze 
8393	0	a	Extrememly pay to win, can't even play the game since everyone has much better guns, vehicles and clothing, once you drive around the city running down citizens it's no longer fun.
7656	0	a	I thought this game would of been good untill i download and it dosent even open!!!! i would like it if this was not bugged
8776	0	a	I can't say I actually would recommend this game. That doesn't mean it's not a fun game some of the time, but usally it's honestly pretty bad. You'll get lucky if you find some people who aren't hacking, scum bag trolls or self-procalimed 'pro-players.' The people you'll typically run into are your average scum bags who will constantly tell you how bad you are and that you suck and blah blah blah even though they can't seem to win the match either. BUT when you do find some good people and get in a group, the game can be pretty fun. The customization is very good too, plus there should be an game engine update sometime in 2016 as well.   Edit: Yeah that engine update still hasn't happened.
1254	1	a	best game to play,iam addicted
8201	0	a	Game Status Long Ago: Very Playable, Good Latency  Game Status Now: Unplayable, Horrible Latency   The Latency beats over all the customization with nearly 1000 latency playing normal.  The game is just unplayable now.
1896	1	a	BEST GAME!
3042	1	a	Nice game!
1033	1	a	Great game would recoment to anybody wanting action
6543	0	a	The idea of cops versus robbers is an exicting new idea with it having so much potential. APB Reloaded delivers a new and chaotic idea of the dangerous streets of the city of San Paro.  - If your most intrigued by story-line based First Person Shooters, APB Reloaded is not for you. The story is a linear of 'Criminals are causing harm to the city, choose to protect the city or be against it.'  + The customiztion is where this game shines. Most likely, your character won't look like the next persons, with complex and advanced yet simplistic character customization your able to really stand out of the crowd. To the colors of your bandana to the acne and scars on your face, this is the only one reason I always seem to crawl back to this game. Spending hours apon hours can give such a rewarding feel when you remarkably created your very own first ever unique character. Your character is not just the only thing you could customize, the rims on your car, the hood of your car, you could even add a little jingle that your foes will be forced to listen to time and time again when you defeat them.  - A major problem I've encountered during the many hours I've pumped into this game is that the overall gameplay is awful. Huge pay to win aspects floating around every direction you go, match making couldn't ever seem to match me with a suitable ranking, and overall was just a frustrating experience. When I would buy an upgraded Sniper Rifle to counter the other Snipers, I would be picked off in one shot by one across the map, which was purchased with real money. Or if I were to buy any rifle, would get RPG'd with the only warning being that distant beeping noise right before the missle is launched. It keeps you cussing and always feels like your at a disadvantage if you haven't put any money into the game. The city feels rather dull and has a bland approach, and the civilians feel artificially made with no effort put into them besides the modelling and possibly voice acting.  - You can't have a non-gaming computer and be able to play this game. It's rediciously CPU intensive and requires powerful graphics cards to run at High settings with 60+ fps. (From what I remember)  All and all the game brings many laughs while playing with friends for a short while, but I would never consider playing this alone for long periods of time.
616	1	a	stole about 1700$ from me  9/11 would pay again
8843	0	a	I've saw other people saying this is a bad game, I bet it is, but I'll just try it. That is why I got an extra bit of ram to play this game for my birthday.
7831	0	a	Dislike It is so laggy its not my laptop not myversion of windows its the game it self
4014	0	a	The most annoying game I ever played for 4 hours the driving is annoying and the shooting and the constant crashing!
7804	0	a	i used to play this before it was free to play and now its free to play yeah right if you dont pay for good guns your going to have a bad time as every ones gun is better then yours you can shot them a lot they wont die they shot you 3 times your dead and its always with guns you buy with real money so unless you pay you wont play trust me
187	1	a	1) Its Free-To-Play 2) Its like GTA 3) But with your friends.
7016	0	a	It is almost impossible to kill someone with the first level guns, It takes 30 hits from the 1st rifle in the game to kill someone. Then you get blown away with shotguns and more powerful weapons. This is a pay to win game. I played for a day, and it was mostly dying.....
1014	1	a	Lots of fun!!!
5991	0	a	.
2428	1	a	APB Reloaded is a fast paced, shoot em up, Free to play, open world strategy combat MMO; and if you are any good at it, you hate it with a passion.   I recommend it.
7462	0	a	This game is P2W... No match balancing system so if your new and you start, you'll get matched with rank 1-200... most people are donators with 1 shot snipers etc... The makers who made this really dont know how to make a good game.... its â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ terrible
2194	1	a	Its really good and Ienjoy it every single time I play it
9384	0	a	Uninstall works perfect.
4704	0	a	This game is terrible for beginers and horrible for solo play. if you can make friends and play it isnt so bad, but when they are off (and the game is dead so chances are they will not be on) the matchmaking litterally works to â¥â¥â¥â¥ you. G1, who hosts the game, cant give a â¥â¥â¥â¥ about the players, not even the PR Tiggs even plays the game on a regular basis. maybe when the engine update releases the game will be better. RIP APB:R

2788	1	a	Great game just needs to fix the bugs. has a lot of potential tho
1251	1	a	I personally like being able to customize everything in the game the way that i want, plus i really feel like i am the criminal trying to get away with crimes, and watching out for the cops so they don't catch us
2499	1	a	If your waiting for GTA V to come out for the PC like me, this is a fun game to pass time in (assuming you don't want to play GTA IV, of course...)
4335	0	a	I have a 6 month old gaming PC with a top shelf GeForce GTX card and the game errors out at start that my graphics card is not supported. Waste of time downloading and not worth my time trying again in the future.
4141	0	a	i cant play it i just seem to see it stop when i press start \
3251	1	a	The customization is pretty cool on here, I believe.
8469	0	a	APB Reloaded is pretty much deviant art packaged into a .exe. I feel tremendous pain for those who have paid money on this incarnation of this game, which feels like a time capsule as there has still been no meaningful addition to what it offers players even after years of 'development'.  I made a Harlem Globetrotter though so I shall rate this game a 8/10.
7479	0	a	Don't bother wasting any time much less any money with this game. Gameplay is mostly repetitive and frustrating, and the city itself feels lifeless and bland apart from the players.   Can be be fun for a short time if you're with friends, but even then the shoddy gameplay mechanics get in the way of anything but a game of Quack! Quack!
8382	0	a	Oh APB, the years I've spent playing. LAGGGGG. This game is the definition of bittersweet. Customization is the best thing this game has going for it. Create your own music, death themes(can be very annoying), cusomize your cars and customize your player(hair, height, weight, tatoos, ect...). This game has its own little producing software that isn't the best, but worth messing around with. The concept of this game is still great even though the exicution is terrible. There is too much wrong about this game but the worst thing about this game is the community. The missions are repetitive with no real storyline unless you want to read about the story when you level up contacts through the in game mail system. Any gun that give and advantage of course are all P2W exect a few that you have to grind for and buy from the marketplace where players can trade/sell guns, cars, songs, death themes, and logos(more that I can't remember atm). Their subscription is called premium and gives you basically 100% more in came currency and experience towards leveling up contacts(how you unlock non p2w items) The winning team of the mission only really matters who wins the final portion of the mission unless your team sucks much more that the opponents. Matchmaking is terrible although there are not enough players to really balance it. Spawn points can be very frustrating and much bs for the other team most of the time. After years of playing this game, I can say I've wasted hours just to unlock the overpowered nano automatic pistol. Once I obtained this goal, I uninstalled after really giving the game a chance. I cant reccomend this game for anyone to play because it is such a let down and pro players will give you your @$$ on a platter. The devs have promised a game engine update and have not done so. It is well over a year overdue. RIP APB it was fun while it lasted...
7844	0	a	I don't reccomend as it is right now. But for those of you who were with it when the beta began, it's hard to get away from. It's like watching the beautiful development of a piece of art, only for it to break down, get handed to someone else, and tarnished. People now look at it like, 'what is that', we look back and say 'something that used to be good.' Problems with the game- -EVERYTHING YOU MAKE WITH THEIR CUSTOMIZATION TOOLS BELONGS TO THE COMPANY-THIS INCLUDES ORIGINAL DECALS, SONGS, CARS AND CLOTHING DESIGNS-WATCH WHAT YOU CREATE. ONCE IT'S SAVED, IT'S LOST. YOU CANNOT USE SAID DESIGN, DECAL, SONG IN ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL USE WITHOUT THEIR PERMISSION. -Overpriced clothing on the market-We asked for new clothes to wear, they gave us what we wanted-with a price of course(we've got 2 new contacts(what allows players to level up) that have yet to be released, and it was because they 'didn't have enough stuff made for them yet'.) -Graphics are CPU heavy, not GPU heavy. -RAM monster -Ingame matchmaking has yet to be fixed, higher skilled players stomping lower skilled players in the lower skilled players servers. -ARMAS(the commercial store for the game) prices are way too high and misaligned. -Old assets from the previous game before it was revived are refixed and brought back as products on armas for even higher prices. -Servers tend to blank out every now and then. -sub-par cheat detection services. Meaning you'll see cheaters a bit more than usual compared to other games.(its literally the standard punkbuster package. )  Pros- -Ridiculous replayability-Like I said, I've been around since the beta when the game relaunched. And it's got me hooked because I know how the game played before all this stuff started happening. Still trying to walk away from it, but it's a hard battle. -Full Customizaiton-Provided you pay the dough for about 180 dollars per year worth of 'Premium Membership'. Without it, you'll get a taste of said customization. -Unique gameplay-Yes, it's a shootemup, but it's different-The city is your waiting and matchmaking lobby, and your battlefield. -Everyone is different, and has their own unique identity, unlike other MMOs.  And that's about it. new guys, turn around and walk away, maybe come back at the end of the year, things might get fixed then. Old guys, lets try to get the hell outta here.  EDIT-I forgot one more con, the community can spew enough drama to run a spanish soap opera out of business at certain times. So If you do decide to play this game, walk in with a thick skull and be prepared to deflect some crap.

6420	0	a	The gameplay is pretty fun, and the store robbing mechanic is good too.  Sadly, to get better weapons, get cool cars, get different clothes, or anything really, requires you to pay money on the game. I am constantly in fear to get shot down by a guy who did actually pay money, because they have way better gear than me. Playing actual missions in online is also near to impossible, since most of the time one or two people who paid for the game have OP guns in which they carry their team or your team.  If you are looking for a REAL F2P game without others having an advantage for paying, then keep looking..

4897	0	a	Cons: -GTA but P2W and horrible imbalances, with the non-P2W being horribly punished untill you go full out P2W.  -Toxic community, worse than Dota's. Somehow are proud that the game's P2W, probably because they're inferior to everyone in every way so they need to dish out for the best weapons possible to feel good for once.  -Game runs poorly, graphics are completely â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ yet it somehow runs worse than GTAV  Pros:  +Good if you want something to cross the line and help you finally suicide.
4224	0	a	it's awful
10429	0	a	this game has alot going for it. it has good weapon design, a good character creation system, and a great concept but what this game suffers from the most is its bad controls and terrible combat system and the game really suffers from that, its difficult to get immersed when the controls are constantly working against you, but other than that its not 'too' bad and if you dont mind poor controls and iffy combat then id recommend it
7435	0	a	This game is broken and it's getting more broke with every update. Admins ban anyone they want no matter what they did. The lag is apsolutely amazing. If you get frustrated very easily DON'T GET THIS GAME. On the other hand the game is very original and if it wasn't in the uncapable hands of gaymers first maybe it would have been an awesome game!
3983	0	a	this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥
9135	0	a	The graphics are terrible. Now, this wouldnt be so bad if its 2014 and the gameplay trailer had amazing graphics. At least with WoW they made the game a long time ago so its an excuse to not have good graphics, but this? But what is worse is the launcher. It took me 3 DAYS to download this dissapointment. To put that in perspective. I downloaded GTA 5, which is 16 gbs in 1 day. Fix your â¥â¥â¥â¥. The gameplay is clunky and the instructions are unclear. The first person mode is glitchy as all hell, and I could barely walk to the other towns without some high level destroying me. The story looks like it was pulled out of a toddlers imagination and turned into a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ vampire love story for teens. Also, the map is big. And I'm not saying this is bad, its just that the map is WAY TOO â¥â¥â¥â¥ING BIG. It breaks the gameplay and is so boring when I have to walk for 45 minutes just to complete a mission. I may have not played a lot, but I played enough.  Overall, this game is a big, dissapointing pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ 3d models and bad voice acting, peppered with bad camera angles and broken game mechanics. 2/10.
3615	1	a	I love the customization in this game. however the lack of balancing and anti-cheat is insane (LMGs being better then sniper rfles)

2848	1	a	Love this game. It's a nice twist on cops and robbers. The addition to being able to arrest criminals is awesome IMHO. If you're looking for a good Cops vs Robers kidna game this is it.

2015	1	a	This has to be one of the best free2play games that steam has to offer, that's if you have a thing for GTA style games. With the endless customization that involves cars, clothing, music themes, and so on.. this game gives you more possibilities than any other game that has been released.  Pros: Endless amount of customization choices Great Shooting style Easily adaptable for new players  Cons: Not a huge community[Still big enough to enjoy though] Game servers sometimes lag Hackers Griefers [ General multiplayer games have this though]  Driving system seems like it could be better than it is at the moment..  Rating : 8/10   If you're looking for a decent game to play you might as well give this a try and end up becoming addicted, like I have.

10186	1	a	Amazing game, I could play it forever. It's like a free Day Z, or kind of like a mix between Minecraft, Skyrim, and a modern/futuristic mmo. Just awesome. The best free game, or even overall, I have ever played
10203	1	a	It is a fun game. The controls are a bit wonky but it is free and more good than not
1941	1	a	best game ever but no one play mission anymore
2268	1	a	A game not without its flaws. However, when you have a good team together that is in communication, its a fun game, and now that its free to play well worth checking out.
1823	1	a	its good
5511	0	a	Yea FAIRFIGHT whoooooooooooooooooooooooooo (Lets instal this antiCHEAT in all games) Redy BEND OVER get fuc c===3 ked HARD U have 2 options: 1) HACKERS ; 2) P2W players
1210	1	a	Purgatory Simulator 10/10  Will still wait for engine update.    In all seriousness, I love this game, and I have put an absurd amount of money and over five hundred hours into APB:R. Hands down, one of the more unique games on the market, with plenty of oppertunites to make your character truly your own with the customization, etc...  However, I have come to find that I cannot enjoy playing a game with horrendous FPS dips and overall lag issues. As much as I have honed my skill and mastered my weapons in the middle of an intense firefight when the frame rate drops to four or less per second, that can take all the fun out of a game. I want this game to have balance between player and free from those who abuse or manipulate the game, making it drab for everyone. Lately when I log on I cannot play for very long before the urge to quit sets in.   If you can handle unpredictable frame rates and crippling latency issues, then I would definately recommend.
2879	1	a	This is both the game I've had the most fun with but also the game I've been most frustrated with. It's great fun if you're playing in a party of 4, but playing solo or in any less than a group of 4 can be very aggrivating. If you have friends who can play with you, play it - otherwise, you'll just hate it. Also, a large amount of people hack.
2200	1	a	Gameplay is so-so, not bad, not the best. However! The Level of customazation is immense! Character, symbol, and cars can be changed to look EXsactly as you like.

6437	0	a	Outdated graphics, horrible gameplay and controls, when you connect its total chaos. just cause 2 Multiplayer is better.
9456	0	a	Worst game I've tried to download on steam by far.
3217	1	a	Fun game to play. Highly Customizable. However it does get repetivive. Recomended to play with Friends
10570	0	a	I'm going to get a lot of hate for this. I'll just say that at first. but hear me out. The game is impossibly dificult to unlock other classes, and unless you buy money good gear is hard to get. You'll get torn to shreads with no hope of unlocking the next class. I'll say that if this game had a better way for better gear I would gladly play it more, but I'm not going to suport it unless it changes in some way.
1432	1	a	I know this game has a horrible reputation, however I am having quite a lot of fun with this game. Yes, you may run into some greifers (throw a grenade at them, explosions hurt everyone), but other than that, I have been having a lot of fun.  Excellent character, car and clothing editor, interesting mission system. Expect Call of Duty instead of WoW and you might get it.
8590	0	a	i couldnt even run it when i start it would open the launcher and the it finnly loads about after 10 minns and crash gg would crash again 10/1000000000000 IGN
1056	1	a	Very fun
6708	0	a	the perfect game for someone who has days of free time just to get enough money to buy a small amount of things  4.5/10000000
8931	1	a	Want fallout but cant buy it? Here ya go
3505	1	a	Fun game, until you realize you're going to get murdered every round unless you use ACTUAL MONEY to buy FAKE MONEY to buy FAKE GUNS that you only get for a limited time. unless you PAY MORE ACTUAL MONEY to realize that there isn't much more to do.  The outfit and car customization is cool, and there is some cool stuff you can do with it, but ,most things you get ideas to do, you can't. The customization menu for clothing has a limited amout of symbols you can place down, which can limit your creativity in some cases. Same thing goes for the car creator, with an even less amount of symbols you can place. If you have a lot of money to spare and are ok with it going to limited things, then you'll end up with a good looking character and car.  For the rest of you, good luck.  TL;DR: Fun game with customizable cars and outfits, until you realize it's a pay-to-win. Play for a while, don't get your hopes up for something extremely amazing.

6060	0	a	As much as this game has provided me in endless hours of customization and havok-wreaking fun, it has provided me with double the amount of time wondering how a game with so much potential can be so.....broken. From the rampant cheaters to the lack of proper servers the game can be extraordinarily frustrating at times. The game it self is a Cops and Robbers themed MMO, a concept which could have been executed bery well but just seems to fall short in almost every area except for customization. If there is one positive thing that I can say about APB it is the detail and level of customization is astounding and can have even the most uncreative of people tapping into their wild side. This is also the major flaw of the game, as most of the money for development was spent in the Customization Programs.  All in all, this game can be fun at times, but will overall not be worth the time you put into it 5/10
1560	1	a	This game is very addicting! Great game to play with friends!
8134	0	a	i hate this game
9285	1	a	Just impossible to play because of lags most unoptimized game i have ever seen..
1127	1	a	I didn't play much of it, it's okay I guess
10174	0	a	Since I have not played any of the Fallout games, I will not be making any comparisons to Fallen Earth. After playing this for a while, I thought this is a neat concept, but sadly fely this was a wasted opportunity to make a good mmo. First off, it runs like crap on low end computers and overall it felt really boing after a while. I'm pretty sure there are settings to boost performance, but either way, there really isn't all that much to do besides exploring the environment, which happens to be mostly flat desert until you are able to travel far away from the starting area and crafting weapons. Combat is dull as a sack of bricks so you can forget trying pvp since there is no cover and all I have seen is people dancing around in circles since the range on some of the guns are really short. That pretty much sums up on what I have to say about this game so if you like walikng around looking at terrain with occasional crafting then fine, but otherwise your time is better spent on something else.
10498	0	a	I used to play this game a  far  long time ago, back on Kongregate. It was a good game, plenty of fun to be had, and the perma-death, while annoying, only made me more determined to do better in the future, work with my friends, and pursue a higher goal.  But that was a different time entirely; a golden age long since past.  So, around 2 years later, being a more experienced and wisened individual, I decided to check this game out again, seeing it was on Steam. I went into the reviews, and noticed...a surprising negative reaction among a bulk of the players, even ones who've spent over hundreds of hours. I thought to myself,  Well it just can't be as bad as these people say, right? People love to use hyperbole to make a point.  In my lack of judgement, I decided to play this again...  I regretted said decision.  [GETTING STARTED]  So I started up the game after a shockingly-fast install time of roughly 2 seconds. Flash games, gotta love'em. I start things up, go into my character menu, and realize that half the screen's dedicated to selling me crap. That's  not  a good sign...  I start up my one character slot, and I go through the motions of picking my first hero, a Warrior. The tutorial's straight-forward, I blitzed through fairly quickly, and reached the point where I named the account. For review sake, I'll disclose my account username in-game was DMNTDxNem.  [MY EXPERIENCE]  When I first started up my warrior, in the first server I selected, things went overall decently for me. I stuck to the beach, like the game said to, and leveled up to 3 before taking on a little deeper in the forest areas. Reaching around level 5 now, fighting against not only the enemies, but the server lag, I decide a quick respite at the Nexus was in order.  Now, from when I was playing this back on Kongregate, I used to  love  the Nexus! It was crowded pretty often, yeah, but there tended to be a lot of friendly player interaction; people helping each other, constantly working in each other's benefit to get better gear and equipment, there was always strong community there.  But on my return trip to the Nexus during this refresher playthrough, I realized the game's first critical issue:  Bots! Bots everywhere! I couldn't speak to any of the players, as few as there even were around, without bots running up and drowning us out. I cannot tell you how much I desperately wanted to kill some of these players; physically. In real life. I was that angry.  Aside from that, though, there was also the issue of the shop items. Originally, pre-dev change, the shop items, while difficult to acquire, were completely do-able, and it was rather straight-forward; you earn coins, you go to the shop, you spend coins on an item you want (and eventually die and lose, but I digress,) and you got said item. Now, shop items range from the hundreds to the thousands in coin value! And if you came back into the game with 50 coins earned, many of the shop items that were once 50 are now  51 , meaning you'd be forced to pay for one more bloody coin! Slowly, I was realizing that people's anger was rather justified.  Enough about the Nexus and the broken shop, though. I went back in, enjoyed my time fighting through enemy territory, until it appeared the server I was on had a server-wide boss battle occurring. Everyone was teleported into a dangerous, high-level world dungeon: Oryx's Castle. I, among many players, was ill-equipped for the encounter, so I ended up dying along heaps of other players, who all probably experienced the same game-breaking lag spikes that I did. Congratulations, RotMD, you, a flash game, made my high-performance gaming computer buckle onto its knees...  Second go, another warrior, and I was definitely getting the hang of things. I beat a few dungeon bosses, went into the ruins and killed a few mini-bosses strewn across the world, and grabbed some decent equipment. Things were going good, and the whole thing went just as I'd hoped. Barring the several passing exchanges I gave the bots advertising their crummy products, to which I had some choice opinions of them, I finally came across an actual, breathing player; they were running around like the flash, and when I strolled up, they told me about a dungeon where they could help me get some better equipment. Now, I'll say in advance that I read the reviews extensively, and knew there were players who got their kicks off of getting people with good characters killed. I thought to myself,  Well, my guy's crap, so he'd be wasting his time if he just wanted to off me.   How wrong I was.  First off, the dungeon he dragged me into was from some candy dude that was prancing around like the Gingerbread Man. I insisted on being the one to take him down, so a little Looney Tunes-style chase went on, me using mana potions to keep up like Lance Armstrong used drugs for the Tour De France, and finally was able to dead him to death. Me and the guy go in, and before my eyes, he vanishes through a wall...and when he returned, every enemy he could alert in the area was with him. Running as far as I could, not long, considering I used up all my mana, I was eventually shot to death by a unicorn pinata barfing rainbows. And so, at level 9, Sir Gullible II was found dead due to overdose on vibrant colors. The last words he ever heard were from his once-thought ally, typing in '#rekt' about 7 times. Fun times were had..  [GAMEPLAY]  Now, the fact the game now being a botting trollfest of epic proportions notwithstanding, it's still incredibly functional. The base game works as intended, and the system hasn't changed all that much since 2 years ago. Now, I'll admit the difficulty curve's definitely become harder to cope with, especially how the higher-tier equipment is even harder to acquire than ever before, unless you throw your wallet at the screen, but by the by, it hasn't really changed all that much. You still work with other players, you still try for the best loot, and you still fight towards the ultimate goal of taking down the Mad God.  You have your four slots, weapon, helmet, armor, and ring, and equipment is divided amongst different classes, rings being the only ones where any class can use anything they find for that slot. Each class has different advantages and disadvantages; warriors can buff allies and face-tank, wizards can do solid damage, archers can hit multiple enemies at once, they're all viable for different reasons.  Remember, of course, about the perma-death mechanic; once a character's dead, they're dead. Anything they had, if you didn't get it sorted out or saved, is gone, so it's incredibly important to manage the equipment that you find, so that the next time someone throws a death-spewing unicorn at you, you'll have plenty of equipment for the next character that hits the ground.  [SUMMARY/FINAL THOUGHTS]  In all, the game's as it's always been: you play, you die, you improve, you die again, the cycle continues. Granted, there are the more-than-occasional hacking players that either screw you out of loot, or, in my experience, send sentient pinatas to murder you with rainbows, so the cycle is a bit less off a circle, and more of a triangle, where every corner is a slap to the face. You get your first slap when you boot up the game, and you're being asked to buy crap you don't even need; you get the second slap going to the Nexus, once a sanctum for player cooperation, now a den of botting inequity and a broken economy; and the final slap, rounding this merry-go-â¥â¥â¥â¥-yourself out quite nicely, is the afore-mentioned hackers, honing their trolling skills to a weaponized level in the goal of  wanting you dead.   I could go on about how Kabam doesn't care, and how they potentially ruined a good game. But, instead, I'll give them a break, and say this: at least Road-Squared didn't get their hands on this game.
8451	0	a	APB, Back in The Days Of. RealTime, They Had Some Problems With This Game Of Course, But, They Eventually Caught Up With Them Faster Then Most Companies Would, It Was Pretty Much A Dream Game You Just Got Hooked To In A Flash After Testing, After Getting The Ropes Untangled. Then They Died Out And Others Toke Over The Fantastic Game.  ... ThatÂ´s Were All Kinds Of Hell Broke Losse For ME At Least.  RealTime, Never Caught Up To ALL Of The Problems It Had, But, Who Cared Back Then When You Actually Had A Super Fun Game?!  This Was A, Great Game Once, And Will Sadly Never Be Again, As ItÂ´s Riddled With;  * Bugs. * Glitches. * Screwed Up Mission System. * Grindy Then EVER. * Screwed Up, Improvised, Match-Making-Atempt-of-A-System. * Login Errors. * Random Game-System Errors, Never Seen So MANY Different Error Codes Before.  And Feels UnFinished, WhatÂ´s Worrse IS The Use Of PunkBuster, Wich is An Early Warning Flag For These Types Of Games.  However. If You Want To Experiance A Fun, And Totally Epic Game IÂ´m Sad To Say: ' YOU WILL FIND IT!  And Then Crushed When You Realise, YouÂ´r Peared Up Against Someone With 1000+ Hours Of Game Play, And HE CHEATS, Abuses Bugs/Glitches.  When You First Join Up With A Crew (Clan), Rebels Or Enforcers, You Will Get To Learn By Your Mates, HOW YOU ABUSE THOSE BUGS/GLITCHES, This Is A Very Common Practise.  Others, Kick Crew Members Who Are Caught Using Those Underhanded Tactics, At Least There Is Some Sort Of Silver Lining?.......  I Do Not Recommend This Game Anymore For What Ever Reason, It Had ItÂ´s Prime Days,Now They Are Simply Gone. IÂ´d Say Take Care APB &amp; Rest In Peace.... ~ Cries *

884	1	a	Don't Know What To Write . Just Give It A Like
10634	0	a	{Rant}  Game used to be one the most fun games I will ever have played but new developers have ruined it to its core. Too many micro-transactions and a lot of focus on paying to win basically. Pets are the key to survival which are insanely hard to get up to speed without farming trench's or etc. for a long time without paying money. And all new dungeons, and items, and in general game updates are focused around spending money for top tier gear whether it be the mystery box with a low chance for an extreme payout, or buying 'tops' straight up. 8 '8/8's' no longer feels like I earned it since anyone can buy tops and farm fairly easily (but most likely die and give me a good laugh), UT's drop frequently and the game just feels like a massive, overpowering player base with no challenge any longer (especially with pets) and is just a waste of time to farm.  {Summary} Large changes such as UT's being non-tradeable or the disappearance of amulets is not what ruined the game, it's the most recent p2w schemes, aka mystery box of profit that tear away from the core point of farming and finally having the RNG in your favor for that moment when you've achieved a great set after good work, not having exclusive items in the mystery box that won't be in a dungeon for 3 months...  {Suggestion} I love Warframe and League of Legends, for some reason a LOT of RoTMG players left for league, not sure why but I was hooked also so check them out, realm is just not worth the time any longer. And Warframe gives a perfect feel for the payout for time you put in farming, very Face of Mankind esque but updated constantly and very satisfying to play unlike another great games downfall.   (The Big Lebowski) Has the world gone crazy? Seen too many games go to â¥â¥â¥â¥....
5212	0	a	This Game I Dont Like, Cant Even Run it.
10925	1	a	Fellow supporters of my cause, the 'Take back Pakistan for Call Centers and Jobs Awareness Association for People Who Are Muslim' find this game to be very enjoyable. Like murdering infidels families and then having a nice meal of sheep intestine for dinner. Praise Allah, may the Mad God be with you.
10369	1	a	PS2 graphics...  WoW harvesting mechanics and a little more detail than WoW crafting.  The controls were made by a 5 year old... if you have a multi-button mouse a good scroll wheel and you don't mind pressing Tab every 5 seconds it's not that bad.  The combat mechanics are sluggish, ranged weapons are the way to go as anything melee doesn't hit even though your weapon passes right through them.  Most of it is like as if WoW and EVE Online had a baby that was missing a limb or two &gt;.&lt;  It takes at least the first couple missions to get over the learning curve of the game mechanics and controls, other than what I mentioned at the start it gets better quickly... you also get a mount (horse) right at the starter area so it's great for exploration.  I'll be playing more of this game to see how far I can get in it without it being dullified otherwise I would recommend this to anyone who want's an WoW/EVE Online game experience, yes it takes real-time to craft things, it takes 'Skill Books', you are a clone, you have to mine/salvage minerals to craft... it's all pretty much an EVE Online game made 3rd/1st Person shooter.
1186	1	a	im on both yes and no to this game.the bad thing is u need to use real cash to buy special equipment and the server lobby aint that good but still this is a good game
9669	0	a	dont know how to log in 
1382	1	a	YOU HAVE TO BUY IT!!!!!  at first your going to think that the graphics are superbad,i dont care about graphics if its a good and fun game which this.I had this for about 1 month it is a super good game i am normally a envorcer.   BEST GAME I HAVE EVER GOT BESIDES GTA5!!!!!!!!!!!
6774	0	a	I installed this game as soon it was released as free to play, but the game was pay to win from day one so I eventually stopped, and I'll explain why.  I understand that this game needs pay to win elements in order to recoup costs and generate revenue, but there is a universal line which the company has unfortunately crossed.  Pay to win items in this game include fast cars and premium firearms far deadlier than the stock firearms which otherwise would have taken days to weeks to earn, if at all. Not only that, all weapons are subscriptions that need to be renewed. That is the line that should never be crossed. Pay to win elements should never award any significant advantage over the default elements. If it does, the quality of gameplay is flushed down the toilet and it's not a real game anymore.  In summary, the only way to be good in this game is to buy the deadly premium weapons on which the company has unabashedly placed exorbitant pricing, and apparently most players do so every day. It is the only way to have any amount of fun in this game, unless you enjoy being unfairly DM'ed.  And this is from my experiences a few years ago, which I haven't written about at the time because the review system hadn't existed then, plus I haven't thought of writing one until now. The system hasn't changed, nor will it ever, because why would the company scrap the system that generates probably the majority of their dirty profit? Unless you are willing to spend hundreds of dollars a month on this one game, I strongly suggest looking elsewhere to satisfy your daily cravings of online shooter fun.
8342	0	a	The character creation is awesome, but that's about it. I just dont even want to think about it. It's pretty damn bad. It could be so much more if it were in better hands. Sorry to everyone who worked on it.

1405	1	a	i like the game but it just freezes for me when i play the game so yeah
6185	0	a	Game has become pure pay 2 win, years after release there are still a number of issues with the game with lag within the game, hit detection being completely off, glitches in mission scripts causing one sided games.
5542	0	a	&lt;-- my first reaction of how bad this game is   Pros: +A lot of customization +Free  Cons: -Pay to win -Bad graphics -â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ matchmaking -No proper tutorial -2 hours is wasted into creating your character  Final verdict: Terrible game which sounds good, DON'T play it 4/10

1196	1	a	The game is good yet bad at the same time. When I played it, many months ago, I enjoyed it to an extreme but there were far too many hackers, much less so with the incorporation of Fairfight.. It was a highly P2W game, and still is, but the benefits for paying can easily be countered by guns that you do not have to buy. I used a gun that I got with in-game currency and slaughtered many people that played with weapons they bought using real money. So, the pay to win aspect can be countered by those who do not buy weapons making it still, somewhat fair.  I would love to continue playing the game but I can't. The reason for this is because the company has 3 rank servers set up; bronze, silver and gold. Each of these servers are based on your skill. If you are amazing, you are thrown in the gold server which has very very few people in it, almost none, making it impossible to play. I am a gold, based on my skill, but I can't play because nobody is in the gold server. The only way you can get into the other servers is by dying a lot or joining a silver-ranked friend. I don't have any friends on that game who still play so how can I join them and how can I die if there is nobody in the gold server to play with?  All in all, I like the game but it would not be worth paying for. I recommend that anyone reading this review would try the game, as it is free, but don't put any money down on it. Many people don't recommend the game but people still play it. Check the game out for yourself before judging.
6276	0	a	New to the game, Games Community calls you a â¥â¥â¥ and tells you that you suck Trying to do Tutorial, everyone teams up on you to kill you  Nobody will welcome you Everybody will hate you   Pay to win, everybody will like you  worse than Call of Duty, Clash of Clans, Flappy Bird, and Grand Theft Auto combined
5163	0	a	Okay, I don't write reviews at all so don't take this as a grain of salt but a whole flippin' mineral.  It's bad. I downloaded this because of nostalgic memories, playing this at my exes house and actually somewhat enjoying it. This was what? 4-5 years ago. Not sure what human smashed their head off the keyboard to produce the code and ideas I see present now.   As I write this the game is loading, I just checked and it disconnected me. Now, that sounds all fine and dandy if it wasn't the second if not third time this has done this....  Honestly, the only reason I have 5+ hours on this game is because 2 was spent on customizing my character and the rest was loading screens or errors.  Save your time and find a better game.    Love, a disappointed and drunk peep.
3253	1	a	Crim teams full of cheaters. Crashes all the time. Guns work for others but not for you. Free to play.
6328	0	a	Had high hopes for the game, and had anticipated it for some time, sadly the game wasnt what id hoped for, im sure some will like it, those who were leveled up certainly seemed to like it, but on my end it was kinda confusing whis is as deeply negative as i intend to go in my review
3477	1	a	Have not played this game in quite some time but when I did, it was good. Anyone care to explain what happened and how they ruined it?
4517	0	a	It was pretty good,but now it's pretty bad.
2936	1	a	DUDE YOU GOT TO FIX THIS I CANT EVEN PLAY
8602	0	a	it's like when you click the video with the really cool and interesting looking thumbnail only to realize what you came for is not actually in the video  its just pay 2 win, you cant buy a gun permanently without a trillion coins or real money same with everything else  summary:  https://youtu.be/Qg4SVGFbPZk?t=65 
9512	1	a	this game is bert 
9099	0	a	This game is insanely bad, i downloaded it because the pictures on steam made it look fun and an open world mmo, it is the exact opposite. all of the missions have bugs in them. if you looking for a survival game go download dayz. because this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing terrible. i wouldnt even waste my time downloading it if i were you
2497	1	a	Certainly at its best when playing with a group of friends. Sure the game might try to reason with you to spend money on the game (Decals limits, exclusive items, powerful weapons, increased EXP rate) and have bad community where in my case, people swearing left and right and accusing of hacks. It has bugs but if you're with someone you call as a friend it's easy to let those errors slip aside. If you have someone playing the game, give it a try. If not, well you can try and make friends over there.
4631	0	a	Just go play GTA4 multi!
2932	1	a	If your short on money or just want to have fun, this is the game for you. When you start up the game, you are told that some city somewhere has gone into complete anarchy. The government has passed a bill that allows vigilantiasm to try and bring down the crime rates. You are then told to choose a side 'Criminals' the Anarchists, who can Mug people for money, steal cars and sell them for money or plow there cars into store windows and steal all of the items that fall out and sell them for money. Or you can choose the 'Enforcers' the vigilanties, who can do missions for money. They can still 'Steal' cars but they have a special badge that makes it ok. You then create your character and give him/her a name and you are ready to play. Basically you roam around the city waiting for a mission to pop up. When one does, people from around the city are randomly selected and put onto two teams. (Recomendation cut short because steam caps the character limit) basically its good dl it.
66	1	a	APB reloaded is a great game in my opinion. The costumization in this game is just insane. Over a million combinations possible with your character and vehicle design. Upgrades onto your weapons, character and car. Such as 'Increased car explosion radius' Or 'Mobile ammo box' Or for your charcter 'Kelvar implants' .... It's insane.  The gameplay is extremely fun to play, but also extremely easy to make you rage. My advise would be to play for short whiles. About 1 hour, take 15 minutes break and another hour. Other then all that, it's no P2W (You can buy weapons, but everything is normally achievable without having to pay), and you can really â¥â¥â¥â¥ around with people, it's funny as hell!. My rating on this game is 8.5/10
8547	0	a	This may have differed now, but when I played this game, the landscape was a barren wasteland with nobody in it. (Not literally a wasteland) Also, it was hard as hell to find things to do but roam around. Half the time you would just be getting shot by other players and they are way better than you, so you can't do anything about it. It is also a GTA Clone. And by Barren I meant there were no NPC's you could ever find 2.3/10 -Wasn't Very Fun
8793	0	a	Can't even launch the game anymore. Tried every possible fix or workaround. Reinstalled 3 times.
1601	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s!
8082	0	a	Simply a huge load of crap.
4438	0	a	Pay2Win. If you like throwing tons of cash into a game to destroy everyone else who isn't sad enough to do it then this is the game for you.   10/10 would unistall again.
9832	1	a	it is a good MMO I like it it is not the best but not the worst
8558	0	a	The developers should be ashamed of turning such a great game into the most notorious P2W garbage. They better upgrade the engine soon or I quit APB.
1180	1	a	vewry fun game a litlle laggy but its free 2 pay so i cant complain but overall very fun
6499	0	a	Whoop de doo. I played this game before it came to steam, but I couldn't write a review because I hadn't played it on steam. Great.  So I installed it, started it up, shut it down and uninstalled it.  That's right, I never went to actually play it here in steam. Why? Because, if it's only half as bad as I remember, then you want to stay far away from this game.  Bad matchmaking, elitst jerks, hackers, money hungry developers, and much more. The company making it calls themselves ''gamersfirst''  ... Don't get me started. but hey, if you're filthy rich and don't know what to spend all your money on. This game is it.  I won't bother telling anything else, everyone who's given this game a thumbs down is summing it up pretty nicely.  It's too bad, really. I loved the concept, and I always enjoy character customizations with few limits. 
6771	0	a	There's Hackers everywhere, pay to win, people with auto aim mods and I get banned for cursing while these kids walking with moded guns. Dont play this unless you into getting destroyed by hackers and paying players.
6928	0	a	It won't let me close the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing gamw !
8208	0	a	Couldn't even get this thing downloaded, much less play the damn game. I wouldn't reccomend even trying, as they obviously just want to scam you into spending cash.
9895	1	a	Its a fun game, but it can be very buggy!
7464	0	a	May just be me, but I feel there is a high Pay2Win issue with this game. Nice idea, but I feel like everyone can plow you over.
10062	0	a	The game's â¥â¥â¥â¥
2079	1	a	This game is dardy. i have played it for 3 years now and i still cringe every time i get back on it &lt;3
1615	1	a	nice free game
5597	0	a	This game is awful and installed Search.Conduit onto my pc, which is a malware toolbar program which took over an hour to fix and i'm still certain that its still got some files on my hard drive... install at your own risk.  it changed my homepage from google to Search.Conduit  Took several uninstalls and involved CCleaner to remove it from my pc. needed to delete my internet explorer back to its default settings.  Please don't install this game.
540	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ servers, hacker, pay to win.. but a lot of fun!  
6373	0	a	  Piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ game that cant download
6454	0	a	This game is fun for the first few hours and has amazing options for character customization, but gameplay quickly becomes shallow and meaningless and has a very strong 'pay-to-win' feel. The anti-cheat security was terrible when I played the game and was a deciding factor in giving up on this title.
9441	1	a	Took six hours to install the game. Took another two hours installing updates. All this to crash repeatedly on start up. 9/10 great progress bar simulator.
4411	0	a	got banned for no reason and the severs sux
1954	1	a	After I spent 570 Hours on this game and Unfortunatelly I am still going , because yes it is a great Idea and a unique game, similar to it in no other console, it combines 'Sims' (Full Character customization) , Call of Duty(for its shooting nature and the full customization on weapon mods skins etc), Bit more than Need for Speed (for its customization on your cars), GTA (Open world maps you drive around doing missions or troll people by ramming them over or turn their cars upside down when you're bored to run a mission), These are all the advantages, lets see the Disadvantages, Old Unreal Engine, Hackable big time, we bump into hackers all the time during weekends, lag spikes, shots won't register and one day you rock the next day you shoot the actual player and no shots will register on him.  I ve spent money on this game and responsibly I am advising you, there's no actual quality in this game at the moment, It is fun to play good idea, but no Actual quality, it is full of bugs, hacks , it is not a game to take seriously and sucrifice sleep for game-play, recommending this game just because it is a good unique idea, and we had some good times with friends and the great community this game has gathered, unfortunately most of it is gone, soon will update my review with the current most populated servers on 2014 to save you New players some time.

8495	0	a	Gameplay is not smooth at all, and it is unoriginal. Well, atleast I did not loose any money, time, or my soul to this game
5731	0	a	Doesn't work, can't play for the servers is down, shouldn't be on steam if it requires constant connection to a server!
10722	1	a	Awesome game. Highly recommend
10449	1	a	HEY is alright

10200	1	a	This game looks great and it's gameplay is good too!
8932	1	a	This game is fun Just needs players.
6589	0	a	Too much to set up before playing, too much time for account creation and a million hours for the loading screens. Oh.. and let's not forget lag
10089	1	a	I guess if I had to make it short and sweet it's like Fallout but with a much larger focus on crafting and multiplayer, so I suppose if you enjoy fallout you'll enjoy this
3099	1	a	one problem is figuring out wht weapon you want because it dosent show weather it is semi burst or full auto
1832	1	a	it like gta but only online 
9706	0	a	its fallout done wrong
8514	0	a	Anyone know why i cannot join the game. Im from mongolia so i think its restricted or something. It said this acc is already on use or some error numbers. For the developers fix this thing if you create this game for people to play. Make things full pleasure. Not for money. For future technology of game.You can make money from this but not just for money. Remember this. for the review i give 4/10. Who have same problem and same feelings with me ??
10484	1	a	Fun, little funny. But you know, its an everyday thing to get ate by a mutant chicken right?
10137	1	a	Like a less fun version of fallout but its free!
1627	1	a	APB Reloaded is a free to play game that allows the player to either be a crimminal or enforcer, or both. With all the guns, cars, accesories, and missions, this game is something you should definetly play
1141	1	a	Good If You Can Run It Sad That I cant my CPU is to low thats all it is why i cant run it

6983	0	a	i could not conferm my email address due to the fact that the site was unavailable.
4851	0	a	i playing this game for 4 years ' Non steam ' .... i can say apb is a great game but devlopers so much love money.they ONLY add new weapons and cars and etc to REAL cash marketplace... 
4987	0	a	So I was eating this Chipotle burrito, and some of the meat fell out the back.  I really wanted to eat the meat with the tortilla, but I didnât want to get my hands all messy and I didnât have any utensils next to me, but I did have one certain disc next to me.  Thatâs about how much value this game is worth, the price of a plastic spoon.
8413	0	a	A dumbed-down and broken version of Saints Row.
9063	1	a	This game is by far one of the more enjoyable post apocalyptic mmorpg's combat is fun and interesting, the stat system is simple yet complex as you can choose what you want to be able to do in the game making it a unique experience for each indivual player. All in all a fun game to play either alone but more fun if you can get a group together making encounter's much easier.
8233	0	a	I cant get it to run so bad review. says failed to initiate nvidia physx so whatever. I tried to fix it but cANT
9971	1	a	Free to Play version (no limitations, you're only faster leveling up if you're premium) of Fallout.
7884	0	a	This game is a pay to play type of game, when it first came out before I had steam the game was fun. But now its disappointing to say the least. I am sure if you had plenty of spare money to just throw at the game then it would be fun again. Not to mention, that people are rude. Even people who are 'supposed to team with you' they will do whatever it takes just to mess up the game or mission' needless to say... I dislike it. It is free however. Definitely wouldnt waste hard earned cash on it though.
8944	0	a	Lens flare, dubstep, overly choppy graphics, cheap knock offs, ingame purchase, super zombie apocalypse 5, with new and improved mechanics and gravy over everything crap.   Pass  
833	1	a	Really fun to play with friends and just fool around or get serious and have a few games here and there. Been a long player and re-discovered this jewel on Steam a while back. Too bad that the servers have gone to ****, framerate problems and the skillcap to play is just too high for new gamers to get into. Every person is a pro or either a hacker, no new players to be found. If you're ready for a hard ride and have some friends who are into shooters then go on and play this.
1177	1	a	This game is great playing with friends and other people, but is very boring when it comes to single player standards.  8/10.
801	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ 10/10
1880	1	a	game is pretty cool
1270	1	a	
10299	0	a	Boring, alot of walking, cool ideas but it's not what I'm looking for in a game.
1060	1	a	Very nice Graphic and background i like game but need uptade case add ant weapon to sell steam Market
1231	1	a	I played this during alpha when it was broken as â¥â¥â¥â¥, would play again, maybe.
3810	0	a	This game has been technologically stagnant for years, and hasn't (as far as I know) seen any patches that truly improved its performance. Unless you have an SSD and 8GB+ of RAM, don't even bother. Chances are the game will be nearly unplayably laggy for you, as it is for the vast majority of players.  On top of that, the game is  heavily  monetized, and takes every opportunity it can to shove all the various ways you can spend money on it down your throat.  Gamers First? More like Money First.
383	1	a	I've tried it, but my pc cant run it. It looks fun though
1574	1	a	I like this game 9/10   Hackers :D    great game   alot of people play it
6089	0	a	Would be fun if balanced, but its not.  Pros: Its pretty almost like GTA, and you can drive a car YAY! And also pay money to look like, well a bunny, or something stupid like that. Thats it... Cons: Why a bunny? Because nearly every firefight ends with you being bunny hopped at close range. How many seats does the car have? WHY would that matter if you can simply ride on TOP of the car? Shooting at a car is fairly useless, tires dont blow out. Driver cant be killed unless they exit the car. You can then just bunny hop on them. The whole game is build around buying stuff on their annoying marketplace. Why give the player a choice of 5 FREE GUNS for 10 days, if they can simply go to the marketplace and try a BETTER gun for free for a day, theres more then 10 to choose from. The NPCs are useless. The only missions you do are random ones by selecting READY, that is not an RPG. Servers are unbalanced. Guns unbalanced. Half the time getting into your OWN car takes over 3 seconds. People shoot a grenade at your feet and arrest you, and you can do nothing. You play for 10 seconds, and then wait 30 seconds to respawn. There is no teamwork at all, just rushing the enemy 'beach of normandy style' till they die from being overwhelmed. Loading time is HORRIBLE, connecting to server takes forever, just to find out that there is only 3 people there and you need 4 to play. Weapons are kinda sad, lots of choices but are basiclly the same, you buy ammo manualy, cuz they gotta drain your in game money on something I guess. Thanks a lot. Sorry im tired of typing...
9050	1	a	good game look like Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 3 but More fun....... The difference between fallout and fallen earth..... her you can play withe other player do your mission and you can rid a car are a horse for your mission Instead of walking in fallout to your mission   how love fallout i recommended to play this game it will be a good challenge    
8846	0	a	I've wasted too much money on this game. Don't consider downloading it, even if it's free. It's completely pay to win, bad engine, bad service, bad company everything is bad, except the customization. 
5972	0	a	The cops should be bots.
7473	0	a	it is not bad
1171	1	a	Recommended for Free2Play and casual play.   After pushing myself to try this game out for a couple of hours it just didn't have what it took to pull me in and keep me entertained. This style of MMO can be fun but it is very obvious that APB Reloaded is a 'take and hold' type of game with a p2w factor included.   I do appreciate a game of this quality to be free2play however and the devs did a nice job in the creation of something better than a quest to collect and bring back flowers. The quests are easier to understand after a bit of time invested but very obvious that development could be better in terms of questing.  If you are looking for a way to kill time by the same objective over and over in a GTA-limited style, then this game is for you and there is no problem with that. In my opinion, it just doesn't have that hook I look for in games.  
9809	0	a	the best thing about this game?  the uninstall button
574	1	a	If you tired of GTA 4 PoliceMod Here You Are . You choose to leave a life of crime or protect the dumbass city , its fun but matchmaking sucks . When your lvl 1 you go against a lvl 30 or something its so stupid , but fun . I realy wish there was a 50\50 button so I could recommend it so I give this a 50\50 , 5\10 4\8 2\4 1\2 ALLTHE HALVES
4938	0	a	When you think about character customization, you may think of some asian mmo... well wrong. No other mmo will give you that much pleasure form creating your own character.  Everything your character do is what you do and when you are owning the game, it feels good. Endless fight between enforcers and criminals is just briliant.  At the beginning everyone thought cheaters (coz they r no hackers) will destroy the game and you know hat? We were all wrong. Killing cheating noobs was fun, but(t) real stab in the back was delivered by GamersFirst.  From sexy game concept, they made dirty moneygrabing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. It's completely unbalanced, clunky, and it's PAY TO WIN and what GamersFirst did is unforgivable. It's a shame that they turned APB into pile of filth.  As much as I like this game, I can't recomend it. It should die and maybe after few years someone less greedy than them will remake it just as it should be.  Selling guns is killing this business, leave the game don;t download it let it die or maybe it will force GamersFirst to put gamers first for real.
2560	1	a	pay2win â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t that I will likely play again with my friends because I remember that my avatar in game is really tall, has a great tan, striped panties, and DEM HIPS. â¥â¥â¥â¥.
2666	1	a	this game is really fun to play plus its free!
764	1	a	Best 3rd person shooter out there , and it's free! 
1150	1	a	Good: It's a good game with a big map. You can play with you freinds and spend a holy day of you life on this game!  Could be better: I think the should remove Auto-ready.  Stars: 4,5 out of 5   :D good game   Signed DanishAllstarsGaming 
2224	1	a	Steal Cars/City Massacre/ Who Cares about the actuall story and challenges: The game  10/1  10x better than humanly possible!
7613	0	a	this game sucks
8854	0	a	So bad it is literally forcing me to close down steam in the task manager just to even be ABLE to uninstall it.
10113	1	a	Its a very good game but very laggy on my low spec pc!
2010	1	a	This â¥â¥â¥â¥ is literally â¥â¥â¥â¥ing flawless. Okay well maybe the only flaw is that i wish the map was bigger and there was alot more new content. But you will enjoy this â¥â¥â¥â¥ for a while then come back to it over time. Too bad they're too lazy and understaffed to make new real content. User content can only go so far, although there is plenty of that in this game that anybody can create, even you.
3176	1	a	Good game a crap load of bugs, for instance it won't even install.
4227	0	a	I could not register an account because there was a add covering the create account button that i could not exit out of.
2184	1	a	Fast cars, Sweet guns, and money (that isn't yours) sounds amazing, but when you play the game, you get to live it.
9893	0	a	If your the kind of person who thinks shoving broken glass in your â¥â¥â¥â¥ is relaxing leisure, then you will LOVE this game.
110	1	a	its nice but too much hackers
9445	0	a	If this game had players, and an ACTUAL endgame BESIDES PVP... it would be pretty damn good.. but the flaws in the game are just so ridiculous it's beyond the scope of f2p to even tolerate. They STILL havent done anything significant with the game despite having years of live time.   Skip it, and just let it die gracefully.
9165	1	a	this game is cool and free:)))
2833	1	a	Cool, Game, Very GTA but with mates.
6647	0	a	At 1st it was kinda like playing GTA online but after playing for while, it gets boring pretty quick.
1219	1	a	lots of fun
7490	0	a	This game is broken and it's getting more broke with every update. Admins ban anyone they want no matter what they did. The lag is apsolutely amazing. If you get frustrated very easily DON'T GET THIS GAME. On the other hand the game is very original and if it wasn't in the uncapable hands of gaymers first maybe it would have been an awesome game!
2977	1	a	Free game similar to GTA
8965	1	a	I played little of this game. But so far great game! I just wish it was more like dayz where you loot off the ground and in buildings and if you die in pvp you lose gear thats what i like but its still a good game.
8199	0	a	Until this became 'pay to win' it was a very enjoyable game. I spent many hours with friends running down cons in our pimped out squad cars. I was happy to pay the minor monthly fee back then for that bit of near hackerless fun and no PTW store. I noticed a lot of 'features' cost $ that before the changeover didn't, a way to make an extra buck for the devs I guess.
2645	1	a	Nice game,good idea - 'Cops vs. Thugs' ,I like that you can create character how you want.
4771	0	a	Do you see those 25+ hours I have on record for this game? Not a single second of that was in-game play-time. You see, it actually took me more than 25 hours of trying to get the game to actually start to realize that no matter how good the game was, it wasn't worth it. So, ignoring whether my computer is just screwed up (which I doubt, I've never encountered this problem in other games) or something, I can't quite say that I recommend this game to others.
6396	0	a	Got me a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Virus and Error,DO NOT DOWNLOAD,i recommend,DO NOT DOWNLOAD,i recomend again.
8829	0	a	tried to launch this game for 5 hours ;{
5561	0	a	This game...its just bad. It is a pay to win, lag to the max, community worse than fallout deathclaws, and just a failed product that is now just there in the garbage. The creators dont care about the people or what happens. 10/10 would not give a dam again.
8835	0	a	It's like Crackdown and GTA if they both sucked

2764	1	a	very fun game minus tryiing to get mney oterwise I reccomend this game
10730	1	a	probably the most weird nonsenseable game ever but its a fun 8-bit bullet fest...swords shoot bullets everything does. but death pisses me off.i loose all my good loot.
8961	1	a	If you like fallout 3, this is the closest thing to it in an MMO. I am addictted to this game. Has older graphics but if you don't care about that, i would recomend it. I mean come on it's free.
3662	1	a	this game could really use melee weapons and a skill try so the player can build his/her character and i would love to bet the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of people with a baseball bat or something but besides that it is pretty fun 
4003	0	a	-Pay to win -Crappy vehicle controls -Physics suck  -Unclear for new players -Literally nothing to do  TLDR I want a refund and the game's free.
9265	0	a	good game, no multi lanuge, to much bugs, looks pay to win, uninstall best way
6223	0	a	Can't login useing steam
427	1	a	Still funny after 5 years gaming
2715	1	a	Great game before it went free to play.
541	1	a	help... i... cant.. stop....
8164	0	a	You CAN have some fun while playing with friends, but as of 2015 it's waaay better to just get yourself GTA V and play Online with your buddies
8248	0	a	took 1h to download played 10min got bored 0/10 would never play agian and btw such hackers .-. 
4668	0	a	bronys, â¥â¥â¥â¥in weirdos and aimbotters
3962	0	a	A prime example of a great concept that is run into the ground by profiteering â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s.  The Pay-to-win aspect besides, the gameplay is extremely repetitve and is basicly a deathmatch third-person shooter with cops vs robbers theme. The only redeeming aspect about this game is it's customization, which is yet to be matched by any other game. Just pretend you're playing Playstation Home and you're all good to enjoy this game.
2705	1	a	loce this game
6030	0	a	played it 200+ hours and 2013~2015  not changed anything about balance and hackers  -10/10 worth play it
9924	1	a	If you can't wait for a Fallout MMORPG, then here's the closest thing. You'll have to live without V.A.T.S., but since I don't see how that would work in multiplayer without making it turn-based anyway, this will more than satisfy your needs for a giant post-apocalyptic world to explore and survive in. Plus crafting i s awesome. Oh and ENDLESS ways to personalize your character&lt;3
9736	0	a	The engine is so bad that my grandmother dont want to play this game.  
579	1	a	11/10 would play but wouldn't cuz edgy to hate it all.

8860	1	a	How to do a review for a game that you spent over 3000 hours playing? Could it be objective? Hardly. But i will try at my best to keep it real as much as it is possible. First off, this game is not old. Its ancient.  Graphics  are, by todays standards, in world that saw titles such as Crysis, CoD:AW, Battlefield or Witcher series, laughable at best. It looks old, it ''plays'' old, but it has some of its charm for it.  Story ? Interesting, starting parts are very cohesive, but later on its starts to be very watered down.  Gameplay ? That depends solely on player. There are multiple things you could do ingame (crafting, pvp, pve, farming, exploring, ect), and it works well on its part, but some features definately need to be worked on. I could spend hours explaining each part separately, but generally, game has complex crafting system, pve is fun as far pve goes in other games (there are bosses, instances, dungeons, team raids, ect), farming and harvesting are nice way of getting materials in large quantities if you dont mind posibility of being attacked while doing so (depending on place where you farm/harvest). Over the course of playing i met lot of interesting people. Some were nice, some were not, but all around, Fallen Earth has (or had) one of best comunities around in MMO's. There is always someone who will help out new player, give some usefull advice, share money, resources or items. There are also individuals who organise various community events. One of biggest problems most post apocalyptic games have is that they are constantly being measured towards Fallout universe games. That is a problem, since most games do not measure up to Fallout. Fallen Earth is one of games that comes very, very close to that. Not the same, but not too much diferent from it. Each of those games has its own pros and cons. Sadly, at current time, it seems that G1 (company who owns FE) isnt too much interested in adding new things (although they do occasionally, but not to extent from before), but we always hope they will come to their senses and finish polishing the diamont that Fallen Earth is, and make it shine as it should.
1702	1	a	dude this game is a o mazing 
8462	0	a	The game is good, but it is buy to win so â¥â¥â¥â¥ it...
9836	0	a	Looking at this, I was expecting a Fallout-ish experience. I was mistaken, but not by much. Don't let the play time fool you, I played a good 50 hours of this outside of Steam. Pros: -Crafting -Exploration -Factions -Multiple starts -Many weapons -Steampunk feel -Reminiscent of New Vegas without being a clone -Very open  Cons: -Glitchy -Crafting system is a bit confusing -PvP is populated almost entirely by hackers -Optimizatin is â¥â¥â¥â¥ -Players are generally ill-tempered -AI isn't verry Intelligent -Quests can be a handful at times -Aiming likes to twitch, making long-range shots hard -Leveling system is a pain  Neutral: -Tutorial can be a bit confusing on your first run through -Graphics are a bit dated -Kinda empty (Not sure if they're going for the 'Wasteland' feel)  Overall, it's fun to play with friends for a week or two, but not something I'd sink another 50 hours into
2272	1	a	Played it for a bit. Awesome once you play it for a while but throughout you'll always meet p2w players with better gear.
8660	0	a	Didn't play for two minutes before I was shot and killed by my own team for doing a mission objective. Tried a few more times and same thing. What a great way to start a game,being tk'd and cursed out. This was on the American server so it could be different on European/Asian servers. Community ruined it as constant barrage of insults filling the message box for the most inane things(not even related to my own noobiness). It was like a bunch of junior highers hitting puberty at the same time and not knowing what to do with all the new hormones invading their system. Instead of saying 'hey we don't raid this because it gives us a serious disadvantage or hold out here' you get called 'stupid *&amp;^%()$ trainee' for doing what the game instructs. Don't even want to know if there is a good game underneath it all. Eve online's community is more forgiving.  Edit:The concept and gameplay are quite solid but the lag is terrible. I know it's not just on my end due to user reviews along with people screaming in unison about it while playing. I just can't give it a thumbs up as of yet.
4193	0	a	Have you ever had a moment in your life where you're excited and ready to go? Starting APB was like that for me. I made my character, grabbed a gun, and went out into the world of gang violence.  Much like real gang violence, I was repeatedly brought low by people who bought better weapons than I could, could use the same weapons I had to better effect, and was matched up in a 'fair' fight against people who were like gods to me as an ant. even my car could best be described as a thin plastic shell around a chunk of explosive that functioned as an engine. Within 16 hours of gameplay, I had made every possible worst decision, from choosing a shotgun with the spread the size of a small house, to attempting any sort of PvP at all when close-quarters fighting meant gangbangers instantly ending my life repeatedly with SMGs and sniper rifles, while assault rifles were used to pick opponents off from 100 meters away. Any attempt at buying improved weaponry to escape the hellish catch-22 of ranking up to get new weapons was met with a paywall, and those who bought these rank-exempt weapons were unto demigods in their own right, as these 'same but different' weapons had the characteristics of their real life counterparts. Which, of course, meant they could actually kill you, unlike the peashooters and feather guns regular players are given. All in all, it's the standard Korean MMO pay-to-win format, but with guns and cars. Good if you need to be humbled or have the reflexes of a supercomputer.
1855	1	a	this games is so amzing it is da best game ever i love it
4879	0	a	I downloaded this because the picture reminded me of Jet Grind Radio. The game didn't so I uninstalled it.
3560	1	a	this game need ALOT, i mean alot of work on the lag and stutter issues which make this game almost unplayable at times, it is a good game but lag kills it.
378	1	a	Only real reason to play this game is the customization. Other then that, it's a broken piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ that has potential to be a real good game.
3392	1	a	this game is really fun and just a great game 
1436	1	a	240 hours and I finally got past the loading screen!
9694	0	a	Got stuck on how to close the social screen for 15 minutes. When i finished the tutorial i got renamed from 'AnalCombustion' to 'Fiery Cupcake' because of some violation. 0/10 â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game
5388	0	a	Looking for a newb friendly game? Well turn your head around and never look at this game. Unless you got some mates willing to help you out that are NOT newb players cause when a game got you struggling on the tutorial by yourself you won't be gettin far. But aye the game at least puts you right into the heat of things and the action. Why that was the most action packed 1.6 hour experience of my life....yay.
8481	0	a	DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME ONE OF THE WORST GAME EVER.  I JUST CANT PLAY THIS. BECUZ SERVER IS BLOW ALL THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING TIME
7496	0	a	the game stops responding when the game starts
3173	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME. NO KIDDING. see the hours... multiply that by 5 and u have my total overall
10870	1	a	Since the game was bought out by Kabam, it has become incresingly more about getting money rather than making the game more enjoyable. The game however is still VERY enjoyable IF you simply ignore the purchasable content, I would definitely recommend it.
2614	1	a	A Nice Open world GTA Style game. Just get it play and enjoy!
4516	0	a	IT DOESNT EVEN LET ME START UP THE GAME! When I start it up, it says I'm playing the game... for about 5 seconds, and then it just shuts down for no reason. And in that 5 seconds, the window for the game doesn't even show.
402	1	a	This is an awesome game. It's one of those games where you can always come back to, and feel welcome back when you do. I have over 500 well spent hours in the game, either raging, creating, whooping â¥â¥â¥, or just chilling with my online mates talking about the government or something stupid. There is a huge amount of freedom in the game. You start off with a car, gun, pistol, and one character mod. The start car also comes with a spawning becon, where you can spawn into a moving getaway car! Awesome right? It is a pay to win game though. Now with my amount of hours, you're probably thinking, I'm one of those payers? Well no, i wasnt all i baught was a car. But with practise, i started whooping â¥â¥â¥ big time, pay to win players where raging at me. There was only one character I was afraid of, but unfortunately i cannot remember her name. All i know, is if you want to practise your aiming ablity, dont go sniper first, go N-tec. Definately a gun where you can whoop â¥â¥â¥ with or without mods. You do need some processing power, pc and mind wise. Teamwork is key to beat anyone. Anyone with a good team, can beat a pay to win team.  A good strategy, and keep your eyes on the map. Avoid sprinting in close corners, you dont always have to right click aim, you can shoot from the hip, dont reload around enemys, switch to primary. Remember to always try flanking the oposing team. Shoot in small bursts, aka dont hold the trigger, constantly click it. It does help! I reccomend not having auto ready on, as some people need to get ammunition, different cars, see someone etc before a new mission. You dont have to mission for money, you can ramraid, or catch raiders.  If you need to know more, just ask me and dont uninstall EVER! Because i guarentee satifaction with the game. Its not easy to start off, but once your driving skills has increased. Reduction of lag, and you've gotten decent aim, or decent teamwork you will be loving it!  Always make sure you join a clan/guild on the game. The wurst thing about this game is playing alone. Always try to go with people who you know are like in missions so you always know the best thing to do in the mission for the win.   It's not about the kills, It's about winning, aka stealing kills, is fine! sounds like a dicky thing, but the better gamers are like more help the better!  I can't play the game anymore as i got my own pc now, and untill i get a motherboard that isnt made of stone, i wont be playing it, but untill then ill just be dreaming about coming back to this AWESOME GAME!!!!
5390	0	a	This is one classic EPIC Pay2Win game with crazy laggy server. If you want to get a nice stroke during playing with your PC, this game is definitly your first choice.
4566	0	a	Gosh, this game is completely f*cked up! Matchmaking is utterly bulls*it. From the very beginning you need to play with highlevel characters and donaters. Donate, f*ck, it's terrible. It's not just 'pay to buy something faster than the others' it's completely 10000% Pay2Kicka*s. Customization in this game is just wonderful. It is the one reason why you should play this game, else DON'T EVEN TRY IT.  AVOID THIS GAME AT ALL COSTS.
6174	0	a	Well, first of all... the game is great, the only problam is when I try to exit, and its a big problam. I have a computer with exactly the recommended system requierments but it still crashes... (blue screen /:)
10300	1	a	I found this game very easy to start and follow along. Free to play or Cost an â¥â¥â¥ load it has it all.
1315	1	a	This game is like GTA but a little bit friendlier
8039	0	a	I loved playing the game for the first few days until I discovered something by dumb curiosity. When the best equipment that is FAR FAR FAR superior to anything you can grind for exists as well as content that is almost needed to have purchased to keep playing at a sensible level, well....I can only recommend this is you enjoy spending a lot of money on a game. Besides that complaint, I can only say that development after beta was dissapointing, but the game is very very fun. I cannot argue with the idea that if the real money guns were available for a stupid amount of ingame currency, I would not be on any other game. But...pay to win. Best of luck out there!
2902	1	a	Fun game but when it comes to specs this things just loves to hog your computers power. It really needs to be optimized more and always have lag issues. That being said, it is a fun game espically if your a robber.
4294	0	a	It's â¥â¥â¥â¥.
1722	1	a	Besides the weird lag spikes this game is great!
1778	1	a	No cheaers at all. Best GM keep game clean. Very gut for new players learning to play...
3180	1	a	When you are playing alone you will suffer in agony so get a friend. Then you both can suffer.  10/10 best heroin simulator
4552	0	a	This. Is NOT one of the good ones. Beta was great, now its just full of P2W items and teamkilling â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Sure the reviews are ''mostly postive'' but aint nothin positive about this game.
5029	0	a	Had a lot of potential but Gamersfirst are one of the most money-hungry game developers I have ever seen. They never push out any significant updates to improve the game and instead release useless Armas items and recycled events. Performance is garbage, still no sign of the promised engine update after nearly 3 years. I wouldn't waste time playing the game in its current state, just another unbalanced piece of trash. :)
4467	0	a	Installed the game Make myself on 100 min (with bugs) Started playing A bug don't let me play (flashing screen all the time) Uninstalled the game Reinstalled the game Same â¥â¥â¥â¥ Uninstalled the game 0/10 Gave me epilepsy- IGN
7197	0	a	Wow this game is a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥. First of all, they don't even give you a tutorial so your just pushed into the game with no instructions what so ever. When you first get into the world, there isn't even a clear understanding on what to do. Do you go to the mailbox? Do you go to this place? You have no idea. Not only do you get no tutorial of any kind but you also are â¥â¥â¥â¥ed if your on your own. There's a reason this game died once, it was a giant pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥. Why try to polish â¥â¥â¥â¥ Reloaded?
8193	0	a	This game would have been fun but you have to download like 6 things and i still cant play. I cant delete it because it says its running when its not. If they cant fix all this download crap that you have to do and just keep is simple i would think about downloading it again.
4939	0	a	APB Reloaded. This game. I can't really think of a place to begin. This game is awful. Flat out pay-to-win noob destroying, mindlessly violent game. I was pretty enticed by the opening art. That is literally it. When I was put out into the world I was put up against unbalanced pros that absolutley destroyed the learning curve. This game is 100% pvp. No middle ground to get a feel for the game. And no legit training area. The training area is pvp. And of course can be invaded by pay-to-wins. This destroys the game. The story behind this game just seems more like an excuse for this game to exist than an actual game. The graphics are sub-par. Not bad but not great. The only thing that this game has going for it, is the over the top customization. I've always been a sucker for customization so that is how I discovered this little crapper. It also doesn't help that a good portion of customizations can either be aquired through hundreds of hours of devotion, or money. I know this is a F2P and thats to be expected but I cannot stand pay-to-win games. Especially if your game is nothing but pvp! What kind of horsecrap is that!? What were they thinking?? They did nothing to balance this garbage at all. They just give you a junk rifle and put you up against the pros during the tutuorial and wish you the best of luck. And the gunplay itself is dominated by snipers. As a game I give it 22/100
4592	0	a	this game got annoying just to download.some stuff i dont get why we need it.plus when i played it it got boring so fast
10332	0	a	Terrible Game, Terrible Systeam, Spent 38 minutes trying to Log In to the game and that is just â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up and this game should be removed from the Steam Store, its a waiste of Space its a waiste of everything... Its just a massive Scam
10206	1	a	I RECOMEND THIS GAME HIghly as soon as i played it i fell in love ;) 
3672	1	a	This game is openworld kind of game which give u the freedome to do anything. The game customazation of this game is really good which when u can customize ur character or ur own personal car in anytime u want. U can see my custimazation on my screenshot uploads and u will see how u can totally customize any thing in your own. The gameplay of the mission is good. U have to have teamwork so u can win the game. the game is third personshooter and use it to know where the ally or the enemies are. BIG THUMBS UP FOR THIS GAME!
5966	0	a	By the time I had aPC powerful enough to run this game, I briefly tried several times. I was never successful at having any fun playing it even when it did run.
3196	1	a	Let me start off with the word: 'wow...'  This game has stolen so much out of my time. But in the good way of course!  I have played APB: R for a COUNTLESS amount of hours. I met tons of nice people, that I eventually have become really good friends with outside the game.   The game has TONS of customization and replay value. The missions start getting repetitive, but the players and the gameplay of the different players make it so much different every time. I love it!  The game runs smoothly, but you do need a bit of a strong PC to play it. If you have problems over steam, I would suggest you to download the standalone from Gamersfirst themselves and add  APB Advanced Launcer  [forums.gamersfirst.com]  to it. It allows you with tons of more customization for your graphical settings than the game can give you. Props to the guy who made it!  Rounding up, 9/10. The game has its flaws, but I love the game with them. It wouldn't be the same fun without them! Cheers Gamersfirst for picking up a dead game and making it free to play! (the game died after a subscription model, but got brought up again)
5773	0	a	Game is terrible , I forgot what Ragequitting was until I played this game .Matchmaking is beyond broken ,the missions in this game are repititive and dumb as Sh*t(Vip Missions).This game gets updated frequently and yet 4 years later still running into the same problems.If 'Gamer'sFirst' Couldn't fix it 4 years back they sure as hell can't fix it now.   Bottom Line I DO NOT reccomend this game to anyone.
9838	0	a	i got the game and i wanted to make a acount on it and i did not use my email on it and it said i did 
6530	0	a	I have quite a lot of hours on this game i've played the game since 2010 when it belonged to the right people people that did want to make the game amazing and it was they did succeed but the down side is they went bank robed and sold the game to gamersfirst, Why is that bad you ask? Well simply. Gamersfirst are money sucking none carrying â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s bassicly, like EA just a much worse version of EA. Also the game is broken now so don't bother spending time on it.
6121	0	a	Didn't even work, and wants me to 'Like' their face-book page. I'm sorry that it might a good game and i am giving it a bad review, but it just doesnt work for me, Dont let this stop you from getting it though!
4510	0	a	do yourself a favor and dont play this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
2158	1	a	Its a pretty awesome game! It's a lot like GTA. Only issue is the steering on the cars... its hard to steer.
9201	1	a	The people who complain about the download times for this game must have pure dung beetle internet. It took less than 10 minutes for the whole game to download and in 10 minutes it's at 6% for updates...  10/10 would 10/10 will 10/10 did 10/10 waiting 10/10 dusty keyboard   Edit: 1hr and 10 minutes and it's at 49%. (In the last 3 minutes) Just jumped up to 74%. Now 100%.
5322	0	a	game wont let me drown myself :c  on a serious note i was doing the tutorial AND i accidently completed things without knowing what i was doing for one second.....0/10 â¥â¥â¥ and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s not worth it
1391	1	a	this game is pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥ to say straight up its gay guys gayst possablie it sucks pooooooooooo
7437	0	a	Tried it for a wekend. Incredibly dull. Not recommended.
7082	0	a	Very bad, I can't even play the game. It takes like an hour to load and after that, it crashes. Unless anyone has a solution to this problem, I can't come up with a great review for this game.  1/10
4645	0	a	I thought I would give this game another try right. thinking it can't be that bad right? well with in 10mins of gameplay I remembered why I stopped in the first place. This game is total â¥â¥â¥â¥, I think I'll just wait for GTA V.
700	1	a	it says it requires very little but my pc has better then that and still has pretty bad frames but in gernerality It is very adicting and fun
9182	1	a	I really saw potential in the gameplay. The first mission before you go open world was very interesting but the screen is just so messy in terms of menus and stuff. It annoyed me. But if you can look past that then you might find it pretty good
9160	1	a	Its an okay game once you figure out what you're doing.
304	1	a	It's nice game!
4151	0	a	Bold and brash? More like, belongs in the trash.
10331	1	a	Very good game if you like walking through destroyed cities, scavenging and looking on radioactivenes mutants.
6430	0	a	The game used to be good but now its another pay to win game.
2753	1	a	this is a great game,but i think u should have a X64 computer to run it well,because it needs 4GB RAM at least
3510	1	a	RON IS â¥â¥â¥â¥
10189	1	a	Ever play Fallout and wish it were multiplayer? Then Fallen Earth is for you. Excellent atmosphere for role playing and definitely has a bit of a learning curve on the crafting system. Huge map and tons to explore. Extremely helpful, loyal community for an old game. Not one of those games you play through in a few hours. Getting bored? Stop and come back to it anytime. Absolutely recommend you donât skip the tutorial. 
74	1	a	THE BEST GAME IN THE WORLD 
9967	1	a	This MMO is, well almost identical to others like most are. And honestly i don't mind. I like these kinds of games more than enough to play them, especially if they're set in a universe or atmosphere that I am enjoying (a great example being SWTOR or KOTOR because I am a huge Star Wars fan). But one thing i like about this, and this is similar to Destiny (which i also loved), is how it combines your tipical MMO with a first and third person shooter stile, more tradisional in big AAA games like Call of Duty, Battlefiel, etc. This means as well as these MMO's were you running around leveling up and colectiong loot you also get the FPS experiance were you get to aim a gun at your foe and blast in to bits rather than pressing 1, waiting for your ability to charge and pressing 1 again, then waiting for your ability to charge and pressing 1 again, and so forth. And if you dont like that, if you prefere this method of spamming 1, then you probably wont like this game unless there is some way to change that (which i don't think there is). It is set in a large apocalyptic landscape were you can join and hunt factions, use scavanging and mining or brutaly murder NPC's to gain money, play competative pvp or i assume clan wars. Or you can go out and be a d*ck to other players, by killing them on sight just for the fun of it (I won't judge you... unless you kill ME). But i just love it when games combine elements of these two game types and i think it works really well. BUT i have not been playing for long and this review could RAPIDLY change from thumbs up, to thumbs down, as i play this games more, and learn this games back-to-front. Signing out.
4852	0	a	gets boring, same routine and items. pay to get new items.
6125	0	a	shity game
6227	0	a	its not good about driving a car.please fix it 
9575	0	a	This has a whole lot of nothing. So much empty space. its just so boring.
6776	0	a	Whoop de doo. I played this game before it came to steam, but I couldn't write a review because I hadn't played it on steam. Great.  So I installed it, started it up, shut it down and uninstalled it.  That's right, I never went to actually play it here in steam. Why? Because, if it's only half as bad as I remember, then you want to stay far away from this game.  Bad matchmaking, elitst jerks, hackers, money hungry developers, and much more. The company making it calls themselves ''gamersfirst''  ... Don't get me started. but hey, if you're filthy rich and don't know what to spend all your money on. This game is it.  I won't bother telling anything else, everyone who's given this game a thumbs down is summing it up pretty nicely.  It's too bad, really. I loved the concept, and I always enjoy character customizations with few limits. 
4877	0	a	The system requirements are insane, and even on a decent system it will lag and sometimes crash.   Also the last time I played (2012) it really was pay to win. Any decent weapon you would only unlock for a couple days before it re-lock itself, and you wouldn't make enough money to keep up with it. Then you'd go on some mission and a guy who spent a bunch of money would just 1 shot you with a rocket launcher while you had your starting pistol and nothing else. I hope they improved this since then, but it left a really bad taste in my mouth.  Overall it has a lot of potential and the world is chaotic and fun, but the points above make me not want to go back.
5895	0	a	it does nt work its junk waste of time 
2243	1	a	Nice game
3399	1	a	My thing wont update so i cant play!?
7257	0	a	Game Status Long Ago: Very Playable, Good Latency  Game Status Now: Unplayable, Horrible Latency   The Latency beats over all the customization with nearly 1000 latency playing normal.  The game is just unplayable now.
6338	0	a	10/10 Would not play again.
7589	0	a	This game dont work :( 
6883	0	a	The Unbearable lag renders what should be an amazing game unplayable. Tragic.
3602	1	a	I really don't have much to say since I didn't get pass the loading screen
1107	1	a	Long download time.
10090	1	a	fun and addicting but the atv should go faster
6220	0	a	Bad, bad optimization and totally P2W. The idea itself is not bad, but not original too. Hope some new updates fix the way too high system requirements.  2/10
6936	0	a	This game is a pay to win ClusterFork.  It's not enjoyable, and in no means can I recommend it to you and feel good about doing so.  In my opinion, I'd say avoid this game, it's not worth the time.
6296	0	a	Quite literally the worst game ive played. The best part was when i uninstalled it. If you want pay2win simulator here you go. If you dont, then dont touch this thing they call a game.
2898	1	a	Awesome, high quality &amp; freedom. Those 3 titles speak for themselves.
9671	1	a	Fallout 3 Online.
7077	0	a	cant even play â¥â¥â¥â¥ game
10716	1	a	The community sucks â¥â¥â¥, but the new dev team seems promising. This game WILL suck in your time. Be warned! :D
1031	1	a	Great game overall, excellent graphics and animations. The customization alone has no equal in the MMO gaming world as far as I'm aware. Combine that with a broad selection of weapons, upgrades, skills and other features and you got yourself a top notch game. Its even free to play, what more could you ask for? Well for one its pay to win and if you're not paying they're constantly showing you how much you're missing out on for not giving them money. Do or don't its up to you as it doesn't really add much to the game.  TL;DR  Pros -Good Graphics -Good Character design -Good combat -â¥â¥â¥â¥ing good everything   Cons -They really really want your â¥â¥â¥â¥ing money -Like really want it -Want it so bad that the guy who gave them 20 dollars has a gun that kills you in two shots bad -like srs   If you can get past that â¥â¥â¥â¥ then the game is really fun, overall I recommend it.
5129	0	a	Won't load for me.
7004	0	a	Doesn't even launch. Waste of space.
9374	1	a	Game has changed a lot, but the old versions used to be really fun and immersive. It's a lot more modernized(microtransactions, pay2win), but is still enjoyable as it has a spark of what it used to be
1590	1	a	A lot of cons in this game, A LOT. i hate it, but i still want to play it   9/10
7018	0	a	This whole playtime it was just me trying to open the game and log in. Created two accounts and it would still not let me log in, I stated my real age which is 18 but apperantly I'm too young to play the game. The game does not close nor open normally and you cannot alt+tab while in any part of the game. The in-game logos at the start are un-skipable and it's just completely a mess...
253	1	a	I haven't seen any toxic players yet because i have only played 2 hours xD the game is pretty bad optimized and servers are laggy but its still fun
7843	0	a	The gameplay itself can be summed up as a pretty-looking timesink: It does a good job of drawing you in, but between large loading times and rather grindy gameplay it struggles to keep you there.  But I've found myself spending hours just dicking around with the various character/outfit/vehicle/logo customisation editors (and there is a LOT of customisation you can do in this game), so there's that I guess.
8234	0	a	I spent 30 minutes downloading the launcher, and 20 minutes downloading the game. Then, another 5 for DirectX. I click start, and a page pops up on Chrome, and the game isn't there.  10/10 would waste time again.  EDIT: I finally got the game up, and it wants me to make an account. Why? Why should I? I don't see why people make you sign up for a game you downloaded through Steam.
9928	1	a	To put this game simple here are the pros and cons  Pros -The crafting systm is unique and refreshes your gameplay experince giving you better gameplay  -The game is open world giving you many places to travel -The looting system is common and easy to understand -The enemys in the game are unique from other characters you will see in games -The game is free to play -The game is not pay to win  Cons -The graphics are not the best -The game makes alot of people lag even with a good running system -The game has alot of bugs and when the server has to do maintenence it will take it awhile -The NPC seem dead they dont talk much -The Combat in the game is not the funniest thing you will do -The hud is all over the screen  Overall Graphics-5/10 Gameplay-7/10   So out of 20 i gave it a 12 but if you like free then this is your game    
5059	0	a	it wont load up -_- 
5985	0	a	bad just bad 2/10 would not bang
7498	0	a	Populated with 12 year olds and pay to win. Don't even bother.
6996	0	a	To be honest, if you wanna enjoy this game be prepared to spend at least 300 dollars more on it. The average is 1500 dollars.  Enjoy your pay to win free to play game.
5047	0	a	this game in my opinion is terrible, yes it may have good customization but down to the fighting, and driving. It feels like im driving a noodle with wheels. and the guns sound like a hammer hitting the wall, i would not recomend this game to any one, unless they are looking for a social game!
7189	0	a	You want to have fun in a good,bugless, multiplayer sandbox? buy GTA V
1956	1	a	An OK game...Not all that impressive because of P2W items and extremely unbalanced matchmaking. The best thing is well, it's free to play you don't have to pay so that's a plus. You could always just hijack store stuff and keep it as low under 2,000 otherwise cops will bust you. Pretty easy money too. Mission I'd probably not play those without having a really good team on your side because most of time they just don't stick together or stick to enemy side instead of your side. Sometimes stupid people too. Some moments you're good at most part, some other moments you will probably most likely to get annoyed, maybe even â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ because they have a better weapon than you do and they're higher level than you, richer also and there's many veterans that will probably wonder wtf you're doing in a game when you're new. Another issue is Steam WILL glitch implying you are playing a game of APB Reloaded when you quit the game and you have to force shut it down with a Task Manager. I can clearly see why people want this game dead already. P2W ruins it mainly because of OP grenade launcher that practically kill you in 1-2 hits. Some people just claims you hack yet you don't. GG. 3.4 out of 5. Leaning between yes and no on game recommendation, 50/50 neutrality depending on how this game is...
5789	0	a	GAME IS JUST WAY TO OVERRATED .JUST A CRAPY EXAMPLE OF COMPANYS FAILS TO CREATE SOMTHING NEW RATHER THAN TRING TO MAKE IT ANOTHER GTA UNISTALL THIS GAME WHILE YOU CAN IT WILL SAVE YOU TIME AND SPACE WELL IF YOU DONT CHEW BIG RED THEN â¥â¥â¥â¥ YOU..LOL
3532	1	a	Is it dead yet?
8755	0	a	my older brother used to play this game ah back in the good times but eventually i got convinced to trying it immediatly i noticed it has the same frames and 10 minute loading screens from gta only the graphics are from 2006...... i wondered to myself why dont i just play gta but then i noticed the games paytowin right on the announcments theres some small sale on the paytowin â¥â¥â¥â¥ pretty dumb some reason i have friends that actually enjoy this â¥â¥â¥â¥ i dont id rather just play gta now why the â¥â¥â¥â¥ are you reading this review be productive and have positive vibes man
3062	1	a	The best online game ever. You must play it if you like GTA IV or Saints Row etc. Very good game, and finally its free to play. EVERYONE MUST PLAY THIS KICKASS GAME
24	1	a	APB is loaded with kids calling others children 'kids' Ù©(à¹Ì¯Í¡à¹)Û¶   They are usually around puberty, and hormonal disorders hit them really hard: Drama, Attitude, Disrespect, Aggressivity, Sass, Egocentrism.
10784	1	a	Awesome and addicting game. Really requires you to concentrate and improve yourself. It might feel like tough at first, but it will get easier. Learning curve can be cruel for newcomers, but there are plenty of people to give tips and helpful community!
1572	1	a	I CANT GET THE LAUNCHER TO UPDATE IT WORKED FINE YESTERDAY NOW ITS MESSED UP
7825	0	a	Can't play this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ game for more than 2 minutes without it â¥â¥â¥â¥ing crashing. DO NOT DOWNLOAD. Waste of my â¥â¥â¥â¥ing time and PC space.
4648	0	a	Like every 'Free to Play' Game out there, today. You get a bunch of fedora sporting, neckbearded fat â¥â¥â¥â¥s and spoiled kids spending their mommy's money or their benefits checks on overpowered â¥â¥â¥â¥ for their characters. Just as soon as you start playing, you're constantly â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ in every direction by unbalanced weapons and rockets and all you get is a two inch â¥â¥â¥â¥ of a weapon that does nothing. The cars control like you're on ice, even when those cars look like they're your typical front-wheel drive rice burner from Fast and the Furious or an All Wheel Drive supercar. If you want a game that you can play for free, don't waste your time and save your money on a better game. Seeing games like this is no wonder that they get bombarded by hackers and trainers.
357	1	a	This game is sooo close to what i can find an open world, trird person shooter, car jacking, and most of all custimization gotta love that. This game is clsoe to me having gta V, so what am i gonna do?  -Download  -think of the things i can do while it downloads  -when finsihes get hyped  -and play
10319	1	a	Kind of boring to be honest. It's alright though, feels like Fallout online. If you like fallout and mmo's then you shoudl try it out.
978	1	a	Take me down, to the San Paro city, where the noobz are green and teh hacks are pretty.
7766	0	a	Money Grubbing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s that don't care about updating the game to make the lag spikes go away, No they would just rather take your money and give you the middle finger. XD I'm glad my friends know how to hack the game so's to get all the perks they want .I.
6718	0	a	ruined game/10     it's not   Ghosts   .... I mean this is worst than Ghosts     And that is sayin somthin
6788	0	a	For some reason one day i joined and i kept disconnecting after 5 sec of the game,someone fix it cause i would really like to go back to the game with my teamates
887	1	a	6/10, This Game Is Easy To Pick Up And Play. But to have some Luck, you need to Devote.  So many of you may already know of this game like me, But this games i gave a 6/10 because the gameplay, the customisation, all of that. Strip it away for a second and see how the game is built. ARMAS - Providing Players with the option to buff their Chars/Accounts with weapons and cars. PREMIUM - Allows Players to futher their customisation and earn more money from missions. Those two are the biggies that get me down. Because i love the customisation that those 2 allow me to expand in and yes i do get that they need money somehow but whenever i log on i think about Patches. A patch where we can trade JT or $ For G1C (GamerfirstCredits.) So overall i have a fun time in the game and it's exactly why I've got almost 150 hours into the game.  If Yu Wanna Play with Me I Will Either Be on Enforcer - OfficerBanshee Criminal - Quanzy Don't ask me where I got my names from. LONG STORY _________________  Mr. Retro Signing Off - I Reccomend this if you are willing to put hours upon end into this game ;)

8128	0	a	This game used to be one of my favorite games of all time. I've spent hundreds of hours playing, but lately the developers seem to be milking the players for all they're worth. They release new 'legendary' guns almost monthly, which can only be won with a 1% chance by opening Joker Mystery Boxes (They cost $1 a pop).   Also, their balance team doesn't seem to know how to properly balance the in-game weapons. At the time of writing, they are trying to balance them by introducing some wonky recoil mechanics on all of their guns it seems. The servers are absolute trash and you'll notice, even with the new servers, constant stuttering or warping, and mind you I play on a rather great PC.  The community has absolutely no regulation. There are no GMs patrolling the districts so you can expect a lot of foul language, hate speech, harassment and angry whisper messages from other players. With the exception of new guns or cars (AKA Cash Grabs), there has been no new content added to the game since the game's inception in 2008. There are only two playable districts and a couple of fight clubs and that is all you'll ever see in this game are these maps.  I can not recommend this game in good faith. Hopefully things change drastically, but I doubt that will happen with the way the current developers and team are handling this game.
5147	0	a	This game is alright. in my eyes i wouldnt play it 10 hours a day every day. this game is highly pay to win, and you dont get a lot for what you pay for. so many hackers in this game it isnt even funny. but all in all it is a great time waster. i just wouldnt recommend this game to people to want a fun game..
8361	0	a	Customization in this game is incredible, sadly hackers have destroyed any will to play. Was one of my favorite shooters.
7182	0	a	If you don't spend money you wont have a chance
5040	0	a	One word: Matchmaking.
4534	0	a	This game is worse than â¥â¥â¥â¥ing cancer...
1164	1	a	Absolute awful excuse for a game. Huge disadvantage set against beginners as max rank players are still able to play against them. AI is simply dreadful and driving any car is a monumental task. 0/10 would deffo not play again
9802	0	a	I played it. Got renamed to a ridiculous name because my name offended the you know who. Then the same mod who had renamed me popped up in main chat to ask people to keep the discussion to game related Q&amp;A. I wasnt even chatting at the time, and the people who were were simply chit chatting. Apparently this is too much for this concentration camp of a game. No fun allowed. Only talk about the game.  I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hate this â¥â¥â¥â¥. Burn down every game company that manages its users like stupid cattle. God forbid giving personal details or talking about fun stuff. It might create you know, DISCUSSION. We dont want that. We want stupid morons who only talk about the game and pay their dues. Die. Eat it and die.
3715	1	a	is this old? plz tell
6794	0	a	Horrible laggy and hard to set controls for motionjoy the regular is ok but need some work
9757	1	a	This Is The Best Story Ever!!!!!
660	1	a	This game is sooo like gta 5 and the graphics are good and theres all different guns 2 choose :) 
8140	0	a	I want to like this game. It has the potential to be fun. It's mechanics are great. The idea behind it amazing. But alas, it lacks the one thing any PVP game requires: Balance. It advertises a tutorial server that doesn't exist, so you're tossed into the thick of things to learn the game. It doesn't tell you controls, mission types, or anything of the sort, and the worst of it all is the utter lack of balance. A fresh off the boat character will be matched against gold level players wielding rocket launchers and LMG's that may as well be classified as ranged chainsaws. It's not newbie friendly at all, and it doesn't give you a chance to learn the game before putting you against people who live and breath the game. I can't recommend this, as much as I want to enjoy it.
50	1	a	Figure its time for an update, I started playing apb about 2 years ago and in that time have put in around 4000 hours of gameplay. I really do enjoy this game and I feel people deserve an unbiased opinion before trying it out. So I present both positive and negative points here.   First lets talk about hackers, everybody says hackers this hackerst that. No. period. Yes like any online game there is hackers, lets take any given day though, I do around 25-40 missions on any given day, maybe one or two of those missions will have a hacker in them. In fight club its a bit different, there is no missions its just the same stuff over and over kinda an easy place to farm kills close quarters and stuff so hackers go in there and use an aimbot but again thats not an all the time thing its just something that happens because hey its an online game.   Next lets talk about 'Pay 2 Win' some don't know the actual meaning of that phrase so im going to explain, P2W means that you can pay cash money for an instant advantage over others in game. Now to some extent I guess you could say its pay to win in that manner, the actual cash shop 'Armas Marketplace' has various things, cars, guns, etc. The difference is you can buy them account bound, say you buy a 3 slot gun (slots being open for modifications that change guns ie: mag pull allows you to reload faster at the cost of a set ammount of ammo being short from the clip, where as extended mags has more ammo to a clip but takes longer to reload. They are unlocked in game and cant be used until you hit rank 40 which takes about a day or two) and you got it account bound, well you could have this gun with 3 slots on it on a new character, but that doesnt change much, all guns that you can get from armas marketplace are either reskins (same mechanics as the normal gun just different look and sound ultimately feeling different but having no advantage over the original gun) of the guns in game or they are available to buy with joker tickets which can be earned by doing daily activities and playing in fight club. Or you could buy a car, say you play as a criminal but you want a car from the enforcer faction such as the Jericho, you can buy that on armas with 4 slots and drive it on your criminal. There is also clothing packs/items and weapon skins/camos available but none of this changes the base of the game, however the game does have premium on armas marketplace as well which all that does is give a substantial increase to money and exp gain as well as allow you to have up to i think 100 symbols per item (not sure i dont customize often) set your clan name as a title so people can see it easier, and lowers the cool down on your active character mod by one minute. I personally have around 2,000$ (two thousand) in my account because its what i enjoy so I support them and will continue to. I have i think 35-40 account bound guns, most of the clothing packs, key to the world, key to the city, and almost every car as a 4 slot through armas on my main character.   Moving on, next topic, the game engine is currently unreal engine 2 but they have been working on a new engine for a few years and it is almost ready for release, read into it more on the forums and blog posts.   Customization, its a big deal in apb and I have honestly never seen another game with such an in depth character customization.   Im honestly too lazy to continue this review and would rather just go play the game instead of talking about it, however if you have any questions feel free to add me and ask, or even watch my steam broadcast im playing 70% of the time.

8431	0	a	LOTS OF SCAMMERS. 0/10 would never play APB again
9143	0	a	Fallen Earth is the story of a really awesome idea getting destroyed by poor presentation, horrible gameplay, and just making a great example an how not to make a MMORPG. The story is sort of simple, you are a clone and stuff happened and then other stuff happened and now you are in the open (after a 20 min tutorial). I'm being for real I didn't know what was going on the entire time. The dialouge is horrendous which becomes a problem since thats how you get both important information and quests. Even though it's free it's not worth your time.
1130	1	a	this is intsalled but i have yet to play it...
7474	0	a	I so dont like it, its boring and horrible your better of Playing 8BitMMO
6980	0	a	You know the idea of this is great and all, but the fact that it is a pay-to-win game is still completely real. Would I ever play this again? No, but if the devs of this decided to make a singleplayer campange(cant spell) of this game with optional co-op I would love this game but until then I will stay back and watch what happens. Do I recommend this game? No, but if you have lots of money to burn on a game go ahead. Even though i have a low playtime, I am aware of this pay-to-win stature because of when i went to customixe the starter vehicle, it said 'You have too many stickers(lol wut i forgot what they were),please delete some before finishing.' The. Car. Started. Above. The. Non. Premium. Limit. I Was like UH NO THX ILL PASS. I basicly turned a great new ar bak to its original state cause PREMIUM HAVE INFINITE STICKERS BUT I DNT.
9606	1	a	PLAY THIS GAME WITH ME CAUSE I WILL GUIDE YOU TO PLAY LIKE A PRO
10151	1	a	played this game for years now the devs never give new content or fix old bugs pure lazy dev team but for a frre to play game its one of best out there just dont hit max level to fast or bordom will follow
10202	1	a	This game is all ive wanted in a open world game. its huge and stratigic and ive never had a game experiance like this. id get this game instead of fallout hands down. it blows all other games of its kind out of the water
6405	0	a	I didnt even played it. I cant start it ... some error with launcher like its pirated, and i downloaded it over steam. JUST DONT INSTALL IT â¥â¥â¥â¥ING GARBAGE
3506	1	a	It's fun if you play with friends and want to get cancer sheerly based on the community.
9288	1	a	Apparently I played this for .3 hours some time in the past. I do not remember this. So either something's wrong with Steam, or this game has nothing worth remembering.  I don't even remember how I got to the store page to see that I was able to write this 'review'. WHAT IS THIS SORCERY?  Recommended because possible timewarp/10.
2801	1	a	I enjoy the join friends factor of this game. Being able to group up with friends and go out on a mission of chaos as either a criminal or a law enforcer is completely fun at times. The game itself can be challenging unless you like games where you can kill others and just cause utter mindless destruction. I also like the options of gaining different clothing, guns, vechiles and such for doing missions. And if you are especially creative, you can make emblems and designs for clothing, vehicles and sell them on the marketplace to other players for in game money.
2422	1	a	Fun game, like a cheap/ low budget version of GTA.
5950	0	a	At first I didn't read the below comments to make sure I was unbiased when trying out this game. But then I realized how fun and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game is at the same time. Furthermore I hated the sheer verticalality of some weapon tiers in combat scenarios. In the end, after getting stomped by gold threat players with weapons that were far superior than the no-mod , non-arma - defualt weapon, I just gave up.   Fun game. But overall a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥.  The guns that aren't immediately available to new players take a alot of time and effort to grind. The same guns also would've made the experience for a new player more tolerable if they had the same firepower than many cash-cows were throwing into the game. This stratification of gear implied by contractor levels and real-money spent make a new player's experience hell. The fact that you can easily bypass the contract level purchase requirements though the ARMA store to access even better versions of the same weapon you grind for is only a hint of pay to win, in the fact that you can just straight up buy the best weapons for every combat scenario.  Missions are Repetitive, and more often than not an Defensive team will be almost impenetrable. Even though an offending team can split up and flank, the defending team has less area to cover and thus has multiple lines of sight to each other and to the invading team as well.  Cash Shop is very expensive. $5+ dollars for a 30 day rental, 25 dollars for a permanent weapon. Don't even begin on the cars. The quaity of your car lends itself to how troll you can be when you decide to take a package holdout mission and you drive around with said package.  Even BLR has a permanent weapon purchase mechanic, and that game has it's own share of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥ problems.  In hindsight, don't play this game unless you have tons of cash to throw around for OP guns and fast cars. One of the most expensive f2p games I've ever seen.
1772	1	a	I like the game but it has a lot of bug that needed to be fixed!
7047	0	a	This game is very unique and has a truckload of potential. I've played on and off for a couple years now (although only a couple hours through steam) and this is what I have to say: Pros: -Unique (more or less) Concept -High Potential -Graphics are pretty good -Decent amount of features for both sides (criminal and enforcer) -Some of the best and most in depth character customization I've seen (rivals the sims [almost]) Cons: -Published by Gamers First -Laggy -Graphics while pleasing are buggy -AI is buggy -Takes pay to win to a whole new level -No plot at all -No matchmaking at all -Other players can be a nuisance at times -Steep learning curve
1408	1	a	A silly game that is limited to your creative.. and the sandbox missions. In reality this game beckons you to enjoy it and yourself. It's definitely a game that you want to sink your teeth in with friends, duke it out on the internet for a couple of hours and do it again and again! The game however much awesome it produces it's limited in a sense and to some this game might not meet their criteria of playable and 'fun' to a certain extent. If you're into goofy sandbox games that will have you laughing, screaming, crying, even vommitting at your screen, this is the game for you.  3/5 would bang.
9112	1	a	Finding this oddly addicting,  looking forward to future development 
10134	1	a	Only have about 6 or so hours into this game but so far, I'm loving it. For the price, you can't get much better. In reading the other reviews before getting this game, I saw a lot of mention of this being the 'poor man's Fallout' game. Being a huge fan of the Fallout franchise, I find this to be mostly accurate, but it doesn't live up the the actual play of this game. It has a lot of what made the Fallout series great, and expands on what Fallout could have been, had it been made into a MMO. It also seems to be much more detailed when it comes to the scavenging and character building aspects. For what it is, I really couldn't ask for more. Once I get another 20 or 30 hours in, I will revisit this reveiw with a little more info and detail.

490	1	a	I would strongly reccomend this game for anyone who ever happened to play any of GTA games and liked it, but felt it lacks action and multiplayer, because that's exactly what this games has to offer. In this game you can choose to play either as a criminal or as an officer. It has an extremly long and hard leveling system that will keep you busy and has to offer a lot of vehicles, weapons and even clothes. More of than, it has almost unlimited customisation options for everything, starting from graffity and finishing with customisation of your personel vehicle.   Feel like it's time to take a break from your usial calm games and kick some â¥â¥â¥? Than what are you waiting for? Download it and go for it!
1732	1	a	It's fun. So much. But it sucks, i told you.
682	1	a	Gonna love how all the idiots say this is P2W. It is HARD to understand that the paid weapons are just RESKINS of the normal weapons? It even says so in their â¥â¥â¥â¥ing description and on the wiki. Everyone just comes and reviews after 20hrs not getting â¥â¥â¥â¥ about this game. Funny.  This game is GOOD. It is fun, and brings tons of activites you can do solo or with friends. In terms of PvP, you need strong nerves to play it. If you get slightly frustrated by stupidities outside this game, you will not enjoy APB.   Thanks for downvoting my review, but after hitting that thumb down button go check the wiki for the so-called 'paid-weapons' you are so much crying about.

2771	1	a	Great Game and Free i think u would enjoy :D!!!
3777	0	a	As you can see I played this game for quite a while, thouh I can not recommend anyone to try it out. I played this game with a very casual attitude but over time it becomes less and less fun for several reasons  The biggest reason of this is a mixture of bad game design and the community. Often enough you just see players abusing every aspect of the game to get an advantage. Some of them can be very hostile and unfriendly as well.  The biggest problem in terms of the game itself is the matchmaking. People are seperated into 4 different threat Levels, Gold, Silver, Bronze and Green. There are several instances for each threat level to play in. Each threat level is allowed to go into instances one level below their own level which results in the fact that Gold instances are almost always empty, becasue all gold players decide to go to the silver instances.   The distribution of threat levels is set so that the top 20% of players are given the gold status, but becasue inactive accounts aren't taken out of the equation (which means that every silver that quits this game out of frustration is still counted towards the silver group) it rather feels like 70% of people are gold, menaning the being a gold status is easy to achieve.  This results in the fact that average and casual players that turn gold are deemed to play against the super pros in this game a lot of times, giving them an experience of this game that is not fun at all. I might seem to you like a good player when you look at the time I played, but I was mostly on the border between silver and gold, meaning that as long as I play in silver instances I have to play a lot against people I don't stand much chances against. Since it is not that obvious for new silver players how enter a bronze instance they will most likely end up being put in the silver districts as well and end up being farmed a lot.  With this game being free to play there's not much wrong with giving it a try, but don't expect too much of a pleasant experience. I seems like a game with a lot of potential, but doesn't live up to much of it.

1997	1	a	This is a vary versitile game that can be both fast paced and slow paced at times. The servers are always being worked on which can at time have a negative effect on the gameplay but they never last so long that it becomes an issue for groups. The in-game features are fantastic and G1 is always releaseing new content for purchase.  This game is very graphically demanding and I would recommend making sure that your PC meets the recomended specs before even thinking about dowloading this game. I run an i7 3770k with a 2BG GTX 660 and I get around 100fps. So make sure that you have good gear in your PC.  I very much recommend this game. It's in third-person which is always a nice change to the normal first person shooter games out there. Very fun with friends and I hope they can continue to develop more content for this amazing game. Get it!

10503	0	a	Very dissapointed.. played the game like a year ago.. bought char slots, chests &amp; leveled/geared/unlocked several chars back then.. was really fun  now I see, that the game got some updates and I was getting excited again until i logged in: All chars/bought chests+bought char slots are resetted/removed again (I'd really like to know how they can remove something I actually paid money for?) and of course all chars are resetted... all I saw was a very big pop-up about a pundle that inlcluded char slots/chests etc (kinda all the things I already bought 1 year ago already).. so yeah.. greed took over here.. stay away.. rotmg RIP..
7606	0	a	This game is more then just pay to win, it's pay to play. Your cash rewards, experience, and so forth are all dramatically reduced if you don't buy their VIP. It's not just that though, they refuse to make any new guns that you can actually unlock in the game. Every new gun is one you have to pay for! Not a single new gun has been released to public aviablilty since the restart of the actual game from APB, All Points Bulletin. If that doesn't make it bad enough, to truely enjoy yourself in the game you need to be a VIP. Why? Better and longer trials for weapons and cars, not to mention the ability to customize yourself and vehicle, emblems, and more to higher extents. The only game worse then this with a worse pay to win system is WarZ now known as 'Infestation Stores.' It is though fun to play once you're a high enough level, hackers are dealt with much easier now because of the anti-hack system known as Fair Fight was installed. There's without a doubt of equalization in weapons, but that equalization is in the ones you pay for. The graphics aren't bad, controls, mechanics, and interest isn't bad at all actually. From climbing ladders to driving off ramps from unfinished highways, civilians actively moving about the map to simply running over criminals or enforcers to catching criminals in acts of crime. There's a lot of innovation, tons of little areas to be found even when you think you know all the maps and secret locations. I can honestly say if it wasn't for the pay to win system this would be without a doubt the greatest game ever made. It's like Grand Theft Auto 4 and Need For Speed: Most Wanted (the original for Xbox 360.) You can steal a civilan car for the lulz of it, or make your own from a fairly wide range of choices and if you decide to dump cash into this game that customization can truely be starstriking. I've never seen a game with more customization options in my life. If this game allowed you to unlock everything over time it'd be an absolute reccommendation, but it not only doesn't try to do this but HEAVILY avoids it. Potential never met.  Did I mention they made it so you have to buy upgrades for your friend and ignore list, or that new content is never given to those who don't pay...?
3948	0	a	Horrendous player community that puts Dota and CounterStrike to shame if you're lower than 100+ ranks you're likely to get kicked from a lot of parties instantly, rampant with cheaters and pay2win real money store weapons, cars handle like boats on ice, the servers are Laggy with huge ping spikes regularly with little to no moderation, the game is poorly optimized leading to giant frame drops and a hugely outdated Unreal engine.  Uses punkbuster of all programs too as it's anti-cheat so expect to get banned for having windows volume mixer open while genuine cheaters laugh their way to free wins in every match undetected.

7143	0	a	Doesn't f****ing work on some Laptops, PC's and Mac's. Espically my Laptop. Reloaded Games fix this, or steam fix this. ITS SO ANNOYING!
4397	0	a	This games all good but the problem is its a big game and u need a good graphic, some bugs and hacker on this game.
9466	1	a	After having a little experience on this I can say that this is possibly the greatest Free to Play i've ever came across, the world is relatively big and the whole gameplay is intense!
9471	0	a	Downloaded off of steam, made account at whatever website it redirected me to, website only used my email and password. The game itself is asking for a username, but I've never been given an option to make a username, and when I go to make a new account it brings me to the same crap where it only uses my email. Can't figure this out, I'm probably just autistic. Still very dissatisfied that this whole sign in thing was very poorly designed, if I can get helped with this or get it fixed if this is a legit problem, I'll write another review when it actually lets me play the game.
4701	0	a	I love APB, but the game managers doesn't even care about their customers.
8204	0	a	Really boring and generic
8604	0	a	Honestly I would not reommend this game. When you start its quite fun doing missions and stuff but after sometime you get bored and realize all the missions are the same none of them are different. Well of course they are diffrent but very similar. The customization is great i hav had alot of fun with that but money is needed and getting it is very boring i mostly just played the game to custmoize my charater but after an hour of customizing i realzie i dont hav enough money lol.and its very anoying it is highly possible to be walking around then you would get shot with a rocket launcher or when hackers join and kill everyone also another thing is that the maps are incredibly small which also makes it even more boring. So i really wouldnt recommend this game to others.  The only way i would recommed this game is if they:  1) improve and expand map size 2) Add diverse and new longer missions 3) remove hackers 4) add more ways to make money 5) improve or redsign vehicle physics (or the traction and torque and thoes tins) 6) add first person. 7) improve AI 8) add aircrafts? (only if the map size is increased) 9) add more attachments to weaponry and make weapons customizable. :)
10564	1	a	I have been playing this game for four years now. ( I have more hours logged than it shows because I play on Flash projector now ) I've logged probably around 2000 hours. The game is A ton of fun. But it is slowly and sadly dying because no devs work on the game anymore. I just hope they put a dev or two on the game, or sell it to someone who will. Long live rotmg. Get the game, try it out. It's enjoyable. 
8194	0	a	It's a game that you play a whole lot for a weekend then never go back to it.

4578	0	a	Hmmm What can i say about APB Reloaded... Well The game is great if there wasent so much hacking lag and general No â¥â¥â¥â¥ Given when it comes to the developers.... They just dont care about the people or game... This game is only for and ever will be for people who pay to win .... Hackers who ptw will Never get banned becuase unless uve payed more then him or have more people who ptw report him nothing will get done.. Free to play people have no pull in the game...Its terrible some of the ptw weapons being super op.. Its just an unfit game for anyone who doesnt want to spent 50+ dollars to win and troll people  2/10 f%*king Disgracefull  Gamers first my â¥â¥â¥ more like Bank account First   UPDATE: 4/10/14  Well im done with this game 150+ hours and im a decent player but its just too terrible, Ive incounterd so many hackers and Such op weapons this game isnt fun anymore Those of you who ever play F.ree T.o P.lay games Please check if its by Gamers First.  Games go to Gamers First to die slowly  Just dont play any games by these people do yourself a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Favor and Dont get frustrated
10417	1	a	Uninstall button works... So that's a plus.  Seriously though, was this made in 1991? Warcraft 2: Orcs and Humans had better graphics and combat mechanics.  No shooting sounds, no walking sounds, barely any sound at all...
9255	0	a	The game looks pretty fun to be honest, but i don't think i'll ever play it.   too many problems preventing me from even getting into the game.  -Official site nearly always down, you have to wait a long time on high speed internet for them to send you a verification link after making an account -if you manage to even log in, the faulty launcher gets stuck in an infinite loop, constantly deleting and redownloading the same files.  take a look at the issues the playerbase has with getting access to this game, and save yourself some time.

8586	0	a	Its like Mexican Candy (No offence to Mexicans just a Joke) It Looks good but really Its â¥â¥â¥â¥. Worth your Time? Dont! you know the awncer, its like Going to the mexican store and getting the candy you are clearly gonna throw away is more worth your time.
2540	1	a	fun as heck 
7365	0	a	Gameplay is good, honestly. Lots of customization, etc. The real problem is the game is unplayable. It has seriously terrible lag spikes and makes the game is so hard to play with. Lots of players complained about this. If they fix the lag spikes, improve something heavy on the game or even make game changes, it maybe could be better.
5547	0	a	The game was fun while it lasted, arresting people, clan war all that stuff was fun, however, two things ruined it; One, the game became very pay to win. I mean, you could play and still kill SOME people, but if someone has a gun that cost 3.99 and you've got your little peashooter, you're dead meat.  Two, and this is the main thing, and if it gets fixed, I'll come back to playing it, and I may be tempted to pay some money, but this really isn't easy to fix. Here goes: The game has a few servers, one for newbies, one for casuals, and one for veterans. The problem is that casuals and veterans will repeatedly get themselves killed to lower their rank, and then they gang up on the newbies. Yes, people are that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. They think their big and bad when they do that, and they call everybody 'Noob!' and think they're good.  Overall, I think the game is really awesome, but until they find a way to keep veterans away from the casuals and newbies, the game is unplayable. You can't even get better, because you're litteraly dead within seconds.
10867	1	a	So much rage inducing fun! I have a love/hate relationship with this game.
5798	0	a	Meh its just meh, its not good or bad just... meh. Its free so you can give it a try, i played 20h on â¥â¥â¥ or smth like that. There are beter f2p games on steam like team fortress 2 or warframe.
3378	1	a	APB Reloaded is the best F2P game but cheater destroy the fair play in critical fights. The cheater can activate and deactivate the cheats in seconds. They switch very fast their 'god mode' because they donÂ´t want to be detected and banned.  The game is a third-person shooter with RPG-like character settings.  At the beginning you have to choose one side - enforcer or criminal, which you canÂ´t change easily. The huge variation of weapons you have are impressive and make fights really tactical and hard. Teamplay is really important in APB but lots of players fight solo - including me.  IÂ´ve learned to fight alone against groups but that was two years ago - Meanwhile, I have forgotten it because the cheaters made me angry and i decide to stop playing APB.  I hope that the developers from APB had a solution to detect cheater, why i started a week ago to play APB.  LetÂ´s hope iÂ´ve made the right choice !  If the cheater problem is solved i can recommend hundred percent APB !!!
2859	1	a	Love the game and the customizations but some hackers r spoiling it
10453	1	a	Got killed by a crab that had a computer monitor as its shell.   10/10
286	1	a	If you want a review listen to me. These people are the same creators as GTA. Can you stop posting unprofessional comments like '10/10 Barely Played it'. If you commented that wouldn't you have click the thumbs down button? You guys that thinks this game sucks â¥â¥â¥â¥ you guys. THIS GAME IS AWESOME! 1000/1000
6054	0	a	This game is good apart from it takes ages to load and i cant even play it at the moment cos it keeps having to download directx
1937	1	a	Mediocre, through and through. An good try but F2P limits its potential.
7407	0	a	Only thing I LOVE about this game is the custome tatoos, shirts, and cars, however, in order to gain full access to customization tools, you need to pay real money to unlock more layers...wtf! That is just a bumer for me, still manage to get some nice logos done. After the customization side of this game, it's pretty bad. It's pretty much GTA Online for F2P. It's call F2P, but those who spent real cash has a giant advantage over those who don't. Good weapons are all really high rank and requires a lot of grinding to get. This game is not beginner friendly at all.
3675	1	a	game is bad but its my most played steam game and will probably stay that way forever. god help me
5138	0	a	I am going to compare this to GTA Online or Saints Row as it is that style of gameplay  1. Acess to fun:  GTA Online, I have to boot up the game, click on online, I'm in and I can blow up cars.  Saints Row, I have to boot up the game, join a friend, start the game, I'm in and I can blow up cars.  In APB Reloaded, I have to boot up the start menu, update the game, start up the game itself (Which sometimes opens up a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Facebook 'like this' page and you have to click Start again), Then select the character, then join the correct district then select the spawn and then have no idea where to go because you selected the wrong district and have no idea where to go.  Character Customisation:  In GTA Online it is the worst character creation ever, you choose the grandparents and parents and that's how your characer looks like, no wonder my character looks like â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t  In Saints Row 3 and 4 the customisation is great. It leaves enough options to be extremely customizable but few enough to be simple  In APB Reloaded it is like Saints Row but the camera angles are confusing, the advanced mode gives too many options while the quick mode gives too little options. It is the worst of both worlds.  And that's as much of the game I know of. As it took too long to get any-â¥â¥â¥â¥ing-where with the game as it was complicated and boring to figure out where to go.
5055	0	a	pease of sh*t
6748	0	a	I got to say that this game has became a really bigger garbage of game since i stopped playing it for like almost a year and when got back into it the hackers known as some of my friends were and are still on and hacking. This fairfight piece of garbage only do 40% of it's job and what else the premium weapons now come with a aimboot mod in it, G1 really â¥â¥â¥â¥ed this game up all they want is money from you but can't spend it on fixing this bugs and the game physics i been playing this game since 2011 a year after it came out and i gotta say it was the best PVP, MMO game i ever played i used to have no life and play it all â¥â¥â¥â¥ing day till it became a complete piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ 2 years later. Hackers started to hack just because of the Pay to Win situation but all though i have to thank G1 a lot for â¥â¥â¥â¥ing this game up thanks a lot G1.
2438	1	a	I recommend anyone who likes online games and a relatively large arsenal of weapons...
5277	0	a	Honestly what is this game anymore? 
4707	0	a	This game has been trash since it was in beta before 'reloaded' don't waste your time.
7627	0	a	Banned by punkbuser for 'cheating' when I certainly did not. Poor custom support, NOT RECOMMENDED.
1876	1	a	One of the best 3rd person arcade shooters out there.  Loaded with customization options, some may suggest it's P2W, but the game is largely skill based. General car controls are a bit iffy, but are manageable. Character controls are responsive.  Community is pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥ and look down upon newcomers, the developers are slow. And the game likes to chew up to 4 or 5 GB of your RAM.  Despite all of it's issues, it's a solid game, and deserves a go, it's one of a kind game.
242	1	a	Truely my favourite game, is pay to win and by that I mean that if you buy stuff for the game you have an advantage over the free to plays. In my own opinion this is better than GTA as this has much more play time and effort and customization. If I'm bored, I play APB. If I'm tired, frustrated or just feel like having fun I play APB. I LOVE APB.
9501	1	a	The Fallen Earth its like DayZ

2687	1	a	it is fun but deffinitly is not free to play if you want to actually have guns. they start you out with â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ weapons annd the most basic stuff. no more than a rifle a pistol and some clothes, while others are driving arounnd in their 30$ irl money cars with 10$ guns with their fancy clothes that also costs money. not a fun game if you want to play it FREE.
5751	0	a	Could be the best grand theft auto game ever if they didn't just want to make money, powerful weapons are only yours for a certain time then you have to rebuy them

9307	1	a	I actually purchased this game a long time ago, and played it then, got distracted by some other really good games. But this one is online, and has the perks you get with an online game. Thru Steam it is Free To Play, and I can't seem to get the game to start. Did a file validation, there were 11 files missing. I already have an account with Fallen Earth, so I should be good to go, as soon as I get those 11 missing files. What could have happened? Looking forward to getting started again and I'll update my findings. Yay Steam.
2812	1	a	Wont Start what to do?!

516	1	a	APB:R Is a dynamic play style game. Some elements of the game include dynamic events (Like Witnessing Crimes for enforcers and mugging and ram raiding for criminals). The customization aspect of the game is incredible, you can make your own symbols using the editor or choose from a library of preset decals to place on your clothes or vehicles however you see fit. The gameplay is a mix of open combat and close quaters combat across foru different maps. Events are included like easter egg hunts around holidays like easter. If you like causing or stopping chaos or police roleplay you will like this game.
9681	0	a	I have to say i was playing a while and... THE GAME IS â¥â¥â¥â¥. It's boring, has alot of bugs ex. no sound when punching, the story is bad. I don't reccomend it for gamers, it's just a waste of a time.
9238	1	a	cool as â¥â¥â¥â¥ 
6902	0	a	If you see an hour played, thats the time ive tried starting the game and cant even play it -.-
778	1	a	best multiplayer game I'v ever played. I recommaned It to all who love action filled multiplayer games:)
614	1	a	this game is awesome! you can be cops or crims you can get money from missons and buy cars and clothes and guns! and you can do missons with friends and buy thing for your car and get a name and edit your people!
5316	0	a	bad graphics and gameplay.
9028	1	a	Tired of boring shooting while 'locked on target', or bland 'auto aim' and just dull dice rolling for hits? Want to put that aiming in your hand to good use in an MMO? This might be one hell of a post-apocalyptic game for you then. The mounts and vehicles are pretty cool, too. Something different than your run off the mill game.
10099	1	a	This game is awesome you get skills like in maplestory and you get to make your own guns and armor and vechiles 
3967	0	a	Mixed feelings about this game. If you've spent enough time on it, it's a great expereince. But if you're a little impatient, and don't like the very repetetive stuff, I would not recommend it.
416	1	a	the game is great but when i open it , it closes it self.
8500	0	a	DO NOT INSTALL THIS GAME!
6475	0	a	Great consept. Poor execution. Repetertive, clumsy, dosn't 'capture' the mmo-feeling, not the most interesting world. Milking the cow.
1514	1	a	only if there was a medieval game like this
5930	0	a	This game basically needs a bit of cash splashed onto it to work. its a good f2p game but, you need to pay money to get good guns to do good. using the in-game currency to buy perma-guns would be nice. This game handles itself strangely. pay like 35 in-game credits for a permanant clothing item but pay 1300 credits for a leased gun. The artwork that people post for this game looks nice.  A remake (or sequel) would be nice (if there was no need to pay real money). Hit detection can be S.H.I.T but if you pay like 100 usd to buy a SINGLE permanent gun you won't have a problem. And as RELOADED ENT. are money â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s they sell in THE CASH SHOP leased guns. LIKE WTF. don't play until it gets made better.
8236	0	a	7 hours, a total of seven hours, and it crashed twice. Once when I was customizing my shoes, and a second time driving down the street. I also died about sixteen times due to lag, as well as flipped 3 cars due to lag. If the game was at ALL stable it would be amazing, the character, car, and tag customization is mind blowingly deep. Made me kind of wish I had any artistic talent what so ever. As it stands I cannot recommend it with how unstable it played, but I really wish I could. Good game, badly held together.
2088	1	a	0/10 did not even download the game
4452	0	a	APB Reloaded was a fun game at first, but things took a turn for the worse. The game is a huge pay-to-win, you have to buy in-game money to actually be able to even have a sliver of hope in winning PvP battles.  The verdict? Don't waste your time on this game.
6340	0	a	Reasons it is bad 1 Pay-to-win 2 Unblanced 3 Hackers that they do nothing about 4 Runs terrible 5 Looks terrible 6 Plays terrible
4273	0	a	Wont download...
10072	1	a	there are zombies and the game is first person and third person u also start with some wepons like a sniper and axe download it
918	1	a	Love this game, Just starting the game up, with the very broken launcher, to get in a server full of hackers/cheaters it not the best thing to come into when you have spend like half hour fixing the launcher :s
5284	0	a	Played this game from back in the Beta days years ago up to now, with a year break just recently.  And after all that Dev time (and $$$) and hours of people playing/complaining - not much of the terrible one sided mission/extremely broken mechanics have been updated/balanced. However the ARMAS market place has had MASSIVE upgrades, and a whole host of overwhelming 'Pay to Win' weapons/skins/stupidity have been added - goes to show where this studios heart lies. No new updates to reduce day 0 complexity for new gamers, no improvment in game modes/group sizes.  It's no surprise that player numbers have decreased a lot since I played last. My only comments are really for the Gamers first platform - DO SOME REAL DATA ANALYTICS. People don't want a few â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ car mods and pointless skins to convert from a free to premium player -- They want a real reason to grind that all important level, unlock that great weapon, make something else available. Account wide pay to win weapons? Fine! no problem, but at minute 1? The freemium model you use might be great for short term conversion - but it will kill your playerbase ---- I told you so.  TL;DR This game has amazing potential in terms of its concept and execution, it's only a matter of time before someone else does it better. Play it and enjoy if you are bored - but don't invest heavily - you will infinitely regret it.
9675	0	a	this game has aids and will give you aids
10770	1	a	This game isn't pay to win, it just takes a little longer to get better if you dont spend money on the game.
5989	0	a	I have created a character. About to choose which server im going to play on. Click on the one with lowest ping. And then I cant click the next button. Whats the problem?
9159	0	a	WHAT A PIECE OF DOGSHIT! Don't even try it!!!!! NEVER!!|||||||||||||
34	1	a	Curse you Lag !! That put aside , this is a really entertaining and competitive collage of intense firefights pitting good against evil . Unique customization options allow you to create your imagined super soldier to wreak havoc or bring peace . It's dominate or be dominated !
6140	0	a	While this game is very good on its idea, it's extremly hard for new players to get in. I really liked the game, but even with many years of expierience in multiplayer shooters, if you don't pay real money for your equipment, including weapons, you're basically screwed. This is to my opinion the best example to show the great unbalance between Free2Play and Pay2Win gamers. No chance.  You'll lose the whole. damn. time. at every single mission and this takes the whole fun out of a basically good game.
6895	0	a	The customization level of this game is unmatched by any other game. Unfortunely thats the whole highlight of the game. The gun play is really horrible, with terrible gun balance and lots of bunny hoppers. The matchmaking is an aboslute joke. The driving is sub par, but playable. The maps are great for driving around on, but not really fun for gun battles. The whole of the game from start to finish is random groups of people gunning down other random groups while safe neutrals troll you. Lastly the marketplace prices are insane. $20-$30 USD to unlock one gun for your account, Their supposed to bring out a new engine at some point to fix a lot of the issues, but until then its just not worth playing.
4501	0	a	Dont bother.
3518	1	a	It's fun if you play with friends and want to get cancer sheerly based on the community.
5093	0	a	i spent 2 hours trying to open this â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game and it still did not work
7847	0	a	It sucks for anyone not runnin top of the line systems, its laggyu hacked hardcore and by far the worst game iv ever played 
6953	0	a	If you can't play GTA then play this.  If you can play GTA then play GTA instead.
3910	0	a	this game sucks pay2win
2129	1	a	Awesome game, free version of GTA? probably.. yes sometimes you might get mad at this game but think again, at least your playing something. 
9518	1	a	Got molested in a cave by Mutated Ants  10/10
7183	0	a	lags like a dogs â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ if you dont have a pre good pc and is about as fun as watching dog â¥â¥â¥â¥ dry to play 4/10
1984	1	a	IT WAS FUN THEN I GOT TO GOLD AND THEN WENT AGAINST PEOPLE WITH GUNS YOU BUY FOR $10
9459	0	a	apparently this used to be enjoyable. but at this point its just pay to win.
6784	0	a	Game lags like â¥â¥â¥â¥ even on beast computers, community is â¥â¥â¥â¥ but mainly because the developers are absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥... lying about progress, making excuses not talking to community as well as randomly banning players without providing evidence, game is quite a dictatorship with poor decisions on the development team who refuse to listen to the players.
8260	0	a	How to play this game: -install -check if there are still only timed weapons for f2p -if yes, uninstall and try again next year  cya in 2017
5487	0	a	Matchmaking is very frustrating. (Two Silvers v. Two golds) Weapons feel unbalanced, and paying members are definitely the winners in this (Pay-to-win) Freemium game.
2445	1	a	Wasn't expecting this game to be so enjoyable
3178	1	a	Played...  Died...  Spent Money...  Couldn't stop even when things got bad...  Things got better...  Became a 'somebody as one of the trailers suggests...  Spent more money...  Satisifed with the 600 dollars spent on this game and the endless customisation.
8123	0	a	Borind. And ugly. Not because of the game it self, but mostly cause of the players. Do not download.
5409	0	a	Game is RUINED. The new company with zero management skills took EVERYTHING away from older players (mainly the game itself) and made it easier and more appealing to ignorant and obnoxious 13 year old callofdutyâ¥â¥â¥â¥, animeâ¥â¥â¥â¥, bronyâ¥â¥â¥â¥, and potheads who use their mommy's credit card to buy a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing $10 GUN in a game so they can grief the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of everyone else that use to enjoy it and other than that they have nothing else better to do than hump eachother's female avatars while they listen to gay japanese music, who have now OVERUN the game. Any comments or complaints of their eratic behaviors are met with fierce opposition from almost the ENTIRE community. This is coming from a day one beta player with 100+ hours and if you don't believe me, DON'T try it for yourself.
476	1	a	its a great game love it if you want a free GTA/sunset overdrive game you got it 
6603	0	a	when I played APB before it became 'Reloaded': the shooting controls felt sloppy yet unforgiving; gunfights took place in poorly-designed spaces that were extremely difficult to traverse; the world felt empty most times and nonsensical at others. caveat emptor.
2796	1	a	-
8241	0	a	Great now with the new anti-cheat system. Still abit to laggy tho but cannot complain WAY better than a year ago.
10170	1	a	Apart from the long grind this game has around lvl 5 and beyond. if you love fallout and post apocalyptic games then this for you
2621	1	a	its amazing  
5468	0	a	Tried to be gta, failed.
7275	0	a	well all i have to say about this game is that its completely bull crap because every time u try to log in with your email and password it always gives that error 11386 or something like that and u try looking it up on youtube or something to tell u how to fix it we follow the directions and it still doesnt work and its annoying u cant really enjoy this game when u cant even GET PASS THE FREAKING SIGN IN AND ITS FREAKING ANNOYING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i highly not recommend this game
10766	1	a	Good game to play to kill time.
3100	1	a	This game is like free cancer
2167	1	a	This game is stupid but it's fun to mess around in. It's like GTA IV's multiplayer except with more meat and a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ier engine (the community is just as bad though!). I wouldn't recommend it without a friend to play with, unless you actually enjoy Arabs and Mexicans screaming at you in teamchat for 'stun gun is bad pick up a real gun noob'.
8534	0	a	just â¥â¥â¥ this thing
10699	1	a	i played it for a while and i died and then i cried but i saw others having fun so its good
3529	1	a	Cool game for going all out against hordes of cops/criminals. Also, very good customization options, I recommend. 
3385	1	a	don't know why so much people whine about unfair MM, learn to aim its not harder then that, i have played 65 hours and still stomping people who is lvl 255, can do it with the first weapon to, they just don' realise how to aim and learn it.. it takes like 10 hours to understand the recoil in the game..
7689	0	a	this game is like no other game thats i have ever seen befor this game has so many hackers so many glitches and so much profanity its a shame to call that a video game i was very interested in the game and was very very up set i couldnt progress because its such a mess in that game and i hope any parent that sees this game does not buy it for there child this game need to be banned. this is y people are being bullied and pushed around this game is garbage.   p.s. SUCH A SHAME
435	1	a	This Is A Nice Game I HAvent Played it

9611	0	a	i have created almost 5 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing accounts and each and everyone of them are not 'valid' to play the game i waited over and hour for it to download for the game just to â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t me? these are the type of people who need to â¥â¥â¥â¥ off and get banned from making games
5883	0	a	this game ruined my sound.
5739	0	a	SUCKS IF I COULD LOAD IT 
3552	1	a	Played it since its first beta before official launching, best costumization i have ever seen. Tons of fun with clanmates or friends.  will keep you busy for awhile.
5285	0	a	This game originally failed because of core problems that existed in the game and the complete ineptitude of the developers (when they were Real Time Worlds) to fix or at the very least alleviate these problems.  Now on top of those issues you have an utterly broken cash shop system that will ruin your experience 95% of the time.  To start I should address some of the original problems that plagued the game on it's original releaes, guns were (and still are) terrible to use and the application of modifications does not make that any better. The gunplay feels clunky and the recoil on most weapons make it impossible to hit anything less than 5 feet infront of you. that is unless you use specifc weapons.  Cars are in the same boat as guns, for a cops and robbers MMO, you think they would be able to get the driving down. This is not the case. The car physics are terrible and they don't control that great either.  The mission system is absolute garbage, you can follow through multiple objectives, winning one after another. but if you fail the final one (, you will instantly, ignoring the fact taht you and your side were dominating the opposition;; fail the entire mission (And I find this happens more for the enforcer faction than the criminal faction, in all my time playing). This is further problematic with the addition cash shop weapons.  Now your thinking: Wow, hopefully the new developer and publishers would of picked up this game up and would of tried to fix these issues, which while do not make the game unplayable, do not provide an enjoyable experience for prolonged periods of time.  Well, no. They ignored these issues.  And I haven't even mentioned the games instability, poor performance even with modern hardware. or the failure for the game to completely shut-down once your done playing (One of the processes used in the game will ALWAYS STAY UP).  What they did bring to the game. was one of the worst things they could of done. They added a cash shop for guns, no no, not cosmetics. these guns have an actual performance advantage over other guns that you can actually aquire through gameplay.  These wonderful items provide superior damage, little to no recoil in addition to some other effects they can provide.  This damages the poor mission matchmaking and balancing because if your enemy team has these weapons, and you don't well, your screwed. in laymans terms.  Now to be fair, the new devs have actually added some content in the game with the addition of the 'Chaos district' and in game events. These aren't that great though, they aren't even the quality of the RTW content (Which isn't that great either), and the events are hampered by people rampantly cheating. Which I forgot to mention, is incredibly commonin this game (from outright use of hacks, to exploiting faults with the game or going out of bounds.)  the only positive thing I can say about the game is it's customisation system. and, unfortunately ,that hasn't seen any improvements since release of the ORIGNAL release. There is very little added to customise yourself since then (that that which is added is cash shop items -- go figure.) and while the emblem creator is nice and all that, if you don't have the ability to use it (since you cannot import emblems and pictures, you use geometric shapes to create them) thats just a wasted feature, and you will be dependant on the auction house to find anything you want. Which is ALSO an issue since people find it prudent to sell their crap for stupid huge amounts of money, and you can't filter or search by name of what your looking for. so if you want anything past 'T' for example. be prepared for LE EPIC TROLL FACE MEME XDDD!!! for the next 40 pages.  To sum this up: If your looking for a GTA MMO, this isn't that. go play GTA instead, if your looking for a fun Free-to-Play game, this Definitely isn't for you. becuase this game is by no means 'Free' and it's not fun either. I tried to cover everything I experience in my time playing this game, I probably missed something that would make me go for another 5 paragraphs. so it's best to stop here.  TL;DR: Games â¥â¥â¥â¥, p2w garbage. devs don't give a crap about the game and army of cheaters, go play some other game.
10726	1	a	Fun game with some bugs. It is a good transition to Hardcore (permadeath) games, as it is a bit more casual than fx Path of Exile.  I would describe it as a For the luls hardcore game. If you get hooked it can get expensive, as you don't get much on your account to start with.
8666	0	a	game just ins't fun anymore. This game has barely had any updates in the past few years. They are just milking this game dry. Please spend your hard earned money elsewhere than on this POS.
7397	0	a	This game is allright, you know fun to play with a group of friends (not so much solo) but thats down to your own play style, this game is obviously still updating and getting better and better but most people wont enjoy this game for many reasons  - Hackers (they still exist in the game and there isn't anything really being done to get rid of them, even punkbuster is doing a â¥â¥â¥â¥ job) and when the hacker eventually gets banned a new one is born, so it's a never ending cycle and I mean if you always get put against a hacker, yes you can be lucky and own a hacker since most hackers are complete and utter idiots so it's easy but most of the time it's just dam impossible to play the game when there are â¥â¥â¥ bugs like this running around using wallhack, aimbot etc etc.  - Lag - This is still an issue today server lag is too dam high and it's annyoing kind of spoils the game really when people or yourself are warping around like a little â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ so it can be frustrating, there is talk about them upgrading their servers at somepoint but even then I don't think it will be any time soon we have nice running smooth servers, it's a pile of wank  - Glitch spots - you have the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ in this game that like to exploit the games princibles by putting the item in a stupid to get location or an OP spot, this too is a game spoiler as it ruins the fun when the ennemy oposition are just camping like little â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥es, this gets â¥â¥â¥â¥ing annoying and pisses me off, so it eventually turns you bronze. It's stupid and G1 need to â¥â¥â¥â¥ing do something about these stupid locations  There are many other reasons why this game is total crap, but the game also have good parts, fun to play etc but it does get boring eventually and hackers/lameidiots just makes the game boring.  GamersFirst make enough money from Armas Marketplace yet they just don't do anything good about it, rather than fixing the easy, obvious to fix issues they'd rather create more crap to put on the marketplace for people to buy, fix the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game already but yea, I don't recomment this game especially since you have to start from the bottom and work up, with idiots on this game your just going to get â¥â¥â¥â¥ on.
1649	1	a	Kind of like GTA Online.
3545	1	a	Would waste 3000 hours again, 1/10.
1844	1	a	Its epic 
5505	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing garbage, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ gameplay, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ tutorial, and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game that keeps running even when you quit. 10/10 would play again
3029	1	a	I love games where first of all you get to choose either female or male, but customization is key for me. Being able to control something like that is top notch already. But i love the feel of the game too. Flows nicely and i enjoy every step of the way.
4627	0	a	This Game sux ... Bad Gta 5 MP simulator -  Not playable  Unbalanced fights  Random â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ts  Only 3-4 missions all time just random places...  Graphic lvl Mario (btw mario still best than this)  +   here? hmm wait... nope
3346	1	a	Yea, this game, its addictive, yep. You start, then you don't finish. This. Game. Is. Addictive. So if you want to have a life, have friends, and not think crazy thoughts, don't play this game. Yea. Yes.
8446	0	a	Just can't get into it for some reason.
8692	0	a	can't get past launcher. not worth the time.
3997	0	a	this is my dong wrapped in paper
3085	1	a	Pretty Good if you get used to it, no real pay2win and alot of options for free players.
3708	1	a	Couldn't last a second without hackers 10/10
6366	0	a	It has virsuses 
4449	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥
1691	1	a	Customizing is da â¥â¥â¥â¥
3525	1	a	I still like this game has alot of going for it but its already been out soooo long and they could have fixed so much stuff by now but they just dont.... They really just need to listen to the MAJORITY of the players not the 200 random douches that cheat on this game or just pay to win
1943	1	a	VERY good customization, anything from clothes to cars to your own EYES can be customized almost infinitely! Gameplay is solid, has very good shooting mechanics and the misson system is just to die for, however the car driving seems to lag for me, (probably my crappy internet), but it is still a very engrossing game, i played 8 hours last night, all in all 9/10, i reduced the score by one since latency issues are a bit to severe even for people with good internet.
10402	1	a	This game was fun but far too slow for me to really get into a lot I gave it a bit of time but the progression was just way too slow for me I felt as if I was playing WoW and the tutorial system was just as bad as WoW's when I tried this game though even with that all being said the game looked great and it showed a lot of promise.   While this type of game isnt for some people myself included I would still recommend it just for the fact that the game itself doesnt feel lieks ome kind of horrible ten minute made on a low budget game. The quality of this game is amazing and the simple fact that its free makes it all that much better I don't understand why so many people have a mixed view of this game but I am sure its in part to the fact that the community wasnt very nice to new players.
7069	0	a	wtf is this?
9759	0	a	Pros:  tons of content you can walk through horses you can walk through cars Cons: The engine sucks The gameplay is dull repetitive Kill by standing still and shooting or standing still and melee (movement in fights usually dosnt matter since it's out in the open and they lock on) IT JUST SUCKS!!!!
9961	1	a	Fallen Earth could be better but it's still not a bad MMO to play to get away from more mainstream MMO's.
4479	0	a	Awesome game but %80 of cheaters.. Websites are selling script for this game.. so boring
2500	1	a	Very fun to play with friends. Alone it's not as fun but still it is. Being a nice change to other Free 2 play MMOs.
3960	0	a	This game sounds interesting, but matching system is totally BROKEN. You will force matched lv50ish veterans in first ten minuites and got bullied AGAIN AND AGAIN. Do not play this. ------------------- ãããã³ã°ã¶ã£å£ãã¦ãããã§ãããã©ã³å¢ã«ããã³ããã¾ãã
6393	0	a	nah. pay 2 win, pretty empty world, that stuff.  sounds great, but it just isn't.
8861	0	a	World is not interesting, enemies are not interesting, dungeons are boring with bullet sponge bosses. The end game pvp is borderline pay2win with the way the shop works. The combat is aim/action based but still uses spammy hotkey skills. Overall the combat is worse than WoWs style due to how horrible the animation and unbalanced the skills are. The crafting takes a long time to do unless you pump money into the game. You can straight up buy the best vehicle in the game, and you have to buy a item to craft the best weapons. This is not fallout the mmo, this is a sad attempt to milk fallout fans.  I have a lot of time in it from pressure by friends to play it. Same reason WoW still has so many subs who don't actually like the game much, they play it as a social experience. Also have a lot of time simply from being AFK. The best way to level is waiting in a place called Citadel. Also crafting is only viable if you AFK in game next to a bought crafting table.
8905	1	a	I consider myself very discerning when it comes to games. I don't play very many, but the ones I do play I tend to play a lot. More often than not I'll find myself getting bored of whatever game I'm trying out within the first few hours. I decided to try this game out and take a chance on the mixed reviews after seeing it on Steam many many times.   At 30 hours in I can safely say I'm hooked. The crafting system really is AMAZING. Potions, poisons, medical kits, weapons, armors, clothing, dyes, VEHICLES (including but not limited to motorcycles, ATV's, cars, trucks), and you can craft create temporary building and camps. That's just a small portion of it.  Skill system is easy to use and straight forward, combat is familiar and was easy to transition to, not sure what else I can say.   On the negative side, the game world coudl use some more clutter. Wandering around the map feels quite barren. And the server downtimes need to be addressed. This is killing this game for me despite all the great potential it has. I've been playing it for 5 days and the servers have gone down for 1 hour intervals at least 3 times and has gone down for extended intervals on anther two seperate occasions. This is on top of regular maintenance. This needs to be fixed ASAP. Despite this I'll give this game a positive review and recommend it assuming this one huge issue will be fixed ASAP
7395	0	a	Okay,at first i kinda liked it but suddently i was doing a mission with the starter guns and they aren't half bad,real ammount of bullets for its real version is really close exept the snipers and M4s just 1 shotting every car in the game: gun balance extremely bad i get dominated by five-sevens  do not reccomend this game to anyone (exept hackers)
9631	0	a	its an alright game but i didnt get what i expected
2463	1	a	Makes me moist in my â¥â¥â¥â¥.
2183	1	a	I think they should make this Mac supported :) Its a really good game and would be even better if everyone had access
6065	0	a	Poor optimization
1577	1	a	Allowed me to review the game before I downloaded it , so I say: -11.35853595837594/-10 because glitchin review. Trololololololololol
1592	1	a	i have not played it yet ut i havve seen it on youtube and it looks good its like GTA
4865	0	a	They were kicking me from the server's for no reason
6982	0	a	The game michanics could be tweeked and the graphics could be better but it seems like a big pay to win.
6870	0	a	BEWARE!  I played this game for about 2 weeks, I even bought into this game, and the item shop. (Yes, it is pay to win)  However I was banned under the PunkBuster system it was then using. It now uses FairFight, but I don't know if that will make much of a difference. My experience with the Customer Service was atrocious. First they told me I was banned because I was 'observed cheating' then later told I was never observed, but rather it was a PunkBuster ban. Their recommended appeal process was to follow up with PunkBuster. When following up with PunkBuster they could not produce a 'report'. I also played many other games that at the time were using PunkBuster and did not produce any bans on any of these other games.   As mentioned in other reviews, I believe this is because there is a very active and corrupt team running this game. The slightest bit of e-sluethery will net you many posts regarding these accusations. The community is dying slowly from this and it is quite sad. Because the game itself is actually quite entertaining and a decent time sink if it weren't for such poor mismanagement from day 1 through now.
4514	0	a	Very few legit players left.  APB was one of the best games ever made. Sadly the company that purchased it Gamers First is one of the worst gaming companies out there. The issue with Gamers First is they have never had live anti cheat of any kind for APB. In turn this has allowed hackers to pretty much take over the game. During the past 2 years legit players have been leaving this game in masses due to the lack of working anti cheat. This game has been reduced to downloaded skills  I do not recommend this game for anyone that values legit gaming.
6199	0	a	When you first play this game your immediate idea is 'Aww yeah. I'm going to be a bad*** robber.' Sadly the curtain falls away to reveal the issues with the game. The fact you constantly have to buy guns or shell out a fair bit of cash to have a perm gun. The vechiles vary greatly which is awesome but again you often times have to shell out real money for the good things. The game play is sad. Basicly meaning anyone who pays the money for the best gear is probably going to win.   All in all it was fun for a short bit but after a while the zeal subsides.
8839	0	a	Im pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ that the game could not properly install or run. I've been at it for a few hours now troubleshooting endlessly.  1. I had problems with the launcher installing Visual C++ 2005, 2010, etc. 2. Every time i launch it says installing Direct X, making no progress as far as i can tell. I checked my task manager and could see the Direct X installer doing its thing. Yet every time i launch it tries to install Direct X again. 3. I recieved an error that said something about it not installing properly. I changed the properties for the launcher so that it ran as administrator, hoping it would fix the problem, alas no progress.  Im pretty dissapointed, I was excited to play the game, and still am but this is frustrating.
6195	0	a	In the beginning i had no idea what to do, so i just walked arround random and killed NPC's. eventually i knew how to ram a shop with my car, and i earned money. with this money i couldn't do much. so at the end, i had 1 hour of fun and now every time i play the game (which is not often), i just get an overload of boringness.  EDIT: i have removed the game of my PC, and it seems to be les than an hour
8096	0	a	This is both the best and worst game I have played.   But the disadvantages definitely outweigh the advantages.   First off, you join APB and it seems pretty damn cool - the customization is extremely enticing, and is probably the best thing about the whole damn game. But then after you first create your character and have gone through basic game mechanics in the tutorial, you have to begin doing 'missions' which are a total and utter waste of time since the hierarchy system is as much use as a chocolate fireguard. You work through some crappy 'Threat level' system ... Green, Bronze, Silver, Gold - sounds like it is fairly simple but it's not. As soon as you move from newbie Green, and into Bronze you suffer from the worst insults ever from the community just based on the bloody colour of the logo next to your name - not even on your play ability!. For anyone new, this gets bloody annoying and will surely steer people away from the game.  I have been playing this for a year now, and have been Silver only a handful of times - only to move back into Bronze. I wouldn't mind, if the matchmaking system actually worked. Now tell me GamersFirst - how is it so that 4 bronze competitors can match in skill and experience against 1 Gold and 3 Silvers for example, that have Rocket and Grenade Launchers... how are these advanced players even able to pick that they want to be in a Bronze server? Of course when there is the 'easier' option, people will take it. Therefore why not remove that opportunity and keep Golds in Gold servers and Silvers in Silver servers. This is how the game was meant to be - so why not fix it? I understand people will say 'Oh there's no excuse to new people and bronzes, teamwork and skill can overcome any opponent - ' No, you're having a laugh. More experienced players have more advanced mods and weapons (and sometimes even hacks, but that's only on occasion now) not to mention experience, so of course the newer players and lower down players have no chance at all.   Another thing to point out, is that most of the community has gone to shreds. Today, I was called 'noob' followed by other eye-rolling names by a Silver on a Bronze server for killing them. Hmm hang on there? Killing them - that's the point of the game isn't it? And if anyone wishes to call me a 'noob' so be it but - really, they're a bit of a hypocrite if they're more advanced and have to stick to the server for Bronzes and newcomers. Furthermore, people often get annoyed with newbies Team Killing them - yes so do I, but if you communicate with them and tell them that you're on their team, and help them learn instead of just expecting them to be advanced and instantly know what the hell they're doing - the APB community will become a better place, and will save any frustration.  So here's the good stuff listed:  1 Extremely addictive 2 Customization 3 Variety of weapons/mods to unlock (without having to pay with REAL MONEY on Armas Marketplace) 4 (Team Work) - [In brackets because it's not always there] 5 Rewarding missions and Fight Club is great 6 Numerous different contacts to level up 7 Season events (Halloween, Christmas etc.)  And a summary of the bad stuff:  1 Newcomers will probably find it overwhelming 2 Bronze servers littered with higher threat levels 3 Needs a new matchmaking system 4 Community needs to be more helpful and more willing to accept new players 5 More communication between players 6 Server lags often occur, especially during Fight Club due to amount of players 7 Frustration when people are 'Away From Keyboard' during a mission - why not just kick them? 8 Occasional hackers 9 Just rude players genuinely ruining a game with so much potential  Ultimately, I'd say if you haven't, give this game a try. But in all honestly, it's just not worth the brain melting frustration.
5423	0	a	I was banned from this game a couple years ago for hacking. They put my username on a board of shame and everything. I forgot about it, but then a couple days ago, the people who run this game saw fit to remind me about the incident. They sent me an email saying they know I hacked, but that their willing to give me a second chance. Well guess what, I know I didn't hack, it was just your anti-cheat software banning me for a false positive detection. Here's hoping you've fixed that in the years since, and that you can convince people to try your game after they read reviews like this. I won't be giving you the second chance.
5379	0	a	i do not recommend the game. i have payed it a few times before but always ran into some kind of issue. this time my char that was saved in the system wont load and it kicks me. when i try to make a new one i cant get past making a name and choosing a server. waste of time.

4603	0	a	Falsely banned over 3 years ago. Terrible customer service as you can't even email them to contest the ban. Didn't respond to my BBB inquiry.   Had the nerve to tell me that I was justly banned but the need my money now so they are unbanning me. They can shove this game where the sun doesn't shine.
3619	1	a	As you can see, i am an Argonian, And i require a certain... Type of game, And this game is perfect for me and my reptilian Brethren 10/10 Would Play Again

2584	1	a	-=NOTE=- I REALLY LIKE THIS GAME, I'M JUST SENDING A MESSAGE ABOUT ONE PROBLEM  This is an AWESOME game, but there are SO MANY HACKERS!
73	1	a	very good game. its like gta but without the strippers. i think the only problem with this game is is that there arent any tutorials or how tos when you first start so your kinda on your own in terms of how to customize things. friend me: thatguy622
1211	1	a	this game is bay 2 win fun 
7525	0	a	I couldn't even play the freaken game because the stupid sky and screen of the game kept giltching and i couldn't even see. whatever you do save your memory and save your money. i would give it a 1 out of 10 if they could fix it. which might not even happen. DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2931	1	a	Prepare to die... A LOT! Particularly whilst you're new. Great character / car customisation, combat is so, so and be prepared to come across the odd cheater or two.  Apart from that it's good enough to waste a few hours on.
5700	0	a	Let me first say that I have several hundred hours from the sandalone version, so I've played more than the 7.9 on my account. The game is fun, it's sort of like a knockoff GTA. You can be a bad guy, rob shops and get into turf wars, do fun violent things, etc. The games biggest benefit, though, is the fact that you can also be a cop. Any cop players who see the criminal players doing bad stuff or doing missions can immediately intervene and **** them up, which makes for some good fun, and fighting real players as cops is a lot more fun than the crappy AI in games like GTA.  However, this game suffers immensely from it's pay-to-win tactics, through which you will dominate all other players if you have $20 to blow. The devs tout your ability to customize your character, despite the fact that if you want to place more than a few decals on your car or make an intricate design on your clothes you again have to pay money. Want one of the good guns? Give us money. Want to use said guns for more than a few days? MORE money. Want to get a decent car? ALL THE MONEY. You want to KEEP that car? Oh baby you know that's only allowed if you want to spend money. 'Wow our game is so cool and free-to-play.'  Honestly if they scrapped all the pay-to-win stuff and just charged $10-$20 for the game, this would be a fantastic game. The core features and physics are strong, the gameplay is fun when you're not being bulldozed by people with expendable income, and the game has tons of variety. But all of these strengths are shadowed by the money-grubbing nature of this game. Until they update to a new engine as they've been promising for a long time, and at least cut back on the pay-to-win features, this game is NOT worth playing.   In my opinion, the devs should just design the game again from the ground up with a new engine and release it as a seperate game at a reasonable price. There's no excuse to not do that.
9094	1	a	The title has nothing to do with the earth falling through space
9002	1	a	good game for poor â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ shit dickball anal â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥

690	1	a	I was minding my own business walking across the street. I looked both ways before doing so. As I was half way through crossing the street I was struck and killed by a cop. I mean sure I killed 10 people but I didn't deserve to be killed.
4977	0	a	Back when I had my crappy good ol' Pentium 4, the controls lagged like hell. When I upgraded to a half-decent computer in 2012, the controls lagged like hell. And now that I upgraded to a pretty decent gaming computer, the controls still lag like hell.  In all seriousness, the game itself is fine. The gunplay is what you'd describe as 'good enough', nothing fancy or innovating, but it works. The main problem I had is that the character customization actually lying to you and, as previously mentioned, the car controls. On the topic of characters, once you finish painstakingly customizing your looks (Which you can't change without paying an absurd amount of money I may add), your avatar looks barely like the one you created, which wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that I tried to replicate Frank West and ended up with Sloth from The Goonies.  And as far as the vehicle controls go, they're bloody awful. The cars themselves handle fine, or at the very least the Not!Audi TT you get at the beginning of the game, but there's an almost one second delay between you pressing a key and the car actually doing something, which obviously results in you driving like you drank half the stash of illegal alcohol you were ferrying around town. Sadly the community isn't very helpful when trying to fix this issue, as most of the replies you get are 'You suck', 'The game is pretty big, deal with it', or 'The game is fine, upgrade your rig' which the latter is kinda hard to do when you're running almost top-of-the-line hardware. I'm not TotalBiscuit, goddammit, I don't have enough money to buy four Titan Xs.  In short, if you can run Crysis 1 at 240 FPS on 4K resolution, I'd give it a shot, otherwise either don't; or get ready to do some cardio, as you'll be running all over the city.
2091	1	a	Originally released in summer 2010, published by EA and developed by the now defunct RealTime Worlds, APB is a competitive 3rd Person Shooter Sandbox Massively Multiplayer Online Game with rich character customization as one of it's primary features. Now in the hands of GamersFirst and Reloaded Productions, APB has been relaunched as APB: Reloaded, aiming to enhance the original, and expand on content. APB can be a fun game in short bursts, but will quickly become frustrating with it's steep difficulty curve and dependance on better gear, obtained either with ingame currency or through the ARMAS Market (Cash Shop). The system requirements are also painful if you wish to play on the highest settings, however, the requirements have been reduced in order to appeal to a larger market than when it launched in summer 2010. Despite my less than glowing review, I still recommend that you at least try this game.
6892	0	a	i made an account, went to validate my account , it said 'page not found ' i repeated it couple of times... didn't work, i went for help to the website but to get help i need to be logged in... 10/10 amazing gameplay (sarcasm)

5913	0	a	This game is confusing, no really, I don't understand anything
8716	0	a	This is a great game, fun to play, and enjoyable as you progress through the ranks as either an Enforcer/Criminal.  Unfortunately I will not play this game again, due to the community. Not even 5 minutes will pass without there being some outburst of someone accusing someone else of hacking, or being a noob. Even though there is a solution to this, it will never change on APB's community.  Hackers - Can be resolved through tightening security protocols etc. I mean when someone openly admits they cheat and have spent huge amounts of game-time proving it, as well as accumulating a large amount of reports, they still not banned? This game is not administered. Not at all. And if someone just has to google 'Aimbot for APB' etc just to get a download link and start ruining the game... Then there must obviously be a lack in administration.  As for those who repeatedly call someone noob. Kill team-mates repeatedly. Go AFK or just idle-by. Well done, you have just turned this game against itself. Those high ranked players who wish to be kicked from the team so as to not lose with some new players, achieved by harrassing and killing team-mates. Do they realize that they making the game un-enjoyable for new players. Let me put this simply... NO NEW PLAYERS = EVENTUAL SERVER CLOSURE.  I swear the community is childish. Someone once argued with me because he called me a noob, yet I agreed saying I was new to the game and added that he shouldn't be too hard on new players. Be a little mature, I said. The next 30 minutes of me trying to find out his reason for team killing resulted in him finding out he is 5 years younger than me. After that it was a pure ignore.  So basically, admins must admin the game. Players must not deter new players.
6066	0	a	This game has a lot of pros it's true.. But sadly to access those pros you will need to pay. A LOT. The customization from this game is incredibile you can make your car or character look exactly how you want it to look. But you need to pay for different bodykits for cars, or better clothes, or more space to add symbols on those things. If you are happy with a stock car and a simple outfit go for it but after that you will be surprised how much you can hate this game.. Always getting matched against more experienced opponents or players with premium weapons that are too overpowered to be killed. Seriously, those who can actually spend money on a game like this will get all the good stuff, giving new players reasons to not play this unfinished game. I guess the worst part of this game is the company that is curently developing it. This game is pay 2 win. If you want to try it, go for it but you will need a large wallet to play properly. Enjoy.
4619	0	a	Usually I don't downvote on a game concept like this, but the gameplay APB:Reloaded offers is completely awful. Gunplay is terrible, you need to spend real money in order to keep the weapon forever, players equipped with a pistol can kill you in 2 shots, but it takes 20-30 shots to kill them with an assault rifle, (this is close combat), overall for gunplay...it's just...clunky and static. Servers always lag. Most players stay in the 'Social District'. There is matchmaking but you can choose either to go into a Matchmaking PVP District, or No-Matchmaking PVP District. Surprisingly, rarely anyone plays in the Matchmaking PVP Version of a District. Driving a car is like driving a stick of butter, or driving a brick. You can customize cars and clothes as much as you want. Clothes in the market, created by other players will usually cost a lot of in-game money, around 100k when each mission you play against other players, will only give you 500 in-game money or lower. Completely it's a pay-to-look cool/win, mixed with bad game mechanics.   I like the game concept, but the ways done in the game...are just laggy and boring after a while.
5182	0	a	Well. It's been about 2 years. Time to try this again.  I can say I am not shocked to find there have been no major non-cosmetic/cash shop expansions. Customization, the games major draw, hasn't seen any much needed enhancement either.  I did not run into any hackers but there are a LOT less people playing the game now.  Matchmaking still sucks and the game plays like a 5 minute edit of the Unreal engine.  My advice remains the same. Play the game if you want but do not pay this company.
2791	1	a	APB is a very good game. Belongs to the sand table style game can be where you let all can go. There are many ways to do the task, very interesting
1293	1	a	This is an awesome MMO Sandbox game. But the open world could have been better and the vehicle handling is just awfull. There are a lot of glitches that needs to be fixed. The graphics are good. As its free to play i recommend it.
8518	0	a	Free GTA online that gets worse and worse every time you play  I'm not joking
4951	0	a	Wow...Not only does this game have a horrible 'recommendation' quota...  It also didn't work on my newly bought and built-to-play-games Ibuypower pc...  What a beauty to behold. I can not play this game at all yet I can still rate it conveniently...
3787	0	a	I spent way to much time and money on this game for nothing. Constant cheaters. The creators promised improvements such as an engine update. They have yet to bring updates. They only create new weapons trying to bring in money
3794	0	a	Four long years ago, when i first started playing, i wrote a review, basically saying this game will find what is wrong with your computer and profusely let you know about it. To this day i still use this game to iron out driver kinks and test hardware for faults. No clue why, but this game seems to be the best at letting you know whether or not your computer is worth its weight. Still does too.  For now, i'm going to speak more into the game, more in depth on the content and world of APB:R, and its affects to real life issues.  The game is beautiful, and has so much potential, the world is still caughing up silly little secrets and jokes that even the most seasoned vet of the title has yet to discover. There was a mobile app built that lasted roughly through beta, died out from the toxicity of the community, even though the community had actually asked for it. If the players were more in tune to the forum than reactive to it, maybe some benefit could come of the game, instead we have vet players remaining silent as the community of fresh meat green horns play the game for a day and shape the future by speaking out on the forums. There is a huge lack of communications, and slim to no community outreach program. The changes made to the game that the vet players seem to dislike come from those who really do not know how to play the game in the first place. OR, from those with computers that can't properly handle the game process. I saw one person in the forum claim his Intel Pentium Dual Core was 'Gaming grade' unfortuneatly, this is what we have to look forward to in the title that is APB:R. Computer illiterate noobs, players who take the mentality of 'be what you cannot be' too seriously, and a development staff just as toxic, though, not at all in the same way, the devs are just silent.  People don't realize how destructive silence really is, sure you can /ignore you're way through the community, but you're being no better than the person opening their mouth and showing how unintelligent they really are.  The game itself is a hacker, many people claim he/she is a hacker, but from what i've seen (and being called an aimbotter myself) the game is the hacker. The one thing that really rubs my fur the absolutely wrong way, hit detection. The devs really broke the game trying to fix that for the noob players who claimed they hit someone when they really shot the vending machine, in the building next door... they have such terrible aim, and no weapon control. So the devs went and reworked hit detection, well guess what... now the game lags out every single time a bullet comes near an opponent (op) the frames drop, and the game registers a few hits, but since it lagged so hard the gun only fired 3 rounds, and the op decides to take advantage of this and shoots back. The game has really become a mexican standoff for each mission, when i started playing there was such a thing as 'Spray n pray' or 'all out balls to the wall firefights' now, well now it's just depressing.  The game itself is the hacker... This has lead me to assume that many players i've opposed were the hackers, which then in turn lead to my anger generation going sky high. I have a roommate who refuses to speak to me or even be near me when i'm playing APB:R, i have a few friends online who cannot play the game anymore because of how angry they get. Honestly speaking, i too have stopped playing the game due to the anger problem, and the level neglect the development team has given the game. Seriously, i would not be phased if they shut down the game for the new engine to be completed and start up the game then!  The silence i spoke of earlier, and the neglect, and the game itself being the hacker... This can all be fixed simply by disconnecting the power cord to their servers, focus on building the new engine and console version, then merging the account's content into the new engine, and voila! new engine released, community was kept up to date, and the devs weren't split over 9000 ways. However, that would make sense, and as i've seen the devs don't listen to logic, they do their own special way of thinking, which is 'take on the hardest, largest workload and pick highly unrealistic due dates, then completely ignore the dwindling community.' I've spent a couple hundred bucks on this game, i know others have too, there is NO shortage of funds preventing them from getting the job done, and their last post from a year ago made sense, true, it would take more time to hire someone new to aid in the development to train them on what does what, but honestly, i competent coder can see what the code is, what you want and make it happen. Without complex tutorials teaching the guy how to code, without having to hold their hand, with a competent new hire coder, you give him a task, a due date, and you can bet that guy will bust his butt to make that due date, cuz he's the new guy, he's fired if he fails. I'm not sure how that works when the boss has been so lax in the due dates for the game now, seeing as there is roughly just 5 people (claimed) to the company working on APB:R (and who knows what else from G1) they have devs taking vacations, devs spending company time playing the game on twitch.tv (effectively extending the new engine upgrade that much longer)  The company that handles APB:R aka 'Reloaded Productions' or RP for short, is in a serious structure reworking. They've become complacent in their duties, deadlines, and ability.  The base game though... The game itself in a PvE perspective... as in, character customizations, customizations in general, and general concept, is absolutely perfect. And when GTA:V launched it was BETTER than GTA:V by a long shot! Though multiplayer wasn't really a GTA thing, it was modded into GTA:SA, which sparked the GTA:IV online aspect, which gave birth to GTA:O a concept that Rockstar Games didn't research on enough and flopped at launch, but they have since fixed it and so on... Now if only RP can learn from Rockstar Games (RG) what it means to 'fix' something. I cannot stress this enough... The devs at RP need to shut down APB:R and focus on the game engine only, fix that and start it up asap without split priorities, and THEN you can milk the dry cow for more money, or get a new cow and guarantee that milk will come.  This game currently has too many issues, and a super slow dev team, with an incompetent management system. Are you interested in playing the game? Wait, just wait. Do i recomment you play the game? Right now? god no, just wait until they launch the new engine. Is this game worth it? So long as the toxic community further poisons the minds of the Devs into ruining the game, no, not at all is this game worth a dime, the devs and managing staff need to learn who to listen to, before they make changes at all.

4112	0	a	Best Idea: replace gamersfirst, call an actually good company like RockStar or Bioware. The game is truly amazing, 5 dollars in and It is so much fun. but gamersfirst has GOT to go, RockStar or Bioware would have the best time with this as it is a bootiful game but gamersfirst got high while driving it and crashed the train, leaving many people dead (banned), injured (dissapointed), and scarred emotionally (turned into the toxic community we all know and hate today).

3144	1	a	No, I actually canÂ´t recommend this game to anyone. In the beginning youÂ´ll get kill-farmed by the veterans, the mission design is repetitive and the community is the worst IÂ´ve ever seen. Still, IÂ´ve played almost 450 hours with my two chars, so there has to be something with this game... Enjoy!^^
6153	0	a	No, just no, just don't install it, it's a waste of time and space.
8977	0	a	Fake Fallout online wannabe, Everyone has Bikes and Cars and you are stuck on a goddamm horse. â¥â¥â¥â¥ this â¥â¥â¥â¥, i'm out.
953	1	a	My face hurts because the Bullymong hit it. Wait that's the other bad game! Chuckle Chuckle Chuckie Finster! 1/65
2035	1	a	It wont start when i open the game it says the game is down for a maintrance. I have no â¥â¥â¥â¥ing clue what so ever how to fix it. this is to Gamersfirst. so i have nothing to say about this game, hope you guys like it B cus i cant...
7756	0	a	The concept seems to be 'an MMO-style GTA,' and essentially, it is.  In the beginning, when you learn what the game offers, it sounds like a truly great game, and it can be.  Keyword there is 'can.'  It is *EXTREMELY* difficult to get off the ground. The tutorial missions are near useless, and when you're thrust out in to the game world, expect to lose your first 10 missions. Badly. VERY badly.  If you expect to drive a car with any hope of control, prepare to be disappointed. The time between button-press and steering-response is EXCRUCIATINGLY long.  Driving requires awareness. Video game driving requires anticipation. APB Reloaded driving requires the ability to   PREDICT THE Fâ¥CKING FUTURE.    Maybe you won't have this problem, but I sure did. And getting around without a car is cumbersome and time-consuming (probably because they didn't plan for you to HAVE to play the game without transportation).  All that being said, my opinions of the game not being what you'd call 'good', it *is* a free game. So, my recommendation: Download it when you have a stretch that you're gonna be on your computer for a while, and try it out.  Why? Because you, quite literally, have nothing to lose in this transaction.  Don't like it? No money lost.  I'm not gonna recommened this game, though, since I...well, hated it, but if you have a good enough connection to download the game while doing whatever your daily stuff is, might as well, right?
1886	1	a	Very well made game and also can be extremely addictive,there will be a little lag now and then but its acceptable and not to bad
343	1	a	Really good game, has a great engine and gameplay, by the way the customization is like any other simply perfect, i love it :D
862	1	a	everybody is so butthurt becuse ftp has p2w but ofcourse they have it stupid if you make a free game and make so it doesnt have eny way to pay real money in it then wtf like you made aa game for millions and millions of dollars and then have no way to get payed for it you woudnt earn â¥â¥â¥â¥ for the game you spend millions of money making so next time you find a ftp game dont be so butthurt about pay to win
1607	1	a	very fun game. so much to do. never got bored playing this!
10424	1	a	Great game, crafters heaven, bit old looking but it is a bit old. There's plenty to do fun to make your character look like a bad@$$. The faction system feels so good and make you feel like you have control over what you do as you allign yourself with people of similar morals.The only big downfall to this game is the lack of player base and the small team working on it, if this game got more attention it would turn into something great. I really hope this game grows!
48	1	a	It is awesome and i love the customization options everywhere with clothes, cars, weapons, symbols, music, themes, srays and many more HOWEVER.... the PvP sucks BIG time, the enforcers are too weak and the criminals are to over powered with a ton of damage and they have to lower the damage delt by criminals... I mean.... do you really think criminals will have the upper hand in reality?  Yep, i rest my case :| oh well, i still like playing it but the PvP system needs to be changed or else this game will become dead to me :|
2548	1	a	This game sucks
790	1	a	One of those games I download every year or so, play for 5 minutes, then delete again. I love it.
6210	0	a	It's a pay to win game, or with extreme skill or hacks you will be able to live through a whole mission without dying.  3,5 out of 10 would bang if i was forced to.
5320	0	a	Piece of trash pay to win and matches you up with high level â¥â¥â¥â¥ faces. 0/10 uninstalled this waste of space, time and effort
10240	1	a	Nice game if you have some free time. Just try to scratch out of living like in my glourious Poland.
8880	1	a	Best post apocalyptic mmo I have ever played, but then again there are not many out there. I will admit as of this recommendation I am not that far in-game, but from what I have seen, it's definitely a keeper! You have got to try fallen earth.
10025	0	a	great for about 12 hours of gameplay. after that even dropping money on it doesnt make it better.
9018	1	a	A very good FPS game. Graphics are decent, and the mechanics and skill paths are virtually endless.  My one problem with it, however, has to be the endless grinding involved.
4116	0	a	the game fails to load at all no ater what i do and it goes he same with a mate of mine too
1994	1	a	Love it, I hate it, but thats why this game is so much fun, you can be losing and the next moment TABLES ARE TURNED, GUN FIRE ALL OVER THE PLACE TEAMMATES BLOWING EACH OTHER UP AND YOUR SUDDENLY WINNING. WATCHOUT ITS A GARBAGE TRUCK READY TO GREIF YOU BADLY...   got carried away there for a moment, but thats how this game makes me feel. its too fun and addicting.  I give thumbs up cause I've been playing for a long while now :) and once you get far in ranking its really enjoyable  Pros: you can meet some pretty interesting people on here and teamwork is vital which is the success to this games team vs team  cons: needs to get rid of the bots and ghosters, and G1 needs to be more truthful and up to date with there releases... still waiting on the engine update.. :( otherwise this is my first longest review, hope you all enjoyed my input...
9308	0	a	welcome 2 update simulator. so first lets update. 2 hours later (in-game time doesn't work propperly) let's start. i was very excited and then it happend. error..... so let's try again. error again. so don't waste your time.
2271	1	a	Matchmaking is just bad - you're teamed up against fully elite and decked out players at a low level Drug mules are good I guess, grab it and run, if you try to fight, prepare to get one shot Addictive game, fully customization options, create your own death ringtone (when you kill someone else) Ability to get a perm gun when you play the game up to a certain level (low lvl)
5106	0	a	I would not recommend this game to a single person unless they plan on pulling money out their â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ to be able to enjoy anything.  The community is horrible and consists of the same players winning over and over due to using the cash shop weapons and such.  There is no balance at all, you ready up and get thrown into missions with people that have been paying and playing for a whole lot longer than you.  Very rarely will you find a few people that are nice to play with.  Did I mention the community is a bunch of trolls?  1/10 the 1 in the rating is for that nice person who helped me beat a few ridiculously high level players in a mission for once
4322	0	a	This game is fun and all, it's just that there's so much that could be fixed. There's way too many hackers in this game and the developer's just made an automatic ban system to ban the hacks that are known to the system.   Also let's say that you've played 6 missions in a row, won them all, great stats &amp; all that. Your next mission can cause you to quit the game entirely because of bullsh!t game mechanics killing you, enemy team teaming up and playing the game way too competitive or just get tickled to death by a nano or whatever.   I've had so much fun in this game but now it's just like tip of a pen that's running out of ink. No more ink = No more fun.  I wouldn't recommend this game to any of my friends unless they've played it and can handle or have experienced utter sh!t mechanics f*cking you over and over again.  If there wasn't any customization in this game i would've never spent all the hours that i have now.
3938	0	a	Doesn't feel finished, unfinished, pay to win, crap. Save yourself the disk space, unless you're really desparate.
672	1	a	well i haven't play this game before but i watched it on youtube and go type the channel who make the apb reloaded video is rapid99apb police chase on youtube type it there and you can like talk to people make friends shoot enemies and all that kind of stuff you can drive all the day's work of san paro and you can shoot criminials i must have said it already but oh well thats the support i need bye
3248	1	a	This game rocks. There isn't a better free play game out there
10414	1	a	this game is amazing it is really fun to play with friends or solo.The map is big so you wont get bored of your suroundings and there are always missions to do .The combat engine is realy good and it runs smoothly(even a laptop can run it)i would highly recommend this awesome game:D
3437	1	a	although my email doesn`t work for some reason the gameplay is pretty good
950	1	a	Love this game, Just starting the game up, with the very broken launcher, to get in a server full of hackers/cheaters it not the best thing to come into when you have spend like half hour fixing the launcher :s
3304	1	a	Go ahead punk, make my d- OH GOD HE'S PAYING TO WIN, HELP!
6447	0	a	Boreing game better off playing with barney and friends poor pc peasants still have no games 2 play , no wonder its a free lol.
10695	1	a	This game has gone through VERY BIG rough patches with Kabam. However DECA games brings hope to ROTMG to show this game's full potential. Very excited to see what happens.
8105	0	a	Bunch of greedy developers with no support for it's community.
6292	0	a	For those looking for a pay2win version of saints row 2, then APB is your goto. Otherwise just play GTAonline. Or keep moving along.
8591	0	a	Boring
7089	0	a	So bugged game, first black screen loading at begginning , second so much lagging but i have a good pc to play it ....
6613	0	a	It is almost impossible to kill someone with the first level guns, It takes 30 hits from the 1st rifle in the game to kill someone. Then you get blown away with shotguns and more powerful weapons. This is a pay to win game. I played for a day, and it was mostly dying.....
1709	1	a	Great vigilante vs. criminal game, brings you lots of fun, can be confusing in the start but will bring many hours of joy!
4714	0	a	This is pretty much just a poor man's GTA Online.
2798	1	a	I play this game when I want the flood of hackers to punish me.
4412	0	a	Great game, horrible company. Don't trust your wallet and time with these guys, they have banned a lot of good people for doing absolutely nothing. Also, there is only one dev assigned to working on the game, so nothing is getting updated, ever (except for those $50 re-skinned guns that seem to come out every week).
9423	1	a	It's a really fun game and it's kind of like fallout because you can roam around and collect items 
10410	1	a	Coolest Post-Apocalyptic Game,Even If The Only, Game I Have Ever Played. 9.7/10
7681	0	a	I am not able to play this game.Every time i try to play it i press start and it doesn't load the game. My friend has the same problem.I am really disapointed. ;{
10379	0	a	Remove the verification that's what makes so much people hate your game so yea I deam it un-playable
5654	0	a	If you like getting camped by rocket launchers straight out of spawn. This is the game for you.
2733	1	a	Nice game, i've been playing as a criminal
9189	1	a	play this game not because it's fun but because I say so.
7758	0	a	there's to much lag. It sucks.
1830	1	a	This game is quite a very fun game with awesome groups,weapons,vehicles and more! 9.5/10
9604	0	a	maximum range of assualt rifle is 40meter.... you got sniper rifle? thats 70meter... i quit it and never come back 
10060	1	a	HELL YEAH!! It's a very awesome combination of MM and FPS, the big world is amazing, the way every looks and feels around you is amazing!
498	1	a	fix the severe lag issues and it would be a lot better n.n
2989	1	a	The game is extremely difficult to get good at. Hackers are easy to spot. Just dont take it too seriously.
4916	0	a	Very laggy not worth trying it... Also maid my laptop frezz and gave it bugs
6216	0	a	With GTA V Online, this game is more redundant than ever before.
4253	0	a	worst game ever,toxic community of â¥â¥â¥â¥ups
6356	0	a	Ok, I am going to be 100% fair on this review. If you don't want to read a lot in short don't buy it scam is being nice when talking about this game.  First, the Good. The game was a fantastic idea and subject. The customization level is super.  Where it starts going down hill is there is no way to deal with issues like people interfering or cheating in other people's missions. An example you are driving away in a vehicle to protect someone and the opposing team ask friends not in the mission to ram your car and pin you in a location. you have no ability to retaliate it would be better or more fair if you could at least shoot back and kill the drivers of such cars as a deterrent. The most you get is a report system which no one ever gets kicked from that I can tell after all there is no real way for them to tell what went on and they really want to keep money coming in.  Then it gets worse than the rampant cheating and hacking crap.  Anything good in the game is going to cost you real world cash through G1C which is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing rip off to hell at 400 for 5.00 considering what you get in return compared to even other games. At least most real world currency systems are a penny or less per credit.  The other option is joker credits which you can earn at a healthy 10,000 in about 2 months.  Then there is no real balance to the game you will be continually put up against people who either have â¥â¥â¥â¥ loads of real world cash to throw away on good weapons and crap or you will be put against people with enough level to make it pointless.  A company that actually gave to â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ about the users and the experience wouldn't be selling better weapons for real cash. You would find stuff that doesn't actually effect performance for sale. You can see this in countless game be it CS:GO or planet side anything you can pay for you can earn in game.
7514	0	a	One of the worst games on steam.
4373	0	a	MM sucks, server lags most of the time.
4337	0	a	Pay to win, as a noob you cant do â¥â¥â¥â¥ with the basic weapons you're given and you always get rekt by neckbeard players with OP weapons. Also theres no hit boxes, even if you shoot someone on the head it doesn't do more damage
2883	1	a	I've been playing APB reloaded for about 100+hours so far its not that bad i find it quiet fun, if you arent that skilled it could be a complain on match making, im alright with this since i usually get 2k score rating im inbetween gold/silver ranking. To me its not bad at all nothing wrong with it, yes some weapons are OP in Weapon shop which could be considered Pay to win, but i found after i get upgraded stock weapons that usually comes to Tactics and which weapon is equiped but mostly on tactic it self, i killed and won over many Pay to wins.   To me try it out see how it goes dont give up so fast, you must be pretty good at games like a proper 'gamer' good with progression, people who have just started gaming or havent played much of these type of games would find this game abit challenging. How you tell your doing any good is if your getting better scores they do and over 1k score rating and going up most matches, winning.etc barely dieing. those type of things.  Give it a shot, if your good with it its never a problem with match making at all Also adding - stock weapons are pretty good, i still own golds and silvers with it, not really your weapon, tactic/dodge.etc is the aim i do, i even try crouching time to time. Also a tip you should see if they have any perks like Blood clotting and more armor on them selfs, and change your tactic towards that 1 person, usually for the more armored and slow, i usually fire abit and hit them and reload as quick as possible, then full on kill them with the means to kill them.   Also dont go to Hong Kong server as it isnt in 'hong kong' its more in USA side, also it doesnt have many people in it. so i disagree ever going that server. Give it a shot Gamer!
7639	0	a	Accumlated 3.5k hours on this game. It's garbage, dont do it.
7070	0	a	Already dead, both gameplay and community, but still trying to breathe and bring back its former days. 3/10
4513	0	a	this game is like crack. I know its â¥â¥â¥â¥ but god damn do i keep coming back to it for some reason. if you have played over 300 hours then yea your good. if your new get out while you can. this game sucks so hard with the servers lagging you out nearly eery 5 minutes. seriously though gave me some great memories and freinds but jesus is it awful. the best part is the customization because it makes gta and saints row customization look like all you can do is simply change if you have a mustache or not.
3513	1	a	Wanna have ultimate character customization in a game in which no one gives a got damn â¥â¥â¥â¥ about it? Here ya go.  
10622	0	a	Kabam rigged this like a demolitions expert. Let me elaborate. This was a nice local resturant, with a speciality meal hardly seen before. It was a mix of rogue-like and bullet hell. There were bullets everywhere and if you couldn't handle the heat, it was back to the start. But starting over isn't all bad. You got fame, a currency that could be used on goods to get yourself running hotter. You could also unlock new classes for a spin on the taste. It was a nice resturant, filled with a jovial atmosphere. But then the owner handed it over to a rather greedy man. Now it is a pit of money and shame, filled with people looking to scam and the food reminicent of a fast food resturant. Nobody was happy, but the owners.
5430	0	a	kinnda like gta but with more customization
9979	0	a	All the makings of a great game in a not great game!  Oh well, at least I didn't pay for it.
10543	0	a	Pretty good for uninstalling.
6798	0	a	A great game with a super awesome amount of customization. However the pay-2-win model ruins most the game.
644	1	a	Really fun for a free game.
5694	0	a	The game seems good when you first play it, but slowly turns into you needing microtransactions to get better gear and personalisation options, seems like the game would be better if they were not trying to steal your money constantly.
10138	1	a	Hands down, one of my all time favorite game, and the only game that I ever addict to. Maybe it's because I started playing a week before summer start, but I still played 480 hours or 20 days in one summer... lol
8214	0	a	somethings wrong with it. wont let me get on or make an account
6712	0	a	+ Fun game  - Pay to win - Bugs - Lots of cheaters - Server wide lag on a weekly basis for multiple days
7578	0	a	I cant believe i even came back to this Pay To Win kind of game.   Never again.
6381	0	a	Fun and all but it takes time to play and some people dont have time
7625	0	a	Take this from a guy who has played this game for 200 hours.  I started playing this game shortly after i became free to play in 2011 and I liked it. I played with my friends and they also liked it. But then I started noticing it had problems.  Graphics: It's graphics are okay and to be expected of a free to play game that was originaly created in 2010 but nothing to be amazed of.  The guns: For some reason the creators think people want a bilion guns to choose from, it's fine they excist but it ruins the came that they are so much better and you HAVE to spent real money on the REALLY good guns. Ruins it.  Gameplay: It depens, if you have a team of good players and you play against some fair people it's a great gameplay you have but that allmost never happens. Often you play against some scumbags who is premium and have bought a premium snipergun that oneshot's you. That is was ruin your game.  I can't really recommend it, yes I have enjoyed it but no, it's not worth it.
7707	0	a	Graphics are good but its a complicated game u need 1 month or 2 to completely understand this game or complete training period.Go for dota 2,phantom recon ghost,team fortress or ghost multiplayer. ~Cheers
9064	1	a	I love Fallout. Well, I loved Fallout 3. I didnt get into the others so much but the post nuclear/disaster/world gone to â¥â¥â¥â¥ scenario called out to me. When I first stumbgled into this game in 2009 I was overjoyed that someone had the brains to bring the MMO world a new change. One that didn't invole swords or spells or people running around yelling ' you're not holding the aggro ya nooob'.  Thats what this game is. Simply put it's the best MMO I have ever played. Quite string terminology I know but let me tell you why.   Moderated help chat. This is a key in any game that people are new to and I think should be a staple in ANY MMO. The GM's are friendly but also help you when you need it.   Crafting. I have honestly never played a game with better crafting. Literally everything you can think of can be made. Want a shirt? Craft it. Need new shoes or pants? Craft them. I've heard some people say SWG had the best crafting system but I didnt play it so I cant comment.  The classless system. This in my book is a bonus. You can be whoever you want. Want a guy that beats the crap out of things with a 2x4 and shoots pistols? Thats ok. A lot of people get confused by now having a rigid class to stick to but I think its a breath of fresh air.   Ok so the graphics might be a bit outdated and theres constant bugs but the heart is there. Not many people are playing it these days but theres still enough people to make a game out of it. My only dissapointment is that Icarus studios sold it. A lot of people grumbled about the micro tranasctions but in my opinion you either buy them or you dont.  Anyways if you like fallout then I think you should enjoy this. Plus its free to play now so if you dont like it it wont cost you anything :) Its the closest to the fallout MMO your going to get for a while.  
3527	1	a	Amazing PvP and GTA like style with a lot of customization.
10234	1	a	looks like a promising game ill have to look at it after i start playing it tho
2257	1	a	i love this game although its really hard to understand and master i recommend for skilled players and people who can aim very well using a mouse
5032	0	a	Great game, looks attractive, nice gameplay and such.. But ehh.. Doesn't really want to run.. So...ehhh.. Yeah..
6313	0	a	a â¥â¥â¥â¥ version of gta online
8170	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. Fun with friends. (sometimes)
172	1	a	Pros - Customizability. Yes there is a limit when you have a free acount when it comes to decals on cars and clothes but it is still a lot that you can fo.  - Getting together with friends. APB is quite a lot of fun with a lot of friends and you just mess around the entire time  -Gameplay. Even though many people find it repititive i still found it quite enjoyable to play and I think have logged something like 200/300 hours into this game.   Cons: -Terrible servers -Terrible developers  - Hackers. Hackers everywhere.
8945	1	a	Time of your life.
2838	1	a	Played it for awhile too like planet side 2 but i dont understand such a thing O.O the Vehicle control really hard to learn.. and its fun never tried playing like police or something
6654	0	a	dont get this. here is what you should get instead from best to worst: 1) GTA V 2) GTA IV 3) Saints Row 3 4) Saints Row 4 5) GTA San Andreas 6) GTA 3 7) GTA Vice City 8) Saints Row Gat Out Of Hell 9) Just Cause 2 10) Just Cause 3 11) Goat Simulator 12) Borderlands 2 13) APB Reloaded this game is not wroth your time. it is a very nice games but so many other open world games are just so much better with so much more content.
5162	0	a	'lol what's a launcher? what's a registry? lol steam thinks you played it while i crahsed lololol' -The Game's Launcher  I wanted to play this game, since I thought it was a free alternitive to GTA V or something like that, so I got it, and installed the assets. When I clicked played, it gave me an error saying that the game could not load itself into the Windows Registry, then it quitted. Then I relaunched it. Stuck at the splash screen. Launched it again, at the launcher, clicked Play, it just quits, Steam does not register it as a crash, but a 'You played a game!' sort of deal. So I just gave up. Hopefully they will fix it.
3607	1	a	
1294	1	a	I have been playing this game for a very long time now. It is fast paced, open world and really fun. The character customization is amazing, and makes the game so much more fun. I play on both teams, enforcer and criminal. They both got their pro's and con's but they both have their own playstyle to it. I would recommend this to anyone that likes openworld RPG kind of games.
7442	0	a	Menus are messy, quests are hard, very pay to win, and hard to understand what youre doing.
9731	1	a	BOUT TIME DEM NERD NIKKAZ MAKE A GAME BOUT MUH HOOD DETROIT REPRE$ENT.
9051	1	a	Post-Apocalyptic MMO . . can't get any better then this. A bit slow to level but good world size.
2176	1	a	I really good PvP MMO but the vehicle controls are crap...  It feels like you are driving a boat not a car :(
5067	0	a	Might be a good game if it actually friggin did something when you clicked start, super awesome.
10794	1	a	good for wasting an hour once in a while.
8166	0	a	I've put a few weeks into this game.  The missions are good and varied. The customization is pretty decent as well. Though, a LOT of customization options are behind a pay wall in the ARMAS marketplace, which is overpriced as â¥â¥â¥â¥. The combat comes down to gear. The Meta is spam and pray. SMGs, Assault Rifles, RPGs, and grenades. Being outgeared is a common issue. If one person has a better gun than the rest of your team your team is â¥â¥â¥â¥ed. Hit detection isn't pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥, getting hit behind walls and cars is common.  I wouldn't recommend this game for anything but the customization. That's the best part of this game, and it's a grind to get anything worth customizing.
1811	1	a	game is great alternertive to other action games like gta 5 but the problem i hate the most is the lag n to op weapons
4385	0	a	Came back to this game for the third time and its still the only game i most disrecommend , hey devs how about you use this game to wipe your asses when you finish polishing it which is never going to happen.
7034	0	a	Never spend money on a free game. If you download this, you'll either have to buy your gear or spend hundreds of hours trying to keep up with the frequent spenders.  This game is realy just fun for the moment, not a long term game.
10647	1	a	i like the sounds
3966	0	a	This game, is an ok game to be free to play, good weapons, outfits, vehicles, missions, all of that is good. But I have to say, this game is just too overated.
10028	1	a	epic game with huge open world worth playing
4549	0	a	I can safely say, that this is one of the games that fall into the horrible 'pay to win' category. The player that pays for advanced weapons and equipment put you at a disadvantage. However, it is still possible to kill them if you know what you're doing and you work well with your team mates. If you're a casual fps player, I'd look at another game, unless you're able to learn from getting killed over and over by pay to win players. If you have some skill at fps games, this should be no problem.  Putting the whole 'pay to win' discussion aside, this is just a mediocre game at best. Everything is rather reptitive. If you're a criminal, you steal items for money or fight enforcers. If you're an enforcer you can catch criminals in the act and/or fight them. It's rather boring. The map is horribly small; you'll have seen and explored everything on your first play through. Therefore, you're losing out on the whole 'discovery' aspect of many successful games.  This games works in two parts. There is the explorable mode and the mission mode. While not on any missions you are unable to fight anyone. While you're in a mission, you can't kill anyone else but your targets. There are two issues with this: 1) If you come online and want to join your friend in a mission, you can't. You are unable to help kill their opposition. 2) If you're in a mission, a person outside the mission can thwart you by ramming your car, blocking your path, and being the eyes of the enemy team. You are unable to kill them. They are a ghost.  If you're going to play game as a solo player, just don't. You'll be so bored, so fast. You'll become frustrated easily from losing over and over. Players in this game are rather bad, so expect your team mates to play horribly. However, if you're going to play with friends, this game will give you some entertainment value.  This game gets a 2/10 for being some what fun if you play with friends. Regardless, this game is not worth picking up.  
1945	1	a	NOTE: I have over 400 or so hours logged in this game on another launcher previous to me joining steam.  I will not recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a fair fight. I will not recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a friendly player-base. I will not recommend this game to anyone who wants to fight simple AI without challenge. I will not recommend this game to anyone who does not have a lot of spare time. I will not recommend this game to anyone who cannot deal with â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t GMs or Devs I will not recommend this game to anyone who has an anger problem.  I WILL recommend this game to any and ALL video-game masochists and sadists alike!  Pros +GREAT Customization +There ARE 'good' players here. +This game does NOT hold your hand.  Cons -Old players are mostly â¥â¥â¥â¥-heads. -â¥â¥â¥â¥ Dev Team -â¥â¥â¥â¥ GMs -Could do with less 'cash pay' bull-â¥â¥â¥â¥. -Needs a genuine player base -Stop catering to â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s.  Thank you for your time in reading, this game really had some serious potential! It was marketed properly, it played very well when I was in, but now the reviews I see are far beyond disappointing. Clean up your act APB, you're like the boxer a child roots for until he crashes his car into a school bus full of gifted and talented children.
1068	1	a	This game could have been amazing, its got all the elements. Only problem is there weren't any significant updates after the game changed companies. It has it's share of problems such as cheaters, slight buy to win edge, lots of ram needed to play. However for its price (free) its an excellent game to kill time and the gameplay itself is great, best online 3rd person shooter ever. Also so much customization, cars, characters, clothes, music. Maybe one day a worthy company will pick this one up and improve upon the concept. Until then I'll kill enforcers. Over and over.
3909	0	a	Unoptimized, full of bugs, pay2win weapons, community made of try hard teenagers.  Waste of your time. Don't play this game.
1770	1	a	This game is fab. Better than all Grand Theft Autos!
3434	1	a	 Gameplay
10075	1	a	I first played this game back in 2012. I Really liked that you can do whatever you want. Do quests, grind and loot all day, craft new stuff, or just have fun in PvP. Fallen Earth reminds you of Fallout 3 and S.T.A.L.K.E.R. alot, so if you're into any of those games you will most likely enjoy playing Fallen Earth.   The game sadly turned more and more into a Pay 2 Win game after the 2.4 patch. However, you can still enjoy most features without doing any payments, yet it takes longer time for you.  The community is very friendly and extremely helpful if you've got some questions.
9616	0	a	worst game ive ever played
4665	0	a	Great game but horrible support and company behind it.
7335	0	a	On this game, you get to customize your character the way YOU want to, maybe not to specific but yo can get damn close, plus the Action in it is fun, just try and avoid the cheaters when possible  ***NEW NOTE*** over the years playing it now, i lost all taste in the game, its rather bad and just plain garbage, i regret spending money on this now other than to just customize my characters.
222	1	a	This is a great game, With the latest set of updates and monitoring of the servers you feel like your playing for fun and not to outdue questionable players. This game is a great catch if your looking for some serious customization of your ride, character and Weapons. Able to customize to your hearts delight with logos, paterns and the like, this is a fast paced game that brings out the best and worst in people. out of 5 stars i give it a 4
6	1	a	- Spent my mom's money in Armas marketplace. - Bought a VAS-C2 'Trouble Maker'. - Went into game, got in a mission. - Closed my eyes, held the left mouse button.  Went from bronze to gold and now R255.  10/10
3205	1	a	Very well made game and also can be extremely addictive,there will be a little lag now and then but its acceptable and not to bad
10687	1	a	Don't play this game
4351	0	a	this game susks â¥â¥â¥â¥ and the game runs wores than a fat chick runing a 50mil long track
9985	1	a	i recommend it. 1.) free. 2.) its fun and interesting. 3.) it gives you a fallout feel that will also get rid of all your fallout withdrawels. ok. so seriously. not pay to win/play/or even look. its free. feels wierd in a way but it also plays smoothly for jus about any pc. i personaly like this game. it reminds me of fallout 3 with a touch.
2940	1	a	onlion GTA?
895	1	a	I do enjoy this game. Many people comment upon the fact that the game was spoiled. I agree with this statement to an extent. For the first couple of week playing the game, It's extremely fun, But after a while it become repetitive and boring, but this is after a long time.   Pay To Win:  This game as covered in pay to win items, but this is understandable since it is a f2p game. Anything that you can buy with money, you can earn legit through hard work in-game. So its just really booster packs. The only exceptions to this is apparel and vehicles. Some of the best weapons in the game you can simply buy on the in-game marketplace with in-game money.   Team Balancing:  Team balancing is horrendous. I have had experiences of being on a team with bronze threats (2nd lowest threat level, I'm a silver), And been against a team of gold threats. The reason this occurs is due to the fact that the punishment for gold threats playing on a silver threat server is next to nothing. This is an easy way for gold threats to play, because they are against silvers and bronzes. And they are not getting punished for doing so. Due to this, The gold threat servers are gathering dust.   Enforcers VS Criminal:    Enforcers have a MASSIVE advantage over Criminals, E.G.:   Having the ability to arrest us, and then kill us (because the penalty for doing so is next to non-existent)   Having all of the apb veterans on their side, This is a massive issue.    Repetitive:  Apb has got repetitive, I mean like.. Stressfully repetitive. Players are forced to grind for weeks, playing every single day of the week to be able to catch up to the opposite teams. They are forced to do the same thing over and over and over again. This is one of the main reasons I don't really play this game anymore.    Conclusion:  In conclusion, despite what I have said, I would recommend this game to a very specific audience. That audience would be:   Willing to spend quite allot of money on a game.   Willing to grind for weeks on end   Willing to do the same thing over and over again   Willing to enjoy something like this   Willing to put up with the unfair team balancing   -TheKillerToaster
7788	0	a	just another P2W, being a criminal in real life it's cheaper than this laggy game full of aimboter players, so go on and use those $10000 that you're paying for this game and use them for a real gun.
194	1	a	A periodically over-the-top aggressive game but otherwise quite fun. It's a little hard to compare it to other games as for its mechanics in depth are quite diverse. Driving is sort of weird and could be compared to ice skating. Shooting in-game is pretty fun but yet again, hard to compare it to another game. Graphics are a bit out of date but hey, this game was made a while ago. Its freeroam and mission based PvP servers are nice while having servers with open PvP have their perks too  Unfortunately this is one of those P2P or P2W kind of games but its really fun gameplay no matter if you pay money or not.  All in all, I would suggest this game to anyway who likes choosing what side of the law they want to help (by help I mean shooting at people your told to shoot at.)
5807	0	a	trying ot get it to work the struggle is real
711	1	a	Not a bad game

8488	0	a	it's quite fun but...   its kinda pay to win~
6941	0	a	Would you stick your tongue as deep as you could possibly reach inside the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ of a woman who has been used as the city's sperm dumpster? If you answered 'Yes', then by all means, play this game.
5796	0	a	The game would always launch but the game would never actually start up, yet Steam would say it was running.
1925	1	a	Great free 3rd person shooter. Community isn't the best in my opinion, but still tons of fun, especially with friends!
3491	1	a	The has its problems, but what game doesn't. Overall a fun experince
2656	1	a	It's the multiplayer version of cops and robbers you've always wanted. It almost feels like it's pay to win, but it totally isn't.
5485	0	a	+Good game for fans of Saints Row and GTA +Nice graphics  +Awesome music  -Launcher is bugged its never turn of untill restart Steam -Keep counting hours spend in game even if not playing it -Classic P2W -Can't delete account even if you ask support
10274	0	a	If you like fallout this game will be for you. A bad thing about it thougs is the crearing an account i have created an account and it wont let me log in after first time playing it. If the account creating was a bit better i would play more but untill this gets sorted i will not be playin this game again
8340	0	a	we need more dolton fresnow parts
4858	0	a	Dare devs, â¥â¥â¥â¥ you... this game was awsome, i stoped for a bit because of work, and i come back and i start it up, and after teh update guess what i get. Instead of it runnig like it did, it says my video card is not compatible. Even though it wroked fine 2 months ago. again â¥â¥â¥â¥ you 
936	1	a	^_^
2219	1	a	Good game guys. Play tutorial, finish your task and get ready for action.  Note: If Punkbuster kick your â¥â¥â¥, go here and download:  http://www.punkbuster.com/index.php?page=pbsetup.php   Then find APB Reloaded and update it (with Punkbuster).
7658	0	a	Nope nope nopeeee :D but i could be bais, there was too much lag for me to play it :) be cool if there was an australian server :)
7690	0	a	its a really fun game, the world is expansive and you can customize the music, cars, clothes and many other things which is a pretty big plus.. but no matter how hard you work, its very oriented toward people who buy stuff in game, no matter how hard you worked for that machine gun by doing missions, you only get it for maybe a few days or a week, but if you buy it, its yours for good.  but ig your ok with that then this is your game, but I myself hate when someone a lower level blows me to bits with a machine gun and leaves me in the dust using a muscle car that goes double my speed, making it a quickly ending speed chase.  and even though it says I only played for an hour or so, I've had days of playing this game before I had it on steam, sad the say that it hasnt changed.
3695	1	a	Decent game, kind of pay to win but most weapons that you buy are just the same weapons you start with you have but reskinned. Lot's of customization and fun to play with friends and you can just absolutely â¥â¥â¥â¥ around.         9.5/10 kill more crims
8820	0	a	This game is unbalanced as f*ck!
5630	0	a	Pay to win game
3567	1	a	Absolute garbage.  This game is the tale of pay to win tryhards vs. trolls who do not give a â¥â¥â¥â¥, and with hundreds of customization options under your belt, trolling could never be easier. Nothing quite as satisfying as running over an anime pay2win roleplayer with your â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ car plastered with the image of a â¥â¥â¥â¥ on the hood.  It's fun to an extent but don't expect depth unless you've got hundreds to spend.
7057	0	a	the game says p2w guns aren't more powerful then f2p guns (well lets see) p2w side one shot dead half a map away dead cars driving at 900 mph dead f2p side stand at somone shooting them multiple times he has same weapon we empty our clips me barley killing him car drives at 2 mph car blows up from two crashes then im ran over then one shot by a pay to winner have tactical adventage shot him 4 times he turns around casuly killing me  yea defintly f2p here guys 0/10
10372	0	a	overall boring and difficult to really get into, the FPS elements are there but just not nearly refined enough to really attract a serious fan base other than people who have awesome computers to run it at maximum..With the release of it on Steam the bugs and server issues have gotten much much worse, and lag and really low Frame rates is more than common. Generally i give this game a 4/10 good idea, good back ground, great presentation, but poor game play, and â¥â¥â¥â¥ poor mechanics
4935	0	a	So full of W2P items and hackers.  People were openly talking in general chat, about how there are only two ways of enjoying this game:  And i quote directly: 'There are two ways of enjoying this game, either you spend money in the Armas store, or you spend money on hacks'   Enough said.
2660	1	a	Best F2P shooter, despite the ongoing server issues and the 'youthful spirited' community.
5732	0	a	Well, the 1 hour I spent on this game was when it was loading.   10/10 would uninstall again
3311	1	a	Excellent FTP game that is fun to play with friends or just when bored. Downside is the lag that you may sometimes experience from this games heavy usage. Other than that this game is truelly amazing for being free.
6655	0	a	Im going to be honest: this didn't even make the mark for my expectations. What i was advertised was a Saints Row-type game with crazy gang wars and awesome gameplay. What i got was a clunky game that put more effort into its amazing character customization than the actual gameplay. It's just all over the place and not even Tobuscus could somehow make it better.
1888	1	a	'The best part of this game is not just the shooting and guarding the objective.' The best part of this game is that god gaben made the uninstall button as bright as the game and easy to find than finding a bloody opponent    see the 2.2 hour i wasted on that game? it takes that long to be diagnosed with brain cancer   
4533	0	a	Hackers, Server lag and much more has spoilt this once marvellous game. Don't just take my word for it, even other veterans with over 1000 hours will tell you the same.
7094	0	a	i cant start the games and i also cant play  
2295	1	a	Really fun
71	1	a	never played it but here is my review
10166	1	a	great game to pass the time fun but hard to get anywhere and really hard to find friends
8962	1	a	I played this game on and off for the last few years. Sure its pretty dated but it holds together well.   It's really in its on niche at times, but it's still great.   It's not exactly a causal game or regular player game. It just depends on what you want to do, because the world and its missions are are pretty open.   It's worth trying at least once.      
9323	1	a	Its k
1439	1	a	It don't know where to start... As I have been playing APB:Reloaded since the open beta in 2011, I came up with many things that are very good and some that are pretty horrendous.  First the pros to this game: -the best customization system I've ever seen in a game -a challenging progression curve IF you endure, but very fun -good gameplay with depth in it -replayability  And now some cons which I will go into further than into the pros: -very slow development(we are waiting for more than two years now for the engine update, nothing special was implented during that time except a new car...) -unbelievably expensive prices in the cash store(sometimes about 10â¬ for just a cosmetic item. You are more or less forced to pay something for this game to really be able to play it. For example, the customization is restricted for free players and you can only use it to its fullest when you have a premium membership. Though, it is pretty regular that codes for premium membership are given away)   In Overall, the game is very good and you will have your fun with it IF you are willing to get used to the gameplay and invest some money into it(about the amount of a AAA-game).
9151	1	a	This game is a very fun game to play despite a few glitches sometimes but I would definately recommend this! &lt;3
2910	1	a	Pretty Decent Game.
7813	0	a	I ignored APB for a long time, but due to a lack of other games I tried it. Generally, it is a solid Multiplayer PVP Game and makes fun for a short period time, but it has too many negative aspects in my opinion.  Pro's:  -Kind of GTA online clone.  -You can play and level Cops and Criminals.  -The design option is very big and funny. You can spend hours creating Vehicles, Style etc.  -Nice Cities with good spots and nice surroundings.  Con's: -As always in such games there is a ton of aimbot users most on criminal side in my opinion, wich ruins balancing totally in many missions. -Missions get very boring after a couple of days, cause they are always the same. Its only 4-5 different mission types on each side. -Most of the random players are not cooperative and not playing in team. They dont use chat and running like chickens into the other teams. Very frustrating when you have highlevel players and premade teams against you.  -For such a little online game it has way too many lags, what makes combat sometimes too stressy.  -The loading time is way too long. It needs up to 5 min. to get into the game, and you can not do anything else at this time cause the launcher makes your saystem slow, otherwise the game crashes. Thats not a resource problem its the simple game client.  -BUT Worst thing is the Pay to win! faction. Get better guns and bonuses from the shop or get 50% more than all other players. WTF...Without premium this game is nearly not playable. For example with premium I did level 4 Factions in one day to max, without it I did not even get one of them two levels up and got so much less money, that I can't get any better weapons.   After a week of playing alone and with freinds, I can only say...In the end you have to do frustrating and boring Mission farming....the design option is funny and fight can be thrilling sometimes, but after a couple of missions even that doesnt make it better. And thats the point where I stop playing such games.  If you like playing games where free to play means 'Counter strike' with frustrating and boring farming 80% of the time, and if its not bother you that a game has so many aimbot players, try it, otherwise leave it be and do something better with your time.     
8994	1	a	Interesting MMO game produced by GamerFirst Live, this game is really interesting and functionable there are many things that i havent seen yet but some games have the same capability to have same functions.. this game is really based off Fallout: 3 / Fallout: New Vegas.. I have played this game up to 37 level, and also with my other character up to 17.. i started to play this game 2011 so i have experience in this game so yeah i guess il be rating this game 5/5.  Warm Regards, MikeN
9910	1	a	I totally recommend this game. i know like most free to play MMO's there is a cap on what you can do with the free account but its not low enough to really bother you. I personally like the crafting in the game. i like the fact that you can find nearly everything you need in the open world or collecting it from things/people you killed. Most of the players are really friendly and willing to help! I do think that the tutorial should maybe be a little longer as i dont think that it really explains enough to understand the game when you enter the world. I also love the fact that you get to craft vehicles for transport. The fact that the map is sooooooooooooooooo big i mean its huge. AWESOME game. One of my FAVS!!!!!! I really dont think i have come across anything that i dont like about it :) 10/10
9790	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥, I CAN WRITE A RIVEW , WELL â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥ ASS GAME 0/10

Most games is press E, Crappy dailog box(it glitches...), Crappy skills.  Well, if ou like that crap ^^^ then this game, still isnt for you... its really that bad, don't play this game.
2787	1	a	Loads of things to do
3749	0	a	After having played this game for 3 years and put over 1000 hours into it. I can say for certain that this game is a fundamentally flawed broken unfinished piece of sh!t, no one wants to play this game and FOR A GOOD REASON.  Apb has a huge potential to be something great, It has the hands down best customization any game ever made has to offer. You can create your own cars and clothing and truely be anything you want to be with little limitation. But on the gameplay side of things, while the the idea behind the gameplay and the missions and all that stuff is solid, the fundamental design flaws prevents it from living up to that potential. On top of that, the game is littered with many bugs, imbalances and, serious client side and crippling server side performance issues. And most importantly, this game attracts and empowers a lot of duchebags to do maximum duchebaggery, they are like the soul of APB (and not in a good way)  So what are these fundamental game design flaws?  Map designs that do not take into account what this game is about and how it is played, players love exploiting the flawed map designs to cheat the mission by placing items on high up unreachable places and obstructing or destroying the only way to get there, making the whole mission invalid and granting them an automatic win. Or putting the item in a car and circumvent the speed penalty for doing so by just pushing the car with another car and driving on the part of the map that is impossible to intercept.  Mission designs that give no consideration to the locations or nonsensical objectives that dont take into consideration the nature of the game. For example, investigating an ATM in a middle of an open 80-150m space with no cover and surrounded by sniping positions. Or pointless objectives that are impossible for one of the teams to do, like stopping a car from going through 3 unspecified checkpoints on random locations on the map. Some mission objectives are placed in locations that greatly favor one of the teams.   Almost all missions in this game require you to camp the objective, the whole game is based on camping and some combinations of map locations and mission objectives make it impossible to finish some missions because the enemy team is camping some roof top that has only one way up with guns pointed at it and is too high to be sniped.  Theres also weapons that dont belong in this game, Such as the OSMAW rocket launcher that makes any semblance of a balance in this game, hit rock bottom.  No one will ever fight fair, they will use every dirty trick in the book, any given opportunity to cheat the mission and will have no mercy for your rank 25 noob as.s.  They will be rude and obnoxious about it, they will message you without provocation just to insult you during or after the mission when they won it. The forum community is just as rotten.  I also have to mention the broken matchmaking that throws low level beginner players against high level duchebags that have unlocked every possible balance breaking gear and know every possible game exploit and are not ashamed to use all that to stomp the low level new players that dont have jack sh!t unlocked. The more game breaking gear is, the higher level locked it is, making sure that people who dont need it to win the mission have it and people who could really use it dont, witch tips the scales to a 90 angle between both sides.   If you have no job and live in your mom's basement, even you will find this game to be the biggest grind fest ever conceived, if you do not have a sh!t bucket nearby, this game is not for you. Even with premium, be prepared to put at least 400 hours to get on a level playing field with the rest of the players or your as.s will be stomped every mission you do. You will get 90% grind and 10% actual enjoyment before you get to a point where you have all the necessary gear unlocked and can start playing the game just for fun.  If all of this wasnt enough, G1' is 'working hard' to add all kinds of new and exciting ways to be an as.shole in the game. Such as the 'car surfer' character mod that allows your character to ride on top of a car and fire any bul.lsh!t weapon you want at your opposition who is chasing you and blowing up their car, eliminating every little remaining chance for the enemy team to get their hands on that item you are running away with like a pus.sy instead of fighting, throwing out the last remaining bit of fairness and balance out the window and ensuring the victory for your team.  A car surfing OSMAW as.shole on top of a car with other cowboy hat duchebags is like a cherry on top of a stinking sh!t cake. It is the symbol of everything that is wrong with this game.  i also forgot to mention, the gun play is a joke, there is no proper bullet collisions with map objects, making you hit invisible forcefields and random objects you arent even aiming at, your weapons lock up and dont shoot if you pressed shoot a tiny bit too soon after you finished climbing a ladder or getting out of the car. There is no such thing as hitboxes for body parts or headshots or any of that modern stuff, the whole player is one big hitbox (usualy bigger than the player model so they can kill you without even touching you. The servers run on a 40ms (ideal conditions - also never) tick rate that effects the gun play, and other aspects of the game. This means things only happen every 40ms, you can feel this delay the most when you are driving a car or pressing F to do an action, you can also see the shots you fired at lets say a car, hit it after some delay. This is kind of a problem to the gun play, you get the kill or not depends a lot not on your skill but on factors like if your shots are at the beginning or the end of that 40ms gap, witch is also greatly effected by crippling server side lag issues. It also seems that some people are favored by the server over others, they are so called lag armor users or people that kill you faster than the max fire rate of the weapon they are using. Its different from person to person, i guess the server somehow lines up people in a specific order when it processes information coming from them. There is also a big problem called ghost shots, its when you shoot but for whatever reason the server doesnt register any of your shots.  So yeah, this game is a really good idea, but the execution is terrible, dont waste your time unless you are a masochist like me.  TL;DR  Serious client side performance issues and crippling server side performance and bugs. Maps designed for the wrong game. Missions placed blindly, not taking location consideration or what game this even is. Rude community, especially on the forums. Camping, Using exploits, taking advantage of the fundamental design flaws and other kinds of cheating to win missions. This game is 10% fun and 90% frustrating grind. Balance breaking Weapons that do not belong in this type of game.
3404	1	a	Cool game for going all out against hordes of cops/criminals. Also, very good customization options, I recommend. 
6764	0	a	Game becomes a trollfest regardless of which side you pick. Can be fun. Everything just devolves into trolling. That's if the game works. If it does, try not to go over 60mph considering the massive lags spikes which hilarisouly throw everyone on server into walls every five to ten minutes.  Like I said though, game can be fun.  Be warned: there are many, many people playing together as cops and robbers 'boosting'.
6272	0	a	If Detroit were a game, this would it.
1276	1	a	Very fun game but my only problem is all the micro transactions and lack of players on some servers.
10002	1	a	This is as badass as it gets. Think of it as Fallout: New Vegas: The MMO, except that you get horses, ATVS, motorcycles, choppers, dune buggies, cars and even a mutant wolf to ride, every gun being craftable and rewarded via PvP and quests, major focus in world pvp aswell as competitive PvP arenas, and oh so much more. I have never seen such a fun to work with, and easy to use crafting system in any other MMO. It is easy to grab the materials you need, level it up, and build the next gun, sword, motorcycle, or armor with. This game will keep you entertained FOREVER. There are no seperate servers, but rather just one big one, so you will always have players at your side and truly have that 'MMO' feel all while not fighting over drops that NPCs give and the such. This is also one of few games that traveling far distances is actually enjoyable in. This game is absolutely HUGE and literally takes hours and hours to cross an entire region. I wish I could write more, but this is just gold.
9067	1	a	This game is by far one of the more enjoyable post apocalyptic mmorpg's combat is fun and interesting, the stat system is simple yet complex as you can choose what you want to be able to do in the game making it a unique experience for each indivual player. All in all a fun game to play either alone but more fun if you can get a group together making encounter's much easier.
2032	1	a	First of all, for those who decide to play without a Premium subscription, the game is unforgiving and quite frankly, very frustrating. Every part of the game screams Pay-To-Win with unfair matchups, overpowered weapons, overpowered abilities, overpowered verhicles, high prices for items and so on. Many fights often end up being a question of 'who payed for what' and not 'who has the better skill', which is a real shame, because the the game itself is actually really fun. Everything is extremely customizable. From characters to cars to clothing. You'll never see the same character design twice. Also with activities such as robbing stores, jacking cars, muggin people etc., you can experience the life of the little Gangster you always wanted to be.  In short, for people who like GTA San Andreas-type of games, APB is a blast. Best played with friends and with a Premium subscription. If you don't want to pay or don't have the patience, quickly forget about this game, because it will make you go mad. Trust me.
1788	1	a	GTA mixed into a mmo, its a fun game to play with alot of other people, there is some down sides, they could use more maps after a while it gets little boring with only 2 maps... but the upside is if you feel like running over people shooting everyting and even blowing up cars, chasing cops or cops chasing chrims this is a great mmo ITs FTP so no money will really need to be spent unless you want to!
3275	1	a	yoin mah clan... shadows of the nassebjÃ¶rns... its for only swedish people 
6548	0	a	LOL! Surprised this game is around still.. Its like the only people who play it are either fanboys or tryhards.
10181	0	a	Didn't care for the early game mechanics.  I feel other games can offer better packages of this theme.
5255	0	a	I want my 2 hours back ! car driving 0/10 guns 3/10 graphics 4/10 pay2win cheaters everywhere please don't download this game...I repeat do not download this game ! do you copy ?
8816	0	a	Honestly, this game has gotten pretty good on PC, they are really working to improve the community by banning hackers, and releasing frequent updates on how the game development is going.  However I'm not going to talk about the PC version, I'm going to talk about the Xbone version which seems to be doing terrible as of this moment. I mostly want to talk about false bans but there are other issues I will address here as well.  First the game was super laggy and broken when released, which is to be expected. However it still frequently crashes and lags up pretty hard despite the 'fixes' they have released.  The community is â¥â¥â¥â¥, but that comes with territory.  So I personally don't play the xbone version, I'm pretty loaded on PC and I'd rather not start over. My girlfriend however, plays the game almost religously. The clan she is in is pretty huge in the community, and is well known for elite players who have way too much time on their hands. Recently however a rival clan started PAYING people (he admitted to it, the owner has a recording of it) to mass report members of the clan my girlfriend is in. Pretty much half the clan has gotten false bans at this point, and G1's only response is 'we don't issue false bans' even after posting said proof of false mass reports, they just ignored it. The man in question paying his clannies to false report, is sitting back, laughing, and bragging in social about how he's gotten an entire clan banned, and G1 STILL refuses to do anything about it.  This is beyond pathetic, some of these players have already put quite a bit of money into the game. So why would it bennefit them to mod their xbone, and hack in APB? Also why haven't they been console locked for modding console and 'detected' hacks yet?   Exactly, because there was no wrong-doings on the part of said clan, except they were rivals with another huge clan that just wanted them out of the picture, and G1 doesn't give a single â¥â¥â¥â¥ about what goes on in the community, only what they feel is right and wrong will be addressed.  SOOOOO, until they decide to start giving a â¥â¥â¥â¥ about the xbone, which a lot of players have now moved to, or started playing. I'm not putting another â¥â¥â¥â¥ing penny into this game.
2919	1	a	The worst game EVER in the history, worst gamplay, worst community, worst everything. DonÂ´t download it.

8598	0	a	The best game ever, this game not only takes up room in your hard drive, it doesn't even start! Get your free trial today.
924	1	a	Love this game, Just starting the game up, with the very broken launcher, to get in a server full of hackers/cheaters it not the best thing to come into when you have spend like half hour fixing the launcher :s
9661	0	a	Too many buttons
768	1	a	in general this game is loads of fun, i love all the originality this games has from the customization to the the arsinal of guns you can use. the only complaint i have is the server lag, wich at times can be unplayable.
1845	1	a	They've apparently quit with the Pay 2 Win â¥â¥â¥â¥ so it's become a fun game again
3820	0	a	This game is full of the most saltiest individualds I've ever met, it takes Call of Duties community and makes it look like a saint.    as of 3/8/16 nothings changed except the game seems to be more dead AKA still sucks â¥â¥â¥
3276	1	a	It's a very good game. But it's (very) hard for newcomers. Some people say it's pay 2 win - nope it's definitely not P2W. People say that when they are losing and going mad about it (They're using excuses like 'This game is P2W' or 'You're Hacker' or they say that the weapons are unbalanced.) This game is fun, you must enjoy it and have fun while playing (with your friends or even alone) If you'll decide to play APB i recommend doing all tutorial tasks, trying every weapon you can and bringing some friends with you :D (use team speak 3)  Remember - Stay cool, never give up and don't go mad
2702	1	a	Like Grand Theft Auto, but like Team Fortress at the same time!
10325	0	a	i'd rather have a rabid bear tear my â¥â¥â¥â¥ off than play this game again
6943	0	a	For me, I was really excited about this game when I first saw it. It looked like a fun cops and robbers kind of game. When I got in, I realized that there was a good amount of customization available, which is always nice. I even set up some playlists to blast in my car. However, that's about as good as it will get. The gameplay is somewhat odd because everything feels kind of bland. There isn't too much to do in the world unless you are playing with friends. There are some missions that just feel really weird too. I didn't enjoy the controls much either. The community is alright, I guess. It's just not much that is offered in this game, but I guess that's kind of a regular thing for free-to-play games.

9389	1	a	It's okay for a game that came out way back in 2009 before being on steam; it's one of those long and slow progressing games ~ While you can level your toon pretty fast early on ~ you'll reach the slow grind and long crafting around lvl20. That's where I first gave up looking at the recipes taking 1-2days in real life with subscription boosts to craft.  It's more so a game you play when you had enough of Fallout 3 and moved on to Fallout New Vegas ~ then had enough of Fallout New Vegas for the moment [mods and the DLC will keep you busy for hours] ~ then you move on to Fallen Earth giving that a couple of hours ~Then back to Fallout New Vegas or Fallout 4 [steam sale going at the time of this post]  Note: No new content ~ Generally quiet ~ but the servers are still up so you can always pop in and check if you finally crafted your component ~ then craft the next 2 day wait component I have clocked about 110+ hours over the last 2 weeks ~ maybe 3 of them was actual game play the rest was waiting in craft [Not kidding] or travelling to a new lifenet pod city to get more recipes~ I've increased my Cooking level both in game and in real life during this time
8153	0	a	I would not recommend this game. If you're not willing to cough up the money, then the game isn't that fun. As either a Criminal or an Enforcer, you get mauled by others before you even get a chance to try to learn how to play. If you're new, then no one wants you. For me, probably because of my location from the server, it lags. This has a big impact. If it lags even a tiny bit, and makes it so you can't aim straight, or drive the car correctly, let's just say, 'It's not fun.' So, unless you don't have any lag at all, you can pick up how to play in the first few minutes, and you're willing to cough up the cash or barely get anywhere, then all the luck to you.
1284	1	a	This game is fun instead of getting GTA 5 just get this game and buy a membership this game is way better than GTA 5 this actually is optimized for PC and they care about there players!
1568	1	a	the best free-to-play on steam in my opinion
1097	1	a	Amazingly Addicting! A bit repetative though.
6231	0	a	glitching
6011	0	a	Another p2w, pile of trash, only this time, its the revival of the fastest mmo to ever be shut down. Thats always a beacon of confidence.
256	1	a	ok here is what you need to know  When you are free to play player You Need...  Shooting skills TryHard on every misson (with pure weapons) FarmHard to buy 3 solted weapon  When you Pay for weapons You Need....  No shooting skills needed just close your eyes and hold the fire botton bam you rekt evry one  ________________________________________________________________________________   unbalanced weapons   normal sniper : slow your running speed / hard to aim / can't use it while on car Payed sniper : won't slow your running speed / you can 360 no scope with it / you can use it while on car  normal assault rifle : sooo hard to aim / rip on close ranges Payed assault rifle : soooooo easy to aim with / and guss what? it's smg as well  ________________________________________________________________________________  That things makes you quit the game so unfair  BUT : the idea of the game is so cool it's like free Gta V
310	1	a	It's really fun when you get a bunch of friends to play with you. But if you don't, it's only meh.

7038	0	a	Hello Guys, I've played this game for years starting in 2010 with some friends and I have played around 2000+ hrs on my account and 60 something hours via steam, But the reason I'm writing this review is to give advice to the next Innocent person walking into this â¥â¥â¥â¥ hole of game. Firstly the game is a love hate relationship you either like it or hate it not to mention also customization is brilliant but here comes the negative aspects.  Apb is a free to play mmo cops and robbers themed game, With free to plays you expect microtransactions well there is but the problem is they milk people for money, without considering what people actually want. For example people want the engine update or fix's for annoying bugs, but instead of good updates which make people more happy they slap a armas gun on the market place claiming it to be something magnificent, but it is only a reskin of another weapon in game.   Another reason why this game is bad is because of it's own community, the people in the community are absolutely cancerous and only strive to â¥â¥â¥â¥ you off or make your day worse, Not saying everyone is cancerous because I've have spoke to quite a few nice people it's just the majority. Not to mention there are quite a few unbalanced weapons, like before I used to think 'Well that guy is Just better than me' Which in most cases it was; but if you put a unbalanced weapon in the hands of a good player or even a bad one they can â¥â¥â¥â¥ your entire match up.   After all of that Negative â¥â¥â¥â¥, I'll come down to saying this I'm giving a Warning to all players or people thinking of Playing this game. This game can cause you stress like nothing else and if you have anything like epilepsy or some sort PTSD stay away because it will cause you so much stress and make you soo â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ that you're either going to have a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing seizure or just freak the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out. Last thing I will say just to give you another reason to not play is gamersfirst make tons of promises which never happen.  Out of 1-10 It's a 4/10  Thus that makes the end of my Extremely Negative review and if any of you are interested I'm selling 4 of legendarys on Jericho (NA) add Ryoukomatoii and PM me or leave a message in this â¥â¥â¥â¥ review. Legendaries, Grenade launcher which shoots Concs, Nano, Ntec 7 Ursus and Hitchhiker I believe. I'll take real money these Will be going at a cheap price
4784	0	a	The game was built on a great idea, throw a few dozen players into a few square kilometer districts where they either become vigilante cops or hardened criminals. They than get into small groups with random players and go play various missions against the opposing faction. You start small; you're poorly dressed, drive a weak two door car, and have an assault rifle and pistol. But you team up with your friends, than suddenly a couple hundred hours into the game you're roaring down the street in a pimped out muslce car, hitting the Nos, with your teammate standing on top, shooting opponents with a rocket launcher.  Sounds fun right? Well too bad, because  Gamersfirst  Moneyfirst repurposed this game into a fully-automatic â¥â¥â¥â¥-You-Up-the-â¥â¥â¥-and-Steal-Your-Wallet Machine. The in-game guns you can buy are pretty damn good. But despite what the stats say, the ARMAS Marketplace guns (the guns you pay for with actual money) are most certainly better. The matchmaking system was coded by a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ monkey. You're a silver threat Rank 85? Awesome! Here's your teammate, he's a Green threat (lowest threat in game, you don't even START at green), your opponents are 3 Rank 255 Gold Threats with ARMAS weapons. Good â¥â¥â¥â¥ing luck! I wish I was exaggerating that last bit. The game has a pretty limited selection of vehicles, and even the fastest car, even with all the right mods and Nos, can only reach about 55mph, due to engine limitations, or â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ netcode, idk, either way,  Gamersfirst  Moneyfirst doesn't care enough to fix it.  But I will give it this, what it lacks in actual fun and gameplay, it nearly makes up for in customization. This game has, by far, the best character customization of any game, ever. I'm not over exaggerating that part either. The customization is absolutely superb. Vehicle customization is also pretty damn good, as long as you pay premium so you can put more than 7 decals on your â¥â¥â¥â¥ing car, trust me, it's hard to design an actual squad car with less than 7 decals.   In the end, unless G1 sells the game, it's â¥â¥â¥â¥ing done. I don't see redemption for it anytime soon, and most other players see it the same way. Don't bother with it, it's near worthless without going p2w.  Besides that, my friend in a dump truck launched my ambulance 200 meters in the sky, 11/10 APB: Space Program

P.S I Know This Is Not A Damn Bug I Spent All Night Downloading This Game So I Can Play It The Next Day!
3740	1	a	A poor mans GTA V so why not get it right it's free doesnt have much game content but it is still fun to play but it does have some pay to win aspects
7159	0	a	So APB has had a rocky road. Real Time Worlds was the first company to develop and make APB. However, the game was plagued with issues. From talk of supposed ex employes, the game was rushed out for lack of funds. Some employees cam out and posted concept art and plans for what they wanted to do with the game but couldn't because lack of funds. It sounds amazing.  So you had this game come out and it was horrible. The optimization was in a horrid state. Griefing and hackers everywhere. Horrible progression system. Some horrible missions. General horrible map design. To top it off...it cost 15$ a month to play.  Needless to say, it failed. It went under. RTW went out of business (hence the in memorium at the start of the game). The game I think lasted like 2 months? G1st bought them up later in 2010.   Sadly...they've done nothing with it. Lets go over the major changes they've made to the game.  1. New Anti-hack system - this helped with the hackers, but there will always be hackers in the game. Its in a much better state, but as a f2p game...you know how it goes.   2. Fightclub - Essentially they took parts of the pre existing map, put up barriers around it, put it into its own instance, then threw 12v12 battles into it over certain objectives. Not really adding anything. Mainly just...re-arranging stuff.   3. Joker Tickets - a special currency from fight club. I will say that they did add in quite a few items to be used with joker tickets.  4. Cash Shop Introduction  5. Numerous cash shop guns  6. Numerous cash shop clothing  7. Numerous cash shop cars/kits  8. Festival events that often have a heavy cash shop undertone   9. New 'end game' NPC that sells new clothing/gear  10. New equipment/consumables  11. Performance fixes/bug fixes/optimization  12. Removal of 'bad' missions and poor designed missions  13. A 'better' matchmaking system  So over the past 6 years, those are the major things that have been accomplished. As you can see, they didn't really add anything into the game. The major things that can be considered additions are the cash shop related stuff, one NPC that is at the very end, better anti hacker, and their gear, and joker tickets gear. Fightclub wasn't really an addition since they're basically just copy and pasting pre-existing code and blocking off a section of a map that is already there. The asylum is a special fight club only map, but even that is rumored to not be made by g1st. Apparently it already existed in the game files but wasn't quite ready for released. I think it took them like 3-4 years to released it.   Now there are problems that existed in the game with RTW...that still exist.   1. Matchmaking. It's horrible. See there are two things in the game. You have a threat level and a rank level. Now I think the max rank is 255. Rank is required to use some gear and generally tells you how long a player has been playing. Imagine this being like levels in a standard MMORPG. Higher ranks have access to more gear, equipment, upgrades, cars, etc. Threat level tells you how 'good' you are. You go from trainie, green, bronze, silver, gold. It's insanely easy to get gold if you're even moderately good. So how does the MM work? It only takes into account threat level. So I've been in situations where you have a rank 50-110 with low level gear going up against a highly geared 255 rank in gold districts. Heck, even silver districts have this issue. It doesn't end there.  Now this game has districts. Districts are split by threat level. Gold can join gold and silver districts. Silver can join (I think) gold, silver, and bronze. Bronze can join silver, bronze, and green. A gold can't join a bronze district for example. What people do is intentionally lose games to lower their threat level to join lower districts. I just had a fight where you me and one other silver and a traine going up against two rank 150+ gold players in a bronze district.    http://forums.gamersfirst.com/topic/391733-matchmaking-at-its-best/   That's a good indicator at how bad the MM is at its current state. Even with their attempts to fix it.   2. Horrible Map Design. They never really tried to fix some of the map issues. In terms of a shooter, it's still bad. Full of choke points, campable areas, and just general frustration. There are freeways in the game and they're what they sound like...big open freeways. People love to get snipers and sit on them because they're insanely hard to take out since you have to find a ramp and hope you can make it to the sniper before he shoots you as you drive across a big open area.   3. Edge of p2w. Right now the game is basically 'pay money for good gear now'. Most of the guns/weapons you can get in game. Personally I consider 'pay real money now or spend 30+ hours working towards the same gun' to be p2w.   4. Progression is slow. You need to progress roles and contacts to get certain gear. Some gear like upgrades require you to use a weapon to unlock upgrades for it. So if you want to get a certain upgrade for your assault rifle, you've got to use your assault rifle a ton. So if you're in a gold district there's a chance you'll be fighting highly customized weapons with a unmodded weapon. It's very frustrating.  5. Horrible Mission Design. So the only thing they touched with the mission system is taking out missions. Sadly, they can't take them out (that would mean they have to make more). There are still horrible ones. Two off the top of my head. One is called VIP. A player on one team is selected to be VIP and everyone in the game can see the big VIP marker from anywhere on the map. Through walls, etc. Basically taking out any sort of stealth strategy for one team. The VIP has a set amount of lives and the attacking team has a set amount of lives. Putting the entire games success on the hands of one individual that may or may not be horrible (and is handicapped with a 'wallhack' so to speak) is very frustating. I hate being the VIP. It's not fun. Another one is where each team gets a big marker above the head of each member and a set amount of lives for the team. Basically a TDM. Again, no stealth. The amount of times I've seen people standing behind walls looking at one another with third person view waiting for the other to move is a ton. Or they all go to some insanely easy campable area only counterable with a nade launcher (which is like an endgame, last unlocked weapon). Or worse, they get enough kills to be considered 'winning' and then they run around the map running the clock.   6. Optimzation issues. Still huge FPS drops randomly. I think it has something to do with the gun smoke. I can run Gw2, GTA V, planetside 2, elite dangerous, etc etc. However, I still get horrible FPS drops in this game. Apparently they're making a new renderer which I hope will help the game. It's very frustrating to get into a firefight and have your FPS Drop to like 2-5 randomly in the middle of it.   7. Spawning. Spawning in both Fightclub and the vanilla mode is horrible. For example on the VIP thing. The amount of times I've been spawned in road right in the sights of an enemy sniper is a lot. Or wayyy far away from any team members and closer to enemies. Today I was playing fightclub capturing a point and TWO enemies spawned next to the point and killed me. So lame.   The major reason that this game is pulling the numbers it does (peaks at around 2300 right now) is because there's no other game like it. GTA V did put a dent in the population. APB averaged around 2100 players the same month as GTA V release and some months before that. After it released it has been dropping till what it is now...averaging 1400 player. If they actually did something with this game in the 6 years they've owned it, I'd recommend it. Right now it seems like they're putting forth minimal effot to keep it alive and makin money. Maybe they've spent all this time prepping it for console release

4690	0	a	This game only accomplishes one thing, customization. Everything else this game attempts to do is utter failure. Missions/Matches are greatly one sided, the gun play (The MAIN Point of a PVP Shooter) is copy and pace, repetitive, buggy, just flat out boring, driving is exactly what you would expect out of a F2P, âPoint A to point Bâ¦ Yayâ¦â and the game has a community worse than Halo and CoD!  All the time I spent in this game equaled to this.  70% Raging at a bad match because of how bad of a game this is. 25% Sitting in the social area AFK. 1% Having fun in a match. 3% Fun goofing around in the bland, small open areas (Its not even worth calling a sand box). 1% Enjoying the limited customization options for a non-monthly payment account.  This game is a perfect example of a horrible Pay2Win game being considered good by morons. Even being a Pay2Win, youâll still have to level up so slowly to the point where it makes Bad Company 2 level grinding look quick.  This game is even a better example than Call of Duty in showing how humans enjoy repetitive, copy and past, garbage.  The rating I give this game is a 2/10, not even worth looking at on the Steam Store. Its definitely not worth Recommending to anyone, unless you want them to check if Steamâs Uninstall button is still working.
8896	1	a	Really fun for a while. Environments are beautiful and the people are generally nice.  The Role-playing Community is one of the best I've encountered however, most have left (with myself) due to the fact it gets very repetitive and boring after a few hundred hours.  Good time killer.
3309	1	a	I love this game a lot.A real police game. I would like to have good Grapical. I really exicited to play this game. I canÂ´t wait anymore.I love police games.And in this game you can play youÂ´re real life that is fantastic. Fantastic
6914	0	a	Absolutly the worst match making system I've ever seen on ANYTHING, me and my friends just constantly going back and forth between gold and silver while really low level facing level 100+ enemies with pay to win guns on gold and losing and facing what feel like noobs in silver then going back to gold again, gameplay wise it's not too bad but it's unplayable when you're matched up against completely uneven odds... I'd say 5/10 if they improve the match making (which I seriously doubt since it hasn't changed for the past 5 years) I refuse to rate it any higher
312	1	a	If you play this all day.....you need a live man!    PS:add me and i will play with you! XD  I need a live too. :/
4903	0	a	Boring
1076	1	a	BLUF: Kinda like GTA, if you like that you might like APB, and this is free!  Dislikes: Controls (Having a hard time using a controller, and some keybinds weren't working) Repetition (Every game has it, but it tends to feel quite the same after a day or so) No others at this time, sorry to disappoint!  Likes: Customization (You can customize your character, car and weapons. Many different looks!) Server Ranks (You get ranked based off your ability to play, but it's a little broke as you can drop rank easy) Free to Play (The F2P model isn't bad, and the premium value is worth it for an avid player)
7541	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ bugged game dont waste ur time on this game totally useless, too much time and internet data wasting zz
1897	1	a	Best game i've seen that lets you choose whether to be a criminal or a enforcer. Its not pay to win, i myself use the starter gun and i get my share of kills. 8/10
2938	1	a	Cops and Robbers, GTA style. What's not to love?   In-game midi sampler to create your own 'theme' In-game MP3 import system for car radio F2P Customisations only limited by number, not customisation.   Only thing is 250ms+ latency makes some missions unplayable, especially against those near the US Datacentres.
4758	0	a	Character creation was fun.  That was all the fun this game had to offer.  Edit: Honestly, yeah, I'm an APB scrub-- and for a reason. This game is purely all show and no go just as much as it is a pay-to-win scheme of a game. (And based on your hours, I guess you fell for that.)   The developers would much rather keep their blockheaded playerbase happy with updates that exclusively include more guns rather than EVER updating the game's engine or fixing/ adding onto APB's bland as balls gameplay. I mean, don't get me wrong, I guess I can see that driving around and doing the same â¥â¥â¥â¥ over and over again could be amusing to some people. But I feel like that's just a very small demographic of likeminded people who require little to no mental stimulation.   This game literally offers nothing new or innovative and the hours you'll spend on it before realizing that there's nothing more to it, are spent making up characters or customizing other things.   I don't know. Say what you will, but every other review for this game just rolls over the same points I just made.   TL:DR I'm a scrub but this game still sucks donkey â¥â¥â¥.  Abridged Version for the APB: Reloaded Playerbase:  'yo, y u spendin' yo money on dis gaem when dere nothing 2 do lmao dis girl buggy as hell an she aint got no game, playa.' 
10271	1	a	ver y ver y very good game i'd class it as A 'Sandbox' mmo witch are ma favroute type of games 'sandox' ones exept in strategy games lol
3428	1	a	I cannot believe this game is still around...so many bugs and cheaters.
9114	1	a	Pretty nice game without bugs but got serious in upgrading quality and communication with people there. Final score 6.5
8351	0	a	Major hackfest + pay to win in every way possible, it used to be a great game but the devs got greedy... avoid at all costs if you wish to keep your sanity in check.
10522	1	a	This weird pixel graphic action mmo dungeon crawler with rogue-like elements was created a long time ago by a small company called wildshadow. After years of awesomeness they had to sell it to kabam to keep the game going, kabam kept it going for some more years also, and now finally it's in the hands of Deca(Thankfully being revived by them after kabam's dark era). I've been with this game for so long i keep coming back to it, the 1000+ hours i have here are only with the steam account(had 2 older accounts before this one). I'm mentioning this so you get the idea that this game is very hard to kill, the people just wanna play this ****. If you're thinking about playing this game let me transfer some of my genuine info to you :). The game is extremely grind-based, so if you're not someone who likes to grind for endless hours everyday then this game should be a pass for you before i even go any further. Now for some pros and cons.  + Huge variety of enemies/bosses/events with unique variations of butt-clenching bullet hell patterns and tactics. + More than big enough player base( very active game) + Huge variety of items that adds to the already great replayabilty value of the game. + The game is based alot on team play and as mentioned above there's always people to play along with. + The game is being properly revived by Deca games and right now is the best time to start playing this game. (Month of the mad god, a special month, will run from 21 july till around the end of august).  - The community(Like most gaming communities) can be very toxic at times. Not as toxic as moba communities don't worry :) - Lag in this game can punish you extremely high as it is a perma-death game. You need to take caution from both server lag and your own internet lag as not to lose a month work in a second. If you have a decently stable internet connection you should be safe from a lag related death most of the time though. - Client users/Hacker/Dupers/Bots love to manifest this game; BUT Deca(unlike kabam) is already showing alot of promise in making this a thing of history(fingers crossed).  Conclusion: Definitely a strong recommendation from me, i absoloutely love this game, and you won't have to pay a dime to try it so you should definitely do that. 9/10
7201	0	a	its a peace of â¥â¥â¥â¥ dont play it
6984	0	a	Pretty difficult to get a formidiable gun without paying money.
976	1	a	GTA Online, basically.  Get this game. Mostly due to the fact that it's free to play, but also because its a solid game. It has a lot in common with the extremely popular GTA franchise, with its massive open-world, car stealing, citizen killing and varied weapon selection, but it obviously lacks a coherent story, since it's mostly a Massively Multiplayer Online game, so if you're looking for story, don't try this game. If you're looking for quick fun, action packed gameplay, try it out.   The customization is INSANE in this, you'll probably spend a few hours just to create your character. And the customization doesnt stop here: weapons, clothing (you can customize the clothings, not just what your character is weraing, meaning you can not only change colors but apply designs, logos, emblems, etc on them) and the many vehicles are 100% customizable (and usually upgradable aswell)  Thanks to its random missions and its nice PVP mode, the replayability is extremely high in this game. Just jump in and play.  Graphics 10/10 Soundtrack 9/10 Replayability 14/15 Gameplay 12/15  Overall - 9/10
5962	0	a	APB... a P2W game where losers who don't have any skill in games gather to buy weapons that give them advantage so that they can feel a little bit better about themself when they destroy someone with a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ pistol/smg in few hits... that about sums it all up i guess, nothing else needs to be said about this game besides it not being worth your time, don't worther downloading it because you will be disappointed very quickly and you will regret ever being born into a world where this game exists, id rather watch my windows update itself rather than play this game.
4780	0	a	Played it a few years ago outside steam. This is a sad, disappointing joke of a game. Great idea, but completely unbalanced, terribly running, full of P2W. New players have nothing to say here, they are going to get torn to shreds by grenades and high level, out of balance P2W guns literally during their first mission. Cars behave awful, game looks mediocre, gun handling seems â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Complete waste of time, unless you want to have a go with custimising aspect of the game, which is amazing. But the grind to get money WILL be very repetitive/painful.
8273	0	a	+Customization -Everything else
5524	0	a	This game is fun, I'll give them that. It's like an F2P GTA with no real way to go. I played this game a lot, even though I only have 5.9 hours, reason being, I left the game for awhile. I didn't play for a real long time and I just played other games, which is okay, but when I tried to come back, BOOM, no server ever responded. I tried everything I could to try to play this game again, but the servers wouldn't budge. I made a new character, I made a new account, I tried to talk to the devs, they wouldn't respond, nothing would happen. So I eventually had to give up this fun game. So if you plan on getting this game, if it works, don't plan on playing for more than, hmm, about a year? I dunno, I just wish they could fix this game.
6945	0	a	This game flat out dosent work.
8101	0	a	After 250 hours of grinding and acheiving gold rank the without shelling out $250 for a weapon, I was blown away (literaly) with the sheer pay to win game this has become. The players with the magic ability of excess money have access to the most overpowered and broken guns, abilities, vehicles, and gear imaginable. Trying to play this game as a free to play player is a death sentance. You will be massacred by premium weapons and peak level players who have unlocked every weapon and are free to unleash it on lower level characters who just finished the tutorial. It's very ironic, playing a cops and robbers game that espouses the concepts of justice and freedom, only to have financle shackles placed firmly on the wallets of the players.

3830	0	a	This review is based on my many years playing this game, from the very beginning of RTW Closed beta til now. And the info that has been collected from time spent on forums/APB Blog.  There was a time when this was my favorite game, and pretty much all i played most of the time. But as time have passed, i'm realizing that the company that bought this game from RTW either gives no â¥â¥â¥â¥s, or are just too incompetent to improve it.  There hasn't been a proper content update for years, all they do is release reskins of already exisitng guns. And if we're lucky, we get an unreleased gun that RTW didn't finish back in 2010. The excuse for the last few years has been the engine upgrade, which might just be in development by 2 people at this point, since they've fired everyone who created the game.  Then there is the forums, one of the few places you could attempt to get some answers from G1. That is if you don't get your thread deleted within minutes, because it asks questions that G1 does not wish to answer. Their solutions to controversy seems to be to just delete any evidence of it, and pretend that everything is perfect in little ol' APB town. But the worst part is that the game is no longer competetive on the global market. Several games blows this game out of the water the second we start talking about gameplay, and really all that this game has got going for it anymore is the customization. You can truly make anything you want, except not anything you want, since G1 has stated several times that they will ban creators of offensive/sexual content, even though it's an 18+ game, and also 2016 guys, seriously.  Pros: + Gameplay (by Original Developers Real Time Worlds) + Customization (very extensive, truly one of the best ever) + Something for both the casual and competetive gamers. (Very random and fun game, but also very skill based) + Might aswell say the game that RTW made, cause this game is fundamentally really good.  Cons:   - Optimization is â¥â¥â¥â¥. - Utterly dead development wise - Terrible forum management - Gun releases (OP at first to promote sales, then nerfed when bought by players) - Constant Armas Releases (pointless reskins), and nothing else. - The incompetence of the current owners. (G1)
4174	0	a	The game can be quite fun and more or less fair (even without paying any money), but I ran into the following problem:  After installing and starting it up I suddenly got a Punkbuster permanent ban after about 15 minutes of playing. I didn't cheat, I don't even have cheat related software on my computer (I know, you don't believe me and that's okay, but I'm speaking the truth here). The support won't do a thing about it (just sending pregenerated messages) and Punkbuster only tells you that someone else may have hacked my account and cheated.. which I don't believe.  I then made another account on my Laptop and have played for hours there without getting a ban. Now I'm afraid to spend any kind of money on this game if I'll just get banned again without even getting a proper reason.  So watch out if you do intend to spend time and money in this game, I still don't know why Punkbuster issued a ban on me. It could either have been Nvidia Shadowplay (with the FPS overlay) or Borderless Gaming (which I didn't use for this game) or AutoHotKey (Which I use for my keyboard layout and have never had a problem in any other game yet). I heard there are ways to cheat with AutoHotKey, but I never touched any of those scripts.  So believe me or not, but I was a legitimate player and received a permanent ban after 15 minutes of playing. Support won't help a bit and Punkbuster won't tell me why they banned me, so I'll probably never find out what happened.
3641	1	a	I'm generally very picky about games, but this I've enjoyed for 4+ years and still to this day enjoying it! Matter of fact, I bought a gaming computer just to run this game the way I wanted to! No regrets at all! Great and amazing game!
7049	0	a	It's hard to call that playing as it kept shutting down. Buggy.
944	1	a	i recommend this game. its like a free gta..
9190	0	a	Its bad, confusing in start, playbase is â¥â¥â¥â¥
7055	0	a	Gets boring after a while... You have to work for a quite a long time to achive what you wanna have. The only thing I like is that you can really put a lot into making your characters. Kinda like The Sims 4 at that point, but poorer.
2821	1	a	This is a fun multiplayer third person shooter, it has a lot of customizaiton and is very addictive. If you enjoy GTA or games similar to that this is a must have, and best of all its free.
3774	0	a	To help you put things in perspective, I came from a VERY long hiatus. In fact, back then I played it outside of Steam before I did the 'change' over to Steam's installation. But now, in what I call a flurry of foolishness, I decided today to give the game another whack.  This is the point where you insert an audible 'sigh'.  APB: Reloaded, in it's early days, started off well enough. In fact, I'll go as far as to say I bought a shotgun from their Armas store (not even a great one...) which should be indicative of the hopes I had for it.  APB, simply put, pits you as either a Cop or a Crook. Crooks make money by commiting crimes such as crash-robbing store fronts, robbing pedestrians, doing missions... Well, their main source of income is mainly robbing storefronts. Crash a car in and get away with what pops out. Cops, well... All they can do is do missions or try and spot anyone committing a crime and then busting their chops for it. Any loot is returned to the evidence locker, which basically is as imbalanced as it sounds in terms of methods of profit.  In it's base concept, this sounds like a great idea for a game. The execution is fairly okay too, but there are some snags and other things that collectively ruin the game as a whole.  - I'm just going to kick in the door with the biggest sin: GamersFirst has a serious pest problem, in the shape of so-called 'Hackers'. Calling it Aimbotting is probably specific enough and self-explanatory. It was a pest when I left, and it was a pest within the first ten minutes of actual combat when I came back.  There's always going to be that controversial argument of 'maybe they're just really that good'. This might be a viable stance to take. But mind you, I've endured Aimbotting for an extended period in APB before I finally said goodbye to it. These Aimbotters may attempt to 'simulate' some more realistic response times. But let me tell you this: Back in those earlier days, I had someone admit he was using an Aimbot hack, which gave me a solid benchmark that allowed me to compare my previous experiences.  I have gotten a very solid impression of it, as well as an expertise to recognize Aimbotting and there was no doubt in my mind that in the brief period I played again, I was being subjected to it. GamersFirst has always claimed to come down hard on these things. But if they can't solve this problem within the two years that I left, then they seriously need to rethink of using a different anti-hack shield. Because it's the same one, and it really isn't working out for them. At this point, I even wonder if G1 cares anymore.  - The second controversial topic is the well-worn Pay-2-Win one. Funnily enough, if this game sins to this, it might be to a minor but still existing level. The Armas store has a range of special (and expensive) weapons for sale that for the most part have an improvement or exceptional trait over their regular counterpart. At first glance, these improvements seem minor. But when you get to know the 'standard' weapons, you'll understand that the improved version actually greatly counteracts the shortcomings the regular weapon has. For example, the SMG is a pretty great weapon that is only halted by it's short range. The equivalent that you can find in the Armas store has extended range. The changes are subtle and you won't really notice them until you are familiar with the weapon and have bothered to put 'two and two together'.  Not to mention that the Vehicles generally are very souped up in speed (even with a lot of weight in the car) and have either a series of useful mods installed or all mod slots unlocked. Either of which would require you to spend ginormous amounts of in-game currency AND level your character near maximum. If already possible with some vehicles.  - The 'normal' weaponry is a bit of a nuisance itself. More primarily in the way that you 'own' these. Now, APB isn't the first to 'rent' their guns and certainly won't be the last. But so far, this game is the only one that insists on only renting these for a set period of 10 days. No more, no less. You can't rent it for one day, or for one month. The only upside is that, in case of a rented weapon that has mods slotted in, you can simply 're-rent' it. Certainly isn't a redeeming factor, though.  - When it comes to missions, they will seem fine to the naked eye. Every 'mission' has a certain structure of stages to it. But the weakness in these lies in it's exploitations. There are two big examples of this.  Some missions end with a 'tug of war'. Everyone's position will show up in the HUD, and you need to constantly kill the opposing team's members to advance your 'pull'. Sadly, what has become common practise is that one team gets the advantage of even just 1 point, and then flees altogether. Going far enough so there is no way the opposing team can catch up and try and even the score. Allowing the aforementioned team to win by time-out. This is an extremely cheap way to gain victory and sadly has been practised by both Cops and Crooks. Especially since... well, if they'll do it, why shouldn't you?  The VIP ending is a touch worse. One member of one team becomes the 'VIP', which the opposing team has to assassinate. What common practice has become here is that there are set locations on the map where you can perfectly bunker down or 'camp' where the VIP can hide and all the defending team members have perfect defensive locations. Making it an impossible task for the opposing team to win.  These are exploits that have been around for quite some time. And while I skimmed the changelog of APB's update blog, I have no reason to believe this has changed. GamersFirst does not have a reputation of listening to it's playerbase.  - And as a final complaint... the fact that there's a serious lack of new content. The only difference I saw between now and two years ago is that every weapon now has a set of unlockable or purchaseable 'skins'. In fact, one of the other changes is a detriment. The 'Fight Club' serves are now locked to certain requirements, such as achieving rank in this and that. Funnily enough, I actually achieved these ranks long before I left APB, but apparently the game does not consider these as valid any more.   The bottom line is, APB is an IP that was bought over by GamersFirst to be turned into APB: Reloaded. It became Free To Play, but in return became a straight cash in through it's cash shop. Everything ties in with laying down more cash. Why just spend money in the Armas store if you can get a discount for being Premium? Why rent guns with in game currency if you can permanently have them for the price of three Indy Game titles!? (yes, the earlier mentioned shotgun actually set me back 12 Euros. The prices may have changed now, but that doesn't change much)  GamersFirst has one heck of a PR Team to make us believe that they are still actively developing this game and making significant updates. But realistically speaking, all this game updates anymore is the guarantee the Armas store works and you are still encouraged to buy some Premium time.  Please, I ask you: Don't play this game for a serious experience. And if you still play it, be it to have some stupid fun with friends (which is a perfectly viable reason), then don't purchase anything from the Cash Shop. The prices don't add up to what you'll receive, and it only helps fund this atrocity of a business plan behind this game.  If anything, it's slow death should only be hastened. Another great game, ruined by corporate greed and short-sightedness.
283	1	a	APB Reloaded is almost the free Grand Theft Auto Online but you can be a cop or crook so this game is very interesting to play so i would this game out of scale 10 9.5 out of 10
10280	0	a	i recommend this
1683	1	a	Not bad for a free game however as soon as you start the game you instantly feel the pressure of microtransactions.
2942	1	a	Great game but it was really laggy for me so I didnt have the best experience,but it was still good
10700	1	a	-sigh-  such anger and sadness.
5624	0	a	You can feel the pay2win at the start, when expecially when you are a new player and you have a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥ weapon and you must compete against other players that spent more time on this game, and have all RPG'S, Grenade launcher and OP weapons. Plus it's full of weeaboos and nerds, another reason for uninstall this game.
4892	0	a	This game is good until it radomly puts you on missions were you dont even have auto ready up on wich if they dont fix im telling my friends who play and dont play not to play until this problem is resolved.
355	1	a	This game is Like GTA and Saint's Row it's a lot of fun if you like SR or GTA then you will Love APB i Recomment downloading this game and trying it out after all it is Free
9526	1	a	IT WAS AWESOME ALMOST AS AWESOME AS THE 4 DAY DOWNLOAD!!!
10380	1	a	The game could've been better, reinstalling because it used to be good and I reset computer from viruses...
7301	0	a	I downloaded this game hoping for it to be what I hoped GTA V online to be like (before the game came out). I was for sure, not let down when you were allowed to steal cars and use guns in this game. However, it being stricly online make sit impossible to learn unless everyone around you is also new to the game. In a game like GTA V you can practice in story mode then take your skills to the streets of Los Santos online. This game did not allow me to do that, leaving me terribly confused and irritated to say the least. Unless you're good with shooters like this, I do not recommend this game.
7927	0	a	A horrible example of how overwhelming a pay-to-play game can get. This game is not kind at all for new players and is NOT meant for lower-end computers. The game's worlds are tiny and the missions get repetitive easily.
5375	0	a	This game is the â¥â¥â¥â¥!  actualy -'the'  this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥.
8691	0	a	Wellfare GTA 5 Online.  With somehow even more hackers.
6538	0	a	Couldn't even get it to load up :/ kept crashing and I have a amazing computer...... so I hope this works for someone and they can tell me if it's good
3804	0	a	My relationship with APB: Reloaded has been like how an abused spouse comes back to her partner. You come back hoping everything has changed and the game has gotten better over the past year or so, but all in all it's still just a bad game deep down inside. Bad analogy? Let me explain why.  APB: Reloaded is fun but extremely hard to get into due to the fact that when you start out you get paired with people WELL beyond your skill level, and not even the tutorial city can prepare you for the assraping you recieve once you get into a real server. Going into a Bronze server? Prepare to get rekt by recently upthreated Golds and on-the-border upthreating Silvers as you get called a noob and eventually booted for not knowing what to do. Sure, Golds are banned from Bronze threat servers, but the only thing they have to do is de-threat to silver and it'll be no time before they start pounding your innocent virgin pucker back to submission. The thing that really shines in the game, however, is customization. You can customize your character to your hearts content to make them look like the baddest flipping cop or the finest looking criminal, but unfortunately that's where the positives really end. Missions are tedious 'capture the flag', 'hold the point', and 'team deathmatch' modes, weapons that are way too overpowered to be in the game are easilly obtained throughout the first few hours of the game, and 'pay to win' elements are painfully obvious. Furthermore, the community and social aspects of the game are absolutely horrible. The only thing you'll see someone type most of the time in-game are either insults or hacking accusations, and most of the time your teammates will be doing solo kill runs while rarely focusing on objectives, inevitably resulting in loss, and consequentially, more rage. Compared to the last year, opposed from previous reviews by others, hacking has (almost) been abolished by Reloaded's new anti-cheat engine, named 'FairFight'. Whether hacks for the game still exist or not are unknown, but you'll rarely find a person using a script in the game nowadays, lest they get caught, publicly shamed, and banned by their automatic anti-cheat program.  I've installed APB two times, and tried my hardest to get back into it. It's a great game, don't get me wrong, but unless you've got some balls and a good trigger finger, or a team of friends backing you up, it's not worth the download. Overall, APB: Reloaded has not aged well since it's initial release.  Summary:  Gameplay - 4/10 Community - 1/10 Graphics/Visuals - 7/10 Replayability - 5/10 Immersion - 4/10  Overall: 4/10
6014	0	a	I played a little bit I guess.  Pay 2 Win.
9035	0	a	worst game ever , with the worst gamplay first. 1. low and shity graphics  2.bullcrap story 3.pay 2 win 4.dont waste your time on this peace on crap
551	1	a	Honestly id say its a great game, ive had alot of good hours in this.  Easy to get into a clan, meet some people and enjoy some hours in missions. But then again boring alone, full of trolls like everyother game, not just to get started on the toxic players in this game. Cheaters included. Some says its p2w but id say it pay to look good. Most of the guns in armas are reskins, every gun can be beaten so i wouldnt listen to that.  Then again it gets boring in the long run, mostly the same things over and over, so be creative and have some fun with friends and its an enjoyable game.
5245	0	a	My friend died from the amount of brain cells he lost playing this game.
1806	1	a	APB Reloaded is an alright game.. it feels kinda like GTA's â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ cousin. Its biggest problems is pay-2-win and matchmaking. 6/10
8367	0	a	This game has good customization, and okay gameplay. it however has one of the worst communitys in gaming history, somewhere between ark and LoL. i tried one mission recently and it was easily greifed by a high level player that kept killing us. why can you even kill your own teammates during a mission vital for leveling up? thats just asking for trolls.  on top of that if you want anythign beyond the starter that isn't clothes, be prepared to dish out real money. and they're not cheap. and they're not permenent. so you pay $20 for a gun that only last 90 days at max, and the time costs extra. the guns you get from ingame currency are only 7 days max, so pretty much worthless.  the fact that a high and max level player can join a level 1 mission is also what ruins the game. imagine trying to win a mission thats supposed to be easy agenst a player with a rocketlauncher that one hits you. thats this game in a nutshell.
6148	0	a	It's been 30 minutes and I haven't even made a character. This game sums up the worst of PC gaming; once downloaded through Steam, it opens another downloader. Once this downloader has downloaded the hacking detection software and updates, you can start the game (which uses way more ram than it should?). You can't play yet! You need to sign up to their website. Once signed in, pressing esc once on the menu takes you back to sign in again. Once signing in again, you get to the character creator which is extremely limited to non-payers.  The menu screens take twice as much power as Skyrim with an ENB. Menu screens, not even close to the high setting either.  After uninstalling the game, I had to uninstall the other stuff it runs in the background. I feel like I need to do a virus scan now.  Stick with Saints Row or GTA.  This is rubbish, not something I'd expect to see on Steam.
1307	1	a	I bet Its a good game just my computer cant handle it
9904	1	a	this game is just like fallout
8734	0	a	Addictive but also â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ttingly frustrating at times. Rounds usually aren't very fair.  Probably wouldn't waste my time on it again.
381	1	a	Awsome game even tho they say that. Like gta lol. WHAT IS THE POINT OF BUYING GTA IF THIS IS FREE?!?!?!??!  good luck with the game  hope i dont do i thumbs down!  Thanks allways when im bored helps me alot.

8	1	a	Difficulty: Difficult  The Bottom Line: Solid/Great Score: 8.0  Potentially great game ruined by the game community / chaos and hostile environment.  In a gaming world filled with sci-fi and war-themed multiplayer games, APB seems like a breath of fresh air. It takes place in modern times more or less, in a city torn apart by criminals activity. You have the choice of playing as a Criminal (gang member) or Enforcer (law enforcement) and basically have to carry out missions depending on what type of character you're playing. Often you will have to team with other players and take out 'enemies' as you carry out your mission.  When you first play around with APB: R, it's actually kind of fun. It's like a lite version of GTA mixed in with a little Saints Row. As the action unfolds, San Paro's NPC citizens react to the action as it enfolds, sometimes crouching, screaming, diving for cover, or cursing, making the city come alive.  Your experience As a newbie is pure chaos, frustration, and confusion. Go on the PvP missions and you will get blasted again and again and again relentlessly by extremely high level players or hackers/ cheaters. Slaughtered doesn't even begin to describe what happens. 'Teaming' isn't at all like co-op, where you and a bunch of people interact and help each other out. Usually, it's more like a bunch of random people thrown together with no sense of teamwork who just 'do their own thing' while carrying out a mission and ignoring you and other teammates. Ironically, while keeping silent throughout the entire mission, they'll suddenly grumble in chat about how much the team 'sucked' after the mission is lost, and then angrily leave it. Team leaders will similarly keep quiet during gameplay and not give any guidance throughout, then kick newbies off their missions when things go wrong. But as for now. gamersfirst has fixed this and you no longer get kicked unless you have a demerit medal.  Expect to be kicked/ abandoned during or after a mission a lot if you're a newbie. If you're not sensitive, you'll just become angered by the 'kicking' because by being constantly dumped, you never gain enough experience to get better at the game or meet new friends who you can play with in the future. But if you're a sensitive player, the endless round of being dumped makes the game feel hostile. The chaos is out of this world! You'll be on a mission minding your own business and suddenly a player who isn't part of your mission will just keep ramming the crap out of your vehicle over and over again or running you over. Sometimes even your own teammates will kill you by running you over with a car or shooting you for no reason.  This is exactly what the first few days for the newbie will be like-- slaughter, griefing, uncommunicative teammates, team leaders angrily kicking you off missions, teammates whining about how much their team 'sucked, being abandoned by teammates during missions. Regardless of all that. when it comes to me. having a lot of friends in the game and enjoying every moment having fun while we're playing and laughing and ignoring all the bad in game community. it's all worth it.  What else can you do in game rather than playing? Tons of thingies.  If you're a boy then you can be a 'Girl' if you're a girl then you can be a 'Boy' K-k-Kawaii-everybody wins.  You can stand 24 hours in a social district being busy or simply being afk all day.  You can be a business man or business woman and sell thingies.  You can be a designer and design thingies.  You can be creative and create thingies.  One of the best thing in this game is the Character customization. It's really great how possible you can get your in game character face to look like you in real life. which that is something people in game don't do much. usually similar/preset faces.  Overall: As for 2014. The game is still getting even more better and will get a new solid engine and will get more content and more people to play this great game. Weather you're a veteran or new, make sure to give this game a chance and jump and enjoy the chaos.
3535	1	a	You can still get money for them big ole heavy tvs' from the shop! I think the games time frame is first nokia phone thru right before flat screen tv.
6335	0	a	I hate this game. Random nonsense.
8095	0	a	It not good because if you like starting out you and when you in a fight the team is overpower if you want to get better it like $50 to buy to get what you want the other game Fallen earth is a lot better than this game and you buit and pvp as long as you want
88	1	a	Personally, I really like this game, and have devoted quite a while into it. The patches and all do move along at a somewhat slow rate, given the small dev team, but I think its actually a really good game. I read some of the other reviews and I will address some of the issues mentioned.  Pay2Win- Basically every gun in the ARMAS Marketplace is a reskin of a gun you get from in-game progression, and the few execeptions have lots of downsides to balance their upsides. Anyone who claims that guns are p2w most likely hasn't gone to the cash shop and trialed the guns, which by the way, you can do, trialing all of the guns for 30minutes/3hours depending if you have premium membership. Really though, the in-game progression weapons are on par, or even better than their cash shop counterparts.  Hackers-  This community is so paranoid of hackers, its pretty much a given that either one person might seem like they are hacking, or you will get hackusated. Just realize that its possible that people are better than you, because some people have been around 4-5 years, since the start in RTW times.  Lag- At the time of this post, one of the districts, Waterfront, has been rather laggy, but they have been working on a fix for it, and the lag only occurs when there are more than 60 people per instance (excess people can move to a different instance to fight the lag, but sometimes they just don't)  Okay, and one more thing, its not as if you are paying $60 + DLC galore, its a free game. I understand this game might not be for everyone, mainly people that can't accept that people are better than them, and resort to calling people hackers or calling weapons p2w. Give it a shot, though, because it truly is pretty good quality for a f2p game.

8042	0	a	I wouldn't pay attention to the trailers. Very misleading. I trusted them and expected something like Grand Theft Auto, so of course I was interested. What I got was a cash-grabby clone with sloppy controls and cringe-worthy player base.  The game takes every moment as an opportunity to squeeze a couple bucks out of you. Seriously, 100 dollars for an expansion pack? That's ridiculous.  The controls are pretty bad- They are very unresponsive and sloppy, definately not what the trailer advertised.  Bad game, just shell out the money for Grand Theft Auto V. It's much better and probably cheaper in the long run.

4616	0	a	Wow, ok. So apparently they made this free to play. So, long ago I had actually BOUGHT this game and up until about 2014 I had it in my steam library, because it was a purchase. Well, I go to play some today (2016) and find that it was removed from my account, either because they 're-released' it, or because they voided my purchase. Anyway, I go to download it and notice that it isn't 'free to play' but actually 'free to pay' NINETY-NINE F'ING DOLLARS FOR DLC?! THIRTY DOLLARS? The developers also don't know how to do DLC because they have the same DLC pack for both $29 and...free....So, let me see, you delete the game (which I paid for), didn't issue me a refund, and now expect people to pay $139 for your DLC which adds basic game functionality to it? Oh, yeah, they also have a habit of deleting your accounts due to 'database malfunctions'. (see 2011) HA! No way I would recomend this. This was a dead game back in 2011 and now, under the tyranical control of the new 'developers' (must be french for check cashers), has become not only a joke but a steaming pile of feces.
8650	0	a	GTA but online. Super fun. Download it!  Edit:  I used to love this game, but it has been ruined by G1. The game is entirely pay to win, there's a huge amount of hackers, no communication from G1 about what's going on with the game, and when I just recently tried to play the game again, I couldn't even connect to the server. This game would have done well in the hands of capable developers and publishers, but unfortunately that's not the case.
636	1	a	it's ok
10058	1	a	Free 2 Play and not a Pay 2 Win! The 'buy now' sticker can be moved off the screen by the way.  But yeah though, I had my fun with this game, it was actually pretty great up untill you start getting into Territory Control (TC) where the map is constantly ruled by the Travelers because nothing beats Dual Pistols simply because every disadvantage a pistol is supposed to have, simply doesn't exsist oh sure they argue 'Duh huh huh ammos expansive tho'  Not when you have 40+ Chip harvesters pumping out a constant line of red chips for you. Play the game but dont get into the PVP unless you want to use dual pistols.
7306	0	a	Call of Duty meets Coips and Robbers. APB Reloaded looked great to me at first glance, and the trailer sold it for me. Then however......I started playing.  Don't get me wrong, this game does have a few good things that can be said about it. They actually put some work into a base storyline, that I feel could have done well if it's gameplay counterpart wasn't a pile of sh*t. 1. There really are nearly infinte amounts of customization options. If you're the kind of gamer who gets hot and bothered when you can change the shade of colours you never actually see, you'll be here a while.... 2. Aesthetics. The graphics in APB are pretty good, even above par in a few ways. The voice acting is also better than most I've heard. 3. Options. You can play the way you want. Maybe grab a rifle and sit on a rooftop, or climb in a van with your buds, grab some SMG's and have a good ol' fashioned drive-by.  But, the negatives are there as well, and I feel they seriously outdo the pros. 1. Free to Play.......Pay to Win. No matter how much In-game Cash you grind by doing missions and getting epic multi-kills, you can never actually buy a weapon. You rent them for a week......a week! One would think that this time limit would at least make the weapon worth your hard work right? Wrong. Shell out $20 real world and you can get a gun that takes the entire in game shop and blows it's face off.......forever. 2. Vehicles. Remember the drive-by I mentioned earlier? You might wanna forget that....because you can't call what you do in an APB vehicle driving. Every vehicle is slow and unresponsive, on average it takes a second before the vehicle will start turning the direction you told it to. And when it does turn, it's like being on a Canadian highway in December! 3. AI. I know handicapped people with better mechanics than this. Park your car in the middle of the road and the whole city is like a Sim avatar stuck behind a chair in the kitchen. 4. Matchmaking. This could be put in both pros and cons actually.... The matchmaking system is very intuitive. It matches players based on in game 'Threat-Level' The higher this level, the better. However, this only accounts for personal achievements. Say you win 30 matches back to back, rockin' your starter rifle. You'll get an impressive Threat-Level. But some chotch who wins some and loses some might get put in a lobby with you, and he paid for his loadout. You stand little chance and the sysytem has no clue.  There are probably more things I could say about APB Reloaded, but at this point....I'm ranting. And you probably didn't even read this far anyway.
9298	1	a	I actually purchased this game a long time ago, and played it then, got distracted by some other really good games. But this one is online, and has the perks you get with an online game. Thru Steam it is Free To Play, and I can't seem to get the game to start. Did a file validation, there were 11 files missing. I already have an account with Fallen Earth, so I should be good to go, as soon as I get those 11 missing files. What could have happened? Looking forward to getting started again and I'll update my findings. Yay Steam.

7819	0	a	I played this game before it's official relaunch. However back then the game could barely run on any systems. Now after playing it on the relaunch only makes this title no justice. As it's full of cheaters and hackers with aimbot and wallhack. The game itself has awsome graphics for it's time and nice visuals. Somewhat large ``worldsÂ´Â´ to raom in tho they are 2 diffrent parts of the city of San Paro. But as said the game is now full of cheaters and hackers making this titel nothing worth playing. 
3766	0	a	Been playing APB on and off since the RTW beta, and I think I've finally quit for good. G1 has implemented some excellent and much needed changes, but so much has been broken in the process that I don't enjoy the game anymore. As I post this, server lag is worse than ever with rubber-banding ocurring every 5 minutes. Cheaters are still rampant and unchecked, and probably G1's biggest real-money customers to boot. New content that gets added is either nigh exclusive to max rank players or only on the ARMAS marketplace, meaning more casual players have no chance to even learn the strengths and weaknesses of new weapons. Let's not even mention how any semblance of gun balance went out the window as they kept pumping out more and more weapons to bloat the already full roles that the original content filled.  I could go on and on. Sure, APB gave me some of the best gaming moments I've had. Sweet bloody victory ripped from the jaws of a thousand snarling hellhounds, friendships forged in the hottest flames known to man, hatred so pure it would make a sith lord weep. The underlying mechanics are what I search for now in other online shooters, and the customization is still unmatched to this day. But all that said, let this poor old dog die. You will be fondly remembered for what you were.  RIP APB
5440	0	a	So I installed the game, then updated it, and then got prompted to create a 'gamersfirst account' in addition to my steam account to play this game. No thanks. You have this game on steam, so let me play it on steam, thank you very much.   Oh and by the way, if your game needs 47 minutes to update after you've installed on steam already, you're doing something wrong.   And the intro screen already lagged around. Just saying.
3879	0	a	So, I wrote a review about this game a while back. But seeing how I didn't play much of it, I thought i'd give it another chance. So I went over to a friends house who had a better built PC, and played it there. After all this time... Still sucks. It's just another Pay-To-Win grind-fest. You either shell out 30 bucks for a gun that probably isn't very good, or you play for weeks and weeks only to be able to buy some freaking shoes, or some other low-end customization thing. The player creation screen is still confusing as all hell. The guns are generic and firefights are just the same everytime. Controls are clanky and slow. Cars handle like theyre on ice. And now, there are hackers on basically every server. So... Have fun with that. The Devs seem to be completely out of touch with their 'Fanbase' because these have been problems for about a full 2 years. There are also never any sales or community events. that 99.99 DLC went on sale ONCE for 69.99, woa~~~~~h. Just don't waste time. Go play TF2 or Blacklight, something that's worth the effort
10040	1	a	Love this game, it absorbed me, I got lost in it for over 800 hours. Unfortunately though, I couldn't adjust to the PvP.  There were the regular PvPers that I could generally take in a fight, but then there were elites.... and a large portion of the games best late game content is in PvP zones which was both my favorite part and my least favorite. But if you're up for a challenging PvP late game, and an immersive dark wasteland environment with good stories and a well thought out crafting and market system, then this is a good game for you. :)
1727	1	a	This game is BEAST
9457	0	a	Ancient game. Horrible game company. Devs/GMs are actively the biggest jerks in the game.  So much better games out there.
6923	0	a	APB Reloaded, a game where you join bronze districts to mainly end up fighting silver and golds, join silver districts to mainly fight golds and gold districts to end up fighting no one. Also the matchmaking, its broken, I ended up fighting two golds who had r255 (rounds I assume) and I had r33, my team consisted of me and two other bronze players who were also on r33, so it was us three bronze players who were using the starter weps vs two golds who were using high level guns with three modifications on them and they were also using player modifications, I'd tell you who won but you should be able to guess.....At the core this is a good game, the mechanics are fun and enjoyable but with this matchmaking the game is just unplayable. For your own benefit don't play this game unless you play with friends or until they have fixed the matchmaking.
853	1	a	Very fun game but needs some improvment
4146	0	a	This game is very fun and very addictive, but it is just full of hackers and everything you work for just gets taken away or 'expired'. For a free game, it has potential to be one of my favorite MMO's. But I kept finding myself very aggrivated and upset that the guns or cars I worked to buy just 'expire'.  In my opinion, if you want to buy things for the game with real life money, then you will like this game. If you are looking for a good free MMO. Then I would not recomment this game.
7399	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥in sucks 
8865	0	a	Not worth the install in my opinion. When you look at this you think 'COOL! AN MMORPG JUST LIKE FALLOUT!' What you get: Hard to follow missions with rude players who are really into it just to troll the ***k out of you continuously until you either quit playing or get good enough to beat them to death in return.
7208	0	a	this game is f*cken â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, no wonder it was free.. Download time took forever, Load time..eternity.. Worst game ever. save yourself the time.
8444	0	a	Can't even play the game until I leave a Like on their facebook page?! Are you kidding me? Firstly how am I supposed to know if I like your game unless you let me play it first and secondly are you so insecure about it that you have to beg for likes before you let people see it? Uninstalled, pathetic.
2455	1	a	Recommended
3919	0	a	since the G1C spike and gamers first yet â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ another great P2P game i will say this.  this game is fun to a point... the game lags online syncing issues and also the fact that  Armas weapons and a variety of other things make this game unbalanced. not to mention  they are using PUNKBUSTER of all anti hacks that any script kiddie with the iq of a rock  can bypass and make aimbots ruin the overall experience. i blame the minor part of the  gamer community that plays FB games and the ever popular 'micro transactions' â¥â¥â¥â¥ up the rest of the experience for all of use. well here we go.. the games physics sucks... a small jump can turn your car over which seems to be a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing blimp with wheels.  animations or horrible. the other thing.... customization for free users to limited and requires you to get premium for a half way looking decent character. premium costs 5 dollars to 400G1C. also... your are going to hate people after playing this because the ammount of trolls and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s kill you with a  small burst from a smg or other fire arm while you have the dumb â¥â¥â¥ shit little 556 rifle they give you and expect you to kill something with it. so you get through the tutorial get a new gun play missions get new gear car etc.  the issue left is money you need alot of money get get anything decent. so formula higher rating you have more money you get, lower rating lower money. so.. hell if you have a few dollars anyways... and you dont want to listen to me go on play it.  but as a community ambassador i say to you not to play this filth please.... just dont there are so many better games out there... the community for this game is alright.. but trust me when i say this just dont bother.. sure its addicting and fun to play with freinds. but play it alone for a little when you play with freinds you will over look things but alone you will see why this game is terrible and how you die fast. i almost forgot..... weapons you buy WILL EXPIRE! you want weapons that dont expire PLAY THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING GAME GET A REWARD TO CHOOSE A â¥â¥â¥â¥ING PERMA WEAPON... sorry that is all good bye...

2407	1	a	This game is one of the best open-world games out there. It is often compared to GTA, but it is so much more than that. It has fully customizable characters and cars, big open-world map, and a social district completely for your customization needs. This game is way better than the way the people on here are making it out to be. It's free, so give it a try. You don't like it, your loss.
6259	0	a	For the love of god, don't do missions. In my experience there's a lot of P2W out there. Although the customization and the worlds are great, the PvP makes ArcheBlade look easy.

7784	0	a	To start off with, the game has its good parts and its bad parts, like every other game. But this game is not just like the others. I will start with the Pros. This game offers you the ability to customize clothing,cars,weapons as much as you want, and honestly, i haven't seen many games with so much customization. Its gameplay is one that will get you addicted. Now , for the Cons. Every one has heard of MMOs. They are supposed to let you customize and buy new content with in-game cash, and if you want to access some premium content to pay some money(for them to make some cash). This game has an incredibly greedy publisher, also known as Gamersfirst. They are all about money and they don't care about the players. The support is absolutely TERRIBLE. Their stuff added into the game is absolutely POINTLESS, as it adds more lag to the game and the framerate sometimes in a shootout can reach 2! For me, i have a great computer and high-speed internet, and it still happens. But it's not enough for this game. All these continuous patches make the game harder to enjoy, because it adds lag, as mentioned before. I've been playing this game for about 300 hours. I know that's not a lot, but i've added some cash into this for the premium, and i deeply regret it. I got my account hacked and when i contacted support all they said 'We will work on the case and we will inform you! Thank you for calling Gamersfirst!', and then they never got back to me with any news. I tried contacting again but they refused to help the second time. They didn't want to hear about it. Also the players in this game are acting like absolute garbage. You'll never get by without being criticized when you have a good score and you're owning the opposition. They will always say : 'You're a hacker!'; 'You're a noob!'; 'F*** YOU!'. In my opinion, and i think a LOT of you guys who have played this game, i think you will agree with me. THIS GAME IS GARBAGE!!
6170	0	a	JUST NO. Riddled with microtransaction. SUCKS BALLS. The pictures here are misleading. Horrible UI. JUST NO.

2341	1	a	In a Nutshell:  APB Reloaded is all I wanted from the original title before it went under and more.   The game is GTA Online on Steroids
6690	0	a	The free version is very hard to play. You are dead, dead, dead and dead. Running through the city with simple SMG, then someone with RPG blast you from behind. And again and again.

10742	1	a	its fun but youll break your computer if you play it. not because of the processing power needed but because of the rage
6809	0	a	while the game itself is good, with great character customization. it's a massively pay to win mess. you have to pay real money to get decent guns. and the only way to get those guns without paying them wheel barrels of cash are to get joker tickets. and to get those, you need to play for hours almost non stop in one of their special gamemodes. most likely against hackers. the pay to win vehicles that as far as i know, can't be bought with tickets, have massive built in ability that vastly out perform the non play to win vehicles. the community is cancerous that gives LoL a run for it's money. you will no doubt be accused of hacking at least once, regardless of if you're actually hacking. the actual hackers basically rule the game while gamer's first has money shoveled in from overpriced P2W ingame guns and cars.

5018	0	a	If you read any review, you'll discover the community is â¥â¥â¥â¥. There are thousands of reviews that point out all the flaws, and you've probably already read them. So, for those of you thinking to play, here is a list of the different categories of a.sshat you will find in this game:  -Low level â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s: wear all stock clothing, but are suspiciously good, and proceed to teabag everyone they kill -High level â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s: wear 5 layers of neon clothing, steal their parent's credit card to buy 6000 dollars worth of in-game guns -Subhuman stoner culture: A group of jackas.ses who wear leather jackets with cannabis leaves printed on them. Are annoying and likely have never touched a joint in their life -Trolls: people who fu.ck around and try to offend people with swastika patterns on cars and clothes. Probably the friendliest group. -11 year old kids with Asperger's: usually have in-game girlfriends (who are secretly catfish) and blast shi.t.ty dubstep in the social district. -Chat spammers: Ra.pe chat with annoying and useless text to one another. Rudely ignore everyone else and type so much that global chat has basically become their own private chat -The Man: The one guy, wearing all stock clothing, with no customized cars or clothes, who mysteriously has a f.ucking OSMAW and rap.es the sh.it out of everyone on the server, even the untouchable high-level p2w nerds. -You: The one, single, normal person on the entire server. Caught in a clusterfu.ck of a feud between all of the aformentioned groups.  Sounds like fun? Of course it does!
3131	1	a	Do you like spending real money over and over agian on the same game? Well this one is for YOU!! Friends are needed to play and have fun IMO, being the cops can be quite dull most times, and the crooks are ballin. The power of the darkside is everywhere, no one should be able to survive. He runs the underworld with a deathly fist. Why you ask, because it's raining .... raining upon my teary eyed face with no way to tell if you are Dead or Alive?!
8021	0	a	So hmm, this game is awsome, the features and combat system is amazing the only down about this game is that theres too many hackers. Idk if hacks are easy to get in apb but you can see one hacker in almost every missions u play
8034	0	a	if u are a gangster and you pop a cap a cap in a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s â¥â¥â¥ and get drunk on mountin dew then you have completed life
2860	1	a	this game is awesome 
1996	1	a	Too.... much..... time....... wasted....... *dies*
3868	0	a	Think League of Legends has a toxic community? You haven't seen APB's yet.  Also this game is terrible.
4048	0	a	this game is imbalanced if you are free to play. the match making makes no sense, new players getting placed against players with rocket launchers (advanced weapons).  Rocket Launchers take away from the whole 'cop vs Criminal' aspect of the game. i tried to get into this game multiple times with friends. each time we got turned off when we were placed against players who had better guns/equipment against us.  never understood this method of FTP, it is designed to discourage playing the game free. but in the end all it did was discourage me from investing in it.
7597	0	a	Once I got over the horrible sign in with Steam feature I watched some pretty dramatic videos that gave me a rough introduction to the dangerous world of San Paro. After choosing my faction (Criminal or Enforcer) I was pushed into a character customization screen. The character customization in this game is absolutely horrible. I would click on different traitrs and such to edit my character but it wouldn't change anything. Once I had exited and re entered enough times to find a decent pre set skin I jumped over to the next screen. Here I was supposed to name my character and chose a server to play on. I did so naming him of course Mackie D. and choosing the closest server however the game would not allow me to click next and begin the game. I waited thinking maybe my PC was running behind but nothing happened. The menu eventually faded into some sort of an idle screen and when I swivvled the mouse the server select returned. Still I could not get passed that menu and into the game. Since I can't even play the game I'm gonna have to say that I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME to anyone. Unless they have an idea on how to fix my problemo.
9773	0	a	the game dont starts 
8744	0	a	The game is so ugly!! How to hack my pc can't get on low damn 30 fps! That FPS drops and lagg!!  To start the game! That is during like 88 hour!! Pay To Play game!!! A lot of bullcrap!! Why are there womans in the game!!! Everybody knows they are smaller en harder to hit in fights!! Cutscnene's, crap!! Loadings screen also â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ie girls! People thinking I am watching porn...
8549	0	a	60 mins of play time with my friend.   10 mins of trying to figger out how the char maker works 5 mins making the char  roughly 10 mins to try and figger the tutoral out.  nothing said how to get money. or that money was sitting in the mail it just said check mail not (your â¥â¥â¥â¥ is in the mail) than moved on to the next thing  finaly figger this out and get my stuff good to go after about the 25 min mark  me and my team mate get going. 2 mins out. we get killed by one dude we go out again. this time find nothing and no one to do anything. 10 mins later we are swarmed spend the 20 mins dieing and dieing and dieing thanks to spawn campers who in fairness may not have known they were spawn camping.   2 cops agesnt 15 criminals  when no other cops in the area were helping  why am i a cop?  
6142	0	a	It would not run well on my computer and constantly froze.
8280	0	a	I played APB: Reloaded via the Gamersfirst launcher and at first I was in love.  The missions were challenging when you had to fight other players, the customization really let you show your creative side, and the music was amazing. You can even hear the music of players driving near you.  But the rental guns really got annoying considering the original APB had permanant weapons. The cops vs robbers theme was cool but the ratio is way off, there are far more criminals which makes sense considering criminals can make money about 4 times faster than enforcers.  Also there is or was little in terms of balance. You would often see gold ranked players matched against silver or even bronze players, resulting in a massacre.  All of the above was tolerable until the Armas Market was introduced. Offering permenant cars and weapons, all of which are slightly better than their 'free' counterparts, the Armas Market gives spenders a noticeable edge and ruins the game in my opinion.  Imagine getting matched up against a player, you have the exact same guns except theirs is cash shop (you can tell by the gold gun icon) and they have nearly tripple your firing range and seem to be able to kill you in half the shots despite wearing heavy kevlar.   To sum it up. APB: Reloaded is a relaunch of a failed P2P game with beautiful graphics, great character and car customization, and a horrible cash shop model. Due to the Armas Market, I cannot recomend this game to people looking for a good PVP mmo.
10544	1	a	ruined my life
7317	0	a	So I once had a good review of this game, but I have to change it I'm afraid.  I have well over 400 hours into the game (Played before it was on stea to track my hours) so I'm not someone coming in talking out of their â¥â¥â¥â¥ angry about pay to win.  I have spent money on this game  I have earned a lot of the same stuff outside of spending money  I have leveled both a Crim and and Enf 1 max one close to it.    This game is a shell of its former self, and really there is no game like it still, but you should still look elsewhere. I won't scream hackers, because they've gotten good at banning them, but there are still a few cases where it is far past questionable, especially from the same few people that somehow stick around (I've played long enough to know good from hackker).  I won't say the game is entirely pay to win, and this is coming from someone who HAS paid into the game, but I will say it has gotten damn close, especially the past year. New guns come out that you can only buy, their are not great earning eqvuilanets, and the few that are in some cases can take you as many hours as I have into the game, not including mods, and making the money to rent them constantly.  It isn't a terrible game, but sadly it is run buy a company that seems more focused on their shop than their game. Still the same tired maps this many years later, still the same tired missions that get old and are easily exploitable if you know them well enough (some sides WILL easily win if they are defending/attackin for example). The company running this game seems to have given up on impleneting anything new into the game outside of guns they sell you with real money, and seem to have all but given up on the idea of expanding the game or adding content, which is sad. Game STILL has potentially, simply because no one else does this really, outside of GTA 5 online, but the devs need to realize they are running a game server, not a cash shop.
2964	1	a	Looks so real
10913	1	a	Other then occasional lag ever now and again, there really isn't much wrong with this game. The concept is simple, but the game is fun no matter how long you want to play. You can play just for 5 minutes when you have some spare time, or you can play with friends for hours and not get bored. One of the highlights of the game for me is Oryx's castle. Once all of Oryx's minions are killed, he sends the whole server to his castle. The game also is completely free to play, and won't force you to spend hundreds on enjoying the game.
4297	0	a	The Pay 2 Win is Real in this one.
4656	0	a	What used to be a great game with lots of potential was bought up by a new company whose devs were there for the money, not the game. Now it's a mere shadow of its former self, filled to the brim with hackers and toxic kids, as the devs recycle old assets to churn out the last couple dollars they can get. I'd stay away from this digital landfill of a game.
9480	1	a	Like on other guy said. Clans need to be able to build their own base as they want. Its an post apocaliptic game. Having the ability to build a home in a ruinned place would be awesome other than that its a bit boring
7302	0	a	In the basic a real nice game with a solid gameplay and good mechanics.  Also the mission design is great with a lots of varieties.  But... The progress in this game is rather difficult due to the overhelming 'buyable' content. I had a lot of fun playing this game, but in the end was frustrated as i get killed by players with weapons you can't unlock through simply playing this game.  This game could have great potential to be a really great f2p game, but the unbalanced content, also the frustration you will experience while playing against some players who take all the posible buyable benefits, negate all positive experience.   In the end i do not recommend this game, unless you are willing to spend some $$ for a faster/better armored car and a weapon which is more accurate and does more damage than the free counterpart.   My last opinion on this. If there would be no buyable content (cars/weapon) but only cosmetical content like clothes etc. This would be a great game as a f2p. Right now it's one of the most wicked pay 2 win games i played in the last months
8774	0	a	I have been playing this game for a while now, and it was really fun until I join a financial server, then it brings me back to the menu saying my account has been permanently suspended. I'm just happy I didn't spend a single cent on this game.
4451	0	a	Matchmaking does not exist.  30 min in i started fighting gold rank people. Pay2Win (inbefore: OMEGED ITS NOT PAY2WIN LIRN TO PLAY). All gold rank people play in bronze/silver rank servers (gold rank servers are EMPTY, wonder where they all are hmmm, oh right).  You will be sniped from every corner possibe. Mission objectives will be taken on rooftops with 1 entrance where you will get rekt all the time trying to get up there. Much more can be added. I simply won't waste my time. Don't believe me? then proceed.
1305	1	a	I like this game. This game is for that people who haven't got money, because this is a f2p GTA, but this is a pay to WIN game. You can't buy premium (p2p) for pernament and without premium this game is bad for example: you can't customize your car and your charachter only 1 or 2 decals etc.
17	1	a	  Definitely one of a kind.    Don't be fooled with my hours played here in Steam, I actually have one character that has over 1,800 hours played. And did I mention that is just for one character? Not just that, but I've been playing this game since its Open Beta Phase during 2011, and that is even before it was released here in Steam.     1. Background   - The game was first released on June 2010 under the name 'APB: All Points Bulletin', where in the game design was led by David Jones, who created the original Grand Theft Auto. During this time, the game was subscription based. But on November 2010, the developer has announced that the game will be shut down due to lack of development process, management focus, and the desire to make the game better. But on March 2011, the game was revived and sent to Closed Beta where 5,000 players were invited. Then it has been released on May 2011 to Open Beta.    2. Graphics   - The game is still using an old engine, therefore in its current state even if you can run Grand Theft Auto V on the highest settings, you're still going to face some stutters here. But the developers have announced a roadmap for this year, and it includes an engine upgrade.     3. Content   - Most of the contents are recycled, weapons re-skins are common, and some are just brought back to life from the old development. The team currently doesn't have anyone who can animate as well.    4. Gameplay   - I'll be honest, it may look like a Pay2Win game for those who are new to the game because of the weapons that can be bought from the in-game cash shop called Armas Marketplace. Other than that, the game also has a very steep learning curve. Yes, it is pretty easy to play the game but it's actually hard to be good at it. Most of the time you'll be thinking your oppositions are using aimbots or triggerbots. But if you give it time, learn the different uses of each weapons, techniques on how to take advantages of the situation, learn the different tactics to win, and etc., you will be more than rewarded. Because let me tell you, stock weapons can beat the hell out of this paid weapons.    5. Customization   - Given the old engine, some parts of the customization may hinder you from what you're trying to achieve. BUT! Never have I encountered a game like this, you can literally create any designs you have in mind. You have a shirt in your closet that you want your character to wear? No problem, you can! But the only catch here is... You have to be good at it. This is one of the reasons why I'm still playing this game, it's because I can be who I want my character to be.    If ever you're interested in checking out some of the clothes/outfits/vehicles I made you may check them out  here.       6. Micro-transactions   - The only lifesaver this game has. The cash shop is pretty much expensive, why? You want a cool looking clothing pack that only consists of about 5 items, sure, just pay them 10$ for that. It even offers weapons that can be overpowered to those who are new.   Update: They have released packs that includes tons of new items bundled into one. The pack actually costs 40$, but if we're going to analyze the content, it's worth more than what they're asking.    7. Conclusion   - Even with my huge hours of playing this game, I also had some breaks. There are times that you just want to stop and get over it. But sooner or later, you'll find yourself searching for something to repalce this game. If you first thought that this is just another Grand Theft Auto clone, then you're wrong. I admit, at first that was also my first impression. Time goes by, I realized it is nowhere near it, it's a different breed of game.

8439	0	a	I played this a while ago and I can't really remember it so it was probably not that good
6176	0	a	Its a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥
3366	1	a	Really recommended game it has everything
3481	1	a	i have had a tons of fun hours and a ton of bad ones, but this game have super fun gameplay and amazing customization lvl both to your character and car. the down sides is minor compared to how fun it is playing.there is allot server issues, but every mmo have that form time to time. another bad thing is the community, (for me its a fun thing) all the fun hate whispers i have gotten over the years. sadly right now the devs is trying out some weapon mechanics that straight out destroying the game  and the devs takes months to fix obvious broken guns.
4153	0	a	I thought this game was very bad as the setup was very slow and i had isues installing it due to it containing a virus and hacking my firewall.
9412	1	a	Oh boy yes do I reccomend this game. The Combat system is a clever mix of Third/First Person Shooting/Melee like Skyrim or Fallout with some Tab Combat like WoW when casting Mutations (Basically spells for healing, damage and support) so you can choose to simply ignore one play style over the other or use a mix of one. If you want to dual wield two, one handed melee weapons or guns then go for it, the game allows you to even use a one handed melee and gun at the same time, basically filling melee and range in one go.  BE AWARE though that the mouse buttons are backwards, to use the weapon in your right hand click the left mouse button and vice versa. I haven't found a way to fix this without it affecting interactions with the world so my advice is don't change it.  The only flaws are the sound and beginners confusion. I personally found the ambience quite annoying and the game is very quiet out of combat but I suppose you could call it relaxing.  At the beggining of the game you follow a simple tutorial dungeon (with good voice acting) and then you get to pick one of three starter locations that tailor to how you would like to play.   You have a few starter quests which thankfully come one at a time but when you leave that slice of starter land and head into town then you'll find there are lots of quests that need doing. They don't appear very cleatly on the mini map so look hard and you'll notice little hazard symbols like the desktop icon bare visible on the mini map. Those are quest icons.  I did notice that the starter areas seem to follow a similar story at first, just in a different landscape.  One thing that really confused me was Tradeskills. I'm sure once I devote more time to the game and decide what kind of character I want to be I'll understand it better.  If you want a nice little MMO that puts the best features of WoW and Fallout into one then have a go...
678	1	a	mmm thats preety good 
9424	0	a	my PC is decent and manages to run alot of games but this one... nope it doesent even run smoothly on lowest graphics
4493	0	a	horrible. extremely â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ wanna be gta.
3400	1	a	It's pretty much the biggest Pay to Win game out there. Is it fun? With friends, Hell yeah!
8672	0	a	Well, the game is an good Game. BUT. There are many hackers in the game and seriously, this game is pay2win.  I payed more than 50â¬ and much work in it to trade my legendaries in this game. And i got banned from GamersFirst.  GamersFirst Support is just poor. They answer very quick, but never give you the best solution.  There are many overpowered weapons that never get patched. Thats the only thing that destroys the Game.  Im still playing the game, i enjoy it. Tho if it is really â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off.  I dont know why, but i just like it.  But this game, is Pay2Win and upâ¥â¥â¥â¥.  Dont play this Game if you dont like: Pay2Win, Hackers, Scammers, a poor Support, and reasonless Bans.
7851	0	a	Alright, so I downloaded this in 2 hours. I was all happy about playing. Started playing, I loved customization, but then, when it came to playing, it was horrible, Enforcers are OVERPOWERED, with the stun guns, it's impossible to play. Don't waste time. Play some real things instead.
10397	1	a	love this game, couldn't stop playing it at all. I loved all those missions that contained collecting stuff or killing enimies, even delivering stuff to another city which took fuel or food, (if you were on a horse). really love the leveling up system, nut what I really didn't like (that was the only thing) which was the auction house. The aution house was all about players that would pay to get their chips (the currency of the game) which was a whole lot for like a stupid item that everybody had already, and even the crafting material was expensive in the aution hause, but like I said that was the only thing that bothered me. Everybody should get this game so that we can all play together.
5580	0	a	This game is the worst game ever created. I don't know why anyone plays it anymore. It has â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ physics which makes the characters looks and feel like sims characters. The shooting on the game is so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dreadful that I'd rather play call of duty and don't mention the driving which is worse than crazy taxi physics. It's guns are really bad, and to get a decent weapon wouldn't you know... You have to pay, and it's on a loan most of the time so you gotta pay every week or so. Why would anyone play this game? I don't know... Maybe to get ebola or some â¥â¥â¥â¥. Please just think about playing Runescape or Super mario or nothing infact. Before you pick this toxic aids up.
6187	0	a	nah not my kind of game
3905	0	a	This game goes the extra mile for making everyone unique if you're willing to pay some money. That's not bad, but the actual game is. Controls are awkward and the sandbox maps feel grand at first but after exploring for a small amount of time I was already back where I had started. Aiming always feels off, and you have to focus way too much on it if you want to kill someone far away or not injured at all. Missions in sandbox mode are not always fair since they could match you with someone 4 times your level. This game could've been great but the gameplay and controls are sketchy and cars suck too. If you're bored on a weekend, try it, but if you're looking for a Saints Row here you are not going to find it at all. Three out of Ten.
1559	1	a	Great game. I wish i could play it
4605	0	a	Very bad experience wth this game: Launching this game messes up the whole steam client. Even after i close the game steam still shows it running in my status and everything else, now one would think as to restart the client to fix this but steam does not exit when a game is running, so it keeps requesting me to close the game first before exiting while it is already closed!(Also,you cannot launch the game again as it is already running according to steam)...sticky situation xD. then i have to use the task manager to manually terminate all steam processes and start steam again. Pretty tedious right? and this was just a single issue out of the many this game brings to the system. I could write about more issues but it would make this review too long, so in conclusion: very bad personal experince=would not recommend to anyone.
2840	1	a	this was my fist stam games 
5025	0	a	Worst game  dont waste ur time downloading it  best thing is uninstalling it
3189	1	a	If im being completely honest here, it's one of the most exciting games ive ever played. Yes At low levels and if you dont purchase items for the sellers it's quite hard to win missions but even the basic details like driving and looting bring a smile to my face
7862	0	a	I played this game before it's official relaunch. However back then the game could barely run on any systems. Now after playing it on the relaunch only makes this title no justice. As it's full of cheaters and hackers with aimbot and wallhack. The game itself has awsome graphics for it's time and nice visuals. Somewhat large ``worldsÂ´Â´ to raom in tho they are 2 diffrent parts of the city of San Paro. But as said the game is now full of cheaters and hackers making this titel nothing worth playing. 
710	1	a	ITS SO COOL and realistic and its FUN so DOWNLOAD IT AND PLAY !!!
744	1	a	Awesome Free Oper World Game!
3447	1	a	Loading simulator 2015   10/10 would wait again
8363	0	a	  It seems like a good game but i can't play it because the servers are amazingly bad. Unplayable.
3629	1	a	Not too bad. If you dont mind the lower graphics and no story, this game is good enough to be a substitute for those who dont have the money for Grand Theft Auto. DLC is a little expensive though.
1743	1	a	I think they should make this Mac supported :) Its a really good game and would be even better if everyone had access
6070	0	a	DONT BOTHER SPENDING YOUR MONEY, I HAVE ENCOUNTERED THE AIMBOT HACK MYSELF FOR A TEST RUN.... GM'S AND ALL OTHERS DONT CARE WHO CHEATS, THIS GAME HAS GONE TO â¥â¥â¥â¥... SAVE UR TIME &amp; LIFESTYLE HABITS.
1766	1	a	LOVE THIS GAME! I love to take my rage out on random people.
6586	0	a	After some time playing APB, and spending some money on 30-day premium account, I would not recommend the game. The game is full of hackers, the matchmaking is awful. Gold-rated players vs Bronze-rated players. The server lags every 5 minutes. The 'comunity' is full of annoying and toxic people. For new players, the game is non-friendly.  If you plan to buy guns, vehicles or stuff like that, for 30-day or lifetime, prices are way too high. I find the developers so greedy.   However, the game has a lot of customization chances, and the open world, free roaming and missions are good. But they don't justify the game itself.
7354	0	a	I try and play it and my computer says that it's already running when it's not
3646	1	a	I guess im the only one who likes this game? I just drive around the city really.
102	1	a	+ It's a good game, graphics are amazing and it's multiplayer. - It's hard to drive and make actions. + Criminals makes easy cash - Enforcers steal your stuff to earn cash on it + Private Cars - Public vehicles can be stolen from you with the loot in + Free to play +++ BRUTAL multiplayer game with Constant action all the time  Rating: 7/10 Additional comment: The gameplay is awesome, I love this game. There are only 2 things that annoyes me: #1: Other people stealing your car if it's not private... #2: Enforcers busting you in action... They can easily catch you up if you don't have driving skills
3022	1	a	i wish i could play it all i get is a black screen and i can see the main menu flashing.......i think
7007	0	a	There is no learning curve, there is a level curve. The match making is non existent so you will constantly get people who are miles ahead of you equipment. The only way to catch up is lose enough missions to level up maybe after a month you can finally catch up and play with the good equipment. Highly recommend playing with freinds and not alone.
4154	0	a	There was once a time when this game was full of potential with lots of promises made to the playerbase. Now that potential is wasted and lots of promises forgotten.  Its all pay to win with endless grinding for those not willing to invest hundreds of euros in to this dying game.  Really awesome customization though. Gotta pay for that premium first though.  And then some.  But after all that said. I've had much love for this game since the real time worlds first launch. Even though it is repetive to the max there was something that kept you going to the next mission and try again.
5790	0	a	This is a game where cash is king, and not in game cash, I mean real cash, I dont want to spend big bucks for better weaponry and cars, this game would be good if it wasnt this way and the dlc was less pricey more guns were available ingame,same with cars, and a easy to understand tutorial too
786	1	a	It's like a GTA, but online.Visual very realistic and you can make tatooes,change cars and sounds.
4995	0	a	Character creation was fun.  That was all the fun this game had to offer.  Edit: Honestly, yeah, I'm an APB scrub-- and for a reason. This game is purely all show and no go just as much as it is a pay-to-win scheme of a game. (And based on your hours, I guess you fell for that.)   The developers would much rather keep their blockheaded playerbase happy with updates that exclusively include more guns rather than EVER updating the game's engine or fixing/ adding onto APB's bland as balls gameplay. I mean, don't get me wrong, I guess I can see that driving around and doing the same â¥â¥â¥â¥ over and over again could be amusing to some people. But I feel like that's just a very small demographic of likeminded people who require little to no mental stimulation.   This game literally offers nothing new or innovative and the hours you'll spend on it before realizing that there's nothing more to it, are spent making up characters or customizing other things.   I don't know. Say what you will, but every other review for this game just rolls over the same points I just made.   TL:DR I'm a scrub but this game still sucks donkey â¥â¥â¥.  Abridged Version for the APB: Reloaded Playerbase:  'yo, y u spendin' yo money on dis gaem when dere nothing 2 do lmao dis girl buggy as hell an she aint got no game, playa.'

6253	0	a	GTA Clone, ruined by cheats and limited missions
10720	1	a	I see a lot of reviews not recommending this game because they say it's 'pay to win'. I don't agree with this at all. I've played this game quite a bit, not only through steam but through the website itself as well. I think the reason people believe it's pay to win is because of the starting area, where the new developer put the option, right where you spawn, to purchase very high tiered gear with coins, which can only be bought with real money. I don't think this is the best idea, because it imbalances the economy some and also encourages people who don't know what their doing to spend money on this equipment, only to lose it soon after by dying in this PERMADEATH game. That said though, this DOES NOT make the game pay to win. All of this equipment is obtainable through looting or trading with other players for other loot. There aren't many things that can ONLY be bought with real money, and these things are mostly clothing dyes, alt skins, food items to grow your pet faster then normal, and things like character slots or inventory space. Not having these things won't really detract from your experience playing this game, and it is definitely not pay to win. Maybe pay to get ahead slightly faster, but not pay to win.   With that out of the way, I can definitely recommend this game. Like I said above, I've put many hours into this game because, put simply, it is a lot of fun. It's a fast paced bullet-hell permadeath shooter mmo that also just happens to be free, and there's no risk in trying it out.
3125	1	a	The customization on APB:R is insane, you can make your vehicles and character look any way you would like. For the most part the missions are fun if you can overlook all of the server lag (Joker-East) and the OP weapons that you can purchase through the in game market with real money. I have put a ton of hours into this game and as much as I hate playing it with the server lag/hacker issues it is still a really fun game to play. *I am not calling everyone a cheater either but there are a select few that still roam the joker server every now and again.* I would recommend this to anyone that was wondering about it because it can be a really fun game to play if you really have nothing else to do.
2308	1	a	a very fun game of cops and robbers, sometimes frustraiting with the pay-to-win method of the game but its fun all over all teamgame.
5924	0	a	i bought 20$ worth of premium and then the next day this update happens now when i click start nothing happens!!! i want my game to work or i want my money back!
10603	1	a	So simple, so cute, so... intense and hardcore. Bullet-hell MMO in pixel-art with permadeath. Better in small doses, otherwise it gets too repetitive. Dive in for 30min to 2hours, it's free.
3355	1	a	Grills, kills and glitches. +300 rep for grills -100 rep for glitches 9/11 points
6414	0	a	Pay to win
931	1	a	  plz fix game freezing ;-;
557	1	a	Love the customization of the game
1883	1	a	Love this game. It's a nice twist on cops and robbers. The addition to being able to arrest criminals is awesome IMHO. If you're looking for a good Cops vs Robers kidna game this is it.   The only con I have with this game is that at times it will freeze and force you to restart your computer unless you disable all but one audio device.
6299	0	a	dont play this game
5253	0	a	its â¥â¥â¥â¥
3199	1	a	10/10 would uninstall again
7294	0	a	Infuriating game. It can actually be great fun, especially with friends. But not only is APB severely crippled by stupid game design, the engine is atrocious. Expect ridiculous lag making the game unplayable, crashes to desktop or even crashes that lock up your entire system. Support for this game seems nonexistent too - these problems have been going on for years now.
5444	0	a	can log on
1522	1	a	The best mmofps game ever, really.  I agree to people saying 'game is ptw blah blah blah' BUT there are a lot of weapons already to choose which works very good, just you need skills, TBH didnt play this game for 1 year, then downloaded and i still had skill to be on top with 40 kills in a mission lol.  Matchmaking is really â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, there are always people matched in groups which has everything maxed out... This game would be the best if it didnt have threats... No gold, bronze or silver, because of this matchmaking is â¥â¥â¥â¥, there must be only one order of ranks, like csgo, has and other mmo games.  Game is really competetive, and as i said, its the best one you will ever find as mmo fps as you can drive a car do some crazy stuff. I am running on pretty old pc sure using some low settings, but game is still having some laggs even people says that on even a gaming pc this game would lag, and im waiting for an update for engine... so yeah. Devs should look more into quality not into money.
3348	1	a	Instead of 'Gamersfirst' it should be renamed to 'Wallets First'  8/10
7494	0	a	I wouldnt recommend this game, it has way too many 'griever' players who enjoy ruining the game experience for you, blocking your escape with their van or trapping your car so that you can't use it, ramming you with their cars when you are in middle of your mission while they are not part of it, 'ghosts' who reveal your position to to hostile players while being invunerable to any damage due to fact not being part of the 'fight'.  But if you enjoy being harashed by those who are bored or just seek to troll you, then be my guest and have fun at the game,I've played it, I've enjoyed it, but I have better things to do than vent my frustration to occasional cheaters with unlimited car carry capacity, one shot five kills weapons, servers being full all the time, and more over being teamed with low tier people who has no idea what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ to do and refuse to show or participate on teamplay and seek to solo it making it harder for the rest of the team.
8190	0	a	I try and play it and my computer says that it's already running when it's not
5995	0	a	  SO i logged on earlier...and no one was online NO ONE!
7017	0	a	Not going to get into the problems, but this is a very flawed gem if you like these types of games. MY GRIPE Is it doesn't seem to be workig since I upgraded and got a new rig with a GTX 960. It appears others have issues with this and there maybe compatability issues with this GPU and APB that should be fixed
7360	0	a	Going into APB Reloaded, I expected an alternative to GTA. One that had many traits that made GTA so successful. If you've ever played any of the GTA titles, you know what I mean. Anyways, this game is a very big download, so please, be prepared to wait. Once the game finally launched, you decide which faction you'd like to be apart of. Criminals, or Law Enforcement.   Each is unique in it's own way. The character creation is extremely in-depth, I'll give the game that.   But the main question is, is this game a good alternative to GTA? In my opinion, no. The game takes way to long to load, around 6-10 minutes EVERY time. The story line is hard to understand, and the game is very much Pay-to-win. You can tell within the first 15 minutes of playing the game. The game is NOT newb-friendly. In missions, if you are a low-level it is extremely hard to find a group that wont kick you out. You can't use planes, boats, ships, or anything for that matter. The only thing you can do, is hijack cars.  The ONLY joy I had in this game was hijacking cars, and shot random civilians. Which is one shot, instant kill. No matter what. It takes forever to become wanted by the police, and when you are, a big clash ensumes. Awsome right? Nah. I crashed every time I entered a deathmatch.  Overall: 5/10: Don't get this game.  Sum-up: A very limited, stripped down, version of GTA.
196	1	a	First ever real F2P Shooter , u dont have to pay cash to enjoy the game , its all about skills and teamwork , 7.5/10 worth playing
8149	0	a	I'm playing on a 2500 dollar game rig that was built within the last 6 months. With my setup this game plays for â¥â¥â¥â¥. I can barely get 20 fps during combat. Customisation is amasing, though. I hear it's p2w, but I can't confirm as I can't really play it.
7477	0	a	Populated with 12 year olds and pay to win. Don't even bother.
1881	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ 
10751	0	a	It wont let me in the game at all with my steam account nor will it allow me to sign in with another account, I fairly enjoyed this game until it decided to give me the shaft so hard that my face looked like a war head wrapper. So No for me to put it shortly.
2056	1	a	Cops and Robbers, GTA style. What's not to love?   In-game midi sampler to create your own 'theme' In-game MP3 import system for car radio F2P Customisations only limited by number, not customisation.   Only thing is 250ms+ latency makes some missions unplayable, especially against those near the US Datacentres.
2583	1	a	VERY FUN GAME and now with steam the player base has increased by 3 million get this game its is very beastly
6260	0	a	i do not recommend this game its a terrible game the controls are all wonky and half of the games controls dont work super buggy game do not download this game
2947	1	a	This game can be repetitive on long gameplay but you have at least 10-20 hours of pure fun. GTA style, this game combine a good coop/pvp system with free roaming. There is also a lot of costumization about dress, cars and other stuff. FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
3149	1	a	Ya this is a kool experience in itself.
6249	0	a	i really wanted to play this game but my video card didnt meet the requirements
224	1	a	This game is really fun and keeps me wanting to come back and play after months! That's what my friend told me, I wouldn't know though because I can't run it.
5432	0	a	GTA 4 wannabe game without the polish- effectively just a turd. There litterally is no purpose in the game, microtransactions. Not worth the 10$ in bandwidth to download it!
7590	0	a	This game have lag and its impossible to stay alive.You play 1 minute and you are dead.Really now,this game sucks.I don't recommmend this s***
344	1	a	BEST GAME FTW   i like this game a lot playing it no life because i cant stop. i have to many fun in this game   only thing is steam acthviements or something like that doesn't work for me so i got only one its glitch but np   I RECOMMEND THIS GAME
3736	1	a	Overall 7/10  Pros: +Customization is very well put into focus +Level of detail is amazing of the level/word +Music is good (few annoying songs plus you can maek your own mixtape) +Lots to do +Decent economy (no WoW farming money) +In-game market +Localization (havent met a person from another country/timezone) //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ Cons: -Pay 2 Win (some guns are way to OP and takes a 200 hour account to earn them on a F2P) -Premium is a option to buy for boosted stats and more cusomization -Broken world loading (empty servers of crims doing ram raids) -No Bulletdrop/Sniper rifles being way out of range but having the ability to 2 shot people (weapon in balence) -Cheaters (F2P game obviusly there will be some) -No large scale missions (server wide missions) -G1 has decided to run this more of a side business (Updates are usually seasonaly and only add more store features) //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ Want to play a true version of this look up 'APB EMU .com'  (http://apbemu.com/)  when this releases I will most definetely be spending time on this.  Reccomendation: Look at 'Identity rpg' that is a mix between Arma 3 and GTA V  (http://www.identityrpg.com/)  this looks and feels like a nice mmorpg when it will get relaesed if you can wait for another year or so.
3744	1	a	Pro:  I wouldnt say this is the best game righ now, but this game is amazing. It has a great potential to be the best open mmo open world game ever and rise to the top. It has a crazy customization feature and a smart world system where you can socialize, play with friends, a different server to play against each other or talk in virtual world. Literally nice concepts........   Contra: But yeah, This game needs an anti cheat, fix some issue &amp; glitch, a more fair gameplay and to do a lot of fun stunts, expand the world with more vehicle and AI
10706	1	a	beware of bunnies in the mad action mega non-platformer top down shoot em up rpg with levels and stuff! as you quest in a bunch of really big cave things with planets in them you gotta try to beat the mad god eventually. try to level up fast because youll randomly get sent to fight him sometimes  or if you want you can just bail and play tag ]  also join guilds and stuff  and battle in an arena i havent seen yet  its really neat     also you can get drunk its funny 
4120	0	a	Game itself is pretty cool its like an open world online GTA but i have to warn you.. Don't even think about playing it untill another developer manages the game since the current one is f*cking greedy as f*ck while not caring about the game itself at all.
53	1	a	The game itself is good, open-world. You can create your character, customize it, choose to be the Enforcers or Criminals. You can customize your car, your clothes, your stats, weapons, etc...   The bad parts: ALERT* Toxic and bad community, 80% Hackers. Fairfight's ban's everywhere... ** Random server lags or server going down. *** Very unbalanced matchmaking **** Pay2Win but still you can get your items, but requires alot of time, luck? and skill?  Well... The game is still fun to play with your friends so... 6/10
7893	0	a	Horrible game and company dont waste your money...both me and a friend got banned for absolutely no reason...we hadnt even PLAYED the game in over a year, suddenly we get on and their fairfight system bans us the second we log off? thats cool.  I spent like 3-400$ on this game, never playing their games again.  Email them try to follow up, and they basically say 'that sucks'  Started playing the game(looking over emails here), on 11/2/2012, never made it out of silver, never got any crazy stats with any of my weapons, i was better with some that others obviously but eh.  Then after almost 2 years of completely ON AND OFF play(mainly BECAUSE of hackers running around in the game), my friend gets on tells me about the fairfight system, and how he has not seen any hackers since, i get excited i hop on, play literally 1 mission log off and boom.

2723	1	a	This game is super fun!!! I love the multiplayer and the character costumization. The guns in the game are really unique because theres such a wide variety of them so it will take a long time to use every gun. Also this game is not a pay to wing game so thats a positive. I give this game 5 stars. Such a good game!! :D

2154	1	a	go game laggy tho 
4783	0	a	This game nearly destroyed my computer! It is so buggy and so unorganized that I could not do anything, play with any of my friends, most of the time I couldnt play it at all. It takes half of your lifetime to get it downloaded and logging in takes up more time than me actually playing this piece of trash. I had to turn my computer off 4 times in 2 hours because it froze my computer or prevented me from playing anything else. I feel like an old person after how much time I've wasted trying to give my effort purpose. How could Steam even consider bringing this horrible mess into their beautiful community of great to way better than APB Reloaded games. Gaben hear my words you awesome god and burn this evil game of devil spawn at the stakes, please.
6723	0	a	created an account...played this game..said i was too young to play..wouldn't let me..15...yet i still made the account....there's no way to delete it...soo...i'll never get to play it..thumbs down
8359	0	a	The worst tutorial
1715	1	a	My favorite game of all time. been playing for 4 years now.
6442	0	a	boring as â¥â¥â¥â¥ and considering people can just bunny hop with smgs to kill me it's certainly unbalanced as hell.
664	1	a	 First of all, I would like to say I have not spent any real money on this game. I haven't bought any DLC or In-Game Purchases.   Me and my friends really enjoy this game. We love doing missions together, and having to take down enemies. We definatley reccomend it, you don't have to pay to have fun.  Here are some reasons to try out the game -    3 Huge Maps   Ride in teamate's cars   Heaps of Character Customization   Vehicle Upgrades   Realistic Models   Crews - Paint your emblem on your car/clothes   Loads of Weapons   Fast pace shooter action   Dozens of cars to unlock and buy   Shooting out of car windows   You can smash into stores and rob them   Emotes   Good Sound FX   Play your own music in cars   You can be police and arrest people   Good amount of national servers   Alot of co-op missions against other teams   You can sometimes play missions by yourslef with no enemies   You don't need a beast computer to run it  
1900	1	a	I'm McLovin this games ! Once. Been a long while since I login. Gettin n00b. I will be back. Much customization in games and fun gameplay. One of the best customize I ever encounter. Need a good teamwork or frens to truly enjoy the games though.
7410	0	a	Crashes to much as soon as I get in game  
5628	0	a	This game is good apart from it takes ages to load and i cant even play it at the moment cos it keeps having to download directx
7507	0	a	Be all you can't be, in this game everyone wants to be a hacker.
2288	1	a	Ok so I have been kind of addicted to this game for over a year now. Its my first venture into a true PVP game. The community is ok once you find other players willing to help teach you the game and play along your side until you get the mechanics figured out. The match making is pretty bad and there are alot of people who play in zones where they don't belong (you will have issues with getting killed alot and not getting many kills when you start) out once you figure it out and you keep in the back of your mind that this is only a game and you don't rage quit it turns out to be pretty good.
8484	0	a	There is no such thing as headshots on this game. Shoot a guy in the head with a sniper and he will laugh and kill you with an automatic rifle while you reload. It seems like every window on the cars are bulletproof. The physics of this game are so messed up.   There is rarely any PvE which is fine. All your missions will be done against the opposition. This makes it hard for a beginner to get sold into the game especially when you have all the seasoned players crowding the newbie district. The tutorial is poor and doesn't explain some of the important mechanics like how to aim-outside-the-window of your buddy's car while he is driving. The elitist get mad when you don't play the game how they want you to play it. Its like they have their own little code of conduct.   I was looking for a clone to replace GTA but I guess I would rather play GTA instead. If you are expecting this game to be an alternative to GTA then you will be disappointed. The only thing this game has going for it is the customization(character, music playlist, guns, cars, and etc). Other than that, the game will make you mad and wish it would improve. Game has potential but the mechanics just are not fit for me.
8180	0	a	If you love COD or anything like it and can get down with customizing , this is the game for you.  That being said, i can't stand this game anymore. The set up is awesome, the customization is awesome, the map lay outs are detailed and super expansive. But the matching system is broken. As a newbie you can easily find yourself up against the best of the game right from the start. There are servers dedicated to different player ranks but it hardly matters. The gun you start out with is an ar that might as well be a airsoft. when your enemy comes at you with a bazooka. While the developers have done what they can to make this game fair for everyone they really over looked certain aspects.  Hit boxes are a joke, there are no critcal hit (headshot) areas, your just one big block. oh and even if your character is small, your hit box is still the same size as if you made the largest possible character.  the weapons in the game are exspansive, and while you can TECHNICALLY get any gun that anyone else has, it requires some serious dedication to unlock them all, let alone rent them&lt; (yes RENT) but even then someone always seems to have a better gun than you some how, and with no way of knowing what others are using, good luck guessing what to aim for. Speaking of aim, recoil is HEAVY in this game. sure might make it realistic but when it destorys the point of a weapon. for instance, loads of sniper rifles in this game, problem? none of them are 1 hit kill (which is obviously an attempt to balance the game) but the recoil on them is so heavy you will never get your second killing shot off in time to get your target unless they are inexperianced (which is rare) as such SR are rarly used. the most common gun use you will see are assult rifles, light machine guns, and anything explosive. any other gun is a waste of your time , and of course those are some of the hardest weapons to get the best of. my main beef with this game is the combat, simply from being completly out classed as a new player with no way to train up and become better except to be fodder for everyone else and lose match after match. however i must also state, the driving controls are pretty wonky as well, very easy to flip over your car from taking a slightly too tight turn. Enemies also make heavy use of the slightly broken vehical issues. like being able to blow up your car, with you in it, to get that 1 hit kill. or hiding key items in a spawned car that you cant access and waiting for the timer to tick away. its a pretty low tactic but one that works so well, its common. the last thing i will say is there is a prestige/notority system thats in place. once someone reaches 5 stars on either a bounty is placed on them and the entire other faction can kill them, or at least can try. Which when the 5 star person decides to storm the noob tuturial spawn point there is no one there strong enough or quick enough to stop them and they slaughter every enemy in sight! as they can also kill everyone on the other faction as well. i spent a good 5 minutes dealing with that till one of my factions stronger players came along and put them down. while this game has many makings of fun times, the imbalance issues are just too much for me to over look. and seeing as this game from release is 3 years old, i dont think things will be changing much. 
5848	0	a	  Pros- Customization You can earn money within time Fun like gta Free  Cons- Pay to win game Can only rent guns Glitchy Gamepasses cost to much Laggy Bad community  Overall No just No

2750	1	a	Endless playing. Very dynamic. You can never get bored playing, theres lots to do
6388	0	a	This game haves great potential if it would be in the right hands but this isn't the case and I doubt it will ever be. It was somewhat good back in 2010 and 2011 I at least enjoyed it and so did lots of my friends after that starting back in 2012 it went all downhill. The managment is idiotic, the new devs are once again untalented uncreative idiots, servers suck s-y â¥â¥â¥ and the list goes on. Instead of fixing the f-g game they ignored the issues and implement more issues by every f-g patch. Armas shop guns are pay to win bs and get tweaked by a new weapon release so obvious bs. Lots of players obviously left due to all these issues. I really wish someone good enough will take over this project because as it is now it's a pile of rotten s-t and there's nothing left. I really loved this game but they just destroyed it and took a s-t on it as a cherry on top. GF and RP I hope you f-king die in a longest pain.
6862	0	a	The game play component has two modes, join a mission district and press k to get shot at, or join an action district and have the game press k for you, so you can get shot at sooner, as well as having more people to shoot at you. As for the ranking system, with the aid of mommys credit card it can join the plot over in the corner, ever so often clear its throat and stretching a little , and mumbling something along the lines of 'this game isnt pay to win, you can unlock all the weapons as you progress through the game' to which you will reply 'what about the weapons i cant unlock through the game' right before resumes its silent vigil. All points bullitin caters to a unique few, the extremely rich, the extremely close, and the devs, the cash shop redundifies any and all attempts at proggression, while also placing some out of reach weaponery into the game, as for the joker store...suffice to say its a joke (see what i did there). All Lag Bullitin has optomization issues, that would give the dialup era of online gaming a run for its money when it comes to unreliability, the server is secretly the worlds most advanced rng as it has awareness, but many years of neglect have lead it to become resentful of humanity and thus you will find in your moment of need, when you are soo close to murdering Xx_rApEdyeMUMm8_xX and restoring honor to you family the server will get distracted and forget to register... well anything, and after a quick game of he said she said you are shuffled along to the respawn screen, the game is horribly unreliable unless you the lucky few, then you have nothing to worry about youll be sything down noobs and veterans alike blessed by the almighty apb god we call server, with the lag armor. Having said all this there are some good points to apb such as the customization.... yup thats the only redeeming quality, if this were a fashion world simulator it would be enough, but in a badly optimized tps (third person shooter) it just means you'll look pretty while your ragdoll lays on the floor, and theres not much else to redeem the game.  in conclusion the devs are bad, the game mechanics are bad, the servers are bad, the community is   toxic garbage, left behind by the civilized word, gained sentience and decided to stage a perverse mockery of a community   bad, the funeral clothes creater is indepth and well designed.    TL;DR the games bad, unless you spend your time in bronze, then you can enjoy countless hours of blissful ignorance, while you skip along to the sound of angry 12 yearolds
2551	1	a	fun as all â¥â¥â¥â¥! this game is what gta should have been!
771	1	a	So, If you like getting frustrated or yelling at your computer who did nothing to you..this is ya game, dawg  There's a love-hate relationship with this game so if you..y'know what, I'm going to go get some taco bell. â¥â¥â¥â¥ this.

6438	0	a	This game could have been great if they got rid of the pay to win system. It has a fantastic character customization and average graphics but the god danged pay to win system comes to f*^*k up the game
7647	0	a	I know the game is free. I know this. Does it mean I have to forgive it for being crap? No.  This game is exactly what I would expect from what is essentially a free-to-play Grand Theft Auto. Everything feels about ten years old, there is lag and general bugginess, and not a sh*t was given by anyone else as to whether the objectives were being carried out.  I didn't play a ton, but sometimes when you experience something, you are able to read it for the best that it could be independent of the momentary experience. This game doesn't have the capacity to entertain for the long term. Free-to-play games rarely do, though I feel I do have to mention Counter-Strike as one of a few exceptions to that rule. To be fair, though, this game is much newer than CS, and yet learns nothing from it or games like it.  This game seems more or less like a controlled environment from which get trolled other people than a legitimate attempt at entertaining; I knew that the first time that I attempted to kill the person with the briefcase, only to be shot from a vantage point directly above me that I had no hope of approaching from any other direction.  Take it for what you will - I played the game as long as I could stand to.
8213	0	a	Doesn't f****ing work on some Laptops, PC's and Mac's. Espically my Laptop. Reloaded Games fix this, or steam fix this. ITS SO ANNOYING!
3232	1	a	Fly around a big city, act like a gangster, pwn noobs trying to break the law, GG.
7665	0	a	The plot is â¥â¥â¥â¥, because there isnt really one, and the servers never â¥â¥â¥â¥ING WORK!
1080	1	a	Ive been with this game before it came out on steam and when i first came out the amount of progress that have got into this game is amazing im still playing this game and i wont stop playing until all servers are shutdown or n new stuff comes out but yes i recommend this game  Pros and cons Cons: The game is really hard to play and you need to have Voce communication Its recommend for this game and that you also need to put time into this game when you start out You will die alot but over time you will become good at this game  Pros: The Customizeing in this game is out standing you can go into so much detail into this game its unbeliveable also with the graphics are old but they still look good the Car driving is also amazing ome cars are really hard to controll but you can get used to it easyliy You can play with Freinds also You will be able to roam any where in the world and you will be able to join in events to earn quick and fun rewards after completeing the event   Now theres a couple of bugs with in this game like sometimes seeing green background or the audio is Cracking up or you will see the servers are down but theres 30 people in the server the server is still up you can still join just saying   I HOPE THIS REVIEW WAS HELPFUL HAVE FUN PLAYING :)
6360	0	a	it suck
205	1	a	I'm going to go ahead and play the optimist on this one. Try it for a bit till you get mad at it, because you'll probably still get mad at it as you go on.   Though as you can probably see, i likely didn't miss much from when i stopped playing it.  As it was, I found myself having to go shirtless and run amok through the town, doing GTA like BS.  That was true to a point. If you were on a sever with low cops, you could go nuts. But on a populated server, you could just miss a turn and hit a store by accident and the player cops would be on you like flies on â¥â¥â¥â¥.  While i'm sure they rebalanced things, back then it was more advisable to kill yourself countless times than to fight back.  Anyway, again, try it for a week or two, get mad at it and wish you hadn't.
9692	0	a	I fully do not recommend this game. For the past six hours I've been trying to get this game to update past 2.35 and every time the game will pop up with a fatal error or the program will stop responding. I've posted on their Facebook whats going on, I'm not the only one who has been having this problem and no one will answer us about it. Other then that part the game looks pretty interesting but good luck actually getting it to run
4928	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dammmit every single time i try to play it it keeps on screwin up
1442	1	a	Nice game :)
7231	0	a	I have not play the game yet even though that it says I played 1.3 hours, the game just wouldn't start, it ran even with my computer shut down. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ANYONE! This will change when the developers fix what ever problems this game has. I got interested by watching YouTuber Rapid99 play this.
8975	0	a	Hard to follow, Hard to play and hard to control. even worse is the fact that they haven't bothered to add any fighting or damage sounds so half the time you could be getting shot and not even realise!!
9341	0	a	The games web site Fails to allow the player to make the account in the first place rendering the game pointless
1661	1	a	Best game ever 9/11 unforgettable if you thought dota was a good game w8 till you get your hands on this
8898	1	a	Crafted ammo and I earned a horse 10/10 would craft again
3296	1	a	I Think Is A Bit Like GTA That Is Free To Play! But Remember That If Its Free To Play It Want Be That Good But I Still Have A Lot Fun Playing it Specialy With Someone :D Its Cool Get It If U Don't Belive ME!!!!
10807	1	a	Thanks Deca games.Make this game great again!
6997	0	a	This game is full of ****. They rip you off of all of the money that you pore into this game. I spent some money on it and I never got my G1 credits.
9345	1	a	Pretty Good.
5530	0	a	this is a kind of a Pay 2 Win game ,if you want items :better play for 4 years or buy them .don't download
5783	0	a	'Oh man this game looks awso-' Got headshoted in the head by a sniper. *respawns* 'Alright! let's g-' gets a pellets from a shotgun in the back. *respawns* 'Just give me a mome-' gets blown up by a rocket launcher. *respawns* 'What the fu-' Gets ran over. *respawns*  'Ok â¥â¥â¥â¥ this gam-' Gets banned. Morale of the story: Just give up. Besides music and customizations, this game doesn't hold anything intersting. And though it seems like I don't know anything about this game in my 16 hours of gameplay, I have another 200+ gameplay hours from an older account that I played it back in 2013, and trust me, this game almost hasn't changed a bit since.
5271	0	a	11/10 i will launch it again
10180	0	a	Its ok, however the price of items of of merchants is way too high. The game features way too much grinding to do anything so its not worth it.
1379	1	a	-Get some police on me -get some drugs -rob a bank -buy some guns -buy explosives -kill some civillians -go home and play APB Reloaded.  GG 101/10
9357	0	a	This game is actually awful i'm glad i didn't have to pay for it.
10106	1	a	Its awesome, It has a sense of realism, and best of all, Its FREE.
1585	1	a	My neighbours complain when i die.
5221	0	a	eh. its like gta but pay to win.
9899	1	a	its REALLY. i mean REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEALLY laggy close to the start of the game. im not going to give any spoilers but close to where u meet the first people that tha help u. im talk extremly laggy. but mabey it can be fixed in the otions, how knows, but i sorda like the idea of the game
4868	0	a	It dosent even let me play the game correctly
4300	0	a	Good game, requires alot of skill. Alot of cheaters in game.
9913	1	a	Perfect game for absolutely free. It is a game right at you finger tips if you like genre.
7863	0	a	This game dont work! Dont have servers online ?! Ok! I dont recommend this game !
8311	0	a	God Awful. I have been playing this game for like a month or 2 and it f***ing sucks. Sure you can customize weapons and cars n' stuff but the online gameplay just sucks. I ready in and wait 30 minutes for a mission and my other teammates wont even do the mission, they kill me when I try doing something(friendly fire X_X) and tell me they're 'priming'(from what i heard is not doing â¥â¥â¥â¥ untill a police force comes to the scene) and yelled at me for being a noob. I as a rookie game developer tell the developers 'you're doing great with customization, but PLEASE set up a better matchmaking system'. for the players i say 'Just play GTA Online, this â¥â¥â¥â¥ just sucks'. oh and one more thing developers 'WHY THE HELL CAN I ONLY RENT GUNS'. thank you
8262	0	a	Spent half an hour in the character customization menu making sure I have the best looking jugs and nostrils in the game, entered a District, tried to do the tutorial, got gunned down by another player. Re-spawned. Tried to make sense of the map. Got gunned down. Re-spawned. Tried to do a tutorial, was prompted to press K. Pressed K, received a mission. Got called a noob and was told to go fornicate off and die. Got gunned down.  Uninstalled the game.
959	1	a	analogous to a drug
2504	1	a	this is one of the funnest copen and crim games i have ever played 
8858	1	a	For those of you looking for a fallout-ish experience, you wonât find it here For the very few people who actually read this review, Iâm going to start off with everything bad that it does. 1) The community feels as dead as all the enemies I had to kill to complete one objective 2) The game does nothing new, it is very generic and copy-paste of other games in the genre.  The purpose of a game like this is to do what similar games of its genre did and build on those ideas and make them better. Not fabricate what already exists and slap a âdoneâ sticker on the front. I want something new, with a quirk or unique feature, not a copy paste.  3) There is very little explanation about how skills, items and game mechanics work, only basic key mapping like moving, turning and combat. 4) The story is fairly mild at best 5) Melee combat is dull and unsatisfying 6) Quests have a tendency to âbug outâ or have confusing objectives, one situation was where I needed to go to a point on the map, let an NPC follow me and walk back to the start point. Apart from I failed the quest somehow on the first try, the game never explained how or why.  When I went back there the NPC that was meant to follow me no longer appears, and as such I have no idea how to complete the quest. Other situations like questing disappearing from my menu also happen frequently, meaning quests I was halfway through needed to be picked up again from a guy quite literally 3 miles away and completed in one go.  7) Menus are very clunky, from the start I was bombarded by a bunch of skills I didnât know (and still donât know) the effects or uses of. 8) The crafting system does nothing new, by which I mean it's all dull bashing objects togeather to make something out of thin air. It's also crafted in real time, which can sometimes be up to half an hour for some items. Maybe more. 9) How skills work is never explained, you have to figure it out via tooltips. 10) For me this game took over 50 minutes to download, unpack and patch before I could play. This was on a 100 mbp/s connection with no bottlenecks and commonly downloads big budget triple A games in under 30 mins. 11) I have no idea how they got the screenshots on the store page, I push everything to max and it still looks like something a commodore 64 would play. 12) Fallen Earth tries way to hard to be funny. Often forcing vulgar 12 year old humour at every turn.   So what is good about it?
3846	0	a	Matchmaking is absolutely god-awful. Expect to be matched with people several tiers below your level against max rank players. Half of all the rounds I've played have been unfairly skewed in the opponent's favor. Of course, I shouldn't be bashing new players for being bad- we all once were- but I do start to get a little annoyed when I'm being placed in a team with them on a very consistent basis.  In addition, this game is infested with cheaters/macroers. Ok, maybe I'm in no position to start 'hackusating' others- I have no proof whatsoever- but when people maintain *perfect* accuracy at long distances/whilst jumping, know where you are, whenever you are and come to kill you no matter how many walls there are between you and them, then maybe, just maybe, there's something to be suspicious about.   That's all I have to stay. Please, just stay away. This game needs to die.
8386	0	a	I do not recommend this game unless they remove all but cosmetic items from the cash shop.
5614	0	a	this game is not only pretty laggy also every vip guy who plays here they are impossible to beat them since they all have stronger weapons than non Vip people wich really makes me not even pay a cent to this game
8713	0	a	GTA but online. Super fun. Download it!  Edit:  I used to love this game, but it has been ruined by G1. The game is entirely pay to win, there's a huge amount of hackers, no communication from G1 about what's going on with the game, and when I just recently tried to play the game again, I couldn't even connect to the server. This game would have done well in the hands of capable developers and publishers, but unfortunately that's not the case.
8667	0	a	ye while youre at it, you might as well shoot your self in the knee
8954	1	a	brilliant game full of hours og adventuring
6059	0	a	I accidentally modded my gta v and this game poped up in my library, I don't know what happened but the graphics now looks garbage, controls feels like if my character is having a hangover, now hearing 10 years olds screaming in my ears and insisting that he screwed my mom last night. DO NOT MOD gta v! I repeat.
8002	0	a	doesnt even launch just takes you to a facebook page   EDIT: managed to get past the facebook page issue it launched closed itself out after about a minute then locked up my steam and i cant get rid of it i have no options but to restart my computer to be able to play any real games and delete this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ so in end if you want to break steam download this game and have fun breaking steam i sure as hell didnt
10649	1	a	Me and my friends thaught we would play this once for 2 minutes but this game is the â¥â¥â¥â¥
83	1	a	Still one of the best shooter MMOs on the net. What I personally keep in mind when thinking of APB is the most unfriendly community someone can imagine. If you have a good run, they call you a hacker, if you have a bad run, you're called a 'r3t4rd': Laugh or Leave! ;)
9820	0	a	This game absolutely SUCKS!
8993	0	a	This is the worst game i hav ever played... waste of bandwidth
1200	1	a	great game but has its down sides like hackers an being called a hacker XD i dont know the 1st thing into hacking but on the plus side of things its free basicly like gta online but it was out before gta online altho there are gold menbers that kick â¥â¥â¥â¥ but its a good game
8563	0	a	I download this game to find oh i try to login and nothing happens,i click play and is acts like its gonna play then the browser closes. THIS GAME IS A â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ OF A WASTE OF TIME!!!
990	1	a	  Nice game
2697	1	a	The best way i found to describe apb is that the game is a gta san andreas version,but with a huge range of customization to be done and a lot of fun.
1384	1	a	It was alright when I played, I don't know if it's been updated to be actually worth the time/money. But overall, I have to recommend to at least try it.
4229	0	a	This game worked once for me. ONCE. it was super laggy, i didnt know how to play the game and i got spawnkilled by a guy with a rocket launcher.    So whatever you do, dont waste your time on this stupid game. it could have been a good game but its just â¥â¥â¥â¥. evreything is â¥â¥â¥â¥.
7289	0	a	Wtf man??? i installed it and my antivirus found a trojan horse virus!!! Dont download this!
9388	1	a	If you like to play fallout this is the game like fallout but as in a MMO.
9947	1	a	the game is good i had a character who was one of the leaders of a notorious gang we rekt at pvp , i love the sniping action the game might look crap but the feeling is wow
1357	1	a	Just love the customizations for the outfits and cars other whis more games had this type of system
582	1	a	it says it requires very little but my pc has better then that and still has pretty bad frames but in gernerality It is very adicting and fun
8115	0	a	i was sooooooo excited to get this game! and i tried everything to make it work but it wont even come on! 
5565	0	a	Pay to win garbage, ignore my 150 hours on record. It's filled with hackers and rich kids.
4243	0	a	It is a poor man's GTA Online.
4502	0	a	This game is terrible even for new players it has hackers,pay2win guns,unbalance match making,horrible gameplay and alot of glitches that admins ignores
6156	0	a	Arcade-style twitch fighting with random explosions similar to the beginning of any Call of Duty match. Repetitive, boring, and infuriating.  It does have awesome customization for both vehicles and characters, but overall the gameplay is terrible and antiquated.  3/10
872	1	a	I spent an entire summer building a character and leveling him; all while enjoying myself and not spending any money, only to find that I have a lifetime/non negotiable ban on my account. So as a sane person I decided my time with APB was done. Fun game, except for that.
7772	0	a	I couldn't even play the freaken game because the stupid sky and screen of the game kept giltching and i couldn't even see. whatever you do save your memory and save your money. i would give it a 1 out of 10 if they could fix it. which might not even happen. DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2718	1	a	Awesome game like GTA but the lag is very annoying so I'm not playing APB anymore but it's an awesome game.
4466	0	a	Now that GTAV is out on PC this game and its â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ devs can finally die.
9581	1	a	worst game ever 10/10 would unistall again
8899	1	a	a decent game but as i have seen pointed out it lacks imagination in some of the enemies and the bosses just soak up bullets but overall its a decent game about like runescape but again not the same you will just have to check it out  things it has that make it worth the time  - player built vehicals - factions (player controlled and non) - pvp and pve  - decent respawn system that will make you work to get your stuff back but wont make it easy mode - interesting selection of weapons   thats the highlights feel free to try it out its a free game aside from some in game things but thats how the gaame keeps running so overall its a decent game but fun if you like FPS games
9763	0	a	it is â¥â¥â¥â¥
5586	0	a	HATE IT wont load and its glitching like crazy ]:
6128	0	a	Pay-2-Win laggy hackfest. Criminals are given an extremely large amount of bonuses and advantages over Enforcers, rendering Enforcer an almost unplayable faction in comparison. There are a number of guns that you can only purchase exclusively with cash that have a clear advantage over the free guns. Enforcers cannot get all vehicles, whereas Criminals can. Criminals are able to gain more money, faster, have backup privilege, have biased missions where they can run off with the deliverable items, longer mission times for them to siege objectives, shorter mission times for them to defend objectives.  The game is dead.
4043	0	a	Pros: + Insane amount of customizations + Nice looking cars + Decent combat Cons: - Repetitive - Insane grind - Need real money to really enjoy the customization system - Bad lag during peak hours
609	1	a	Steve is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥
10769	1	a	it's very fun to go out and adventure with people and raid dungeons and get better armor and weapons and improve your stats over a period of time

6327	0	a	this game â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sucks! its not a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing gta game! 
1411	1	a	Love it.
5709	0	a	Run around, shoot people, blow stuff up, it's all the same. APB Reloaded? What does 'Reloaded' have to do with this game? I'll tell you: nothing. APB Reloaded is a GTA clone whose only characteristic that sets it apart is the fact that it's free. Who doesn't want a free-to-play, third-person shooter where the goal is to ruin people's lives? The game itself is fine: I can tell the devolpers tried very hard, but APB has very little lastability. After a 20 minute game session, I'm tired of using cars to block the entrances to the main hubs of the map, I'm tired of crashing my cars into other players, in fact, I had more fun screwing around in this game than acually playing the missions. After a while, I had to create my own fun. Is that what you want in a game?   Because I know that I don't.  Nice try, but no cigar.
5986	0	a	im stuck in first mission.....
10692	0	a	I am a very old payer of this game, ever since WildShadow owned it and there was the old forums. This game used to be amazing, fun, interactive and enjoyable. You had to put time into the game to get anywhere, and even then you could lose it all in one death. Regardless of that, it hooked almost all players of this game who were willing to put 5+ hours a week. Personally, I was very addicted to this game during 2011 and 2012. Then, doomsday came: Kabam bought Realm of The Mad God. Everything was transformed into buying gold to achieve things. Back in the old days, you had to grind dungeons to get an incantation to just maybe get a tier 12 item in the wine cellar. Now, just buy realm gold and get tier 12 items in nexus. It's â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up. Unless you're rich as â¥â¥â¥â¥ and don't care about money, don't get this game.
7056	0	a	You will encounter pro players if you are new in game, those players have plenty of premium and P2W weapons you dont stand a chance and thats why this game is dying all new players, are rage quitting because of that, the devs dont care about it because all the Golds are paying in $ Gold/premium hackers are not getting banned, they get supported by game masters.  roughly 54% of the players are hackers, 30% are Pro players and clans and all the rest are randoms and noobs.   gold players play on silver servers to pwn the regular players, the silvers are mad and play on bronze servers because they are tired of getting owned by golds and the bronze players and trainee players are getting pwnd by both and thats why they are leaving this unfair game, you shoud NOT download this game until they fix it or you will have a very frustrating/painful and hard start into this game, which means you are forced to go this way because they will NEVER fix this issue.
1103	1	a	is good i met 2pac he wasnt very nice tho
10275	1	a	Like a Fallout New Vegas MMORPG, the creators of this game are genius! So much to do, so much to see and so many items to get, this game is one of the most addictive things ive ever played
9242	1	a	Multiplayer Fallout!
994	1	a	Can point a rocket launcher at my feet, shoot it, not die, and kill the idiot charging me from around the corner  It's an okay game  Lemon/6.2
6209	0	a	I have put many hours into this game, and it is extremely fun. However just like Blacklight: Retribution, very pay to win and lots of hackers. I still love this game, however you will probably not.
6374	0	a	Filled with brazilian â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and a poor quality engine poor support and lack of diversity dont bother with it
7105	0	a	How this game still has ''so many'' people playing it ?
3316	1	a	Amazing game when playing with friends!
3460	1	a	this game is the best game of 2015 and will be for the rest of my life because it is all in one missions open world 3 person and i just think you who dont like it just dont comment   thank you abp  
493	1	a	APB was good in the start, my best ever ping was 180, it went up to 500â1300 ping, saw one frame every few minutes, deleted 160 ranked account. Gave my friend 2 mill. Gave him 5 good vehicles. Oh, and a Nano. It is a very good game if your internet is good, although, it can get boring after u have basicly everything, which will take some time, if your internet is bad like mine.. Don't download it. But if u have a good internet and are bored most of the time, and have 1-3 friends to play APB with in your friendlist, it will be very fun. There are quite a few hackers + scammers. Beware.
3523	1	a	This is one of my best games i have ever played this is the best 3rd person game i have played Best game ever 10%10! :D
4085	0	a	Do not get fooled by my gameplay, the game is now P2W after G1 bought it P2W= Pay to win. if you like P2W games then this game is for you.
350	1	a	APB Reloaded is a great multiplayer game with lots of chaotic fun. Grab some friends and jump in if you like third-person shooters without a cover system and open worlds like GTA.
2834	1	a	Like GTA you can customize character,car and many more.you must try it!!
9548	0	a	this game is trash kys
7753	0	a	Good while it lasted
6790	0	a	its a great game but its frickin pay to win every team i go against im sniped by a gold weapon which has perfect stats so either nerf these weapons or make them rewards because im sick of it. DONT PLAY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU HAVE MONEY  
4098	0	a	gta 5's â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ younger brother
5656	0	a	Full of bugs and errors strait from the start
1889	1	a	best game its free and its for windows
3711	1	a	This game is actually pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥ing good.  It takes a lot of practice, consistent playing &amp; willingness to learn and adapt to its unique brand of combat but once you do, especially with a few friends, you can kick so much â¥â¥â¥â¥. There is nothing more satisfying than outplaying a team of hackers simply because you have better mapknowledge &amp; practiced skill with the unique weapon systems.  I think one of the biggest things that throws people off is the idea that guns only deal damage at certain ranges, too many times do I see an NTEC 5 user shooting an enemy at 80m+ and wondering why he doesn't get a kill.
9592	1	a	Does anyone know why I can't log in? I tried the GS acc and my steam acc and neither have worked. Yes i have validated my acc, and checked my password, and it still doesn't work. Im not giving this game a thumbs down yet, because i still have a bit of faith in it.
4462	0	a	This game is a clunky, pay to win, grand theft auto wannabe with floaty driving controls, and awful gunplay. Just because I don't invest money into your game doesn't mean I shouldnt have a CHANCE. The gun you start off with is so weak, I unloaded 3 full clips into a guy (Who might I add, was decked out in fancy micro-transaction clothing.) and he had hardly a drop of blood leave his body. Then he proceeded to pull out his micro-transaction LMG, soot me three times, and kill me. This game is terrible, you might think I'm being unfair, but I've put almost three hours into this game (which I know isn't the highest amount, but this game is so bad...) through three seperate occassions thinking I might have been a bit too harsh, but no, this is just plain bad.
213	1	a	I...love...this...game... â¥Forever my favzâ¥
3054	1	a	Loads of potential, ruined by hackers, overpowered pay-to-win weapons, and a lack of excitement. This could've been an amazing game if it weren't for repetetive, unbalanced missions and hackers. There's also not much else to do while free-roaming. There's great customization, though. But that's about all APB Reloaded has to offer.
10813	1	a	I absolutely adore this game. It's one of the only games you play for a week and die then stop playing for three months.
10479	1	a	Game is addictive, and community is excelent!
3569	1	a	PLS MAKE IT FOR MAC I LOVE DAT GAME
6857	0	a	i used to think this game was great, but i was extremely wrong  the community is terrible, if you lose or win you have a good chance to get either a generic 'gg' which isnt too bad, or you will get insulted. what makes this even worse is that there is no rule about being nice to other players at all  the matchmaking is even worse, any rank can visit any server even if the server is dedicated to a rank lower than them. this means that a silver rank can join a bronze rank server and absolutely destroy everyone  driving is sloppy because if you lag a lot you have a 100% chance to crash into a building and kill a few civillians  this is what really changed my mind the most, the criminal faction when i started playing as a criminal, i was followed by enforcers non-stop so they could witness and then kill me without giving me a chance to even blink  this game could be a lot better if the devs actually put a lot more thought into the game
10218	0	a	This game is dogshite. Graphics suck, lag out the â¥â¥â¥â¥, long install time, not at all what was advertized. Controls clunky and enemies are stupid. This is a barely held together string of flawed code.
10439	1	a	A very amazing game been playing the heck out of it past few days.Feels like fallout but with a way bigger customization for character gear and you get awsome vehicles and mounts just so amazing so many options. 8/10
9076	1	a	for all the apocalypse-shooting-multiplayerlovers out there...  this is the perfect game for you !!! ive been sourching a long time for this sorta games but for his categorie is he the number 1!!! espacialy cus its a really big open world with loads of tasks and stuff above all its free so download now before its to late :D
10772	1	a	i love this game
10554	1	a	its not pay to win, if youre good enough you dont need money (i have 3k hrs+ over afp)  spent 0$ on new acc acc is currently worth 200$+
5650	0	a	this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ bad, pay to win, hackers and cheaters run around as they please, cops dominate the criminals. what i mean by that is if u are in a crominal and 1 enforcer spots u while he's in a party of 4 there squad will stun u with u having no hope of getting your stash back. the fact a enfocer can stun someone and completely take them out of the fight for 30 seconds is rediculously 1 sided and crominals have no special tools of the sort. This basiclly tells al new pllayers to pay as enforcer and if you want to have fun catch a criminal in the act and get the jump on him before he even knows that he got caught so you can steal all of his stash. In reality the is enjoyabllle with my friends but the game coulld be alot better if playes that played longer didnt have such over powered guns making it that much harder for casual or new players. if they dont fix some of these balancing issues I don't see much of a future for this game
4633	0	a	I love the customization and everything. The only problem is, the community is more toxic than a nuclear meltdown site, the game is clawing at your wallet 24/7, and the fighting is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Honestly, I would play it from time to time, in between 10 hour sessions of TF2 or whatever, but...well...here's the thing. I once logged on to APB, wanting to just â¥â¥â¥â¥ around for an hour or whatever. I get the infinite loading screen glitch, and I haven't been able to play since. Yes, I've gotten free stuff for waiting...BUT I CAN'T ENJOY THE FREE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING STUFF WHEN I CAN'T GET INTO A DAMN SERVER! I found there is one way to bypass this, and it's by creating a new character from scratch. Every. â¥â¥â¥â¥ing. Time. I. Want. To. Play.   I really want to like this game, I really do. But I'm not gonna spent one â¥â¥â¥â¥ing cent until you fix this â¥â¥â¥â¥.
3065	1	a	Good Game but only downside is you need a good computer to get alright fps. Some Servers are very small and you get to know alot of people good but really bad mission pairing. I give a 7/10.
745	1	a	Honestly I didn't like this game at all, I don't know if I just joined a bad server or something, but it was just a major pain in the rear.  -I lagged constantly even with good internet and 30 or less ping -There were a lot of players that either spent money or farmed a lot that had MUCH better weapons than noobs making it unfair when they went and saught after the new guy while he/she is learning how to play. Out of the 100 minutes I spent on the game, I spent 60% of the time dead... -The graphics were not very good (mind you I played about a year or two ago... I do not know how much this game has changed since then...)  Other than that, the community seemed nice at the time, I just didn't find it fun.  6/10 I will recommend it, but probably wont play it again since it annoyed me so much XD.
4114	0	a	This Game Blows, the music sucks, you can't even rob an armoured armed Truck. Waste of my time this and I'm To Sexy For This Game :D
7553	0	a	just another P2W, being a criminal in real life it's cheaper than this laggy game full of aimboter players, so go on and use those $10000 that you're paying for this game and use them for a real gun.
1430	1	a	cool. nice shooter doensnt seems there's alot of hackers
10363	1	a	awesome game u should try it 
8069	0	a	This game is deader than the zombie apocalypse, the nuclear fallout, or whatever disaster that decreases human population density up to 50 square miles per person per server region.   If you played the game right now, you will get to be a part of a special few that have spent too much money to let the game go. Also some people just can't play the game without 'trainers'.  You want to play with the same person every night? That have been playing years before you? Has tricks that you don't have? I guess this game is for you.   As a person that has been a commune to the game before, my warning of this game being a 'Gold' drainer has not been heeded 5 years ago. Buy permanent to win or pay premium to be financially stable to even participate in the whole item customization and selling experience.  Yes you will have to rent guns that expire weekly if you have not bought any. Expire weekly.  If not bought. Up to 20k gold for a gun. When a maximum amount possible weekly earned is a little 5k. Not counting the the little Cops and Robbers sideshow that earns more money than the actual missions, nobody does that anymore.   The new guns that came out on the market is to say 'Sorry but we are too lazy to fix the weapon balance, here buy these new ones instead'. Those guns are not 'rentable'. 
3079	1	a	Nice game, i've been playing as a criminal
6979	0	a	I do not recommend this game 100%. It is 'Pay to Win' meaning you have to pay real money for the best gear or you will never win like you should be. And even when you do buy something, it gives you a 30 day time period then you have to buy it again. It is infested with hackers which really downgrades the quality of the gameplay, I would just wait for the game to come out on Console 'Xbox One &amp; PS4' which is scedualed to hit the consoles in August of this year but we are still waiting word from game devs.  In conclusion, I recommend this game about 45%  This is not how a MMO should be.
10893	1	a	Very good game, but can be a little frustrating due to the system of losing your items upon death.
432	1	a	Totally awesome mmo that looks and feels like grand theft auto!  There are two diffrent sides! Enforcers and criminals.. I have only tried criminals..  as a criminal you are able to mug people and do ram thefts ( Smash cars into shop windows and sell what is behind the glass! )  There are also missions where you have to be in a team to complete it! 
6710	0	a	This game is GREAT but ALOT of HACKERS
2999	1	a	Had tons of fun playing this with The Respectable Gentlemen Crew on Guardian Server. Lots of great times and laughs. 10/10 would play again.
1901	1	a	Criminals VS Enforcers the only thing missing is being able to rob banks with your buddies or put down criminals with them.
7962	0	a	Great concept for a game. Poor execution.
9523	0	a	the cancer the cancer oh the cancer i think it gave me cancer
10109	1	a	This game, despite its few bugs that dont 'bug'me very much at all (haha) is one of the best mmorpgfps's ive ever played.  Its emmersive its competetive you dont need to purchase things with reall money to have fun (just to show off) the character development is greatly in depth with the things that effect others the amount of things to learn is somewere in the millions theres something new to discover every day it can be played almost endlessly for years (ask the very first players that are STILL playing)  the list goes on.  I strongly recomend this game to anyone who likes open world, in depth, post apocalyptic, competitive, play forever mmorpgfps that is free to play.  Well done developers  P.S.- all you naggers out there who down the game for its tiny little bugs need to focus on the good things more, not the bad things.  Your's Truly, Tajaloe
1998	1	a	GTA online FTW !!!
1800	1	a	A much better game with huge customization. Recommended!
228	1	a	u â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s better play this cus its dope hell â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ weed watermelon whitewomen friedchicken!!!!!!!!!!!!!
9370	1	a	Well if your into those shity games like minecraft well it's better to play this game you can get ATVs and cars and go on missions I think it's the best game I've ever played
1363	1	a	Multipayer Grand Theft Auto, though not as epic as GTA its a cool copy.
279	1	a	I like this game For its Customisation ! and how you Are able To Roam in this game
1358	1	a	a fun game but they do have some balanceing issue(really bad issues) but i had a blast overall so i recommend this
6456	0	a	Other than the really good customization features. You are up for a sketchy game. By sketchy I mean, there is no anti-cheat system, nor is there a proper 'Report abuse' feature. They don't care who or what you think is hacking. They just do whatever to buff or debuff weapons and more. The guns and most of the other features are locked unless you have premium. It's one those F2P games where you have to buy Premium in order to get the most out of a game. Of course, most games do the same, but for this game, Premium statuses make the game unbalanced. (This is my opinion and expressing why I wouldn't recommened the game).
2293	1	a	Best game 11/10 Thanks g1 for good quality game. Only g1c i hate its fookin expensive .-.
7673	0	a	I'M FROM PLANET VEGETA
2072	1	a	Make no mistake, this is not GTA. It is it's own thing. And it's a big give and take. The big attraction is the customization for characters and cars. It's VERY involved, and I love it. The gun play is passable, not great, but it has it's moments. Driving is terrible, it feels just totally wrong. The game modes are a lot of fun, with one exception. You can only get so much fun out of this game without friends to play with.
781	1	a	got killed by a hacker       9/11 - would die again
6842	0	a	This game sucks
1112	1	a	one of the greates GTA online out There
9609	1	a	this game is a mixture of awesomeness, and boringness while you have fun on your adventure of killing things you cant really do much more than trade and buy stuff. But if ur into this kind of stuff then this is the game for you. But if you are the type of person like me and love challenges then i suggest to you starbound it is the most amazing game its better than minecraft and terraria put together with it only being in beta
8601	0	a	Right well played the game for a while and i must say it could be fun if you enjoy unfear match ups and almost impossiable leveling up. The game could use some help in combat CUZ the headshots do same amount of damage and taking cover is ussless most of the time , custermizing is a ******* pain and finaly making money if you dont do ingame purchase is slow and repetative. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!FOR ALL YOU LOOKING TO GET THE GAME DONT!!!!!!!!!
5459	0	a	Couldnt â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Launch the game cause of error      11/10 Ign
2609	1	a	how do i staert it 
7505	0	a	I ignored APB for a long time, but due to a lack of other games I tried it. Generally, it is a solid Multiplayer PVP Game and makes fun for a short period time, but it has too many negative aspects in my opinion.  Pro's:  -Kind of GTA online clone.  -You can play and level Cops and Criminals.  -The design option is very big and funny. You can spend hours creating Vehicles, Style etc.  -Nice Cities with good spots and nice surroundings.  Con's: -As always in such games there is a ton of aimbot users most on criminal side in my opinion, wich ruins balancing totally in many missions. -Missions get very boring after a couple of days, cause they are always the same. Its only 4-5 different mission types on each side. -Most of the random players are not cooperative and not playing in team. They dont use chat and running like chickens into the other teams. Very frustrating when you have highlevel players and premade teams against you.  -For such a little online game it has way too many lags, what makes combat sometimes too stressy.  -The loading time is way too long. It needs up to 5 min. to get into the game, and you can not do anything else at this time cause the launcher makes your saystem slow, otherwise the game crashes. Thats not a resource problem its the simple game client.  -BUT Worst thing is the Pay to win! faction. Get better guns and bonuses from the shop or get 50% more than all other players. WTF...Without premium this game is nearly not playable. For example with premium I did level 4 Factions in one day to max, without it I did not even get one of them two levels up and got so much less money, that I can't get any better weapons.   After a week of playing alone and with freinds, I can only say...In the end you have to do frustrating and boring Mission farming....the design option is funny and fight can be thrilling sometimes, but after a couple of missions even that doesnt make it better. And thats the point where I stop playing such games.  If you like playing games where free to play means 'Counter strike' with frustrating and boring farming 80% of the time, and if its not bother you that a game has so many aimbot players, try it, otherwise leave it be and do something better with your time.     
10779	1	a	I played this game a little bit. It's ok.
9386	0	a	When I made an account it never asked me to make a username. When I go to sign in it asks me for the username i never created??? What is my mythical username and how do I find out?

8964	1	a	I Honestly Enjoyed this Game , alittle thing w are all looking for , crafting , uniqueness in character customization, contruction , PVP , And a great storyline that satifies all of us RPG-pvp loving fanatics, i haven't played that long yet, but so far its very smooth and has really good graphics. no bugs of my knowledge , Props to the Devs on this one :D
1719	1	a	Action-packed, easy to learn (but hard to master), lots and lots of customization options (even without paying for anything). It's what an MMO shooter should be.
828	1	a	THIS IS THE BEST GAME ON THE PLANET. WHEN I'M NOT SURE MY 'F' KEY IS WORKING I ALWAYS LOAD UP MY FAVORITE TESTING PLATFORM, APB. WHEN LIFE IS GREAT AND I NEED TO BE BROUGHT DOWN A BIT I ENJOY A GAME FULL OF PAY TO WIN, EXPLOITING, AND BUILT-IN ANTI FUN MECHANICS THAT MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE THROWING YOUR MOUSE OUT THE WINDOW BY THE END OF THE NIGHT.  10/10.
8658	0	a	The lag you'll experience is going to be â¥â¥â¥â¥ing unreal. Besides, so many p2w weapons have been added which can only be received through mystery boxes, this game went from awesome to complete â¥â¥â¥â¥ing trash. Don't waste your time on it. Your skill doesn't count when everyone's teleporting due to the lag and p2w â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ spray the AMG Medusa all around you. Idk why g1 is so money hungry, little â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s
9833	0	a	Didn't care for the early game mechanics.  I feel other games can offer better packages of this theme.
3778	0	a	 Mission objective: Pick-up briefcase and hold it for as long as you can   Three other players and I jump into a car and race for the pick-up location. We are just one corner shy of the destination, when an RPG comes flying in out of nowhere and sends us all into oblivion. The camera pans to a female player that looks like she just finished filming a scene for â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s.  One team member and I spawn at a nearbly location and rush towards the briefcase, which is now being held by gentleman sporting a trendy mohawk, sprinting through the narrow back alleys. We hide behind a wall and wait for the enemy to come closer. Suddenly, my co-player gets annihilated by a sniper, hiding anywhere between two blocks and half a lightyear away. Knowing that I am about to get killed in any moment, I jump into the alley and start spraying the gentleman with bullets. By the time I'm halfway through my magazine, he had already dropped the valuable cargo and started firing towards me. Two deadly shots after that and my lifeless body drops to the ground.  At that point, I see that my two other team-mates arrived with a windowless van, that looked like it belonged to somebody who likes to attract children's attention with candy. The copilot was hanging out the window and before he even got the chance to showcase his rat-a-tat maker, he got eliminated by the same marksman that showed his hunting prowess just moments before I died. The driver managed to leap out of the van, but got mowed down by a machine gun faster than a teenage COD player insults your mother.  We respawned shortly after that and by then, the briefcase was already traveling down a highway. I managed to talk a lovely lady into lending me her beige SUV and my crew jumped inside. The race for pride, honor and briefcase holding privilege had begun. I ran all the red lights on the way, nothing could stop my determination. I even handbraked into a couple of corners and pulled some wild powerslides through them, in a way that would put Sebastien Ogier to shame, all in hopes to catch up with our opponents as quickly as possible. Two kilometers and three squashed pedestrians later, we are on the tail of a menacingly looking vehicle one could only describe as a weird mishap between a Hummer and a soccer-mom's minivan.  My passengers all stuck themselves through the windows and opened fire on the vehicle in front of us. Unfortunately, the passengers of the car in front of us also decided to do the same thing and bullets were now flying towards our car. I started swerving like a mad man, trying to recall moves from Ken Block's latest Gymkhana video, but two of my passengers had already died. I figured the car was already way beyond repair and that there was no way I could ever return it to its owner in this shape, so I decided to go for broke and attempted to ram the car, hoping that it would spin out. I didn't even manage to get near it, when a huge flame burst out of my engine compartment and just moments after that, the car exploded. My buddy and I were burnt to a crisp and we had to start all over again.  The two team-mates that died first had already managed to secure a van and were honking the horn, trying to get us to enter the van. I told the three of them to go ahead, while I went to switch firearms.  Just as I was leaving the police station, I saw a huge truck stopped at an intersection. Thinking that was probably my best chance at doing anything, I hopped in and slowly but surely pulled away. I was driving in the general direction of the briefcase and was picking up speed. Three blocks after that, I was approaching an intersection at a blistering speed and sheer luck had it that the Hummer minivan just came racing through that said intersection and slammed head on into my truck. The truck had no intention of stopping whatsoever and the incredible amount of inertia started shoving the awful looking vehicle towards a building. Nothing could stop the brute force of my truck smashing the car into the wall, crushing it like a car compactor on steroids. The vehicle exploded and a majestic fireball engulfed the remains of the opposing team.  People came from near and far, cheering as I jumped out of the truck and picked up the briefcase. My team arrived just in time, so I hopped into the van and we drove off, ever so slowly. One wouldn't think, but the van really seemed to struggle hauling the extra weight of the briefcase, even if it seemed to be so light when I was carrying it just moments ago. My team complimented me on my spectacular display of driving skills and before I could respond, the unthinkable happened.  An RPG struck the van. And you guessed it, it was Sasha Grey again. I managed to hold the briefcase for twenty whole seconds before it got abruptly taken away again. I watched Sasha walk up to the briefcase and, just before picking it up, whisper: 'â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ n00b fa*gots'.  Needless to say, we lost that match. I never played ABP after that and to this day, I still question my sexuality due to Sasha's deep words.

1182	1	a	This game is incredibly frustrating. But play it, because at the same time, It's one of the best F2P Shooters I've found.
6584	0	a	I have spent a hell of a lot of time in this game and sadly don't enjoy it anymore due to the low level of customer support and the continued deterioration of gameplay.  Constant lagging, rubber-banding and blatant rage hackers have further ruined what was already a fairly toxic community. The complete lack of GMs certainly donât help matters. Truly a shame considering the high level of customization and potential the game had. 
1260	1	a	This is a sandbox game close to GTA. Lots of this to do. Like kill a randomer. rob a car. Jump of a building. An endless variety of things to do. So click that install button. It might take a while to load but its worth it. And for those peeps who love making characters you can make a character. Choose from criminal and enforcer. Get better weapons and clothes and Rule your World!!!!!!
479	1	a	sorry about the scar.
2496	1	a	I thank that APB Reloaded is a good game for online gameplay. If you like Blowing up your friends cars, Killing peoples drug mules, and more of this trolly contint that you will LOVE this game! From making cars to giving you millions of guns, Most everything is 'Man Made.' (You can make it your way) Its always cool when you speed by a nub with a pink drug van!
7980	0	a	Copy of GTA, no very good.
8933	1	a	I don't care what anyone says, I love this game.
9477	1	a	God i love to shoot nuclear monsters with a paintball gun
665	1	a	This is my most played game, it is outstanding for a free to play game. With the size and variety of the virtual the city of San Paro, there is little repetition. It is the free GTA.
839	1	a	Ok, this is my first review, but I will try my best.   APB:Reloaded. I dare think that, after several hundreds of gameplay, i still enjoy this game. It has some good and some bad sides, like any other game. First of all, it has a HUGE customization capacity: you can customize nearly everything of your character and car. Unfortunately, its matchmaking system is the biggest flaw. I am a gold threat player, and I am forced to play in Silver threat districts, for the gold ones are almost empty. Some p2w weapons surely exist, but they can be defeated with teamplay (it is a must: a good team is the most important thing) or with some excellent f2p weapons, like Colby PMG. So, if you can find a good team you enjoy playing with, this is one of the best f2p games I enjoyed so far. Anyway you should have a badass computer, and a relly good connection: expect lag if not. A whole lot of it.  Be ready for sad moments, but also for a lot of fun if you want to play apb. I hope my grammar was correct. Now the servers should be back online, so see you in the game!
2371	1	a	it cools
2044	1	a	cops and robbers: the game 10/10
6882	0	a	I know the game is free. I know this. Does it mean I have to forgive it for being crap? No.  This game is exactly what I would expect from what is essentially a free-to-play Grand Theft Auto. Everything feels about ten years old, there is lag and general bugginess, and not a sh*t was given by anyone else as to whether the objectives were being carried out.  I didn't play a ton, but sometimes when you experience something, you are able to read it for the best that it could be independent of the momentary experience. This game doesn't have the capacity to entertain for the long term. Free-to-play games rarely do, though I feel I do have to mention Counter-Strike as one of a few exceptions to that rule. To be fair, though, this game is much newer than CS, and yet learns nothing from it or games like it.  This game seems more or less like a controlled environment from which get trolled other people than a legitimate attempt at entertaining; I knew that the first time that I attempted to kill the person with the briefcase, only to be shot from a vantage point directly above me that I had no hope of approaching from any other direction.  Take it for what you will - I played the game as long as I could stand to.

3803	0	a	I wrote this because APB is a good game, but has bad developers and when it dies someone should buy the rights and make things the right way!  Pros: GTA pvp style game, Free to play, unique song system, unique customization system  Cons: Pay to win, Full of hackers, Own company sells the hacks, Admins nonexistent. When they exist they abuse and steal accounts or kick people (they rage), Low player base (more chance that you will encounter a hacker), Server rank system based on bronze/silver/gold. You eventually reach silver rank and are pitted against all the gold players which are 90% hackers. Gamersfirst decided it was a good thing to remake the main menu which was an art masterpiece and turn it into an ingame rendered still image, increasing loading times a thousandfold on top of looking bad. New players wont know what this is. Also changed the original game theme as well, destroying even more the style the game had. Meaning it has nothing to do with the game. (street art techno chill punk turned now into mistery low bass song more fit to X Files)    Now onto the good stuff!! why are you hating so much?   This is an old story originally from this post (I was banned by an APB developer from that forum and post deleted, gladly all of it is in this review!)  http://steamcommunity.com/app/113400/discussions/0/276237094319491421      Links to images and videos of the proof below the story, enjoy.

6461	0	a	It's an addicting game, but lacks many things that would make it immensely enjoyable, headshots, visual range greater than 325 feet, heavy weapons doing more damage at closer ranges, destructible environments, melee abilities, FLAMETHROWERS, WHY DOESN'T IT HAVE FLAMETHROWERS??? Also, for such a large variety of weapons and gears, it seems to be very limited on options for vehicles, most upgraded vehicles are one of about a dozen set base cars with multiple modifications that do for the most part, NOTHING.

6880	0	a	0.01/10  This game is one of the worst 3rd person shooter ever made. The developers don't listen to the community and what the community wants in the game. The over-pricing of guns and clothes in the ARMAS market is rediculous (DON'T BUY ANYTHING WITH REAL MONEY). The server lag is insane and sometimes hard to deal with. Also, the amount of hackers you see is stupid and made me want to hack sometimes. The only good thing about this game is the customisation feature, but you have to pay for a premium to add more than like 10 decals to your car. This game is extremely pay to win, if you want anything good you have to pay with real money to get it.  Looking back now, I don't see any reason of how i could have played it for as long as I did.  I will never play it again.  
1037	1	a	I do this stuff in real life on the norm. Word to yo motha
10463	1	a	This game is awesome! You get to craft items... don't want to ruin the surprise of what though.You complete quests all while trying to figure out your past!   *Update* I have begun playing this game again. While G1 did destroy some great elements of the game. This is still one heck of a game. I'm not one of those people who played this game for the PvP, I was one of those people playing by myself for the story and mainly just because I stunk at PvP :p The population of the game has died off tremendously, but the people in-game are helpful and kind. It's still a game to consider for a couple of pointless, fun hours. Heck, at the very least, download it. It's free, nothing to lose.
7051	0	a	Probably favorite game of all time but since I have posted a dozen times on forums on Steam, Gamersfirst and APB website, and have gotten little to no help with figuring out a bug that wont launch the game. I am not recommending. Very salty.
3546	1	a	It takes a while to progress in the game and there is a large risk of skilled players (gold-rank wankstains) entering newbie-servers just to mess up your day. AND it's easier to buy the guns, cars and misc with real money than to play the game non-stop for days to get the new shotgun you've always seen those golden â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s wield and then only have it for like 3 days. The in-game currency takes a while to get alot of as well.  All in all, though, this is a creative person's DREAM game. You can customize cars, outfits, characters, themes and songs and utilize that ultimate strategic plan you've dreamed about for so long. If you ever wanted that intimate gaming experience with a small dev team and well-meaning regulars playing the game, this is it.  Even though the negative sides of the game may seem overwhelming, the devs and community are working hard to make new players feel welcomed in this game. I would seriously recommend this game if you have patience for it and if you are social person. Making friends with veteran players is a pro tip from a person with 493 hours plus in this game.  I hope this was useful for you if you've ever wanted to try a free GTA experience. DON'T let the mixed ratings of this game scare you away. Try it! If you've even considered playing this game for what it is, give it a try. It delivers ;-)
697	1	a	Yeah, That's A Rich Gang Game
3622	1	a	This game is so recommende if you wanna have â¥â¥â¥â¥ing fun 
3984	0	a	Until they fix all the issues, which are A LOT, don't play it... Just don't... Please.
281	1	a	This Game Is Awesome
6114	0	a	This game was a waste of time. The game is all based on money and how much money you wanna waste. He's a few 'bad' things about the game. I missed some. -Bad updates (The game was better a few years back)Â¨ -Time limited items -Money grinding only gives 30 day items -Expensive DLCs (You are not EA!) -Bad textures -Bad matchmaking system -Money â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ devs -Pay to win And i could do that in ages. The point is.. dont waste your time and life on this. There is many way better games out there. Alot of you might disagre with me at some points. But its a review. This is what i think! (I played this a few years back and now i begun to play it again and never knew it  became that bad!   UPDATE!: I played the game to see if i could find more reasons the game SUCKS heres some.  -Even more Pay2Win -Expensive gear -Invinsible objects and doors -Bad servers -â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Matchmaking -Only weapon and clothes updates -Expensive DLCs (They should be a fair price even if they weren't on sale)  Enjoy them..
5693	0	a	I'd like to start this reveiw by saying that this game has alot of positive things about it, but it's brought down by many other things, for starters, The possibilities for customization is nearly limitless, but unless you pay, you can only use three symbols.'Ok not a problem, I'll just use as many custom symbols as I can!' No. You can only use 25 symbols per custom symbol, unless you pay for premium, you're stuck with this handicap, and they will remind you of this every chance they get.  So you can't make nice clothes, cars, or tattoos, there's still more to the game like mugging, driving, and missions right? Wrong, the premium handicap applies here too, anytime you earn cash from crimes, missions, or arrests, you only get a peice of it, and they remind you how to get that in-game cash (here's a hint, it involves paying a monthly fee). It's not just money they take from you, gaining repution with contacts takes longer too, it's like they think less of you for not paying them to talk to you.  So you've had it, you give in and decide to pay to take off the handicap, which costs 999 G1C, and you can't buy exactly 999 or even 1000 G1C, you can buy 800 ($10) or you can buy 1200 ($15). Well now that you have you're credits, you spend the first 999 on premium, that leaves you with 201, why not spend it on the Armas market? Because the only perament item you can buy, with that much G1C is clothes. Did I forget to mention the weapons you buy in-game, no matter how much you spend will only last 10 days?  Well now you have premium, you can put some pretty cool stuff on you're clothes, or on your car, nope. You get one page of basic shapes to work with, you have to grind and hope for new ones, or buy another page's worth from the Armas market, which costs 199 credits, for one page, same goes for fonts, and emotes, of all things, you can pay 1999 to unlock the other emotes, 2000 credits costs $25. Pretty outrageous right?  Assuming this doesn't bother you because you sit on a pile of money, there's still problems with the game, like aimbotting, or matchmaking. Let's start with hacks, I once saw an admin, join the district, one of the first questions he was asked is, 'Are you going to do anyhting about hackers?' He responded with this 'While we don't much care for hacking in our game it is allowed'.Then there's the matchmaking, and player's skill is tracked with bronze, silver, and gold ranks, and 9 times out of 10, I would be put up against 1-2 golds, even when I played with other people, the other team was or almost was made entirely out of gold players.  Despite the problems with the game both listed an not, it can still be pretty fun, and it has potential to be even better, but for now it's held back by glitches, hacks, exploits, and greed.
8947	0	a	Ignore the community's existence and you're good to go :^)

746	1	a	Awesome to play with friends.
8934	1	a	An exelante game for any MMO fanatic. Game that will keep you busy for a very long time with allot of different people from around the world trying to carve their own little place out in the wasteland. Has a couple of bugs now and then but is fixed with a simple relog, and also has a very active update and bug fixing comunity that maintains it. Has a very comlicated HUD but you make it your own. Modular HUD.  After more than 1000 hours on this game, I must say it was nice. It does get very frustrating waiting for crafts to finish, and getting all of the materials but in the end its all worth it. A game that will keep you busy for a very very VERY long time and has so much to offer. Looking at the Single Player content such as NPC's that give missions and places to discover on your own, it has more than 1000 hours worth in it. I have not even covered 1/4 of it yet. PvP is somewhat a battle but you get the hang of it, make sure you got a good build for it though. This game is very modular in allot of ways, from HUD layout, to Charachter Build and Look. You are set free in the Wasteland. Group in a clan, gain a faction, make new friend from across the Planet (Seeing that its ONE Global Server) and Survive. So Carve out your own spot to call home in the Wasteland.  At 1199 Hours in this game I have finally reached the maximum ammount of money that you can have on a single character. 9y99r99b99w. This is through only crafting, trading and selling. Something I am very proud of looking back at now in the game.  As of the Steam 2016 Nominations: I know there are many Titles that can keep you glued to your seat saying that iconic yet oh so white lie, 'Just 5 more minutes' but of all of them I believe Fallen Earth has drawn me in the most. (As an Massive Multiplayer Online Game) Community, Crafting, Setting and just the aspect of exploring this massive world all connected as one server. It was a grind, but all of those grinding memories are oh so cherished. Thank you to the Developers of Icarus Studios, LLC.
1652	1	a	I have been playing this game ever since early 2011, and still to this day the events are epic and the updates are frequent. The game used to be owned by RealTime Worlds but then was bought by Gamersfirst, ever since then the games performance was dropped significantly. The servers are more unstable, they crash a half a dozen times weekly, and recently while I was online the servers completely froze for a good half a minute. The chat was flooding with complaints from players but it was pretty funny if you ask me. Hackers are uncommon on this game which is good.  A few of the reasons why I still continue to put up with this game is because of the player freedom and community. The character customization is very complex. For example, there are like 4 different customization sliders just for your characters nose. The clothing and character customization is so vast that I have seen players in-game dressed as Ronald Mc'Donald, The Joker, Harly Quinn, celebreties such as Justin Bieber, Tupac, Will Smith, Bill O'Reilly, Obama, Chuck Testa, Youtubers, and many more.  The vehicle customization is also huge and with certain vehicle modifications, such as Nitro 3, you can do stunts and jumps in a district and impress some people.   The game is very unique as far as the character customization and free roam aspect. I'd give it a 7.5/10 due to the servers preformance and the fact that many people get falsely banned quite frequently due to 3rd party programs when they never even did anything wrong. I'v lost friends that have just one day disapeared from this happening to them, it's depressing that the G1 staff don't help at all when it comes to unbanning. If you get banned on this game permanently for any reason at all, don't expect on getting it unbanned.
9343	1	a	This game has come a long way since its first inception, and even more since going F2P. Totally worth it if you enjoy traveling the wasteland.
2698	1	a	APB Reloaded isn't necissarily something you would want to play extensively. Much of the maps are drab and boring, customization is enough of a hassle to where you have to farm and play to start looking like you want, and alot of the mechanics that this game tries to work with fall short and make the experience lackluster in the long run. While it's not something I would call a favorite, I have moments in the game I remember fondly, so it's good enough to try at least for a bit. I would reccomend that you pay for at least a month to get a taste of the full game and see if you're happy with the result. I'd give APB: Reloaded and unofficial 7.2/10.
1136	1	a	Yes its a great game. If u dont have enought $ for gta 5 get this. Nt the same game that much but very similar!
9703	0	a	can't even login.
7581	0	a	i dont know it sucks i played this game for 10weeks before it came in steam and then a few hours from steam... they banned me for no reason they said that i had 'hacking' programs in my pc so id suggest pepole do not play it cause the same might happen to you
8138	0	a	APB Reloaded is, in my experience, a good and fun concept gone wrong. Server lag hits often, meaning that only people who pay for top-notch internet can keep going without any interruptions. The matchmaking system is undeniably the worst I have ever seen. 10 minutes in and I get thrown into a match with people who have nothing but machine guns that can blow up my car in less time than I can react, and even if I'm outside of a car, that thing can still rip me a new one while I still have my stock assault rifle. I've heard about cheaters and hackers, but I don't recall ever encountering one, though it's hard to tell when many weapons are essentially 2-4 shot kills. The weapons are good and do their job right. The assault rifles are neither good nor bad at anything in particular, the shotguns are guarunteed kills at close range, snipers are excellent at long range. But the machine guns, those things are over powered. As stated before, the machine guns can destroy vehicles in about 2 or 3 seconds of sustained fire. Most people cruise around in their stock cop/criminal cars which can't withstand too much fire and end up dead. They also have insane range and accuracy. The only weakness I've heard about them is that they suffer an absolutely terrible drop in accuracy when moving, but it doesn't seem to be as bad as it claims since I've been bum rushed by several people who just spray-n-pray. The only thing good about the game is the game modes and progression system, but with the problems I mentioned before one would have to take this with a mountain of salt. Like I said at the begginning of my review, it's a good concept that suffers from bad design and maintenance.
9509	0	a	Go to de_Nuke and start apocalipse instead of this.
6243	0	a	ok .  It look's nice in the pictures . But don't even try it . It dosen't even want to â¥â¥â¥â¥ing load . I mean rly .  It takes ages for the damn screen to pop up . and when it dose 'not responding'
753	1	a	I play this game to drive around in a car and listen to my music. Which I can not do in the real world.
1619	1	a	Arrested someone for holding a TV. 10/10
1185	1	a	its a game....
10265	1	a	This game is a very fun game its kinda like the games fall out and its even FPS or TPS and trust me u will have a blast. 
3195	1	a	Its pretty good once you know how to get costum stuff very unique engines of creating stuff, You get very confused for a bit at the start but it gets really good! kinda reminds me about GTA
367	1	a	I have played APB:Reloaded for 4 years total with 2920 hours in game (i dont use steam a whole ton hence ~1k hours.) Great game, great customization. Completely free to play, there is 0 PTW at all. Premium only gives benefits to customization, and aftermatch bonuses. Everything on ARMAS is reskins, early progression, weapon skins, and clothing and vehicle kits. Weapons are well balanced within their niches. Its a little difficult to get a handle on when starting, but find some friends, join a clan, and it becomes a lot better! It has significantly gotten better with the implementation of FairFight (Don't believe most of the claims in chat that someone is 'cheating', most times they actually aren't), and seems that it will only get better.  I recommend this game to players who wish to challenge themselves, can easily learn from their mistakes, and learn from their enemies. As well as players who enjoy customizing their characters, as it has some of the best customization options I have seen in a game so far.  Game also uses a bit of Ram 8gb will do just fine, anything less will probably get frustrating.  See you in San Paro!
8442	0	a	I have taken â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ better than this.
3019	1	a	If you can stick with the HUGE learning curve this game has, this is a real gem. The biggest problem with the game is the community. Find some nice friends in game, or a clan, talk to NOONE else, even turn off district chat. The shooting is fun, the missions are fun, the driving is fun. The game progression is OK, but slow, unless you have Premium.  I suggest if you like the game to get Premium, it's much more enjoyable ( for me at least ) to see progression happening at least daily, or semi-daily.  This game has VERY few aspects of P2W IF any ( arguable ), so as a F2P player, you can really keep up as well, but it's just slower to progress with contacts.  Again, if you can take the learning curve, and the community, it's a fun game. 
1178	1	a	This game is not that bad. i do like it but they got some big time bugs!
2222	1	a	Greatest game ever, worst comunity ever. MONEY . The biggest problem . It will destroy this game, everybody is so focused to get money from customers and give them â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥iest service ever. I dont know if that is trend in 21th century. But every fuc*ing single game that has been created around 2007-now is so damn focused to get money from players so much that i am sick of that, the corruption is spreading all over the developing studios. Everybody want to get fuc*ing rich, but they forgot about happines... So yeah , fuc* you all developers, delete my review if you want, but the message would be here, spreading and corrupting your tricky bussines. Game creators should not be rich. Remember that. Its a work, not a fuc*ing slavery for us, the players. Dont make us suffer for your obsession with money. We want to play and relax, you should not pay for relax. I have an idea for you, you see those banners ingame ? What if you insert in those som Ads from internet and make money from that ? Would not be that smarter ?
6166	0	a	The uninstall button works Thats the only thing thats works  
6641	0	a	the perfect game for someone who has days of free time just to get enough money to buy a small amount of things  4.5/10000000
3093	1	a	Good game to play at random moments. Like gta 5 but in a simply version
2393	1	a	I am so addicted to this game. If I could afford to, I would skip work to play this all night tonight and all day tomorrow. Simply amazing!
979	1	a	I would recommend this game because it is not Pay2Win. This game actually requires very much skills and knowledge ;) When you have played like 40 hours you should know enought to be good at this game. The ingame community is suprisingly funny but sometimes rude. It is my favorite game because I never laughed my â¥â¥â¥ off that much with my friends ;) 
802	1	a	Fun when not having to deal with server/lag issues
2503	1	a	get apb because u can mug black people
3451	1	a	great game
517	1	a	Now that I have mashed 1.4k hours into this game, a review is probably necessary.   I would say this game is very fun, I started off as a crappy silver player and carried myself up to gold. The opponents may be hard but it's very fun and challenging.   Honestly, this is just a free to play version of GTA series where there are stupid bugs and glitches still in game. To be perfectly honest the game is great, if you were to spend about 60USD you will be able to play the game without having to buy guns every 10 days; basically a Pay to Win game.   Keep in mind that this is a Third Person Shooter game and although it has an anti-ban programme it really doesn't do â¥â¥â¥â¥.  Also if you think people hack in this game, it just shows that you're very bad at APB :)  Note that this game is much more fun to play with your friends, as it has tactical values and teamwork necesseties in this god forsaken game.  Also Han is dead :)  Have fun

1213	1	a	A really good game with lots of customisation options, really fun to play with friends, it gets patched alot and the devs fix alot of bugs. The only 'big' problem of this game is the server lag that can sometimes annoy you and make you rage quit, but all in all its a really fun game :)
5867	0	a	This game isnt bad but there are alot of hackers and not very fun when the game is free to play but its pay to win

6962	0	a	This is the absolute WORST FPS I've ever played.... you're reading the introductory text (ie., you don't even know the movement keys yet) and get slaughtered in the spawn area by some APB Troll.... then he thinks he's so funny that he does it another 20 times.  If I paid for this game, I'd be â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. As it is, I'll simply uninstall it and go back to Combat Arms.
1726	1	a	Really fun, more friends you play with the more fun this game can be.
1212	1	a	If you dont like the game because of hackers, become a hacker.
1587	1	a	This game will make you love Vanilla Cookies. Don't ask questions...
10686	1	a	A very hectic game where there is always something going on. If you dont like restarting often, I would not recommend this to you. If you like free, pretty fun, but sometime frustrating games, then I would recommend this to you.

4942	0	a	Its a good game but its a pay2win game :/
9873	1	a	Very similar to Planet Calypso without the real money economy, space travel and a more Fallout 3 setting. However for a Free to Play game it's great and if I didn't already play Planet Calypso I would be playing this!
5651	0	a	This game used to be a ton of fun. I would like to say that I wasn't that bad at it, and enjoyed a lot of it. That was a while ago...  The Pay 2 Win aspect seemed to be heavily promoted as new, better, faster, and stronger weapons were released for those who could afford them. I never bothered paying real money on this game. The only two weapons I actually bought and tried, were a sniper rifle and an submachine gun. Now, these guns were decent, but very overpriced as I could only use them for a short amount of time. Besides, why pay for a gun when I can do just as well with the default? Either way I was helpless if I was playing against someone who had premium..  The customization in this game is unmatched. You could sit in the outfitter or garage for hours tweaking and playing with designs and customizing. The things you could unlock from the missions is the only reason I actually did them most of the time. The increasing amount of lag made driving, combat, and missions a hell for me as well as my friends.   Recently, the only fun I had actually gotten out of this game is when my friend and I would â¥â¥â¥â¥ around with others, not taking the game seriously. Actually playing the game was frustrating and sad..
3354	1	a	i wanted to play this but it was rather glitchy and laggy and i couldnt auctually play it at all and i am sad about that. 
5066	0	a	I CANT EVEN play please help me it keeps on telling me to restart the game or redownload it? i really would like to know how to play it wont let me even start it.

4761	0	a	Tutorial is useless, you enter a 'beginner' zone clearly overmatched against all others you are against for the missions. Driving physics are horrid and the shooting is a whole other story of crap. Would not recommend to anyone, waste of time.

6228	0	a	This game is so terribel. i have played for alot of years, on my other account wich is some times ago, and i tried it again on this account. And it was impossibel to play.  The game is so unbalanced its insane, if you are new you will get rekt to pieces and you will never have a good experience with this game. This game is so badly optimized that you will have to have the best pc in the world playing this game good. I have an okay good pc but i still get FPS shatters.   Costumazation is kinda good, the prahics isnt that good so it will not really look good. Alot of pieces of clothing you have to pay for, unless you just want a kinda boring persona.   Cars in this game is so â¥â¥â¥â¥ed, alot of times they will glitch out. and havning lag and driving is like dont drink and drive, and there is alot of p2w cars you can buy.  Weapons are â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥, use 20 bucks and you can get a account permanent gun, that you can use from level one. Even tho alot of the P2W ewapons are just looks of other guns, its still a waste of time using money on them. And not minding the joker boxes wich are boxes you can 'unbox' and get weapons/cars   At last. I WILL NOT RECOMEND THIS GAME!!!. Play this if you want to use 1000 hours learning to not mind, bugs and other stupid flawes that are in this game...... Sad to see such a good potential game, getting wasted multiple times over and over again. I would go som far to say if EA realeased this game, it would be better........  
946	1	a	A Fun remake of GTA For the PC For Free â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥IT!!
6264	0	a	When you uninstall just right!
9472	0	a	Honestly I Probably might like this game if it wasn't for  A)The 3rd Party EULA/Login  and B) the fact i couldn't login even though i had signed up  Hopefully this will be fixed.
1642	1	a	I love this game! rank 200+ . Amazing video btw ;) like the music. Totaly good game.. Maybe get better Physics?? because sometimes my cars flyin of just touching stuff :P
7293	0	a	I honestly can't recommend this to any new players out (me being one) just due to the fact of how behind you'll be. Now i only played a few hours of this and i will say that this has its goods and its bads.  The goods of APB is the detail it puts into your character, it's amazing; it even beats GTA5's customization with making your own cars, tattoos, decals, guns, and your characters body. The idea is also really good with cops and robbers kinda like a game me and my friends made in GTA4. If you feel like being a punk, pick the criminal; feel like justice, pick the vigilante both sides can just be a sheer blast.  Now the bads and the most obvious one (as you would expect from a free game) is microtransactions.Holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game has as many microtransactions as a mobile game and this really kills the customization dramatically. Now i know that you can't get everything for free, but some of that â¥â¥â¥â¥ is like 5000$, which turns fun gameplay into a grind. It is incredible how much guns cost and the cheapest form of getting the better guns is to rent them for 10 days.....fun; not to forget that the tooltip at the bottom of the loading screen only tells me to buy more stuffz. Up next is the fr, i can run almost all my games at high quality and keep a steady fr, but this game manages to go from a steady fr to complete freeze and then back to normal i don't know if thats cause of my internet or not, but its really annoying. ( also i have the settings on max and alot of the textures are blurry). The last thing is the servers you can get into one pretty easily, but my god people are just bouncing around and freezeing up or 'rubber banding' I think is what it's called.  All and all this game had alot of potential as an awsome game. If this didn't have microtransactions and was a pay up front game it would be great, but the microtransactions, grinding, servers, and fr all ruin it for me just keep an eye out and maybe these guys will make a stand alone title. P.S Punk Buster......really....sigh...

5763	0	a	Have you always wanted to play in bland, dead worlds? Have you always wanted to play a lame GTA ripoff? Do you want to waste space on your computer hard drive?  If all of those answers are no, don't get this. GTA is worth the money.
9208	1	a	Great game. + Great skill system, gameplay. And battle actions. + Graphics are fine. Suit better for older computers.   - Not so many players online.  ++ If you want to try a good mmorpg. This is 1

549	1	a	Seems to demand way more from your computer than it should (though I admittedly know little about MMO game design) and it LOVES to stutter at the worst possible times for me.   It also feels very 'pay to win' at times, though that's usually only a major factor if the opposing team is stacked with premium items. One on one, A skilled player with vanilla items usually still trumps an unskilled player with premium items  That said, if your computer can handle it smoothly, it can be a blast to play with a group of coordinated friends. Steam only let's me thumb up or thumb down, so I recommend it with an 'if' attached
5442	0	a	We seriously need to delete this one from our memory.
1813	1	a	Free to play. Guns. Need I say more?
10254	1	a	I RECOMEND THIS GAME HIghly as soon as i played it i fell in love ;) 
7781	0	a	Well I cant even play the game because when i click play the launcher appears then disappears, but it looks like a fun game i waited a year for this game to get better but it still does not work but after a while i will try again but for right now i don't think so
9086	1	a	This game has been out for a while, and, compared to other currently active MMOs, Fallen Earth does fairly well.  If you like the post-apocalpytic theme, crafting a variety of items, shooter action-rpgs, and playing with others, you should enjoy this one.  The aesthetics are pretty good, the equip-able armor and weapons are all visible on your character. The music and sounds are decent.   The controls are easy to familiarize yourself and, like most MMOs, the beginning tutorial is extremely helpful in establishing your bearings in the game world. The learning curve is moderate to challenging, depending on how familiar you are with MMORPGs and their mechanics.  Crafting is a very fun part of this game if you are into that - you can craft almost anything you see in the game world (which beats having to spend your resources on merchants. Within the first 2 hours I already was driving around in my own ATV. The gameplay is pretty good, however, it still remains fairly buggy in many areas. The AI has godlike sensors, able to detect and chase you across the map once you have aggro'd (hostile interaction) them.   Grinding in this game is actually pretty fun considering that the rewards are very reasonable and the variety in missions is very, very good - they aren't 90% fetch or find quests typical of many MMORPGs. Combat can be weird and clunky at times, and hopefully this will be improved, however, it has been a long time and these problems still remain.  If you can look past these bugs, and enjoy grinding and crafting in the post-apocalyptic setting, then give this game a try.   Recommend.
8684	0	a	No.i refuse to waste my time talking about this game.now go away and pirate a copy of another open-world game
3442	1	a	Love it man just need a good net and a pc but i love this game since gta 5 hasnt released for pc its like a replacement :D
5864	0	a	At the beginning it is fun but after a few hours you start to meet alot of people who have payed for better items and are beating you only because they have better stuff.

6666	0	a	need alot of revison and alot of balnce 
2892	1	a	This game is incredible! Comparing it with GTA online, it's a peice of poop. Why?  Charactor creation! You wanna have your character musclar, well OK! You wanna customize your hair style! No problemo. There's so much options for your character! Change cloths, customizing cloths,...etc  Vehicle customizing! Put at least 25+ decals for your car! Even a starter car can be majestic if you know how to! You can also DESIGNER your decals and vinyls with the designer!   Awesome weapons! You can mod the weapon too!   Good friend systems!   There's also some bad things: The match making system. Sometimes you are a newcomer and then you have to face P2Ws. There is a small amount of hackers.  You don't get to change and buy cars right in a mission district. You have to go to the social district in order to do that. I know there are some poopy PCs and it takes 10 minutes to go from a district to another.   The vehicles have too big limits. There aren't boats, helis and jets and tanks. I want it to be in there.  We all want to set our own bounties. I don't like how I have to get killz until I get to notoriety 5 (and that's nearly impossible xD). I want to be able to set my own bounties and the amount of money you get out of a bounty is too small. We definitly want to set 20k bounties.  SUMMARY  Pros: Awesome customizing systems Weapon modding Friend system!  Cons Too much P2W. The worst match making system. Limited vehicles Non-setable bounties.  -----&gt; Game score: 7.1 GOOD
1887	1	a	There has to be 10,000+ more things to do. I started a long time ago and still havent finished, Customize Vehicles and yourself, You can pick 1 side, theres 2, Thug or Police Choose your fate, grab your gun.
4746	0	a	It's a p2w. If someone has spent some money in this game, and he is in the enemy team,you are so dead. I don't like how when I started to play,Proffesional players was killing me nonstop in missions. I spent total of 910+ hours.        FFS Make this game play to win not pay 2 win. .I.
6863	0	a	The game seemed pretty decent right off the bat. Then I played a little longer and realized, it is a rushed piece of crap that should have never been released. It has potential however thats like saying Michael Jordan had potential at baseball BS he sucked at baseball. The game could have been something much better. All I am saying is that if it hadn't been rushed and it had a little bit more put into it, is that it would be a great GTA alternative or at least that's what I think             Sincerely, AnTixRushed
748	1	a	It's an ok game but it's free. Startup takes forever but besides that it's a good game.
9104	0	a	This game fricken sucks this game makes me mad, it represtents fault and a whole lotta lagg, Im sorry but its true I did not like fallen earth.  (sing)
8671	0	a	This game has potential, but GamersFirst (lol) is clearly incapable of giving it the attention it needs to reach that potential. The game is mostly fun, but to have that fun, you have to be prepared to deal with lag/microstutters, hitreg, botters, hackers, crap server performance, exploiters, pornography (player made images), racism, sexism, threats of real world violence, and a near complete lack of GamersFirst presence on the servers. I say near-complete, because there are occasions when the staff makes an appearance, but those are extremely rare occurances.   I would love to recommend this game, but i simply cannot. I have logged almost 300 hours into this game, and i've watched it mostly degrade in that time.  Best i can tell anyone is, STAY AWAY from this game until GamersFirst (can't even say that with a straight face) either gets the game under control, or sells it to a company that will.
7586	0	a	Fun game, terrible support, filled with trolls and hackers. The cars and robber / cop faction was fun. Go buy GTA and skip this one.
510	1	a	I was bored and my brother told me to play this game and I was shock and it was fun and i'm new anyway so I think I will have alot fun on this ABP Reloaded. +1 for you owner/coowner/staff member thank you for making this game
10329	1	a	I've had so much fun running around, picking up bits of plastic :)
10665	1	a	Should be called 'Realm of the Rage Quitters'
4536	0	a	Tried to play it but it wasn't the open world free to play game I expected, The maps were tiny and there were set things to do on each map which I didn't like, also it kept telling me to kill people with bounties but never told me where they were. All I really did was die and then got bored.
2585	1	a	Pretty fun game, especially now for being free. Lots of customizing your character, even if you don't have premium membership. Lots and lots of mission variety, from kill the vip, to defend and take and hold. Plus even as a cop you can highjack people's cars. Decent variety of weapons, and the mission districts are pretty big. Overal a pretty fun game
10310	1	a	great game

7941	0	a	it allways says app is all ready runing HELP
4134	0	a	Awesome game for customization , you can design the craziest thing you ever imagined! But awful for pvp matchmaking in my opinion. Not to talk about the cheaters of course.
7042	0	a	THE GAME SUCK YOU CANT LOGIN IN AND STEAM
10579	1	a	I played this in public once and everyone around me made fun of me.
10334	1	a	I thought the game has some real charm to it. Despite the high level of people who comment, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ing about how hard the game can is (if you can't follow basic instructions then you should be playing on a console, not a PC).
9892	1	a	Most people overlook Fallen Earth because its a F2P game, but you'd be suprised what it has to offer. Multiple maps that are extensive in size, the ability to craft over 90% of the items used in-game and the massive amounts of players that join everyday. This is a game I would recomend to any fan of MMORPGs, Post-Apocalyptic games or those who enjoy team combat.
10767	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ kabam used to be good but hey p2w is fine too
2090	1	a	GTA Quality!
2749	1	a	Good and fun game just one problem, too many overpowered weapons and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s, take that out and the game is great.

7273	0	a	I spawned in awaiting a brief tutorial describeing the mechanics and functions of the game and just basic need to know information. what I got was a room with two other playes and a quest log. I steeped out side to take a look at the world and was imedeately hit by what I assume was a rocket laucher. After I respawned I went to take another look and was imeadeately rundown by a player in a car. After all this I still understand whats going on........what is life?
526	1	a	so i downloaded this game for the first time ever and it just crashes on start up
7572	0	a	I really wanted to like this game. I really did. The customization is amazing, more games need to have this type of personalization. And that's the only good thing about it. The game itself barely works, controls are awful, the community is horrible (you get called a n00b by others when you ask politely for help and their best advice is to 'git gud â¥â¥â¥ lel'), glitches everywhere. I'm going to quote another reviewer because everyone else has pretty much summed it up: 'Complete garbage and full of hackers of all kinds.'
4973	0	a	this game is frustrating because for some reason i cannot close it
7344	0	a	tbh this game is trash but if you like a toxic community just go on any of the apb servers. It would be a great game but in the past 4 years only 2 things in this game have changed for the better. And even with those changes this game is not worth a download. If you play apb quit and if you dont then dont even download it.
3933	0	a	Remember when K2 Network wasn't a bad company? Me neither.  0/10  Bad netcode, pay2win and boring.
6689	0	a	This game is just bad. First time I tried it, filled with adds promoting there FaceBook page so on. This game is full of rubbish like this. I wouldn't recommend, even if it is a F2P
7545	0	a	a nice game, really indepth char customization. sadly it gets boring really quick. as it is just -&gt;get money-&gt;launder-&gt;buy some of the limited items of ingame currency -&gt; do again  you also get spammed in the face every 10 minutes with BUY PREMIUM GET THIS AND THAT  Physics are also just complete â¥â¥â¥â¥. also is car steering  but with some friends on skype you can defenitely have some fun in here.
9659	0	a	when i download i got a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing virus!
4753	0	a	Boring and clunky. Games looks average.
7678	0	a	It's a pretty good game, but it's the BIGGEST PAY TO WIN I HAVE EVER PLAYED. For example, it takes a while to unlock the rocket launcher. I've played this game for days and haven't come close to getting the gun that can one-shot cars. People can go straight in with real money, buy a rocket launcher, then run around blowing people up when they are such a low level. It doesn't seem fair that the people playing the game like it should be played are getting crapped on by the people who run in with a wod of cash and buy everything in the game.
1894	1	a	greatest free to play forerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
8409	0	a	Oh this game had potential...  After several times of trying to play this, I've come to the conclusion that this game, along with the devs, are just â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. The game is a joke of what it USED TO BE, and even then it was a joke of what it could be! Yeah you can customize, if you could actually play it and win missions. Yeah it looks good, but that's because it was filmed with godmode turned on and an aimbot used. The controls: Pathetic. To drive, your either accelerating, or idling. Turning a car is like trying to ride a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ without paying her. If you want some piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ to play, come play this! If you want a game that is cops v robbers, go play GTA, if you want customization, go play Sims or SPORE, but please for the love of the gods, leave this game where it is: In digital hell.
10228	1	a	great game to play for hour or sokill stuff get horsess and atvs it's prety sweet
4521	0	a	This game have pay to win problems seriously this entire game is pay to win. I love the idea and customization to any vehicle but pay to win meaning pay to do this that anything you want permeantly pay to win. I will say pay to win alot due to the fact this game is mostly pay to win. Free players who didn't want to spend money weapons expire 10 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing days about permeantly feature for us free players. This is very â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t you gotta spend money on customization the game focuses on customization and weapons so limiting free players is like limiting the freedom from the united states. That is why this game gets a 3/10 its too pay to win. So if you like games like this play it but I don't recommend it to people who don't want to pay any money on video games like me. Expect CSGO get that knife and sell it. The game needs more work into the free aspect not the players who pay.
4161	0	a	The gameplay isn't bad... if it wasn't for the fact that this is a micotransaction filled game. All the guns have that 'buy it and own it for 9 days' kind of thing, which is annoying as hell.   I also can never seem to find other players to actually play matches with. Are people just not playing this or is the system just broken?   Has potential but just kinda sucks.
403	1	a	PLEASE HELP ME MY GAME SHOWS THE SPLASH SCREEN THEN IT GOS AWAY AND DOESNT RUN!PLEASE HELP ME!

DO NOT DOWNLOAD
7369	0	a	play gta v its way better
837	1	a	This game is real example of hard work, this game has perfect engine and MMO world so I must say that this game is really good, gameplay is awesome, driving is less hard but don't matter. Anyway, this game is #1 from MMO games with 3rd Person View, no more words. AWESOME GAME! :)
9753	0	a	There are lots of hackers in every pvp area.  Don't try to speak to GM about it. They won't listen.  Maybe playable PvE-Only but gets repetitive and unrewarding very soon.  Abandon it and wait for a private-server.
244	1	a	Been playing this for a long time and still I can't get bored. Better than GTA and right under Saints Row The Third. I love the overall story, customization, adding music and the deathmatch servers.
3170	1	a	/spoiler This game was ok...hard to launch
5887	0	a	EVERY FRIKIN TIME I TRY TO PLAY THIS GAME I JOIN A SERVER AND I LEAVE IN 1 MINUTE AND A PUNKBUSTER ERROR COMES UP. F**K PUNKBUSTER
2669	1	a	I wish it was a Mac Os game also.
4766	0	a	It wont let me go past the updating even when its finished it &gt;:O
4843	0	a	The system requirements are insane, and even on a decent system it will lag and sometimes crash.   Also the last time I played (2012) it really was pay to win. Any decent weapon you would only unlock for a couple days before it re-lock itself, and you wouldn't make enough money to keep up with it. Then you'd go on some mission and a guy who spent a bunch of money would just 1 shot you with a rocket launcher while you had your starting pistol and nothing else. I hope they improved this since then, but it left a really bad taste in my mouth.  Overall it has a lot of potential and the world is chaotic and fun, but the points above make me not want to go back.
6783	0	a	This game was a HUGE waste of my time. I couldn't even play because the servers kept kicking me out. Any time I DID get into a game, I was disconnected in 30 seconds.
1620	1	a	Well, When I Play this Game, its fun As Hell. Its Free to Play, so Dont even look at those â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ reviews 
2026	1	a	i love this game
1704	1	a	Noting special but good.
9987	0	a	This is the worst MMORPG I have ever played in my entire life. This game is so bad that when I played the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing floor and wall textures didn't load, ON THE TUTORIAL. This game laughs at players with TERRIBLE graphics, HORRIBLE AI, and render distance that makes Atari look like Half Life 2 in HD. The only thing good about this turd of a game is that you can uninstall it. I would rather chop off my testicles and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, than play this game again.  -100/10
4023	0	a	This game was honestly horrible in everyway. Hackers among just awful gameplay really made it a horrible game.
6003	0	a	would be good if it could start 10/10 
4538	0	a	The game itself is GOOD. But if you don't have the time to grow a thick skin and overcome a steep learning curve, you will not enjoy it, and you should likely not bother.  I'm NOT recommending this game until some major change will transform the game into something better. I would love so much to do it, but I don't feel like I should right now.  Update from Nov 18th 2015 - meh, still not that much of an improvement. Still a harsh game to learn, still requires to be thick-skinned. If you don't take it seriously you can still have fun, though.
6409	0	a	From what I have played it seems this game can be played as a pay to win mainly because everything in the game is mostly bought with real money if you want anything good just buy it all the really high damage guns and armour and everything can be bought without any real work.
4465	0	a	Unique game with potential ruined by incompetent team of weeb chimps.
5216	0	a	11/10 after 900 Hours punkbuster decides to kick me out everytime when i try to login.  but seriously, they updated their punkbuster so less hackers, P2W ofc. and the game needs to be fixed, if you have 4Gb RAM you cannot play this game it will be laggy. no more F2P items coming, only P2W items example pants what costs 20â¬ irl money. cannot recommend.
5735	0	a	Pay to win. Don't look further in the reviews. Heavily unbalanced due to the 'pay to win' system.
406	1	a	APB Reloaded features a Grand Theft Auto style gameplay, but the description doesn't lie when it says HUGE customization! I have played this game for a while now and have noticed a few features this game has that weren't mentioned:  1) the symbol editor, it's a Black Ops type symbol creator from what I can tell. 25 shape limit for free players but I was able to make Lagann with it so it's not too bad. 2) there is a neat voice chat feature that has an area effect, this means that people can hear you better in the voice chat from closer up so it can make for some funny scenes! 3) work with either faction! I know that's obvious but I wanted to say either side you choose is fine! Make your decision on what missions you would rather do. What I can tell is that the clothing can be made from either faction. 4) when buying clothes, just go for what shape you want because you can edit anything as long as it isn't the stuff you have equipped when you start. Last but not least, check you email when you make an account because you might get some cool deals sent to your inbox! Heck, my characters in it are proof that as long as some one is human, they can be made in APB!
8077	0	a	Not a good game. Much cheater, nobody to punish them. Glitch and cheat it's all you have to rememeber, people use auto aim and others glitch with game mecanical ( sit on the roof of a car to cancel a a debuff of speed)  COmmunity is very worst , people insult and just hit your car to make annoy you (its bring nothing just loosing you time)  THere is a mtchmaker in game but unfortunally it's the worst i never saw, you fight againt high level and high skilled people so you can't do nothing and you can't progress becasue oyu die every time.
1087	1	a	Okey heres the deal, this game is a hackers sandbox....with potential. All the old players understand that this game is good, it can be played for free even if its not ideal, and the customisation is what realy sets this game apart, but them hackers tho  Honestly when this game has cleared that problem up then this game will be great again, for any old player has played those matches without hacks were genuine skill were what counted and enjoyed them
10102	1	a	One of the best MMORPGs I have ever played! A real big game of PvP, so gear and kill players!
6917	0	a	Calling this a GTA clone is an insult to GTA. Calling it crap is a slap in the face of feces. This is just a terrible, terrible game with ps2 era graphics and gameplay.

10132	1	a	So much fun from a well designed free to play game! Never thought they would be this good.
2461	1	a	This is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing nice game! xD
7743	0	a	It may be free but not worth downloading its just not worth it in my opinion but look at some gameplay and see if its your sort of thing but from me 5/10
2802	1	a	Simple Cops vs Robbers but highly addicting ! One of the Best F2P Games
7724	0	a	i could not even play as soon as i finished making my character it would not let me enter the world. Fix please i really wanna play.
4340	0	a	Spent three hours in a mock demolition derby and poledancing on top of other people's cars, paid off cops who pulled me over for speeding with a safe full of diamonds I'd just stolen right in front of them, 20/10 would play again.   To be honest, 9.5/10 people who try to play APB are going to be slavering at the jaws with rage within 15 minutes of entering their first server. The game is heavilly PvP orientated... Unfortunately, the PvP is weighted heavilly in favor of anyone who pays exorbant sums of money for the best gear. Not to mention the highly experienced, well-geared high levels that come to the starting areas to murder new players.   In terms of concept and general gameplay, APB is a wonderful game. Imagine an MMO version of Saints Row or GTA, with players being both criminals and cops. That's the general idea behind APB Reloaded. Unfortunately, as mentioned before, the player versus player that is cventral to the concept is horribly unbalanced. To give you an example, a fresh player with reasonable third person shooter experience can pick up a weapon off the real money market and dominate matches just like that. Now imagine an experienced player with that same weapon. It's one of those cases of a free-to-player attacking a paying player and the paying player essentially going 'Lol, stop it, it tickles! Here, have some bullets!'   I've touched on the subject a bit already... The game's community. To be frank, APB's community is utterly terrible, filled with asshats, trolls, and plenty of children who think they're MLG level hot stuff. Combine this with that pay-to win imbalance... Yeah, a ten year old with his daddy's credit card will kick your â¥â¥â¥ more times than you'd care to admit. And both children and adults will announce their pro skills and taunt each other and whine about Haxoorz in the chat. Oh yeah. Hackers. They're there. Not as much as a lot of the people in the game would tell you they are (Every time they die) but they're definately there and a force to be reckoned with.   Did I mention the customization?   I didn't mention that, did I? silly me.   The level of customization you can apply to your character and vehicle is... Mind-boggling. Simply glorious. It's the main strength of the game, in my opinion, but unfortunately it's subscribed to that same Pay-to-win philosophy as the rest of the game... Less so, however. Put enough time into it, and you, as a free to player, can potentially look just as cool as that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ who sunk 2000 bucks into his kit. He may be able to one-shot you with his god-pistol from a mile away, but hey, at least you'll leave a cool-looking corpse!   My advice for playing this game? Avoid actually playing the game like you're supposed to. Don't play the PvP, you're bound only for frustration and rage. Do side activities, They award more cash faster and, while they can get a bit monotonous, there's plenty of ways to stay entertained. Remember what I said about the demolition derby? Actually happened. There's plenty of people in the game that are just as bored as you. Oh, yeah, there are decent people, it's just that the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s are pretty loud. Criminals can make cash a lot faster than Enforcers, simply because their activities are largely dependant on the envirionment- mugging, robbing stores, jacking cars, you get the picture- whereas most of the Enforcer's income is largely dependant on criminals. And that PvP. You want cash as an enforcer? Gotta engage criminals in PvP to get it. Which is probably why the beginner areas are always swamped with high-level Enforcers. They want some easy cash.   Honestly most of this game's problems can be traced back to the Pay-to-Win PvP and the Enforcer's lack of quick cash income. THe only way to really have any fun with this game is to â¥â¥â¥â¥ around. As a free-to-player, attempting to take the game seriously will only end in your frustration.   I rate the game's premise 9/10, but the game in it's current state 3/10.   TL;DR: You're going to die to kids with their daddy's credit card a lot. Look forward to a toxic community and lots of salt in the area chat 24/7. Hey, the character customization is really kick-â¥â¥â¥, though!
8841	0	a	What got me to try it was its intricate customization system but, sadly, it wasn't fully accessible without having a Premium account. Along with my other disappointments is that the game is Pay-to-Win, meaning that new players can just buy off stronger items (with real-world cash) than to work hard for them. I don't recommend this unless you have a stack of money to burn.
4331	0	a	great game! great customization, very fun  1) pay2win -3,0 2) terrible optimization -2,0 (you will need to buy a computer directly from nasa to play this, and you may still get lowfps)  my opinion: VOTE 5.0/10
2604	1	a	Game is super cool.T.H.E.B.E.S.T Cool, Cool, Cool, Cool, Cool GAME xD             
5412	0	a	dont spend time on that game. full of hackers. anti cheat ban you when you get over 50 reports. this game fall into a wrong hands (GamersFirst)
8267	0	a	because the car swallowed my memes so crie if u ned 2
4984	0	a	Fun, until you run into a mission with hackers, and aimbotters. Leans towards the Pay2Win side quite heavily.
8087	0	a	apb reloaded is fun and all but why didn't the dynamic events=drug mule,the butcher, why didnt they come up anymore they should actually start doing drug mule and butcher and im almost finished with the tutorial but how am i gonna finish the tutorial if u guys didn't put the drug mule or butcher anymore
8780	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥
3078	1	a	some times it does not work ama try again
7827	0	a	I was exicted when I first heard about this game coming out, back before they cancelled it. I'm not sure who picked up the ball and finally released it as 'reloaded'... but I gotta say I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone who isn't a diehard fan of Grand Theft Auto. Or if the diehard fan of GTA were to be insulted by this game really, but if your looking for online interaction with your fellow GTA fans, just play GTA online with their latest release.
6987	0	a	its not as fun as they make it out to be
6569	0	a	No real updates for years, mostly based on pay to win. Gets very repetitve, but a decent play at times. Community is mostly bad due to the fact that no one will show you any kind of mercy, but there area few friendly players who try help. I strongly recommend not spending any money on this game if playing at all.
261	1	a	highly addictive and heaps of fun with friends i defs recommend it to ppl looking for laughs
9014	1	a	I haven't played this game for ages, i've re - read the description to remind myself of what had happened, it's basically Fallout or DayZ. Imagine the way you do things. A massive roleplaying game awaits.
4276	0	a	It's a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ not even worth the money 0/999999999
4188	0	a	this game wont even work for me ive tried everything if someone knows how then please tell me 
531	1	a	this game is really good, Very fun to play with friends. 'It's awesome'
9226	0	a	now this game is not good than before :^(
9295	1	a	ITS OK 50/50 depends on what your looking for
2939	1	a	This game is so very addictive i have never written a review for a game befor but this game is awesome its a little PTW but the amount of joy and awesomeness far outweighs that negative impact... huge wepon selection... lots of different single player type missions and group mission (group missions are a bit on the repetitive side but if you got a good group its fun and there is nothing like jumping in a car and trolling the boys in blue with a few homies in your back seat droppin brass....)  If your looking for a fun time killer and wanna shoot some ppl up as a cop or outlaw this is your game i highly recommend this to GTA lovers....
4355	0	a	If they would replace the mechanics with gta's it would have been a great game,as it stand's now it's not great.
7093	0	a	This game sucks. way to much bs just to get to the part where you actually play. just a lame game period

5544	0	a	GTA for poor people  Pros -... -Riddled with hackers yet not as many as GTA V currently has?  Cons -Pay to win -Extremely boring -Toxic community -Only way to make the real cash is by either paying for it or by playing a hundred PvP missions, or a thousand PvE missions, it's like you're getting punished for not wanting to play against other players, which is extremely dull. -All the cars are basically one big hitbox, you can't shoot people through car windows and the top speed is basically the same for all vehicles. And if you want to customize your character or vehicles to a higher extent you need to pay real money for PREMIUM.  To sum it up. It's dull as â¥â¥â¥â¥.
8728	0	a	did i really spend 6 hours doing nothing
9996	1	a	This game... Well simply I picked it up on a whim and got addicted to the crafting system, the first crafting system to actually make sense. Besides that being a shooter mmo it is not like most mmo's where its press tab and sit back; no on the contrary you better aim your gun or weapon carefully.
8070	0	a	First i would like to say this is one of the best games out there despite the Pay for more mindset of this game. costumization is crazy deep detailed but the default substcription you carry as a new player limits you to 25% of this games costumization capabilities. that aside there is also very anoying mechanics in this game specially playing as a bandit or criminal. a enforcer can handcaff you from miles away limiting your abillity to fight back or even try to brake restrains. little things like this are game braking. i havent spent much time in this game to give you a detailed idea of everything in this game. another thing that really bothers me is the community simply because its mostly filled with a very young community fan base. it bothers me i have to go online and play with 10 year olds. this game has the potencial to be the best game on steam for GTA fans and i think if taken in the right direction it would surpass GTA in many ways. i recommend it for a casual gamer not someone thats looking to take the most out of this game becouse that? .... well thats just impossible unless you â¥â¥â¥â¥ gold bars.......
5374	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ Gta Online with a touch more Pay to Win.
10607	1	a	Cool RPG with hundreds items, characters customization, different enemies and open world. 9/10 :D
1199	1	a	Good game, Good gamplay, I think this game shouldnt be free i should be 19.99
1485	1	a	Love this!
4198	0	a	After 3 years of playing it,I can make a review: First of all,this game is in the category 'pay2win',for example a DLC with a few costumes,vehicles and some weapons that are NOT permanent costs 93â¬.Not to mention that you can really enjoy this game after you pay at least 100$.. These are the pros: -Great character and vehicle customization,it even include a symbol designer,which you can use for creating your own symbol -Each mission has his own story,like delevering a briefcase or killing the opposite team Cons: -You have to pay at least 100$ to enjoy -Laggy -Still full of bugs -Hackers -The gold ranked players invading silver ranked servers -It gets boring,it has only 2 mission districs,1 social(in which you can customize your character,vehicle and socialize),and 2 other districts in which is only team deathmatch;excluding events -â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t community,if you haven't spent 50$ or more you are considered a 'noob' -If you are new or think of start playing this game,you stand no chance agains the player with OP weapons that cost over 500$. Back in 2011/2012 it was better,even thought were still some problems My rating for this 'game' is 5/10
8005	0	a	worst game ever and i lost a bro because of this game. 0/10 never play
6967	0	a	it cant even load
6525	0	a	Its bad 0/10
8916	0	a	The uninstall button worked. Nothing else.
7313	0	a	WOULD YOU LIKE TO BUY A PISTOL FOR 99 CENTS IN REAL MONEY? 
1981	1	a	this is a great game, just get it it's free for F***SACKE!
5337	0	a	Fun for a couple hours, but quickly becomes nothing but stressful.   Extremely toxic community. Less than lethal weapons used by enforcers are stressful as â¥â¥â¥â¥ to use and essentially useless unless you have sunk hundreds of hours into the game. Seems like 50-60% of the community uses snipers, so you just get â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sniped over and over. Driving controls are absolutely miserable unless you invest a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing TON of time to get a nice car, or get a pay to win car. Overall, it's just sort of pointless. There's no reason to take your rank seriously, there's no reason to give a â¥â¥â¥â¥ about the game. it's primarily a small community of veteran players and if you are new, it is impossible to get into it.   If you just want to â¥â¥â¥â¥ around in it with friends for a bit, go ahead. Otherwise steer clear. If you own it, just play GTAV. 
7187	0	a	I do not reccomend anyone to waste his time by playing this game. It's poorly made and very inbalanced. The match-making system is terribly broken. You'll often find yourself, a low lvl 5 guy against lvl 200 players. It's very frustrating, progress is very slow and unrewarding. The game is very poorly made and optimized, the physics engine is terrible, steering lags a whole 3-4 seconds making car driving close to imposible. The game is full of trolls and rammers and the overall atmosphere of this game is of hate. The most commonly typed sentence in this game is 'â¥â¥â¥â¥ y0u N00B di3 â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥!' Many players were banned for no reason because of an upsurge of cheaters and with every patch the game just keeps getting worse, the only additions being new stuff to rob money from you with. I DO NOT Reccomend this garbage to anyone.
1410	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥
7375	0	a	Interesting gam concept. Deemedlike it would be a lot of fun. But Laggy gameplay coupled with either incompetent or malicious teammates made the game unplayable for me.
8763	0	a	Great game back in the day but pretty much dead population wise. GTA Online killed what was left when that came out. I'm amazed the servers are still on.
3882	0	a	Like games where the 'good' players are a selected few who are willing to spend IRL money in the game for op gear that cancels out the skill factor of games? well no further because within 4 hours of me playing and enjoying it i have encountered two players with weapons that can kill me within a matter of seconds from any distance. a game with alot of good potential with developers who clearly dont care isnt a good combo and this is a incredible example they remove the fun out of a game that is basically GTA online PLEASE DONT PLAY THIS GAME for your sake it is trash and will ruin the joy you were having from it when you encounter the cancer of the games community
5878	0	a	the type of game where they charge stupid prices for the good stuff
8952	0	a	After playing for a little bit and ended up realising that this game just isn't fun. They give us an open world that is just completely empty, the hit boxes are horrid, and the fact that in order to PvP you have to accept duals is kinda stupid for a gaint game such as this. This game just feels like World of Warcraft with a Nuclear Apocalypse skin on it. Someone's review said it was like fallout. That is completely wrong it only looks like Fallout:NV (Gaint, empty, and brown being the main color) I would not download this game as it is a complete waist of time and space on your hardrive. Also one other thing, everthing goes by levels, so instead of going around and being ableto take on things and people because they have a gun and you don't you take things on because one side is mega level 9000 (just an expression) and your not. Leaving this unbalanced and enemies just plain boring. Especaily since you start out with a gun that can kill things from lvl1-10. Its just plain boring.
9810	0	a	this game is like if you date a drunk girl she gets drunk lett you go all the way but you still go out dry  (its fun in the start but sucks when the actual online starts)
787	1	a	This game is sooo like gta 5 and the graphics are good and theres all different guns 2 choose :) 
8824	0	a	This game is not fun. The customization is amazing, but that is the only good quality about this game. The driving is the worst I've ever seen, the combat is ridiculously annoying, and the overall feel of the game is crap. It's fun to force loser pedestrians to give you their money, but the animation is always the same, and it gets old fast.  While you are mugging the 30th half naked white girl, you will pray for a idiot to run her over in a car.   I give it a 10/10 'cause I'm an idiot.
3023	1	a	Best game ever . GTA+Saints row + multiplayer = AWESOME!
9572	0	a	Took 7 hours to download and it didn\'t work.

2612	1	a	a little laggy for me but great game this is like GTA F2P
5042	0	a	IF you love me you will love this game 
5353	0	a	90% time spent in customization the rest to dieing to pay to wins  Time well spent
207	1	a	it sometimes does the thing where it's enjoyable.
3194	1	a	This game is pretty cool for a realistic shooter.. doing crime is fun I haven't tried the Police yet.. its a bit too hard to shoot other players and I rarly played it enough for all the space it took on my pc so i uninstalled.. it was Enjoyable tho
96	1	a	if you play with friends it is very good game
10227	0	a	dont play this game for it sucks really bad!
1928	1	a	i watch some videos about this and i thought it was really good but i will have to play it first
2038	1	a	Full of circle strafing bunny hoppers
10843	1	a	An amazing free-to-play MMORPG that has had me playing for hours upon hours If you like MMORPGs, then this is one that worth your time
10345	1	a	The best mission-threads of any MMO I've ever played. Post-Nuke Bliss! ...but eventually PVP is going to rear its head, so be forewarned, if that's not 'your cup of meat'. I give it 8 out of 10, and no one gets a 10
7532	0	a	UPDATE, yeah well it's good game in a way if there not was so much PAY TO WIN over it + ever high is most time always a camping noob or a run away or just dont know how to attack or always wait on you to attack so more or less, most golds dont have any balls at all or just only sniper wtih a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing noob nano or some other armas noob weapons and yeah i have been really good to play this game a time but now i only play wtih friends more or less for after 2 years this game is all about PAY to WIN now and no longer about skills X( it's â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sad and yes as you can see i have played close to 2000hours and it's more for i played befor it was on Steam so i say give one try and if it sucks than just â¥â¥â¥â¥ it side ways ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- if you like GTA 4 you need to play this for it like GTA 4 in MMO just of cause you can lvl up and unlock things but you can close to customization all the way you want! :D for me it's one of the best game ever!
2353	1	a	It's best Game...download and play it.  It's Funny xD  E na figata scaricalo e provalo
1148	1	a	It has something the recent Saints Row have, but infact this game is alot better.   Gets out car, car goes kamikaze and kills me, would kamikaze again. 10/10
4809	0	a	Required me to like a Facebook page to play. Literally cancer.
583	1	a	This game is so bad!
10868	1	a	A fun game that can get really ennoying if you die but is still worth it
7599	0	a	Never even got it too load up
669	1	a	If you tired of GTA 4 PoliceMod Here You Are . You choose to leave a life of crime or protect the dumbass city , its fun but matchmaking sucks . When your lvl 1 you go against a lvl 30 or something its so stupid , but fun . I realy wish there was a 50\50 button so I could recommend it so I give this a 50\50 , 5\10 4\8 2\4 1\2 ALLTHE HALVES
10471	1	a	I like the game, but my tutorial glitched and I can no longer do anything :/ so I might set this one aside for a while
9560	1	a	Its not best game and not the worst. I really enjoy playing this. If someone tells me its a P2W game, im not listening him. Yes, you have boosters to harvesting, but you can get them for RP (Reward Points). You can buy premium in-game on auctions (of course, you must have some money).
1977	1	a	oh hi  nice game   i have 60R in this game :D
6574	0	a	cant open the game??? 
1147	1	a	10/10 would reload again.
10051	0	a	Wasting time simulator ;D
8984	0	a	Bad graphics, terrible interface, wonky AI, weapons do not have the kick... Do not download it even though it is free, it is a waste of time.
10895	1	a	One of my friends spent $100 on this game.
2960	1	a	Very fun to play with friends. Alone it's not as fun but still it is. Being a nice change to other Free 2 play MMOs.
6674	0	a	Terribly wasted potential. I was in the Beta for this game many years ago, and I even pre-ordered it when it came out. However, after Real Time World went under, and it was picked up again by Reloaded, everything went down the toilet. As said countless times before, the customization is amazing, and I really wish it could see it's full potential. However as we've seen, that's never going to happen.
3233	1	a	I love this game and would highly recommend it to my friends (if they're not already playing it) and want to delve into it more, unfortunately, I need to switch over to a 64 bit system in order to play it properly.
10404	1	a	Game is addictive, and community is excelent!
595	1	a	Cheeky Scrub m8.
7660	0	a	I just... I couldn't. No, never. Don't play this, waist your time on something else.
8239	0	a	Very laggy, most weapons are obtained through in game purhcases.Needs to be balanced.
2094	1	a	Really fun, any guns that are available for real money can be obtained with in game currencey. My only complaint is that it will sometimes randomly lag for apparently no reason, but but other than that it's a really fun game that's deffinentally worth a try.
7321	0	a	Tons of character variety. Fun PvP.  Downside? Falls into the Pay to win category, which just isn't for me.
6891	0	a	...
2163	1	a	Overall a really nice game. Has a nice character customization. I would compare it to a Saints Row / GTA mix. Great to play with friends and is overall very fun.
10239	1	a	Definitely the best game you don't have to buy.  Fallout Simulator to the max.  That being said......it is amazing, and it is addictive. Even more fun when you meet new friends to help you with quests!
3268	1	a	Now i dont really like many MMO's but this... is just AMAZING I just wish they would kinda stop thy lagg, if they havent really.
10660	0	a	This game SUCKS! All you are doing is running around, paying money and fight some bosses that spawn every second. Why could people call this a good game? Okay, the combat is pretty fun, but come on. Just running around with NO freaking goal?  2/10  It would be a 1/10 if the combat wasn't fun.
8137	0	a	Only thing I LOVE about this game is the custome tatoos, shirts, and cars, however, in order to gain full access to customization tools, you need to pay real money to unlock more layers...wtf! That is just a bumer for me, still manage to get some nice logos done. After the customization side of this game, it's pretty bad. It's pretty much GTA Online for F2P. It's call F2P, but those who spent real cash has a giant advantage over those who don't. Good weapons are all really high rank and requires a lot of grinding to get. This game is not beginner friendly at all.
1189	1	a	The game is pretty addictive by itself, once you get used to the intermittent lag that once in a while makes you rage. But it isn't game breaking as some other people in the reviews portray it to be. Its a fun, highly customizable game that is receiving an engine upgrade and console port somewhere in 2015. Buying stuff for real money off their marketplace is HIGHLY optional and I've never found the need for the guns, which by far are just better looking and sounding reskins of the existing in-game guns. There are also a significant number of community-wide contests held by Reloaded Productions giving away small items that almost convince you to go back every time. There are always OMFG moments though, as sometimes you could be facing highly co-ordinated teams that everyone accuses of hacking and are really not but you learn to roll with it. I have additional 1200 hours on this game besides the Steam count and have completed the progression thrice with different characters. The GMs have, in the past, promised a lot of things to be given a long time ago (read: a year). They have not delivered yet. This includes more content that isn't just a simple reskin, an engine upgrade and a new anti-hacking system. The last was implemented in Q4 2014. Simply put, this game can be very enjoyable and very annoying as well. As a new player in this game, it works to your advantage if you haven't played MMOs before allowing you to keep the tolerence to learn the game instead of rage quitting. You will die a lot and you will be abused a little by other players, but if you learn, you'll love this game...
9564	1	a	Best shanking simulator there is
737	1	a	It ril ged 
4636	0	a	Downloaded game and i couldn't play it      0/10
8173	0	a	THIS GAME used to be good i havent spent a single cent on it it used to be good....... But there is also one thing holding me back from this game is that there are no australian servers...... Turning and killing people is SO delayed over here i literaly have to press the turning button 3 seconds in advance for it to even turn and the deaths are so delayed its not funny. Gamersfirst if your reading this PLEASE make an australia server or an oceanic server alot of aussies will play this game if you had that.
10284	0	a	99% of my playtime was figuring out what the problem with the launch was.
7684	0	a	the game won't launch despite i already update my Nvidia PhysX to the latest version
10013	0	a	The only thing that matters in a game is 'is it fun to play' ans the simple anwser is no; I cannot recomend a game that is as dull as this. The concept is great, the execution is not.
3790	0	a	APB: Reloaded has gone downhill significantly since it's Free-to-Play release. While it still retains a good feeling for the gunplay mechanics, the prevelance and overzealous pushing of the cash shop along with annoying players with 'subscribe now!' advertisements tends to get in the way.  Over time weapons have been tuned in such a way that significant advantages (especially in lower threat levels and ranks) are outright purchasable with real cash, and these aren't cheap. Permanent weapons can cost upwards of a full $40 if not more, but at least now they're able to be applied to all characters on an account for a premium.  Cheating is a very common problem these days, be it via hacks or gaming the threat/matchmaking system. With no real appropriate ladder, and the overwhelming amount of people who feel that if they aren't winning they aren't having fun; we find that more and more players will use every and any trick in the book and out of the book to win with illegitimate results.  If you can get over those issues though, and play APB:R without too much invested in it with a few friends, you can have an absolute blast be it chasing down criminal players or resisting arrest from enforcers.  The question here is whether or not APB:R is good enough to warrant still being alive, and that's a debatable answer.
8610	0	a	Is not Windows 10 supported. Freezes right when it open have to restart computer

10523	0	a	fun, but some may not like the in game purchases 
8995	1	a	Oh... This game.  This game is worth playing just to see how legendarly bad it is.  In my adventures during this game I made a topless dude in a G string with a pink mohawk with the utmost classy name 'Bondageslave' and trolled so hard that the butthurt admins banned me despite not breaking a single rule. There's not many games that has the potential lulz factor of how bad this game is and even less with butthurt admin, but I assure you the admins here are a breed of their own.  Never have I seen a more raging group of admins on anything. Not even TF2 servers. So yes, I do recommend it. For the wrong reasons? That depends how you look at it. But personally I have never laughed so hard in the 0.9 hrs i've had on this game, untill I got banned.  If you ever get the desire to troll for 0.9 hrs and don't mind installing game that takes roughly 50 minutes to a hour, I assure you that you'll never run across more vulnerable victims.  The game is bad but the lulz is good.
8231	0	a	rly smexy pink
41	1	a	Best online game os steam!! :)
2330	1	a	Relly good game, i like it, i tell my friends for the game and they started playing.
6977	0	a	This game sucks don't play it it will make you cry and the developers spit in your eye DAMN you Gamers First DAMN you.
6020	0	a	Not only did I have to start off the game using a crap gun class I would never use and I'm not good at, the typical assault rifle. But the tutorial did not explain anything about how to get new weapon classes and the playerbase were just a bunch of trolls who said 'go play cod' or 'get good' I would flank up on an enemy, start firing at him first and not miss any shots only to have him turn around and kill me instantly. The vehichle physics are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, flipping your car over and I found myself killed by random players outside of missions constantly.  Worst game I've ever played, worst community, worst mechanics, worst options for character customisation (at the start of the game) ever.
1000	1	a	This game is unique and insane! So goooooooood!  Pay to win? More or less, this game is free, but this is more about skills than money, all reviews talking about 'p2w' is from crying babies.  I spent a lot of money in this game already, I have good weapons, good stuffs but a player without cash but knows how to play, can beat anyone easy.
6217	0	a	Absolutley horrid pay to win.  
4017	0	a	APB Reloaded is the same game as APB: All Points Bulletin, so if you did play it then and liked it then you will like it now. Behind all the good customization locked behind premium membership you find the bad combat that made it emerge as a F2P tittle in the first place. What made players leave in the first place is still there, what made players stay is still there tough whatever that was I cant see. This game should have stayed dead and burred, it was supposed to be GTA online because thats what we wanted and its not. Worth a try for the customisation alone, not worth staying for the combat for any amount of time.
654	1	a	If you tired of GTA 4 PoliceMod Here You Are . You choose to leave a life of crime or protect the dumbass city , its fun but matchmaking sucks . When your lvl 1 you go against a lvl 30 or something its so stupid , but fun . I realy wish there was a 50\50 button so I could recommend it so I give this a 50\50 , 5\10 4\8 2\4 1\2 ALLTHE HALVES
8474	0	a	Did not understand one thing about this game.Tutorial awful and cops keep killing new people that need help
4800	0	a	You cannot purchase any permant weapons without spending real life cash. Did my very first mission in the game with another new player and did not stand a fighting chance against our opponent who had far superior weapons then the basic starter gear. This is deffinately a Pay to Win game by design would avoid at all cost unless you want to spend a lot of money to be stand a fighting chance in this game.
7814	0	a	Terrible performance on AMD graphic cards. Lots of memory crashs and couldn't find any help in the forum for my problems. Game looks on max settings almost like on minimum due to a lack of optimization. If it runs well on your system good for you but if not invest a lot of time in trouble shooting...
3128	1	a	This game is AWESOME, been playing it for almost a year now. Ppl who read this. DOWNLOAD AND PLAY IT! :D
9990	1	a	This is one of those mission type/salvaging MMO's. I really enjoy this one. If you donât have this game, get it. Though if you have a normal computer, I would recommend you change the game graphic settings to their absolute lowest. If you do that, should be fine, otherwise you will rage quit from lagging to the point where you die from it. Because it is a 100% online game (no single player mode), most of the high end graphics is not needed.  Over all I really like this game. The lay out is great, I can play for hours at a time, and there are hundreds of achievements to try and unlock.  (8.9 out of 10)
5799	0	a	It's fun but
3648	1	a	best game in the entire world
1476	1	a	 I'd like to start this review by saying that this review is coming from a late 2011 to early 2012 veteran.   This is by far the game i have most played hours in and they're still going up. Overall i belive that this is a great game despite all the negative reviews and issues with it. Now i could sit here and list all the flaws with the game, but where's the fun in that? If you're able to look over some of the problems and get a few friends together to play this game, you'll probably not regret it.     Now to some common misconceptions...    This game is  not  pay to win.  Alot of people tend to think that because there are so many items you can buy through armas  (their real life money store) . But truth be told, most are just reskins of weapons that you can buy in-game by just playing the game. I'd say that the N-Tec  (their version of the AK)  is one of / if not the best weapon in the game. Which you can ofcoarse buy for in-game money or reskins on armas.   There are not as many hackers in this game as people belive.  There will ALWAYS be hackers in a free to play game. But alot of people think that every other player is hacking. I belive that this is not the case. I can't even remember the last time i faced a player i was sure cheated in some way. Most of the time it's that they have far better teamwork than you. They might be sitting in teamspeak giving out information to their teammates and so on. This is after all a team game. Like in CS:GO you're bound to do better in a team then you are on you own with randoms.     Here's a couple of tips for new players...    Do  NOT  join silver districts nor open conflict. When selecting a dristrict go into the advanced tab in the top-left corner and join a bronze district. All good players are in silver districts because of the way they have  â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up  made that system.   This game is extreamly CPU heavy. I for example have a 6700k. I get stable 100 FPS  (which is the cap with a 60hz monitor) . I used to have an AMD 8350. With the AMD i barley got 70 FPS and very commonly dropped to 40 FPS. You'll also need more than 4 gig RAM despite it saying that in the recommended. But you'll have to try out for yourself.     I did not cover the flaws in this review because if i do you'll just go and look for them. Enjoy the game as much as you can. This is despite all a very fun game, hence the positive review.    IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR WANT TO YELL AT ME FOR GIVING A POSITIVE REVIEW PLEASE COMMENT ON THIS REVIEW AND I'LL ANSWER.
7661	0	a	Pay to win game (with the weapons)! The system with the criminal and cops dont got the same balance. Your doing criminal things and the the cop-players coming from nowhere and kills you( every times!)
5662	0	a	makes you use internet xplorer when making an account
3344	1	a	I actually really like this game Pro: smooth gameplay(from asus computer) Con: REALLY LONG update time (on old computers)
10673	1	a	This game is so fun, it test you how much will you be able to survive and in the meanwhile unlocking other characters.!
5573	0	a	NICE Job Guys, FULL HACKS NOOB PLAYERS!
2055	1	a	Really fun to play with a group of friends! Great Customization! Sh*tty servers???? Lots of hackers??? Haven't seen many hackers but the server thing is kinda is sorta definitely true :L But still fun!
1092	1	a	the game itself is great and one request from this low-spec and low internet data budget person  -please make server on singapore or filipine or indonesia , so i (or even we) can play with small and more stable ping and make the game fun to all  even though that is the only trouble i have on this game , i still recommend this game to you guys   
10046	1	a	Got killed by a crab that had a computer monitor as its shell.   10/10
4268	0	a	Tried this game a while back for the costumization and cops vs robbers theme. It has seriously an impressive costumization feature by any game. However it's more like terrorists vs terrorists than cops and robbers rp.   More importantly, this game is the worst case of pay to play in an mmo I have ever seen. Literally only stock gear and few cars and useless clothes (no armor) are reasonably obtainable without hashing out real $. So unless you plan on throwing your cash at this game to buy ridiculously overpriced in game items and costumization features, don't waste your time. Furthermore, the divide between players who don't pay to play and the pay to play ppl is bigger than the divide between the rich and poor in a corrupt dictatorship. And you have the major hacker problem. This game is the king of rage quit and bullsh**  Seriously, this is a game that had huge potential and went horribly wrong. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME, MONEY, OR SANITY ON IT
5132	0	a	This game is alright. in my eyes i wouldnt play it 10 hours a day every day. this game is highly pay to win, and you dont get a lot for what you pay for. so many hackers in this game it isnt even funny. but all in all it is a great time waster. i just wouldnt recommend this game to people to want a fun game..
7429	0	a	Although there are some stuff that makes it good, there are many things that make it really bad, outweighing the good. Where noobies (people who just start) are paired up with people who are much higher level than them, giving them a huge weapon/money disadvantage. And also the one thing I hate the most, the 'pay to win' aspect, where most of the uber items are only obtained if you pay for the game, by microtransactions, or any other way where you must pay to get items that can only be obtained by paying for it. Its ok to pay for items, as long as it doesn't break the game (Hats in TF2/ Vanity items). But if its 'Hey I want this uber weapon that dominates all other weapons that you can get by ingame currency' then it breaks the game.
4512	0	a	A poor man's GTAV, but in GTA you only need to spend $60 once and you're good to go! In APB you don't pay for the game but to enjoy the game you have to shell out about $200 give or take. Everything cost real money or just spent a very long amout of time to get it. There is very few different objectives and you will be doing the same thing over and over again. The game really isn't that good and is very boring. Just do yourself a favor and not play this or you might go brain dead...   So basically the game is poop
4316	0	a	i played this game for well over 300 hours, it full of hackers, unless you wanna spend real money on this game. i would say dont brother, this game is truly cancer
2555	1	a	All Points Bulletin, or APB for short.....what to say? It's a 50/50 with me,   This is a great free-roam game, and the ability to make your own character is good. all the different vehicles you have to choose from are great, and the fine details on everything is nice to see.  However, there are problems (still decent for a free game). First thing being that you don't own any of the guns unless you go to Armas (and pay their BS prices), which could very well ruin your experience in the game; seeing as they don't know how weapon-fairness works. If you don't have a premium account, then you're limited in EVERYTHING (so don't go thinking big with those decals and clothing designs). While you're driving you might also experience this funny lag where your commands are a little late and you end up smashing into something.  Don't get me wrong, I like this game alot. Just don't go in with high expectations or you will be disappointed
7760	0	a	unless you like pay 2 win this may not be the game for you
8024	0	a	Calling this a GTA clone is an insult to GTA. Calling it crap is a slap in the face of feces. This is just a terrible, terrible game with ps2 era graphics and gameplay.
6768	0	a	game sucks. it doesnt even load up for me and for some reason everytime I wanna play the game it has to install everything again which takes about 2 minutes. Just play Killing Floor 2 instead people this game is horrible
2188	1	a	Amazing game when playing with friends!
9566	1	a	Just think a fallout MMORPG... or S.T.A.L.K.E.R, or any other apocalyptic game, but in an MMORPG form. Pretty self explanitory. But i guess i'll go into more detail with my ever-so-rare pros/cons list.   Pros_  MASSIVE open world that would take more than a full day to travel from one side to the other on foot. (but don't worry, there are horses and vehicles to help.)  A bunch of cool secrets to be found.  Interesting roleplaying potential.  Cool story and factions.  (bonus!) The low playerbase gives a good feel of isolation, really gives that extra immersion of an empty wasteland on a dead earth. Though unlike with fallout, having multiplayer makes the few players you will come across, means no two people will have the same experience, and be able to meet people with interesting stories and characters and such. Makes the dead world feel all the more alive.   Cons_  Intense learning curve.  VERY slow paced leveling and such with a lot of 'go here, kill this stuff.' Though it does have the redeeming factor of traveling places you wouldn't go otherwise and seeing interesting scenery.  Not too active playerbase, but the ones that are, luckily, are usually the ones that have been there since the beta.  Old game with dated graphics and stiff controls, though it has aged somewhat decently well.  Support died off ages ago, aswell as updates, for the most part.    Conclusion_  Its an old game, but a good one, and worth the look.
241	1	a	Pretty Damn Good Game, Love It, Just Wish My PC Could Run It, BTW That's A Compliment, Good Graphics
5219	0	a	One of the most unbalanced games I've ever played, and wasted money on, you have pistols that can out damage assault rifles and sniper rifles and if you want a good weapon you got to buy it with real money the ingame weapons they give you are â¥â¥â¥â¥ and this game has a lot of hackers. I can unload in a person with a good rifle and they won't die they hit me 3 times with a smaller gun or pistol I die. This game could be a lot better if it was balanced better and took better care of hackers. I play a lot of game and I'm fine with not being the best and dying now and then but come on, I even see people on the chat in game say how they are just gonna quit the game. I liked the game untill I kept running into the bs in the gameplay.
3419	1	a	This game. Still one of my top 5 fave games, even after playing it for a long time. Skills and reaction time is all you need to win in this game (and maybe internet with good connection). No matter if ur playing against people with premium weapons or not, the stock assault rifle is enough to handle anything. Maybe except for OSMAWs and OPGLs. Customization is also the most thorough one i have ever found in games, MMO or non-MMO. check out my screenshots and see for yourself what level of customization level im talking about. enough of me talking, Play The Game. May seem a bit complex at the beginning, but once you got the hang of it, its really simple and fun. WARNING. HIGHLY ADDICTIVE.
2818	1	a	Bears similiarities to Saints Row and GTA, steep learning curve but alot of fun. This game has been going strong for a while now and though progress is slow it is being update constantly, a whole new area has been added as well as multiple items which can be had at not actual cost. This game is the very formula for a proper F2P, there is no pay to win and should you chose to purchase a weapon or vehicle be certain you shop wisely since each is well suited to a particular playstyle.
2782	1	a	wow much shooter
10147	1	a	This is a game you can put hours and hours into and still have something to do. It has a very helpful community and moderators are almost always online. There is a very wide variety of weapons and clothing and you can also get many vehicles. It has an online store if you go on gamersfirst but it doesn't really give any advantage in terms of strength or firepower, the best you can get is premium and new mounts. Some glitches here and there including teleporting AI and wallhacking AI but thats most games. I haven't ever seen a hacker my entire 230 hours of gameplay so thats always a plus. To sum it up, it has a good engine to play on, VERY HUGE map and so many different missions and items it will keep you busy for awhile.
4642	0	a	Was a really bad game, I didn't like it, do not even try it.
3381	1	a	My review for APB Reloaded: Pros: Great game,I play it everytime and now im used to it. Massively Multiplayer which I like. Even though I dont like third person shooters,I still love it's gun physics. The game is stable which makes my computer totally crash. Has alot of things to do which I also like personnaly since there will be alot of playing and lots of fun too.  Cons: This game has HORRIBLE matchmaking. Game has too many bugs and glitches (espacially the wardrobe one.) Has too many hackers and Gamersfirst isnt doing anything about it. Game is p2w which I spent 50$ on just a rly bad gun. Chat has too many bad stuff and annoying people which I hate.  My rating: 8/10.Great job Gamersfirst.

2836	1	a	Rating 5~~~ Would love to give this game like a 7-8 but due to Aimbots and hackers this game can give you a hard time. So when play'n you might have to pick this game up and drop it for a bit to cool off if you get mad at games. Yest its a Free to Pay game i.e. youll be just fine with out getting out your wallet but be prepared when you face a subscriber or someone who just felt like sinking some money into the game. Very Cops &amp; Robbers/GTA/MMO style game. I say make sure you try it out but relize you have been warned.
5458	0	a	wont even â¥â¥â¥â¥ing work and its forcing me to like a facebook page and then says app is running.
4387	0	a	This game is kinda like GTA, just not as polished, big or open-ended. Or....well okay it's not really like GTA at all, apart from you roam around shooting people and stealing cars. Battles are fought in a series of urban maps between two sides, Enforcers and Criminals.  The game has a really, really good character creation and customization system. You really can do so much, height and weight, facial structure, skin tone, moles and scars and all sorts. Clothes are the same, able eventually to be worn in a multitude of colors, with lots of different styles.  The bad points, IMHO, outweigh the good however. The community on this game is absolutely atrocious. Exploititive, foul-mouthed keyboard gangsters constantly filling the district chat with all manner of nasty comments and what is essentially verbal griefing. I can't really stress how awful this community is.  The second worst feature is the driving and combat. Cars are horribly unwieldy and slip and slide like you're driving on an ice rink. The combat is very annoying, as you -will- be destroyed by bouncing, aimbotting 'veterans' with P2W guns that you simply cannot match unless you want to fork out quite a large amount of money. The gunfights are not fun. They really on having suprise and killing within three seconds, any longer and the hyper accurate, ultra-damage gun wielding other players will kill you with suspicious accuracy.  I don't recommend this game at all. The community is a festering, weeping sore that is hopelessly entrenched, and the gameplay is either clunky or skewed horribly in the favour of pay-to-win veterans who scream gangster hood references over the chat at eachother while aimbotting and hacking the game. Avoid.  Not worth even being free.
7148	0	a	Pay2play soooooo much... Game - 0 $ ALL DLC - 123,97$
7562	0	a	Confusing missions. Empty streets. Definite pay to win vibe: standard guns can't kill the enemy fast enough before they can kill you. Even from point blank range. Runs clunky on high graphic settings, even with a 2GB card
10444	0	a	Crafting, the game. Be prepare to spend hours upon hours of gathering materials to make your own equipment. The story is moot, and the game in incredibly newbie unfriendly.  Be prepared to learn how to do things on your own.
4751	0	a	Before I re-installed the game through Steam I had been playing APB for more than 2 years. What caught my attention to the game, apart from the fast paced shooter mechanics, was the mind-blowing amount of customization, encompassing character, clothes, tattoos, cars, death themes, etc. This is, I think, the unique selling point of the game, as I haven't seen something so broad in terms of customization in any other F2P game. Some of the holiday events made by the devs were genuinely brilliant and my liking of the game eventually got me to spend some money to support the devs so they could fix the server issues, lagging, etc. Sure, since Day 1 one of my biggest issues with the game has been the considerable amount of toxicity, but then again the developers are not to blame. Oh, and the occasional hackers too... oh dear. But whatever, I loved APB.  Then the Fire Natio- sorry, the Server Merge happened (supposed to fix the lag).  For crying out loud, what happened?! More lagging!?  It's disappointing to see that most of the server issues, weapon balancing, severe lag, (add any other claim made by the players) haven't been resolved and instead G1 has focused on releasing re-skins of weapons in their insanely expensive Cash Shops. Now I am partially kicking myself for having spent money on the game, but I really hope that the devs can turn this game around and actually listen to the players for a change. Until then I'll keep playing APB (I spent a good amount of money in the game, so I might as well continue even if it pains me).
2724	1	a	Very nice game
7536	0	a	It is a complete P2W game. 2 shotgun shells on the enemy can't kill him/her, and a few bullets, probably 3-4 from a rifle killed me. Turns out the enemy is a cash player and had a lot of attachments on his/her guns, and is also able to destroy a car in a few bullets.  Close to none PvE in the game, with almost no choice of weapons until a few weeks ago, which set you with only 2 permanent guns to choose from, which one of them is the default rifle.  Overall, unless you love getting owned by P2W players and was ok with being randomly teamed against players obviously stronger than you, it's a good game.

7486	0	a	I went into the game thinking most reviews and some posts about hackers, mass aim-bots and how crappy the game play was just irate people who are simply getting beaten badly as is normal on games that require some eye-hand skill.  Well I was wrong, the game is awash is aim-bots and script kiddies and the game has little to no security to even attemtpt to handle them so yo ucan be runnign down the street bunny hopping and get snipped in the head from 3 blocks away by someone you could never see.  So how the community is even worse then the CoD and Modern Warfare Xbox screachers, there most of the time you just find one or two that might be irritating but in this game, almost everyone is goign to be attacking you or think they are some internet 'gangsta' and have the same IQ as roadkill.

4036	0	a	A completely different rig and 3 years of time, still no 'new engine' (announced 2013). Still hard-locking my PC and forcing me to restart... On a completely new PC...     *I will admit, it is a fun game to watch streamers get mad at people blatantly hacking when the devs are too busy banning kids for swastikas, boobs, and â¥â¥â¥â¥ decals on their cars/clothes.

10513	0	a	To quote a friend, 'I just get mad at that game. Everything costs money.' Basically, I came for the bullet hell action and left due to the absurd amount of money the developer wants to weasel out of you to keep you entertained for more than 10 minutes at a time. $60 for a 'starter pack' that contains barely anything? GTFO.
7104	0	a	Worst â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game i ever played.
2418	1	a	This game is soo much fun, although there are stuff that could be fix to make it alot better but of course still is fun to play with friends and make friends also!
10022	0	a	wont even show the launcher, looks good but wont work...
5626	0	a	It was a good game until i found i had over 200 computer bugs lucky Norton saved my â¥â¥â¥!
8673	0	a	after 2 years i came back to play in every mission we got a cheater on the enemy team the game is now a war between cheaters
9306	0	a	i couldnt even play the damn game. i made my character simple enough but the moment i stepped into the starting area the game froze. so i waited until it unfroze and it did. once it unfroze i looked around with the camera and no issues. then i tried moving and froze again. repeted multiple times. apperently this is common and reproducable. the tells me that whom ever made this game either doesnt care about it or are dropping the game altogether. but all in all until this huge issue with the game is resolved you won't see me anywhere near it.
6134	0	a	Stupid, starter missions you get put up against high levels who have spent all their mothers money to get maxed gear, inwhich they just farm you from the get go, 9/11 wouldn't even bother with this pos
7805	0	a	UPDATE, yeah well it's good game in a way if there not was so much PAY TO WIN over it + ever high is most time always a camping noob or a run away or just dont know how to attack or always wait on you to attack so more or less, most golds dont have any balls at all or just only sniper wtih a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing noob nano or some other armas noob weapons and yeah i have been really good to play this game a time but now i only play wtih friends more or less for after 2 years this game is all about PAY to WIN now and no longer about skills X( it's â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sad and yes as you can see i have played close to 2000hours and it's more for i played befor it was on Steam so i say give one try and if it sucks than just â¥â¥â¥â¥ it side ways ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- if you like GTA 4 you need to play this for it like GTA 4 in MMO just of cause you can lvl up and unlock things but you can close to customization all the way you want! :D for me it's one of the best game ever!
10897	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥
7812	0	a	All Points Bulletin: Reloaded is a game that invokes many feelings. Off the top of my head, I can name relentless rage, grueling dissapointment, and cocky pride worthy of a guy that just â¥â¥â¥â¥ed Ariana Grande.  APB is a great concept. The backstory behind it is very deep, and the entire caracterization of the city of San Paro(however unoriginal that name might be) is very detailed and well done. It doesn't draw black and white lines: it's all a thick mist of grey, and it certainly asks you a question: are the oftentimes corrupt, control-obsessed vigilantes right? Or is it ethically correct to leave the city to the self-proclaimed renegades and anarchists, however chaotic and destructive they might be?  Remember, I'm talking about the CONCEPT here.  Because the realization of said concept is about as clear as a snowstorm in the deep ocean. The backstory and personality of the contacts and city is only presented by tedious text, mainly in the form of emails that most people just delete, or don't even bother to open. I even asked a friend, that has 20 hours clocked in the game, what the Enforcers were: he thought they were just straight-up police officers. That's just how bad the story is brought to the player.  Now for the gameplay. The core is good: Reloaded Productions managed to deliver a good third-person shooter, with interesting weapons and playstyles. The smart player that uses tactics will more often than not have an advantage over the kid that has spent countless dark nights crouched in front of his PC playing Call Of Duty, while perfecting his aim and surviving on Red Bull and Cheetos. However, like almost everything in this King Kong-sized dissapointment, this is ruined by two reasons:  1: The lag. Oh god, the lag. Unless the monthly cost for the servers is 3 bucks plus a cute picture of a cat, I cannot possibly wrap my head around how bad they are. Driving feels like standing on one foot. On a stick. Which is balancing on a banana held by a blind monkey with Parkinson. Often, during a unexpected encounter with a hostile player in the back alleys of the Financial District, I have either died because half of my shots didn't register, or I have won because my opponent's gun wasn't raised-which is a clear indication that some serious lags are going on.  2: The players. Sadly, the smart tactician is a long extinct species in San Paro, and the streets are now ruled by people such as 'Pu$$ySlayer69', 'lole_u_got_buttâ¥â¥â¥â¥ed' and 'UMAD BRAH??11?'. I am seriously not â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ you right now, I have seen all three of these names ingame.  Dare to be good, and you'll be called a dirty hacker. Dare to be even slightly worse than either your teammates or your opponents, or equip a weapon they dislike, and you'll be called n00b, â¥â¥â¥, and come to the realization that most of these people have had sexual intercourse with your mother, or that they wish you to do the same.  There are quite some topics I haven't covered, such as the hackers, which constitute, based on other people's calculations, 9,7% of the players. An alarming number, but hard to confirm, so I will leave it there. There is also the company known as GamersFirst. Sadly, these people seem to identify 'Gamer' as 'Man with a lot of money and no need for a honorable fight'. For excruciating prices, you can buy certain weapons that will shred through any average player. (Note that I'm not saying all of them are OP: a decent chunk are either reskins, or equally powerful as the in-game weapons.) The excuse 'you can get it in game too' is true, because you DO unlock modifications and bonuses as you go, but I myself have clocked over a hundred hours and all I got was a useless magazine mod and a slight increase to marksman zoom.  The customization is unrivalled, though. I have tried to find a game, ANY game, that has better character creation or vehicle customization, but to no avail. Shame, because this pearl just had to be incrusted in the (mostly) dried up turd that is APB.  TL;DR: APB: Reloaded is a great concept, that was insufficiently realized by Reloaded Productions, and completely â¥â¥â¥â¥ on by GamersFirst, after they took over the game. You could of course take a look, because, hey, it's free, but greedy business ideals have screwed over the concept so bad that the game is now singing it's dying song.

450	1	a	Well to start. This game has so many cons yet too addicting.The Matchmaking system is broken and its almost unplayed for new players.I can say the community isent the best neither.In Missions your always getting out guned by R255 guys or What ever.The game pretty bad atm but still would give it a try. 9/11

10642	1	a	i like the sounds
1159	1	a	Now before you write this off as a fanboy review, hear me out. Don't listen to the negitive reviews, this game is a ton of fun.   It plays a lot like GTA Online but in a free to play format. That sounds like a nightmare, i know, but it really isn't. It's kind of grindy, but that is to expect from a F2P game. Don't expect to have to play 100+ hours for a single item.  There is an endless amount of character and vehicle customization, this is half the fun for me. A really interesting thing they did with vehicles is how the radio works. You can import your songs and play them through the car, like the 'personal' radio channel in GTA. But wait, it gets better. Everyone in and around the vehicle can hear what you are playing, so the farther away the car is the less you can hear it. AND if you have the doors open(ie. when you are parked), the music is clear, and when the doors are closed, it's muffled. That's a very small thing to mention, but i like the attention to detail for this kind of stuff. I play this game myself and have made a few friends through this game, and it's a lot more fun if you have a friend to play with. Now, one of my favorite parts is that the chat is uncensored. It's hilarious.  Now for the bad:   The devs are almost non-existant. They're there, but updates are few and far between.  Hackers. They pretty much drove the game into the ground. The amount of people that play is low compared to any other similar game. FairFight keeps getting better, so there are a lot less hackers than there used to be.  And lastly, the textures and models are a little dated, gameplay could use some refining, and there are only 2 main maps. That being said, you are playing in a giant city so i can't complain wbout having more than one map.  If you can get past that, it's a really fun game to play, plus it's free, so it's definitely worth trying.  All 'n all, I would definitely reccomend this game.
8245	0	a	One of the best games I ever played but G1 goes hand in hand with the cheaters and alot of the cheaters are from the bigger clans and are friends with moderators etc so they wont get banned. I got banned for abusive language for life and switched to APB Innova a russian server, less cheater more fun.
5382	0	a	The only upside i got to mug the easter bunny.
6769	0	a	I can't even play it -.-, Can someone help?
5233	0	a	I honestly dislike this game. The game is repetitive and boring. You litterally do one mission in the misson mode. You crash into windows and collect loot too sell for low amounts of money. You shoot others in PvP. You get team-killed in missions, making them only possible when you don't have a group of idiots on you're team. The servers apparently lag. I didn't have the issue, but most people in the game said they did. I only experienced server delay. Press 'A' for a turn, doesn't work until a second later. Sometimes not the best thing. I do not reccomend.
5191	0	a	I think honestly they should have tried making changes way earlier when they were just starting out, rather than waiting 3 years to try and change anything. The lighting now sucks and the graphics are terribly all over the place. The weapons keep getting rebalanced even when they're in a perfect state, unecessary changes to a lot of things instead of where it actually counts.
8655	0	a	Aids so much aids not restrictions so everyone uses aimbot and its pay to win â¥â¥â¥â¥ that â¥â¥â¥â¥
9315	0	a	this is the worst post-apocalyptic rpg i have ever played. play fallout instead of this.
4873	0	a	pay to play . no freedom on symbols , clothes, cars u need pay for all ............ 1,3,15,30 or more day unless ur limited at 3,7 symbols per cloth,car..... HIGHLY NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME!!!!
3530	1	a	If you combined the way preschooler's view cops and robbers with the worst cops and robbers action movie in the world, this is basically what you'd get. Somehow, the game is still enjoyable...mostly.  10/10 would be the best bikini cop again
6797	0	a	When i joined this, it was fun, but it forced me to have to buy more ram just to play, but even then i lagged during any battle..  reason i dont reccomend this: SUPER cpu heavy, it lags bad if you dont have a serious up to date graphic card or more then 8gb ram, seems they put alot into graphics which causes older computers or people who dont buy computers every year not able to play it.  i still login from time to time, but it became un-fun when it was nothing but trolls bashing your car/truck into walls with garbage trucks, or children screaming on the voice system just to annoy you.  i dont reccomend this if you have a older cpu, or cant handle the graphics, also if you cant deal with kiddy trolls bashing you every 5 mins not allowing you to do anything.
956	1	a	this game. it is great with some minor flaws the biggest flaw being that it is very brutal on new players if you havent played 100-200 hours do not expect to be any good what so ever. other than that the game is great runs well on a mid price pc, and has fair fight active most of the time. if you get this game just give it time keep playing and chat with people the community is quite nice and they do not mind helping people out! overall if you like a good shooter that is similar to GTA then try it out its wurff! :)

2935	1	a	This game is a ton of fun. Once you start making some customizations, and realize that you won't win every fight, you begin to grow and have a lot of fun. There are tons of options to chose from without ever paying, but the paid XP boost is very helpful.
6077	0	a	P2W Reloaded  P2W=Pay to win just in case you ask
2800	1	a	After playing this game for over 120 hours, I've finally realised that it is just a ploy for money. Having said that, I should also bring to light my very many laughs and good times I've had with this game. With the 'missions' and pvp so frustrating, the only redeeming quality of this game is customization. Filled with infinite possibilities, the game is fun, however tiresome and rage inducing. I'll have to give it a 6.5/10
2143	1	a	Ä°ts Fantastic game I playing this game 7/24 :D
5139	0	a	This game nearly destroyed my computer! It is so buggy and so unorganized that I could not do anything, play with any of my friends, most of the time I couldnt play it at all. It takes half of your lifetime to get it downloaded and logging in takes up more time than me actually playing this piece of trash. I had to turn my computer off 4 times in 2 hours because it froze my computer or prevented me from playing anything else. I feel like an old person after how much time I've wasted trying to give my effort purpose. How could Steam even consider bringing this horrible mess into their beautiful community of great to way better than APB Reloaded games. Gaben hear my words you awesome god and burn this evil game of devil spawn at the stakes, please.
5599	0	a	I have created a character. About to choose which server im going to play on. Click on the one with lowest ping. And then I cant click the next button. Whats the problem?
4055	0	a	240% more unclear than running blind. Tutorial is crap, stock gun is crap, 3/4 of the game is worse.
1786	1	a	This game is fun but occasionally you get people that rage which is fine couse well... they mad.
7292	0	a	no instructions on how to play. Sorta of a tutirial with broken parts.  when you do learn how to do a mission.. it put's experanced players against you to kill you before you even learn how to play the game.  
8191	0	a	this game was bad when it came out and it still is. too bad, good idea, just done horribly.
3017	1	a	It's decent now that it's free and I HIGHLY reccommend you play with friends rather than alone.  Customization options are still awesome, though you're limited if you've got a free account. Not to say that you can't create something awesome with that though ;)  Of the free to play games I've played, the gun play in this game is great. It feels responsive enough to pull off pop-shots and quick swipes across your mousepad.  As for the guns themselves keep in mind that different weapons fill different roles. The game might not do a great job of teaching you what to do off the bat but it's fairly simple once you get used to it. i.e.: A SMG or shotgun will generally lose at range to an assault rifle; Assault rifles are good all-around. The starting rifle (STAR 556) is not to be underestimated, you can definitely outplay other 'paid'/'armas' guns with the right strategy.  Speaking of strategy, it plays a HUGE role in the game. A bit too much to explain in a little box here, but just remember to use the camera/third-person-view to your advantage, remember to check your flanks, and remember to stay in cover. As with any shooter, you'll have to learn the maps for the advantages each area holds, and how to counter them, how to flank them.   Once again, gaming is always fun with a friend, and for free? Sure, why not.

1088	1	a	I played this when it was in beta even though my in game hours don't show it. I can recomend this game to others.  Pros: Easy reward system for quests. Easy to fallow Quest system. Cars with atributes that are resonable( maybe not some will come with a big price tag on them), and some what customize-able. Striat forword Totrails when offered. Unlock ranks for some guns/ cars.  Cons: Like any other game that is free there is a paiying side, is the paying side rewarded more, yes and loads I haven't played in a while and can't tell but, some times on either(cops or criminals) side there would be an extremly high level high ranking player sitting on the edge of town with a sniper shooting into spawn, halours events fallowed. Car controls last I played were jarring and unstable unsre if it was becuase of type of car. (Yes that matters alot in ths game).  I cann not say much about the rest of the fetures of the game becasue I acullty haven't exploered all that much. I may change my review later for a better desription and general knowladge.
8013	0	a	DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME IT IS SO BAD IT MAKE SONIC 06 AND SONIC BOOM LOOK LIKE MASTERPIECE'S THIS GAME IS JUST SO BAD JUST GET GTA V ITS 100000000000000000X BETTER THE DRIVING IS POOR THE GUN PLAY IS EVEN WORSE THE MISSIONS ARE THE WORST.... WAIT NO THE WAY YOU MAKE YOURSELF IN THE GAME JUST DOESNT WORK THE GAME IS SO UNFINISHED ITS JUST REALLY BAD I WANT MY 1.2 HOURS BACK.
7068	0	a	[OLD REVIEW, SEE NEW BELOW THIS Recommended Meh. 6/10. It's not that great of a game. There's constant lag no matter which server you choose to spawn in, and that interferes with some cool sound effects that would be greata otherwise (car engine, car radio, etcetera). The gameplay itself is great, but really, REALLY pay to win. You can't even get a permanent weapon without paying, but that doesn't matter much, because these weapons are cheap, and you DO get one permanent weapon in some early days of playing. The co-op open world sandbox is great. I love driving around competing against other groups with a group of friends while driving around in an ambulance or feeling the pressure when I do the drug mule event when other players hunt me down. Lag interferes a lot with pvp though, just a heads up. [NEW REVIEW, 12/22/15] Oh God... 2/10. It's a terrible game. Do not come to this game looking for a game with the freedom and open worldness of Grand Theft Auto V, for thou shall not find it. Do not come to this game looking for the humor that surrounds Saints Row 4. For thou shall not find it. Do not come here looking for the sandbox flexiblity of Garry's Mod, for thou shall not find it. Do not come here looking for the combat mechanics of Call of Duty, Counter Strike, or any other good shooter games, for thou shall not find them here. Do not come to this game seeking the great community of Reddit, for thou shall not find it here. Do not come to this game with high hopes, for thy hopes will be brutally smashed. Do not come to this game at all, for thine brain shall be spared from having to keep the terrible memories of playing this game. But seriously, do come to this game looking for a great character customization, it's one of the only pros I could think of, and it's quite possibly the only positive aspect of this entire game. Aside from playing it with some good friends of course, but even that's not available to everyone 24/7.

1703	1	a	This is a great open world, free to play shooter giving multiple missions and vehicles to mess around with (as well as loads of guns.) The graphics are great, gameplay is fluid and exhilirating and the game hooks you in and makes you want to play more.  Only few criticisms I can give is that the missions are fairly repetitive, and that there are sometimes giant lag spikes (this could just be due to my internet of course.)   I recommend this game and I would give it an 8/10.
8720	0	a	It sucks that players that want to invest in the game itself, have much bigger advantage than others.
9764	0	a	As entertaining as stapling your ballsack to the ceiling.

379	1	a	It worth all the costs... 'cuz it's free :D
10780	1	a	Lacks much variability and thus may become boring and repetitive at times. Can be unfair and ridiculously challenging at times, even with decent equipment. Tutorial only teaches you only basic controls and then throws you out into the open world with little knowledge of what to do. The amount of in-game purchases they try to force down your throat is quite frankly astonishing. These flaws aside, it's an addicting; fun little game.

1055	1	a	This game is awesome there is alot of things to do more than gta
6722	0	a	APB~  + Decent graphics   Customization  Open world  Impound   ~ Guns and vehicles (the cheaper set) are rented for a few days    - Matchmaking is unbalanced most of the time  Missions are repeatitive and some are unfair  Buying powerful guns with real money  Hvt when doing great (I forgot what this is called. Wanted/Heat level?)  Too much shooting   *Note: I never used real money to purchase anything.*  This was a fun game when I fisrt started playing it. Being able to customize my character to whatever I wanted and having almost the same for the car was nice also. The graphics were OK, and the amount of guns, clothing, and veheicles to choose from was moderate.   Gameplay itself was decent. It was fun exploring the area and going after the criminals and getting paid for it. Most missions were fun to do and most of the time I did have a good team. After awhile however, the missions dd tend get repetative. Especially if the player is solo and searching for a mission/group. Many times I had gone with a team of 4 against a team of 2. Other times it was an equal match but the player levels were unbalanced. Whether or not I failed, the same mission would usually pop up after the next or right after that. Also, it's awesome when a player is doing great on a mission then all of a sudden becomes a High Value Target and everyone is alerted to that HVT. Now, that player that was doing great has around 20 players hunting their â¥â¥â¥ for a bounty. Usually they were killed within 15 seconds.  I'm honestly a bit mixed on the gun/car lasting only a few days. Guns I can understand, even the paid ones to *try* and balance the game. But I hated paying a lot for a car that would be gone in a few days. It would take awhile to get enough money to ..I guess one could say to 'rent' a vehicle since payment was little and I started to be matched against higher levels. The money I was saving then had to be used for a better weapon if I wanted even a chance at killing some. Even the default gun players receive at the start is fairly balanced. I've killed many with it. But it doesn't compare to a sniper rifle that is a one hit kill.   Most players kept to their self. Others were chatting on the global chat which was mostly friendly. The rest were of course people trolling. I only had trouble with a few and the rare person that laged like hell. (or hacked)  What I played was fun...  ...Till I was killed 22 times trying to get to a mission objective and being blown up by someone on the opposing team with a RPG. No matter where my team and I went, there was always somebody waiting in a corner, or at the objective. I did get to run over the person once though! Why stay for 22 deaths? I don't like to rage quit.   Since then I would drive around waiting to see some action pass by. Then when a group went by I would follow them to the objective then take the cars they stole from the civies and impound them for cash. Which was pretty good if they stole a high performance veheicle. Especially armored trucks. Oh, and the vehicle wasn't damaged too bad.  - I can't say I fully enjoyed the game since I died *alot* from people who used real currency to purchase their guns. However, because of that, I can't fully recommend the game. I could over look the matchmaking (since CoD did that alot to me) and the missions. But it doesn't work in the end. Think this qualifies as a 'Great concept, poor execution' kind of game for me.  
3358	1	a	cool
1914	1	a	it deos take a long time to download but after you have tryed clicking play and all the other bits and bobs of clicking then it might work or it might not but saying all of this i would recommend this game because when you get the game starter the graphics are nt bad but the only things that dissapoint me is that it takes a while to start when you first get it and the game is quiet confusing for example how to change your outfit or how to upgrade on certain stuff like a gun or a car it is quiet hard but you do get a tutorial and when you drive car it is quiet glichy that might just be me im not sure but over all i would recommend this game  soz for quiet alot of negitive comments apb reloaded but i have to write a review on what i think
1933	1	a	i reccomend this game if you are going to play with a group of 2 or more, if i had to point out a negative about this game it is that it takes abit of time to launch so if yours doesnt open up instantly give it sometime,
30	1	a	Its cops and robbers meets gta, fun stuff.
8523	0	a	i used to love this game, but coming back to it now i see its just another grindy steaming pile of p2w garbage. the only way to actually beat any missions is either rent expensive better weapons (you cant actually keep the good ones as they expire) or hope the enemy team is too busy killing you to actually do the objectives. you can grind money for better gear but it takes forever with the tiny payouts, and theres always going to be that jackass with his parent's credit card running around with all the good â¥â¥â¥â¥. importing music is just terrible as it usually auto-deletes any copyrighted song so i have to wonder why that feature is even there. the lag is horrid, makes it hardly playable. The game's clothes and vehicle customization is the best thing about it, but getting good looking stuff requires you to unlock and max out huge strings of npc experience, for basic items like shirts and masks, which wouldn't be bad if doing so wasn't tedious. decals are also limited unless you get the premium.  long story short; if your looking for a terrible, generic p2w game you found it.
6559	0	a	This game did certainly look good at first, and I love police sims, though there sadly are not a lot of them around. I enjoyed this for a little bit, but soon it began to get boring and repetitive, and this is primarily pay to play. Therefore, I would not recommend this game, because it isn't worth it to pay for some crap in quite a horrible game. Don't play this game. It will waste your time.

3779	0	a	After playing this game extensively for a time,  APB is not in the slightest new player friendly in both mechanical and playerbase aspects. The playerbase is full of venomous, toxic people. Should you get involved with the community, you can expect DDoSers, griefers and undesirable people to bother you.  Mechanically speaking, APB does not in any way play like any other shooter. Many people will pick up an assault rifle, press right mouse and hold down the trigger, which rarely works. The gunplay sits solely around extremes, there are no in-betweens like in most shooters, which I personally find silly. Only shotguns and SMGs will be found in close quarters. Only snipers, semi-autos and (sometimes) assault rifles will be found in long range. You have to frequently change guns depending on the environment, which can be an extreme problem if you don't have premium, because there is a lengthy cooldown for the ammo box which can be used for changing guns and re-stocking. The only way to negate that long cooldown is to own premium.  The matchmaking is also hopelessly broken, and veterans will be placed against new players.  APB also suffers from a item shop dilemma. There are certain guns that are extremely potent, which can only be purchased via the armas market. Originally, you could outgun the OCA whisper or the CSG, but now there are pocket SMG guns, such as the Oca Nano, the extremely high ROF SMG that can be used like a rifle that is the ACES gun, so on and so forth. They aggressively market their items and don't even attempt to make a F2P variant that can compare.  The Developers are not only ridiculously greedy, but they also lack any talent. Most content is re-hashed or has minimum effort applied to it. Bug fixes are slow to happen. They've done nothing to fix the rampaging numbers of cheaters which have plagued the game since beta, aside from occasionally catch someone who's too blatant, or false ban someone who may be godly good at the game. On the subject of bans, a developer has come out and flatly said that all bans are final and that they are cheaters, no matter what.  The only redeeming qualities I could even offer is that the customization is unmatched, the vehicle play is a fascinating idea and the open world missions are a great idea, but could certainly use a lot of tweaks at later level missions.  I personally believe it may be too late to save APB, and that it should be sold to another company so that the customization can be harvested for a much better game.    
3953	0	a	Bah, I played this, Got really good with my arrests, and was banned because I got reported to many times for using the LTL weapons all the time. Arrests get you the most money and points, and they are pretty easy to use, But you will get banned for using them as you primary all the time in Fight Club, Shame, I spent a pretty penny on this game as well, I was a Closed beta tester, I fell in love with the customizations and the idea this game was going for.
7896	0	a	this game does not run its a ripoff
3041	1	a	Good game, basicly is GTA multiplayer where you can choose cops insted of gangsters xD wepons could be better!

10510	0	a	I used to love this game, I played it everyday with my clan but then came the update that ruined the game. They turned the game into pay to win and then I just gave up on the game because you would have to spend hundreds of $ or Â£ or whatever your currency is just to have more fun in the game and when you bought the upgrades, most of them were terrible.

3700	1	a	This review is a little bit long but here we go, Actually its more a getting-it-off-the-chest review than a real review  Once upon a time, there was a company called 'Hoplon' they decided to bring the game to Brazil, so they made a deal with gamefirst, you guys block every Brazilian IP from your servers, and we will force all Brazilians to play in ours(if they want to play). So we had to do so, We played on their servers(However, I really wanted to play on gamefirst's servers, 'cause hoplon wouldn't put new weapons and stuff in the game, they just would use same models and then give them new names and say 'new guns, give us money, I mean 'buy them'') we spent a lot of money on the game. We used to have awesome accounts, with a lot of gears and guns and whatnot. Then they decided to end the contract. And the great bomb was dropped, all Brazilians are allowed to play on gamefirst's severs, forced actually. But they haven't immigrated our accounts to gamefirsts yet So we are totally obligated to start from the zero, while there are already a myriad of gamers in their servers with top accounts. Which means our money and time on our real accounts were completely wasted up until now.  If they ever ever immigrate our accounts, I'll edit this review  They've immigrated the accounts,then it's working perfectly
7030	0	a	I played this game  something that I Don't like it at all is Ping of the Servers it's too high and I've got so many lags 1.5 sec Dlay in Commands not good! I couldn't play any more
6244	0	a	I have put many hours into this game, and it is extremely fun. However just like Blacklight: Retribution, very pay to win and lots of hackers. I still love this game, however you will probably not.
1865	1	a	Multiplayer Cops and Robbers styled game.  Whether you be a Enforcer of the City Security Act or a Criminal out causing havok, this game is quite good if you're into Team Deathmatch and 'Capture the Flag' style games.   You have the ability to customize your character and your vehicle which can drive around one of the many districts available with players always on. From there you can accept missions and be placed against other players or even go solo.  The game is different from most team servers, where games set you up with people you don't know, randomly, etc. APB is different, it encourages you to make a team even providing in-game voice chat.  The only cons about the game I have is it quite laggy at times (at least for me), due to the fact the servers are not Austrlian based. The lag is hardly noticable unless you're in a vehicle due to the poor response times it has. Another thing is the hackers which are on the game and you have to purchase premium which gets you points quicker.
10904	1	a	This game Is a free to play, quick downloading (like im talking in 2 minutes haha) and its multiplayer.The best thing I enjoy about it is that its so simple and runs so smooth you dont want to stop playing, so yes I would get this game if you have not played it yet.
3925	0	a	If you're going to play this, you're going to have a baaad time.  If you do pay with real money though you can go really well! If you go Enforcer you're going to win 90% of the time :D  And hey, maybe you won't rage at how unfair and unbalanced the whole damn game is you MAY get a little kick out of it.
2958	1	a	If your waiting for GTA V to come out for the PC like me, this is a fun game to pass time in (assuming you don't want to play GTA IV, of course...)
6835	0	a	this game is not working for me at all
8306	0	a	I enjoyed this game when I first loaded it. It has great graphics. Great controls. Takes a bit of time to get used to, but once you do, it is great fun. The problem is the community. And this is not a one player game, so you are forced to play 'with the community'. The community in question is horrible. They kill their own team members. Evidently, you aren't supposed to go for objectives until the enemy is right there. Never heard of such a thing. And if you do, your own teammates kill you. Which I can get over. No biggie. But they are RUDE. From their mouths, to how they treat one another. Disgusting behavior. And after I saw the garbage that was in the game, and was treated like crap, I became the garbage which I regret, and went to their level. So although the game itself is fun, the community certainly isn't. And since you have no choice but to play with the community, as it's not a 1 player game, you are stuck, and this makes this game not recommendable.
9017	1	a	Interesting MMO game produced by GamerFirst Live, this game is really interesting and functionable there are many things that i havent seen yet but some games have the same capability to have same functions.. this game is really based off Fallout: 3 / Fallout: New Vegas.. I have played this game up to 37 level, and also with my other character up to 17.. i started to play this game 2011 so i have experience in this game so yeah i guess il be rating this game 5/5.  Warm Regards, MikeN
5033	0	a	Pay to win. Ekh... Sure it's fun-- but completing missions is a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ with fighting all of the people who spent money on the game.
8076	0	a	The one thing I can say about this game, is that if youve played GTA at all online, you wont want to play this game. there are way too many fetures in this game that just do not work at all. That being said, even as a stand alone with no history of ever playing GTA this game sucks.
2121	1	a	Played it and I really enjoy playing it with friends, however I wish there was more to do.
3359	1	a	I would not recommend this game to anyone... Why can't I stop playing it? Somebody help me. (Play this game with me)
3764	0	a	To make this short: I played this a few years ago, and had a blast. Elistist were few and in between, Game mechanics were nice, Customization was awesome. I tried picking it up again, hell, put 20 more hours into it, but I can't get past the Huge, absolutely Huge elitist base it has now. As a silver, it would make sense to be on a server that is meant for silvers (A silver server) and fight people at roughly my skill level, as that's how the rating system goes. However, Max Rank (255, I'm 96, takes about an 2-3 hours a rank) Gold players with over 2000 hours of playtime are your only constant enemies. They claim that they can't fill their own servers so they play on our silver, when they have a gold server dedicated to them, but In truth they just want to waste their lives away absolutely stomping anyone trying to enter the fanbase of this game. The greatest curse is not the pernament weapon p2win, but it's the community devouring itself with inbalance of skill.   If you knew you would lose absolutely every single game, why would you bother staying in the game? That's this games motto. The Golds act like Jerks to everyone, with heavy elitist attitudes, and are unstoppable because they have 1000% (literally) more game time then you do. There's no reason to play or join into the game because you can not win no matter what you do. On top of that, They complain because the fanbase is dwindling in numbers (about 100-200 people on at once, which is very small,) and in that, they justify their mad stomping out of weaker, much less experienced players. This game deserves to be condemned and shut down because of it's terrible Elistist structure. 
5602	0	a	One day, i am looking around in the Freeplay section of Steam, trying to find a good game me and my brother can play, at the moment, i have a 2008 high-end gaming PC, and my brother has a 2014 Hasee Gaming laptop. I am outstanded, the trailer makes the game look brilliant, the graphics are amazing, the customization is crazy! It's like the best fruit-smoothie ever. Insane cars, crazy firefights, i thought i'd just struck gold! I rush to the download button.  *SOME TIME LATER*  The game is still installing, i rush over to my brothers PC, and i love the look of the game already!  *15 MINUTES LATER*  dx11.dll was not found. It says in the requirements, dx 9 is required to play it, as a minimum.  â¥â¥â¥â¥ this.  
1706	1	a	It was fun
831	1	a	Best 3rd person shooter out there , and it's free! 
4172	0	a	This game use to be awesome during the open beta. Now its full of cheaters and Pay to Win items that makes Free Players almost impossible to win. I feel sorry for anyone that continues playing this game since your wasting time and possibly money. Yeah the game has its moments like the customization of cars, clothing and players. The engine is Unreal 3 and it runs O.K. but it still lags and freezes with the occasional FPS drops that come out of no where. I'm just dissappointed in a very shady business model of a game that resembles GTA.
7855	0	a	Waste of time
7421	0	a	i use to think this was alright, but now i cant even load up the game
3775	0	a	Well, it was so nice to start this game at the beginning couple of years ago (I don't play on steam, i just prefer to play from GamersFirst launcher. I've got over 400 hours on APB.), It was, really. A lot of helpful players that can make you really happy. I had a pretty good clan when i started. I was having so much fun. They were really making a game that worths every single hour in the game. For a year I wasn't able to play the game. For a year i waited to play this game again and after some time I went back to game. A LOT of stuff changed for me. The new threat system, new fight clubs map, bounties, a lot of new weapons, new cars... At first I really liked it again. But after some time i realised that if you don't give tons of money to game to play properly, you can't have fun with this game..   Bad things after the change: -Good palyers have become â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s, (I've spent enough time to understand who is good and bad. There is no such thing as good (by good i'm trying to say helpful) player anymore...) -The currency of the game is not apb dollars, it's just the real money itself (So sad to think that i have donated over $50 to this game..) -The developers are just greedy people, (They make a weapon that you can only buy with real money in every patch...) -The potential of the game is just perfect but they really ruined it over the last year.. -Oh, I forgot the terrible matchmaking system. If you don't get rekt (i couldn't even say wrecked, it's THAT bad.) by couple of guys with the best weapons and with the highest ranks, you are one lucky guy..  Good thing i can still say: -One word: Customization. It's like you are playing The Sims with guns! It's awesome to create yourselves that you want to be deep down in your heart. -Graphics are not important most of the time, but i have to say this game was one of the best visual game of his time. They are still good but there is a collection of 'Next Gen Games' now. But still, i really like the visuals of the game.  There are still things that i can tell (Most of them are negative), but at the first sight you can see these ones. My overall rating to this game is 4.5-5/10, BUT if the developers ever listen to our complains to the game just once, this game can go up to 10 out of 10 by arranging APB to a free game(It's not just that, by polishing the bugs, removing the half of the population of the game(I'm talking about cheaters of course...etc.), even it's close to impossible. If they do that my feelings can get back the way it used to be.
5344	0	a	This game is terrible and get worse by the day. After firing the dev team and promising to be better, Publisher GamerFirst took a few steps backwards. The servers promised never arrived. Server downtimes increased and all the way around, worst communit ever. Good luck and God have mercy on your sould you choose to play this game.
2311	1	a	Great game i would recommend to anyone
8399	0	a	I have over 3000 hours of gameplay in this and I can surely 'Not recommend' this â¥â¥â¥â¥. It's unfair unless you are living next to the server with a macro mouse. The devs of this game are dumb and they don't care about server freezing and latency issues.
2337	1	a	its cool
8110	0	a	Laggy, kicks you off of your server up to 15 times an hour, waste of space unless you have a VERY fast computer.
3531	1	a	Okay this is a reliably good game that will keep you going for lots of time AND ITS FREE get now 11/10
10621	0	a	I wish I could recomend this... I use to play this all the time. In it's prime it was one of the best games on steam. Over the years though the playerbase has died and the devs have become greedy. I wowld recomend it in it's prime but not at the state it's in now.
3427	1	a	I've had a case of hemeroids that was more fun than this game.
10646	1	a	This game ruined my life.
6465	0	a	Interesting idea with a nice enough looking world with action packed missions. Actual gameplay is just garbage. Horrible. Cheaters everywhere, unbearable. Not fun at all, die all of time be a hacker *yay!*
818	1	a	this is awesome
10793	1	a	RotMG is a very unique MMO. It manages to combine teamwork, bullet hell, and dungeon crawling in one neat package. Hope right in and watch as you quickly level up and gain power, then suddenly be killed and lose it all, then hop in again and get it all back! Server strain is a big issue, but as long as they aren't full you should be able to manage. Maxing out your class of choice is quite a challenge, and should keep you entertained for quite a while. The aforemented Mad God is also quite satisfying when you do get to attack it. The hilarity of watching a whole server scramble through his punishing dungeon is very memorable indeed.  If I had to say what this games biggest flaw is, it would be the turn towards pay-2-win it has taken. This unfortuantely was not always a problem; realm gold (the game's premium currency) used to just be good for buying cosmetic dyes and pets, or extra storage space. Now, with all sorts of high-tier gear being offered for it, the game feels more hollow and less rewarding. The adventure is still there, but it seems redundant when you can bypass it with the wave of a credit card. This is what personally keeps me from getting back into the game (along with technical difficulties with connecting to my Kongregate account), but if you're fine with it, don't let me stop you! It's still a wonderful game, and i'd recommend at least giving it a shot. It's free, after all; what have you got to lose?
9489	0	a	it glitches at the start for me please fix this 
5721	0	a	i just dont have so much to say...never installing and its bad,its just bad
2453	1	a	It wont start when i open the game it says the game is down for a maintrance. I have no â¥â¥â¥â¥ing clue what so ever how to fix it. this is to Gamersfirst. so i have nothing to say about this game, hope you guys like it B cus i cant...
10091	0	a	The pictures posted are a complete lie the games so â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up u require a seizure to understand whats going on and if thats not enough as i finished punching my face the â¥â¥â¥â¥ wouldnt delete properly so now i feel like ive picked up what was suposed to be a good time and been left with AIDS thanks alot
7282	0	a	Game's horrible. Full of lags, errors and so on. Cheaters are everywhere. This game only got worse after being bought by GF. New company only focuses on getting cash. NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL.
3657	1	a	It`s ok to play, i like it
2335	1	a	this online game is fun and there is always something to do like if your and police officer you chase down criminals and if your a criminal you steal,kill,destroy etc... could be better in graphics but apart from that its a fun game to play. If i had to rate this game out of 10 i would give it a 8
4472	0	a	It's a terrible game the trailers are all lies some guns are too OP and the strategy to this game is to attack and run away there is no way i could take enjoyment out of this game mainly because its a big â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥-canoe and it...Just sucks stay away from this
3426	1	a	Its fun. You shouldn't expect very good graphics nor very good car control. The mission system is fun though its not perfect - still some things to improve. Also this finally gets its engine update. But well.  Been playing this for 800+ hours and over a long time period. Paused once but then came back. Also spent lots of money in it. Shortly before the engine update it finally happens, I get banned for some reason, haven't been told a reason why when contacting the support either. Sorry but that is bull_sh.it. If I get banned for whatever reason, it should be my right to at least know what I have done wrong. Besides that, the game is fine and fun and eats your time. But you shouldn't expect a graphical marvel.
3837	0	a	The real winners in life are those who bought this game for 50 â¬ some years back. Congrats!
2244	1	a	Lags So much you would want to rip your own eyeballs out and jump of a clif  A lot of scammers   Devs are a$$holes  Sick a$$ seasonal events   Has a grenade launcher that fires snowballs  1000/10 would get addicted again
8421	0	a	Pay to win
5765	0	a	First of all, this game isn't free to play, though if you do play it like it is, you will be very disappointed, because you'll be overpowered by almost every player out there in the game who either has too much money on his hands to splurge on a game or has no life and has been playing it 24/7 for the past 5 years, because that's the amount of time you need to put in the game in order to be on the same level as rich players and actually somewhat enjoy the game, so it's more like Free to Play Like a Noob Unless You Pay Up, One point to note is that the mechanics of the game is subpar. Graphics is average. Gameplay is so repetitive it hurts and is unbalanced to boot.  The pros of the game would be rich customization, but you can't fully enjoy it for the aforementioned reasons.   The conclusion is that the game was made for simply making money and the complete disregard for the community makes it virtually unbearable, so If you're a masochist or dumb enough to pony up the devs or take part in their little schemes for earning the G1C, this game is for you.
8011	0	a	The video is nothing like the gameplay witch I hate games like that and I think the basic idead of this game was to copy gta and if thats it F u cause gta is way better than this peice of â¥â¥â¥â¥!
7384	0	a	Horrible game didn't even install correctly. It wanted me to install physx which i did then it told me to restart my computer which i also did and it still didn't work. I uninstalled it and will never even touch this game with a 10 foot pole.
1156	1	a	This game is cool =) I spend 400e for G1C and destroyed 4 keyboards =)
7156	0	a	DO NOT INSTALL THIS GAME!
8681	0	a	steaming pile of abusive â¥â¥â¥â¥ i keep returning to  
9049	0	a	Got bored quickly, crashed a lot, the game felt dull, broken and not worth the time spent looking at it...  Now, 4 years later, it's still where I left it... So I will leave it to die in peace.
728	1	a	I really liked this game, there is some problems with hackers but it looks like they get banned often. Combat is a little off balance but overall this is a great game.

4577	0	a	I have played this game for little over a year now, with over 660 hours played and over Â£200 spend on ingame-items.   The game is fun when you first start. It is much like GTA but with factions added in. The gameplay can be very broken at times, and the server performance is very poor for EU servers. US servers are much better due to them having their hardware upgraded, so if you can, play on Joker (NA EAST) as it is the most stable server.   The community that resides around this game is like non-other. They will complain about anything and everything, but with good reason. It is only recently, that the game has made any progress in terms of quality of game-play, as the anti-cheat software was updated. The game went from using the free version of Punk Buster, to using Fair-fight, which saw a mass ban of cheaters for a short while. Due to the nature of this game, most cheaters will just create a new account and carry on the way they were. Major content updates are very rare, most updates are re-skinned guns, or clothing/car packs. Many features that we have been promised, such as a kill counter for events, are still yet to show their faces.  The support that is offered for transactions and other issues is not useful at all. It is dealt with by only 2-3 people, who will give you the same automated answer, even if it is not relevant to the ticket that you have made. The rest of the staff that you will com across throughout the game are all generally very pleasant people and good at what they do. Some of them are not so good, and often do controversial things which caused drama within the community, the latest of which is about many of the top tier NA players being accused of hacking and banned hacking, or trash talking on the in-game VOIP software (Trash talking on VOIP is encouraged by in-game tips on loading screens).  In conclusion, if you want a semi-broken game to play with friends and dont have money to buy GTA, play this, but DO NOT spend any money on the game, otherwise you will end up like me (Â£200 out of pocket). 
2100	1	a	THE GOOD GAME
6452	0	a	Micro transactions, toxic community, hackers, bad matchmaking, horrible gameplay, and $30 for a permanent secondary? what's not to like?     God this game could be so much better if the devs weren't 100% focussed on microtransactions. And if it didn't have a toxic community, and didn't have a disgusting engine.
10458	0	a	Encouraged by friend to try it out I installed Fallen Earth and I was prepared for some fun. Sure, this game is kind of fun - there is so much to do, plenty of quest, etc. but for some reason it didn't made me stay for longer than few hours. Maybe it's because I prefer MMO games in fantasy setting than post apocalyptic. Maybe one day I will be back and give it another chance but for now I say nope. It's free to play game so go ahead and try it yourself, maybe you spend more time playing Fallen Earth than I did.
2592	1	a	APB reloaded is an action packed game. It is full of suprises and is so random it's kind of funny.
3566	1	a	A lot of people overlooked this game in the beginning. It's free to play now, although you can spend a little cash to get some more customization. This is downright devilish in how fun it is to play together. Get it now! Lets play!

10894	1	a	Permadeath game warning! If you die, you have to start over with the lowest equipment and at level 1.  Realm of the Mad God is a game of skill, if you can't develop the skills to play this, you may not enjoy this game.  With all that said, RotMG is one of the most addicting games I have ever played. It is simple yet elegant in design. Start on the beach and work your way towards the center of Oryx's realm where the strongest monsters dwell. Along the way you will face a constant stream of monsters, all of whom are intent on turning you into their next meal. There are quests of varying difficulty, some you can solo but others you may need to gang up on with your fellow adventurers.  The combat is point-and-click. You aim and fire with your mouse, use spacebar for your special ability and you move with WADSQ. There are 14 classes to choose from, each with it's own special ability and stat cap.  You start at level 1, and can reach level 20 in a short amount of time. Then the game really begins. The gods in godlands have a chance of dropping potions which can raise one of your stats by 1 point. The goal here is to max your stats to increase your damage output, defenses and regeneration ability. The stat potions not found in the godlands can be found in dungeons dropped by the gods or by some of the quest events. There are 8 stats in all, which you can potentially max.  Equipment can be found everywhere. From the lowlands to the godlands you will find gear of increasing strength. Delving into the dungeons, you will find even more powerful equpment. Equipment, Skill and stats are the 3 most important things when playing this game.  Once certain requirements are met, Oryx(the antagonist in this game) will seal the Realm and summon all players to his castle in order to wipe you out once and for all. Will he succeed? That's up to you.  When you first play this game, you will have 7 days to buy into a very good deal. +2 character slots and +3 vault chests, as well as 2600 gold(+5 chests is recommended) and a penguin pet. It is recommended that you use a spare email address to make a test account directly on the website  realmofthemadgod.com  (not on steam), to see if you like the game. If you like it, either continue to play through the website or make a Steam account. Having multiple character slots and vault chests available really helps because of the permadeath nature of this game. You can stock up spare equipment and stat pots in the chests and you can play multiple classes when you have more character slots. They have sales on character slots and vault chests relatively often, and those are the only things you'd want to spend money on..everything else is a waste because it is either consumable or will die with your character(backpacks are worth getting even though they die with you). Don't bother with the Steam DLC pack, it's not worth it.  I play this game almost exclusively(through the website). It's a lot of fun and is a near-continuous adrenaline rush. I'll reiterate, this is a game of skill and is not for everyone. Be sure to try it before investing your time and money into it.
6676	0	a	worst game i have played in along time, it may be free to play but the driving control is just well â¥â¥â¥â¥ and the game is PAY TO WIN 100% im not saying this because im a noob or whatever but the fact that you cant kill anyone your own level or below or hell even higher with standed weapons, you simply have to buy better weapons off there store to win

4468	0	a	I have over 2 k hours on my account. Used to play and absolutely love this game. That was back in 2011 and 2012. I've stopped playing the game in 2013 because every patch the fps kept getting lower and lower. Basicly devs started working on engine upgrade to release the game on consoles and because optimisation was incompatible with upgraded engine they removed it. Or so I heard. Now in late 2013 they made a blog post saying that engine upgrade will come in Q1 of 2014 and it will improve the game visually and increase performance too. 2 years later engine upgrade still not released.  I used to get a steady 100 fps with no drops. Last I checked now my fps is 38-70. Usually arround 45-55 (even worse in Waterfront district) and it feels very unsmooth. Also at first the game used to run perfectly fine on 4 gb ram but in 2013 it started needing more ram and on 4 gb ram setups there were freezes and lags. I have upgraded to 8 gb ram. It was a day and night difference performance wise (no freezes) but this did not fix the fps issue. Since the game matchmaking is based on your skill it constatly puts you against similar skill level players. I simply got tired of losing fights even against lower skilled players simply due to the fact that my fps is unsmooth and keeps jumping. Got tired of waiting for an engine upgrade that is never released. Unless you have a i7 oc'ed to 4.5 GHz I do not recommend playing this game. Sure its doable at bronze and silver levels but once you hit gold threat all your fun will go away when you try to kill somebody with 144 fps on his i100 and 1000 gb of ram. Random server-side lag and teleportations do not help either.  Oh and back in 2013 EU1 had ~3000 active players and EU2 had ~1700. Now they merged EU servers together active population is even less of that that EU2 used ot have so the population speaks for itself. Perhaps in 2050 when Half - Life 3 is released and APB Reloaded receives it's engine upgrade I will remove this negative review and start enjoying the game again because right now it's impossible to do so.
4065	0	a	Well, overall recomendations are about right. I just installed this game and played it for a couple of hours. First thing i notice, there is no new player support. You have to guess how everything works.  When u find out how the game works, you can finally start to play.  with 'play' i mean get shot by high ranked ppl, get things whispered at you (not the nice things), stare at the screen while respawning and wondering what the *beep* u installed.  Game looks fun, could be fun if its not for the terrible matchmaking and pay to win what makes the newbie kind of useless.

150	1	a	Very well made has alot of customizations of characters and vehicles i like the game in general but 1 underlieing issue i find is the unbalance of pvp where law enforcement players choose exactly when to start pvp putting the criminal in a state of unplayability because if you occupy your attention on something else the player will 'turn on pvp' at that exact moment and gun you down without you even knowing what is going on. Basically you CANT PVP as a criminal freely against law enfocement players you are under there control all the time. IDK why they dont just make the pvp always on for all players why cant a criminal roll up on a law enforcemrent player and shoot freely? it is very unbalanced game because of it and it forces the criminal player to not be able to enjoy the game at all if a law enforcement player decides to follow them around and make there gameing expierience unenjoyable when the whole point in playing a video game is to have fun its illogical to make a game where a player that chooses 1 side is automatically disatvantaged and has to try to play the game at the 100% control of another random player.

691	1	a	I really, really want to love APB (All Points Bulletin): Reloaded more than I do. Yes, the original APB was riddled with enough cracks and flaws to take it from diamond-in-the-rough to half-eaten-Ring-Pop-that's-shaped-like-a-diamond, but some of its more ambitious ideas were very nearly brilliant. And hey, Reloaded â for the most part â smartly tweaks APB's little problems while leaving its cops-and-robbers core undisturbed. On paper, it sounds like every wannabe grand automobile thief's dream come true. So then, what exactly went wrong?   Above: If only he'd just worn his safety belt  The short answer: A lot of things. First, though, it's essential to point out what went right, because â without a doubt â APB: Reloaded is a more enjoyable experience than its short-lived predecessor. APB's DNA â once a criss-crossing-crashing amalgam of MMO persistence and barely functional riffs on GTA's best ideas â has been straightened into a much finer point. Weapons now do more damage, resulting in faster, more satisfying firefights. Cars, meanwhile, actually possess unique driving models. In other words, no more sports cars that drive like minivans. There's also a teensy bit of weapon-usage-based stat progression to give you something to do beyond amassing a gun collection that'd make even John Woo's bullet-loving doves flee in terror. And then there's a real-money-based in-game store that... well, more on that in a bit.  In a lot of ways, APB fights desperately to be the antidote to modern MMO drudgery â sometimes to a fault. Beyond rudimentary side objectives (things like raiding stores if you're a criminal or returning stolen cars for enforcers), the game is essentially PVE-free. Missions auto-plop you into a group of fellow ne'er-do-wells (or loose cannon cops who don't play by the rules) and assign you objectives â for instance, investigate a vehicle or commit some nice, wholesome arson. The twist, however, is that your enemies aren't trash mob NPCs - they're flesh-and-blood members of the opposing faction. So missions unfold more like objective-based shooter matches, but in a completely open, vehicle-packed urban playground. When APBR works, it really, really works. There's nothing quite like racing neck-and-neck against a sports car full of gangbangers â guns-a-blazing the whole time â toward an objective, crashing and twisting through the air like you've been punted by Godzilla, and then emerging from the wreckage into a hail of gunfire and, er, regular fire. Other MMOs, meanwhile, ask you to collect 20 boar gizzards because, f*** you, don't question it, chore peasant. Better still, similar chaos unfolds all around you, thanks to other groups on similar â though separate â missions. Bullets fly. Cars careen through the streets. Magic happens.   Before long, though, you can't help but see behind the curtain of explosions and car shrapnel, because that's pretty much all there is to it. Mission types are incredibly limited, generally breaking down into âfind and deliver a thing,â âstop the other team from finding and delivering a thing,â and âhold a point for a really long time.â New self-contained âFight Clubâ districts attempt to spice up the rather vanilla proceedings with large-scale team deathmatch and king of the hill battles, but the two currently available maps lend themselves more to haphazard lone wolfery and camping than interesting team tactics.   APBR's city, meanwhile, is utterly lacking in the loving attention to detail of, say, a GTA or the zany outlandishness of a Saints Row. It's just a sprawling sea of gray spotted with shamefully tiny islands of intrigue. So, by and large, APBR devolves into a very simple shooter with very simple modes in a very simple environment. On top of that, the story's basically non-existent. Occasionally, your contracted mission-givers will send you emails, but there's no sense of escalation or progression. It's just an unending tug-of-war between cops and robbers that never actually goes anywhere â a dynamic justifiable only if APBR is secretly set in Purgatory. That general lack of personality becomes all the more disappointing when you start really digging into APBR's absurdly robust character customization suite. Once you've filled out your wardrobe and unlocked a few decal templates, anything's possible. So, of course, we created something that could best be described as the unholy offspring of Batman Beyond and the mopiest, most blue-haired JRPG character you can imagine. At one point, we actually encountered an incredibly authentic Harley Quinn â jester cap and all â and it was love at first sight. Then she shot us in the face. Long story short, APBR's players supply nearly all of its personality. And while that's an interesting idea on paper, it fails to thaw a frozen, unchanging world whose bag of tricks is about as deep as a drought-devoured puddle.   But what about all that free-to-play razzle-dazzle that APB savior GamersFirst can't stop clamoring about? Business models, after all, can make or break MMOs. And while APBR's âArmas Marketplaceâ certainly isn't broken, there are some very worrisome cracks in its armor. For one, the game constantly pestered us about biting a $10 bullet and signing up for a month of Premium access, and it's not hard to see why. Among other things, our piggy bank's valiant sacrifice more than doubled our end-of-mission cash rewards, hugely boosted our faction gains with mission givers, reduced cooldowns, and gave us a 20% discount on all marketplace items. Basically, Premium's the way APBR was meant to be played. Free, by comparison, feels downright sluggish. Then there's the extremely sticky issue of buyable weaponry. Armaments that cost you an arm and a leg aren't necessarily better or worse than those earned by the sweat of your tattooed brow; they're merely different variations on similar ideas. So, ultimately, a kitted out character and someone who upped their arsenal the old fashioned way will be on a roughly even playing field after many hours of play. However, we were able to roll a completely fresh character and immediately buy a fully modded gun that many experienced players swore by. Suddenly, getting matched against fellow low rank players didn't seem so fair. APBR's early goings, then, can be a figurative trial by fire and bees. Because the fire wasn't bad enough.   APBR is a game that suffers from a serious identity crisis. It tries to be both an emergent, skill-based shooter and a full-blown free-to-play MMO, but only succeeds at falling into the abyssal middle ground between the two. Thanks to a number of tiny tweaks and larger additions, Reloaded is definitely a step up from the practically DOA APB that crashed and burned a couple years ago, but the two are still incredibly similar. Fundamental mission structure and variety flaws, unfortunately, stuck around for the ride, and its (improved) simplistic shooting and driving aren't enough to right those wrongs.   It's honestly heartbreaking, because many of the game's ideas teeter on the cusp of being revolutionary. As is, however, All Points Bulletin: Reloaded fires far too many blanks. Free is a tough price to turn down, but the city of San Paro is â at best â a vacation spot. We simply can't recommend an extended stay.
5590	0	a	worst game ever won't launch
6306	0	a	upon joining, you are put in the middle of the game. no tutorials, nothing. i didnt even find out how the missions worked. its shjt
7751	0	a	If you want to have fun then this is the perfect example of a game not to play.
9521	1	a	10/10 needs more bear
8370	0	a	I HOPE THIS GAME CRASHES all it is a pay to win â¥â¥â¥â¥ and thats unfair to people that cant aford it why dont they make 2 servers one for paying people and one for non paying people
10571	0	a	first of all, the cover art LIES. Second all you do i slay bosses and enimies then buy more sh** and it is imposible to get ONE token. emphisise on one, JUST ONE TOKEN. make a update where things are like the box art instead of one faced sprites and make tokens easier to get and maybe i will rate it better + others
1096	1	a	it's a game that exists, isn't that good enough?                                    really you'd only play this for the customization, but that's besides the point
10496	0	a	This game was great! and then Kabam it's gone..
2850	1	a	worth a try, it has mad customisation and the idea is pretty cool
2375	1	a	APB RELOADED is one of the best online multiplayer game i have ever played! This game is manely fun with your freinds but dont let that stop you from getting this game, the game is still fun without friends all im saying is when you are playing with friends on this game you pee yourself in laughter even more than you do on your own playing this game. I like how you can creat and customize your charecter and make yourself look like a complete BADASS, also you can even customize your own car to make just as equally as BADASS as your charecter. You get a choice of being a Emfocer or a crimanal, you can pick diffrent districs and locations to spawn at and also you can even make your own group or join a group. There is so much good things to say about this game but i will just end it with this.......of the few hours i have been playing this game i have fell in love with it i like this game more than anyother game i own or have now. WARNING THIS GAME MAY BECOME ADDICTIVE!
7111	0	a	couldn't even play the game becasue it would never recognize my account and I know I put the password and username in right

10655	1	a	I can make a new review for this game, considering the new owner/host of the game: Deca Games.  They took charge and started working on the game again.   Here's what they've done so far:  1. Spam bots are completely gone, and some of the multi-boxers and hackers are gone. 2. Brought back life into the game by bringing the community together for a big celebration of Month of the Mad God. 3. Gave out free rewards to those active in the community. With Events and such.  Pros:  1. Very rewarding, Challenging dungeons give the better loot. 2. Good community on reddit and mostly in-game too. 3. A Star ranking system based off how many class challenges you've completed by hard earned, long lived characters. 4. DEATHLY addictive. (sorry)  Cons: 1. P2W, buying (gold) will allow you to get some of the best gear. 2. Difficult, hard to get used to dieing. (Even thought its part of the game) 3. Until recently, the game had a bad owner, Game is recovering.  I recommend this game, 7.9/10 :^)
2530	1	a	Great game just like gta and its free what more do you want
1760	1	a	Pros: Great game within it self. Has alot of features that just wants you to keep playing!  Cons: You mite find a hacker or two.
10879	1	a	10/10 computers smashed 
5373	0	a	Get a life and buy GTA 5!
10547	1	a	With so many moving parts to learn and a seemingly infinite breadth of options to explore, diving into any new MMO is a major investment of time and energy. It's exhausting, really, which is why I appreciate a game like the free-to-play Realm of the Mad God. This fantasy-themed, co-operative bullet hell MMORPG is beautifully simple, yet deep enough to keep you chained to your PC for days on end. It takes only a minute or so to get right into the action, and, once you get a taste for running around with a gaggle of your fellow pixelated-warriors raising hell and slaying beasts across the online realm, it's hard to stop.   Like any of the other thousands of players populating the bustling game world, you've been summoned by Oryx the Mad God to serve as dinner for his hungry minions. Of course, you've got other plans. Venturing out beyond the safety of the hub nexus, your mission is to blast beasties, collect loot, grow more powerful, and then stick it to the evil deity. Spraying magic projectiles around the screen while dodging incoming fire from blocky sumo wrestlers, dragons, goblin wizards, and stranger creatures you encounter takes on a classic, arcade-like quality. The straightforwardness is appealing â move, shoot, collect â and when you weave in exploration, obsessive loot hunting, RPG character growth and the camaraderie of smiting evil alongside other adventurers, sessions grow intensely hypnotic. Even if you never survive long enough get reach Oryx's doom lair, there's a ton of fun to be found in collaborating with other players in battle and unlocking cool new classes to play.   Each of Realm of the Mad God's 13 unique character classes are accessed by reaching certain level benchmarks in other classes. Above all, this is what kept me glued to my keyboard playing for hours at a time. You start as a mewling wizard who can fire blasts of magic in any direction, but as you play longer and level-up, you eventually open-up more interesting classes like the necromancer, huntress, mystic, and assassin. Every class has its own set of weapons and items, magic powers, special abilities, and perks. They all play differently, and I got a thrill every time I unlocked a new one to try out. This adds tremendous replay potential too, since unlocking the coolest characters requires you to spend some serious time with each class.   Perma-death layers-on an intense roguelike element to the already zany large-scale bullet hell RPG slugfest unfolding on any given server, and it seriously ups the challenge and risk factor. Getting careless will get you killed and force you to re-start your current character over from level 1. As frustrating as it can be, death is sometimes a welcome opportunity to try out another class, since you can only have one character at a time without using microtransactions to purchase additional slots. But when you're committed to keeping your favorite character alive, the threat of losing all your hard-earned experience and loot gently nudges you into working together with other players and forming impromptu gang of warriors to tackle the tougher swarms of foes as a group.   Realm of the Mad God's streamlined approach to MMO gaming also changes up player interaction in good ways. Since there's no PvP, everyone in the realm is after the same goals â slay, loot, and level-up. As you come across other players, the desire to tag along and pitch in for tougher fights comes intuitively. You share the experienced gained from defeating foes as long as you hit them once, and there's generally plenty of loot to go around. Typing in chat text makes a speech bubble appear over your hero, and communicating in short bursts is effective for concocting plans outside of the heat of battle. When you do find other comrades you want to stick with, you can highlight nearby players and lock their names to your menu bar, allowing you to teleport to their location instantly if you get separated. It's a simple and easy-to-use system that works well.   The realm itself is surprisingly vast, with a diverse landscape that holds more dangerous and inventive foes the further you venture away from your spawn point. Weaker baddies, like scorpions and pirates, populate the sunny beachside. But push through the thick forests, crumbling ruins, and mountains beyond, and you'll find powerful god-like foes capable of slaying low-level adventurers with a single strike. It's these formidable opponents you have to defeat in order to reach Oryx. Thankfully, when you need a break from battle or a quick getaway, tapping the insert key warps you back to the safety of the nexus where you can trade, use fame points or in-game cash to purchase special items, form a guild, and heal-up.   It may be vastly different from its big-league brethren, but this stylish indie MMO has loads of staying power to match its unique concept. Realm of the Mad God&amp;#Array;s accessible arcade-style bullet hell action blends with RPG nerdiness in some truly potent ways, and the lovely pixilated world holds an abundance of adventure that&amp;#Array;s ripe for the taking. Easy to jump into and damn near impossible to quit, this unusual free-to-play MMO hybrid is worth every second of your spare time.
98	1	a	(Note: I have not played this game in many years).  So, this can be a fun game.. The community sucks, but it can be fun at times. I'm just going to put an up-vote on it simply for the good times I had on it (while at the same time trying not to think of the bad times). I could make a really serious, thoughtful review, like usual. I even typed one up and erased it.   You know what, I'll make a somewhat decent review. That sounds nice. So:   Lag: There is a lot of it. Everyone on the server lags, Heck, the server itself lags. Try out the two closest servers to you. I used to play on one server that I thought would be the best for me, but it turned out that the next closest one was better. The difference was barely noticable while playing, but it made all of the difference.  Hackers: Are there any? For the most part, not really. At least when I used to play, there were not.There were a few rare cases, but it was not often. What I noticed when changing from one server to the other is that I lagged just half a second less than other people, letting my hits register like they were supposed to and everything worked normally. Different connections to the server can make a big difference.  Pay to win: This game is really big on paying for weapons with real cash. There are a few guns that simply can't (in my opinion) be beaten that are hard to buy ingame with ingame money. One of these is a sniper rifle that makes it really easy to jump into the air and shoot someone with extreme accuracy. No other gun in the game has this ability. There are ways to get it without paying a dime, however it is difficult to do, and the weapons will probably expire after a while. (Note: while pay-to-win weapons do give people an advantage, skill plays a lot into it. If you take the standard, default rifle, if my memory is correct I believe it was named the STAR, you can usually hold your own. It is reliable close up and at a medium to long distance.)  Note: I have way more hours than steam shows, and I have never put a single penny into this game. It isn't/wasn't necessary.  Creativity/customization: There are tons of different ways to be creative and customize your character. You can make your own symbols, put said symbols on cars, clothes, etc. You can also change the looks/parts of the cars after unlocking the parts. You can even make music/theme songs. If you are a premium player, you are able to do more with the symbol creator, and able to own more things, but you can get by without it.  Matchmaking: From what I remember it kinda sucked. They changed it a few months before I quit playing and tried to match people by rank. Being a higher rank, I found it really difficult to get into a match. There were times when I repeatedly faced the same four or five people over and over. Not sure if they ever fixed this.  Frustration: Expect it.  What else.. what else.. hmmm....  Friends! Yes, definantly play with friends. It makes the game more bearable. Playing by yourself will probably cause you to get burnt out quickly.  Oh, one last thing. It used to be fun to just hang out with friends and horse around. Running eachother over, stunning/shooting eachother, etc., but they added an auto kick feature that kicks you for a bit after a certain number of team kills/stuns or damage. That ruined quite a bit of the fun.    Well, I guess that does it for the Serious-ish review!   So, now to what I really wanted to say:  So, you may already know that police (enforcers) get stun guns, like tazers and bean-bag rifles, to stun and arrest criminals. I got pretty good with those. They are extremely frustrating to the criminals, but that was not why I used them. They were hard to use, risky, and caused me a lot of deaths. People don't stay down forever you know. But eventually I unlocked the crowning jewel of the Non-Leathal weaponry. The Non-Leathal Grenade Launcher. Oh boy, those were the days. Me and a bright orange grenade launcher stunning and arresting anyone and everyone that I could find. Good times. And yes, I was *that* guy, lol.
6756	0	a	Horrible experience. Very bad matchmaking. Graphics reminiscent of 2007. Character interaction with world on par with original CounterStrike game. To reach its extended character and vehicle customization you either have to pay or suffer endless hours of humiliation in missions against much better equipped opponents.
10890	1	a	Dont play this game its horrible 
1266	1	a	its very fun game 
3429	1	a	totally tubular 
2488	1	a	All Points Bulletin has improved drastically from its original launch but isn't necessarily the MMO Grand Theft Auto we've been looking for.
6820	0	a	played a lot b4 but now $$$$ wins. and it aint remoeling, if it does, dat will b great since its kinda old compare to games now
8467	0	a	Gets boring after a while... You have to work for a quite a long time to achive what you wanna have. The only thing I like is that you can really put a lot into making your characters. Kinda like The Sims 4 at that point, but poorer.
2390	1	a	Very good, love the gameplay
7646	0	a	I went into the game thinking most reviews and some posts about hackers, mass aim-bots and how crappy the game play was just irate people who are simply getting beaten badly as is normal on games that require some eye-hand skill.  Well I was wrong, the game is awash is aim-bots and script kiddies and the game has little to no security to even attemtpt to handle them so yo ucan be runnign down the street bunny hopping and get snipped in the head from 3 blocks away by someone you could never see.  So how the community is even worse then the CoD and Modern Warfare Xbox screachers, there most of the time you just find one or two that might be irritating but in this game, almost everyone is goign to be attacking you or think they are some internet 'gangsta' and have the same IQ as roadkill.
686	1	a	Its probably the best game i've ever played , but mainteance of the G1 is a serious issue and ruins it for everyone  However game is still playable and has about 1000-1500 players daily on Citadel (EU server)  I vote yes for game and no for G1
4950	0	a	Tried logging on again after a few months, my character gone and game support is doing nothing to get my character back. Game is also broken, from it's server lags and greedy game developers (approximately $30 for one gun!). The game is pay 2 win, barely any customization for free users. Would not recommend this game!
235	1	a	the game is a fairly well made game, its being updated all the time, which is nice to an to a degree, sometimes you will be in the middle of playing and you will get a warning saying 'server shut down in 10 minutes' its quite annoying, although this is rare, it will happen to you. This is a grinding sort of game it can be really annoying, ive been playing for about six months and im only rank 128, max rank is 255... there is also many hackers in this game, moslty in American servers. (joker) how ever the Hong Kong server is very good about keeping it clean. (han) anyways, hope this helps, want more info? look for my cannel @ XenonGaming or follow me on twitter!!!
386	1	a	Okay, so...I'll admit it right here and now: APB has it's perks. Customizable characters, cars, even creating your own theme song to play for the enemy when they get gunned down. You can steal cars from civilians whether you're a cop or a robber, and you're always wanting to get to the next place as fast as you can. This game does have it's problems, however: Shoddy hacking control means there is going to be a LOT of people using aimbots and 'legit' cheats, so expect to have several unfair matches, and even worse matches where you're against just really good people while your team sucks. There are some even worse balancing issues, with some guns being leagues better than others; but at least you will know which guns those are, since everyone will be using them. If you have patience, and can just look at the fun parts of this game...I heartily recommend you try it out for a little while; it takes some getting used to, but all in all, it's not all that bad of a game, since it's free...
4842	0	a	Hackers. Hackers everywhere.  If you like to f**k up other peoples playing experience then this game is for you! It was really enjoyable to begin with but everything changed when the hacking nation attacked. Selfish community too!
7357	0	a	Game has micro transactions. I get thats its free, but microtransactions are the only way to play the game? Really? 
220	1	a	Good but P2P
177	1	a	i love this game
6859	0	a	Pay to win, pretty cancer.
783	1	a	So after 10 Hours of creating my character, I join a district. After that, I saw that I needed to press K, so I did, and the objectice was close to me, (well thats fantastic) so I grab a car, drive to it and see 3 players in a car shooting directly at me, I tried to dodge, but their car squished me to a wall. I then died. Best game ever. 10/10. Brings a tear to my eye.
97	1	a	Dont let the majority of negative reviews turn you down. I wil admit this game stil need work (performance wise)   But the major problem i see , is that most players dont know what Squad based tactical shooter is. If u join a random group you wil see that almost everybody just rushes to the objective (like its COD) thinking they can do it alone?  But if u sit down, create a team / communicate and play smart its actualy way more fun and u have a good chance of winning.  For this i believe most of the negative reviews are written by them Call of Duty / Leageu of legends players who just arent used to being pacient.   The rushed player wil die a lot and dislike this game. The Pacient player that thinks before he runs in will have more fun and enjoy the game more!   Simply get your friends together before u jump into APB =) Dont be focussed on the *winning* part and its a lot of fun and fierce competition that ive always enjoy sinds the launch of APB.  The only downsides are the Performance isseus's   (ps. only noobs complain about the weapons) 
6625	0	a	This game is more then just pay to win, it's pay to play. Your cash rewards, experience, and so forth are all dramatically reduced if you don't buy their VIP. It's not just that though, they refuse to make any new guns that you can actually unlock in the game. Every new gun is one you have to pay for! Not a single new gun has been released to public aviablilty since the restart of the actual game from APB, All Points Bulletin. If that doesn't make it bad enough, to truely enjoy yourself in the game you need to be a VIP. Why? Better and longer trials for weapons and cars, not to mention the ability to customize yourself and vehicle, emblems, and more to higher extents. The only game worse then this with a worse pay to win system is WarZ now known as 'Infestation Stores.' It is though fun to play once you're a high enough level, hackers are dealt with much easier now because of the anti-hack system known as Fair Fight was installed. There's without a doubt of equalization in weapons, but that equalization is in the ones you pay for. The graphics aren't bad, controls, mechanics, and interest isn't bad at all actually. From climbing ladders to driving off ramps from unfinished highways, civilians actively moving about the map to simply running over criminals or enforcers to catching criminals in acts of crime. There's a lot of innovation, tons of little areas to be found even when you think you know all the maps and secret locations. I can honestly say if it wasn't for the pay to win system this would be without a doubt the greatest game ever made. It's like Grand Theft Auto 4 and Need For Speed: Most Wanted (the original for Xbox 360.) You can steal a civilan car for the lulz of it, or make your own from a fairly wide range of choices and if you decide to dump cash into this game that customization can truely be starstriking. I've never seen a game with more customization options in my life. If this game allowed you to unlock everything over time it'd be an absolute reccommendation, but it not only doesn't try to do this but HEAVILY avoids it. Potential never met.  Did I mention they made it so you have to buy upgrades for your friend and ignore list, or that new content is never given to those who don't pay...?
387	1	a	gut game, i rate 5/7 p2w

5644	0	a	Man reminds me of the old days when you had to blow the cassette to play the game. Instead if charges you money and it won't work. 11/10 too much toxicity.
9296	1	a	i can say the game is overall fun, it has a unique story that somehow after many years makes me pick up the controls again and continue where i left off. it works for all it's subtle game play and it is a fun time all around in my opinion. you have to work for what you want. sometimes it is very time consuming, but once you get your prize it is worth it
4360	0	a	After two days, I have found the community is small and very rude to new players. More of that venomous pvp game mentality and you'll find yourself outgunned almost instantly. If you aren't playing this with friends, don't play it. You simply aren't a match for the team-ups that will come at you. Matchmaking is terrible and you'll always end up fighting someone with hundreds more hours than you.   If you're an old player and you get it, great, have at it. If you didn't play this for a year or years ago, don't start now.  Also, the cash shop is one of the more predatory, taking your weapons away every 10 days and making you re-buy them...unless you want to pay for the gun with about 30+ real dollars....or a car for that much. The prices on items are astronomical.
4908	0	a	I have played this game for a little while and it is one of the best piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ pay to win free to play games in existince you have to run around and get blown up by rpgs every 5 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing seconds very newb freindly just kidding if your a noob quit now if you want to enjoy the game you need to go to the web site give $500 and suck thier â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and you will get the best weapon in the game the rpg this i have no absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥s about becuase it is a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ game the only good part is the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing player customization i literly didnt give a â¥â¥â¥â¥ about grammar writing this â¥â¥â¥â¥ of a â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. 
6507	0	a	Just not my cup of tea.  I can see why players might like a game like this, however I despise multiplayer shooters of this nature. I was made curious by the apparent explorey open-world look of it but it's just a fancy-pants way of dressing up a series of competitive multiplayer maps.
10318	1	a	The poor man's Fallout: New Vegas.   7.2/10
9044	1	a	The only post apocalyptic MMO that I know of, Fallen Earth is unique in the gaming landscape. The game is something like Gamma World meets Mad Max, but also with a Western theme. The game has an indie budget and look but has some enjoyable game play. This is the only game that I know of in which your character can ride a giant mutant chicken as a mount. With more resources, Fallen Earth could gain a larger player base and compete against more prominent MMOs.

52	1	a	I recommend this game. Most of this review comes from Last August, which was when I last put a lot of hours into the game. Recently I've been trying to get back into it. If you want to play with me, I'm looking for people to play with on the Joker NA server. Just started up a new character. Anyways, here's the review:  This game is a lot, and I mean a lot of fun. I'll be completely honest with you, there used to be a lot of server lag, but now it's perfectly optimized. It is so addicting and fun, with so many different customizations option for guns/clothing/vehicles/weapons it's just awesome. I LOVE this game. I'm finally getting back into it after a while.  The things that I dislike: The amount of time it takes to obtain a good amount of money. (it doesn't take that long if you have Premium.) Premium could have... a little more benefits. There seem to be a lot of cheaters. It's somewhat hard to obtain certain vehicles, and atleast on The Joker server, it costs a lot for a good vehicle/mod/weapon/theme song. That's pretty much it.   
9741	1	a	Yes i do reccoment this, i've played it on crappy computer and was laggy but BEASTLY got new pc and playing it and is awesome

3992	0	a	I was once inlove with this game,but now i'm dissapointed  this game started became â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ every patch, hacker everywhere,the game is laggy as â¥â¥â¥â¥. I can't believe i throw into this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. R.I.P APB RELOADED it was fun while it last. If you're ready to get your asskick and kill by hacker with no recoil shooting or 1 hit kill then be my guest go play this game. good luck. My final verdict for this game is 1/10.
4210	0	a	What a horrible game, after installing the game, I waited close to five minutes for it to finally load. Then, with the limited choices available for character creation, alot in list, but not all available; then finally, when ready to start the game, it FREEZES, to the point that it wouldn't even let me shut it down with task manager, wouldn't even let task manager window come up. I actually had to log out of my computer account for the stupid game to let me OUT.
7662	0	a	Aims to be like GTA, but the system doesn't allow for that much freedom, so in order or it to be like GTA, they need to overhaul the whole game, so no, I don't like it.
5238	0	a	0/9 2much mlg players
634	1	a	Ignoring the fact the game is Pay 2 Win, there are you occasional hackers, gold in silver servers, and all that jazz, this is prehaps one of the best games I have ever played. I remember staying up till 5 in the morning playing, either pwning with the starter which is secretly op, or getting rekted by bought guns which should really be nerfed. You should try it out and see if you can put up with the unfair disadvantages I once had to put up with.
6540	0	a	Dont get me wrong this is a fun game. BUT WAY too many hackers on here i still play it but it gets frustraiting when you get killed over and over.

3565	1	a	I'm pretty sure this is some of the most fun I've had with friends in a video game ever. After 1400 hours on my criminal character, countless quittings and returns, and a mind blowing amount of 4â¬ spent, I believe I can finally give an honest review. I started playing back in 2011 and had an amazing new player experience, which included me and my four friends robbing stores to gather money for a personal van. The game was in a way worse state back then, but there was still plenty to enjoy. I don't play on a regular basis anymore, but the good memories still make me visit it every few weeks.  Now, I can see what people are whining about. Not much new free content has been released in the past year. But if you are a new player, there is still plenty to experience, ESPECIALLY with friends. And yes, there are still hackers and bugs, but it seems way better than 5 years ago. The servers seem to have improved significantly, atleast on EU. While the gunplay might not be impressive for most fps players and the driving mechanics aren't on a racing sim level, the character customization and the social aspect are unlike anything I've experienced before. Starting my own clan of around 40 people, sending them all stuff to design their outfits and cars, then rolling around the district trying to approach missions tactiacally... and end up team killing everyone anyway. But looking great while doing it.  It used to be way worse than it is, and it can still be a lot better. If you are like me and are willing to ignore some of the game's flaws and learn the basics, you can be in for a lot of fun. When or if the updated engine rolls out, I recommend every player, old and new alike, to check this game out. Hopefully after that, the devs will start pushing out more new content too, because it would be a shame if such a unique concept went to waste. 
6786	0	a	okay honestly, i really dont like this game, i really only play it for the character graphics, and car graphics. because besides that the gunplay is homestly horrible, guns have horrible accuracy, the gaming commuinty in cancer and the maps are small boring and repitive. but the absolute WORST thing about this game.  is how big the company who made it â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s you out for money. i mean many people will tell you that its not pay to win, and i mean thats kinda true, you get rent guns with in game money, so you odnt ever need to use real money, however if you want to get a gun that you can keep, well then my friend you are going to pay a arm and a nutt for it, because in this cruel world, ONE gun, yes only ONE! will cost you the totaly fair price of 20 EFFING DOLLARS!!! FOR ONE GUN!!! so i mean, pl0x save yourself the time and money and just buy the better version of this game gta V and you will get guns that you can keep for FREE!!
3770	0	a	best customization  worst community

3651	1	a	So awesome couldn't even get it to launch!  11/10
10653	1	a	Great Black Friday shopping simulator. You play as different types of people, all desperatly scrambling to aquire items before someone else does. Occasionally all the players are summoned to a giant Wal-Mart where everone gets together to break down the doors, slaughter all the employees, and track down the manager, Oryx, murder him and try to snatch his belongings.
2514	1	a	Its pretty fun, be wary of it being a bit pay2win.
6975	0	a	This game is like gta 3 on â¥â¥â¥â¥ steroids handles horrible, tutorial is harder than the final Mario boss battle, and the driving engine f*****g sucks this game is sooooo not worth your computer's disk space.

5184	0	a	I wouldn't recommend this game, ever. First of all, the self-claimed free-to-play is worth a big laugh in the face. There will be rental guns, but all of them are too (in-game) expensive. You will have to play like an addict to finally get one sucky ducky gun off the shelf, while those rentals are only around 7 days. Some are 3. You may want to ask if there is any permanent weapon. The answer is yes, but it comes with a price. Big price. The ARMA Marketplace, where people spend real money to get stuff, is a black market. Do you want to spend around 20 bucks for a single permanent but virtual item? If you do, then this game is totally for you. However, getting only one SMG is not enough to survive the gangster world of APB. There are high-tier players who have apparently cashed out on the game, and they'll do anything to put you off with your newly bought SMG. Then, you'll want to spend more money on another weapon. Unfortunately, this is an endless circle. As you buy something, the game will trick you into buying another. Hold on to your wallet, folks. The second problem I have is the gameplay itself. It's not balanced at all. While the bad guys would rob a store any time they want, the cops would have to chase them down if they ever want to get paid. Chasing criminals is the only way cops can make money in the game. I wasn't so surprised to find out that cops were totally outnumbered. The third ugly issue with the game is the players. I'm not saying that these bad eggs are misbehaving kids, but really all they do are bragging about themselves, trolling other players, and generally being rude. Cops are not exceptions. Almost every pro players (a.k.a. money spenders) I see are most of the time intolerable. Oh, not to mention aiming hack, which is the main contributor to fooling you into buying a new weapon. Tips: no weapons nor human skills can beat auto-aim. The only good thing about the game is its customization ability, but barely enough to compensate for the game's cons. All in all, God forbid you play this game.
356	1	a	I am terrible at this game, yet I can't stop playing 8/10 would fight agaisnt rocket spammers again 
566	1	a	I think this game is good time stealer but p2w i would recommend this game :)
3627	1	a	Like i love this game but YOU NEED A GOOD LAPTOP TO PLAY THIS GAME!!!! I like it this game but the sound is echoing like crazy kn my laptop! So if you have a DELL laptop just get a computer or a better laptop!
637	1	a	Awsome game with many unique class sets and an AMAZING collection of clothes,vehicles etc.!!!!!!Game isnt easy but after a bit youll get a hang of it but never give up if you die or lose your valuables.HAVE FUN PLAYING APB Reloaded! -smackr757
1987	1	a	really fun no hackers seen yet besides fix the load atleast then seems to be like aearly acces game *it should be* but really fun just recommend that when you have bounty cops can see were you are like when they call cops i meen 
454	1	a	Great game
3722	1	a	The concept of this game is great, but sadly it's under-developed and underlooked by many people.  A lot of reviews claim that the game is P2W, and while it is true that progression speed is slowed by half when you don't have the bonus premium XP, most of the items that can be found in the ingame store are either purely cosmetic, or reskins/remodels of the weapons that are F2P, sometimes even having inferior stats to those due to the preset mods that come with the cash store models.  An advice to anyone who's considering playing this game though: Do not even think about playing this alone. You'll need to make friends ingame if you really want to enjoy it to the fullest. Playing solo will get old fast, moreso than in other games.
6191	0	a	today this game is pay2win.. y dont need skill anymore in this game y have use moneyz
4309	0	a	Don't get sucked in. It's garbage.
9636	1	a	
246	1	a	This is still one of my favorit games on my Steam library and it is full of fun things to do (aside from the lag). you can customize allmost anything in the game and there is a large amount of guns and cars to use in game. Also there is a back story to the game (no one really reads anyways :/) but I have and it is not that bad, I say this game is a must get for the roll playing shooter type of people that like to customize alot.
3956	0	a	Its really Bad Game !   really bad really bad !
10866	1	a	Real Good
4396	0	a	What is it: APB reloaded is a small open world gta/saintsrow like cops and robbers free to play multiplayer game where you can create your character how ever you like race, gender, and features, and choose to be a cop or criminal with randomized missions to do with friends or random people and crash a van into stores and put all the goodies in the back of the van and sell it all to get money to get weapons, clothes, and cars.  What do i think: APB is a extreme pay to win money grabber after playing this game for a couple of hours i started to notice how repetetive it is once i started playing missions the missions started to repeat threres only like 10 missions i also found it a bit boring going back and forth with the van selling stuff to get money. and also my biggest pet peive with this game is that you cant buy weapons perminantly you are forced to rent weapons for a limited time only. and there are only at least 10 cars in the game i see cars repeat and repeat on the road like 4 of the same cars in paralell parking together.  Pros: - fun (but not for long) - good gameplay and driving handeling  Cons - dull and boring - small open world - no permanent weapons - repeating cars - not alot od missions - pay to win  The vertict: as much as a cool idea APB reloaded is it is a very boring money grabbing repetetive free to play game i am going to give APB reloaded a  RATING: 3/10
5070	0	a	I tried loving it, gave it so many chances but in the end I just cant bring myself to play it anymore
8892	1	a	I enjoyed Fallen Earth, but there is a lot to this game that makes me cringe. The crafting times get ridiculous, you don't get much help from the Help chat (if anything you just get extremely annoyed by the noobs asking how to ride a horse), the GM's act like punks as well as most other players, some enemies might be a little overpowered and may require you to bring friends, which are hard to acquire if you aren't lucky, and I guess you're not allowed to hold a ton of chips on hand...? I dunno, I had red chips in the mail and some on hand, but couldn't collect them. It's been a while since I played, so I don't remember everything, but I think I had to get premium to hold more or something like that.  It's not all that bad, though. It's good for an apocolypse game that comes with good ideas for character builds and such. I like that you can craft pretty much everything you need, but some materials are extremely hard to get, and as I said beore, the crafting times are crazy. FE is basically an apocolyptic World of Warcraft. Obviously not as big, popular, or 'fixed'.  7/10 in my opinion to say the least.
2106	1	a	i wish the game had less standards to be useable like it should have a lower video card option and graphics card but other wise i love it
2078	1	a	After having a lot of problems trying to actually play the game, I finally got to play it! It's great fun, very balanced, and has hours of gameplay!
6497	0	a	This game makes Hitler looks innocent .
6700	0	a	played this game before it was on steam and left cameback after awhile and left for good this time. This game is   HEAVILY   p2w it seems like, you have your 3 districts 2 fighting disctricts and 1 social district and you have fight club maps, the 'rank' system is based off of losing and winning which is dumb because if you go against p2w players you will lose you won't even have a chance the servers are kindaorienated towards your 'rank' you have green servers bronze servers and so on the hackers ruined this game p2w really ruined it not to mention all the lag respawn sometimes seems like it takes forever and fight club matches are extremely hard because of the lag and p2w players all the guns you get with in-game currency go away after a few days so yeah don't waste your time with it. -100/10
4068	0	a	Unbalanced peice of â¥â¥â¥â¥ that provides a poor tutorial that is really buggy to new players and pits NEW PLAYERS AGAINST PLAYERS THAT HAVE BEEN PLAYING THE GAME SINCE IT CAE OUT! It also has weapons that are weak at the start, a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥ interface, and you should just ignore this peice of â¥â¥â¥â¥ and play some tf2.
6283	0	a	TL,DR: Good concept, poor execution  APB Reloaded, what can I say.  At first, it sounded great, an open world comps vs robbers stile game, something different. Lots of customisable options including kill sounds, brilliant.  Then the play started.  It is not friendly towards new players. The tutorial system works for the first three full 'missions' then its kill the most advanced players in the game. The customisation is clunky, time consuming and the customised music requires advanced midi making knowledge.  Players on both teams seem to either hack, or have no lives (or money) as weapons are mostly pay to aquire (and then only for a limited time), or they have aimbots and kill in up to three shots (normally takes around ten).  As an added extra, after the recent update, the game likes to randomally lag and kick people out of the game, disconnecting for unknown reasons.

8806	0	a	I don't recommend this game for a number of reasons  1. Takes a hour and 1/4 of a hour just to set it up and play the damn game  2. Vey laggy, laggiest game I ever played on Steam  and 3. The loading times, are so damn slow!
6677	0	a	This is excatly what pay to win looks like. When Realtime worlds had this game it looked stunning and everyone was excited but once it was picked up by its new developer, everything went down hill. The first thing you'll notice is almost everything has a lease on it and the only way to keep you Weapon, car, etc is to pay real money which is absolutly ridculous. I can understand the developer need to make money off this game but this is not the way to do it.
5774	0	a	A really stupid game with bad graphics, GTA III level bad, and you have to pay to even enjoy this game or else you just respawn... die and repeat  very infuriating, and very stupid people running it, the only good (and bad) thing about it is there is always new guns and stuff that's always better than what came before it, just to keep you buying more and more useless items with your hard earned money...   Oh yea, and don't glitch coz they ban you for that, and they see that it's not their job to fix it, it's your job not to exploit it... lol

It used to be fun, but now it could get shut down and I wouldn't even notice or care.  I hope G1 goes super bankrupt, because regular bankrupt is too good for them.

The community is amazing most people are friendly when i made my character almost immediately was i invited to a clan from then he gave me a more in depth tutorial bought me a horse and some feed . graphics amazing considering its f2p . gameplay good but the crafting is a little confusing but once you figure it out its smooth sailing . overall 9.7/10 not perfect but close fed my thirst for more games like fallout

7008	0	a	If you like waiting extreme periods of time just to play a low graphics game, this is the game for you! When you first log in, you get to what I call the 'black box of death'. (And that after all the 10 other loading screens). Then you'll sit through 24 more loading screens and eventally wait 12 hours to get in a server, only to find that everyone is a total â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ that only kills you.

9864	1	a	Very interesting game.  It makes me feel as if im playing a Fallout Online-ish type game.  The game is pretty old (released in 2011!), but it still shines with the better MMOs wih some decent gameplay. The graphics arent the greatest as well as the UI being a bit on the griany side.  I will say this again: I prefer having solid gameplay over amazing visuals. This game has it in spades.  The map is HUGE, and im only in the first area. i hear there is 3 or 4 maps?  I was a huge fan of the skill system in the edler scrolls games ( the more you do something, the better you get at it, and the better stuff you can make/ use), and am glad its implimented in this game; though its not very clear that you have to buy the skills first off ( in game money ) from trainers. Im pretty sure that is covered in the toutorial, but i blew through that bad boy like i was a seasoned WoW quest grinder /sadface.... yes click yes click yes click  From what a friend who beta tested and played copiuos hours afterwards told me, was, that the character system is much like The Secret World, where you can continually change your skills in and out as you see fit. You're not stuck with one type of weapon or another. You want to use an LMG? Find the skills required, build them up, then equip the gun. Same with armors and everything else you can use.  Oh, and basically this is a crafting MMO. You RARELY if ever get guns dropping off mobs. You build al;most EVERYTHING. See that guy off in the distance on the Harley? Yeah, you can make one eventually. Get ready for some serious time drain though. Each item you craft has a real life time to make. Based on your applicable skills (for the type of crafting you are attempting), you can lower the amount of time it takes to make stuff. Just dont be suprised when you see that the engine you need to make for your sweet ride takes 24 hours to craft. BUT: you can craft and quest at the same time. Thank the gods.  Im very interested in seeing how the Mutant powers work. Yes, mutant powers. Basically spells. And there is quite a few branches of types. some are for damage, some are healing, some are buffs, and others are a good balance in between. I have no experience with them yet, so sorry im no use to you there.  With a little under 5 hours ingame, i would have to rate this at the following:  GRAPHICS: 7/10 not awful, but not anything super polished like the MMOs that have relased in the last few years.  GAMEPLAY: 8/10 Some minor glitches here and there, which shouldnt be since this game is this old...  CONTROLS: ugh... 6/10 Get ready to remap some keys right off the bat. Once you get the WASD set to NORMAL (A &amp; D to turn, not strafe), its easier. But, never forget that Shift isnt Run. the '/' key changes your speed through 3 settings.  SOUND: 9/10 I'm only in the first area, so i havent heard much other than some random screams when mobs die, a few towns people, and some weapons being shot off. What i have heard is great though.  overall i will give this game a standing 8/10. I will update as i play through, though im sure the 'score' i gave it can only go up; based on what ive heard from my buddy who has a maxed out toon.
10428	1	a	nice and long all is good  
5768	0	a	This is a game I wish I could love because who doesn't want to play Cops And Robbers: Online?  Sadly though, the game is absolutely broken by blatant, no apologies pay to win (which is a term I hear thrown around a lot but I have never found as relevant as with APB) policies, a pretty pronounced bias for the criminals, and flat-out meaningless 'matchmaking'.  Let me put it this way: after a one year hiatus, I came back and made a new character. As I was relearning the mechanics and how to play, I queued up for my first match and was pitted against a gold-ranked superhero who had a gun that killed me in two shots, a rocket launcher, and a machine gun for a secondary weapon. Only bother with this game if you have about a hundred bucks of disposable income that you want to spend on the in-game store.
3452	1	a	love this game
9166	1	a	Best free to play out there, tons of stuff to do.  The combat system is simple, but you get what you pay for.
2686	1	a	I know a lot of people who dismissed this game as a GtA knock off or a crappy fps. But some people don't dive to far enough into the game the see what it really is, the world of Chaos and Law. Now before you jump to conlclusions i was sceptical of the game as well at first, but it's one of those things that have what you would call a wind up period where people have to get used to the game and figure out what they have to do. That being said I tried it for a couple hours at a time at the start of my criminal career, but i soon found myself logging in more time over and over and over, until i felt like i got into the swing of things. At that point I had been playing solo but i had convinced a couple of friends to try the game and after i had showed them the ropes we got addicted to what we thought was the best part ...MULTIPLAYER... Multiplayer is what can make or break a game and for this game i say it made it. I highly recommend this game to anyone who might be a little lacking in the $$$ department or is just looking for a game that they can have fun with some friends.  8/10
5627	0	a	my poops look better than this game...
7850	0	a	Wow, it took hours of installing/uninstalling stuff, manual registry cleaning just to get it started. F*ck this mess
8862	0	a	I was part of the beta testing for this game and played it up until the game went free to play and got sold to that third company, Gamers First.  When the game was handed over to that company I lost access to my old account and the characters on it. I followed the instructions to 'merge' my account to their new system and lost access in the process, I contacted them and received no response on the issue.  I tried making another account but found the game was being filled with microtransaction pay to win garbage so I just dumped the game.  The old Devs were actually active within the community, and very helpful.  The new Devs, in my short one sided interaction with them, are complete garbage.  This game had a lot of promise to it but was snuffed out by the new company's greed and lack of customer service.  This game is dead.
602	1	a	There is better ways to hurt yourself than playing this game.
1808	1	a	Fun to play with friends, but there's loads of hackers.

5494	0	a	A complete waste of time. This game is literally the worst MMO to date... This is why Realtime Worlds went out of business and the free version is no different. Don't even download it, because it is full of people who buy guns (with REAL money) and being a new player really takes the fun out of it because people will just snipe you from across the map and have one-hit kill weapons. Stay away from this piece of crap game.

10263	1	a	What is Fallen Earth? Fallen Earth like a MMO Metro 2033 only minus Russians talking in English with silly Reznov voices.
9475	1	a	Fallen Earth is an extremely clever game! It's mechanics are well defined, and thankfully free to play. It follows a traditional MMO pattern, but with it's own defining characteristic. A FPS or thirdps mechanic that works fantastic! Any MMO fan will feel at home here. It's crafting system is amazing, but if you are the kind of person who loves crafting, you might end up spending a lot of game time gathering the materials you need to build in game objects. PVP is good. Unfortunately there was only one game type that was generously populated, the rest having either zero or a handfull of players wanting to play it.   Since it's free, there's nothing wrong with checking it out! Be wery, the game glitched on a ATI Radeon 4300.
671	1	a	Game is good if you like a tongue in your â¥â¥â¥â¥

3753	0	a	I have played this god forsaken for hours, hours, ive spent an ungodly amount of money on this game. Because that is practically the only way to do good in this game. The community of this game is absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t full of awful people. If you are actually good at third person shooters then do not get this game. You will constantly be called a hacker. You will eventually get banned just as i have, and in return lose everything youve worked for. I was max rank with everything unlocked and i payed the price for being accused a hacker. I know sit at home staring at my screen wishing that i could punch the C.E.O of Gamersfirst in the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing face. This Game's Community, and EVERYTHING it stands for is absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥T!

949	1	a	Fun game. Free to play but Buy to win.
6853	0	a	Pay to play garbage. I hope you like renting weapons, because that's all you're going to get to do unless you drop real cash. The combat is third person awkward and boreing.
5998	0	a	dose not work when you push start it dose not start.
10070	1	a	This game was fun but far too slow for me to really get into a lot I gave it a bit of time but the progression was just way too slow for me I felt as if I was playing WoW and the tutorial system was just as bad as WoW's when I tried this game though even with that all being said the game looked great and it showed a lot of promise.   While this type of game isnt for some people myself included I would still recommend it just for the fact that the game itself doesnt feel lieks ome kind of horrible ten minute made on a low budget game. The quality of this game is amazing and the simple fact that its free makes it all that much better I don't understand why so many people have a mixed view of this game but I am sure its in part to the fact that the community wasnt very nice to new players.
10356	1	a	it would be nice to know when you make your account your user name with out having to research it. kind of pointless making you use a username as a password if you dont know it because the game company made one for you and didnt tell you it. learning this was stupid on the game developers part.
8917	1	a	I like this game, but it has many problems people won't simply dismiss. I for one can forgive them but it confuses why these problems exist. Problems like animation, hitboxes, crafting system. They all seem outdated and worse versions of what other games do. The first person animations are monstrous, but the third person animations are alright. The hitboxes can be a bit wierd but bearable. The crafting system is a click, wait, get kind of system, where you get the materials, hit craft, wait a while (5 min to 10 hours depending on the item.) then you go and get it from the menu. Also something that bugged me was that this game came out in 2009 originally and that they had the nerve to put a price on this game before it went free to play. This game is a good free to play but paying for it is a horrible and idiotic idea, simply because the polish in this game is next to nothing. This game does get in depth later on though with factions, vehicle (Better vehicles I should say, since you get a horse ealy on.), and more advanced and better looking weaponry. The quests are interesting and sometimes challenging but luckily I had friends to help me out, this also improved the amount of fun that I had with this game. When you first get in it may look like another hotbar World of Warcraft like game (I actually like WoW it's just that many MMO's borrow so much from it that it gets boring.) but all those keys are 100% option for a more 'magic' oriented player. The tutorial is horrible, boring, and useless aside from simply teaching new players and should be skipped if you have played before. Now onto the better parts of this game. It progression is slow but it feels good to finally get that first revolver after using pellet guns for a while. The custimization in this game is good ingame but in character creation it is limited but acceptable. The towns feel alive due to all the other players going around doing their missions, crafting, learning, etc. Now for a more personal opinion, I found this game alright, it gave me fun times with my friends but sometimes I would get locked getting resources in an area for crafting and trading. I saw myself just joking around a lot before heading out to do a mission, which my friends would have fights over because some would go ahead of each other and it honestly annoyed me. This game also has PvP which I never participated in since I had no real reason to. This game gave me some rewarding progression (Which was created from the effort and time put in), confussion as to why it isn't more polished and improved, and a annoying but sometimes fun time with my friends. If I would have to give this a score it would honestly be a 5/10. I see the appeal here it's just I can't get over why it is like it is now: a messy MMO shooter with mechanics which could be improved easily. I recommend this game to someone who takes MMO's as serious as a mature Arma player.
7714	0	a	I CANT START IT (windows xp) PRESS PLAY LOADING AND THEN NOTHING
3040	1	a	Playing this game til GTA comes almost as good as GTA!
1539	1	a	best part was when i unistalled it
7058	0	a	This game leans on, advertise's, and preys on those who get dragged in to character building. A bunch of Youtube trolls covincing me a broke â¥â¥â¥ game has potential because they were paid to promote the character creation 'the only unbroken part of the game.'   Yet still, you have to pay to unlock a crap ton of designs... unless your spend hard earned hours to get some decent items at the bottom of their list.   Free to play or pay to win... That's the name of this game.   To top it off, there are major glitches in the game that won't allow your gameplay to be satisfying or many times enjoyable at all. Why waste a minute to 100 hours of game play guaranteed not to work properly 70% of the time? My final straw at my final hour of game play, was not getting any credit for one of my best battles in the game. That doesn't sound like a big deal, but when you are trying to earn in game money so you don't have to dish out 100 dollars for items, it really will tick you off.  After this review, you can consider downloading it and find out for yourself... GTA 5 is out, so not really a point in investing on a lesser copycat of the GTA legacy.  Over all, this is my official rating for APB Reloaded:  ....................../Â´Â¯/) ....................,/Â¯../ .................../..../ ............./Â´Â¯/'...'/Â´Â¯Â¯`Â·Â¸ ........../'/.../..../......./Â¨Â¯\ ........('(...Â´...Â´....

10252	0	a	WORST GAME EVER!! It's a piece of crap and poorly deisnged. It probably gets funner at higher levels but it takes forever to get there. it's a waste of space on a computer.
3490	1	a	all i want to say is two things i think this game needs that might have made me play it more than i have  -1 it need a way where people who dont want to pay can earn cars through missions or just have a way that we can have more possible features if we dont pay.  -2the map is small like really small  i might change my mind it depends f the game changes.
4326	0	a	It is bad.
9599	0	a	I played some of this game it was confusing and the intrest did not last long. If u want a wasteland/apcolypse game get fallout or something else.
572	1	a	Not revamped, not rejigged, not redesigned. Reloaded. APBâs new suffix is apt, as this free-to-play reincarnation of 2010âs deflated cops and robbers MMO is a retread of the same ground. The same drab city, the same hollow combat, the same lopsided results. The original city of San Paro has been left standing, a monument to badly judged level design and the colour grey. The first gameâs devs, Realtime Worlds, intended the place to live and breathe. Instead, it spluttered a few times before its life support failed. Its resurrection is a miserable one. Reloadedâs missions usually pit two small squads of human-controlled criminals and enforcers against each other, asking them to perform a multi-stage series of mini-jobs. One team has to drive to a place, collect a thing, and deliver it somewhere else. The other team has to stop them. Occasionally this leads to the kind of scenes that flicker through the minds of non-players when you describe APB to them: high-speed chases through busy streets, lastsecond jumps into getaway cars. Most of APBâs problems remain in Reloaded. It even inherited a few new ones, as it is currently seeded with cheaters. The original game was arguably killed too soon, so the switch to free-to-play means interested parties should at least take a weekend city break back to San Paro. But this is no revitalisation â APB Reloaded is rehash, replication, and repetition.
7254	0	a	I HOPE THIS GAME CRASHES all it is a pay to win â¥â¥â¥â¥ and thats unfair to people that cant aford it why dont they make 2 servers one for paying people and one for non paying people

10017	0	a	too much of a hastle to get a account and i have tried everything so ya they need to simplify it.
5813	0	a	First of all, this game isn't free to play, though if you do play it like it is, you will be very disappointed, because you'll be overpowered by almost every player out there in the game who either has too much money on his hands to splurge on a game or has no life and has been playing it 24/7 for the past 5 years, because that's the amount of time you need to put in the game in order to be on the same level as rich players and actually somewhat enjoy the game, so it's more like Free to Play Like a Noob Unless You Pay Up, One point to note is that the mechanics of the game is subpar. Graphics is average. Gameplay is so repetitive it hurts and is unbalanced to boot.  The pros of the game would be rich customization, but you can't fully enjoy it for the aforementioned reasons.   The conclusion is that the game was made for simply making money and the complete disregard for the community makes it virtually unbearable, so If you're a masochist or dumb enough to pony up the devs or take part in their little schemes for earning the G1C, this game is for you.
1654	1	a	Yeah there may be hacker but what would you expect from anygame of chorse there going be hacker we cant help how other people are but for you hater out there i recommend you get over it because there hacker everywhere even in new games. there alway will be.
4330	0	a	a weird version of gta. not much fun. a lot of annoying pop ups saying: you need new jeans click here to buy new jeans for your character. to buy things you pay with your own money and everything you need to buy so not really good.
1650	1	a	Good, I guess.
9806	0	a	only play this game if you hate yourself!
505	1	a	Majority of their consumer base (the ones that actually pay for stupid crap in this game) were cheaters.  They were all banned. Ha ha. Take that, Reloaded.

6444	0	a	Unless the game gets a major FPS fix its not worth the space
3617	1	a	Entertaning shooting and driving game. Kind of a mmo GTA with lots of cosmetic configurations of the caracter, cars and clothing. The options are how ever mostly cosmetical.  Very hard to get a grip of att the start as there is a extream lack of instructions and information at the beginning. Free to play, but as with most F2P games its more like free to try. You really need to by the premium after a while to get the bonus exp and cach rewards, if you dont progression gets very slow and teadious.
7839	0	a	A horrible pay to win 3rd person shooter
7400	0	a	This game is terrible, when you try to do missions you get killed by people 50 times higer the level you are and they camp at the objectives. This game is not for new players or people who HATE grinding.   -50/10

2896	1	a	This game is like GTA online bt withought the worry that it will be outadated by a new system or a new vertion because it is on the computer you never have to worry about it being replaced by GTA 6 OR 7 because it will never go away and if you get another computer you can just pull it up on it instead of getting a new x-box or ps5
4530	0	a	APB: All Points Bulletin, was my first encounter with this game back in 2010. I first heard about it in 2009 on a podcast I used to listen to weekly and they talked about this game for a little while, what I got out of it was that it was nothing more than a GTA clone with bad car mechanics and ok'ish graphics. So naturarly I didn't give it a second thought until one of my friends who had just gone trough GTA4 and its DLCs on PC started to talk about it just weeks before release and wanted me to join in and get it, I thought why not as the idea behind the game was cool... Well, the idea was cool but the execution was horrible, poorly optimized, lag spikes and a bunch of glitches. I lived trough this mess for around 56 hours of gametime before I quit, then just a couple months later it was announced that the developer and the game itself would close down. Wow, it had not been out for a year even, and they where already closing it down. Though as I can remember so had it cost a stupid amount of money to develop, so I kinda see why. Then a little while later somebody bought the IP and announced that it was going f2p.  Anyways, fast forward to summer of 2011 when the open beta for APB: Reloaded started and I tested it again, this time the game actually played nice, though still not the best when it comes to optimization and server stability but I cranked out around 100 hours before I quit again. Then I tested it again just a few months ago and it was still the same, nothing had changed. Nothing.   Pros
2440	1	a	cool game

4934	0	a	Let me first start off by saying that, since RTW went bankrupt, This game has been going further and further down hill every since it was turned into 'Reloaded'.  The game as it is now, is a disaster. Although it's a free to play game, there is probably 80% of the population that are cheating, It's a typical G1 Game and i wouldn't recommend it, even though it's F2P. I've played this game since it was in Closed Beta with RTW, and if it had of stayed dead after RTW, it atleast would of been a good memory.  Gameplay - 3/10 - It used to be much better, but now it's horrible.  Community - 2/10 - 80% of the players if not more, are cheating, and will try to grief/troll you because they think they are good.  Development - 1/10 - G1 Do not know what the word Development is, The game has pretty much everything RTW had, and whatever RTW Didn't have out already, G1 Just used the ideas RTW were going to implement and released that as their own work. The only thing that gets updated on a regular basis is the Cash shop.  Anti Cheat - 1/10 - The anti cheat is a joke, and it's even got to the point where some blatant cheaters that were caught and banned, have been unbanned via the GM's/Devs of the game because they 'know' them.  Overall Score - 1.75/10 is the average of all those scores put together, However i am actually givine it an  Overall score of - 0/10 - Because i think it should of just stayed dead and remained a good memory rather than it being torn to shreds with G1.  Recommendation - Although it's a F2P game i would stronlgy recommend you DO NOT try this game, If you want to, then do it, afterall it is F2P. But don't say i didn't warn you.
7185	0	a	the game won't launch despite i already update my Nvidia PhysX to the latest version
5095	0	a	The game would be fun if i didnt get destroyed everytime i joined a match/mission because everyone is decked out in strong gear and demolishes me as someone with almost no gear because i just started the game.
8623	0	a	game sucks don't download
5433	0	a	another game where the launcher has fallen to â¥â¥â¥â¥. 10/10 if it whould let me launch it aagain.
1807	1	a	Very addicting, even if it's a bit repetitive. Admittedly it's hard to progress without premium once you get to a certain point, and a lot of the premium weapons are overpowered, but not to the point where you NEED them to do well. Admittedly, I haven't played in over a year, so this may have changed.
5027	0	a	i spent 2 hours trying to open this â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game and it still did not work
107	1	a	APB: Reloaded, a game where Pay-to-win is not optional but mandatory. I have some good and bad points that I would like to share with you but first you may notice my hours on the game don't seem like I have much experience. I can assure you that I have been playing APB: Reloaded for over 3 years now.   Anyway, onto the good points, this game has a wide-range of customisation options for pretty much anything from weapons to cars and everything inbetween (Mostly just cars, characters and weapons though). The wide array of customisation is what seperates the GTA (Grand Theft Auto) styled game from others such as APB: Reloaded.  As for the game itself it has a sort of 'unique' fighting style as a shot from a weapon does the same damage to the foot as it would to the head which draws in a much more casual audience who would prefer this fast-paced massive open world of carnage and mayhem. There are all kinds of different weapons in APB; High Velocity, SMG's, Rifles, Stun guns, Pistols, LMG's and even High Explosive weapons featuring the OSMAW (RPG type weapon) and OPGL (Grenade Launcher). This open-world environment is ideal for the casual gamer who's looking to get a 'thrill' in playing something like GTA, just without the cost.  Anyway, this game can't be all good and fun. As mentioned in my first paragraph, the developers rely a lot more on the money in their pockets rather then upgrading the game a lot faster. APB: Reloaded is heavily pay-to-win which in the end forces you to hand over your money to get something a lot more powerful in-game.   With my personal experiences in APB, they have probably one of the worst Anti-Cheat systems around, also known as punkbuster. Random kicks on innocent players and one of the slowest anti-cheat detectors allows hackers to walk right into the game and play as they would a normal player.  This is where I end, I could go on and on about the bad things that happen in this game but I would prefer for you to try it out, and just a quick warning. It can get highly addictive, incredibly fast.
1670	1	a	This game is a hit or miss for some people. There are so many problems you will want to scream but the one thing that keeps me so hooked is how unique this game is. It's not like an MMO where I can just quit and pick up another with some minor differences and a setting chance. The gameplay is one of a kind and I wish someone would create a better game with the same concept and gameplay but this is all we have so I reccomend trying it out for yourself and decide yourself by playing the game instead of deciding by reading negative reviews.
4710	0	a	To be perfectly frank, I can't think of one fun aspect in this game. There's barely any content, almost noone is online in my timezone(most likely caters to another country), and I could almost imedietly tell this is a pay-to-win.
4522	0	a	This game is Dumbed-down GTA/SaintsRow.Hackers heaven.
8438	0	a	Just a load of horse â¥â¥â¥â¥
8584	0	a	love the game but all the hacks in this game, it's just â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. and it sucks how there are no npcs to even fight either. it's strict always pvp fighting but I'd love there to be PvE fighting in the game also.
2157	1	a	Great game, and its free to play. I recommend this game for everyone who enjoys playing action games.
1464	1	a	I chased the Pink Nixon and found he was indeed a crook.

3497	1	a	Not enough â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
9361	0	a	The game is full of problems,and problems cant be solved by ignoring them.
7003	0	a	I managed to get a few hours playing this game, and what I found out to my content, was very sad. This game was very fun in the beggining, it had nice graphics, the game play was fun, and I thought it was going to be a very fun and good game. A few more hours of gaming and I learned that the only way to actually get anything is with real money, THIS IS A PAY-TO-WIN GAME, what pay-to-win generally means is that the only way to get stuff or be good in the game is to buy stuff with real money. After I kept playing I saw that the community was complete trash, too. As well as the greedy producers of this game. I do not recommend this game for any reason, unless you are willing to spend a lot of money playing the game and googling things because no one is opt to help you.
5601	0	a	Such an odd game... But almost like a sh*tty saints row
7763	0	a	I have issues, the voices in my head don't like this game.
3632	1	a	Good game, but my wallet crying :--(
10819	1	a	good game but many rwt bots.  IGN: KarlPPE
9175	1	a	Sometimes I feel really sad and I just do not know what to do. I typically just go home and strip down to my socks and cradle back in forth in the fetal position. Playing this game has stopped me from doing this, and I am berry grateful. Thanks Shrek.
57	1	a	This game is broken. It's drains your money and your soul. You can expect every person you meet to be a hacker. And no matter how good your rig is, you can expect to barely be able to run it.  But it's 'free to play' and I drove around in a van with hentai painted on the side of it for an hour then got it blown up. So I guess it's pretty cool. 
909	1	a	Truely addictive shooter, loads of fun and great customization ^_^
1491	1	a	Really Good Game 10/10
3929	0	a	This game is just no for now maybe gettin better in the Future...try for yourself you will see D:
5944	0	a	i don't what the point of this game
8296	0	a	  P2W simple as that. Wouldn't recommend it, the game it self is good visually looking but the only fun you'll get out of this is the customization, unless you're going to pay. If not then don't bother, you'll get easily outmatched by the op paid for weapons and super cars the enemies have compared to your very limited options (you don't wanna know how much more access p2p players have compared to you as a f2p). Also the community and car handeling in this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing aweful, just trash.

3680	1	a	  Cool try this
6596	0	a	cheaters/10
3572	1	a	Overall a really nice game. Has a nice character customization. I would compare it to a Saints Row / GTA mix. Great to play with friends and is overall very fun.
10674	1	a	RotMG is an MMORPG where the player is thrown into a wide world where everyone just wants to hurt you. Why? No idea. I was too lazy to read the lore that we have posted on our lovely site of RealmEye. However, the overall game is a great concept, where you slowly get better, pick up items, drink potions to increase your stats, and then.. well.. die. If permadeath games trigger your anger senses this game isn't for you. But, if you love grinding (stats that is) and watching yourself get better slowly over time, then this game is a great choice.  With a new company in place, we are going to be seeing a new era as the game changes to their views. It's a great time to start playing as Month of the Mad God, a celebration of the game's release, is in place.
8020	0	a	I took all the garbage trucks (3 other friends )and drive around the biggest streets just destroying every vehicule I would see. Destroying every minute a person would have...messing with his gaming time...you can't do that anymore as theres no more garbage trucks...
7324	0	a	Doesen't load the Game 
4765	0	a	Still a waste of time. If your a casual player this isnt your game. If your a hardcore player this isnt your game. If your a dumbass cash cow this is your game. Please step right up with your credit card placed tightly between your buttchecks and bend over for MoneyFirst.
7359	0	a	i was playing a hour early and i went to get food i come back on and it sayed i was banned for no reason i did nothing to get this no hack not even â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ player off so how do i get banned for nothing and it is now one hour later gamerfirst i will not get any more of your games
5609	0	a	If you have 2GB RAM and a graphics card below 9400 GT generation then this game wont start
8276	0	a	Pay to win but in its own fashion, its one of those games were u cant tell if u will like it untill u play it allthough i did not like it would i recommend it, no but u may still like it.
3153	1	a	Overall good,graphics are good,even if you lower it,customizations is cool,aiming is a bit weird,driving is very bad,i prefer playing on foot,as for playing mission,well for a new player it's really hard to figure out what to do &amp; where to go...when playing in multiplayer,the cool thing is that it doesn't lag even if your internet is slow...so it's 6/10
10921	1	a	Have Fun with friends for a couple of hours. Nothing more.  Pretty heavy pay2play, I mean a lot of features are only available by spending money on this game. There, I prefer to buy a game once and play.
6083	0	a	The game never starts when I hit start -.-
2156	1	a	This was my favorite game ever, and always will be, even though it absolutely sucks â¥â¥â¥â¥ now. 11/10 IGN
3509	1	a	Good game, just is it just meor is the max quality 144fps?
233	1	a	Very much like GTA, but less realistic
10081	1	a	Great game love the way the item system works as well
6645	0	a	Driving is really bad. When joining servers it takes 20 mins then says disconnecting. 2/10 -iG
9021	1	a	One of the best F2P MMOs i've ever played, i reccomend it. Pros: +Fun to play with friends. +Better PvP because you need to actually aim. +Not P2W Cons: -Not frequently updated -Bugs/ Animations not Completed. 
613	1	a	Here are my thoughts about this game. With the the new engine update coming out the game will now have things open to it that it did not before, with a better engine not only means better graphics but the potentital to expand into something new and refreshing.  The game is good and it's been good to me for a sold 2-3 years now, now I've had my fair share of breaks, trust me. However, there is no other game that can compete with this in terms of customization. That is the sole reason I come back to this game everytime. The customization is so in depth that it makes MMORPG's with their super detailed character creation look like child's play. (Opinion)   Yes there are flaws in the games mechanics that could use some work, but if you look past that and focus on the game itself, it's a great game with lots of potential to grow yet.
2373	1	a	Best online 3PS game by now
5295	0	a	This Game IS free 2 play, trust me :)
4020	0	a	This game has always been a guilty pleasure of mine, however, that alone cannot save it. Although the premise of this game is great, and the customization is extremely in-depth, it simply has too many flaws to make it a good game.    The cash shop, or the 'Armas Marketplace' as it is known ingame, completely ruins any and all balance by releasing ridiculously overpowered weapons. *cough* VAS C2 Troublemaker *cough* The weapon mechanics in APB are EXTREMELY broken. Players using certain submachine guns can snipe players at long distance with ease. Also, there are no scopes worth mentioning on sniper rifles, which makes them worthless beyond 100 metres or so. This lack of sniping mechanics is further confounded with the lack of a head hitbox. This leads to, you guessed it, NO HEADSHOTS! This creates even less of a reason to use weapons besides submachine guns, because where you shoot makes no ABSOLUTELY no difference! Not to mention, the time to kill in this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ly low, you CAN and WILL die in a fraction of a second when a player pops around the corner using a VAS C2. Now that we've talked about the gameplay, we can talk about the community. APB's community is one of the most horrific, hate filled communities I have ever been a part of. Any time I log onto a district, the chat is filled with players endlessly cursing one another out and accusing players of hacking. Which brings me to my next point. Hackers are extremely prevalent in this game, and despite the presence of an 'anticheat' used by Reloaded Productions, it does next to nothing to dam the endless river of hackers flowing into this game. When you're not playing against hackers, APB's horrendous matchmaker will be SURE to match you against players three times your level, armed to the teeth with weapons and armored cars. This shouldn't be a problem, due to the so called 'x threat level' servers. The gold players are supposed to play on the gold servers, the silvers on the silver server, and so on. This however, does not happen. Gold players intentionally drop down to silver or bronze threat level, which allows them to run rampant on bronze servers and completely annhiliate the fresh new players, just leaving the tutorial.   In conclusion, I URGE you to avoid this piece of crap game, unless you're looking for a funny way to waste time, or have a fetish for bad games.
105	1	a	This Game isn't Bad,but to get Some Nice guns you're gonna Have to use the Money From your Pocket :/

1446	1	a	APB Reloaded is a very intriguing game. APB Reloaded is like an open-world game to mess around. It is a cheap version of a GTA type game and can be fun when playing with friends and families.

9634	0	a	So after taking the time to make a cool looking character, I was introduced to the horried controls of this game.  NOT being able to strafe, turn and move backward/forward simultaneously, makes this game completely uninteresting. Which is pretty sad, because the vids and screenshots of this game looked like a lot of fun.  The biggest problem is that I never made it out of the first room you start in. I go to the terminal and it tells me to kill the dude on the right, so I do that and then come back. It then tells me to go and activate some drone terminal or something.  Well there's a terminal there alright, but it doesn't do anything. No button prompting, no hints, no nothing. After walking every where that I could, it dawned on me that I had to activate a terminal to continue. A terminal that is not able to activate.   I give this game an F.  This could be a fun game, ya know, if it were like, playable in some way, and if maybe the devs get their act together.
3687	1	a	dis game very good. i like the part where u build square blocks and mine stuff. 10/10 IGN
9153	0	a	Great concept, bad asthetics and worse mechanics. Extremely dissapointed.
6410	0	a	I played this game back when it came out and it was sold off to another publisher or something like that. I only remember that this game was TERRIBAD and can't believe it resurfaced again like a Zombie with positive reviews. I can't believe it has the BALLS to charge 140$ for this stinking pile. You can get much better games for 10% of the price of this â¥â¥â¥â¥. *coughBorderlands2cough*

PLEASE FIX YOUR GAME. Would higly recomend  4.3/5
4248	0	a	APB Reloaded is terrible, everything is either incomplete or broken. Just like the movie After Earth the amount of advertising made the hype too large for them to handle, they managed to get Tobuscus and Seananners to be in their Live Action trailer, but unlike After Earth, you canât watch it as a comedy, because even though M. Night. Shamadingdong movies are a joke within themselves, games have to be experienced, people have to do things to experience and in a movie you just watch it, in games you have to experience it for yourself.   Letâs start with the glaring issue. Either my crappy computer wonât run APB while recording to do a video review or that this game refuses to let me record on it, bear in mind I play games like Banished and DC Universe Online while recording on this computer so I dunno, but Iâm leaning to APB. Also it has this fun habit of pulling my computer to a screeching halt to only throw me back into the action 5 seconds later 100 game metres ahead of my last non-lag location. Again this is not my computer, DC Universe functions just fine on this laptop, a game bigger and better than this game, so why does this game make me believe every time I try to drive a car, my computer is going to spontaneously combust?   Letâs talk about the driving, now this game is interesting. Most games run the driving controls through the same server, registering at the same time as you would be running right? NOPE! In fact the Driving mechanic is simulated on the servers, and the server controls where your vehicle is located, so when you try to turn the server has to calculate where you will be when you turn, and then it sends back the coordinates and the direction you will be facing. There's normally about a half second of delay but the instant response you get in EVERY OTHER GAME WITH CARS IN THEM EVER, Is really off putting, Youâre not holding the key down to turn because who knows how long the turn will last, you end up tapping it really fast to be more accurate, that is not a good thing, because you have to calculate the speed youâre travelling the catch the turn or youâll hit the wall.  The game back bone is lacking, the cars are broken beyond belief, what about the guns and the character customization. The APB Reloaded character creation screen is the best thing this game has to offer, itâs in depth and you can really show your individuality. This is implemented well, with your Personal Vehicles and Clothing, however you have to go to another server to do all these customization, in hindsight that was a wise thing to do, didnât want players to be constantly spawn killing you while youâre customizing a symbol you put on your shirt or car. Itâs smart but still frustrating when the loading screens are horrific. It only loads to a map where you choose to spawn which then takes you into another shorter loading screen. If you just look at the gameplay trailer announcing APB is going free to play, the graphic have drasicly changed from the video to the game.   This isnât a new thing, for example Dark Souls 2 and Watch_Dogs but this isnât the same game, worse graphics by only a bit, there is a massive UI overhaul, it was like someone downloaded a mod to the game server and decided to mess the UI up as if it was a rage quitter at a board game and smash the crap out of it, itâs a mess. Itâs not user friendly at all. Now when I was younger and stupider, I posted videos on YouTube of me playing this game, and I will admit it has changed, they have added two more areas, basically the same two areas, Financial and Waterfront, but its PVP, so hopefully, more of these battles can happen, but I somehow doubt it.  APB Reloaded is a game, which is torture to play, for some reason people love it, they are all really high level players, they say the game is different when you get past this level, well they said the same about destiny, Iâll never find out if either are true, because of the same reason, while youâre in the small levels, youâre constantly screaming at your screen as all the people which are good at the game kill you in one hit. Itâs a vicious cycle I donât enjoy, thatâs why I giving the symbolic rating of Grand Saintâs Crackdown type of game and numerical rating of 3/10. Also ever since I played this game my computer runs slower, I think this game is virus, I would be surprised from the legend known as EA, âitâs in the gameâ huh? Or is it in the amount of money you can funnel from us? I guess weâll never know.
9043	1	a	If you like crafting then this game has it! Very indepth with a variety of crafting paths to choose from. The game itself maybe alittle dated but a fun time will be had by all.

7033	0	a	The game seemed promising enough at first but when I got in a car I noticed the most peculiar of happenings. The driving lagged...a lot. like when I tried to turn left, it wouldn't turn for like a second or so after I pressed the button, leading to some frustrating driving. This one seemingly insignificant drawback successfully ruined the game for me.   Final Verdict: 2/10
4945	0	a	I don't know, but just on this game I get crashes (0xc000007b). ;/ I have tried many things but no one helps... *sadlife*

5655	0	a	dont really see the point to the game, and dont plan on having too much fun unless you pay. graphics are pretty bad to boot
2712	1	a	This game basically ruined my computer, took me 2 days before it started running back to normal I can play this game at a decent graphic setting but this game is laggy, and very P2W.  Edit: Decided to play again and feels like it has improved pretty decently would recommend. Be warned that this game eats up your RAM.
2366	1	a	this game is really fun i you can make your car make your own chacter you can mug people theres drug missions i mean the game is like saints row dont listen to any body that dosent like it they might be gay im just saying you can have clans gourps and â¥â¥â¥â¥ oh whatever you do dont pic cop its not that fun lol i made my chacter as a old asin guy thats fat and whereing just his underwear lol
6731	0	a	Not a good game. Much cheater, nobody to punish them. Glitch and cheat it's all you have to rememeber, people use auto aim and others glitch with game mecanical ( sit on the roof of a car to cancel a a debuff of speed)  COmmunity is very worst , people insult and just hit your car to make annoy you (its bring nothing just loosing you time)  THere is a mtchmaker in game but unfortunally it's the worst i never saw, you fight againt high level and high skilled people so you can't do nothing and you can't progress becasue oyu die every time.
10558	0	a	Idk Really It Was Confusing When I First Played It And Never Really Touched It Since Then... Ill Replay It And See If Its Any Different
1979	1	a	This is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing nice game! xD
8605	0	a	If you want a spawn and get kiled simulator get this. if you would like to smash windows and steal the same car to get the same â¥â¥â¥â¥ youve stolen to sell over and over again get this. if you want the worst possible community in the world get this game.  This game is like cancer had a baby with hitler then hitlers cancer baby â¥â¥â¥â¥ed stalin  it would be more beneficial to drink bleach you would have a far better experience.   Real review: i played this game for 28 hours, The only time i had fun was the clothing and cars. but after about 11 hours the game got so repetetive all you did was smash windows to get some items put them in your car then drive to some place miles away to sell them. the misions seemed somewhat uninspired it was either kill these people or get this thing to that place. Then the market oooooh the market...you had to smash windows do missions and sell sperm or organs just to buy anyhting off the market now some things are of reasonable price but everything else is just so damn overpriced it cost millions no billions to buy a single gun or car. altogether 28 hours was more than enough to know that i love to hate this game.
4856	0	a	100% pay2win. Its very terrible and has too many confusing menus and just â¥â¥â¥â¥s up your eyes after playing for a couple horus .-.
2028	1	a	its awesome
9293	0	a	Honestly this game took such a â¥â¥â¥â¥load of time to download, I couldn't stand to even play it anymore.  Just playing the intro, there's a lot of controls to memorize and figure out just too switch weapons and equip something.  I wouldn't take this review too personally since I didn't play it as much, but just a warning getting the game.
6878	0	a	It won't even open the game for me!
4246	0	a	Used to be a good game, back in about 2011, in my opinion ofcourse. Stay far far away now. R.I.P APB Reloaded.
7988	0	a	i meet minimum requirements and my graphic card isnt good enough   -11/10
6481	0	a	so last year i wrote a review on this game where i rougly said: gameplay is junk, the people who play it are jerks... it's pay 2 win... it's sloppy, the controls responds slowly and the graphics load slower then a snail could win a god damn marathon.  BUT THE CUSTOMIZATION IS GOOD!  thats everything positive... the clothing and tattoos... if they had this kind of custom items in a game like grand theft auto it would be the BIGGEST GAME EVER... but it dosen't, it's the worst damn â¥â¥â¥â¥ i've tried...  do NOT try it! if you have ever tried playing a first person shooter and someone kills you repeadetly thats only the tip of the iceberg, here you will be kicked off servers by punkbuster because someone SAID you were hacking  i was stupid enough to recommend this only for customisation but i regret this now...  NO! do NOT play this...  I CAN'T WARN YOU ENOUGH! DON'T.... DO IT!!!!
5081	0	a	Before I abandon this game for good let me say it's been quite ride and this is my final no holds barred honest review of this game. Make what you will of this review I am going to try and cover everything I saw good and bad, so you can make up your mind about it yourself but go in informed.   Pro's 1) Customization is great and you can do anything you really like, that to me is the hallmark of this game and it's greatest area it excels in, I myself did design and sell some great Bishada Rapiers when I played but it alone is not enough to keep me playing. But I reccomend it for customization options, and for that I give a 10/10 on the ability to do so.  2) Driving physcis is also nice, you have a variety of cars and how they handle varies by car and how you kit the body. However as someone who appreciates and enjoys racing in games this game has some really good driving physics, they did pretty good so even if they fail elsewhere this does help make up foe something.  3) Fight club is a great addition if your looking for pure action, however this comes with one of the cons that will be made apparent later, so please read further for the con of hackers/cheaters. Thr fight club is fun and challenging and you can getsomething you can use in game out of it if you do the objectives. Joker Tickets are something you can get some good stuff with but you need a lot of them. So for this feature yes I would say it's worth it if you just like combat or need to blow off some setam.  4) The car selection is great and you have a wide variety with many body kits, but these kits are ARMAS only and thus you have to pay in to get them. However there is enough of a variety of makes and models to satisfy anyone, though one shortcoming is a lack of motorcycles which would make for a more interesting experience.  5) The social district makes dealing with everything like customizing, selling, and hanging out with friends easy to do in a nice safe environment. Honestly it's a good idea to have, that way your not getting shot at while checking the market or ARMAS store. It is also the only area where you can go AFK and not time out from the game, so if you gotta go for an hour or two pop yourself there and go afk.  6) Weapon selection (non-ARMAS) is also expansive and covers a variety of weapons, however most of them are 10 day rentals for what you pay but it's worth it at times especially if they have slots you can fill your self with modifications. However there are also some real duds for weapons, and each weapon often is good at one thing but not good at another. However some advice, never discount your normal starter STAR 556 assault rifle. It is one of the best guns even if others would disagree, shiny new gun failing ya use your STAR. So IMO the weapon selection is nice compared to other games, as you can get a variety even if their temporary.  7) Modification system is also a plus, the various modifications allow for your own style of character, so to keep it simple this is a great feature.  Cons  1) The community is one of the most toxic communities in an MMO, when I did missions in bronze dsitricts you'd have silvers and golds playing there stomping everyone below their rank. Then they might say 'Get Rekt Noob' or something nasty and vile for kicks. This game has numerous trolls and A-holes who get their kicks in your misery, bronze districts are where most of the action are at but should be for bronze or lower only. Golds should stay in gold districts, and silvers should stay in silver districts. Also in social district you see a lot of sexual or perverse chat that is just distasteful, so often I ignored chat there. But as for more about this toxic community, I have been insulted and sneered at for even someof my hobbies if they came up in a conversation. A majority of the golds and silvers are elitist A-holes who like to wreck your day for easy wins.  2) Matchmaking/threat system is garbage, and as such makes for some very imbalanced matches that end up with one side having all of the advantages.  3) Small dev team means little gets done or it takes too long to do, therefore things they promised that should be out by now seem a long ways away from ever happening if they happen at all. The two biggest failed promises are the following. - Graphics engine upgrade - Matchmaking/Threat system overhaul  3) Hackers/cheaters are everywhere even with fairfight which JUST flags them and someone at G1 must ban them which happens more with the european servers than north american. If you want to play the frustrating fights against wall hackers, aim botters, trigger botters, and other â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ go ahead. Cheaters are why I mostly stuck to ram raiding and mugging, to be perfectly honest.  4) F2P limitations are horrendous, for example as F2P you can only do like 7 decals on a car compared to 50 for premium players. You can do like 12 or so to clothing comparedto 50 for premium players, and so on and so forth. They really limit one of my pro's with these paywalls on how many decals you can use. This is a great sign of a Freemium game which EA has pulled off with SWTOR, don't get me started on that pile of garbage.  5) ARMAS guns are great if you can afford them, not so great if your facing them and cannot match them. Those pieces of crap can do much more than anything you can get normally in game, unless your skilled with your weapon type anyone using an ARMAS gun will likely wreck your day. So prepare to pay an armand a leg to get oneof these permanently, as inless your paying 2000 to 3000 G1C your just renting them for a limited time.  6) Map layout is a hot mess and each map plays itself to a certain style of play that really limits options, so if you would rather more rooftop battles use Waterfront, run and gun battles use Financial. However the maps are limited in size and some areas that look accessible are invisiwalled off.  7) GamersFirst themselves are a greedy company who only cares about your money, they do not enforce the terms of service so if that enforcer is camping the criminal money laundry and busting and defeating everyone who comes to cash out. Tough luck pal, they can camp the laundry and contacts with no consequences. Players can grief you, harass you, basically be abusive A-holes and they will not discipline players even if reported properly.  8) Graphics are quite dated and we have not recieved the promised graphics engine update yet, so if you prefer better graphics then this game is not for you. In fact they out a buffer memory limit on customization because of how much memory ittakes from the game to show every detail you put into something.  Overall I would not reccomend this game, it is clearly being kept on life support by G1 via ARMAS and the elitist A-holes who keep playing and paying into it. You'd think they would put more money into it, but they do not. I would rather play Defiance than this for an MMO shooter, or for another game check out Triad Wars as it may be more to your style. So goodbye APB, I will not miss you and I have given as blunt a review as I can.
676	1	a	I recomend this Game because it is just an amazing graphical game with lots of missions and many more things it's like GTA 5 but no flying or boating so it's like a free gta you might as well get it because it is a free game that plays amazingly. The driving controlls are w,a,s,d, but you can make do with them and change the settings if you want so I rate the game. 9.5/10 for being free and this good you should get it and play it and be happy.
10140	1	a	i personally love this game. i like the play style the level scystem and a bunch of other things. the only thing is that its hard to get chips in the game. im lvl 17 and all i have is 3 red chips. all in all its a good game. if anyone wants to team up or clan my name in game is Olfbert. also if yuo have an abuundance of chips that your doing nothing with would you send me some XD please. ill love you forever!
4828	0	a	Suckass game it is...
5916	0	a	It was unplayable because it would not load.
10886	1	a	Very fast paced game. It does manage to glitch up at times but that is fine 8/10
10042	0	a	There's a bug that I don't know how to fix: Every time I start the game, all I see is gray, a few textures here and there but pretty much nothing. the textures show up for about a second right when I start the game. Can anybody help?
3163	1	a	This game used to be an ultimate battle of Good vs. Bad. When it first came out, you would log into a world of chaos as criminals and enforcers were shooting, driving, looting, and running everywhere. The experience of logging in and knowing what was awaiting me was a thrill. When it became free to play, I returned to it and had the same excitement going in. Now, it seems the game has begun its decline. You have to be lucky to find a decent amount of people online and when you do they are mostly criminals. It has basically became an online single player game which makes the missions feel very repetitive. Even though this is a negative I have with the game, I personally dont think it's the game's fault. The game is still fun to play, the missions are fun if you have someone to play them with, and the customization of clothing and vehicles in APB is amazing. If you havent played this game before, I strongly suggest giving it a try.
705	1	a	its sick
456	1	a	It's a good FTP game and all, but the devs are â¥â¥â¥â¥ing money â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s.
10651	1	a	Rotmg, is one of my favorite games. Even know there is a LOT of advertisment is still is really addicting and fun. It is really simplistic graphics too which you've probaly heard a lot but guys, girls its a free to play so who cares of course you can buy your way to the top its not really a pay to win because there isnt really any pvp so its more like pay to get the best gear faster because i can get best gear for a charcter in a day. So its not like ridculously hard to get good. just time and effort and youll get there.
10161	0	a	Very meh. Would not play again.
10148	1	a	Love this game, the RPG elements are outstanding. Having third AND first person in an RPG is so fun, being able to fight monsters and such with tons and tons of weapons, too being able to get mounts such as horses and even cars! I recommend this game to everyone looking for an RPG mixed with an FPS. Thanks for the great game!(;
4929	0	a	It sucks.
4678	0	a	****WARNING***** NEVER GIVE THIS COMPANY ANY MONEY!   This company sucks. The game never works. Never has and never will. They only want your money.
8065	0	a	This game has the potential to be good and it try's really hard but its a completely pay to win
8536	0	a	Great visuals, lovely sound system, and nice array of weapons. However, the controls are clunky, the cars slide like they're on ice, and the game is heavily stacked against criminals. you can't even keep any guns beyond the starters for more than 10 days. I give it 4/10
1086	1	a	I think they should implement motorcycles.  - God Bless
1667	1	a	If you consider paying for a cosmetic change that you could do anyway without paying P2W, then this would be P2W. That is not, however, what P2W actually is, and if you consider games that need money to survive as being P2W then you are a truly sad individual and will likely end up poor and alone.
8401	0	a	This game ran like absolute rubbish. And that is all I have to say.
9777	0	a	Fastest uninstall ever! Looks like crap, plays like crap and froze both times i fired it up. Garbage.
5851	0	a	Doesn't work/10  I guess i should say more. well you can't smoke weed, that's not very open. oh and i love pay to win, why did i give this a thumbs down again? well to sum it up, this game is pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥in' mlg
2236	1	a	Best troll simulation. Great game, community makes it hilarious, a couple of weapons can seem very p2w, you will rage if you're easily angered by games, Criminals seem to have the most veteran players, Golds (rank) will trash talk when they beat you and trash talk when they lose (X'D), Everything from your character to your car is EXTREMELY customizable, you can say what you want and create what you want, people will not help you unless you can further their wins, people with rpgs will spam rpgs and then talk â¥â¥â¥â¥ because you died by their rpgs, kids play this (not sure if majority, hard to tell), guys play as girls to get attention and help from veteran players (a method many players now take), as starting out you will most likely get put up against a silver by 60% and golds by 40% depending on time of the day (More golds on at night and in the morning), if you are good at this game you will be called a hacker a lot, nobody in this game plays for fun (but me), game was made by real time worlds (great company) but then game was given to trolls, who bred more trolls and now this game is full of trolls young and old. In all I suggest this game for the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and giggles, but not for a serious gamer. Good luck. Did I mention it's free to pla--- troll?
3000	1	a	Kind of hard to get into the game, but when your in you can have some fun.   Not the best, but not the worst.
10704	1	a	Recently I got my first white bag, with a Lab Coat inside it, conviently I could use it as I was wizard, I warped out, went into godlands and 5 seconds later I died. I wanted to stab someone so badly... I would totally reccomend this game to anyone though as it is extremely fun. It just needs to have less ingame transactions, it ruins the fun.
335	1	a	IF you're willing to deal with the bugs, the lag, and the hackers, THEN this is decent free-to-play version of multiplayer cops and robbers.  Until the servers are upgraded, and the serve-side FPS and other such issues are completely ironed out, it will always be a slightly enjoyable, rage-building experience.
10519	0	a	Hours of grinding , days of farming , weeks of potting , months trying to get the gear and pots , finally got my maxed 8/8 character. Died due to a lag spike FML 11/10 would do all this again  UPDATE â¥â¥â¥â¥. Kabam
6597	0	a	wow took hour 2 download and said i have not anoth room when my laptop is empty just steam and apb
10169	1	a	Great MMO,but graphics are kinda crappy
5476	0	a	I don't know why I am reviewing this to be honest I didn't play 26 hours of this game. It kept coming up and when I closed it then it came up again. So this game is alright, I guess you could call it a cheap rip off of GTA. This game really isn't to my interest I do not recommend this game. I would rate it a 4/10
10173	1	a	This game is exactly what i wanted it to be.... i have lost my self in this post apocalyptic world as if i was playing a fallout game  
2708	1	a	If you have a good graphics card, but to catch the realism of the graphics in GTA'll see.  Also, any items that unlock the fun of feeling can make you a basket case.  In addition, the items are free to unlock the fun you can feel that you can customize.  However, as mentioned above, this game is really high, or if you will need a computer with good specifications.
9791	0	a	This I can honestly say without a minor fragmant of doubt, is the worst MMO I've ever played in my entire life. I say that with full knowledge of Quest64.  â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ tutorials, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ controls, and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ graphics.  It wouldn't update at first no matter WHAT I did. Then after working my â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥ off it finally decided ot MAYBE just download. Don't bother with this, it looks good from the pictures, but let me tell you, when a game let's you go in first person, BUT only when you back up into a wall, your game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ed.    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ (Due to alot of backlash towards most of my reviews because little kids can't seem to understand what an 'opinion' is and get angry and overreact at something sticking out of the pervervial line, I must leave a warning. Thanks kids!)  This is my opinion, I make these reviews to get my opinion out there, if you disagree, I'm not saying my opinions are fact, in which case, no need to get â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off at something as trivial as a 'review' or 'opinion' I have an opinion and a mind that proccesses things and I like to let them be known rather than sheltered, weather it be good or bad. I'm not trying to change anyone's opinion on anything, if you disagree, calmly, put my thoughts into perspective, and see if you agree or not. If you don't want to do that and would rather rage over my opinion, then don't look at reviews, you're not mature enough to handle them.
1151	1	a	selling rare pepes please hit up my profile
10835	1	a	Can some 1 please help em i am facing some problems .. There is This (loading version error , Retrying) Well i Googled it i downloaded the new adobe with other Browser and Still Nothing Happened is there a problem atm ? or its just me? if its just me please please please Help me i really wanna check this game out &amp; thanks alot for your time =)
7683	0	a	So i hit play and all it does is takes me to their facebook page saying like me. HOW STUPID!
3269	1	a	Awesome Game (Y) :3
9251	1	a	Its alright, i guess.
1015	1	a	+ Fun game. - Idiotic community. - Pay 2 Win. 
9074	1	a	When I first started this game, I was expecting my computer to not be able to run it from the images. Luckily, the game ran a scan of my computer and optimized it for my computer and I run at max FPS. It is Fallout Online which I love. My issues with the game are that the graphics are not as beautiful as I would like but it is incredible for when it was released back in like 2008. When I start up the launcher and try to launch it, it will either tell me I cannot connect to internet (which is usually true) or that the server is having an issue, and also, lets not forget, this is a game where you are asked to upgrade but you do not need to, it is a one time request. However, disregarding the graphics, age, upgrading, and techincal issues, it does everything masterfully. You can craft and it is not instantly created, making it more realistic, you get a vehicle (horse) from the very beginning so you don't have to walk all over the Grand Canyon. You get a speed boost when you ride on the main roads, you can roleplay and go killing other players who are in PvP mode. I recommend it to anyone who loves Fallout and is dying to play it online with people.
2897	1	a	Customization in this game is pretty varied and cool. Missions start to get repetitive, but the rewards make up for it.
162	1	a	At first glance, APB Reloaded seemed stagnant and dry, like the barren tundra of a retired â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥'s once fertile ravine. The experience was shallow and the sense of accomplishment was too few and far between, leaving the uncertainty that a virgin feels after what may have been an instance of date â¥â¥â¥â¥ ; could one even call that a victory at all?  Now, standing at the frontier of this outlaw's paradise, I find myself wondering : am I playing this game, or is this game playing me?
8710	0	a	Ty for ban PB and GameFirst and ignore me. I played 2 years and U BAN.
4324	0	a	Possibly one of the worst communities I have ever experienced in a game. The general population of the servers expect you to know every aspect of the game before you even create your first toon and are unforgiving as you undertake the steep learning curve. I know I am not an elite player, but with time I am sure I could get the gist and hold my own in this 3rd person shooter, but the constantly being kicked out of groups moments before the final stage of a mission just shatters any illusion of enjoyment.  As an Australian player I already have to deal with a 200+ ping and in any pvp environment that will create problems but the lack of understanding/empathy from the APB community seals the deal for me. I will take my money elsewhere, I am sure there are many other 3rd person shooters that have an active friendly community. If this is how the game is currently running I don't really see a future for it as new players will be crushed by the overwhelming amount of arrogant, immature elitists.
2916	1	a	APB is an amazing urban fashion digital dressing room with some ok shooting and driving bits tacked on. Quite possibly the best avatar customization tech ever seen in any online game and worth checking out for that alone.
7910	0	a	either baltimore or detroit simulator 2015
4382	0	a	If a game were possible to be cancer, this would be it. I loaded the game, fell ill immediately, checked myself into a cancer treatment hospital and died. 0/10 would not play ever again.

1113	1	a	This game is amazing. I made an african american character and put chicken legs and racial slurs all over my car. Great game overall.
1547	1	a	Great game, don't know why so many bad reviews on the game, in my opinion it's one of the best games you would find on steam, for free!
3576	1	a	It's an ok game I guess.
7573	0	a	i play this game often but its fun, but there is one major thing i dont like in a PVP F2play. ITS A â¥â¥â¥â¥ING PAY TO WIN. There is no form of pve(maybe a bit for crims so mug and steal) like there is nothing to fight when you aren't in machmaking. (oh and before i forget SPEND 1,000+ DOLLORS TO INJOY THIS GAME IN PVP). The matching in this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ gold like to farm kills in new and bronze lvl sever(G1 fix that) most thing in arms is over priced and OP(i TRIED some) there is also lots of grinding for f2p players. And let me not forget. I HAVE NEVER SEEN SO MANY â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ IN ONE VIDEO GAME AT A TIME ITS SAD ALL THEY DO IS TALK â¥â¥â¥â¥ AND GO AFTER NOOBS. AND THEN INSULT YOU ITS SAD. Oh and dont get me started on bountys. &gt;_&gt; thats all i gotta say(wen you have a bounty no one can help you now kiddys .-.)  Now some good things(the few reasons i keep playing this game BUT havent spent a peny on it). The costumisation(it also has cons on to it). It is nice the fact you get to costimize your character BUT for F2P platers its limmited.   THE CARS(I LOVE MY CAR &lt;3) cars they have nice cars in game when you unlock them. (as a crim) MUGGING AND STEALING-FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN, BUT hold up there are some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥(if the car isnt owned by you) who will take from that car you stole and stored stuff in. They can also blow it up even if its yours or not. NOW FOR A LIST OF MORE CONS IN GAMEPLAY #1-Hit box-delay #2-aiming-SHOOT INTO THE WALL WILL YAH #3Cover-DONT HIDE FROM A SNIPER BEHIND A CAR they can still get ya #4-Pay 2 Win- OP guns in arms anot enough good ones in game #5-SSSPAWNING(more in fight club) GET READ TO BE STAWN KILLED #5-The matchmaking- unfair matchup (one team new players other golds). #6(im not to sure on this one) HHHHHHHHAAAAAAAXXXXXXX-from what ive heard that is. although ive seen some imposible stuff(no not like 360 noscope like in cod like shooting through walls always knowing where you are aimbot(i think)).  Over all I would recomend it but it has alot to fix, so its up to you if you wanna play it. And plz try to have fun dont take anything sereusly mainly because its a game.   (i just want car parts new clothes and drive around fancy looking is that to much to ask in a game).   (i am sorry for my spelling)   5/10
8664	0	a	great game, however, still awful controller support, down right unplayable for those who don't use keyboard and mouse
4817	0	a	Don't play it. It's as simple as that.  It's an interesting concept but it was poorly executed, has terrible graphics and has a horrible, horrible... HORRIBLE community surrounding it.  I honestly don't know if this game is relevant enough to even consider thinking of downloading, just because of how awful it is.

4088	0	a	&lt; Review by a highest rank/skill elite 'Gold' player with a â¥â¥â¥â¥load of hours wasted on it for the only satisfaction of kicking bully kid's butt. &gt;  WARNING: This game will make you want to see the real world burn and almost every human being die screaming in pain.  CONS: - Bad graphic (Screenshots look better than actual in-game graphic, and YEAH, I mean even with everything set on ULTRA)  - â¥â¥â¥â¥ty optimization: Intel i7 + GTX780 Strix 6GB + 24 fu*kin gigs RAM (pc used mainly as a Graphic WORKSTATION just to be clear) and this is the ONLY game so far that still shows stuttering, drops frames for no reason, etc. We are talking about 90-70 fps driving around and suddendly 30-40 fps with a single explosion on screen! The game graphic is from 2011... (for instance Battlefield 4 at ultra runs smooth lag-free at over 60fps costant framerate on my rig)  - Lag, server lag everywhere  - 99.9% of playerbase is made of bully â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ dumb4ss kids with 'I-Am-God' syndrome  - Weapons are as realistic as toy water guns. But much less fun.   - Customization is useless and boring, after a while you will just forget about it and just play the same missions again and again  - No need to keep adding to this list, just figure out every possible question about things in this game and answer yourself with a convinced 'IT SUCKS'   PROS: - If you're skilled enough you can eventually kill those dumb4ss kids and enjoy their never-ending whining followed by how much they are stronger than you and hear details about how they will own you, your mother/sister and (i don't know who else cause at that point they're in my ignore list already).
10256	1	a	Yes it is a very fun game and adventureous.
5560	0	a	S**t
2520	1	a	Best game i've seen that lets you choose whether to be a criminal or a enforcer. Its not pay to win, i myself use the starter gun and i get my share of kills. 8/10
5437	0	a	Unless you like people that are literal bullet sponges, don't play. Its 3rd person call of duty with a not so GTA twist. Save your hardrive space.
5594	0	a	It was unplayable because it would not load.
2655	1	a	sehr cool 
1133	1	a	After 1 flip car blown up 10/10 would flip it again
7533	0	a	Well its fun and all but ever since the old verison of it got removed and the good graphics got removed into â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ ones well it now sucks... :/ besides why they had to remove the styled 'choose your team' GUI and now its a basic one... And the menu instead of it having a criminal and cop its just a riot for the menu...
1354	1	a	Best f2p game on steam , ofcourse for people who know english , because if your english is not good enough ur gonna be â¥â¥â¥â¥ in this game cuz teamwork is a thing here. Ofcourse there is microtransactions but you can get premium from events and this code : SHAKERATTLEROLL
7193	0	a	Wont load on startup the menu comes us then it crashes
1834	1	a	i dislike that when loaded the game doenst show it self full screen and i cant open it but still plays and i cant control it
9289	0	a	Pros: The idea seemed cool. Poorly executed though.  Cons:  Clunky Controls, C**p gameplay, Pay 2 Win, 12 year old staff members with the ability to Powerflex when they choose to, and the list goes on.  Took me a few hours to download it, took me 5 minutes for Eric Cartman the moderator to find me and start talking smack and ban me because I refused to respect his authority despite him just being a massive do**he nozzle towards new players. Wasted so much bandwidth trying to play this s**t game. Would not recommend even p**sing in this games direction.
10721	1	a	great game, for the adventurous. can loose hours to this game!
9037	1	a	Fallen Earth is an RPG which offers a wide range of activities. According to me this is one of the best RPG offered in the world of videogames. It's not pay to win and it can also be considered a mix of Fallout and MadMax. Why?. Because it offers a wide map, such as Gran Canyon and veichles are available. You can drive a wide range of veichles such as ATV, motorbikes, choppers, Dune Buggy, sport totally customizable (there are even animals to mount)!. For people who think that it could be pay to win, i am able to tell you that it's not pay to win, you do not have to pay anything to be stronger than other players! There is people who tell that Fallen Earth is dead. This is not true. The number of players is increasing but at the same time some players stop to play because it's a a bit hard as RPG, but do not worry about it, you'll can join a clan which will help you to learn how to play and how to be stronger! Furthermore this game is also playable by players who have a low end PC, so don't worry about FPS.
788	1	a	There is better ways to hurt yourself than playing this game.
9366	0	a	full of crap.
7081	0	a	Want to try an MMO that's Free to Play!? This game has some of the best customization out of any game I've ever played. You can customize your character's clothing, appearance, tattoos, and even your car. It's FREE, check it out today!!!  UPDATE (1/1/2016): If I were you, I wouldn't waste your time on APB: Reloaded since it has become a Pay to Win style game. The company that took this game over has changed it from the glory this game once was.   You'd be better off NOT wasting your time with this title.
6929	0	a	This game is a ripoff of and its not even fun, dont get this game if you want a game like GTA, just get GTA instead of this crap
981	1	a	TLDR: There's only one or two real 'issues' with this game, and other than that it's pretty fun.  Before you play, just know that you will think this is GTA, you will pretend it's GTA, and once you actually get through about 20 levels worth of missions, you will realize how mistaken you were.  All points Bulletin: Reloaded (though I've never heard of the first APB unless my serial killer of an uncle is involved, shout out to you greg!) Is an 'action' shooter, semi RPG, MMO, racing, blah blah. It has little bits of everything except sci fi in it unless you consider the main item mall area where the weirdest â¥â¥â¥â¥s I've ever seen in my life casually parade themselves through the courtyard in a display of... just... I've never such creativity in a clothing editor since the sims 3, But anywho.  The game isn't bad, the community is decent though it'd literally kill them to add in a real 'Guild' system instead of this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ attempt of a gang or police possie they've tried to immulate. But I digress! Here's the main gyst of the game for you all who are bothering to read past the terrible jokes.  The game takes place in New York, scratch that, Los Angeles, it could also be Chicago. So the game takes place in [insert crime filled city with people who give no â¥â¥â¥â¥s here] where you, either a startup policeman, or a just beginning gangster are fighting for the city. The game is not a sandbox like I was hoping, I was expecting to get my first gun, walk outside, and immediately be blown to swiss cheese by anybody from any side, fortunately they have a smart side of the system that takes out SOME of the fun, but not all of it.   You pick your side, you get your first mission and off you go to learn the ropes. Of course being the upstanding citizen I am, I had to pick being a gangster am I right? Because 'If the police won't clean up the streets, we will!' and all that jazz. After the tutorial missons finish you have a small wad of cash, and the game throws you to the wolves after that allowing you as a gangster to either steal and sell cars, rob jewelry or electronics stores by ramming your car into the window conveniently, or by doing missions. Or you can be a cop and pray that you're in the vicinity of someone breaking the law, obviously you can see the perks of each side. That is a joke, there's only one side you should be playing at this point, and it involves the scantilly clad punk asses of the gangster side, why else would you be playing the game if there's no 'breasts' in them (thank you Steam for free speech and blocking out words for female chest pieces)  As you continue through the game you buy new weapons as your loadout for missions. Here's where the cross rival faction actually has some sort of real role in the game now. While on a mission, if it lasts longer than 1-2 minutes and you're struggling to pass a certain point, cops can be sent to terminate you on your mission. No no, not permanently, however the game's been out so long and missions repeat so often that you'll either be paired against A. A player who has no idea he's even after you. B. A player who obviously doesn't care and is just waiting for someone else to break the law to steal stolen money (just play a criminal you â¥â¥â¥â¥.) or C. A cop who has done nothing but bust people since day 1, knows every glitched spot to stop you from being able to complete you mission at all, and is able to 720 no scope you with a rocket from 300m out with a flick of his wrist, all while stroking his... ego. You get the gyst.   Like any other game, this game involves some sort of skill with shooters, or you just have to get that handy rapid fire shotgun and some body armor and not give any further â¥â¥â¥â¥s in the game. It's simple though, criminals get money, cops get money somewhat, both side saves up for better weapons and cars and armor until they can 720 no scope with rockets all day and not care.   In the end, the game has maybe a 6/10, I've like a lot of hours into this game but most of it was spent customizing my gangs clothing.  All in all, the character editor is 10/10, absolutely gorgeous, nothing bad to say about that, even at lowest detail. The mechanics for the game such as DRIVING I'll give it a 4/dipstick because whoever though it was a good idea to have your driving controls on the serverside instead of the clientside needs to be beaten with 2 bricks, 1 that is perfect in every way labelled 'Serverside' and one that's got some rough edges named 'Clientside'. Just uncontrollably flail the Servisde brick around his face for a bit until it eventually makes contact, and for Clientside, just give him a good whack as soon as he reads the name. Maybe he'll think twice about pressing W to go forward and waiting a full second before controls decide they'd like to move the car.  Cars still look sexy though. 6/10, would drive car like a snake again for some laughs and stop and stare at female avatars that make even straight women drool.
8561	0	a	Seriously, dont play this game. If you don't get kicked after five mins, for some stupid reason, there isn't even a storyline in this game. And there is no one playing anyways. Dont waste your time on this..
653	1	a	good and fun game enjoy playing it
10639	1	a	I LOVE THIS IS GAME. Nickname:ChLeno
8973	1	a	Spawns in, like 'Wtf is goin' on', gets on car bomb atv and blows up a wall or some crap, spawns in random place with Russians running around asking 'Hey you fat american pig, this is Dota right??'.  - 11/10 Would play again
542	1	a	This game is pretty nice, most items in Armas ( ingame market) its just clothes. But since clothes not give you any stats, its nothing. Weapons are mostly reskins. Company working slowly, so updates here kind of rare. But still this game worth to try.    Only 1 advice, don't play alone! Soloing in this game is unreal. Try to stay in your newbie districts (Green/Bronze) as long as you can ;)   Don't forget to read steam/forums guides.  gh hf
4535	0	a	Boring, Shooting Mechanics Barley work, Concept is awesome and needs to be recreated in other games, but you need a better engine, better company, and better gameplay. Words said, waiting for actions
5884	0	a	.
3412	1	a	Man, what can I say? I'm basically playing my character from San Andreas, busted out of Federal Prison after 10 years!   Different city, sure. But the street feel is familiar. High nostalgia hit for the violent 300lb homie covered in badly spelled jail tattoos. MO Cops and Robbers. Ultraviolent roadrage incidents. Taggin' grafitti spots. Rollin' in a group. Customizing clothes to wear or sell. Kitting out mods to make life bearable against live opponents. 4 levels of Threat: Green, Bronze, Silver, Gold...Open Bounties on Prestige 5 Enforcers and Notorious Criminals. Decent variety of vehicles and weapons to unlock.  Cons:- not real minuses, but worth noting. Playing from Australia on Han server, expect noticable lag if map population is over 40. Still playable with up to 60 on a map, but you better let someone closer to the server drive. Much past that and it's not great. There will be undrawn walls to collide with, stuttered audio and ghosting. But you can always hit the Marina Social District and work on designs, or swap map instances to a less populated map. Unreal Engine Driving Mechanics can be difficult to use. Important to pick the closest server. Match making can feel a bit off at times.  Pros: Multiple instanced maps. 3 mission districs with average threat level displayed, and open conflic maps where the matchmaking is turned off, plus Fight Club. But I won't talk about Fight Club. Unreal Engine Driving Mechanics are easy to learn. Same as basic movement substituting handbrake for jump. If you're a GTA fan who just wants to play Cops and Robbers with some open-world interactions and a story if you want it, this could well be the game for you. If matchmaking is off, or teams are unbalanced, you can call for backup.  Fairfight Anti Hacking seems to work, not much problem with hackers these days. The ban announcements pop up in the chat window for everyone to see. Doesn't appear to be Pay-to-Win, they claim tactics can win over load-out. I've seen that, too. Gold players will hand you your â¥â¥â¥â¥ unless you're an exceptional lower Threat player, in which case you'll go up in rating faster.   This is an &lt;R&gt; rated game. Not for kids. Thought I should mention that. Bombings, Arson, Carjackings, Muggings, Ram-Raids, money laudering, automatic weapons and bad language. It's rated &lt;R&gt; for a m___________g reason, yeah?   Welcome to San Paro.
3368	1	a	Love It
6509	0	a	it sucks
6893	0	a	This game Is a peach of work.... You start out as bronze but you face gold players the matchmaking sucks...... And its full of hacker's
6314	0	a	i'm ABSOLUTELY not recommend this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game, cause: i was on lvl 20 and the game dropped me with much higher lvl players (over lvl. 150) . The players playing like 6 yrs old kids.. : shoots their teammate, can't play in a â¥â¥â¥â¥in' team..  WORTH MMO IN THE WORLD
10755	1	a	Best game ever at times then the Worst game at others but was defently more fun before the KABAM nation attacked. Turining the game a liltle Pay-to-win 
1853	1	a	apb reloaded part 1

721	1	a	After 10+ hours of Internet disconnecting, I got it. Bad graphics card. 10/10 hours.
7737	0	a	Avoid this game like the plague. Horrible netcode. Horrible performance (Uses 1.5GB of RAM when minimized) and crap support. If you didn't like this in the beta, you definelty won't like it now. This game should have died when realtime died! - Overall score: 0%
7425	0	a	I dont have that many hours put into APB when I wrote this review. But from the time I've played APB at the lowest graphic settings and with 20 FPS I currently think its a decent game. It IS ONE OF THE FEW games that allow you to customize the absolute hell out of you and your cars. The combat system is OK, although infinite stamina isnt that realistic. 'Headshots' do the same damage on your head and your foot, which disables headshot instakills, sometimes good, sometimes bad.  Now about the buying system in APB. You buy a guy in the game, a decent gun. Do you have it? Yes, for 10 days. ARMAS marktplace, you can buy quite a lot of decent and nice stuff. Like nice packs which can include clothes, weapons, attachments, modifications, vehicles and emotes. BUT the best guns in the game you HAVE to buy with REAL money. Which makes this game lean even more to a P2W. Now if they were to put the best guns and every gun in the in-game shop which you buy with your well earned in-game money AND make them last FOREVER and not for only 10 days. I mean, you dont buy a car IRL to drive 10 days with it and then bring it back to the car dealer, do you? You dont go to the mall to buy some bread, eat it, then crap it out and then bring it back to the mall, do you?  I would give this game a rating of 6.5/10. It has amazing customization, an interesting server setup and a free-roam to mission 'map' but the developers are greedy, very very very very greedy. They want you to BUY somewhat EVERYTHING in the game to keep it FOREVER. Thats not how it works. Not at all.
9444	1	a	Amazing game one of my fav. games in the past Sadly it doesn't have much players..
4016	0	a	FreeToPlay GTA... With bugs,bad optimisation,graphics,money greedy... Go away already..
2240	1	a	Fun and addictive game, can be frustrating. Needs more content, the developers seem to only add variations of content already in the game.
3037	1	a	Regardless of the amount of people shouting pay to win, the game is somewhat enjoyable. The only downside for me is living in South Africa and not getting a good latency. If you looking for some gang related time to waste this is your game
1455	1	a	Fun game with my friends .
3499	1	a	This game is like gta online but with factions! 
2694	1	a	I don't even know where to start with this game.  I will say first that in my experience, if you don't have someone to play it with, this game will be borning as hell.  with a group of atleast one other person it is hands down one of the funnest games ever. as a criminal you can rob stores and what not which isn't very flashy but still fun.  and as an enforcer it is your job to you know....do cop stuff.    the only flaw to this game that i cannot stand, is the WEAPONS i swear not even with the starting gun i can stand still shoot someone in the back with a assault rifle and they never die, however someone else can shoot me across the map with a different assault rifle and 3 bullets kill me  its so F**KING annoying.   def worth playing tho especially if you can get someone to play with you.  also give it a few hours chance, the interface was confusing at first for me atleast but its worth it. play it. do it now. gogoogogogoggogo.   u.s server joker (na east) deputydann add me.
1991	1	a	This game is one of the best open-world games out there. It is often compared to GTA, but it is so much more than that. It has fully customizable characters and cars, big open-world map, and a social district completely for your customization needs. This game is way better than the way the people on here are making it out to be. It's free, so give it a try. You don't like it, your loss.
1636	1	a	Fun game, best open world cops vs robbers game out there for f2p players best than Gta lol
5527	0	a	BaD Game i cant play with this lag fix it ! and you wil receive great review!
120	1	a	It's decent. It's free. Anything you can buy, you can earn.
3374	1	a	It's a very good game. I just hope they keep adding new updates to it with more variety of clothes.
2943	1	a	Okay here's the scoop on this one. Its a great game, annoying, unfair and sometimes downright infuriating, but GREAT! The customization alone should attract you, but there are problems. The balance system is sometimes just strait up unfair as hell. It'll pit you by yourself against 3 other players while you alone attempt to capture an objective. The weapon balance is a MAJOR issue as well, most of the weapons they have in this game dont act like they should in real life, sometimes you can unload on a high player character and while your steadily putting shots into him he still has enough power to tun around and kill you with 2 bullets.  All and all this is a great game, just make sure you have a microphone to coordinate attacks and you'll do great!
6043	0	a	q: why would you play a game that needs over 900000 bytes   a: to wase cash on and lose tons of performance and storage 0/1000 will never play this game again untill they won a alien ware gaming pc. |:/
10378	1	a	As Space Cowboy said below 'IMHO, this is one of the best and underrated MMOs I've player on my entire gaming life (20 years of gaming so far).  Why, you might ask me? I'll tell ya.  STORY: The background story is amazing and it mixes Fallout series, Mad Max movies and also A Boy and His Dog references (if you ever saw this movie, you, sir, consider yourself lucky). The game has an unique atmosphere aswell. Not only a futurist set, but a post-apocalyptic one, finely made.   MAP: The map is HUGE, I mean, HUGE (already tell ya that â¥â¥â¥â¥ is huge?!). You could spent like 8-10 hours to cross the sectors on foot, if you make it alive.   CRAFTING:  Forget everything else about other's game crafting. This is THE â¥â¥â¥â¥.   You can craft your own vehicles or train your own animals! Ride a mutant chicken or a horse (you can have many, many different kind of horses) or go in a bad â¥â¥â¥ mode on a bike.  You can craft almost everything, even tents, campsites and stuff like that to get temporary area buffs.  Craft armors, firearms, melee weapon, explosives, medicine, steroids, recipes, foods, drinks, mutagenics... the list is so big that probably I'd spend all the reviews talking about it.   Also, you need to craft ammunition for your weapons and gas, diesel or biodiesel for your vehicles, besides ration for your animals and repair kits for heal equipment damage from fights.   After all, even if it bothers some people, I must say that I LOVE the time required to crafting. Everything you make by crafting need proper time to get done, from just a few secs to hours or even weeks. A single tire for a car requires 8-12 hours.   COMBAT: It's a partial FPS where you need to land your blows and aim to shot manually. No auto-target, which is great for PvP. Headshots cause a lot of extra fatal damage, rewarding you for your skill player.  The game have a lot of customization, meaning your character can max various skills to fulfill different roles on a party or even solo. You could be a mutant DPS or a healer, a gunslinger, a rifleman, sniper, fight with a big axe, two tires, be a sneaking rogue, a buffer/debuffer leader or pretty much anything.  PVP:  Awesome.  The game is partial-PvP. I mean, it's not a full PvP map, but, instead, we have PvP zones. On these zones, players need to fight over rare resources like petroleum! People can build settlements and siege-like stuff aswell.  The game has 6 factions which the player can join. Each one has it's owns charateristics, RP-related and PvP gear. These factions are at war/alliance relationships with each other.  The game also have a lot of player's guilds and alliances and people Pvping over resource nodes and PvP zones.  MORE PROS (MORE AWESOME IN YOUR AWESOMENESS): - Not just more of the same. It really brings something NEW and FRESH to MMO players looking for something special. - F2P (doesn't matter to me, but it's nice to try for free if you're not sure about it). - Buy, craft and dye clothes and use them over your regular armor on cosmetic slots. You can even paint and customize your car, bike, etc. - Active, nice and helpful GMs; 24/7 on chat. - A LOT OF DANCE MOVES, including MJ and the awesome Carlton Banks dance (Alfonso to his close friends). - A LOT of creative skills that you don't see everyday.  - Welcoming and active community (don't let the Steam numbers fool you, cause the most people playing it are using the non-Steam client).  - Deep and beautiful scenarios. - Scary voiceover (turn it off, man). - You have a flashlight. - Immersion feel on every step you take. - Level up takes a long long time, giving you some sense of importance in the world. - Awesome PvP. - You can fight while riding or driving! Man, EVERY SINGLE MMO should have this. Drive fast while unloading a submachinegun clip on a pursuit, why not? Not a Fast &amp; Furious type? You can do the cowboy Texas style aswell and shoot you Colt Anaconda on the horseback. - You can have a dog! (anyone remember Dogmeat from Fallout 2?) - Different paces of walking/driving/riding. You can walk, jog or run and drive/ride at speed as you like. Not so fast, no so slow, the way you want.  CONS: - One thing I dislike in this game is it's name. Should be called Awesome Earth. - Performance issues on some PCs. - 'Dated' graphics (I've player UO for 11 years, ask me if I give a dame for graphics?!) - 'Hardcore', even not having a full loot system like Darkfall, Ultima Online and Mortal Online (love them all). What makes this game 'hardcore' for some users is the fact that you need build and plan your character very carefully or it could be useless or disapointing at some point. - Unfriendly interface and learning curve.'  I agree 100% with him however ask me if I give a crud about graphics and I'll say no because I have been playing on a crappy pc with graphics as low as possible4 unlike him playing UO for 11 years [good game tho]. I definitaly recomend this game. It's the only game I am willing to spend real money on other then GTAV
6423	0	a	it crashes alot
6032	0	a	WHATEVER YOU DO. DO NOT INSTALL THIS GAME. FOR YOUR OWN SANITY.  Literally came back to check on the game and it is â¥â¥â¥â¥ED by hackers. LITERALLY BENT.
9302	1	a	Interesting game
4882	0	a	Another P2W (Pay to win) game. Pointless.
4806	0	a	Before I abandon this game for good let me say it's been quite ride and this is my final no holds barred honest review of this game. Make what you will of this review I am going to try and cover everything I saw good and bad, so you can make up your mind about it yourself but go in informed.   Pro's 1) Customization is great and you can do anything you really like, that to me is the hallmark of this game and it's greatest area it excels in, I myself did design and sell some great Bishada Rapiers when I played but it alone is not enough to keep me playing. But I reccomend it for customization options, and for that I give a 10/10 on the ability to do so.  2) Driving physcis is also nice, you have a variety of cars and how they handle varies by car and how you kit the body. However as someone who appreciates and enjoys racing in games this game has some really good driving physics, they did pretty good so even if they fail elsewhere this does help make up foe something.  3) Fight club is a great addition if your looking for pure action, however this comes with one of the cons that will be made apparent later, so please read further for the con of hackers/cheaters. Thr fight club is fun and challenging and you can getsomething you can use in game out of it if you do the objectives. Joker Tickets are something you can get some good stuff with but you need a lot of them. So for this feature yes I would say it's worth it if you just like combat or need to blow off some setam.  4) The car selection is great and you have a wide variety with many body kits, but these kits are ARMAS only and thus you have to pay in to get them. However there is enough of a variety of makes and models to satisfy anyone, though one shortcoming is a lack of motorcycles which would make for a more interesting experience.  5) The social district makes dealing with everything like customizing, selling, and hanging out with friends easy to do in a nice safe environment. Honestly it's a good idea to have, that way your not getting shot at while checking the market or ARMAS store. It is also the only area where you can go AFK and not time out from the game, so if you gotta go for an hour or two pop yourself there and go afk.  6) Weapon selection (non-ARMAS) is also expansive and covers a variety of weapons, however most of them are 10 day rentals for what you pay but it's worth it at times especially if they have slots you can fill your self with modifications. However there are also some real duds for weapons, and each weapon often is good at one thing but not good at another. However some advice, never discount your normal starter STAR 556 assault rifle. It is one of the best guns even if others would disagree, shiny new gun failing ya use your STAR. So IMO the weapon selection is nice compared to other games, as you can get a variety even if their temporary.  7) Modification system is also a plus, the various modifications allow for your own style of character, so to keep it simple this is a great feature.  Cons  1) The community is one of the most toxic communities in an MMO, when I did missions in bronze dsitricts you'd have silvers and golds playing there stomping everyone below their rank. Then they might say 'Get Rekt Noob' or something nasty and vile for kicks. This game has numerous trolls and A-holes who get their kicks in your misery, bronze districts are where most of the action are at but should be for bronze or lower only. Golds should stay in gold districts, and silvers should stay in silver districts. Also in social district you see a lot of sexual or perverse chat that is just distasteful, so often I ignored chat there. But as for more about this toxic community, I have been insulted and sneered at for even someof my hobbies if they came up in a conversation. A majority of the golds and silvers are elitist A-holes who like to wreck your day for easy wins.  2) Matchmaking/threat system is garbage, and as such makes for some very imbalanced matches that end up with one side having all of the advantages.  3) Small dev team means little gets done or it takes too long to do, therefore things they promised that should be out by now seem a long ways away from ever happening if they happen at all. The two biggest failed promises are the following. - Graphics engine upgrade - Matchmaking/Threat system overhaul  3) Hackers/cheaters are everywhere even with fairfight which JUST flags them and someone at G1 must ban them which happens more with the european servers than north american. If you want to play the frustrating fights against wall hackers, aim botters, trigger botters, and other â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ go ahead. Cheaters are why I mostly stuck to ram raiding and mugging, to be perfectly honest.  4) F2P limitations are horrendous, for example as F2P you can only do like 7 decals on a car compared to 50 for premium players. You can do like 12 or so to clothing comparedto 50 for premium players, and so on and so forth. They really limit one of my pro's with these paywalls on how many decals you can use. This is a great sign of a Freemium game which EA has pulled off with SWTOR, don't get me started on that pile of garbage.  5) ARMAS guns are great if you can afford them, not so great if your facing them and cannot match them. Those pieces of crap can do much more than anything you can get normally in game, unless your skilled with your weapon type anyone using an ARMAS gun will likely wreck your day. So prepare to pay an armand a leg to get oneof these permanently, as inless your paying 2000 to 3000 G1C your just renting them for a limited time.  6) Map layout is a hot mess and each map plays itself to a certain style of play that really limits options, so if you would rather more rooftop battles use Waterfront, run and gun battles use Financial. However the maps are limited in size and some areas that look accessible are invisiwalled off.  7) GamersFirst themselves are a greedy company who only cares about your money, they do not enforce the terms of service so if that enforcer is camping the criminal money laundry and busting and defeating everyone who comes to cash out. Tough luck pal, they can camp the laundry and contacts with no consequences. Players can grief you, harass you, basically be abusive A-holes and they will not discipline players even if reported properly.  8) Graphics are quite dated and we have not recieved the promised graphics engine update yet, so if you prefer better graphics then this game is not for you. In fact they out a buffer memory limit on customization because of how much memory ittakes from the game to show every detail you put into something.  Overall I would not reccomend this game, it is clearly being kept on life support by G1 via ARMAS and the elitist A-holes who keep playing and paying into it. You'd think they would put more money into it, but they do not. I would rather play Defiance than this for an MMO shooter, or for another game check out Triad Wars as it may be more to your style. So goodbye APB, I will not miss you and I have given as blunt a review as I can.
7215	0	a	i hate this stupid game i got 6 accounts banned with 5.000$ wasted on them. dont try to play this game and gamersfirst is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ all they do is just steal money and bann yourr acc. I recommend you guys not to get it and btw i have never hack in my apb account in none of them and boom! This account has been blocked (10008) I LOST 6 ACCOUNT because of this â¥â¥â¥â¥tards they make allot of money because of their â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t
5037	0	a	It's p. bad in like, every way, I only play sometimes because my idiot friends want me to and theyre good company, despite terrible taste in games.
5880	0	a	.
1110	1	a	Hackers, Aimbots, Scum of the earth...  That's the APB you know and love. No matter how many times this game kicks you when you're down, you'll always come crawling back!
9300	0	a	Well, i played this game about 1 year ago + and it was nice game i enjoyed it it was original something new for me like a apocalyptic games fan and MMORPG i was excited but now.... its trash all i can say.
1643	1	a	Good, I guess.
4192	0	a	this game is pay to win system and they can ban you for nothing becouse the banning system is really bad even if u have no cheats or hacks or something else it can ban even if u got another client of this game like i had the russian one where was the russian searvers and ukraine servers too in that time i lounched them both becoues i forgot to turn of the russian client and punkbuster thought that it was some kind of cheat and banned me forever i tryed to ask the support of the gamersfirst but they said no we cant do that so i am saying it is just my opinion that apb is the worst game ever
7869	0	a	this game Horrable and Broke DONT PLAY IT! Unless you enjoy rage quiting...  Has some interesting ideas but fails to stand up on them
7428	0	a	I know the game is free. I know this. Does it mean I have to forgive it for being crap? No.  This game is exactly what I would expect from what is essentially a free-to-play Grand Theft Auto. Everything feels about ten years old, there is lag and general bugginess, and not a sh*t was given by anyone else as to whether the objectives were being carried out.  I didn't play a ton, but sometimes when you experience something, you are able to read it for the best that it could be independent of the momentary experience. This game doesn't have the capacity to entertain for the long term. Free-to-play games rarely do, though I feel I do have to mention Counter-Strike as one of a few exceptions to that rule. To be fair, though, this game is much newer than CS, and yet learns nothing from it or games like it.  This game seems more or less like a controlled environment from which get trolled other people than a legitimate attempt at entertaining; I knew that the first time that I attempted to kill the person with the briefcase, only to be shot from a vantage point directly above me that I had no hope of approaching from any other direction.  Take it for what you will - I played the game as long as I could stand to.
437	1	a	This MMO is crazy fun. It's just massively multiplayer, cops vs. crimnals, Grand Theft Auto style ridiculousness. The in-game transactions are totally optional and not necessary. You can enjoy this game for hours upon hours for free.
3315	1	a	A good GTA like game that has a lot of customizations but it is multiplayer. A lot of missions and contacts that are fun to play with. But there are many hackers in the game which sucks. But it is really an awesome game after all. I will recommend this game to open-world gaming fans. :)
9578	1	a	worst game ever 10/10 would unistall again
3642	1	a	Great game
1158	1	a	The best shooter there is as long as there no hackers in the game your playing.
2092	1	a	Interesting. Need to play more.
161	1	a	GTA meets the Sims (as far as character/vehicle customizations go). The has some age on it, but it never gets old driving around San Paro with your posse, doing drive-bys while blasting music from your car speakers. Go Enforcers!
2751	1	a	The potential of this game is high and that was already noted in the fact that it was picked up by a secondary company and 'reloaded' to make it into at least something worth playing. The main issue with the game i would probably say is funding as it is a free to play game. I would say this isn't normally to much of an issue if they would have re-released it and then balanced it or at least tried to balance it. With that said you will find yourself constantly out matched, out gunned, and battered into submission by the other players. That is until you make it to the tip top and can finally find some way to hold your own. If the enemy players arn't enough to get to you, the chances that your own team's derogatory comments will. If you can handle the backlash from your own team, the constant balance issues, and the lack of dev well everything then enjoy.
4325	0	a	*sigh* where do I even start with this unoptimised garbage lard piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ of a game? 'what? unoptimised? Your PC must suck!' NO â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ I GOT A 970 UP IN THIS B*TCH with an i5! so don't hop on my d*ck. This game run at 50fps with dips THE GRAPHICAL SETTINGS DON'T DO SH*TTTTTTTT SON. The graphics aren't even good anyway. It looks like a sim city saints row 1 a** graphics. Lastly NOTHING I MEAN NOTHINNNNG is explained. I spawn in with this stupid a** WHITE TRASH NASTY GIRL and some pledge so ol bull. if my pc can run sr4 and everyother games with HUNDREDS OF FRAMES THIS PARASITE OF A GAME SHOULD RUN ABOVE 500 frames OR HIGHERRRRRRRRRRRRRRR      I'd rather rub my â¥â¥â¥â¥ on a cheese grinder than play this game.
10447	0	a	This game is so lagging i cant play it. It just crashes everytime i walk. Game gods FIX THIS!!!!!!!!!!
3162	1	a	there were several bugs, but now its awesome! :3  cool with friends
4426	0	a	How can this game be on Steam? There is lag every day and the game is so unbalanced, ritteled with P2W weapons, yes, P2W. Some people claim that the weapon are situational, which is true to some extent, but overall there are a selection of weapons that picked over other weapon because they are generally superior to other weapons.   This game should be removed from Steam because it does not reach the quality that Steam should require from games. The developers are ignoring all the problems, gold servers are never used, the threat system is completely broken, gold players play on Silver districts and silver players play on Bronze districts.  The amount of players who use aimbot and triggerbot are staggeringly high. Every day you run into someone who kills an entire opposed team with secondary weapons. I don't understand why they don't change the anti-cheat system when the current one is obviously a total failure.  This is APB: server lag, weapons that are op(like ATAC, which they intentionally do not nerf, just to sell it for a while), fun as hell when there are no cheaters(car chases, fast-pased action), cheaters, griefers, stutter-lag, broken match-making, broken threat system, in-depth customization...  The cons far outweighs the pros, so remove it!
3612	1	a	90% of the players are female in the game ofc
1980	1	a	Its still a cool game i think and one of my most played games If it had updates at all it would make more people want to play...     This game hasn't been updated in like 4 years 
5034	0	a	i can play this game 
5145	0	a	The idea behind this game is great; it's like GTA with a ton of customization for multiplayer.  Unfortunately, progression is painfully slow. After 53 hours of gameplay, the vast majority of which was spent in missions, I had enough money for a vehicle and 1 or 2 weapons that were only to last 10 days before disappearing. Also, I had barely unlocked any upgrades.   The matchmaking system is hard on newer players.  Here is a common matchmaking scenario:  Match 1: You're against newer players...either an easy win or it's pretty even  Match 2 (after winning match 1): You're against veteran players with dreamteam equipment or newer players that have dreamteam equipment thanks to the cash shop [either way, you're at a flat disadvantage]  After losing match 2, you return to match 1...and on and on     Regardless of your skill, you've gotta be willing to feed the game money or a whole lot of time if you want a fighting chance. Strategy only goes so far in this platform.  fun for only a short while
6583	0	a	Just terrible. I played it for 20 mins and deleted it when I realised it's just a tacky rip off of GTA.
8551	0	a	So I wrote that section at the bottom way back in 2014, recommending the game. I've since changed my opinion.  Honestly, this game does have great potential, but it's wasted by empty promises for better updates and non-stop premium shop content releases.  A lot of weapons are simply not viable thanks to a small meta selection that out-performs the rest, and the developers aren't looking to balance things out any time soon.  Terrible match-making paired with terrible mission objective locations means you'll eaver be the team that stomps, or the team getting stomped. There's no close matches anymore, it's always a hard win or a hard loss.  Developers have repeatedly promised updates that will fix things, such as an engine update for optimisation, chat moderation systems and weapon balancing, and each time a deadline has been given, it's come to pass with nothing but a few new premium items added to the market.  If you want to try this game, â¥â¥â¥â¥ it, it's free after all. Just don't invest your money into it, at this point the game deserves to die.  __________________  It's undeniable that this game has a great, unique concept and is literally brimming with potential. Endless customization and plenty of things to do let you truly shape your own life in this non-linear game.   Hours, days and even weeks can be spent on this game without losing interest and entertainment.   Sadly its full potential is yet to be met by the developers who bought out this game, but recently hope has been lit as they detail changes they're working on.   I wholeheartedly recommended this game to everyone, despite it's flaws. The entertainment this game delivers is truly noteworthy for a free to play game.
3320	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Awesome ( All I Have To Say)
2725	1	a	GREAT AND LAG SOMETIMES BUT STILL LOVE THE GAME 
9569	0	a	this game sucks you need an account to that game to play it.
8785	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this
3489	1	a	A horrible example of grand theft auto. You do missions but it was all PVP. There was hardly any info on the game other than 'awesome' descriptions that don't match the actual game after 2 hours of play.  The community around the game was just as bad, nobody answering questions on the chat channels or even trying to group up. Leave it all to auto-queue and don't bother trying to make friends inside the game.
8531	0	a	I remember playing this like 3 years ago. And when i did, the game was plain up boring. The reason is that the game is way too pay to win - a cliche that most free games use to get atleast some profit... and that profit is way too off top and just unfair.  Terrible and boring - that's my experience.
3767	0	a	'Oh yeah, the engine version update will happen soon.' ~2014 'Yeah, don't worry, soon.' ~2016  tl;dr -p2w -low population -tryhards and hackers -toxic community -lots of lag  Current state is pretty bad. Very addictive, but at the same time very bad. Devs seem to pump out more virtual things (microtransaction things, not free) than fixes to problems. Recently many legitimate players have been getting banned for 'harrassment', and the overall active-player count has been falling. Items are insanely overpriced ($40 for a permanent virtual weapon? Come on, now), and new players usually don't stand a chance against 'hardened' veteran players. Community is pretty toxic for the most part, and the game seems to be more frustrating than fun to play. Hackers are also common.
725	1	a	Very good game. Really fun in groups and just do missions or mess around just ram raiding shops or causing complete mayhem on the streets of San Paro. Shame thing is there is a free to play type account, and a premium, which is better than free to play cos there are more features. But other than that, really good game, well, a good free game at least, worth the m....erm, i mean, free-ness?
3444	1	a	  -Really fun gameplay -Graphics are okay -2 Teams -Open World Multiplayer!
8291	0	a	  It seems like a good game but i can't play it because the servers are amazingly bad. Unplayable.
8404	0	a	Nah. Grand Thieft Nighto is better. Long live Sam Pepper.
5208	0	a	Not worth your time
1440	1	a	Hackers, russians and germans infested pay2win game.  Only play if you have nerves of steel or alot of money.
8924	1	a	For a Free Game, this game rocks! In 2 days I have already put 20 hours into the game. This game has so much to do, and so much is going on, that you are spoiled with missions and activities! If you're looking for an RPG in the Post-Apocoliptic era, or you just wanna play a game similar looking to Fallout, than this is a game I highly recommend downloading, whats even better is if you don't like it you're not losing anything because its FREE, and I am surprised it is after how much fun this game is. I highly recommend this game to anyone looking to play a good game and have fun with other players. This game has most pieces to an RPG game such as Clans, Events, Tons of Weapon, Armour, and Clothes! It also has skills you level up after getting AP Points, which yout hen use to upgrade your skills. The crafting system is also nice, and you can basically craft almost anything.   (PS if you're trying to download this game and you think the Update downloader is stuck, its not. I also thought mine was stuck and after looking up how to fix it I found no solution when turns out I just wasn't being patient. I started the downloader and left it on over night and it was finished by morning! Hopefully that helps any of you that have that 'problem'.)
6612	0	a	this game is straight up meth. hooks you in to the game. yet the game itself isn't good in anyway.   if your enemy has a better gun, your dead. how to win fights with equals, jump,crouch, act like a madman with a gun.  oh you want to know about the cars? well you can literally blow up a car by running into it with yours if it's fast enough. unavoidable death to teh opposing side. you can't shoot trough windows. takes forever to blow up teh car (unless you got a real money bought weapon) , which the driver gets a notification 10 full seconds before. unless ofcourse you got a rocket launcher. which insta kills anything, you can't really miss. and if you don't have a payed for gun. don't even think about shooting at a guy with a launcher. he will turn around and set you flying off better than north koreas rocket program.  oh you want guns? well you either buy it again every 10 days or you pay real money for it. even up to 40$. not even kidding.  only the basic concept of the game is good. but the game is literally designed to minimize skill out of the game. thus having better guns be an absolute grindfiest to get. or you pay for it. in real money.  only 2 good things, the character creation is actually quite good, but since it allows you to change your height, there is absolutetly no headshot dmg multiplier of sorts. hit him anywhere adn the same dmg is applie.  and for the otehr ofcourse the uninstall process. this game is horrible.
1325	1	a	I started playing the game openmindedly and well yeah, Id highly recomend this game! Its alot of fun! Bit confusing at times and some aspects aren't the best but overall is a great game to play!
7314	0	a	DO NOT GET THIS BUNNY HOP SIM. EVERY and i mean EVERY enforcer bunny hops camps and does everything scummy do no waste your time or space with this pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥ and â¥â¥â¥
10482	1	a	This is a sandbox game of sorts with the elements of games such as DayZ,Fallout and Rust.However,since it lacks the visual beauty of DayZ and the back story of games such as Nether and Fallout,it is not quite as popular as one might hope. The game still requires some tweeks here and there but with patience and some tlc,this game has extreme potential. The depth of crafting and exploring is truly unique along with the optional co-operation of other players. It's been quite awhile since I last played this game but I believe it deserves a second chance from those who shun it due to graphics and any slight game play bugs. All in all?Give it a chance.
2948	1	a	wow, i have not played anything so bad in my life.. soooooo not coool. terrible physics
6817	0	a	Servers keep going down due to ddoser been hours and days its been happning. There staff cant do crap about it. The company is to cheap to get real ddos protection or better hosting and i think theres a virus in the game due to reports and some one got there credit card stolen. I loved the game but you cant even play and there company wont do anything about it. Plus the games pay to one hit some one basicly.  Tiggs Sept. 6, 2015, 9:15 p.m. (6 hours ago) 9:14 PM CDT: We're restarting Social District.   If you see a problem with any districts, please reply below with the district name, and a brief description of the issue.   Tiggs Sept. 6, 2015, 9:27 p.m. (5 hours ago) We're going to do a restart, the districts didn't like some things we changed.   Tiggs Sept. 7, 2015, 12:23 a.m. (2 hours ago) I know it's frustrating for you all, it's just as frustrating for us. We have been working on this since yesterday. Right now we're putting more protection in place to see if that helps.  Tiggs Sept. 7, 2015, 12:36 a.m. (2 hours ago) Well you had DDOS protection earlier this year and it worked well, so what changed?   Little script kiddies got smarter?   They blame other people and cant even fix the promblem themselves even indy games have better protection than this garbage.
6193	0	a	My game keeps crashing and nothing can fix it this game sucks  
3973	0	a	I thought it wasn't any good out of ten i would give it a 1 because you have to make a account first. Plus it is saints row but rubbish so my opinion is just get GTA or Saints row, they are better because APB is cheap you can't do half the things you can in GTA.PLease don't get it. this is my experience and you would know what I mean.
37	1	a	Try it out. No p2w. Customization is pretty amazing.
1595	1	a	best game there is for free to play 
4575	0	a	You want to be shot down by hackers? then this is the game for you ENJOY!!
8389	0	a	Missions always favor the Criminals.  Crim gets to back a van into their objective? That means I HAVE TO CLIMB A â¥â¥â¥â¥ING TOWER TO GET TO MY OBJECTIVE.  I have to guard an objective for 5 minutes? That means THE CRIMINALS ONLY HAVE TO TOUCH IT ONCE TO WIN.  I have to fight for half the mission against a team of snipers to get one open field objective? That means THE NEXT 3 OBJECTIVE WILL BE IN THE EXACT SAME SPOT.  I have to drive all the way across the map? That means THE CRIMINALS ARE ALREADY THERE.  The entire game is designed to benefit criminals.   DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME
1428	1	a	I've played this game for a long time, it has been great watching it grow, weather good or bad, The dev's of this game are very hardworking and in general sweg dudes. They have particularly worked on fixing the pay to win system, they don't care about money. Overall i would rate this a 7/10, its good when you start but after 500 hours it gets repetitive
10400	0	a	It has all the classic elements of a crappy RPG like:   a hassle-filled control scheme  A boring overused plot  forcing you to sign up for their spam emails just to play  cookie-cutter character foils  Poor voice acting  Even worse sound effects (as in literally 0 noise, even when using a machine gun)   enemies who respawn way too fast (as in right after you already kill them)  and a story that goes absolutely nowhere.  2/10 Better off on Runescape m8
4774	0	a	its a bad game to play for people who like gta style type gaming because the game itself isn't realistic and gun aren't good too 
5	1	a	If you're looking for a game review you've come to the wrong place. But if youre looking for a fantastic ravioli recipe you've come to the right place.  Ingredients - To Make the Dough 375 grams (3 cups) plain flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 eggs 1/4 cup (50 ml / 3Â½ tablespoons) olive oil 1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) water Extra flour for dusting    - To Make Cheese Filling 15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese 5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) '3 Cheese Italian Blend' (Parmesan, Romano &amp; Asiago) Note: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend. 1/2 cup cheddar cheese 2 eggs, lightly beaten 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon pepper   - Extras Your favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana) Parmesan cheese Basil Fried vegetables Shrimp Fish slices Chicken pieces  Make the Ravioli filling.  - In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork. - Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper. - Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency. - Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.   Make the Ravioli dough.  - Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix. - Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed. - Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough. - Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic. - Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters. - With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles). - Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesnât suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor.   Fill the Ravioli shells.  - Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough. - Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle. - Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a âhomemadeâ touch as well. - Repeat this process for all your dough circles. - Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together.   Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.  - Roll the dough into two sheets - Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups. - Fill with the ravioli mixture. - Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling. - Remove and separate the finished raviolis.  Cook the Ravioli.  - Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil. - Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test. - If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest  - Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed plates  Serve it up. Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!
8263	0	a	The game was fine at first, But then it got â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. When you are doing missions, Its super unbalanced. 2 robbers vs 5 cops. Unfair. Also it shouldnt be 'Noobs vs Pros'. The cops are always super OP and the criminals are weak. And the loading time is terrible. I have a great PC but it take ages for this game to load. It doesnt even have very good stuff in it so it isnt worth ut.
3300	1	a	This game is very great i love it.
9150	1	a	Truthfully, I had a great time with this game. Sure it had that lingering Pay to Win idea on it, but you could do okay without paying a cent. While this game has been replaced with Fallout, I can't take it out of my library simply due to its nostalgia factor it has.
8004	0	a	Great Game. One of the game that has held my attention the most. Played it for 2 years...  But, When that is said.. It has also been the most expensive game ever. And its a FreeToPlay!   The game offers a wide varity of guns, advantages, clothing and bodykits for cars = If u got the money.  I would understand if Premium was the only cost ingame. But taking money for 60% of ingame features is just wrong.  The itself is great, but the community is rude and lacks co op, The game is full of hackers, And its a Pay2Win game.   Not just Pay2Win, but Pay2Havefun...   GamerFirst really destroyed a great game.
1960	1	a	Worth a download.  aka AMAZING!!!
2562	1	a	Its rediculously fun

1814	1	a	Run around in a pair of briefs and a tie while cops yell at you to do something criminal.  10/10
2629	1	a	Easily a great game with amazing customization aspects and gameplay, but unfortunately falls short due to a mediocre matchmaking system. If you're persistent enough to push through the bad parts of the game and play with friends, there is a huge potential for lots of fun to have.
3208	1	a	Oh my god this is amazing! The action! The excitement! The love! The scenary! The time!                           I got from uninstalling this

5501	0	a	Unfortunately an excellent idea for a multiplayer open world 3rd person shooter is handicapped by inherent game features that frustrate and annoy me beyond what I'm willing to tolerate. Not recommended.
2823	1	a	really fun when working with people.
1682	1	a	Is Good Game!!!!
8823	0	a	This game makes me want to kill myself!
8184	0	a	If you value a game with a matchmaking system dependant on your skill and how well you play based on teamwork criteria, you literally chose the opposite game for those. The game is 1005% pay to win, prove me other wise. Connection issues are almost 100% constant. Developers have no clue what they're doing with matchmaking, I'm using a level 3 gun getting matched with level 5000's with fully body armor and maxed out stats.   Overall uninstalling the game was much more relaxing and rewarding than the actual game, I'd go so far as to say reading the Terms of Service for this game is more rewarding than the actual gameplay itself.
5050	0	a	This game, is BAD. Let's start of by saying you play with the best players at the beginning of the damn game, who have all the best gear, the best cars, and can easily tank all the noobies around. There are hackers everywhere, I was just driving along my merry way down the street, with no enemy in sight, when suddenly, I died. I have no clue how that happened, it could've been a bug, but I blame hackers, none of the games I've played have ever shot me in the face while I drive down in the street. Have fun trying to get any objectives done, if you're a noob with a team of pros, you're going to make them fail, and it will only be you, you want to know why? BECAUSE THIS GAME SUCKS â¥â¥â¥.
5312	0	a	1/10 would never play again
6180	0	a	so i think i'v played this game enough to give it a quick review (1250 hours if you wondering) so lets get started  i started to play this game about 3 years ago and it was fun (it is too now but not as it was back in a day) and then gamers first came in... they pretty much killed all the game potential...  i DO NOT recommend this game (play it at your own risk, i warned you) IF u have not played it before, why you probably ask, let me tell you why:  1. the community is toxic (do not even test it) 2. heavily P2W (put into this game 300$, and i 100% regret it) 3. this game updated 1 time in a year, and when they do update it, its a new P2W weapon 4. the engine in this game absolute crap (not even to mention that they soppused to upgrade the engine in 2013, they didnot even got it out after 3 years) 5. the physics are..... physics (witch mean they absolutely stupid, you've never seen this stupid, belive me) 6. the real cash items prieces are stupidly high ( lets say you want to put into this game 30$ witch is nice amount, you get only 2500G1C witch is the real cash game credits and you cannot even buy with that a simple bundle, you get the idea)  the only thing that i do recommend and i do like and want to be in other games is the design and the costumization level that this game have. so if you want to try this game for the game play, like i said its not recommended but if you want to try it for the costumization, i say so ahead. so the thing that i do recommend is below:  1. you can pretty much costumize everything in this game (due to the P2W level you got a limit for that and you need to buy premium if you wanna do really nice stuff) that inclodes: cars, clothes, kill theme (everytime you kill some it plays a music that you put) symbols 2. there is a ingame marketplace that the player can sell pretty much everything to other players  so, if you planning to play this game alone and you really want to who i am to say no to you but its not recommended, if you have NOT played this game before, i do not even recommend that you even download this game (unless you coming for the design things) if you does not planning putting any money into this game (witch you should not even think of because its completely waste of money) i do not recommed because you cannot really do much without a premuim and other suff that you have to buy with real cash, and lets not talk about the MM in this game (belive me its the most â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥iest MM out there)   so pretty much if you not planning about wasting all your money into this game and you like crap MM, toxic community, hardcore P2W game style and you didnot played it in the past, DO NOT EVEN THING of even trying it out its completely waste of time (and i know i keep saying this but this game is crap).  overall game expirence 3/10 - could be 10/10 with a better company behind this game
6704	0	a	It looks like a real good game but the vehicle handling is very poor.   Also, it is hard to learn to play as a newbie. You won't know who's who and will keep running out of bullets. Other players who are a higher level will come in and blast you out of existance, because they have more powerful weapons. Most of the weapons seem to be overpowered, (only been on the wrong end of them of course).  The GPS is next to useless, so unless you know the map, you have a hard time finding your way around.  Other players won't let you play your own game, or won't leave you alone, killing you on sight for no other reason than you are on the side of the law / or the side of the criminals, (as soon as you've ready'd up).   My advice is to make friends with other more experienced players ASAP then you might stand a chance.   I did team up, but the players I teamed up with were also at the mercy of more experienced players. It makes this game a real pain in the â¥â¥â¥ and a waste of time to play.   Very little rewarding gameplay at the start, makes this an awful game to play as a newbie. You will get bored with being killed time and time again!  I spent two hours dying all the time and got so fed-up with the silly car handling that I am giving up on this game for now. 2014-08-17.   Sign-in - Sign up problems. (With GamersFirst). I also played this before when it first came out, I was annoyed that I had to go through the sign up process all over again, and even though I know my email and password, it refused them and I had to start again. When it came to my username, it won't let me have it, claiming it is already in use! (Well, yes it is - BY ME), but it won't let me sign in with the my original username anymore.  Overall:- a waste of time. I do not recommend it!
5136	0	a	its exactly like minecraft
1348	1	a	not a bad game if i do say so myself when u play this u get a chice between gangsters and cops you get to choose aliances with major crime synidacate's and many more check it out
9496	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ game don't try to play it its like combat ars â¥â¥â¥â¥ this â¥â¥â¥â¥ omg !
9697	0	a	This game is terrible. That's all you need to know about it.
3443	1	a	5/5 would flip my 4x4 vegas again
6522	0	a	The game seemed promising enough at first but when I got in a car I noticed the most peculiar of happenings. The driving lagged...a lot. like when I tried to turn left, it wouldn't turn for like a second or so after I pressed the button, leading to some frustrating driving. This one seemingly insignificant drawback successfully ruined the game for me.   Final Verdict: 2/10
5707	0	a	game is terribad 11/10 do nat get is vry tedios and sucks â¥â¥â¥â¥ wen u haz bed compoopder
1045	1	a	Haven't even been able to start the garbo thing without screen flickering or facebook adverts. 11/10 best game ever once it's uninstalled.
2987	1	a	While hackers run rampant in this F2P and there is occasional lag, as a shooter game it's one of my favorites. GTA type gameplay, full customizable options, can be easily played solo or with a group.
247	1	a	I recommend it, no dirty stuff like GTA V. It's fun to play when your bored. Make new friends in it and play together. Invite your Steam Friends to play too!
7712	0	a	As soon as it was done installing, it would just show a small box and not the actual game so thats why I'm going to uninstall then reinstall to see if it works. If it does I'll send a Yes on recommending it, if it doesn't then I'm going to try to send a No on recommending it and go talk to someone about it.
2809	1	a	Free-To-Play, is about the only reason to pick up this game. The community is small, and it's not as polished as it could have been. That being said, it does have it's fun aspects. Everything is a little confusing/overwhelming at first because you're kind of dropped into the world without much of a tutorial, but it's not difficult to work out. Having a friend who plays or would play with you religiously would make it a decent way to spend some time.   Overall I give it a 6/10, it just seems like a dying game that didn't live up to it's potential.
4527	0	a	Game had alot of potential, the publisher G1 ruined it. Don't throw money on your screen when you browse ARMAS, the ingame shop. Spend it on something else instead and don't support this company which is treatening their customers like they were a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥.
6573	0	a	This game ruined my computer.  It made my computer say 'Busy Writing On Disk' and i blame it on this game.   Pros: Customizable characters,lots of guns.  Cons:Laggy,hard,Pay 2 Win,Ruined Steam
1634	1	a	Very cool game :)
4119	0	a	This game repeatedly put me in its website to register, when I already had AND downloaded it. This game is stupid and should not take that much effort to play. I went to at least 6 different websites, each one telling me to register.
10812	1	a	So, first of all, I would like to acknowledge the quality of gameplay this outstanding game has brought upon me. Because of this game, it has made me want to kill myself on a daily basis, has given me the thought of joining the KKK and has made me want to vote for Donald Trump. The feelings this game has given me has opened my eyes about how cruel this world is and how better off I am becoming a stripper. Games like this have given me such unforgettable memories that I will unfortunately cherish forever. Moments that I still remember after starting this game one year ago. Where I died as an archer to a Scorpion King with its very OP family of bratty scorpion children, and the first time I've gotten a white bag, in which I lost right away after some monsters came in from the other room of an Undead Lair dungeon. After all of these overwhelming events, I reccomend this game to any toxic kids from XBox Live so they can feel just how we feel when they tell us to drink bleach. 10/10 Game.
6189	0	a	This game is gay. An need to fix their hackers problem. IF I HAD BROUGHT THIS GAME I WOULD SEND A LETTER TO THE PEOPLE WHO CREATED IT. SAYING: F!!!!!!! U!!!!!!!! . BUT I DO LIKE THE IDEA OF IT. JUST GET RID OF HACKERS! 0/10 for now. Ps people reading this I dont care about grammer.
9816	0	a	i dont even remember playing this lol
6539	0	a	That lady's pants are about to fall off.
2417	1	a	i really like this game as a free alternate of Grand Theft Auto and some parts of the Newesat game to the Ubisoft Librtary,Watchdogs,really fun
8329	0	a	TLDR:    Great ideas bought for naught after bankrupcy and then turned into pay2win hell with no actual game improvements since the take over.     Once upon a time, some developers made a game with huge potential and many nice concepts. Unfortunately they went bankrupt before the potential could be fulfilled. Luckily another compay bought the game and turned it into a more profitable one!.... By making it pay2win, thus securing the games future, at the low price of of the game turning from a fun yet incomplete game into a horrible pay2win game, which is also incomplete.  I did enjoy myself for a while, but as soon as it dawned on me that no amount of grinding would put me on par with the pay2win crowd, I lost interest and moved on.
9927	1	a	A good Post-apocalyptic game.  Sorta confusing and not knowing what to do at first but you get there.  Haven't spent much time on it but it's a good game.
86	1	a	this game sucks if you are not a sick dank top fragger like myself and others that i play with if you do not play with me or the others with you are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and dont deserve to be a top fragger like myself and you should quit this game because Tiggs the community manager of this amazing game will find you and ban you and say you were ban evading even though you really weren't this is pure meth i love it and hate it at the same time the only reasons i hate it is because the management is complete dog â¥â¥â¥â¥ and i hope they all die sometime. but i still play it and enjoy it somewhat because im a top fragger\   ALSO if you are actually good at the game 'FairFight' will ban you! this happened to me twice!
1482	1	a	i love this game and dont even mind paying for a car n a gun this kept me going while i awaited gta V for pc but the server lag is unbareable and near unaccepible for a game like this what requires a good connection, i last played months ago for halloween but i got the same feeling when i sat and played gta V after the hours of download and install to finally play i sit there and then watch youtube videos for the next 4 hours wondering how these guys seem to have so much fun in said games but yea seeing as it free to start off and mission and heists earn you cash to rent weapons and buy cars and mods from trade i do recommend this game so really you dont have to spend a penny but it takes some effort
6350	0	a	Honostly I do not like this game, it is sure of an offbreed from the gta series, and the original arcade game of APB.
1737	1	a	&lt;3 love this game! Customization is freaking amazing, but matchmaking is kinda â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up and there are a lot of hackers... 
2484	1	a	This game is like a Free GTA, plus more
9019	1	a	I like the Game alot and it is a great way to have fun the crafting is top notch and the ability to go threw the world and get items the only thing that bugs me is my lag but thats expected i would give this game 5/5 great game.
2255	1	a	Most addicting game ever!
2807	1	a	this game has change a lot but what sucks is low lvls get kill my higer lvl people but other than that the game is pretty good
3959	0	a	The game starts out great you can ride with your friends stealing or protecting and then IT haappens the pay2win you join a match eryone is the same lvl and the otther team has maxed out everything best armor,cars,guns and then the actual system(im looking at you punkbuster) Kicks you because it basically wanted to. Finding allies is hard the only thing you can do later on is really hide in a corner till your character commits suicide
8426	0	a	Has the worst matchmaking i've ever seen
8769	0	a	You see a lot of the cool ads and all of the cool character customizations... when you get into the game all you get is confusion with no tutorial (or I didn't get any) and the game is just bland and boring.
5156	0	a	Horrible. Got banned for buying premium.  If you want to try it, get some premium codes and get a free week of premium, then try it. Otherwise - it's so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥. I got so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing angry when they banned me just after buying premium. It feels like the moderators or administrators are 10 years old. â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game. â¥â¥â¥â¥ it right up its money hungry â¥â¥â¥. It's like a blonde basic â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ - waste some money on her, then she leaves you. At least the sex was good.
10037	0	a	Well, wasn't that an utter waste of 8gig of data!!!
7706	0	a	Game sucked major â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ GG pay2win, would rather play Hello Kitty Online Adventures, save your life and desk space and dont even bother installing this â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. peace
1344	1	a	This is a good game for going around and doing all kinds of stuff killing people mugging civilians it is like a 13 year olds fantasy.
8132	0	a	Bad staff, and a game that's 70% problems
9244	1	a	relly like this game i recon you should try it cos moet likely u will like it
6355	0	a	the huge hype game that hyped itself to make a comeback with engine updates that never happened in years, people will buy pay2win weapons and spend a ton of money on cars even though they know that the game sucks and wont get an engine update.  sucks
9041	1	a	Before I start, let me say, yes this game isn't as good as it could be!  But it could be worse. To start, some of the major flaws are visable from the get go, lack of character slots, you want more then one character, buy slots, this itself is a huge turn off, and makes it seem like a demo for a pay once to play MMO. This honestly detered me from playing, but I decided to press on to see if it got better, and it did.....some what. While the skill system takes a moment to learn due to it's unfreindly new user interface, it's well designed once you get the hang of how it works.  The crafting systemis superb, while it is long, and a lot of the crafting times are broken, meaning they take more or less then what it says it will, only those who are really in to crafting will actually make use of this. All crafting skills have purpose, if you seek to play a more support role, medical and cooking skills will be of the most use to you. want a role to inflict maximum damage, science, ballistics and possibly nature (whick could also be put under support) would be a good suit for you. You can buy slots to have the ability to craft multiple items at once, and buy a device to speed up the crafting times all together. What more, the device can be bought from other players in game.  The ability to create camps, and material generaters gives this mmo a unique feel to it, making it seem more like a sand box game then an mmo. But this is also it's downfall, because it seem it can't decide if it wants to be an MMO or sandbox game, the AI seems unfinished and buggy, audio clips break at times, and enemy AI is flat out broken. But the broken enemy AI may also have been done on purpose, as even something one or two levels higher then you can easily come close to killing you, if you're not swarmed that is. Therefor, it's better to travel out in teams so you're not caught in a fray alone. Yes this game is Pay to Win, yes it has a lot of bugs and could be considered still in beta, but this game has merit, and tried to do something different.  If I had to rate this game, I'd give it a 8/10 something worth keeping regaurdless of the playerbase or cons, as this game could be easily fixed.

7785	0	a	It took me almost an hour to get this game to even work. When I finnally did get it working the 'next' boton was behind my start bar and unclickable. the window unsizable. Im sure it would be a great game if it was possable to actully get past the 'choose your faction' screen. at the very least make the window sizable or make the game full screen.

8498	0	a	Game was awesome, too bad it WAS... That was one of the best 3rd person shooter I have ever played, too bad this game is stucked at beta and its release date - 2011y... I have more than 12000h play off steam, max ranked, having collection of most legendary weapons, I havent payed a single cent for modifications, and im actually feeling good that i didnt putted any of my money into this game, gonna give some reasons... 1st things new players has to know - game is total P2W... If you are not going to pay money on this thing - you will regret starting playing this thing... If you are player that has bigger rank than 100 and you get gold, you gonna get f*cked up by c*nts that either cheat or are P2W, having all the weapons bought from G1M... 2nd thing would be stucking in 2011 year, in whole my huge gameplay experience i had only 1 patch, that added some new weapons, vehicles and some modifications in the game (Yes, Im talking about rising max rank until 255R and adding 2 new characters)... 3rd thing - they started nerfing legendary old school weapons like sitting ducks and ect., making to spend even more money on new legendaries or G1M shop, I totally do not support any of these things... 4th would be server instability, game had great stability until community started asking new anti cheating systems, that totally destroyed stability, and havent helped a bit from cheaters. 5th - unreasonable banning just because some ppl complained that you hack, just because they are better than reporters, thats how i got my 1st account banned - without evidences and stupid reasons... 6th would be hilariously stupid matchmaking and balances - Gold guys are playing in silver servers, silvers play in bronze, and bronze dont have where to run from silvers, the other thing would be about golden players 7th - gold players... If you got gold in game - you can say goodbye to game, because gold is the place where P2W and hackers plays, if you get there, prepare for the worst... I stopped playing this game and dont play it for &gt;1 year now, because i realised G1 cares only the smell of fresh earned dirty money... I totally DO NOT RECOMMEND SPENDING A SINGLE BUCK ON THIS CRAP, SO DEVS WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THE GOING TO LOSE ALL THE PLAYERS, AND I PERSONALLY HOPE IT WILL HAPPEN 1 DAY! Sorry if my review contain mistakes, nobody is perfect, but the game IS IN TERRIBLE CONDITION. -8/10
6680	0	a	start game rank you high look to buy a gun buy one gun perm $30 -10/10 dont feed their money hording.
5333	0	a	Ruled by hackers, laggy and Pay2Win, need I say more?
9992	1	a	Good game, kinda like fallout, i can see myself getting into it.
1153	1	a	Do you want aids? How about cancer? If so, download this game IMMEDIATELY! Kids will hackusate you all day, and will rage at you for doing something you are supposed to! This game has all in all made me love every gaming community so much more, just because the community in APB sucks so much! Thanks, APB!
939	1	a	Amazing game, Love it cant stop playing it. It is a lot better if you have a freind/freinds with you. Though still an amazing game I play as cop most (not alot of cop players) but not alot of things to do sadly  
10021	0	a	Having trouble linking it to Steam and I've reset my Steam password three times (which, with Authenticator every single time is a huge pain in the â¥â¥â¥). I've wasted two hours and a support ticket (with no response from the manufacturer).  0/5 stars. Even looking on thier gamersfirst.[com] forums, it seems like this has been a recurring problem since 2011.  Frankly, I'm so angry at a wasted evening at this point that I could spit.  I'd appreciate any advice.
2334	1	a	i cant seem to load it up 
3045	1	a	This is by far the greatest rage inducing game I have ever played. You can customize your character to look like just about anything, or make your character into your own unique personality. You can do this same with your vehicles. I have 750+ hours in this game, not just through steam. Most of it was spent customizing, just because you can get very detailed with it. If you have not tried this game, I highly recommend it, but be warned it is not easy and you will rage a lot.
1558	1	a	
180	1	a	The only game that made me uninstall itself. 100/10 Would uninstall again.  Okay just kidding.  This game is great with customization and everything. But all I'm asking for is a little performance fix. Sure, I may need to upgrade but, they should work on the performance more. Rarely, the game runs smooth but most of the time, it's just like watching slideshows. The game stutters A LOT... at least for most of the players, of course. And these stutters made us an easy target. Then get whispered 'noob', 'f****** n00b', and all the different versions of calling people noobs. And that's most of the community. Seriously. Optimize this game. Or at least try to.. or whatever.  But I still recommend it to people who has a lot of ram. There's tons of options for customizing your character, your vehicle, your kill theme. The game is basically a little GTA and a little Saints Row mixed together. So check it out. Das it mane.
4308	0	a	worst game ever,toxic community of â¥â¥â¥â¥ups

2326	1	a	Awesome game, funny to play, good staff , mixed things to do 10/10 ;)
1468	1	a	Cool
6303	0	a	Although this came can be fun at times, people rarely play it and its just filled with pay to win players
846	1	a	 TL:DR  Good game, community bandwagon raging about random stuff that doesn't exist as big as they make it sound   So there are a lot of people screaming 'Over powered gunz' and stuff like that, it's really kinda absurd. I played this game F2P for about a year before I bought Premium and I really haven't noticed a difference other than an XP boost and a few customization increases here and there, which I don't use because art to me may as well be a trashcan.  -Yes you can buy guns, are they more powerful? By default, yes. But they have massive draw backs and are really a case by case basis, and F2P guns that you can get can be modified to be more powerful than a paid gun.   -Is the community toxic? Yeah, kinda...A lot. You find a few snowflakes here and there who are nice.  -Population has been really good recently I personally haven't noticed a difference and I'm primarily on HAN, I still see people complaining but I'm willing to blame that on people jumping on the band wagon.  -Hackers? Not really..I've seen a total of 2, in about 3 years of playing, (Yes my hours are low, I played on and off for those years and originally started off with the standard APB launcher, instead of through Steam). Yes I understand they exist, but people say it's covered in hackers which I disagree with.  -Matchmaking. One thing I hear a lot is 'Match making iz broke'...It's really not, the game finds you a match based on the most suitable players, I'd rather get my â¥â¥â¥ kicked by some R255 then waiting 50 minutes for a match, and more often than not being paired against a R255 I can still hold my own meaning I'm getting paired with people of a similar skill level to me. Personally, I've rarely noticed the match making have any issues.  (I remember it used to have major issues, but they did fix that sometime this year, I think it was)  Overall this game is fun, it's well made, bugs are minimal and are patched quite quickly, I personally really enjoy what this game has to offer, I haven't been able to find a game similar to it and really enjoy it due to that.  Yes the Engine update is like..3 years late now? But really, I'd enjoy the engine update, but the game works fine so I see no issue.  There's so many things you can do within combat alone, depending on what enviroment your in and what weapon you're using as well as what faction. For example.  I play Enforcer, commonly less than lethal, now instead of killing people it tazes them, no it's not instant and it's a pain in the â¥â¥â¥ to do but it's fine, and once tazed you may arrest the criminal, keeping them in respawn for longer. Most commonly people will go Lethal, that's your shooty bullets that kill you, yes they hurt, and weapons in that category ranges from sniper rifles to machine guns to shotguns, the diversity of weapons is great.  Then there's the massive customization options, regarding vehicles &amp; players, even death music if you're that type of person, which I won't get to into because I'm a trash designer.  Finally your clans, you can get just your friendly clans or 'pro' clans, mostly always have some form of a symbol on them and roll around in force, which makes the game a lot easier for the people in clans as you aren't getting paired with randoms, and let's face it...Randoms aren't really people you wanna be with.  This game's 'Flaws' that the community rages about are blown out of the water, most players are just bad and blame it on hacks, or 'bugs' like most games.  I just edited this for the Steam badge Â¯\_(ã)_/Â¯
6079	0	a	Apb is a good game and fun I put more that 70$ on the game But today apb gave me account block or in other words, banned I never done cheats on the game  I never scam or anything els This week i got 4 permanent guns from joker boxes and now every thing that i put on the game is in the creators money and more that 600 hours  Was nice to play apb alot but im rly  Disappointed from the game...
4394	0	a	This game have the most unfair ranked missions ever 3 players top ranked vs 1 low ranked. and this happens al the time  gameplay 6/10. but because of the stupid unfair ranked match i give it 2/10 Don't waste your time on this game...
2792	1	a	This game is one of a kind.... But it runs out of fun after you get some good stuff 
10267	1	a	not to bad, but if your playing in a group its a pain in the A** to find them.
10158	1	a	Same as all free to play games.....WILL NOT START FFS 
10285	1	a	This games is a little hard to describe without saying the phrases 'Fallout 3', 'New Vegas', 'MMORPG', or 'Son of a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ I can holster HOW many weapons!?'   It certainly wasn't the game I was expecting, but it is the game I've been looking for, in a way. It's a perfectly/near-perfectly executed post-apocalypse MMORPG, and that's a rarity. My only complaints are that I found it looking for something else entirely, and that the story at the beginning reminds me of the early 90's Apoc D&amp;D settings. Otherwise, it gives you a horse two minutes in, something most MMORPGs take you days to get, and then they're usually expensive and just sort of bleh. In this case, I was just given a free horse, and it felt like it actually made sense. You're in a desert wasteland. Here, the one thing you need the most, in a desert wasteland.   And you can holster six weapons at once. I have a fireaxe, a rifle, two knives, and two pistols. I look like some sort of crazy gunslinger, and I'm not even an hour into the game!   Overall, as first impressions go, unless this game just suddenly becomes awful, this is probably the best MMORPG I've seen in years.
5045	0	a	This is the best time wasting game I have ever played. If you have a few hours to kill, you could do the tutorial and then just simply uninstall this game just like I did. The graphics are strong, but the game is lacking somewhat, far too much lag. I shot someone direct in the head, and they died 10 seconds later. They moaned first, then fell over, and then died, bluh.  Do yourself a favour and leave this game alone, it just ain't up to what it says on the tin. GTA wanabee, but GTA it will never be.
4200	0	a	Too Damn Laggy  Graphics must be fixed !
7206	0	a	This game has fun gameplay but the pay 2 win ruins it, if this game wouldn't be pay 2 win it would be pretty decent/semi-bad but it's not. are you skillful? this is not the game for you, are you good at spending TONS of mommys money to become an in-game stripper with rocket lauchers? download now for 'free'!
488	1	a	The original APB was a game that I always wanted to play as it had some excellent ideas that seemed really promising. The game iteself however was plagued with hackers and bugs. It died on its â¥â¥â¥â¥ rather soon after release, taking Realtime Worlds with it (no more crackdown :c ). What has this got to do with reloaded? Oh quite a bit. The game is now quite pay to win, with some guns only really available to people who pay the rough equivalent to a small island nation's GDP. The company who took ownership of APB, 'gamersfirst' have only started to get rid of some bugs that plagued the game since it was brought back and instead only really seemed to care about creating new 'premium' content instead of optimisation and stuff. The performance now is quite acceptable and as long as your pc isn't 32bit/very old/a laptop you should be able to run it. What really kills this game in terms of performance though is the servers. I don't know what potato they use to run their servers and internet, but it needs to be changed.  There are some bits that make it enjoyable though. One bit is the customisation, which is fantasic. The other bit is that if you play as a group you can have some fun annoying angry premium players, who will report you for hacking if you get more than three kills with the standard gun.   To conclude, I find this game incredibly easy to hate and wish for it to be put to death but at the same time I have many hours on it and its a laugh with friends to the point where I can almost overlook the half arsed job by gamersfirst.  IF THERE WAS A 'meh.' reccomendation I'd choose it :^)
6685	0	a	Fun to play but the launcher crashes so much you will rarely get to play
3861	0	a	Game is â¥â¥â¥â¥, it's slowly dying..  Don't belive me? Here take a look:  http://steamcharts.com/app/113400   GamersFirst will try to drag as many money out of the players, before they go under..  Please DO NOT spend any money on the game for a good amount of time. Please take time to talk to other players, preferably veterans, about the status of the game, the recent banning issues and how GamersFirst communicates with it's players.  So my Rating: 2/10 GamersFirst have ruined this game...  RIP APB 1987-2016 
4661	0	a	Have only played this game for 4 hours. (Played for over 2000 in 2009-2011).  THUMBS DOWN - why?  #1 - Punkbuster - I just got an email saying a My PUNKBUSTER BAN has been lifted and i am being given a second chance to return to APB. WTF??? What Punkbuster ban?  #2 - Pay to win.  #3 - Empty world. MAYBE 30-40 people in a district when it used to be 200.  #4 - Did i say Punkbuster and Pay to Win?  #5 - Too much P.
8794	0	a	Has something gta 5 dosent, blinkers. Other than that this game is terrible, stay the â¥â¥â¥â¥ away.
1923	1	a	I do recommend this game to all of you but i enden up playing it so much that i got banned, I was really good at the game and i would never intend to hack. But i only lost about 200 dollars and g1 gave me no refound so its okay i guess. Go ahead and try it the chance of being banned for not doing anything is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing tiny i have 10 alternative accounts :D
5334	0	a	Pay to win up the â¥â¥â¥. Community is filled with furâ¥â¥â¥â¥ and ERP cancer. Mods have no clue about what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ they're doing. Hackers on a daily basis.  10/10, it's okay.
4057	0	a	This game is broken... I downloaded the game off the official website and it would not let me launch it up. So i deleted the files and downloaded it off steam and yet again would not let me play. So i tryed to delete it again and it would not let me, even now as i write this review it says im playing APB, but i'm not. I dont know if this a common problem but personaly i am pretty disapointed.
7584	0	a	Positives:  &gt; Insane character and vehicle sustomization. Designing the charcter is quite fun. &gt; Frequent promotional stuff to keep you interested. (free premium account time)  Negatives: &gt; Persistent lag: This is the only reason why the game isn't playable for me right now. The lag is very frustrating and an unavoidable part of the game. The probability of lag is lower in low population servers(where there are like only 5 guys) But playing in low population servers means extremely long mission queues and low payots without opposition. It is no fun at all.
9246	0	a	another waste of time game
5392	0	a	OMG, what a TRASH game....  Hackers... Everyone Hacks, Snap to Target, insta kills, it's pathetic.  This game needs to be removed from steam.
4650	0	a	Usually I don't downvote on a game concept like this, but the gameplay APB:Reloaded offers is completely awful. Gunplay is terrible, you need to spend real money in order to keep the weapon forever, players equipped with a pistol can kill you in 2 shots, but it takes 20-30 shots to kill them with an assault rifle, (this is close combat), overall for gunplay...it's just...clunky and static. Servers always lag. Most players stay in the 'Social District'. There is matchmaking but you can choose either to go into a Matchmaking PVP District, or No-Matchmaking PVP District. Surprisingly, rarely anyone plays in the Matchmaking PVP Version of a District. Driving a car is like driving a stick of butter, or driving a brick. You can customize cars and clothes as much as you want. Clothes in the market, created by other players will usually cost a lot of in-game money, around 100k when each mission you play against other players, will only give you 500 in-game money or lower. Completely it's a pay-to-look cool/win, mixed with bad game mechanics.   I like the game concept, but the ways done in the game...are just laggy and boring after a while.
5144	0	a	I put up with this b******* of a game for months i gave it a good chance I tried to make to seem good but as hard i tried this is a bad game,hackers Fairfight didnt do anythings this game tries to get u to open ur wallet more time that Steam Summer Sale (That is not possible though). If I had to Summirse i would say its a s***,broken version of GTA
4904	0	a	I can't do much of a review game never truly launched. I use windows 7 professional 64x. Pro free Con wasted about 90 minutes trying to get to play it.
6336	0	a	Oh dear god... this game.  It's so bad I can barely keep looking at it for even 10 seconds.  It's gameplay is terrible, graphics don't even bloody stand out, and the economy is TOO DAMN EXPENSIVE.  I can buy a HAUNTED HAT FOR A SIMPLE 1 DAY T-SHIRT.  Come with me, Haunted Hat, this game is 2shiz4me
6460	0	a	well I don't know because the game won't start, tired everything even contacted steam but it won't work. I can't help it, I don't really like the game cause I have spent so many frustrating hours on it. post if you are having the same problem.
1534	1	a	COOL GAME LIKE GTA 5

2098	1	a	My game is broken but i have played it before and its realy good. 
3487	1	a	how do you get to play the game!? 
14	1	a	Good game, stressful at times.
6709	0	a	Cant even figure out how to beat the tutorial  -10/10
472	1	a	I wasn't sure what to think of this game when I first picked it up. Interesting idea, but there was/is a bit of lag at times, and a ton of cheatin' hackers. However looking past that, as soon as they patch to the new Unreal engine which will solve those issues, the games definitely a good one if you want to play a MMOFPS game. Even though the population is a bit small, the size of the maps is big enough not to feel crowded, yet small enough you don't have to travel far to find something being blown up or someone to shoot. All in all 8/10 imho.
7362	0	a	this game you cant even open i dont recommend it 
5394	0	a	Never again
3842	0	a	So first off I actually started playing this game 6 years ago, but only connected it to Steam recently so that's why my play time is only said to be 100 odd hours. Now honestly I didn't play for all of those 6 years and for the reasons I am about to cover... The game has some heavy pay to win issues, now some people (usually those who pay actually...) defend the game and say that if you earn enough 'joker tickets' you can buy these OP premium weapons for 7 days. The problem I'd argue is that it takes about a week for doing specific missions known as 'fight club' missions to actually achieve the joker tickets necessary in the meanwhile you are facing off against opponents whom oay for premium weapons and I have always played without paying any money so I can most defintley confirm that premium weapons absolutley out class their standard counter-parts and only after heavy modification after loads of playing time can one even stand on the same level as a premium weapon. Of course natrually a premium assault rifle will still lose out to a standard shotgun at point-blank range assuming the shotgun is being used well as it is not unheard of for a shotgun to lose in this scenario. I have played with the regular weapons then one-day trialed their premium counter-parts and it is very easy to notice the difference.   Another issue is that the community are generenally â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, like if you've ever thought a community in a game like LoL is bad then wait till you see APB. But yeah people won't be kind to you. Also this has been massively improved upon (as once this was literally no exaggeration a problem every other match in a standard district) but there is still the occassional hacker that ruins the game. But I am thankful as this is way less common than before.  On the flip-side the customisation is better than any game I have ever seen ever and I do love it. It is incredibly in-depth and you can truly create your own identity, both in your character and vehicle. However once more customisation is better with premium allowing you to obtain a few more pieces of gear that are usually impossible to get due to pricing and also more decals are allowed on you and your gear and vehicles if you are a premium member.  Also I generenally find the combat fun, hit detection can be quite bad. But if you aren't playing against a load peeps using premium weapons, which makes up a large amount of the community, then it is quite fun and skill based. But as I said no matter how skilled you are your assualt rifle will lose out to a premium assualt rifle at almost any range. Except there does exist the odd bad premium weapon.  Overall I wouldn't recommend. Unless like me you love customisation and the game can be very fun, it has a few interesting gameplay features/ the game just feels unique in it's gameplay despite just being a third person shooter. But if you play for free you'll find yourself heavily disadvantaged and will recieve slightly limited customisation options. Having said that the customisation is still truly amazing and it's weird to think that a not so good game can nail one mechanic so much better than any other I've ever seen.
1695	1	a	MONSTER NICE ! CUSTOM CUSTOM CUSTOM EVERYTHING IS CUSTOM!!! :DDD
9975	0	a	While a noble concept and interesting lore this falls incredibly short due to clunky controls and mechanics. Luckily this was free otherwise I'd be pulling my hair out now....
6861	0	a	Avoid this game like the plague. The shooting mechanics are horrible, and the objective fighting is bland. For something that shouts out MMO GTA it just feels empty as hell, with the largest battle I had being two versus two. SHIITTTTT
15	1	a	Having been riding shotgun on this rocky slope since the engine first breathed life, I've bared witness to the rise and fall of many events both majestic and miniscule. From the very beginning, connecting across the ocean to the Real Time Worlds European server to participate in the closed beta program through one scheduled hour a week, I felt that there was something metaphysical at work. Something without form, without function, sleeping beneath the silver sheen of this seemingly genre changing cops and robbers MMO.   There was something there behind the flying bullets, the untapped expression of creativity driven forth from every player, the static walls of San Paro and it's fleeing citizens. Like a father watching his infant son strike his first fluke homerun well out of the confines of the park, I remember excitedly tossing and considering the possibilities of a game like APB. It was destined for many things, much of which can only be described as allegory in light of the failed future this game was given by fate.   The son that knocked the ball out of the park, he could have been in the Major Leagues. He could have been so much more. Instead, somewhere between that first fluke shot and college, he found drugs and greed and turned that bat into a tool of violence for the dealer that provided him with his fix. The story of APB, sadly, is not that much different.  I stand now with a precious handful of survivors that took the train and never got off, and it is from this seat that I can humbly nominate APB Reloaded for the 'Monument To What Could Have Been' award.    Nothing further, your honor.
861	1	a	Great..
5126	0	a	When updating this game my disk usage is at 100%.   this program is 7GB of adds and background progams running at all times.    10/10 background apps
9701	1	a	cool
6735	0	a	APB is â¥â¥â¥â¥.
7882	0	a	Its a free to play game, it's the same as all the others.
10845	1	a	Never thought I'd actually like this game. It's really good with gameplay even if it is all pixelated.
2404	1	a	use Apeed Volcano JC + Oca Nano    -Ezy win ezy life
4291	0	a	Pay2Win system of weapons
9036	1	a	Rough around the edges, but I find that endearing. Solid RPG elements such as character progression, crafting, and skills, nice apocalyptic theme, and good support make this a very enjoyable free2play action RPG. You must give this a try, especially since it's free.
5673	0	a	The game wont even â¥â¥â¥â¥ing start up for me 
7387	0	a	3 Words can discribe this game Pay 2 Win.. No really it's a P2W game and the weapons they sell are extreamly expensive and as far as I can tell the Devs favor on the Criminal side duo to some seriouse unbalance LTL weapons that take 8 hits just to stun a person but it takes 3 hits with a normal weapon to kill you seems a little on the BS side if you tell me. I would not bother downloading the game
9391	1	a	the naked caterpillar. what more do you want from a game?
10297	0	a	This game is NOT what the pictures look like. Sure it LOOKS fun but it really isnt. SO glad this game is free to play.
10727	1	a	Nice indie-game so far.
9410	0	a	Logged in for the first time and spawned underground and i was stuck there.   0/10 can't even get as simple as this working.
7824	0	a	A glorified, pay to win version of cops and robbers in which to kill someone you have to run around like a madman and throw explosives at anything that moves. also, your guns do as much damage as flicking a pea.
5849	0	a	Another one of those pay to win games.
9071	1	a	This game is not bad bad by any means, but it's not Fallout. If you found this and are hoping for a Fallout-MMO, then you'd be sadly mistaken. I haven't spent much time on this game, mainly because it's a bit tedious to actually get started playing it. If you have some free time, and you're looking for a new game to try out then go ahead and download this one. I feel that once you start progressing into the game, it just continues to get better and better as you go. I give Fallen Earth a 7/10.
4062	0	a	This game is good, but we want to costum must buy -_-
1626	1	a	it ascn very nocie
10518	0	a	you cant realy do anything without paying a bunch of money to buy things... not a good game
2399	1	a	kinda bad graffics but good game play
6254	0	a	i'm ABSOLUTELY not recommend this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game, cause: i was on lvl 20 and the game dropped me with much higher lvl players (over lvl. 150) . The players playing like 6 yrs old kids.. : shoots their teammate, can't play in a â¥â¥â¥â¥in' team..  WORTH MMO IN THE WORLD
1232	1	a	LOVE this game played it for a while but i stopped i think you should make it less pay to win :D.
10346	1	a	Great Game! Lots of story, gameplay, and awesome players who will help you out along the way! I wish there were a few more options to reduce lag though.
10105	1	a	this is a good action and aventure game for people who like killing stealing and dieing
6514	0	a	Pay2Win always throws away any value or fun, don't get this game unless you can bother to spend lots of cash.
2403	1	a	Very fun game, sometimes the premiums and hackers can be asses, but all in all it's a recommendable game for friends to play ^^
6026	0	a	Words cnat even describe how pay to win this is, but I can try.  First off it is important to note that the 'tutorial' the game gives you is little mpore than some stuff that you need to do, but it doesnt really say how and while you do it, your not in a seperate part of the game like most mmo's, no you are in the game, with no clue what to do.   Expect to have to pay a lot of gold to get anything in this game, although some cheap weapons are decent, the only last for 7 days, that is right, you have to buy new weapons every 7 days. Anything that is permanent like guns or cars, will cost you lots of money.  The whole G1C thing really ticks me off, its a premium currency used that you have to buy, (or earn in painfullly small amounts) that can buy the best of everything.   Matchmaking is broken, new players vs old, 5 v 2, etc   Story is almost nothing, imagine a quilt with 5 patches that are decnt looking, but they are all spread apart and sewn together using a dark brown thread that makes it look ugly.  Honestly, when i got this game, i saw the bad reviews and thought 'Whatver, this game looks awesoeme!', and even though i started with no expectations, somehow, this bundle of steaming horse crap has gone below my lowest expectations. Do not play this game, please, just trust me.  Overall -10/10
7101	0	a	It's â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t.
5648	0	a	THIS GAME IS â¥â¥â¥â¥ -10/10 i have a really good pc and it stills lags it didnt lag wen i played on my old pc windows xp
1	1	a	I recommend this game for every masochist! APB:Reloaded features: - Crappy perfomance - Crappy servers - Crappy GMs - Idiots - Hackers - Pay to win After 2600 hours, I still can't stop! ( Help! )
3852	0	a	APB:R What can i say this game is a guilty pleasure of mine BUT there are sooo many broken mechanics to the game so lets name a fiew -Matchmaking is â¥â¥â¥â¥ -all sweet items are locked off to high ranks -Extermely harsh on new players  -Cheap weapons  -G1C  i gotta say The premium feature broke it for me,locking off most of the bigger features of customization off to new players is just cheap and feels like 'HEY THIS GAME IS â¥â¥â¥â¥,LETS MILK MORE CASH OUT OF IT' the new publishers are just being â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ milking the cash cow all day i wouldnt have a problem if i wouldnt be getting ranked with golds on bronz and silver dics (I myself am bronze) And i think its Unair that a 255 can get into a bronz disc where there will be people ranking from 1 to 100 ,it makes it unfair and not fun getting into a game where your team is completely made from new players and the other team is made from 255s and golds, i think they should you make a level lock on bronz servers,once you hit 200 thats it you cant enter bronze servers anymore,ive been helping my friend getting into the game but as always its hard as hell getting a player who only has 20 hours on the game to get intrest init with a broken as crap matchmaking system,at least rank it by the levels or as my previus idea lock off 255s from bronze servers,i know some APB:R vets and some think i got a point others think my struggle is usles in some point it is but its stupid  What i think this game needs are some changes,changes for the better  These changes are: -Make all customization options for all players (Free and prem) -Make G1C items cheaper(Im not paying 14 bucks for a perm gun that i wouldnt even like at the end) -a way to make g1c in game from playing it or a weekly reward of 10 to 5 G1C -Free goodies and weapon rewards from mission drops -Matchmaking where ranks ranging from 50 to 60 would get matched but ranks like 10 againts 255 wouldnt -Make a permanent block on all 200+ players on bronze servers 
9733	0	a	This game shouldn't be free to play, it's so bad that they should have to pay you to play it
3894	0	a	22 minutes 'played' yet unable to even start the game or register a user or redeem my bought code
1166	1	a	Hands down, my favorite MMO. Tons of action, great customization abilities, awesome gameplay. And yes, it may be rampant with hackers, but it's still tons of fun to play
7224	0	a	After 5 years the game still has delays that exist for no reason and you can still shoot through walls.
10561	1	a	you like dying? this game is for you
4769	0	a	DO NOT GET THIS GAME!!!!! It is just not fun when you can't firstperson or have to walk all the way across the city. There are probably 10 car in the game and most suck at driving. I'm going to leave it there.
6804	0	a	have a lot of drive lag !
319	1	a	Very fun game,especially if you're in a clan of cool people.It has some cons though: -Servers usually lagging -Some hackers -Really hard to get into especially if you're alone,it is NOT an easy game  But it has lots of cool features: -Big maps with detailed environnements and a feeling of living city (with players+npcs) -A looooot of weapons you can get -Not p2w at all,you can beat a premium or legendary gun user with a free gun -A quite good community (of course there are some idiots but its a minority)ready to help most of the time  YES,i recommend this game,if you're ready to get into,do it,its free! :)
10677	1	a	This game is amazing now that Deca has taken over! They should even consider improving the starter pack dlc to boost sales, as well as give the players a LOT of interesting perks and goodies to play around with. Free customization for the players anyone? How about a cute-looking Robot Tank based off of Steam itself?
10703	1	a	Hahaha. I'm surprised to see this on Steam, considering it was originally a little in-browser thing. It's an amusing little waste of time, probably won't hold your attention for too long, but... it's fun for what it is, so go ahead and check it out if you've got a few hours to kill.
4791	0	a	Short and simple, about nothing in the game actually works  Being said, the game has been out for years and still has server and possible optimization issues  Besides the technicals, driving is fairly dreadful and the gunplay for the most part isn't much better  Missions are fairly run of the mill and will expect a lot of camping or just annoyance that the enemy has a better gun for the situation  It is however an excellent fashion simulator if you have the time to put up with the rest of the game
8697	0	a	You will encounter pro players if you are new in game, those players have plenty of premium and P2W weapons you dont stand a chance and thats why this game is dying all new players, are rage quitting because of that, the devs dont care about it because all the Golds are paying in $ Gold/premium hackers are not getting banned, they get supported by game masters.  roughly 54% of the players are hackers, 30% are Pro players and clans and all the rest are randoms and noobs.   gold players play on silver servers to pwn the regular players, the silvers are mad and play on bronze servers because they are tired of getting owned by golds and the bronze players and trainee players are getting pwnd by both and thats why they are leaving this unfair game, you shoud NOT download this game until they fix it or you will have a very frustrating/painful and hard start into this game, which means you are forced to go this way because they will NEVER fix this issue.
9643	0	a	Terrible... This game has lag, poor character movements, and not enough of a character setting. I recommend you get TERA instead that game is so mch better
8989	1	a	I found lag to be the greatest downer.  Other than that the environment is fully immersive and the storyline extensive; though familiar. You can stay on point and do quests, or venture off and level up in the desert on your own; to a certain degree, in that you'll have to sell loot eventually. After crafting two lawnmower blades into dual-weild weapons I had the most fun.  NOTE:I live in the area it is set in and they got our night sky, the star constellations, right. That's one heck of a detail.
4579	0	a	I have played this god forsaken for hours, hours, ive spent an ungodly amount of money on this game. Because that is practically the only way to do good in this game. The community of this game is absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ full of awful people. If you are actually good at third person shooters then do not get this game. You will constantly be called a hacker. You will eventually get banned just as i have, and in return lose everything youve worked for. I was max rank with everything unlocked and i payed the price for being accused a hacker. I know sit at home staring at my screen wishing that i could punch the C.E.O of Gamersfirst in the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing face. This Game's Community, and EVERYTHING it stands for is absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥!
5570	0	a	Well, this game is at the start damn hard, after 4 or 5 hours you'll it's starting be be nice but than... You'll see that this is totaly Fu cked up, Pay2Win, BUT, you also can play with some redeem codes realy well at the start. It's not the best game but also not the worst GTA knock off, Watch_Dogs is worse than that. But, the commiunety is full of As s holes! You want to play a mission 'n win that damn missions, and Your own Team mates are killing You cuz You want to win the mission 'n earn money 'n help 'em. -10/10.
2116	1	a	I played in the Original BETA with RealTime Worlds. This version KICKS MORE ASSSS!!! Play it. Come onto Server: Patriots EU2
210	1	a	Its a pretty cool game if you look beyond all the technichal issues.
189	1	a	One of the most entertaining games i have seen in years. lots to do, you can do missions with friends, or just mess around!
8255	0	a	Pay to win.
4546	0	a	The game itself is GOOD. But if you don't have the time to grow a thick skin and overcome a steep learning curve, you will not enjoy it, and you should likely not bother.  I'm NOT recommending this game until some major change will transform the game into something better. I would love so much to do it, but I don't feel like I should right now.  Update from Nov 18th 2015 - meh, still not that much of an improvement. Still a harsh game to learn, still requires to be thick-skinned. If you don't take it seriously you can still have fun, though.
3124	1	a	Launcher has lots of errors
3379	1	a	played for 10 minutes.  10 minutes trying to get the game to launch 0 playing  10/10 launcher simulator

5189	0	a	I was told once i'm Hacker beacuse i killed some guy with my luck. This game is actually Pay to Win, if you have money. But better don't play it in this status. Not recommended at all.
3207	1	a	Fun game espiaclly with lots of friends
534	1	a	If you can get past the lag spikes, and the occasional hacker. This has to be one of the best open world MMO/PvP games I've ever played. The customization in this game is brilliant. It is still a very much work in progress as far as games go, but it gets better and better.
8747	0	a	This is everything wrong with free to play games

1846	1	a	Im making my way downtown.....*gets rammed by a freindly car*....friend enters cars and says:' Why dont you go?'....and i just look at my totaled car and say:'Get the F*** out of my mother f****** face you fake police officer'....and then we get blown up by a criminal....the vicious cycle of APB!
9665	0	a	Game would not open , never received email validation after three attempts . The Game never worked for me. Thumbs down for me.
3987	0	a	Not worth your time at this moment.
6025	0	a	My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway. i know this review was harsh but never for the love of god play it 
9567	0	a	 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AldUzWWq8iQ  10/10 would not play this game
8278	0	a	Game used to be good now its pay to win and Full of Hackers...Now that is is going to be released on PS4 and XboxOne forget about playing PC version the Devs have given up and most of the time FairFight doesnt do anything about the Hackers..
6367	0	a	.
2873	1	a	I like tha game....kinda like GTA but its not at the same time.
5446	0	a	This game has a great potential to be a fun little distraction, when having flashlights and lasers shone into your eyes is too 'realistic' for you, or when WoW is too 'click-to-win' for your taste.  Mixing MMO and TPS in a pretty strange mix, the action, customization, and open world feel you can find in this game have impressed me. For a free to play, pay to win game it turned out to be rather enjoyable even without transactions.  However, the only reason I can NOT recommend trying this game, is its match making system. You, as a new player, must not only understand your chosen role, criminal or enforcer, but also your role as fodder. The match maker feeds you to higher levels quite readily, and to make sure you, as the fodder, can't leave the trough it drops you into, you are not permitted to leave a mission once you've been pulled into it.  Feeding higher ranks isn't avoidable. You have cheap guns and no armor, they have very powerful guns and armor that grants them greater health than you. In a CQC fight between yourself, wielding an SMG made for CQC, and a high level enemy, wielding a high power rifle made for sniping, the higher level will win due to the fact their armor soaks your bullets, and your lack of armor doesn't soak their far stronger bullets.  Ultimately, the choice you must decide on before you pick up this game is this: Do you want to be a feeder, or do you want to be a competitor? If you chose the latter, hit the back button on the store browser and find another free game.
2539	1	a	I got this game, and made an account to play it, but when i got on to try and play the game, it said that i was not old enough to play. seeing as i am 21, i am really confused as to why the game thinks i am not old enough. is there a way to fix this?
7875	0	a	Major hackfest + pay to win in every way possible, it used to be a great game but the devs got greedy... avoid at all costs if you wish to keep your sanity in check.
7778	0	a	Used to be a fun game, now it has become a p2w.
4439	0	a	This game has NO GM present at any time
9117	1	a	This game is fun, especialy for those how like post apocalyptic survival kinda games. You basicly go around doing missions from npcs and craft weapons, armor, vichles, etc. Theres alot of wierd creatures in the world that you can kill and harvest after, moast of them are mutants or npc bandits.  Don't wory about getting killed and losing your stuff because moast of the map is pve, but you still have to whatch out for agressive npcs. The ones you enconter in the first town are quite weack but every town you go to the npcs are stronger and cooler, so i advise you to craft the best armor and weapons possible in every town you go.  Over all it's a really fun game and will entertain you until you get bored of it and find a new one. Because has we all know thats how games work.
3121	1	a	pritty fun game reminds me of gta 5
122	1	a	The game mechanics are good, but the best thing about it is how much idiotic fun it is with friends. A large part of the enjoyment comes from goofing off with friends and just not taking it seriously. I highly recommend this game if you want some good fun with your friends. And it's free, so you can't beat that.
3432	1	a	love this game
401	1	a	I would really recommend this game because it is very fun and very addicting. The game does have a few bugs and gliches in which the game might start to lag out or freeze completely but over all it is a very good game. A addicting and challenging one with a comptetitive twist. Game on.
1099	1	a	Grab ur friends and play as criminals or enforcers.

8496	0	a	This honestly has to be the most nonsensical game Ive ever played. The gun damage makes 0 sense whatsoever. You hit a guy with an AK 15 times and he survives, and he shoots you 3 times with a pistol and you die. Whoever is defending is guaranteed to win every mission. I havent won a single mission where Im not defending, and havent lost a single mission where I am. This games 'skill' is purchased in the form of better equipment, that you cant buy until youre a high level. #hide2win
2817	1	a	the best f2p i ever played,its a gta style based mmo,wich will grant endless hours of fun for the lovers of the style. the costumization is awesome,wich gice u the power to make very cool distinct chars or vehicles,etc... have its flaws,and requires a powerfull pc to play even in lowest settings,but the size of the worlds and the concept manage to keep the game interesting and fun.  i have 4 chars 2 accounts,and more then 2000 hours combined,it says alot about the game. im a gta lover,and this is the ultimate multiplayer for playas like me. at least till something can compete with it.  many will say its a pay to win game,but i have several premium weapons,and none of them is so overpowered like some people try to pass the image. btw if u wanna try premium search for the real retail pack in the web,will give u a premium primary weapon account lifetime,premium side arm,premium car,500g1 and 30 day premium account (wich allows to win money faster,and wider costumization) if u buy the rt1 (retail pack) check utube videos t see wich weapon is best for u. the normal player preference is (scout,csg,whisper,ntec) by the order i putted.  its very hard game to enter,with a long learning curve,but after u manage to pass that part,will become a game that u will return over and over again. a must have,and one of the best f2p in present time in my humble opinion. peace.
6588	0	a	no its awful
3302	1	a	I found it to be very fun and enjoyable, the game dose not offer as much (if any) realism as other shoters, howerver its the content and the great custimazability that makes this game so great and highly adicting. If you want to try a new type of shooter with great possibilitys than try apb and find yourself glued to the screen!!!!

4173	0	a	Im sick of these games, i aint gonna act like the rest of these reviewers acting like they are actually critics. What im gonna do is tell the truth. APB Reloaded is awful, the only reason its actually fun is to either troll or screw up the terrible physics engine, you go around in a dump truck and crush a player's cars and killing them, which is very fun, this aint no GTA rip off, it dosent even deserve that title, its a pay to win cash fest, buy a gun= real money, buy a car= real money, hell there is even gambling with real money! You go to a contract and then they give you a mission, its always the same, either bomb a car, steal a car or kill the enemy or graffiti some walls for some reason! Some missions no enforcers actually attack you, in some missions they do. And this is where the fun begins *sarcasm* the balance system sucks so much it could swallow a blue whale, it literally pairs you up with morons who just started the game, and the enemy are silver players with the best guns in the game, basically the game was pretty fun, untill it became pay 2 win, first started the OP guns, HEY PLAYERS PAY Â£40 FOR A GUN THAT KILLS IN 2 HITS! The game can sometimes be fun, but after a couple of hours it becomes incredibally boring and you wonder what would happen if this game wasent free? Maybe more gamemodes, maybe more stuff, maybe some actual fun. Oh yeah, this game isent cops and robbers, the enforcers get the same guns as the criminals, they have different names but they do the same â¥â¥â¥â¥, you go around in free roam and you cant start a police chase, the only time a cop can attack you is if they see you pick up a item that dosent belong to you (ram raid) and then it makes you go into this minigame where you have to put the evidence in a place and so does the cops, also the bag of evidence makes a sports car turn into a segway so good luck with that. The game would be alot more fun if the cops could actually do cop stuff, like arresting you, they should be able to spot you then have to arrest you for extra money and you go into this L.A Noire interrogation minigame, NOW THAT WOULD BE FUN, but nope the only way they can arrest you is if they stun you and arrest you then you disapear and respawn lol. 35/100 (btw if you want some real money, wait at a contract place for a ram raider to arrive to sell his stuff then steal his van full of items :D)
5669	0	a	Mediocre game. I don't realy like it. But it's free so go check it out i guess...

8629	0	a	This game is an awesome idea,but there is just too many mistakes made in it.  First of all its complicated,atleast it was for me. No real tutorial rather than text. Pro players in starter area. Glitches. Pay to win.
6576	0	a	If you like repetitive gameplay or GTA-style PvP this is the game for you otherwise, run for your life!  It's fun Co-Op game to play with friends other than that it's pretty bad. 
6599	0	a	great game, or atleast if would be if it wasnt pay to win and stuck on a rent system with your gear. i dont like having to re purchase guns because i cant play regularly to keep them from expiring
5564	0	a	Every time I play this game, I feel a tickle in my taint. So I guess this game is comparable to gonorrhea.
675	1	a	...!
8139	0	a	Truely awful. You will just die, and die, and die by simply overpowered players that have put their money into the grind machine to quickly unlock the best possible weapons that will one shot you before you can blink. No tutorial that I noticed, and no match making, just thrown into a mess. Appalling game.
4983	0	a	Pay2Win Garbage, after many attempts and after buying weapons with in-game cash, the quality was very poor.  Stunning bullets are OP as hell and need real money to buy, at all costs, AVOID this game.

5674	0	a	this 'amazing' gta/saints row clone is boring as crap. the cars handle poorly, you cant just kill who ever you want,the missions, god, the missions are just copy and paste robberies over and over again, oh and to get better stuff you need  purchase the 'full review' pack for only 5.99!
605	1	a	Pros+++ +Character creation. +Customization. clothes,vechile,songs,etc. +Decent graphics. +Vehicles. +Lot of challenge. (Its not enough u know how to aim, u cant just run centre of street!) +Can find kind player too, true nerds, u can even buy zelda songs!  Cons--- -Matchmaking!! (U have to join bronze district if u silver or lower threat!) -Toxic/cheating community like most of competive games. -Devs dont to right thinks to improve game. -Some of guns are bit p2w. -Sometimes game lag when it get ddosed. -Car spawnz are op! -Fog of war. -No headshots. -Mission reward low without premium.  Still better game than cs go.
8767	0	a	Your Amd graphics will not work on this game, even if it's a powerful Pc. They only accept Intel, game will stutter and be unplayable in close combat.

3605	1	a	This game is great! I love companies who make us wait 7 months for their promised engine updates! If you like waiting, this is DEFINITELY the game for you! GamersFirst promised an engine update by the end of Summer 2015, and now it's February 2016! I love it! I really hope they don't make us NOT wait! It's the best part of the game! GamersFirst really knows how to treat 'gamers first'! TL; DR BEST WAITING GAME OF ALL TIME!

7266	0	a	I did a previous review explaining why this was still a good game and delved into the issues with hackers and defended this company and game full heartedly. I then got false banned for 'hacking' under the new FairFight anticheat system, along with many others.   This was just another slap in the face by the ironically named 'Gamers First' company. Literally no proof is needed to be banned; so play this at your own risk because you are guaranteed to be an ignored, unvalued player.  I suggest that if the same thing has happened to you, consider filing a complaint against them to the BBB, they might still get away with it for now but eventually action will have to be taken. This is not okay and this company is scamming players.
3261	1	a	great game
6234	0	a	For the love of god, don't do missions. In my experience there's a lot of P2W out there. Although the customization and the worlds are great, the PvP makes ArcheBlade look easy.

6533	0	a	I have decided to not to recommend this game to any of my freinds. The reason lies within the game itself. The terrible community(people constantly calling you names if you win or lose). Terrible matchmaking. At the start of the game you will face people like you, noobish etc, but a few more matchmaking games and boom! You are faced with enemies with Pay2win guns, better skill and level, hackers, or just dumb â¥â¥â¥â¥ing trolls. You will feel overwhelmed with either anger wanting to throw your computer out the door, laptop on the floor. Wanting to kill the enemy team. Or sadness that you downloaded this game. This game does show some promise but it is lost. The lag was so bad I had to turn of my computer or stop playing. If you want to save yourself the money and space on your computer you will not download this game. AND I WILL TELL YOU NOW DO NOT, AND I MEAN DO NOT BUY ANY GUNS.
1755	1	a	Take Grand Theft Auto V. Take 20 - 30% of the features out. Make it slightly more complicated. And BOOM! You've just made APB Reloaded.
1004	1	a	dont know but when i download it, it says its done but ALWAYS stops installing at 5-20 seconds left
8237	0	a	The biggest pay to win I've ever experienced... Â£24 for a CAR! 1 CAR!! Do not download this, it's simply not fun at all and the developers beg for money so much. Avoid at all costs!
9126	0	a	This is a terrible and boring game. Full of Hackers and annoying bugs.   Ignore this game and go play Fallout or something.
999	1	a	Awesome game but if they could make the requirstemt little lower for lower pc or laptops.
6138	0	a	This game is worse than giving birth to a fully sized man,everyone is generic fagot no.1 with a white wife beater on.The gun play is â¥â¥â¥ cuz you have generic pea shooter one and some kid whop got his mothers paypal can one shot you with some 5 dollah gun.theres nothing to do in this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥,after ten minutes of playing I was contemplating suicide.If you have no dollah and want to play something worse that rough anal with a door knop then I advice to try out this pay to win musical produced by the one and only steam free to play section.   P.S guns don't penetrate glass windows,players,nps,or your own â¥â¥â¥â¥ing skull once you try to end it all :( 7/11 Ign would un install again
651	1	a	Not revamped, not rejigged, not redesigned. Reloaded. APBâs new suffix is apt, as this free-to-play reincarnation of 2010âs deflated cops and robbers MMO is a retread of the same ground. The same drab city, the same hollow combat, the same lopsided results. The original city of San Paro has been left standing, a monument to badly judged level design and the colour grey. The first gameâs devs, Realtime Worlds, intended the place to live and breathe. Instead, it spluttered a few times before its life support failed. Its resurrection is a miserable one. Reloadedâs missions usually pit two small squads of human-controlled criminals and enforcers against each other, asking them to perform a multi-stage series of mini-jobs. One team has to drive to a place, collect a thing, and deliver it somewhere else. The other team has to stop them. Occasionally this leads to the kind of scenes that flicker through the minds of non-players when you describe APB to them: high-speed chases through busy streets, lastsecond jumps into getaway cars. Most of APBâs problems remain in Reloaded. It even inherited a few new ones, as it is currently seeded with cheaters. The original game was arguably killed too soon, so the switch to free-to-play means interested parties should at least take a weekend city break back to San Paro. But this is no revitalisation â APB Reloaded is rehash, replication, and repetition.

7319	0	a	the game is really fun but its ruined by how badly they want you to spend real money on the game. in order to get anything decent or cool you need to pay money for god damn points. you can only have 2 decals on your car if u want more u need to pay. character stuff u need to pay. f that. basically this game should be called money waster simulator. if they get rid of the money and make a way to get those stuff then 8/10.

5397	0	a	A really awesome concept, but just done really bad. Its still fun to play, but if you want to do actual missions and stuff then you will have to atleast pay a dollar to get a gun that DOESN'T to the equivalent damage of shooting paper clips covered in feathers at people.  However, I will say that the overall customization of everything is the best I have seen in a LONG time.
5496	0	a	Game is terrible , I forgot what Ragequitting was until I played this game .Matchmaking is beyond broken ,the missions in this game are repititive and dumb as Sh*t(Vip Missions).This game gets updated frequently and yet 4 years later still running into the same problems.If 'Gamer'sFirst' Couldn't fix it 4 years back they sure as hell can't fix it now.   Bottom Line I DO NOT reccomend this game to anyone.
1733	1	a	Simplistic and pay to win version of gta but free and potentially fun.

914	1	a	Even if it's not the action that keeps you playing, just messing around in the social district and designing logos, tattoos and whatnot can be reason enough to dl this title. LOVE IT

259	1	a	If you didn't get what you excepted from GTA Online. This game is freaking perfect for you. It's way much better than GTA Online. First of all, It's open world in a server for 90 players. There are 5 different maps(excluding special maps for special days). There are so many online things you can do in the offline mod of GTA series. You should definitely give it a shot.

8533	0	a	A great game with amazing customization that is a way smoother, better GTA Online.  APB: Reloaded is a repetitive game that you never just kind of get bored of, since its never just killing each other, you will always be tasked to defend/attack/capture an objective. Every mission you play is different, each team will affect how the mission progresses, for example, if your team has anti vehicle weapons, and the enemy team has to deliver cars, you will have a way higher chance of winning that stage of the mission. Using the right type of guns in the right situation will greatly affect how the match progresses.  Missions with multiple players are always chaos, as players with rockets launchers and light-machine guns come after your â¥â¥â¥, other players out of your mission hurry to their mission, and on their way, crash to your car causing your car to flip and forcing you to continue on foot. Many things can affect your mission in a positive or  negative way. San Paro is absolute CHAOS.  Pros and Cons  Pros: - A great Grand Theft Auto like PVP game - Amazing customization (cars, players, clothes, guns, symbols) - A very unique type of game that you HAVEN'T seen before. - Many ways to play the game - Free to play - Very smooth gameplay - Doesn't get boring after thousands of hours of gameplay - Very fun to play with friends (not as fun alone..)  Cons: - Armas Marketplace (You can buy ingame stuff with real money,  prizes are ridiculously high and they should rather be unlockable through ingame progression)   (THESE ARE HUGE ISSUES WITH THE GAME) --&gt;&gt;&gt; Poorly optimized (even players with high end computers lag alot) --&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Servers lag often (only thing they seem to do is reset the servers which does nothing)   - Devs are really slow at fixing the game's problems - Hackers (they now get banned fast though) - Bad community (unfriendly) - NHVR sniper needs to be nerfed, ridiculously overpowered  ##################################################################  In the end, after 2,990 hours, was it worth it?  No. Servers at the moment are garbage, game servers lag almost daily (ddos or other excuse they say), and fps is garbage in the game always since they do not optimize it, and servers are always running on migitation (means more lags, less ddos)  Would not recommend this game as the core idea is good but the game itself is a HUGE disappointment. I've had to spend a ton of money to enjoy the game to the fullest. And to a degree, I regret it.
2624	1	a	Always been one of my favorite f2p games.
4607	0	a	The community of this game is absolutely horrible. The gunplay is some of the worst I have seen. It is extremely pay to win and it should be redlighted from steam in my honest oppinion.
4186	0	a	I really can't say I would recommend this game. The biggest issue I take with the game is the fact that the majority of the equipment you can purchase in the game (guns, cars, etc.) are time-based/temporary if you purchase with in-game currency. If you want to keep the weapon for good, you have to purchase it with real money (which defeats the purpose of this game being  F2P ).  To make matters worse, I would run into griefers/hackers every day &amp; decided the game just wasn't worth it after a short amount of time playing it. I came back to it a few times trying to look past the obviously flaws, but just didn't keep my interest &amp; I decided I was done with it.  If you don't mind micro-transactions, griefers &amp; hackers, then this game may be acceptable to you, but I for one don't have a place for it in my gaming library anymore...
7303	0	a	Poor game alot of lag questes marks are not on the map marken propely so this game i would give it a 4/10 very bad i dont think you should play this :l
6113	0	a	Pay For Win. Weapon balance so â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ bad
7074	0	a	I downloaded the game and it would even let me play the game so I Uninstalled it and then redownloaded it and still wouldn't let me play it. DON'T DOWNLOAD IT!!!
4599	0	a	the game is bad optimized my computer nearly exploded NOW I HAVE 8GB RAM THIS IS WORST GAME ON STEAM EVER
8980	0	a	Let me start by saying the game was fun at 1st, but only 3 hours in i felt there was a lack of direction in the game. The missions of fun(for a little bit) but i never felt it was leading up to anything. +, there are so many controls you could just hit some random button and it would probably do something, which is so confusing i just gave up. 5/10
371	1	a	One of the most addictive open-world games I've played in a really long time. APB is great fun and packed full of unlockable in-game material such as vehicles, clothes, weapons, and many others. Plenty of features to keep you occupied for a very long time. Best part: It's free. Highly recommended.
5198	0	a	If you see a positive review on this game, you know they are scraping that from the OUTSIDE of the bottom of the barrel. This just a junk game.
6915	0	a	Really i like most games and this seemed fun. *from the moment your in ur pitted agest anything from rank 5 to rank 100. *most players are to overpowerd at lower stages of the game. *tbh it's again pay to win *if you take the job and some little 5 year old boy wants to do even thou he/she is in ur team they will team kill you *most just do nothing let 1 person do all and then bich when they lose all over no thanks id rather go through frachuring my arm again then try play this any longer
9485	1	a	Um this game is just plain weird
2732	1	a	Funny open world multiplayer game with criminals vs police. Can be hard to learn and master.  Plus: Funny gameplay Good character customization Good car customization GTA feeling  Minus: Pay to win? Can be hard to master Can be frustrating sometimes
9997	0	a	I really liked the game at first, but it kept going downhill, the last thing I will say is the G.O.R.E. update, it released new weapons, a rifle, pistol and sword. Each one of those weapons were able to be upgraded 2 times, so it'd be rifle, upgraded rifle, upgraded upgraded rifle, but of course, each upgrade was harder to do, and the most upgraded rifle, could easily one hit kill someone, the DPS on the pistols (which shot in three burst (now fixed)) was insanely high, and well, for the sword, all melee is over powered so you get the idea on that. Some people made a clan to nerf the guns, some people made a clan to get rid of the update and killed anyone (the clan was always in a zerg) using the weapons, whether they were in the same faction or not. And then there was a clan that said to keep the update as is, and of course, they were using the Level 3 weapons. So they finally nerfed the weapons after about a month or so. Some people are wondering things like 'Why is he even saying this?' Well, I'm saying this because if the Devs released an update that had insanely OP weapons without even thinking about if it's OP, or to test it or anything really, It really makes me not being able to trust them with future content, and also, the only reason the nerfed it, is because people were canceling their subscriptions until they nerfed it 
3362	1	a	The design is far from mature and beautiful. Play it unless you love to shooting with massive other players or you enjoy drive cars in a sandbox.
8353	0	a	Doesn't even launch. Can confirm that the uninstall button works. 9.3/14.8.
6074	0	a	bad, a lot of bags
7053	0	a	i lunched iy 5 times and it did not lucnh and then i cant delete it so i dont like the game 
10911	1	a	Even though its difficulty is off-the-chain, its gameplay is soo addicting that it makes you go back and want more, and its really fast-pasted along with the character chooser which takes seconds to get into combat, on the other hand, you dont want to go in to some heated battles lv 5-10 or under, and ive been having some lagging issues like button delays. If it didnt have that problem it would be an excellent game, and not to mention its FREEEEEEEE!
10278	0	a	will not let me log in keeps saying invalid account or password can anyone help
8026	0	a	What a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ dont play this game, the character creator is the only good thing about this game.
6009	0	a	It makes me have to redownload steam and all my games, Also it gave my pc a virus.
2542	1	a	im kind of in the middle on this one it isnt the best and it takes alot of downloading and a good computer the driving mechanics are bad and i mean BAD but if youre in to like gmod role playing you might like this it has alot of features and great potential this is the diference with pc and console pc can change big time and i hope it does but on console you cant do that much its free so i guess i would play it every now and then i really hope the developers start fixing all of the bugs and definatly fix the driving
4825	0	a	For the love of god don't play this game and definetly don't buy anything in this game. This game is so p2w that i can't describe it,it's a cancer that's milking money from the victims. So i beg you to not play it as it doesn't deserve to be played. You'll just end up rage quiting one way or another.
8068	0	a	May have been worth downloading when it first came out, but now the only people playing it are kids who stole their parents money to buy a 50$ car and a 200$ full-auto pistol.    But if you have the money to do the same, it can be really fun, driving, missions, Shooting, are all great but if you dont pay over 100$ for a really good gun then you're not going to be able to get the in-game money to buy anything fun.
8662	0	a	Not that good tbh
3469	1	a	Don't feel like getting Saints Row the Third or GTAV? You will feel right at home with this type of chaotic madness gameplay. The game is alot of fun running around doing missions that take teamwork. But this free to play does suffer game crashes for now until it gets fixed in the future. 8/10
5300	0	a	5 years later and this game is still garbage.
7040	0	a	The game was free to play then it was pay to win now its who pays more he wins so dont play this game if you dont have money :D
6600	0	a	When the game finished downloading I couldnt wait to play it. But i was so dissapoited by the graphics and gameplay and servers ! Its fun for 1 hour or stuff ... and u cant compare this with gta !!!
10474	0	a	This game seems to be good. It has some nice features that combine more traditional MMORPGs with things usually found only in singleplayer games. However, there is one major problem: LAG! Shooting is, while seemingly well-designed, virtually impossible outside of spray-and-pray. Melee faces similar issues, but is at least feasible. In other words - good game, but it requires too powerful of a computer for the level of graphics and ai complexity it offers. If you have a powerful computer, I recommend it. If not, then don't waste time trying to deal with the lag.
8355	0	a	Great game, lots of hours on it, yes I did pay a bit which was totally worth it-not to win with paids guns, in fact it was other stuff which doesnt matter, but 2 years ago I randomly got banned. I know more than half of the people who say 'got banned for no reason' are just mad for getting legit banned, but one common sense I would add to my ban argument is the fact that I paid enough money to be smart and not cheat knowing I would get banned sooner or later. Used to by 10/10, 0/10 now..
7872	0	a	Not so good game in my opinion. Although it has a very deep character creation system and you can make chicks by your own taste. Graphics are cool, but very laggy. Servers are good. But there are way too many criminals. It's like enforcer is dying. I have stopped playing due to it's pay to win nature. Get this if you are rich low-life gamer.  PS: There is a nude character exploit.
7172	0	a	F4ck This Game.
5166	0	a	Pay to win and laggy servers, BOW BOW BOW BOW BOW BOW FLOCKAVELLI.
2433	1	a	awesome game but as too many lag
4040	0	a	you can only join missions and do missions it is fun for 20 minutes and thats it
10088	1	a	If you keep in mind that it's f2p you'l be stunned by the enviroment and all the little things that make this game worth it!
9801	0	a	I played it. Got renamed to a ridiculous name because my name offended the you know who. Then the same mod who had renamed me popped up in main chat to ask people to keep the discussion to game related Q&amp;A. I wasnt even chatting at the time, and the people who were were simply chit chatting. Apparently this is too much for this concentration camp of a game. No fun allowed. Only talk about the game.  I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hate this â¥â¥â¥â¥. Burn down every game company that manages its users like stupid cattle. God forbid giving personal details or talking about fun stuff. It might create you know, DISCUSSION. We dont want that. We want stupid morons who only talk about the game and pay their dues. Die. Eat it and die.
4137	0	a	The balancing in this game is non-existent. If you buy an armas weapon (Armas martketplace is the microtransations thing from gamersfirst (Gamersfirst is completeâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t, more like moneysfirst)) then you will reak havoc. Whisper, joker cr5, and any other armas weapon against you will make you want to kill yourself. Good luck.
9719	0	a	Laggy pice of â¥â¥â¥â¥, had this game before worked great, now no updates....laggy as hell cant even aim or move without laaaaaaaaagggg
6050	0	a	kant play its missing something
6703	0	a	If you like waiting extreme periods of time just to play a low graphics game, this is the game for you! When you first log in, you get to what I call the 'black box of death'. (And that after all the 10 other loading screens). Then you'll sit through 24 more loading screens and eventally wait 12 hours to get in a server, only to find that everyone is a total â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ that only kills you.
2507	1	a	Great Customizations!
8659	0	a	At first I thought I found the basic version of GTA V but I was dissapointed. Even though it says 5.5hours on my profile, 4 of those hours were spent trying to log in. My computer back then wasn't a pathetic piece of equipment but was actually rocking a core i7 @ 2.2Ghz, 6GB RAM and a GT520M. So it all landed back to APB having a bad community and little to no support. After successfully logging in, I found the game to lack anything that would keep me hooked and want to come back and play it again.
3036	1	a	I have just one question. How hard is it to make controller support? very shameful
5502	0	a	This game is a play for free, pay to win. There for it is terrible this game wants to be gta online but has terrible realism and pyshics. Also in this game as it is openworld pvp if you shoot someone they will not die, even if the gun is 50 calibre it will take more than 15 bullets. DO NOT GET THIS GAME!
9455	0	a	Couldn't get past the 'create account' and log in with steam crap. Waste of 6GB hard drive space.
10799	1	a	I like a challenge, i find that in this game
7620	0	a	so bad  hard controls  not fun
6810	0	a	pay2win and crappy servers. Do not even consider to download!
8613	0	a	P2W with unfair matchmaking, constant crashing and aim cheaters.
1208	1	a	I have a love-hate relationship with APB Reloaded. The pros are that it's a ton of fun to play. The cons are that it's really hard to get the hang of, and it's very buggy and crashy. Your screen loading times are also going to suck. But if you can get past all that, it's not bad for a Free To Play online GTA.
8454	0	a	this game went â¥â¥â¥â¥, seriously.. the community sucks so hard, it could easily suck you through a garden hose. besides that, the publishers tend to scam us by any means necessary. i'm not even gonna talk about the massively increasing amount of cheaters wandering about, ruining your day.
750	1	a	Ok heres the thing i'ts sort of like those games or toys thats a less a good version of something good. Sort off like a off brand, if you can't purchase Gta or Sleepingdogs or any open world games than play it. That's why its free I can't say its bad beacuse its free and it really doesnt matter. I like this game but its far off from anything close to a open world crime game. So heres what I rate it a 4/10 depends on which player you are. I would still just get it if you wan to have a little taste of a Open World Game.
2101	1	a	i honestly think this game is cool but after playing a couple mounths of it, it gets old and i start to rage it seams that there is a good comunity and a bad one in thisgame there are some hackers nto alot tho so i would recomend that you guys try it for your self.
9825	0	a	Guns are underpowered nuff said. When I shoot someone in the head I expect them to die.
6668	0	a	a nice game, really indepth char customization. sadly it gets boring really quick. as it is just -&gt;get money-&gt;launder-&gt;buy some of the limited items of ingame currency -&gt; do again  you also get spammed in the face every 10 minutes with BUY PREMIUM GET THIS AND THAT  Physics are also just complete â¥â¥â¥â¥. also is car steering  but with some friends on skype you can defenitely have some fun in here.
8254	0	a	Total control of charactor creation look is kinda cool. The game itself is a bit clunky and the shooter part is annoying. It lags some and there are plenty of people out there with exploits. I got addicted to this game until I finally realized it's full of 12yo's or people with the mind of a 12yo and all anyone wants to do is throw dumb insults around. The only thing about it that makes it worth downloading is that it's free to play.
8211	0	a	Used to be addicted and I used to never stop playing. It used to be fun, but the same can't be said.   Now, its a pay 2 win with a 'Rent System' and its a pain in the â¥â¥â¥ to get prestiged.  I wish I could go back in time to enjoy how this game used to be.
9261	0	a	Doesn't let me create a account.
4203	0	a	want to enjoy the game? buy the swagglicious overpriced cash item first.
3349	1	a	Massive customization options overall, even if you don't have the prem account, you stil can do a lot of fun making your own character if you have imagination, of course. Good shoot arenas, pace gameplay, tons of fun shooting others up. Not perfect, but it's free and really playable .. reccomend this for a choise over buying a GTA series, still not so good as those, but surelly worth a try..
1899	1	a	Alright, I'll say it right off, if you want something to just pick up and play and be great at it, this is not for you. It takes practice. Skill can overcome almost anything in this game (Except the serious problem with hackers) If you invest money in it, it can be fantastic, though I have not yet spent a dime on it. Going into this game remember to keep a cool head and communicate with your team, also remember it is a GAME meaning it is here to have fun. So have fun. I personally consider it a canvas. The customization in this game is addictive and delicious. It takes a serious grind to get everything, and I doubt I'll ever make it, but being able to customize to this degree, I think it's well worth while. Plus, who doesn't like killing cops while blasting Hollywood Undead out of your car speakers? Or blasting Five Finger Death Punch's 'Mama's said knock you out' while mopping the floors with some criminals? Either way, the customization is there, and if you like games but never feel like you play as yourself, or the character you want to be, or maybe you're just settling or picking a favorite, in any case, if you want to express yourself, this is for you. If you're reading this recently after I posted you can see my steam profile pic is indeed a modified screenshot from the game. Start it up, guys, be patient and try your best.
808	1	a	criminals are how you normally play the game enforcers are grade a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing scum they wait like cadavering(?) annoying pests and wait for you to get up a high amount of loot from farming the npcs by mugging them or doing ram raids then they waltz in like the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s they are, wait for the computer to give them a mission to stop you and â¥â¥â¥â¥ing shoot you in the face and steal all your hard work and money in about 5 seconds flat. 0/10 hate this game
6556	0	a	Wold be a fun game if it wasent full of aim bots and wall hackers. but it is so no real point in even playing unless you like that kind of bs i know some people will say just get the aim bot for your self so you can fite back but whats the point in even playing a game where the only way to be competitive is to cheat with them then its no longer whoever is better at the game but whoever has the better hacks that some one else made because lets be honest all the kids cheating are to stupid to know how to make an aim bot.
8750	0	a	I wouldn't force Hitler to play this game.
446	1	a	Great and unique game, lots of customization and cars / weaponry to suit everyones needs, fun mission objectives, almost no mission is the same in regards of what can happen, regular events and just alot to do overall. The downside is it hasn't recieved too many game changing updates in awhile other than the anti-cheat system but that's about to change with the engine update coming out awhile from now, which will make the developers have the ability of implimenting new content such as maps and game modes. It can also be somewhat difficult for new players considering the people with thousands of hours will basically demolish you in most scenarios, but given time you can learn.  (Also customization really only kicks in when you eirther get premium through events or purchase it with real money, which is rather unfortunate)  Summary: Solid game with great content and customization but limited unless you have premium and is also difficult to beginners.
1856	1	a	Cool 
6116	0	a	the game is completly one sideded all you have to do to win is 1.be a cop 2.buy guns and thing with real cash 3.camp criminal spawn points 4.wait for criminals to start a mission and seal club the new criminal players
10572	1	a	I haven't died this many times since Dark Souls.
2649	1	a	Good game lots of hacker
6697	0	a	Pay to win. rofl
1438	1	a	to spend time when u have nothing to do
2746	1	a	Dude grab ur friends and play so much fun man.
10823	1	a	A simple rougelike MMO, which even now I wonder how such an awesome idea didn't come to be sooner.  Unlike other MMO's your character does not respawn. This means that you must make a new character everytime you die. That may sound tedious, but there is no character customization outside of the class you choose so you can quickly start playing. This makes becoming a high level player a measure of a players ability to decide when to attack, when to retreat, and when to call your friends to gang up to get protected loot.  For those of you who play MMO's just for notoriety there are leaderboards for highest level in different time ranges.  EDIT: This game is very freemium now, but you can totally play the game just fine without paying for anything. Everything you buy is extra to what the game originally was.
3630	1	a	I'm generally very picky about games, but this I've enjoyed for 4+ years and still to this day enjoying it! Matter of fact, I bought a gaming computer just to run this game the way I wanted to! No regrets at all! Great and amazing game!
1125	1	a	Feels Good, Uninstalling. P2W
4623	0	a	They ban people for the â¥â¥â¥â¥ of it even if they've put hundreds of dollars into the game.
2502	1	a	Cops and Robbers, GTA style. What's not to love?   In-game midi sampler to create your own 'theme' In-game MP3 import system for car radio F2P Customisations only limited by number, not customisation.   Only thing is 250ms+ latency makes some missions unplayable, especially against those near the US Datacentres.
429	1	a	Ruined my life. 11/10 Would play again.
8504	0	a	ugggghhh if you dont wanna pay to win its really not worth playing this laggy game

4762	0	a	  This game is a sespool of juvenile players.
9679	0	a	There's a reason it's free to play...
3267	1	a	Really enjoyed this game, Does have abit of a pay to win feel to it sometimes but other then that I'd give it about a 9 out of 10, Now i just have to wait and see if the rumors about a PS4 and XboxOne release are true or not.
3637	1	a	Absolute garbage.  This game is the tale of pay to win tryhards vs. trolls who do not give a â¥â¥â¥â¥, and with hundreds of customization options under your belt, trolling could never be easier. Nothing quite as satisfying as running over an anime pay2win roleplayer with your â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ car plastered with the image of a â¥â¥â¥â¥ on the hood.  It's fun to an extent but don't expect depth unless you've got hundreds to spend.
10421	1	a	Great game. Fair for F2P Graphics - meh  
2814	1	a	This game is decent if you are willing to look past the bugs and rage inducing Pay 2 win weapons. I do suggest that you play with a group of friends and use VoIP, seeing as how its damn near impossible to win any missions without communication. This game is also pretty poorly optimized, loading the freckles of the pedestrians faces before loading the wall that you are about to unwittlingy drive into, so I urge you to only play this if you have a damn good machine and no anger problems.
8527	0	a	Fails to load Constantly
10178	1	a	Probably one of the best F2P games out there , well worth it
3674	1	a	good game good game i dont even like this game 10/10 I would install and uninstall this game!

6480	0	a	I took all the garbage trucks (3 other friends )and drive around the biggest streets just destroying every vehicule I would see. Destroying every minute a person would have...messing with his gaming time...you can't do that anymore as theres no more garbage trucks...
732	1	a	The game is fun and has many hours of gameplay. Interesting and detailed customisation. However can have moments with bad match making.
7258	0	a	Oh APB, the years I've spent playing. LAGGGGG. This game is the definition of bittersweet. Customization is the best thing this game has going for it. Create your own music, death themes(can be very annoying), cusomize your cars and customize your player(hair, height, weight, tatoos, ect...). This game has its own little producing software that isn't the best, but worth messing around with. The concept of this game is still great even though the exicution is terrible. There is too much wrong about this game but the worst thing about this game is the community. The missions are repetitive with no real storyline unless you want to read about the story when you level up contacts through the in game mail system. Any gun that give and advantage of course are all P2W exect a few that you have to grind for and buy from the marketplace where players can trade/sell guns, cars, songs, death themes, and logos(more that I can't remember atm). Their subscription is called premium and gives you basically 100% more in came currency and experience towards leveling up contacts(how you unlock non p2w items) The winning team of the mission only really matters who wins the final portion of the mission unless your team sucks much more that the opponents. Matchmaking is terrible although there are not enough players to really balance it. Spawn points can be very frustrating and much bs for the other team most of the time. After years of playing this game, I can say I've wasted hours just to unlock the overpowered nano automatic pistol. Once I obtained this goal, I uninstalled after really giving the game a chance. I cant reccomend this game for anyone to play because it is such a let down and pro players will give you your @$$ on a platter. The devs have promised a game engine update and have not done so. It is well over a year overdue. RIP APB it was fun while it lasted...
9584	1	a	PLAY IT! NOW! ITS AMAZING! DONT LISTEN TO THE BAD COMMENTS! GET IT!

1174	1	a	Was great and gives you Tourette syndrome for the time being but after a while it gets old but it's your call I'm done with it I think...
3091	1	a	Read stuff, adn you are perfect at the game, a couple of mintutes of me running around mugging people a girl askd me if I needed help and she showed me how to play the game! robbed people, killed cops and earned about over 10000 dollars in mintutes! so just play the game and ask for help!
3082	1	a	For some reson i love this game. the first time i played i didnt like the game that mach but i really recomend it to people that love being cool and are really good with art (on computers of cors) and for people that don't like killing but making money of the marcketplays thats it
7946	0	a	the game doesnt even work
4334	0	a	I really can't say I would recommend this game. The biggest issue I take with the game is the fact that the majority of the equipment you can purchase in the game (guns, cars, etc.) are time-based/temporary if you purchase with in-game currency. If you want to keep the weapon for good, you have to purchase it with real money (which defeats the purpose of this game being  F2P ).  To make matters worse, I would run into griefers/hackers every day &amp; decided the game just wasn't worth it after a short amount of time playing it. I came back to it a few times trying to look past the obviously flaws, but just didn't keep my interest &amp; I decided I was done with it.  If you don't mind micro-transactions, griefers &amp; hackers, then this game may be acceptable to you, but I for one don't have a place for it in my gaming library anymore...
5671	0	a	very bad.I'm wait for 2 day and game is not open!
6206	0	a	I've +500 hours (without steam) and i can easily say that devs don't care anymore. They don't try to keep cheats away. They just ban the ones using 'DETECTED' cheats. That isn't instant so they just open new accounts and keep cheating. Also you can pay for cheat. It is called 'ARMAS MARKETPLACE'. You can buy some weapons that is equal to cheat. You won't get banned for that though. By the way, when there is a patch i would get excited. I thought they will bring something new and good for the game. Every â¥â¥â¥â¥ing time i check the updates, I see more overpowered weapons and more bugs. Game is done for me.
7949	0	a	no good if ur new. the gear is too bad so you cant compete with the ppl you have to fight. the game matches you up against experienced players with mad gear -- no XP to be had. uninstalled
4679	0	a	Its just a very bad P2W-Game: 64% positive reviews. How is that even possible?
3698	1	a	great game :D
7978	0	a	It's fun, but it never got the finish it needed to be a truly great game. At this point, I would say wait for GTA V for PC. It's got similar gameplay, but GTA V is just much better in every conceivable way.
2190	1	a	five out of fiddy this games a niddy diddy ( Í¡Â°â­ÍÊâ®Í¡Â° )
5805	0	a	This game WAS worth consider playing, with gta-like elements and Wide range of customizations from clothing to vehicles and death themes and more .....but the pvp matchmaking is terrible AND with the type of weapons the devs allowed has made the type of 'fair game' disappeared. If you want to play this game with a much enjoyable mood then buying certain things from the game is recommended...I play it only if i have no games left to play.
1048	1	a	Pretty fun game to pass the time with, but need to play with friends, not a solo game :D
2944	1	a	This game makes me happy when i kill the crims and â¥â¥â¥â¥ u should play it now   pick a enforcer or crim enforcers make more money on missions crims can make money buy ram raiding and doing missions
7721	0	a	I'm sure that the game is fun for certain people but, while i was playing it, I had an incredibly hard time gaining a feel for the game. I could not figure out what was going on throughout the entirety of my playtime. I've been told the beauty of this game lies in the customization, a feature i did not play long enough to achieve, but I don't feel like that would be able to make up for the shoddy gameplay that I experienced
5629	0	a	As of July 2015 APB Reloaded is dead or very close. Matchmaking is near impossible as there is nobody to play with, at least on the gold servers which is annoying, most everyone only hangs out in the neutral district now :(
5914	0	a	i bought 20$ worth of premium and then the next day this update happens now when i click start nothing happens!!! i want my game to work or i want my money back!
4756	0	a	Very laggy not worth trying it... Also maid my laptop frezz and gave it bugs
7977	0	a	R-U-B-B-I-S-H!!!! i wont make a long review for a bad game, so heres why..: 1st: UNBALANCED GAME, i always found myself getting crushed by high-rank players 2nd: Unfriendly Community 3rd:This is the worst part.......HACKERS!!! Aimbots everywhere!!  So just dont install this game.....just DONT  
9146	1	a	It's a good game.
4786	0	a	I'd rather rip my â¥â¥â¥â¥ off and feed that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ to a dog than play this game.
7906	0	a	This game is a disease  ...the uninstall button is the vaccine  1/10 would uninstall again
7798	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS GAME THAT DOESNT EVEN WORK!!!!
10675	1	a	Nice game
864	1	a	The game is pretty fun to play with your friends but boring to play alone. It doesn't matter if your F2P or P2P you still have chance and the game is pretty balanced. Overall a very great game.
1751	1	a	Like Saints Row, only with thousands of bugs, 500ms lag and a 100% Brazilian fanbase!
1606	1	a	best part was when i unistalled it
1593	1	a	this game is amazing cant get over the fact that it is free GET IT NOW BEFORE IT IS NOT FREE its like gta 5 and cops and robbers ignore the haters they just make the game look bad, so before you do anything else get this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6062	0	a	I played this game for about a month (Don't mind the little play time on my steam account) and i can say this. Hackers everywhere, their servers are laggy as hell and with every update it gets worse. Next is the p2w thingy... If you are new to this game and don't want to spend any money on in than don't even bother playing it....  Edit 2015-06-12: Lags, Lags everywhere...
610	1	a	Okay, I like this game so I'm gonna list the pros and cons:  Pros. Good graphics Smooth car handling Easy to start You can be in groups  Cons. Servers shut down frequently BlingLords with over 9000 rank try to blow/gun you down any chance they get (these people can only do this if they're in a different faction) A tiny bit confusing
2567	1	a	10/10-APB Reloaded it is a very fun and unique game you pick a side the cops or the criminals both with different gameplay the criminals can rob store windows and load the stolen items into a truck and the police can chase them or the criminals can go and sell them for dirty money. I do reccomend you play this as it is is free but the only down side is that there are many hackers and it is kind of p2w at some points with super fast tommy guns or super fast cars that are bought with a ton of real cash.
8624	0	a	So I decided to change my old review since its been some years and the game had updates. But sadly the only updates were box updates. Not really anything fun to do except have some awesome looking customizations to anything. You can get sniped by a pistol from miles away, unload a whole clip on someone do no damge. So many funny things that will make you question what is life. Just play the game and expect having cool customizations. Don't expect anything else.
1008	1	a	This game is incredibly frustrating. But play it, because at the same time, It's one of the best F2P Shooters I've found.
6112	0	a	This is one of the worst games ive ever played. Everyone is a higher level then you and you cant do anything because its never a fair fight
10232	0	a	game wouldn't let me change my username and when i went to go log in the game kicked me from the launcher.
4358	0	a	I would like to say this is enjoyable as a Cops and Robbers game. I really would. However, this game boasts: an unnaturally spiteful, venomous community; misleading, restrictive pay-to-win microtransactions that holds too much sway over making-or-breaking the game; non-user-friendly technical support that somehow encourages more trolling and hacking than is present any other game; and boring, repetitive missions that have less flavour than any other MMO or shooter.
5349	0	a	Fairfight is broken, hackers out the â¥â¥â¥, and complete pay to win scheme. ARMAS Marketplace is worse than EA, Ubisoft, any of them. That's why no one knows about them, because they're so damn terrible.
3752	0	a	The game itself is in my opnion close to perfection IF! it had the been released right the first time. With no bugs more content.  Pros: The gameplay is amazing. driving cars is fun and different. some cars are hard at first and so satisfying to drive when you get the hang of it. The shooting in the game is also really amazing (tho it was far better before they started infesting it with new weapons) every gun is different. like playing a new game every time you change weapons. social district without a doubt the most unique part of this game.  Cons: The company behind it is absolutely â¥â¥â¥â¥. They are only focused on milking their players for money and as much as they can. They barely update the game anymore. hasent been a good update for years. The players in the game are toxic and mostly â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. its near inpossible to find a decent human being on it. Hackers, this game as been dealing with cheaters since it came out. Tho less hackers than you would think.   i would not recommend this game at all what so ever right now. the game went from almost finished to alpha stage. has only gone downhill since g1 took over this game.  I have spent 2500+ hours on this game. and this is all my opnion.
3439	1	a	it is a fun third person but one problem it crash A LOT i can barly play it but it is the first week on steam so....
9392	0	a	Very very â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ up
3336	1	a	JUST THUG LIFE!
5188	0	a	APB Reloaded. It's like the original APB, but driven straight into the ground so no one can enjoy it now.
1025	1	a	Only good part is importing music  I played for like 5 hours and 2 hours in im bored to tears so i just â¥â¥â¥â¥ed around ramming cars then i decided to blocked the garage and spam porn music 10/10 IGN 
6876	0	a	No real updates for years, mostly based on pay to win. Gets very repetitve, but a decent play at times. Community is mostly bad due to the fact that no one will show you any kind of mercy, but there area few friendly players who try help. I strongly recommend not spending any money on this game if playing at all.
10854	1	a	i love this game
7671	0	a	This game had amazing character customization. purely amazing, the details for styling, and creating your own personal look, is something other games need, BUT, and it is a big but, like on madea. THE GAME SUCKS. the first 30 minutes are pretty entertaining, but after that, it is just a completley horrid experience. shame too. as i said, the customization was nearly perfect. i give it 1/10....no joke 
1248	1	a	I am Danold Rump and I want you guys to not vote for my Step-brother, thank you. 
2253	1	a	I love this game but it does run slow but I do recommend this game.
2070	1	a	So, here you are. You're debating whether or not to press that sweet, sweet play now button. What could be the harm? I mean, you've heard it has a great customization system. It looks a little like GTA, and since you're too poor (or cheap) to pay for the actual game, you've come to the free version of it.  Well, as all free things come with, this game will have its downsides.  'Good' Things: - Awesome customization - Physics=non-existent - Be half naked and you still have the same amount of health as a kickass SWAT team member - Did I mention walking through the social district is essentially the same as watching porn? - Car customization too.  Bad things. Really, really bad things: - Pay to win. People will deny that it's true, but it is. Some guns can take you down in a simple two hits. Some guns can take out a car in one hit. - The presets for their character creation are TERRIBLE. It looks like you just rose from the grave to kill someone if you choose the female model (like me). - So I heard you liked cars? Well, be prepared to grind endlessly through missions to get the money and 'Joker tickets' to buy them. -Matchmaking is terrible. You may be a bronze rank (ranking being from bronze, to silver, to gold with gold being the highest) and be paired up with a full squad of golds.  - You CAN'T LEAVE A MATCH WITHOUT QUITTING THE ENTIRE GAME. - If you randomly get rocketed to gold rank like I did, when you can't kill people for â¥â¥â¥â¥ and are just playing to customize, guess what? No more going onto lower ranking servers, because obviously everyone who gets gold rank is MLG af. - 10 year olds.  10/9 would play for the rest of my days for clothing.
8936	1	a	Population is thin. Other wise a great game. It'll take yer time and replace it with fond recalls of how the wasteland was so grinding to collect crap off the land and npcs' bodys.
10566	0	a	Review from a White star if it matters to anyone :P  -Quit for a couple months now-  So okay I have 1000+ hours on it on steam alone and afterwards, went to adobe flash projector for a couple hundred hours, so hopefully this review will help many of you decide whether or not you will like this game. This game is permadeath, when you die you lose all your items, equipped/anything in inventory aswell.  Game is very hard to pick up, consider looking up guides on YouTube or steam workshop for reference.  Pros: Gameplay is extremely addictive!  Dying isnt so bad and you 'usually' learn from your mistakes! (atleast I do) If losing all your 'Precious' items will be too much for your heart to bear, this is not the game for you. (Permadeath) All of the classes are worth playing, maybe except for a few.  As for the community, its up and down. Mostly filled with children. Rare to see anyone over the age 18, so you can imagine what the chat is like. Not saying the community is bad, people will sometimes help you out, and you can make friends via guild system. But most guilds will only invite you if you are actually good at the game, which is cruel, but w.e. Getting loot is so satisfying, especially those yummy white bags.  Cons: Event notifier Amount of bots (inevitable in a f2p game, but bearable with the new feature that can auto- hide the chat from low ranked players)  I always have a my chat filtered so I only see ranked 10stars or above basically since I hate seeing my chat flooded from either children talking/spamming, or trolls.  I don't know if this is still out there but there was this thing that was out that would notify you via realm if there is a special quest of your interest that spawned in. This-was-the-breaking point for me... The times where I would be chilling in my home realm and see (Sphinx/Hermit) I'd be so hyped, nowadays when the event spews out 'A sphinx entered the realm' atleast 60 people from from other servers drop in to get the chance to get some awesome loot.  So onto the hate for the company Kabam...They started up pets which helped alot of new players, but made veteren players very upset. It was a new system that tries to get you to spend your real money on 'feed' to feed your pets to make them heal you more or make other abilities better. If you have the bank account, you can make this game so easy, that the only way you die is by being extremely dumb, or getting armor broken, or doing very very hard dungeons.  Now I do understand the company has to make money to keep the game running so im not upset about what Kabam is doing. There are packs they release that are understandable and pretty tempting to purchase but of course you dont have to. Now If you understand how the game works this game can be played without using your precious money but the most tempting deals would be chests/character slots. Everything else can be avoided, unless you are really bad and need to get the best items to be able to play the game. (I exploit this and load up on pots to buy top items from kids who use parents credit cards to buy items)  IN MY HONEST OPINION, Kabam is not a bad company...they need to make money somehow right? If they weren't releasing these items/keys/deals how would this game still be alive?  Overall this game is for me was great when it didn't have the event notifiers, but since they are out, the game has been getting worse and worse.   There are probably many more cons than the ones I listed but those are the two main ones that upset me. Rate: 5/10  Anyone with questions can ask here, im open to all feedback good/bad.
1693	1	a	It is here, where you will step into the dumptruck...and into history.
3844	0	a	I've played this game over 8000 hours( mostly non steam as you can see ). I've wasted 1000 of euros of ingame transactions..  Alot of hackers â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Engine â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ GM's  I do not recommend this game,  Pros:  U can pretty much customize everything.
9625	1	a	Great game! looks a lot like Fallout3 which I enjoyed playing. Though there are a few glitches as i started. great idea
10529	1	a	My progression as a player who has not spend a dime on this game: -&gt; Starting a new character -&gt; Levelling up to max level -&gt; Going godland farming -&gt; Struggling with inventory management because I have only 1 chest and 1 character to use -&gt; Manage to rebuild stats and items from recent death -&gt; Becoming overconfident -&gt; Dying to lag or a self-made mistake, which was made because overconfidence -&gt; Repeat  TL;DR: Remind yourself that  overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer   Jokes and complaining aside: I have had a great time while playing this game, give it at least a try, it's free to play anyways
1935	1	a	Im like this game
1868	1	a	This is the greatest pvp mmo ever.  Best customization of all time, you can be anything or anyone. Community is quite horrible but also hilarious, think barrens chat in vanilla wow. Great for casual players who want to shoot up other players and blow up cars. You need a lot of practice to get good at all the different weapons and you need to put in a â¥â¥â¥â¥ tonne of hours to level up and unlock weapons like osmaw (rocket launcher). When you finally get a grasp of what to do it offers the best pvp experience ever, but be warned players who are grouped up in clans are very difficult to beat which offers a lot of challenge. Ive been playing for over 1 year now and it still offers challenges and difficulties because your always playing against other players who are very experienced. For new players they have a tutorial which is very easy to understand but also lets you join in the game immediately and play with others.
2346	1	a	That game.... Developer claims its 'Free to play' , but its a pay to win... but its fun when you play agains 'normal' players ^_^
9378	0	a	Wasted 30 minutes of my life playing this game. Bad sound effects bad controls bad graphics bad gameplay.
6545	0	a	For me the game wasn't smooth enough it needs to be worked on a little more
530	1	a	I would have to say, the customization in this game is WAY better than GTA 5. By a long shot  I think this game deserves a thumb up because:  - It adds a compeitive feeling.  - The customization is unlimited. You can pretty much customize everything.  - The graphics are great and beat some games that are newer than APB  Cons -   - Since the game has been out for so long, people have more OP weapons. Or they buy them from ARMAS Market  - We've been playing the same missions for five years. Please add more,  - Some character issues like your eyes not moving, No jiggle bones on b()()bs.  - Some other small bugs.
2053	1	a	good time waster
1871	1	a	Laggy, wow they need to fix that. The only thing I like about this game is the customization is fun!
9674	0	a	It Looks Worse Than Fallout!
8466	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game...they say : ' Apb Reloaded need at least 2gb of ram and 4 gb recomanded ' i gave 2 gb ram..and i can run it ... ok ... :/
2413	1	a	pay to win like â¥â¥â¥â¥, fun as hell for about a week then it gets repetitive.
6110	0	a	its crap
7036	0	a	can't get past launcher. not worth the time.
1771	1	a	Oh yes I recommend this. This is a really good game other than some P2W stuff.
7133	0	a	i didnt like it, messed up my fkin graphics drivers
6036	0	a	Piece of p2w crap
8175	0	a	dont know if this game is good as the launcher wont work
7388	0	a	PLEASE DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS GAME !!!! This game was really bad, i think this game same like GTA. But, this game just like trash with big size on my PC. And also, the customize characters doesnt like Saints Row. And I really hated about lag connection.
5355	0	a	Nope.THis game looks good but its not its only and only pay to win!
4814	0	a	Cancer  Noun  'This Game'
9141	0	a	I want to play this game but it said i need to make an acount and i downloaded all the stuff ,ran it, and it wouldn't work i ran game like fifteen times and it said creat a acount again and agian and the some thing over and over.
10175	1	a	YES! this is the game i was looking for, it is old but extremly fun and awesome but there are some bad things like its mostly pay to play so dont expect much if you are just wanting to play without throwing in a few bucks but other than that its a nice game
3130	1	a	2/10  - Interesting gameplay - Imba cash shop - Cash sink
4988	0	a	Unless you like microtransactions, don't even download it.
598	1	a	Haven't played too much on this account but this game might not be the best anymore, but it is like a Cops'N'Robbers take on Saints Row, and both are loved by many and in conclusion, the game now isn't bad, still a little fun hourwaster. Kinda reminds me of CrimeCraft before they took it and â¥â¥â¥â¥ed it up with GangWars. Not a bad game. If you want a GTA-ish game, try it out!
1424	1	a	awsome game :p
7417	0	a	Now I dont have 1000 hours plus in this game like some people here but Ive seen enough to make a fair verdict. As a noob its hard to pick up like most games. But in order to combat the higher ranking played s you either must get MLG or pay 40 bucks for a weapon. (real moeny) You could buy the weapon for a few days but then after that your screwed. I am no means good at the game but I'd like to think Im more of a novice as I was ranked silver 2 I believe? (This is actualy decent in this game not like CSGO) The whole conecpt is pretty cool and the customization amazing. But the whole combat and progression system is really hard to get used to. If anyone has anything to say about my verdict (like my opion matters) please tell me, am I just bad? am I using the wrong guns? Or am I just doing everything wrong? But for now, this game needs some serious balancing issues.
5060	0	a	doesnt load for abou ten mins the doesnt work
5431	0	a	The thing i hate in this game is that I'm getting killed all the time by Pay to Win players. It makes game unplayable.
3942	0	a	This game.........you want to love playing it..........you really do, and dat first, it seems like you can actually be good at this game, but then you run into the gold players..........the ones who have all the best equipment, bought straight from the dev's, paying real money to have a significant advantage over everyone else, and it doesnt matter that you are at the bottom of the chain here, a bronze level player, they can just come right down and play against you, making it impossible for you to win a single mission. Then there are the hackers, they are out there, for sure. Aimbot is a definite obstacle, so for now, I say dont waste your time playing this, the game was a great concept, I still wanna play it, but until something is done about balance, about pay to win players, and about hackers, I cant even look at APB anymore....... R.I.P APB, i can only imagine what you could have been...........
9505	0	a	It have got a lot of bags. And error in connecting 3/10 Screenshoots are good :3
1728	1	a	If you can't afford GTA then you should really try APB Reloaded, an open world full of Criminals and Enforcers, steal cars or drive your own, go on missions and gain some money. It takes a little getting used to but it's fun once you get the hang of it. The customization is great, probably the best out of F2P games except, the hair styles. The graphics are good but you will need good specs to run it smoothly.
9862	0	a	This game is bad, like really bad, itÂ´s so boring, looks ancient, and itÂ´s very uninteresting.
3585	1	a	Only punched me in the nuts twice, pretty okay experience.
4496	0	a	Gosh, this game is completely f*cked up! Matchmaking is utterly bulls*it. From the very beginning you need to play with highlevel characters and donaters. Donate, f*ck, it's terrible. It's not just 'pay to buy something faster than the others' it's completely 10000% Pay2Kicka*s. Customization in this game is just wonderful. It is the one reason why you should play this game, else DON'T EVEN TRY IT.  AVOID THIS GAME AT ALL COSTS.
1648	1	a	Not the most riveting game of all time. It's VERY much a grind, the community is HORRIBLE, mostly just trolls and not only do the mods and GMs not care about trolling, they take an active part in it. They SAY cashshoping is 'balanced' and doesn't give cashshoppers an unfair advantage, but that SO isn't true.  The good, though? Pretty much unparalleled customization. Customizable clothes. Customizable cars. Even customizable MIDI-ish themes you opponent hears when you kill them.  This game seems to love to tap into that primal part of your brain that makes you want to show off your decaled-up car to the masses.    It's a time-killer, but definitely not something I'd pay money into. But that's just me. Paying into it apparantly DOES help the game progress faster... no joke, it gives you extra 'standing' and money.
10849	0	a	why is it perma death
5823	0	a	The connection is awful
7555	0	a	Do not download this game, it is fun an all, but for a little, the matchmaking is terrible, you might be just starting to play, 1 minute into the game and you can get a mission vs highest rank with max weapons and such. Also, people get banned for no reason, me and my brother got banned for using 'hacks' if i'm correct in which if skype counts as hacks than thats just ridiculous. Do not recommend this, it is fun, but it gets you more â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off more than anything.
4919	0	a	This game is fun.   I am also a compulsive liar.
8425	0	a	THIS GAME used to be good i havent spent a single cent on it it used to be good....... But there is also one thing holding me back from this game is that there are no australian servers...... Turning and killing people is SO delayed over here i literaly have to press the turning button 3 seconds in advance for it to even turn and the deaths are so delayed its not funny. Gamersfirst if your reading this PLEASE make an australia server or an oceanic server alot of aussies will play this game if you had that.
7622	0	a	This worst game what made with unreal engine...so many server lags...full of cheaters and bugs.How it's still alive?  Or why not made another game like this?
7635	0	a	COOL BUT CAN GET OLD
10405	1	a	Come Play Fallen Earth I used to play WoW, then I grew up.. Melee is a good way to find me shooting you in the face! If you love to craft and build a character then Fallen EArth is for you. Lastly this is a ! sever game so no hiding, active GM at alll times. Exellent Community of gamers also. Come get some I freaking Dare ya! Edit : No active GMs, game is very much alive, still a vast world to explore. This game requires a high intelligence, reading, thinking and a high amount of patience. Free too play not Play to win and that is always a plus!
5171	0	a	while the game is semi enjoyable, it is comletely and utterly Rekt'd by Pay 2 Win Contents and makes playing the game pointless and not worth the effort,  if you got money laying around your house / burning a hole in your pocket, i guess you can try this game, but i personally would rather give the money to a charity then pay for any DLC for this Game, or ingame item as the only way to stand ANY chance against other players is BUYING DLC's / ingame items.
445	1	a	If you didn't get what you excepted from GTA Online. This game is freaking perfect for you. It's way much better than GTA Online. First of all, It's open world in a server for 90 players. There are 5 different maps(excluding special maps for special days). There are so many online things you can do in the offline mod of GTA series. You should definitely give it a shot.
5667	0	a	This is a good game but sadly poorly executed first off the cars handle HORRIBLEY youll be slipping and sliding everywhere also the guns you start out with are crap you will ALWAYS find your self out gunned against other players and the pay isnt good either my vederict is just buy gta 5 that game is good and much better than this
2693	1	a	this game is the best but i wonderd what if i riched the last lvl in the whole game  would it be fun?
9626	0	a	this game sucks
4802	0	a	Pay to win.
8883	1	a	First impressions:  As you can see (at the time of writing), I haven't played the game much, as such I can only write about first impressions.  Loading the game initially through steam, account setup is pretty basic (log in, verify e-mail, get to playing) except for one tiny detail... you can't choose your user name. The software generates a hash code for your name (around 20 characters in length including upper/lower case letters, numbers, and hyphens ( - ) ) and I have to say... the support team is *FAR* less than helpful (their response : we can't change unique user names)...  Okay, let me rant a moment... so what they're saying is their programmers can't use SQL? Can't use PHP? Can't... um... access their OWN databases? I think not... I think someone is too lazy to correct their mistake. Log in with an e-mail because 'that's the username'... but tried logging in with my e-mail and it says 'invalid username' but using the hash... all hunky dory.  There, that's out of the way, let's get to the game itself and not the customer service.  The game is old-school. The graphics sit somewhere between Fallout 2 and Fallout 3. The NPCs and 'Monsters' are all standing around in one place, tethered to a spot (where they will chase after you for a predetermined distance before giving up and returning to their spawn) ~ a lot like EverQuest 1. The world itself is a little on the empty side, but I cannot honestly say if it remains this way (the internal zones and buildings are pretty cool, and for a game that is set in a wasted world, it's as desolate as it should be).  The story-line is thoughtful and creative, even if it's a little flat and tired. It is interesting, it is engaging, it's just that it's a bit 'old.'  The GMs are super helpful, and I've seen them online every time I've logged in. The help channel is busy, and responsive (I can't even begin to say how refreshing that is)! That said... they have the typical censored chat system that is pretty much par for the course... but don't bother censoring your own words (like: aw s*** that sucks) because a GM will threaten to mute you for language (a redundancy which borders on zealous). Hardly anything to complain about... keep it clean (and PG so you don't offend the super-innocent teenagers playing this game - note sarcasm).  Movement is a bit cumbersome and unweildly ~ but once you're used to it it isn't too bad (such as hitting tab or the middle mouse button to turn on targeting, and therefore a locked mouselook instead of free-look). It's pretty hard to get the camera around front of your character (but it's entirely possible I've just overlooked something).  Skills, stats, levelling, trades... a detailed system. A wonderfully detailed system. APs (which I may mistakenly believe to mean 'action points') are granted frequently in small doses for everything from quest completion to simply levelling up your trade skills. Mousing over anything will give you a clear and detailed description of what that thing is for and what it does and what it effects - I've long desired that games did this, some do, but FE starts with this right out of the gate... they do NOT leave you in the dark (as long as you can read at a Junior High level, it's sweet).  Questing is a bit weird to get used to - the map (okay, the map... WOW... if you like detailed maps that don't hold your hand, but make some pretty obvious markers... then this map system is for you - detail, detail, detail... easily one of the most beautiful map systems I've seen in a game in a LONG time)... anyway, the map... shows a little red X on your radar that when you mouse-over it will show you the name of the quest it's for. There are no indications of distance on the radar or for quests, and some quests are a bit ambiguous (really, they just don't hold your hand there - read it... then figure it out ya lazy bums)!  Will I continue playing? You bet. What is the not free to play? Buying keys for dropped lockboxes. Unlocking your entire wardrobe. Paying for premium content (usually access to skills, timers, clothing, zones, etc) in three different monthly plans (from about $12 to $30), not so bad - but pretty steep considering you can get a great deal more out of a game like LotRO (Lord of the Rings Online) for about $15/month, with far better quality and content. Still, not too bad, save that it's comfortably on the expensive side (especially for what it is and offers).  Do I recommend it? Yes. Get past the opening stuff. Put some points into Intelligence and Perception (both of those increase your maximums for tradeskills), and READ THE QUESTS.  If you don't like reading, or actively engaging a game... this isn't for you. I, however, love reading the content in a game (I want to see what other writers and creative teams are doing with their work) and I enjoy a challenge. As such, I really enjoy this.  In short, a rocky start, some negative experience with the customer service and GMs, a bit unweildly and old-school, and expensive beyond the F2P... but a game that grows on you quickly and really eats up time (that's a mark of a good game right there).  Test it out. If you liked Fallout 2 and 3, then you'll probably enjoy this. I don't think it's a 'long term' game (as far as playability) in my books, but that's simply my own opinion and nothing more. Plenty of players are really enjoying this game, and that speaks volumes about the overall content and quality.
3230	1	a	Started the game up, then got chased by a group of yellow cars and a yellow van.  10/10
184	1	a	This Game is a Freaking Crash Course!!!! Go out with friends and destroy anyone who apposes ya! This game is very fun and pretty clean! HAVE FUN GAMERS!!!

6085	0	a	I'll sum it up with just one word and that word is â¥â¥â¥â¥, absolute â¥â¥â¥â¥.
5833	0	a	Horrible
5678	0	a	10/10 would bang, fun to not play... this games sh*t
7894	0	a	It was once a good game, now broken by bad devolopers, bad matchmaking, and greedy developers.
3020	1	a	SO MUCH FUN :D  This game may be a pay-to-win but just avoid the few players that pay to win and you will have a great time with mates. The more people you have working together the more entertaing it is ^_^
7315	0	a	Fairfight is a joke. Cash shop gets more updates than the actual game. Promises of fixes and better gameplay yet servers act trashy randomly. GTAV might be better but good memories here, it is worth playing for a bit but unless you quit life and play non stop you will always get trashed on. Don't expect much with this game seriously.. 7/10
7137	0	a	APB Reloaded is pretty much deviant art packaged into a .exe. I feel tremendous pain for those who have paid money on this incarnation of this game, which feels like a time capsule as there has still been no meaningful addition to what it offers players even after years of 'development'.  I made a Harlem Globetrotter though so I shall rate this game a 8/10.
481	1	a	If you want to play a game like Grand Theft Auto V that is free, Play this awesome game!
2097	1	a	Amazing game, defenately worth a try. However, preapare to grind a little for good items.
7943	0	a	--This game is not F2P, you either pay for premium or don't bother--  APB Reloaded is a game that can be lots of fun but only if you buy a premium account...  I used the premium account trial and I had a great time playing as a criminal but when my trial ran out it immediately had huge effects on my game, most of my stuff became unusable and my best vehicle that I put loads of in-game cash into was turned into a pay wall.  This game has awful matchmaking, I was put into multiple matches against people who were three times my level and all they had to do was shoot me in the foot and I would die instantly.  If I was willing to buy a premium account I would probably like this game but the faulty matchmaking and dodgy reports about the developers will keep me far away from this game.
2411	1	a	i havent played alot of this but it seems good but the matchmaking snt fair
3172	1	a	Very fun. Didn't like it in the first time but I am now loving it.
9974	1	a	Very well made, alot of freedom and... well it's just done right. It's basically Fallout 3 online but a bit different, not in a bad way though. Also it's now recently become free to play so there is no harm in trying it! What do you have to loose =D
8187	0	a	Not really into it, played for an hour got bored cause I have no idea what I'm doing
2864	1	a	This game is like a Free GTA, plus more
7420	0	a	I CANT PLAY THE GAME I HAVE A 64 BIT AND IT DOESN'T ALLOW 64 BIT TO PLAY THE GAME AND WHEN I LAUNCH THE GAME IT SAYS MY VIDEO CARD IS INVALID
7054	0	a	laggy servers, tons of hackers, shtt devs, 3rd person shooter tactics are aids
2480	1	a	Simply Awesome !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6824	0	a	This game is sh*t. I'll play it.
6267	0	a	too boring
2917	1	a	Smallest Maps in the History of MMO gaming lol, Still, a funky â¥â¥â¥ game, glad it got brought back. Had a good fan base :)  Game has WAY too much customization, which in turn made the game extremely small in comparison to other MMO's.  If the maps were bigger, And didnt take 30 seconds to get from one end of town to the other, I'd consider giving this another go, But Beta was as far as I went :|  Maybe one day :P When I'm bored â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
7141	0	a	this â¥â¥â¥â¥ took 8 hours too dowload and wouldn't even let me run it
3609	1	a	this is a mix of gta. cod. and nfs. its amazing. the bad stuff about it is that it has bad graphics and {sometimes} poor matchmaking. also HAX EVERYWHERE THE ONLY WAY TO FIGHT EM' IS RUNNING ehem...where was i? oh.   yeah.   the market place has some dank player made stuff.  BUT the apb official marketplace [the gc one] is just overpriced. all the REAL DANK stuff is p2w. i did it. [duh] well its not OP but it gives you a slight advantage.
9283	0	a	Deleted this game, after endless re installs, couldn't get the game to load past the character generation screen,
8801	0	a	idfk what is this game...... it seems prety stupid to me
6162	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ freemium game.  That's all there is to say.

7268	0	a	Ignore the Mostly Positive sign.  Even Uninstall doesn't work properly. 
9754	0	a	I see other beta testers here, sorrys all around.  I had bad expieriences with their GM team, basically playing pocket sausage with their alt- characters and clans. I have heard from others that they have the same problem.   Link is picture of what I am talking about  http://i.imgur.com/z3Wc69A.png    Basically, the game is run like a spoiled kids plaything, because GMs ingame have little oversight and do not really care about keeping up the playerbase. It is rotting in its prime. And a shame, because it had really great mechanics when it first was introduced years ago.
7908	0	a	If you trade legendary items you get banned for scamming. So either buy it with ingame money or don't trade weapons at all.
4071	0	a	3 years ago probably one of the best games out there. NOW probably the worse one you can play if you play it for the shooting aspect. THE BAD #1 Get good with carbin or lose #2 Premium or die of old age #3 VERY toxic community (salty,tears,getgud,â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥) typical vocabulary amongst #4 Porn #5 Animation canclation a thing #6 Seeing through certain walls (not fixed over years) #7 Unjust bans #8 cheat scripters not being banned? #9 very very lacking on updates #10 The more money you got (real cash) the more youl succeed -spent alot - notices difference   THE GOOD #1 Amazing customization #2 Good game to hang out with people #3 Car customization/Driving is awesome Thats it i give this game a big thumbs down - about 8K hours of game play over the past 5 6 years WORTH IT back then NOT WORTH it now .
4692	0	a	Loved this game at launch, but then the devs went bankrupt and the game shut down. Enter GamersFirst, who promised so much and delivered so little. I stopped playing in 2012. Hankering for an MMO and filled with fond memories, I reinstalled it yesterday and played just fine for an hour, then I get a Punkbuster kick for Disallowed Program/Driver. Not a clue what it could be related to because I can't find any log or anything even remotely helpful apart from an old stickied post in the APBR forums telling me to delete the pb folder in the game directory and reinstall pb etc... So, reluctantly, I do just that and now I get kicked every 3 minutes for packet flow. Solution to that? Uninstall pb and reinstall. Did I NOT just do this? So you know what? â¥â¥â¥â¥ it; I'm done.  Before I go though, let me tell you prospective players to just stay clear of this travesty; the core of the game is still fantastic, but the game as a whole is just muddled with â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥te added by G1. What is essentially a CTF has it's own lobby, but it almost completely removes vehicles from the equation and the top dogs are the guys with the most OP weapons of the week, because G1 wants their money. If you're a Bronze or maybe even a Silver, you can enjoy access (or not, if it's full) to a lobby that actually is representative of what APB is. If you've hit Gold threat, then good luck finding anything but the aforementioned CTF.  If you don't have a top-tier, paid weapon, then prepare to get â¥â¥â¥â¥ on by anyone who does. The game has been this way ever since G1 got their grubby â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥tained hands on APB, and I am sorry that I ever forgot about that. Also, Punkbuster has been a known issue for this game since 2012, help to sort this issue is not actually helpful, the 'known' fixes--if they work--only work for a few days at best before you have to repeat the whole 'fix', and... â¥â¥â¥â¥ it; I'm done.
7037	0	a	Terrible game pay2win
8902	1	a	Updated : 8/18/15  Currently the game has undergone large changes to the combat system (Skills and Mutations mainly) which gives far more choices for character builds. Previously there were skills, and mutations, that were not worth taking for any given reason. This isn't the case anymore.  Missions beyond Sector 1 are terrible unless unlocking vanity items or social boosting items, you're better off spending your time killing NPCs that give the best XP for the least effort (rats for example) because the Devs are most likely never going to fix this issue.  The 'story' within the missions is still good, but you will feel cheated after completing a 5 hour long quest that you could have earned 30x the experience along with 20x the profit/reward.  Weapon choices for PVP will feel very 'one sided' in 1v1. I recommend not going 'Rifle' if you plan to fight 1v1 in PVP. In Group fights is where it shines, I strongly recommend avoiding Assault or Battle Rifles at level 55.  Lack of updates since the previous major update (8/1/2014) beyond increasing 'Dome Tokens' have lead to a heavy decline in population. DO NOT EXPECT THIS GAME TO HAVE REGULAR UPDATES, the Devs are depressing when it comes to this. Not to mention never finishing projects completely... they simply move on to the next 'big' project.  Examples : Terminal Woods, Alpha, TC, and Dome, None of these are 'finished', just 'acceptable'.  If you plan to get to end-game, ignore ALL previous weapons/armor at 55. As there is no progression into the newer armors, it is best to save all your chips/DT for the AP weapons and GT Armor since they are the same price or lower than the previous armors.  DO NOT EXPECT TO NOT DIE TO SOMEONE WITHIN YOUR FACTION IN PVP : It is intended through lore and mechanically for your own faction to beable to kill you in PVP, this is indeed a wasteland and should be treated as such.  THERE IS NO GROUP CONTENT WORTH DOING IN THIS GAME : It is nice to bring a friend, but don't expect to find some amazing place for your 8-32+ group that's challenging... let alone rewarding :(  I only play now to help others learn the game, kill rerollers (those who remake after previous bans), and PVP if there is any.   While the game is old, it is limited by F2P standards I would recommend it for a game to play if you enjoy MMOs, crafting, and of course PVP. Only downside, don't expect to master 1 skill, it's better to be great all across the board on skills to give yourself the best advantage in PVP at least.
94	1	a	Somewhat fun, but HORRIBLY broken.  Broken matchmaking, Broken grouping, very cheap overused gun combinations, heavily promotes being a horrible player and camping.  Luckily this game is hanging by a string, it will be dead from lack of funds soon.
5569	0	a	All these 19 hrs that you see here were all updates for me....i didn't even get to play the game...our internet is not that bad to download all the files within around maybe 2 hrs at the most..like literally the update speed was 10 kb/s
9876	1	a	So far It's quite very nice. Had fun playing it

10540	0	a	You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself be bought by Kabam.
547	1	a	decent.  needs new engine, please g1 I want that bloom back!  community is small but it's alright apart from the cheaters.
8407	0	a	The Game is a concept thats pretty cool, but is executed poorly.  Pro's- -the game is Free. -Large map -Good Graphics Con's -Requires a beast of a pc to run properly -EVERYTHING is behind a pay wall -Unbalanced -IF you even buy some gun, you only keep it for 3 days -Map is lacking most detail -i found no use for in-game currency  Overall it's a 4.5/10 for me, I don't reccomend it, but you try this game, i's for 'free'
4070	0	a	Don't use any money on this game, EVER. GamersFirst will most likely take your account and ban it for some random reason they can come up with in 20 minutes, or you'll get yourself banned for receiving messages from someone on the other team screaming cuss words at you.  Gameplay is complete crap, and it's the most pay 2 win game I've ever seen. If you do not wish to spend countless hours every day grinding missions with absolutely useless weapons until you're almost max-ranked, so you can actually use some decent weapons with good modifications and a nice car, you'll have to pay insane amounts of money on weapons or cars. 
2085	1	a	Very Nice Game,Fast And Full Of Action,Really Cool ;)
7963	0	a	i dont understand how to progres in this thing
3398	1	a	Played with a buddy of mine for about an hour or so, it was very fun flanking camper VIPs and killing them one by one until the game asked us to go after people carrying drugs and we got seperated. Didn't see or notice any hackers, but almost everyone was playing together with their friends so not suggesting playing this alone. It's a free game, don't have high expectations but it's good enough to waste a few hours now and then with your friends.  Here's a gameplay video for you;          YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Being Bad at: APB Reloaded | This is our trash! | BurasÄ± bizim Ã§Ã¶plÃ¼ÄÃ¼mÃ¼z!&nbsp;

3111	1	a	EPIC GAME so much fun GET IT its free!
8809	0	a	First, I would like to say that this review is in no way influenced by the Steam Awards Nomination Committee 2016  or.. maybe it is.
2023	1	a	Definitely a fun game! Even on a crappy computer like mine I still find a lot of joy in this game.
6515	0	a	Nah Even if you have 8gb ram it still says not enough ram
3013	1	a	APB Reloaded is a fun game in general, it's your basic shoot em up but it has a distinct twist of cops and robbers feel to it even though its just like any other game. What is realy surprising is that so much planning and detail went into it but the lag and the people running it our terrible. They gave up on the game but it's still fun to play if you deal with all the problems, its a load of fun especialy with friends and since its free, its a must have!  What stands out:  Fun with friends: 9/10 Lag level: 5/10 (thats bad btw) Design and Polishing: 8/10 OVERALL: a 7/10 but still worth playing! 
774	1	a	Great game with a lot of potential. Great customisation of your character, cars, clothing etc. There are some hackers on the game but it is pretty rare. The game is very addicting and once you get into the game it is pretty hard to quit. There are only 2 maps and you pretty much do the same missions which can get a bit boring but pretty fun. The ARMAS marketplace is constantly releasing new micro transactions or in game items which is maybe good on the one hand but also pretty bad in the other. Although the main thing is APB's player base which is pretty low and maybe even considered as dying off. All in all i think the game is great with a lot of ptential although has some major cons.
9700	1	a	ive only played this for 2 hours but love it. 9/10
5617	0	a	I played a little bit I guess.  Pay 2 Win.
834	1	a	I like the game, but not sure about the anti-cheat system.
2965	1	a	This game includes a dynamic custom content editior in which you use too create all your own content; For example you can make a Hello Kitty symbol and place it anywhere on your Character, Vehicle, or Gun.   You have two factions, Enforcer or Criminal, these two factions battle it out in mini-games known as 'Missions'.This is a very team orierented game. I highly recomend getting a group together before jumping in.   Understand that this is an M Rated game and as such there is content inappropriate for children under the age of 18.   This so called 'PAY 2 WIN' doesn't really exist in this game despite what people will try to tell you. Most of the guns are balenced and can kill any purchased gun, given proper weapon skill, e.g. knowing where to move and how to fire.  There seems to be a minor hacking problem amoug users but, nothing too serious, The Company that runs this game(GamersFirst) does a good job at banning the big hackers. The Servers can be quite laggy at times and this is partly due to the old Unreal Tournament III Engine not being able to handle the game in the first place. They've added a lot of modications to the engine in order to do what it does today. As time progresses we should see an upgrade to the engine, so that is soon to come.  Overall this game gets a 8/10 for replayability and overall tactical battle sense.  Download and try it today!
10339	1	a	Meh i played worst but its ok
3848	0	a	It's pay to win. The community is worse then CS:GO's community. Lots of cheaters and hackers.  However the game itself is not that bad.
8397	0	a	Jim Sterling said it best... (Final score 3/10)
10317	1	a	This game isn't half bad; honestly I thought it was going to have the same or similar graphics as LOTRO but it surpassed my expecation of such. The keys and buttons are kinda hard to learn when you are so used to a certain system of keys, but once you get the hang of it the fights can go smoothly.
366	1	a	... 
10738	1	a	WHY GOD IS MAD? I DON'T CARE  GAME GOOD.

9062	0	a	it isnt really free. when i downloaded it it just made me make an account for some other game engine. it also dowloads other things that arent even associated to it. do not get this game!
7566	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥
3118	1	a	Great game, when the server isn't lagging or matchmaking is broken or you end up facing a hacker. But the customization is great visuals are cool and combat is fun if you can get used to it and the driving.
677	1	a	Take it from someone that has way more hours on this game then steam shows (as i played before the Steam release) This is a great game, yes it has its flaws and its dev team can be very untrustworthy for what they say. But all in all this game is awesome. The biggest cry you will see out there is 'P2W' and 'Hackers'. This game is far from P2W, one of the most powerful weapons in the game is the Starter gun known as the STAR-556 with its big brother the N-Tec, both f2p weapons that can beat ANY gun at ANY range with the proper amount of skill. In fact around 90% of the games Premium Weapons are Re-skinned versions of the f2p varient with a different look and sound (N-Tec=CR-5[AK-&gt;M16]) granted there are a few weapons that are unique in the premium (ARMAS) store but they are far from P2W, requireing a situational or unique playstle to use/master, the problem comes down to price with permanant premium guns costing $20-$60 each. The next cry comes from hackusations. Where as i found hackers are really far and few in between depending on your server (EU servers and Asian Servers have time and time again proven to have more hackers 10 fold) and when you do encounter a hacker they can be outplayed just like any other player. Wallhacks wont help you here, aimbots only aim they dont account for recoil or dispersion.  This game is great even at its current state, where most of its negitive reviews come from F2P warriors that cant even afford a summer sale game or a runescape membership and people that just cant cope with its learning curve (which is very steep). But once you learn the game and are able to stick with it, you will LOVE it. with endless customization and tons of laughs to be had ive found myself playing this game over Triple A games.  Give it a shot and dont give up too soon.  10/10 would spank walletless 12 year olds again.
8773	0	a	I made two new accounts that i have never played on before and my account got suspended because of a terms of service thing. I am over 18 and i accepted the terms of service on both accounts and i saw nothing wrong but as soon as i try to join a district im banned.
9431	1	a	To anyone who enjoys a gritty post-apocalyptic world with a detailed crafting system, yet doesn't mind a slightly clunky, aging interface - I would suggest they at least give it a few hours.
8057	0	a	pay2win w/ hackers luvly
7886	0	a	i hate this stupid game i got 6 accounts banned with 5.000$ wasted on them. dont try to play this game and gamersfirst is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ all they do is just steal money and bann yourr acc. I recommend you guys not to get it and btw i have never hack in my apb account in none of them and boom! This account has been blocked (10008) I LOST 6 ACCOUNT because of this â¥â¥â¥â¥tards they make allot of money because of their â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t
1404	1	a	Its great, i love shooting peoples face off :)
8566	0	a	well it could have been a great game but the missions are repetive and it just feels clumsy  also there is the pay to win part.. the grind is horrible on free player and customization even is limited if you dont pay  i dont really know what to say about this game... but it's horrible...
6440	0	a	Not what i expected its not like GTA it has some things that feel like GTA but most of it is not
3788	0	a	Played this game for a few hours. Stinks worse than hot garbage on a summers day..
5377	0	a	While it has been like two or three years since I last played, the only thing I can remember is that it had some severe pay to win going on. There were a lot of things you had to pay for actually, if not for that then it would be a really fun, cool game.
1677	1	a	i reccomend this game if you are going to play with a group of 2 or more, if i had to point out a negative about this game it is that it takes abit of time to launch so if yours doesnt open up instantly give it sometime,
1825	1	a	it more like a cop and robbers type game 
2684	1	a	cool game
2439	1	a	Always been one of my favorite f2p games.
8696	0	a	It was a great game until they change the game. The server so laggy when they put the server together {west and east}. Building load slow, bad community and banned for no reason even if its 'skills'. I believe the banning is causing the game to be low population 'silver is now gold' from what i heard. I hope they fix the game ASAP or its gonna go POOF.
2312	1	a	I've been playing APB reloaded for about 100+hours so far its not that bad i find it quiet fun, if you arent that skilled it could be a complain on match making, im alright with this since i usually get 2k score rating im inbetween gold/silver ranking. To me its not bad at all nothing wrong with it, yes some weapons are OP in Weapon shop which could be considered Pay to win, but i found after i get upgraded stock weapons that usually comes to Tactics and which weapon is equiped but mostly on tactic it self, i killed and won over many Pay to wins.   To me try it out see how it goes dont give up so fast, you must be pretty good at games like a proper 'gamer' good with progression, people who have just started gaming or havent played much of these type of games would find this game abit challenging. How you tell your doing any good is if your getting better scores they do and over 1k score rating and going up most matches, winning.etc barely dieing. those type of things.  Give it a shot, if your good with it its never a problem with match making at all Also adding - stock weapons are pretty good, i still own golds and silvers with it, not really your weapon, tactic/dodge.etc is the aim i do, i even try crouching time to time. Also a tip you should see if they have any perks like Blood clotting and more armor on them selfs, and change your tactic towards that 1 person, usually for the more armored and slow, i usually fire abit and hit them and reload as quick as possible, then full on kill them with the means to kill them.   Also dont go to Hong Kong server as it isnt in 'hong kong' its more in USA side, also it doesnt have many people in it. so i disagree ever going that server. Give it a shot Gamer!
848	1	a	Ignore all the people that say bad devs, it's a half truth. It has devs, and some updates, but it has very FEW devs. They are in Dev hell, play and support, its in a hole.   Play atleast, make friends, they will keep you playing. You don't have to spend money, atleast give them numbers so they can get support another way. This game can easily become number one.
6432	0	a	DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!  I played this game at oringinal launch as well as after it was 'reloaded'. It was great! 3rd person shooter with EPIC customization. Very much enjoyed playing.  Now heres the only reason you need to never play this game:  My account was banned due to 'cheating witnessed by someone'. No cheating involved ever yet I was banned. Read around its not just me. Many others have had accounts banned for no reason at all. Spent all the time leveling up, getting cool things, customized everything only have have my account perma banned for having one good night where I was dominating the fight clubs.  Save yourself the hassel and just never play this game unless someone who cares takes over. If you are good then you will be banned. (I dont play this on steam but writing a review everywhere I can to help prevent this happening to others)
6826	0	a	Horrible game didn't even install correctly. It wanted me to install physx which i did then it told me to restart my computer which i also did and it still didn't work. I uninstalled it and will never even touch this game with a 10 foot pole.
8796	0	a	this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ don't play it
10701	1	a	Idk what to do in this game other than killing creatures.  11/10
2132	1	a	People say this game is Pay To Win... But it's not, when i started to play this game i killed people that had Payed items which wasn't that difficult, However if you save money like me you can get really cool and good stuff from the shops in the game. For example if you spend real money on to the game its just giving stuff that looks better and its upgraded little bit too. I played this game for few hours and i am so close to get a really good car without spending no real life money. Hope this changed your mind about this game. :)
2882	1	a	Saw butts on a sign and uninstalled.
9619	0	a	This game is very old and unpolished at that.
7653	0	a	0.01/10  This game is one of the worst 3rd person shooter ever made. The developers don't listen to the community and what the community wants in the game. The over-pricing of guns and clothes in the ARMAS market is rediculous (DON'T BUY ANYTHING WITH REAL MONEY). The server lag is insane and sometimes hard to deal with. Also, the amount of hackers you see is stupid and made me want to hack sometimes. The only good thing about this game is the customisation feature, but you have to pay for a premium to add more than like 10 decals to your car. This game is extremely pay to win, if you want anything good you have to pay with real money to get it.  Looking back now, I don't see any reason of how i could have played it for as long as I did.  I will never play it again.  
3009	1	a	It's fo free and it's off da heezy!
8475	0	a	Doesn't even work. Says i have to verify my account, after i verify, it still says i have to verify. So i verify again, it says i still have to verify. So i verify... 
960	1	a	Fun game, although all servers are ghost towns. Nobody plays the game anymore which is sad.
6950	0	a	No, just No. Dont don't do it. Hell No.  Games going nowhere fast.  New pay2win gun every other to few months.  Only play fight club. Rest of the game is a repetitive driving item pickup simulator.
1579	1	a	Ok, very nice, but when i spend 1000$ for ammo, i can't use it!
3239	1	a	Really good free to play game and Specially if u like shoot guns and drive cars designe cars designe a caracther or more!
3691	1	a	yes i would pros free roaming ish you can rob you can be a cop or villian and more cons the frist wepon needs to be buffed beause of how little damage it does and snipers need to have scopes on most because most dont that i us i have got a pistol with ine but not a sniper and the way u play limited still yes i would
2602	1	a	GTA Online, free to play, nuff sed
8443	0	a	When this game was first released in stores and offered all content available to it's users, I heard nothing but great things about the game. Only downside was a smaller playerbase since many people simply have backed away from monthly payments for MMOs in the modern age of F2P (Free 2 Pay) games.  So eventually the game went F2P and moved onto Steam where I myself started playing it. Now it had a few bumpy issues such as having %30-%50 of the customization content blocked behind paywalls. But this was to be expected of a F2P game anyways.  Then the game slowly started changing...getting...corrupted...everything started costing money...the fun started to disappear as content was getting added slower...and slower...until the game was no longer the fun and customizable world that it promised to it's players. Now it is but a shell of itself, whispering...'pay me...paaaaay...meeee' in your ear at every opportunity.  10/10 wouldn't play again...
7686	0	a	* Brutal to new players * Laggy and unoptimized * Rampent Cheaters that make life a living hell. * Inactive Devs and GM's * DDoS attacked frequently.  If GamersFirst Developers became more transparent and seemed like they cared about their customers I would come back to this game after they fixed everything. This is true with their other games like Fallen Earth.
9379	0	a	You think from the screen shots its a cool mad max game, in reality, it was a pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.  Don't bother weekly rated this game, 'a huge pile/slice of don't bother'
8038	0	a	This game is very very P2W.  and If you don't believe me, go ahead, and you will find out that its very p2w during your first mission, you will have someone with a gun that takes you down with 2 shots, because he/she bought this gun on market place, but you start with probably one of the best free machine guns in game, and you have to put half of the magazine to kill someone, so stupid!
4132	0	a	Everyone uses grenades , it has unfair matchmaking and you know when it has a pack for $100 it's Pay 2 Win  Update : So it's been a year since my review so I thought I'd come back and try the game and it was awful , nothing has changed and the game feels even MORE broken than when I last played it , when I was trying to join a mission I was put against 3 players who were VERY experienced , I've only leveled up twice or something but I was going against guys that were in the Gold levels and had awesome gear while I was their with a crappy AK and 0 teammates , yes , the game wasn't giving me teammates. I just could not continue playing , it was so bad so after a year I can say this , it's worse than it was a year ago.
1222	1	a	I like the game its mostly like GTA so i think you sould get it.
10612	1	a	This game was good. Then Kabam bought it and it slowly became bad. And now a new company called 'Deca Games' bought it from Kabam. They did more work in 2 weeks than Kabam did in 3 years. I have hope and faith.   DECA MAKE ROTMG GREAT AGAIN, WE BELIEVE IN YOU!
5260	0	a	LIST OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO ME WITHIN TWO DAYS OF PLAYING: 1.) Ignored when i ask a question (that i see now as a very simple question to answer... like five words.) 2.) Openly expressed my feelings about only being to customize your car with a max of three shapes and got crucified. 3.) Met a group of four elite players with the same over powered weapon and wearing stockings and big ole baps! 4.) Made the mistake of trying to speak in chat like a normal human being. 5.) Look in chat and always see people yelling 'Hacker!' or 'Wow, nice wall hack!' 6.) AND SO MUCH MORE!  CONS: - The missions are ALL the same. - If you kick butt in the first two parts of a mission you need to win an all or nothing TDM skirmish or you don't get squat! - Friendly fire is ALWAYS on and the criminals and police both look the same (MEGA PENALTY IF TEAM KILL!). - Spawn kills - Poison community - Gave me more anger than joy. - Couldn't ask a friend to play this out of pure respect. - It IS pay to win! For real though! - Your only motivation is more petty trash to customize your character with!  - The game is built around customization yet restricts you to how much you can customize! WTF! - Made me want to kill myself and improved my life 100% when i stopped playing!  PROS: - Customization... rendered useless due to the poopynes of the game!
1138	1	a	This is ta best game ever ! i love him &lt;3
3857	0	a	it was fun but turned to â¥â¥â¥â¥ around a year ago and is showing no signs of improvements.  pros: - character and car editors are still unrivaled  cons: - greatly imbalanced gameplay - bad mission and level design - the worst community i've ever seen - huge performance issues - tons of hackers  may 21st 2015 UPDATE: game still bad

3264	1	a	fun, good customization, pleanty of cars, lots of clothing,customization scrolls, etc.
3819	0	a	APB is an interesting game with tons of potential and would be a wonderful game if it wasn't being developed by one of the worst companies in the industry.
3069	1	a	it's awsome
9510	1	a	I live my life by a moral code. I give games a chance to prove themselfs, but this game has broken my will to live. It looks like a child stuck in the 90s has mad this and is amazed by its visual aspects. The cancer in my eyes will forever burn. Thank you for this life lesson. I suggest everyone tries this game but have a friend presant so as to stop you from self harming.
8991	1	a	One of the greatest MMO's currently in the market. I've literally played EVERY AAA MMO out there and this one takes the cake. It might be free but they really know how to keep the fun factor in without having a 'pay me to unlock this feature' screen in your face. I haven't seen any difference between paid players and free players and that's why this game has my utmost respect.  You're a clone that survived the apocalypse. Your old self is dead but you (the clone) are alive. You need to find an antidote to ensure your survival and with that you go through many zones and fight many people/monsters to do it.  The game map is ENORMOUS. It'd literally take you 15 minutes to get from one town to another. There are hundreds of towns in the game. There are also thousands of quests in the game. It is impossible to beat the game within 100 hours as you'll be enticed to explore. You'll find a random bunker in the middle of nowhere and it'll eat at your curiousity. What is it doing there? You step inside and get in an elevator. It takes you down underground (without so much a loading screen, mind you) into a factory filled with mutants. This game is huge in every respect.  You can also craft almost anything and everything you see other players wearing. Every weapon, ammo, horse, car, farm, helmet etc. is craftable. Money is a bit difficult to come by which simulates the real world well.  This game is a MUST PLAY for every hardcore MMO gamer/MMO connoisseur. There is so much to do when you hit the higher levels. It's a sandbox in every respect - as a high-level player you will spend a lot of your time attacking and capturing territory for your faction. As a low level player you will spend a lot of time witnessing the warfare between factions as you level.

8450	0	a	This game was once a great creation with loads of potential.  While still an addicting game that i feel has mastered the art of virtual 'cops and robbers' gameplay, it is sadly neglected all too often by the very company that is failing to keep it under their control.  The game is very poorly optimized, leaving it laggy at times to the point of complete unplayability, reguardless of how powerful your computer is. The amount of cheaters/hackers that roam is more than alarming and quite possibly the most i have ever seen in any game i have ever played.  The fact it is free to play also means that any cheater that is caught and banned can just make a new account, rejoin, and be back to cheating again in less than 5 minutes. The fact players know this leads to an ever growing population of cheaters. There needs to be a better form of anti cheat which not only bans a cheater/hacker but also prevents them from returning.   The gameplay within itself, however, is a lot of fun, mastering each gun is a unique challenge in its own.  Playing with friends can lead to tears of laughter, as long as you dont take it all too seriously anyways.  The character customization possibilities are endless and probably my favorite part about this game, theres just an infinite number of ways you can customize your character.  Servers are constantly getting ddosed by hackers anymore and G1 appears to care very little about anything at all except for farming money of their, more often than not, armas products. Gamersfirst? more like Moneyfirst. They feed the community lies and broken promises so often its a wonder how the company is even still running at all.  This game is AIDS, plain and simple. STAY AWAY!!!

9474	1	a	Well wht can i say other than wow! ( no not world of warcraft ffs)   This game tests ur patience with some good old grinding, no not boring (NOTICE ''I SAID GOOD OLD GRINDING'') stop being negative already geez xD  So where was I... Oh yes! if u hav a brain and like sum crafting and sum action this game is soooooo what u need, if u have half a brain just pass coz this here is not for dumb people, ull hav loads of fun and the learning curve is easy and if ur really stuck u hav an online GM help line too :) which is helpful but dont go every 5secs n ask the same stupid SH*T coz ull get a full blast go play the game and figure it out a lil from a GM xD ( i totally agree with )  So u dont ask to be the best u learn to be the best thts final, the game is ruthless and nicely planned out, dnt go and expect to just get a vehicle lol u gta build 1 which is epic too coz hey the world is busted so scavenge get stuff and start with sum tyres and a frame etc etc ull hav the full reward of it in a good couple of hours :) so the crafting system is most awesome :)   Yes there is a few bugs etc but hey u ever played a bug free game that aint on console......? my point exactly  so give the game a whirl ull love it  8/10

6924	0	a	Some good things about the game :  - Best character creator I've ever seen  - Nice take on cops and robbers  - Great ways to customize clothing and vehicles  - You can create your own music  - Wide range of weapons and clothes  - Gameplay is fun for a while  - 2 reasonably big maps to play on  - Great leveling system  *Instead of actual levels, you level up contracts, that will reward you with new vehicles, clothing, weapons, customization options, and new contacts to level up.    Some bad things about the game :  -The game has a P2W (Pay-to-Win) feel to it  *Great weapons cost real money and are very overpowered compared to the in-game weapons  - F2P weapons are very similar  *Several of the same weapon, with different buffs  - FPS isn't very smooth unless you have a good PC  - Driving is a bit slow, reactions are off  *Turning has a very slight delay after pressing the key  - Absolutely terrible ranking system  *The game's 'Threat Level' is basically a ranking to show off your skill in matches.  *The game has districts dedicated for each rank (Gold, silver bronze) but players of that rank aren't forced to join one of those servers, resulting in a high amount of golds in silver districts (Very little, if any, silvers), and many golds/silvers in bronze districts (Few bronzes). This makes it hard for bronzes and silvers to level up.   The game is fun overall but being P2W ruins it for me. I don't know if many others have had a similar issue, but whenever the game is installed to my pc, it slows down my performance overall, but goes away once uninstalled. The game's worth trying out, but don't expect for it to be the greatest thing ever.
1805	1	a	fun, good customization, pleanty of cars, lots of clothing,customization scrolls, etc.

6419	0	a	My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.
9500	1	a	Never played this game steam says i have so....  Roasted pumpkin soup recipe  â¢ 1.5kg edible pumpkin â¢ Olive oil â¢ 1 teaspoon dried chilli â¢ 1 tablespoon coriander seeds â¢ 1 large onion â¢ 3 cloves garlic â¢ 1 carrot â¢ 1 stick of celery â¢ 1 litre hot vegetable stock  Preheat the oven to 170Â°C/340Â°F. Half the pumpkin and remove the seeds (you can keep these for roasting), then chop into wedges. Place the pumpkin on two large baking trays and drizzle over a little olive oil. In a pestle and mortar, grind the chilli and coriander seeds with a pinch of salt until finely ground. Sprinkle the spices over the pumpkin with some black pepper. Roast the pumpkin for 1 hour, or until soft and slightly caramalised at the edges.  Meanwhile, roughly chop the onion, garlic, carrot and celery. Heat a lug of olive oil over a medium heat in a large saucepan then add the vegetables and cook for 15 minutes, or until soft and sweet but not coloured.  When the squash is ready, add to the pan with the hot stock. Blend with a stick blender, adding a little more water if you like a thinner consistency. 
6088	0	a	Would be fun if balanced, but its not.  Pros: Its pretty almost like GTA, and you can drive a car YAY! And also pay money to look like, well a bunny, or something stupid like that. Thats it... Cons: Why a bunny? Because nearly every firefight ends with you being bunny hopped at close range. How many seats does the car have? WHY would that matter if you can simply ride on TOP of the car? Shooting at a car is fairly useless, tires dont blow out. Driver cant be killed unless they exit the car. You can then just bunny hop on them. The whole game is build around buying stuff on their annoying marketplace. Why give the player a choice of 5 FREE GUNS for 10 days, if they can simply go to the marketplace and try a BETTER gun for free for a day, theres more then 10 to choose from. The NPCs are useless. The only missions you do are random ones by selecting READY, that is not an RPG. Servers are unbalanced. Guns unbalanced. Half the time getting into your OWN car takes over 3 seconds. People shoot a grenade at your feet and arrest you, and you can do nothing. You play for 10 seconds, and then wait 30 seconds to respawn. There is no teamwork at all, just rushing the enemy 'beach of normandy style' till they die from being overwhelmed. Loading time is HORRIBLE, connecting to server takes forever, just to find out that there is only 3 people there and you need 4 to play. Weapons are kinda sad, lots of choices but are basiclly the same, you buy ammo manualy, cuz they gotta drain your in game money on something I guess. Thanks a lot. Sorry im tired of typing...
16	1	a	great game if you want to lose your hair and die early.  10/10
1006	1	a	this is a good game

9169	1	a	yes this game is fun but it would be better with a group of friends then you can work together and just have a better playing experience
603	1	a	1.Install 2.Make account 3.Start playing 4.Choose to be a cop 5.Get killed by a P2P criminal 6.Uninstall  10/10 Would arrest again
2105	1	a	One of the BEST games I have played. A lot of action packed shoot outs, you ahve to have a tactical mind to survice this ...and a little bit of luck :D . AWESOME options to customise you character or crew. A must have for a fan of shooter games and adrenaline rushes :3
2286	1	a	This game although old is very fun and easy to get into. You start with 2 of the best wpns in game and through progression obtain any weapon, car, clothing you would need to sucessful w/o spending and RL money. I would recommend this to anyone who likes shooter games. I have over 600 hours so far in the game and still enjoy it (played a bit outside of Steam)
2401	1	a	Its not Pay 2 Win , at first i thought so but if u spend some time in the game look up some methods to gain money everything is buyable
8055	0	a	The game on Steam is not the current copy of the game, so you have to spend extra time updating it inside of an application that launches the game itself. Then theres 6 splash screens, which aren't skippable. The game window does not fullscreen or even window properly, and does not lock the cusor.   The game then demands you to make an account on the publisher's website, and refuses to use a standard Steam login without linking it.   There are hackers absolutely everywhere you look, and they arent the subtle 'twitch to the head for a headshot' or a slight speedhack, im talking about them flying and jumping all over the place 1 shotting everything. What makes matters worse is that the premium players have weapons that mimic the hacker's weapons insanely well, so its often times impossible to spot an actual hacker until the blast off into the sky.  Naturally with all 'free to play' games, you can buy premium currancy that is often times required to actually progress further without spending day and days of your time just to get a slightly better machine pistol.  The only good side to this game is the car customization. Its a bit wonky, but it has more customization options than any other game that I've seen.   All and all: Disappointing buggy mess that the devs do not seem to care much about past making money from users.
8030	0	a	Accumlated 3.5k hours on this game. It's garbage, dont do it.
7537	0	a	Free 2 play pay 2 win game
5762	0	a	when it first came out i loved it, though i could only run it on 10 fps., now several years later with a new pc i tried it agian, and i have never been so disapointet... when you are new to the game you join pvp games where your teammates are just as â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ as you are, but your opponents is insanely high rank and ofc. also pay to win so even if you snipe them 5 times in head before they even see you, they just turn around and instagib you with ump or a handgun. so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing broken because of some greedy developers!
7703	0	a	they NEED to â¥â¥â¥â¥in make this compatible with windows 8!!!!!!!!!!!     
2767	1	a	i have never played this game
5383	0	a	You know a game is bad when you press the 'start' button and it just sends you to a Facebook page to leave a 'like'.
8802	0	a	TL:DR - You must be a masochist to take this game seriously.  Still a terrible shooter. Somewhat fun for the veterans, just the new pay2win guns make it hard to be enjoyable. Not to mention the hackers. There's an average of one or two per team on Fight Club, at weekends. Don't know about the action districts as I hardly play them, but it's safe to assume they are there as well. It's a game adored by hackers for some reason. G1 should legalize wallhack and everything to level the field.  Grind is less terrible than most F2P games, kinda of goes fast if you are dedicated. But it's hard to raise credits to buy anything, since the payouts for missions or the fight club are next to abysmal. Obviously there to help selling premium subscriptions/premium stuff.  To summarize, you must be a masochist to install this game and keep it, to take it seriously. Believe me, I was one of those maschists that wanted to have everything the game could offer back in 2011.   You may have one or two fun matches, then it's a neverending streak of awful matches that'll probably end up with a broken mouse or worse in a fit of rage. There isn't a friend I met in the game who doesn't have one of those nerd rage stories.
5520	0	a	A really stupid game with bad graphics, GTA III level bad, and you have to pay to even enjoy this game or else you just respawn... die and repeat  very infuriating, and very stupid people running it, the only good (and bad) thing about it is there is always new guns and stuff that's always better than what came before it, just to keep you buying more and more useless items with your hard earned money...   Oh yea, and don't glitch coz they ban you for that, and they see that it's not their job to fix it, it's your job not to exploit it... lol
6742	0	a	If you enjoy constantly being pitted against players far above your skill level without your say and losing many, many matches before you even get a grip on how the game works, then this is your game. The matchmaking system is so flawed, it has effectively driven away anybody who might pose a fair, but not punishing, challenge against you.   Because of the matchmaking, this game has two difficulties in essence: Stupid Easy and Stupid Hard. Pick your poison.  The gameplay itself doesn't have much to it. Just level up contacts, shoot at some players once in a while, and do the same set of fetch quest, ram raid, or deathmatch objectives pretty much every mission. That is the meat of the game, and it's not subject to negotiation The game is based around PvP, and normally, it would be something you could have a bit of fun with after gathering up a few friends and duking it out in the streets like you're supposed to. But then we come back to the matchmaking issue, which takes the aspect of 'fair competition' and chucks it straight out the window.   It's also not a very well optimized game. I can accept when a game is simply too intense for my PC to handle, but this game certainly shouldn't be on the list of 'I need to turn A LOT of settings down before I can play' games. I'm not running on a potato, either. It's just terribly optimized. So, word of warning, do not expect to run this at high and get smooth frames on anything less but the most rugged of gaming rigs with a lot of resources to burn.   The best thing I can say about it, really, is the customization. It truly is the one aspect that takes this mediocre game a step up into the realm of competitively mediocre. 'Course, don't expect to make any particularly insanely awesome character outfits without dropping real money or grinding the game's endlessly monotonous objectives, all while battling the world's worst player matchmaking system.  Until this game gets its crap together with the supposedly upcoming engine update, I can't recommend this title, even in its free-to-play format. Play it if you want, but prepare to get annoyed.
4985	0	a	lot of bugs...
8388	0	a	APB RELOADED Horrible Community. Useless Game Designers(since beta network issues) nothing more. NO. Uninstall. Shut Down Get rid Of.
5623	0	a	it sucks.
499	1	a	Steam is showing that i'm playing the game but actually i haven't played it for a week. Ty for the free hours.  Also customization is great 10/10
1267	1	a	I like APB:R because you could make your character as cute as possible or make it look ugly but anyway its a cops vs crims and APB:R have the best advanced customizing for characters but the only thing i dont like about it because their always have to be someone complaining or calling out hackers and stuff like that.    APB:R is a cool game for steam :D
3454	1	a	This game, although heavy with pay-to-win content, is extremely fun. I'd highly recommend it.
6617	0	a	It looks like a real good game but the vehicle handling is very poor.   Also, it is hard to learn to play as a newbie. You won't know who's who and will keep running out of bullets. Other players who are a higher level will come in and blast you out of existance, because they have more powerful weapons. Most of the weapons seem to be overpowered, (only been on the wrong end of them of course).  The GPS is next to useless, so unless you know the map, you have a hard time finding your way around.  Other players won't let you play your own game, or won't leave you alone, killing you on sight for no other reason than you are on the side of the law / or the side of the criminals, (as soon as you've ready'd up).   My advice is to make friends with other more experienced players ASAP then you might stand a chance.   I did team up, but the players I teamed up with were also at the mercy of more experienced players. It makes this game a real pain in the â¥â¥â¥ and a waste of time to play.   Very little rewarding gameplay at the start, makes this an awful game to play as a newbie. You will get bored with being killed time and time again!  I spent two hours dying all the time and got so fed-up with the silly car handling that I am giving up on this game for now. 2014-08-17.   Sign-in - Sign up problems. (With GamersFirst). I also played this before when it first came out, I was annoyed that I had to go through the sign up process all over again, and even though I know my email and password, it refused them and I had to start again. When it came to my username, it won't let me have it, claiming it is already in use! (Well, yes it is - BY ME), but it won't let me sign in with the my original username anymore.  Overall:- a waste of time. I do not recommend it!
3096	1	a	love this game, honestly thought it would be bad but it is so amazingly fun to play with mates or by urself.
8582	0	a	If you want to rage quit download this game, if not go find another game.
10085	1	a	A really fun post-apocolyptic mmorpg that involves quite the amount of mechanics, however this game is not very fun solo, well neither is any mmo. I would recommend this f2p mmo for just how fun it is in the first place even in solo, I would of course enjoy to have more friends play the game and making it easier to find them (you'll be surprised how hard it is to find your friend). I also enjoy the fact that it has a night and day cycle, but too many microtransactions (of course) makes the gameplay less apealing to those who doesn't want to 'waste' money on a f2p game, but at the end of the day, it still remains to be a fun game to play.
6743	0	a	PLEASE DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS GAME !!!! This game was really bad, i think this game same like GTA. But, this game just like trash with big size on my PC. And also, the customize characters doesnt like Saints Row. And I really hated about lag connection.
1274	1	a	gud game, the money is a pain in teh â¥â¥â¥â¥ doe, freakin â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥es stealin from my car/van :C
9740	0	a	WORST GAME EVER F2P more like p2w AND WORST GAME IVE EVER PLAYED â¥â¥â¥â¥ THE DEVELPOPEFLEKN. DO NOT PLAY THIS PEICE OF SH**!
2389	1	a	The only game I know where I can customize my car to be hot pink with SWAG written in bold print on the front and play bumper cars inside the parking lot.  Everything else is poor mans GTA in MMO form.
10528	1	a	Personally my favorite game but i will be unbias. Its a very fun and addicting game. It takes time to build up but once you get there its good til you die. The game is a game where you can die and lose that character for ever, so its best to play hard but safe.
5110	0	a	I am going to compare this to GTA Online or Saints Row as it is that style of gameplay  1. Acess to fun:  GTA Online, I have to boot up the game, click on online, I'm in and I can blow up cars.  Saints Row, I have to boot up the game, join a friend, start the game, I'm in and I can blow up cars.  In APB Reloaded, I have to boot up the start menu, update the game, start up the game itself (Which sometimes opens up a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Facebook 'like this' page and you have to click Start again), Then select the character, then join the correct district then select the spawn and then have no idea where to go because you selected the wrong district and have no idea where to go.  Character Customisation:  In GTA Online it is the worst character creation ever, you choose the grandparents and parents and that's how your characer looks like, no wonder my character looks like â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t  In Saints Row 3 and 4 the customisation is great. It leaves enough options to be extremely customizable but few enough to be simple  In APB Reloaded it is like Saints Row but the camera angles are confusing, the advanced mode gives too many options while the quick mode gives too little options. It is the worst of both worlds.  And that's as much of the game I know of. As it took too long to get any-â¥â¥â¥â¥ing-where with the game as it was complicated and boring to figure out where to go.
9538	1	a	it's a good game!!! 
1146	1	a	I Love the game becuse it is like cops and robs 
1445	1	a	very good game, no frame drops and no problems... + amazing hitreg
6860	0	a	This game is all good except for the fact that I got a bug from it where it tells my friends that I am playing APB all the time, regardless of what I'm playing now. It also wont let me delete it because of the fact that it still thinks that I am in-game.
392	1	a	You shoot people, you get money. You get money, you kill people! What else do you want?
10881	1	a	More of an action game with progression than an MMO. It's a fun little game that can easily suck your time away, especially if you're a fan of shmups or games with light RPG elements.  Try it out if you want something new. Besides, it's only about 50 mb big.
3707	1	a	Is a fun game best to play with friends
10224	1	a	Definitely fun. Post apocalyptic MMOFPS with crafting and vehicles. It can get pretty deep. Graphics are just OK, but the game is fun so I never notice. It's also free to play.
6905	0	a	pay2win game with a â¥â¥â¥â¥ ton of hackers  although it's probably the best of it's genre with the features provided in the game, it's still shitinfested with tons of faggs and a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ dev team  tons of faggs, meaning that the game has probably one of the worst communities in mmo history
9319	0	a	Hard to follow missions with rude players who are really into it just to troll the ***k out of you continuously until you either quit playing or get good enough to beat them to death in return.
8904	1	a	i actually enjoyed playing this game, it is different, but i think it is still a bit too buggy for my taste, getting stuck in the respawn tube or transporting, or even just on pebbles in the road this needs an update badly to fix some issues then it would be awsome like fallout on crack, but now its fallout if fallout was that one 'special' student we all had in our class growing up, but still i think it is very much worth a try, the devs should open it up to allow fans to maybe help them make better and newer patches for the game, just an idea
9350	1	a	did noot even work 4 me :'( i hat dis gam   lick if u cryi evry tim
5792	0	a	This game could be so good. But. greedy devs, bad community, no community, P2W, no beginner support, lack of playable content, no new content, laughable matchmaking, small maps, few maps, free guns suck, free guns are temporary, level system sucks, unlockables are well locked, ect... I could go on probably but whats the point its all written in other reviews. I do hope some how, some way, this game gets put in the hands of people more capable and returned to the relm of f2p, because unless all you plan to do is customize you character or melody or clothes or car or emblems, ect... you have to Pay to Win. I cant reccomend a game that cant be played. So hurry up and fix it!
3624	1	a	I &lt;3 This G ame So much!! So much fun kind of like GTA V
3747	0	a	The most toxic community I have ever met.
9568	1	a	holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game is so good. open. great combat. smooth. addicting. yeah get it. â¥â¥â¥â¥ the negative reviews lol this game is awesome. IT EVEN HAS GREAT LIP SYNC GUYS. PLEASE. THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥ MADE ME GET THE MINDSET TO PLAY GAMES THAT ARE ''REVIEWED'' NEGATIVELY AND TRY IT MYSELF FIRST AND HAVE MY OWN OPINION ABOUT IT. but i do read the positive reviews first to put myself up and the game.
7113	0	a	It sucks now... why? BECAUSE OF THE STUPID LAUCHER REFUSING TO WORK! Don't waist a total of 2 hrs of repairs and stuff plus solutions are useless. END OF STORY
792	1	a	Pros+++ +Character creation. +Customization. clothes,vechile,songs,etc. +Decent graphics. +Vehicles. +Lot of challenge. (Its not enough u know how to aim, u cant just run centre of street!) +Can find kind player too, true nerds, u can even buy zelda songs!  Cons--- -Matchmaking!! (U have to join bronze district if u silver or lower threat!) -Toxic/cheating community like most of competive games. -Devs dont to right thinks to improve game. -Some of guns are bit p2w. -Sometimes game lag when it get ddosed. -Car spawnz are op! -Fog of war. -No headshots. -Mission reward low without premium.  Still better game than cs go.
8242	0	a	bad drive big bogs :D and were is cover :D
9417	1	a	I see this time and time again. A new player joins and quits after about a few hours, not giving the game enough time to fully understand it. This game is very good what i like the most about it is the ability to build your character's stats almost any waay u want to. also the crafting is very in depth and almost like no other mmo. i recommend giving this game a try.
6149	0	a	He stole my car. He drove my car ( that I spent thousands of dollars customizing) into a ditch. My car exploded. He died. I quit.  9/11 community is toxic (10/10 for the uninstall button)
3685	1	a	Please, update car physics
1588	1	a	GREAT NOT PAY TO WIN YOU CAN BUY GREAT GUNZ INGAME 100% worth brathaz TRUST ME WHEN I FIRST PLAYED THIS I SAID OH â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS PAY TO WIN â¥â¥â¥â¥ BUT I GOT IN TO IT I HAVE EVERY THING AND NEVER PUT ANY REAL MONEY IN TO THIS GAME 
2763	1	a	Is laggy tho.
822	1	a	Action stuff there.
8627	0	a	looks terrible is terrible the only thing good is that it is free
10136	1	a	I'm not quite endgame yet, but I'm definitely far enough in to offer an informed opinion. I HIGHLY recommend Fallen Earth for the compelling stories (even the side quests are pretty captivating at times), advanced crafting, and outstanding player base. Since you've heard rants already, I'll clear up things I feel the other comments got wrong instead:  - This is a post-apocolyptic RPG, but beyond that it has little in common with Fallout. The crafting in Fallen Earth is much more advanced and takes longer (days, sometimes). The V.A.T.S. combat system we know and love from Fallout is not used. Most importantly, the actual story is completely different. So if you want F2P Online Fallout, you're going to miss the mark a little.  - It is nearly impossible to 'accidentally wander into' a PVP zone. You will be warned if you approach one and the map marks it with a glaring red zone. In the off chance you're blind enough to wander into one, players above that zone's max level are excruciatingly penalized for being there. So don't worry, you aren'y likely to be killed by another player until you're ready.  - Admittedly, the game is hard to get used to without a guide. There's no sugar-coating it. You know what they say about learning to ride a bicycle, though.  - Finally, while this is just my personal opinion, I think it's hard to consider crafting a hassle when you can literally keep playing while you craft. That engine your building will continue its construction while you shoot blight wolves and collect scraps.   Enough from me, download and try it. I certainly didn't regret doing so. 9/10
5876	0	a	You like Hackers, Pay2Win, No matchmacking and unbalanced game ? This game is for you !
1794	1	a	love this game!
6471	0	a	Are you serious. Game cant even run for 20 minutes before it crashes my computer and I'm forced to power cycle the damn thing. Graphics are at lowest of low settings too. As low as you can go even though I can run the game at higher settings....still crashes. I was pretty excited to play this game too. Well thats gone now. Back to Arma 3!
10796	1	a	Its ok
1875	1	a	Really love the game. :)) 10/10 :))
1816	1	a	The game is realy nice i love it :3
7796	0	a	This game, haha, let me get started. This game is a good game, I like the concept of the game, but it is purely, Pay to Win. The tutorial helps you little to none, I had a hard time figuring out how to even change cloths, it's also REALLY buggy. Besides after spending 15 hours on one character I got banned by Punkbuster for having, 'A Bad Driver' on my computer, this game in my opinion is a waste of time and space.
6453	0	a	This game looks like the best game ever created, but it's a swift, hard kick in the balls once you start playing. It's pay2win, the missions are impossible, the shooting sucks â¥â¥â¥, and it seemed to me like I was the only cop and everyone else was playing as the criminals.
4093	0	a	The only way you could have fun is by paying the micro transactions. All in all, this is pay 2 win.
5254	0	a	it is a free gta
8506	0	a	Just a load of horse â¥â¥â¥â¥
10465	0	a	To be honest you could tell they were trying to meke this game exactly like Fallout NV or 3 but its whatever. The controls seem a little slow and unresponsive. The quests do seem fun but don't really have much taste.  
22	1	a	APB Reloaded summed up, is a roller-coaster of a game. There will be days were you are on fire and loving the game. Then there will be days were nothing is going right, and youâre wondering why you ever tried the game out in the first place. I canât tell you if itâs a good game or not, thatâs your decision as a person. What I can tell you is this. If you go into the game expecting to win a lot and go super saiyan youâre in for a load of hurt. But if you go in to the game just to have some fun or blow off some time, who knows you might be in for a surprise. Yes winning is a lot more fun than loosing but winning isnât everything. Give the game a try, itâs free. I mean what do you have to lose? Time?
10816	1	a	good game but it will take a cople of trys to get to max lvl for every charnter
6312	0	a	Fun game but can only play when my parents are not home, so it is not worth my time to play.
6527	0	a	despite what the above may say i do not recommend this. EDIT: you can put not recommended now, so that's nice
10545	0	a	Used to be a great game, now a sh*ty pay-to-win with microtransactions everywhere.
770	1	a	This Game is Awesome. The Unlimited Customization of Character And Cars makes it total worth a try. You create your own Identity or you copy an existing humanoid character from anywhere. Such as Ronald McDonald as an Example. I total Recommend this game if you like GTA and FPS Games
2985	1	a	While the character creator, theme song composer and the car/tattoo/clothing/logo customisation is top-notch, the lack of a true PvE venue of advancement might be a turnoff for some fans of traditional well rounded MMO experiences. If you love MMOs mainly for the PvP and competitive aspect however, then this is a really solid modern setting title that has decent replay value.  I reccomend you grab a friend before heading out on the town, it is easy to get overwhelmed quickly without some backup!
4372	0	a	THIS GAME SO BAD ITS NOT A FAR GAME YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR EVERYTHING I WAITED 2 HOURS TO PLAY THIS
8465	0	a	Had fun for many hours, until I realized that I kept on getting beaten by lvl 1's because they decided to be P2W and buy rocket launchers and all kinds of crazy â¥â¥â¥â¥.  This game is 80% P2W, and 20% actual fairness.
1684	1	a	Epic! i recommend it
2197	1	a	Love tHis GTA Based Free To Play Game :)
4217	0	a	If you like hackers, then this is the game for you!
2727	1	a	It's a tough game. Hard to learn te dynamics and when you really hit someone. It's a very cool game... something like GTA but only with players, including the Police!!! :D Everyone who likes GTA will have some real fun with this one!
6352	0	a	Me and my friends got it to play together. We spent 5 minutes in it then left. 11/10 IGN
4100	0	a	Community. Enough said.
930	1	a	Definitely a game with a lot of potential.. Although their servers are a bit dusty, it doesn't mean that the game isn't worth trying out. You can spent a lot of hours just trying to customize your character, running around like a cop or a criminal. If it's possible, try to get some of your friends to play it with you. I wouldn't say that you need to play with friends, but games are always funnier when you can play them with your friends! (:
3692	1	a	i played the game for 12 hours and i think to my self this is a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ fun canda game for poeple like me of mmo's and mmorpg's and moba's i don't like the game but i like a bit of it i grown on me to play the game i hope the fix the car's driving error's that i have who can drive like that i recommend playing it on your own risk if you like this game i like to â¥â¥â¥â¥ around with this game and â¥â¥â¥â¥ all the player 'up' and ya msg me if you like it but not realy like it
262	1	a	Great game that requires alot of skill, Its a amazing game if you don't worry about a hacker here and there and dieing some! :D
6505	0	a	Worst game ever. Bad severs, bad steering (for cars), almost everything is bad. I don't understand why people plays it when you can't even do stuff properly.
3598	1	a	You're kidding me, only now then they add it on steam.
5181	0	a	i'd rather cut my own nipples off while playing a violin made out of raw buttcheek than to play this game. its booty
2779	1	a	This game is a great MMO. Be a crimilnal and rob people or be a vigilante and stop the criminals. Play with me on the server thats closet to your location ;)
4345	0	a	Extremely laggy, and is not recommended for weak computers.
3310	1	a	Very fun, very exciting and it makes me hard! This game has so much to it, there is almost never something to not do, but warned little wallets, they vant ur moneyz I do not recommend purchasing ANYTHING for this game, it's a free game, it's fun to keep it that way
2887	1	a	A really fun game, have played since the original from Real Time Worlds was released. I would recommend to have a great computer with the minimum of 4 GB of RAM to play this. Apart from this, the sandbox environment of cops and criminals makes anybody happy. Just word of advice, don't play this game if you are easy to become angry.
7997	0	a	(Refer to my profile picture)
3177	1	a	its cool but not that cool 
6795	0	a	This game sucks balls. wont update
10309	1	a	Allo poppets, anuva reveiw...  So... Fallen Earth, an MMORPG set in post-apocalyptic america, original I know, but the the game itself is, actually quite unique, if a bit lacking in areas. Having only limited tim on this one so far I can say this for sure, it could be so much more than its is, visually and in actual gameplay. Thats not to say it isnt still a good game and enjoyble thus far.  The storyline seems fairly original (to me at least), and the character creation is fairly in depth, skills and progression of characters are simple and fairly rapid, but the thing that really set this one apart is the XP system which i will describe in detail below.  In Fallen Earth you start as a clone in a lab and must 'break free', but once you are free of the lab, the wasteland of the Grand Canyon, USA, has much to offer in the way of chr. progression options, meaning you dont have to be a warrior, or combatant of any kind (though you will need to be able to defend yourself), you can make a living and progress in Lvl &amp; skill by travelling the wastes and scavenging, harvesting and collecting supplies and refuse of all kind, and, either crafting/building things from them or just selling them.  The combat and equipment system is pretty cool (although complicated at first), as you can choose a wide array of weaponry to equip and even use in combination i.e; Pistol in one hand and blade in the other or sword and axe etc., which I found very fun. Most weapons and armour can be crafted with the neccessary skill, and clothing/armor can even be dyed for an extra touch of personalisation.  There are also many Mounts, pets, and vehicles to accompy you, or be used throughout your travels in the wastes, and you don't have to pay real money to get them, though the best ones are only on the market. Nor do you have to pay real cash to get/tame pets, just spend game 'chips'(the currency of the wastes) to get the corresponding item, i.e; Wasteland Hound Leash will allow you to obtain/tame a dog/wolf pet.  The only downside as I touched on earlier is the fact that its very 'un-polished' thus far, some part of dialogue texts are even grossly miss-spelt or nonsensical, and it gets a little glitchy in some areas, especially when there is a heavy populatio of players in-game. This lack of 'finesse' does detract quite a bit from the game, however, as you can see the great potential this title has, hopefully coming updates will fix these issues.  When alls said and done this is , at least, worth a look due to the involved Role-play aspect and wide exploration capabilities, just dont expect a highly polished experience...  I'm rating it 5.5 out of 10 Red Poker Chips
8275	0	a	10/10 would uninstall again
6281	0	a	  What aload of crap
6255	0	a	Wont even let me play,everytime I click 'play' it says APB:Reloaded (Not Responding)
3600	1	a	I love this game, it is a very good game, and you don't have to pay real money to get anything if you're willing to just play the game. All of these people say it feels like a GTA clone, because it almost it! That's the point of it, the game is amazing, but expect it to take up a lot of your time, and be frustrating when somebody has a free trial gun.
9831	0	a	this game is so fliping gay i cryied brcaues how fliping lame it is  ^  dat grammer
3526	1	a	I really wish this game was controller compatible.
5015	0	a	Desparately needs some F2P servers, i've been in to far too many situations where I (as a bronze and silver, for a short time) have been put up against max rank golds with fully decked out characters. guns and cars. This game has absolute zero balance and unless you funnel half your life savings into their premium currency, you have no chance of getting anywhere.  Here's a tip for new players and people who are not vey good at FPS games; avoid the missions altogether, you'll be slaughtered every time an enemy spots you now matter what server/district you're on. The learning curve for this game isn't much of a curve, more like a vertical line.
969	1	a	i recommend this game. its like a free gta..
328	1	a	No engine updates and cheaters, game is quite great tho, shame see such potential go to waste. But still recommend it.
62	1	a	Jesus guys. I'm just going to be honest with you- stop looking for bad reviews. Its a free to play game, so just download it and play it. If you don't like it, then delete it. What is the worst that could happen anyways?  The hackers? Ok now for real, there are hackers in like every game. I even met an aim-bot hacker in CS:GO. So stop complaining about the hackers because any game can be easily hacked.  Oh, so you just spawned in and you died by a grenade? Big deal! Someone buys CS:GO and gets sniped by an AWP they automatically refund the game? No! They just get better at the game. And if you really need it just click on the 'Advanced' option while picking a district and click on one with a green orb next to it.  So just get the game and if you don't like it delete it.

10487	1	a	Fun game I recommend it because it will keep you busy for hours and its like a poor mans Fallout
5283	0	a	The game is absolute trash. It's no fun. The only way it keeps players is making them addicted. And making them hope one day they'll get that engine update. You will expect most people that play this game have no friends which you always have to expect. The community is is just horrific and unexplainable. The custimization is to primitive and needs to be improved. The graphics are insanely outdated. The gameplay is repetitive. The weapons don't even make sense.   Don't play this game if you don't want to waste your life. I do not recommend this game at all. It might say I played for only 300 hours. But that was when I got steam. I've played this game for over four years and I regret all of it. There is better games out there. Just steal your mom's credit card and you will get games that have the best they can offer.
1335	1	a	Awesome game but needs a ton of new updates. It's the same thing over and over again. G1 needs to add newer vehicles, maps, and so on. Still addicting though lol. The community is just..... -face palm-
6773	0	a	The most Pay 2 Win game ever created in Universe, if you like to be killed in 0,05 sec by a Player who bought premium weapons than this is your pick! Enjoy repetative missions while being called noob cause you didn't pay to win, unload 7 clips of ammo in to one guy who then kills you with 2 shots from a pistol. Only thing that is fine in the game is costumization options. This game is the worst crap ever ressurected to be a Money Milking Machine. Don't play this game.
841	1	a	it is awesome have hade a lot of fun in the past and now time kill cops
3812	0	a	Pros: + Free to play + Kinda like GTA Online + Fun to ram pedestrians + I can play Pokemon GO Song and ram stuff  Cons: - Microtransactions - You need to pay to actually get some kills - Microtransactions - Did I mention microtransactions?  Edit: Forgot to mention the microtransactions.
6529	0	a	Pay to win? Pay to customize yoursef? Pay to customize your car? Pay for more decals on your car? Pay for more weapons? Pay for more damage?   Hell, Its basically a pay to play game.
6082	0	a	I dont recommned thsi game, beacuse the downloading in launcher is 25 KB/s and i played it 2years ago and was â¥â¥â¥â¥
6457	0	a	i hate this
8358	0	a	Too mutch P2W
3470	1	a	Trash.
521	1	a	Many people consider APB: Reloaded as a P2W game but it really isn't its more skill based you can kill maxed ranked players that own ARMAS Marketplace weapons with the starting gun. The default gun given is the most balanced gun in the game good for long range and close ranged. The Apparent P2W guns are obtainable for rent without paying but require Joker Tickets which you can obtain from fight club. Honestly I feel like this game is not P2W more like you need Skill2Win I would recommend APB to any other gamer out there.   People also forget the positive parts about APB: Reloaded which includes the games detailed character design. The customization in APB is by far one of the best due to the ability to make individual symbols and then place those symbols anywhere on a piece of owned clothing, car or graffiti. Regarding the Symbol editor you have amazing artwork for purchase from other players with in game money that could be tattoos, clothing details, car logos, anime characters, nsfw, guns, and other things.   Positives: - Great customization - Fun - Mailbox at Social District - That nice tingling sensation when you beat a maxed rank gold - Combat is more strategic then a point and click to kill shooter - GM's hold events occasionally and distribute GM Joker Boxes - Fight club for those who like instant action - Variety of guns in which each gun counters another just got to be smart on what you choose  Negatives: - About 1/3 of the cool clothing is armas - The fastest car in game with nitro is as fast as a potatoe (Feels like the max speed is 100kmph) - Occasional server lag - In game 13 yr olds that teabag - occasional hacker   Overall I rate APB: Reloaded 8/10
1741	1	a	even tho their are hackers this game is great fun just to mess around on the phusics are comical i love this game
9776	0	a	This game has horrible button layout and the story makes no sense
7267	0	a	I cant even get the game to load! the launcher has MANY, MANY problems that need fixing. even when I can get past the launcher the game wont load, so I dont really have any oppinion towards the game/gameplay but this game need alot of help. I also asked a friend how he got the game to work because i saw him playing it, but he replied with 'I havent even gotten it to work, ive just been stuck in the launcher trying to fix it'
3901	0	a	Buggy mess that's seriously in need of VAC support.
6413	0	a	THIS IS OUT DATED BY 20 YEARS
2630	1	a	Really needs controller support.. But for a F2P game, it's ruddy impressive!  I'm normally pretty harsh when assessing F2Ps but with this, I'm officially hooked :D
6615	0	a	played this game before it was on steam and left cameback after awhile and left for good this time. This game is   HEAVILY   p2w it seems like, you have your 3 districts 2 fighting disctricts and 1 social district and you have fight club maps, the 'rank' system is based off of losing and winning which is dumb because if you go against p2w players you will lose you won't even have a chance the servers are kindaorienated towards your 'rank' you have green servers bronze servers and so on the hackers ruined this game p2w really ruined it not to mention all the lag respawn sometimes seems like it takes forever and fight club matches are extremely hard because of the lag and p2w players all the guns you get with in-game currency go away after a few days so yeah don't waste your time with it. -100/10
227	1	a	APB Reloaded is a mass-multiplayer 'sorta open world' third person shooter/objective based game. I find it very fun in my opinion and even better when you're playing online with a good group of friends. The objectives vary, and I find them enjoyable as well as not too reptetative, the only problem I think this game has is that the enforcer role seems to be a little too OP when they are equiped with a tazer/stun gun. I know people counter this by stating that criminals do make money quicker, but I still think that the stun gun is rather unfair. However, this is just my opinion and someone else may feel differently towards it. But, if massive-multiplayer, online, third-person shooters sounds exciting to you, than this game is perfect.
9484	0	a	Just not my type of game. I dont like the way I have to switch between combat mode and having to switch back to do anything else with the mouse. Graphics could be better.
6498	0	a	Fun game ruined by hackers
2238	1	a	Nice game, still playing it. Playing this cuz cant buy GTA V... and its fun
8735	0	a	Created by wallets first. It is purely Pay to Win. You also get matched with people who are a higher threat level than you making it completely unfiar.
7633	0	a	This game is lame. You can try it, but it'll gona be a dissapointment.
3190	1	a	cooooool nice games of open world games
1320	1	a	lemme get this out first: THIS IS A FREE TO PLAY!!! The community is 50-50 (good-sucks) and many people are pay-to-win. But if you put enough effort, you'll find yourself fragging enemies in no time.
4285	0	a	This game is piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ community â¥â¥â¥â¥ forum â¥â¥â¥â¥ developer useless admins  download the game get error 8 post in forum *no replies*
7559	0	a	This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥, it crashes like crazy... and i couldn't even start it.. no wonder it's free... DO NOT DOWNLOAD.
718	1	a	it doesnt start ? i had the same problem , so what could i do ? i went online and dowloaded it from gmaerfirst online its run a little lagy at time thats cuase my computers shityy and my bro plays t aswell. custimisation is AMAZING i spent 5 hours on this and a long long long LONG time playing having fun , issions, and money , obioslly it cost a little bit for good things but i havent spent â¥â¥â¥â¥ and im still enjoying it .
4037	0	a	Game is so unbalanced, you have gold level players playing on bronze servers, hackers everywhere,toxic community who will try and defend this game to the death, whiny people who whisper about reporting you and how they're going to 'hack you' and then block you, enforcers using less than lethal guns that are magical and can stun you in 2 seconds, the market place for this game is also terrible, if you want to pay2win it's expensive, with special guns that cost ~40$ to buy just buy forever on a single charcter, and chances are if you play this game enough you will get banned. Such a terrible game 0/10.
6105	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥iest piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ I have ever let my â¥â¥â¥â¥-observing eyes lay upon.   1. I've gotten up to 400 hours on this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥. 2. It's absolutley all pay to win. You have no-lifes who pay 50$ to use overpowered guns that only last 14 days, along with Premium and money bought perks and cars.  3. They banned me for wearing a swatzika, and I was not notified, and apparently it was 'offensive' yet, they say they don't ban for symbolism. (The Customer Support is absolutley â¥â¥â¥â¥ in the fact that they gave me an equivilent punishment to whawt they give hackers and cheaters). 4. The maps are absolutley stale and â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ boring. You'll be wandering around a lifeless city going up to windows and doors clicking F, picking up items, go to zone A and B, defend for your entire experience.  5. Customization is extremley limited due to 'Premium', in which you can barely create and symbols, and customize your cars and character. 6. Again, you have to repay for a gun every 14 days, which mean constant, brainless grinding of cash for another â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ gun that is about the same as all other guns unless you pull out your â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ wallet and throw money at these money â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s. 7. The game is extremley outdated with â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ graphics, gameplay, and is just so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing stale.  8. The people who dedicate themselves to this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ just throw money at their screens, thats it. 9. Gamersfirst has taken no effort to revive the stale experience of this game, instead of years to improve a stale piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ game that â¥â¥â¥â¥ing died until they had to 'Reload' it up, nothing has changed, except a woopty-doo 'SERVER-MERGE' YAY. 10. Its hypocritical- You have adult players wearing inapropriate â¥â¥â¥â¥ and half naked all the time, yet when a 'swatzika' is spotted, they PERMA-â¥â¥â¥â¥ING-BAN-YOU. 11. The driving mechanics are stale as â¥â¥â¥â¥ and boring, just drive and shoot â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥es THATS ALL. 12. PVP combat is as stale as a piece of weat toast, its â¥â¥â¥â¥ing auto asist your aim and is just un logical and stupid.  13. â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game.
2907	1	a	It is like GTA but online. I don't pay for money or do missions I just drive around like a â¥â¥â¥â¥. Not bad for relieving stress.
9131	0	a	The game is all right I suppose. It is an open world game that is based around the Fallout series. Though Fallen Earth is a much more boring experience in my opinion. When I finished the tutorial, the beginning video made the game look bigger than it actually was. The graphics are terrible and the HUD was just all over the place. It was too lagy, and even on the lowest graphics settings possible for my computer. I do not recommend this game.
7605	0	a	Game is okay, nothing spectacular though
3847	0	a	I love this game. I love the customization it grants you. I love playing with friends.  Sadly, the gamebase is full of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s, granting you the title of 'noob', even though you try your hardest. 3/10
5593	0	a	I'll keep this simple. Bad graphics, gameplay, customization, and community. Mostly positive? Whoever's given this game a positive rating needs to seek professional help immediately. Avoid and go play GTA 5.
9652	1	a	this game isnt actuallt free to play :( 
10387	1	a	It takes a while to update, but it's worth every second of waiting.
817	1	a	Imagine if you put aids and terminal cancer together, then made it a game this is what would come out of it.   Welcome to AidsPointsBulletin one of the worst managed free to play games you've ever seen. Bundled with the worst anti cheat anyone has ever seen in their life and players with brains as equally as smart as dead sperm cells.
6609	0	a	its not as fun as they make it out to be
9804	0	a	I played it. Got renamed to a ridiculous name because my name offended the you know who. Then the same mod who had renamed me popped up in main chat to ask people to keep the discussion to game related Q&amp;A. I wasnt even chatting at the time, and the people who were were simply chit chatting. Apparently this is too much for this concentration camp of a game. No fun allowed. Only talk about the game.  I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hate this â¥â¥â¥â¥. Burn down every game company that manages its users like stupid cattle. God forbid giving personal details or talking about fun stuff. It might create you know, DISCUSSION. We dont want that. We want stupid morons who only talk about the game and pay their dues. Die. Eat it and die.
1300	1	a	You'll regret spending money in this game. A little, too much money.
8967	0	a	this game is VERY incomplete. the game needs more sound theres hardly any and this makes for an underwhelming game, i also think that the controls are a bit much and also very odd (i.e Y being the action/interact button). However for the most part the character design was pretty awesome and the only thing i think they should do to it is add a few more clothing options.
4732	0	a	This game has been trash since it was in beta before 'reloaded' don't waste your time.
9498	1	a	p good around lvl 15 for some reason it turns into an enormous grind that lasts 200 years  
8886	0	a	  There once was a good dev studio icarus who made this game, and they made it really well, the core game is awesome. Huge world to explore, somewhat interesting story, there's about 400 hrs of pve content, after that you'll ask yourself what's next? Well right now the answer is nothing, with population so low there's no pvp going on, which is actually really fun, even though hard to learn how to do it properly.   This game is not pay to win, I mean I really enjoyed game at first and bought steam package, I don't regret getting it, you can purchase subscription or buy tradeable premium for ingame currency, I bought a lof of them, I always had commander premium and it wasn't hard to earn enough game currency for it, there're multiple ways to make money in game, pve and pvp(but that's not the case now probably as population dropped heavily). I like the game so much that I would even pay for subscription anyway if not one but, and that's a big one, the G1, who bought the game doesn't develop it anymore, they keep 3 or 5 ppl on the staff and they do very little in game, it feels very abandoned. There's no anticheat and there's also ways to dupe in game, they can't fix that, even though some dupers sent them mail telling how to fix it, but they didn't do anything.  it's no longer an mmo, more like a bunch of ppl online, on top of that they downgraded their servers a few times, so there's much more lag, the content that G1 did is unfinished, and it's just a dead side of the map where nothing happens, they ruined the game and as long as they own it I can't recommend this game.  
9188	0	a	WORST F2P ON STEAM, LOOKS LIKE A PAY-TO-WIN WITH GRAPHICS THAT MY NETBOOK COULD HANDLE.
8143	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this â¥â¥â¥â¥ the game is fake you w8 3 houreews to download and then you can even launch the game...
2736	1	a	great game if you don't mind disconnecting every 30 minutes or so on the weekend. do not play this game during summer, or only play around 6-9 AM EST, when all of the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ 12 year old brats are asleep. during school season, 4-11 AM EST is a decent time block for playing, since they're all passed out by then. the cash shop â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t is just that: â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. paying for access to the premium shop, and then paying a subscription for your extra special guns really â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sucks and you should never, ever do it. always best to play with a group of people for missions, since good tactics and communication always beat shiny cash-shop â¥â¥â¥â¥. besides being able to have really intricate character customization, i really enjoy getting in my obnoxious van and following people around while playing stupid music. attempting to follow traffic laws is pretty fun, and a difficult challenge.
4646	0	a	this game is just â¥â¥â¥â¥in terrable , dont even try it i have got a really good gaming system , with 2560x1080 monitor powered by r9 270x 4 gig edition i can max out any game know to men , battlefield 4 i can happy max out among others , but on this game it stuttering like a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ the latency flatuates like â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ every few secs it just keeps on stuttering and i thought the game would be better after the update but no , its just run by â¥â¥â¥â¥in monkies they just push for pay to win to get players to us really money but the game is just â¥â¥â¥â¥in terrable poor optimised ,  i have done the vscript latecny fix , that does n't work , used task manager to close vivox voice service nothing â¥â¥â¥â¥in changes , lowed my setting to the lowest possible just nothing , it just keeps on stuttering wat the â¥â¥â¥â¥ ?????????????????  gamersfirst you are a disgrace you are the reason people lose hope in pc gaming its people like you who stops us from becaming the master race we were born to be   i want to hear what you have to say , send me an email on  axonmagnus@gmail.com   PROVE ME WRONG   'as always hope for the best but expect the worst'  axonMagnus
288	1	a	Its a great game. Except for the hackers. Get rid if the hackers completely, and it would be alot better.
8872	1	a	Over all a pretty good game , but FE has it's share of issues as I'll discuss below.    Story:   There isn't one. There is a bare bones backstory to the different factions, what they're about, and what they offer....but that's about it. There's also general story lines in each settlement along with a ton of sidequests, but they do little to establish any kind of narrative.    Gameplay:   FE works like a 3rd person shooter combined with WoW. You have to aim your own weapons (more on this in the PVP section) and there are a number of abilities you can activate during combat to give yourself an edge. This part of the game is done pretty well, combat is intuitive and if you pay attention to the tutorial, fairly easy to pick up.   The crafting system in this game is fantastic, almost every material needed to craft everything you could ever want can be salvaged from the world, harvested at player created farms, collected by player made harvesters in PVP zones, or purchaced off the Auction House.     Graphics:   This wasn't that big of a deal to me since I don't get hung up on graphics much, but this game was developed in 2009 and the graphics look pretty dated.     Player population:   I don't get alot of the complaints about this as at no point were any of the sector hubs empty. As a crafter I had no trouble making money off the Auction House as there were plenty of buyers for most of my products (once I figured out how to price them properly). You probably won't be tripping over other players when you're out in the middle of nowhere on missions, but is that a bad thing?    F2p or pay to win?   FE is good about this aspect as well. There is a cash shop where you can buy boosts to things like experience and faction point award rates; but there's no explicit thing you can buy in the cash store that will give you any advantage against an equally skilled and leveled player whom has never bought anything from the cash shop. The items you pay real money for are largely cosmetic or purely for convinence.     PVP:   This is by far the most mixed aspect of Fallen Earth. FE does reward pvp kills against different factions with a pvp currency, but in a move I haven't seen in any other MMO (except EVE), FE adds a reason to fight in PVP zones other than pvp currency, Harvesters. Harvesters are player created structures that generate crafting resources that hard to impossible to find outside PVP zones, and as you can guess can only be placed in PVP zones. When all goes well PVP is fun &amp; rewarding, regardless if your faction holds the conflict town at the end of the day.  So what's wrong you ask? First off you're not likely to get a real taste of PVP untill you're close to level cap, granted if you hang around the level 20-45 conflict towns you might bump into an enemy faction; but if you do it's likely to be a clan blob of 5-10 people leveling their alts &amp; steamrolling anyone in their path. The reason the lower level zones are so empty? The level debuff, which cripples anyone above a given conflict town's level range. The idea isn't a bad one: to keep tweaked out lvl 55s from curb stomping fledgling pvp players. But instead of bringing them on the level of people supposed to be in that zone it effectively renders the higher level player helpless; as a result nobody goes near conflict zones if there's even a chance they'll get hit with the level debuff.  But the absolute worst part is the proliferation of hackers (aimbotters and the like) in pvp. G1 does a pretty inconsistent job of keeping hackers in check; every once in a while they do a purge of hackers and PVP becomes fun again, but they always seem to come back. 90% percent of the challenge in pvp is consistently hitting your opponent, preferably with headshots which do considerably more damage, getting good at hitting and avoiding being hit is the core of PVP. So you can see how the fun gets quickly sucked out of this critical part of the game when you have ENTIRE CLANS able to sweep whole PVP zones simply by activating a 3rd party hack and racking up 100% accuracy while their opponents have no recourse what so ever. The fact G1 has been unable or unwilling to find a long term solution to this problem is by far FE's biggest problem.    Summary:   Fallen Earth is f2p game that isn't pay to win; that alone makes it worth a try. But digging deeper this game has plenty to offer in terms of PVE, crafting, and (if the hacker population is culled at the time) end game PVP. It's really up to what you value in an MMO if FE is worth your time; it certianly is for me despite it's faults.
1617	1	a	I'm confused, I can't get think is this a game, I thought more as a joke, even the years past playing it, i lost a lot of time, but really i did? But hey, this is really cute. I think it approaches as an astral mystical experience, and i don't think it's only me.  PS: This game will have a higher chance of get your brain f***ed hard, so, be aware.
1541	1	a	I've been unfairly matched against Max Ranks, Carbine'd directly into insanity, and glitched out of so many missions to the point I ask myself why I still pick up the mouse and try.  Favorite Game I have, GOTY 11/10 Would reccomend to friends and enemies alike.  EDIT: a year later and I still feel the exact same.
8373	0	a	I have about 500 hours on this game and I can say at the start it is really pay 2 win but later on the Weapons you are able to modify can be WAY better than the Premium Weapons.If you dont have money for GTA 5 and look for an alternative....Dont get this game it will cost more than GTA 5 later on but if you have friend definitly play this Game! Anyway a Dislike because of the Prices!!!
4074	0	a	Gotta love it when the game's first mission is to go up against people who have RPG's, sniper rifles, and LMGs.........just don't waste your time.
8433	0	a	it's quite fun but...   its kinda pay to win~
5687	0	a	One of the worst MMO's I have ever played!! Choppy servers, co-op is bad also. Alot of the Geeks that play will join your group only to shoot you in the back. Just bad with no sense of community .
6691	0	a	At first, I was like: Hey, this is pretty fun!  And then I was like:  I can't even start this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ unfuncional game without needing to restart my computer.  At least fix the damn game.
7373	0	a	this game always crash on me this game is suck â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
3875	0	a	Good potential, Bad company. ;) I rest my case
7774	0	a	I recommended this game it's all up to you Mr/Ms. steam User.Well although the time I spent in this game is not much but i can tell that this game is pretty much hard without paying with real life money.You have to get up and try to suceed with a tiny pistol and rifle and your policxe style Nissan Micra while other use muscle cars and vans with rocket launcher.It's hard to complete some achievements without paying plus you can't kill anyone that pay cash with your toy gun.
5357	0	a	downloaded game opened game game closed repeat 20 times uninstall game  PROS: the uninstall was quick and easy to use :)
4952	0	a	I have never said this about a single game I have ever played and im going to say it now. this game is cancer and needs to just be burned to the ground, servers and all. i have played this game for a good few days worth of time. if you are new plan on being trolled by everyone at all times. the community in the game is toxic and vomit inducing, this game is P2W so if you don't plan on paying money, plan on being the worst player on the server. the pay weapons have a demo version that makes them completely usless in every way. no joke you get to use a airsoft version of the gun for 30 minutes. (some how other players with the same weapon are able to 1 shot you a mile away like some kind of SMG sniper rifle) oh and im sure you are thinking 'oh ill just play for fun because its free!' well let me tell you right now that even if you do get into the game, the anti cheat system is bogus and broken. aim bots, clipping through walls, teleporting across the map, one shot kills from everyone but you. yes thats right this game is a broken pile and if i released this game i would be embarrassed, apparently this game just came out for xbox one and soon to the PS4, maybe it will be better on console but im not going to hold my breath. 2/10 for making a terrible GTA clone that only has 1/30th of the actual content.
8637	0	a	I wouldn't force Hitler to play this game.
4683	0	a	This game has a very interesting concept and could have easily been one of the best games out there, but that's not really the case since the whole game bases a lot around paying real life money to get a severe edge over your opponents unless they have also paid with their money, and if that is not the case. You will usually always be matched up against people that are at a much higher rating than yourself which makes it pretty unfair considering all the advantages they have.  This game is pretty much stupid and unbalanced right now, wouldn't really recommand this game before they have removed the 'P2W' aspect of the game.
1949	1	a	A good concept with poor execution worth it to check it out just to see what it could have been like.
4434	0	a	You know how when a horse breaks its leg, you're supposed to shoot it? Yeah, that was APB from the start. And then they tried to perform necromancy on it. But that didn't fix its broken leg. Now it's just rotting AND crippled.  Sure, you can dress your zombie horse up however you want. Give it a little hat. Try to pretend it's alive and well. But the truth remains; It's not. Every moment it exists is a plea to stop its unending torment.
10295	1	a	When starting the game: First impressions are this is a cheap game with no controlls, but after getting into the game after a good half hour and doing some major controll reconstuction in the settings this game is really fun! I just want to have waypoints for quests I havent put to much of my time into this game so far but is blowing me away.
7432	0	a	this games balancing is the worst of any ive ever played
2096	1	a	Really fun, if you decide to play, make a guy on Colby NA West and a criminal then msg me
6682	0	a	Please take this off steam
10388	0	a	THIS GAME SUCKS...I CANNOT LOG IN!!  THEN IM SO ANGRY ABOUT THIS
8974	0	a	1. Wait until game loads.  2. Wait until game loads all the endless updates.  3. Get in game.  4. Run around in tutorial and remove needed stuff by accident before trying to figure out how to get it back.  5. Meet partner in game, only one area available for joining so obviously go there.  6. Get in area, get attacked in first five seconds. Proceed to running around for a bit to explore after getting shot.  7. Realize there is nothing to explore and ride off to the sunset with Cletus just to never return.  Full points, would loot again.
3833	0	a	The only good thing about this game is the customization, which is grossly limited to free-to-play. That being said, the game play is ridiculously repetitive and unbalanced. Aimbot users are rampant with no ingame way to report offenders. The community is full of nothing but adolescent morons that makes âBarrens Chatâ seem like Shakespeare. I really wanted to get behind this game and even spend some money on it because it is a great concept, but after seeing that this game is just as bad (if not worse) as it was 2 years ago, I can tell that G1 is not serious about developing a decent game.
6565	0	a	wont let me play it because of an error
3145	1	a	Love the game! Just wished fairfight would do more work :D 
6163	0	a	Doesn't work. It keeps going into this update window but it never plays the actual game. Waste of time downloading this...
1611	1	a	Played it, died over 50 times. 9/11
9787	1	a	If you are one of those 100% completion types, this will keep you occupied for a very very long time. i have over 200 hours in this game, and i still haven't even left the first major area. and i still have quite a bit more to do yet before i will move on.    also good if you are a cheap â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ like me. all that time in, and i've spent no real money. i may not ever(sorry devs) because i can gather and craft anything i might need.   not for the impatient. some things can take a very long time(days) to craft, and only one at a time.
4486	0	a	the 1st prob is too much cheaters/hackers in the game! (that's the fact!) the 2nd prob is the shop's price is too much expensive like 50-60â¬ for 1 weapon or half price for haircut... and maybe idk some of the players are rich who knows? many of the players are full stuff with gold gear cars weapons... and the weapons are too much CHEAT the gold ones send u 10 bullets in 1sec (example) and the standard white gun in game is like you have a shotgun 80% damage in 1 shot and when u shot (all ammo off) those players under 5m they just kill you with handgun (gold weapon) like 2 shots without accuracy and keep running... the 3rd prob is technical i mean the game is unstable 'cause i'm playing on pc gamer and using fiber but have some trouble with the game stability or something... (i mean it's not perfect)  PS: i played over 300H so it's not just a beginners reaction!

5685	0	a	APB would be a recommend IF they 1) stopped premade gold(high threat good players) from making premade groups and farming new players on what is supposed to be a beginners server. They have ignored this issue and literally chased off 90% or more(no exaggeration) of their playerbase. Sort of the Obama of Developers, ignore the problem until it becomes so bad that they are forced to and then instead of taking action they say 'We are looking into it, bear with us a few years and we will probably do something about it' meanwhile it only gets worse.  2) Do even more about hackers. Fairfight was the first real step the developers took in combating Hackers, again only out of the exodus of players from the game because of it. They knew it was a problem in Beta and ignored it completely until 4 years later when combined with the problem I mentioned in the First point, the population is so sparse and they hardly make money.    The Good: 1) Customization is amazing. By far the most customizable game I have come across as far as looks, music and graphics. Simply put, Amazing.  2) WHEN you get a fight of somewhat even teams, it can be so much fun it is almost worth dealing with the 2 problems listed above. But even on Bronze server, which is where brand new players start, games which you will not face a premade group are maybe at best 50%. The premade groups you do fight against will be gold or highly experienced silver(they do tricks to lower their threat level so they can keep farming bronze for easy wins which I guess is fun to them) armed with rocket launchers, high level weapons modded out and grenade launchers.    TLDR: Unless they fix the bronze servers instead of just talking about it as well as improve their hack detection even more, stay away and do not reward the developers.
10815	1	a	I think that its pretty cool
3918	0	a	The only good thing this game has is its character customization the engine swap is not going to fix the fact that most of the weapons are balanced terribly, weapon and character modifications make no sence, the real stupid strafing back and forth while shooting being a liable tactic, the hit boxes being bigger than your character so when crouched behind a wall you are still able to get hit by enemy fire, the moving up and down behind cover and maintaining good accuracy while shooting, Being thrown of course while driving because someone that is not on your mission rammed you and flip you over and lastly the fact that some of the weapons that are secondarys should be a primary weapon. APB needs more then an engine swap it needs to be redesigned and re balanced in order for it to be a good game.
10282	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥

9860	1	a	Awesome mixture of rpg HUD + 3rd/first person shooting. WORTH
469	1	a	An enjoyable free-to-play game with a high level of customisation which can be rewarding at times. Have caution, however, as this game can be  highly  frustrating, and it's not without problems. To add to that, the devs seem to spend their time adding expensive paid content rather than fixing issues and bugs.   So, should you get it?  If you have some mates and are looking for a enjoyable casual gaming experience, then no. This game will make you rage! Download if you wanna get your competitive side on, but be prepared.
2016	1	a	This game is awesome fun to play can be easy and can be hard i reomend this game for 13+
1162	1	a	It's sad how pathetic this game is.
8246	0	a	I have put about 900 hours in this game. Now, after 2 years, I gave it another try. Absolutely nothing has changed. Couple of new contacts and that's it. Game still has a lot of cheaters, still p2w as ever, still terrible community etc...  First thing you see when you log in is Armas marketplace window popping up trying to shove all the expensive p2w stuff and cosmetics in your face. Absolutely ridiculous.  Still terrible matchmaking, gold disctricts are empty, the cars that were before exclusive for crims are now available to enforcers and vice versa (â¥â¥â¥â¥ing money grab much G1!?), still unbalanced weapons, still hitreg problems, still no new servers, nothing... The only thing that this game does is releasing new armas content so people can spend more money.  One thing I have to admit, it's one of those games that are very addictive. It's a fun game to play if you can ignore all the issues, so it's a shame devs are not interested to make something of this game. So, for everyone that has never played this game, don't do it. Trust me, save your sanity. The game is very hard to get into for newcomers and community is absolutely terrible. I have never seen anyone helping new players in this game, true talk.
4352	0	a	Now you can play as a SS Soldier and still be a good cop
3357	1	a	I'm Commisioner Gordon by day, and the Black Mask by night.  7/10  Would cruise in Police Car to 'In the Air toinght' By Phil Collins again.  Would not get kicked off team before xp gain for 3rd time though.
6954	0	a	Don't touch this game unless you have friends (AND U GUYS PRBLY DONT LOL). It's completely and utterly garbage without it. No but seriously, this game is an utter mess, it's good fun with your friends but otherwise you deal with a toxic community, a questionable company and so many hackers that the braindead community can't distinguish between the real ones and players that just play a lot.
10616	0	a	play this game, if you are as rich a taylor swift and can afford microtransactions ,to only lose all that money to lag and scammers. If you want to live longer uninstall and get a new steam account that doesnt have to game.
1803	1	a	Highly detailed character creator. Go to advanced and play around - possibilities are almost endless.  GTA-like gameplay, improved by competitiveness (your mission is opposed by members of the other faction). The pay for better items (which are ridiculously expensive with in-game currency) will leave you at teh mercy of others as a froob though (free playing noob).
2839	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ with this game, free to play, and cool
5665	0	a	Pay2Win + â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ gunplay= â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game Yeah, It's pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥. Just get GTA and get over it, Jeez.
9714	0	a	Worst game ever made, i'm sorry to say this but its just the truth
4688	0	a	Insanely grind or pay 2 win. Creators, you could make this game not free 2 play and remove that stupid premium â¥â¥â¥â¥ and etc.. because not its imposible to play.. rich â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ are just chilling with premium stuff, when poor people get â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ toxic and angry and everything, because they cant buy every gun they want for real money.
9725	0	a	WORST GAME EVER F2P more like p2w AND WORST GAME IVE EVER PLAYED â¥â¥â¥â¥ THE DEVELPOPEFLEKN. DO NOT PLAY THIS PEICE OF SH**!
6866	0	a	Haven't even had a chance to play because the registry is.... 'unusual' or for a better discriptive term, it's garbage. I've been waiting for over half an hour for my verification email and nothing has shown up so far. So before I even get a chance to play I already have my review made up for this, uh, game.. I mean I really can't complain much because I see a game that is free to play ES Online, and how garbage that turned out, but at least with this I didn't waste my cash on a $60 game only to not be able to sign in due to lack of servers. BUT that doesn't excuse the fact that I want to give this game APB a chance, but I'm very disheartened due to the fact I have yet to get a verification email. THUMBS DOWN!   I might make another review and change it later after my hair turns grey from waiting..,
791	1	a	10/10 my friend begged me to get it again.
4437	0	a	This game can not play anymore -_-
2174	1	a	Likes to randomly crash, but other than that it's a good game
2412	1	a	Alright, this is definitely going to be one of the more...odd reviews I'll have written, but APB is an odd game in the end. Here's how it goes: in the beginning, right when you start out, you'll be a trainee who knows nothing about the game except for what the tutorials show you how to do. And, more than likely, on your first mission, you'll be run over (both figuratively and probably literally) quite heavily. And, if you only get to play this game a little, with no connection to the forums or people to show you the ropes, you'll have a hard time actually getting good at the game.   The skill gradient in this game is intense and impossibly cruel, as you'll have to figure out things on your own all the while being trashed by your enemies, not to mention the learning curve. As with any game, there are some mechanics that you have to learn by doing, but in a game so diverse and deep as this (yes, it does have a definite deepness to it), there will be some mechanics that aren't overtly intuited by your gameplay, which makes the gameplay even more frustrating.   And, to speak of frustration, there will definitely be a lot of it. From the people using better guns, better strategies, better teamwork, and all around better gameplay, to your lack of knowledge of the game, there will be an intense amount of frustration on your end, mostly due to how -unfair- it all seems. Indeed, I know how it is. It took me up to rank 200 (out of a possible 255 ranks currently) to generally get good with about 75% of the game in total. And, on top of all that, you'll get the odd hacker here and there which will be upsetting for the people who're trying to play fairly, if only to add to the mess.  And yet, do I reccommend this game? I'm certainly wavering hesitantly over those two buttons down there, trying to decide if I -do- want more people to experience the game or if they should simply stay the hell away. It's really a tough choice, let me tell you.  After all, there are some redeeming parts to this game. The social aspect, if you get into it, can be enjoyable. The idiots in district chat are always there to be taunted if they get pissy about a game they lost, or if they're generally being stupid, and there are the charismatic teammates in the game that really make you enjoy a particular mission you're on. You could end up in a large clan where you get to play with a great amount of people with varied playstyles, or even make some good friends in the game and join their clan of a small, yet tightly knit, group.  To add to that, there's a large amount of variance in this game, meaning there's a huge number of guns and subsequent variations of from which to choose, along with cars and clothing, all of which can be customised to some extent. And, if you add to that the possibility of Premium accounts, then you add more slots for customisation. On top of even all that is ARMAS, which houses a plethora of guns that can only be attained fully by purchasing them, along with custom parts for some cars, and purchase-only clothing parts and gear. (That's the Pay2Win part of the game.) In reality, most of the ARMAS guns are there for the people who don't want to wait to unlock weapons in the game, or people who don't want to shell out in-game money every ten days for the guns they regularly use. Almost every weapon in the game is good enough and viable to play, as long as you match the gun to the situation it's prime in. Protip: don't be good or favour any one gun; try and be skillful with all of them.  In the end...I think I would reccommend this game to you. Yes, it lags. Yes, there are some hackers. Yes, it's difficult, and yes, the client crashes 10 percent of the time, but...I think it's something I want you to experience. It's something you can get addicted to easily, whether or not you enjoy it. All in all, I think it's a decent enough game.   So, give it a try. Put in about 500 hours worth of time, and then see if you want to quit it.   ~Kuro  -------------------------------- Tips: -Learn to tap-fire. Most guns are useless if you spray full-auto. -Starting gun 'Star556' is strong already if you know how to tap-fire. NTEC is also beastly; It's not called 'wintec' for nothing. -Make a max-height character to see the whole hitbox. All characters share the same hitbox size, so even if your body is fully behind cover as a small person, your hitbox might not be. -Play on bronze servers; Silver is full of highly-skilled players and hackers. -If you want Premium from ARMAS, don't buy only premium. Get a Joker box bundle. Chances are you'll get some nifty guns as well as premium codes in there. -Look up weapon guides, car guides, and code lists in the Steam 'help guides' that are available. They'll help to show you what's decent for which situation. -Gold servers are empty. No one goes there. You won't get opposition. Don't waste your time entering them.
384	1	a	Have you played GTA and like that sort of games? Then this is definitely something for you! Enforcers and criminals fight each other, choose your side, and play! - It's online :-)
4431	0	a	Got banned out of nowhere.... Contacted dev's got a bs copy and paste email.  Got with a real person. and they told me why I got banned. and that was it  they said I was hacking but when I asked what I was doing and what proof they had they ignored me.   Pros -  Awesome game   Cons - Pay2Play Random Bans from mods who dont like you.
513	1	a	One of the best Free OpenWorld Multiplayer games :)) There must be more games like this one..!!
6279	0	a	When you uninstall just right!
1111	1	a	Server is kinda shaky here and there but overall its a good game! *Important get a INTEL processor to run this game stresses a lot  on Processing power. Edit: 11/4/15 : Server performance is great getting 1ms latency.
5595	0	a	Games trash. Not worth any time, pay to win
6787	0	a	I played this on its first release and it really broke my heart when it went down for the first time. This was my game and I loved it!  Needless to say I was super excited when I heard that I was going to be revived. It really felt good in the first four to six weeks. I could live with having to rent guns instead of just buying them (ingame-$$$-wise). Then people got greedy and you couldnt even compete with your rented guns. Noobs were â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Golds with their freshly bought gold-guns. Thats when the game died a second time and my heart was shredd.   Didnt touch it for about two years, although I could barely hold me back every now and then... Today I couldnt resist and I jumped into the forums to get a quick glimpse of the game's state. Reading these comments saved my heart from being torn apart a third time. Thank you guys!   TLDR: Sob-story about an awesome game that has been killed by its developers, twice! 2 years of F2P just made it a lot worse.
1443	1	a	11/5 IGN-   This game, was probably the best game of 2089. For the first ten minutes, i had a nerdgasm over what you can do in APB, now that i realize, its more than a game, it's a deep meaning of symbolism. Looking at that black screen for a 19 minutes made me realize, that its not even worth downloading. Its so good, even steam wont exit out becuase APB is bullying Steam, and wont let it close out, ovevrall, 1492/420 - IGN.
4127	0	a	0/10 Server sucks engine suck gameplay suck everything sucks The freedom in character design is good though
2740	1	a	The gameplay and customizing in this game is incredible I have played since the beta and I will always love this game
7424	0	a	This may have differed now, but when I played this game, the landscape was a barren wasteland with nobody in it. (Not literally a wasteland) Also, it was hard as hell to find things to do but roam around. Half the time you would just be getting shot by other players and they are way better than you, so you can't do anything about it. It is also a GTA Clone. And by Barren I meant there were no NPC's you could ever find 2.3/10 -Wasn't Very Fun
5410	0	a	Unique game and playstyle, weapons are great, systems and everything about this game is amazing in it's own right, including the asylum and baylift, especially the clothes, vehicle, character, etc customization. Although many problems do exist with this game such as including the matchmaking system. One other problem although I know of this game is that steam registers it as open even when it has been fully closed for hours, unallowing you to close steam without the task manager. All in all though it is a great game besides some capatability bugs with steam. You got glitched galore in the maps and everywhere else. This game when you look for problems, you find them. You have kids with rocket launchers surfing card and firing away at you. Missions are onesided and heres the big one.....ANY â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ IN A GARBAGE TRUCK CAN RUN OVER YOUR CAR, CARS AROUND YOU AND EVERYTHIGN ELSE RAMMING IT AND DESTROYING IT ALL OUTSIDE OF ANY MISSION SO YOU CAN NOT HARD THEM TO DESTROY EVERYTHING.....and it's quite annoying I do say.... also you need 400+ hours in the game to even have a chance at taking on veteran players who log hours. combat is screwed up with hit registers due to when you shoot depends on when the server is pinging, everything having a small noticable delay

9280	0	a	The game is completely unplayable on a brand new laptop. It freezes, crashes,and if it does run, it does nothing but give the equivlent of what WoW would be on dial up, if that.
1258	1	a	Its APB enough said
6524	0	a	It's hard to call that playing as it kept shutting down. Buggy.
2966	1	a	a great game, lots of costumization, cars, guns, explosions, this game has everything... except jetpacks :(
3799	0	a	I know some of you are going to look at this and think, 2200 hours + and a negative recommendation, come on man, but please hear me out. I've been playing this game for a very long time now and have came to the ultimate conclusion that, yes, hackers rule all of APB, it 'IS' Pay 2 Win, and Gamers First will not do anything about it ever!  Now, here are the reasons:  1) Hackers are their primary source of income.  Need I say more?  Most of these guys that are hackers are little rich bleep nozzles who aren't good and instead of actually trying to get good, they buy hacks, and if I wasn't wiser, they're probably purchasing the hacks directly from the same people who run the freaking game.  I know this all sounds strange. But over the years I've played this, I've noticed so many hacks I didn't even know that many have existed. Walls, Aimbot, Lag Hacks, you name it, its in APB or has been.  And whats even funnier, oh ya'll are gonna love this.... The hacks seem to change out every couple of months or so. Its like they're on a subscription plan to hack! I have little doubt of that.  Now, if you throw money at this game, it helps you out dramatically. I use to think that, well, you can get these guns in the game with in game currency if you just play for long enough, but no... no, no, no, nooooo, this is not true. For example, you can buy an OCA with in game currency, however, if you use money to purchase an OCA Whisper, well, its about 3x better of a weapon from what I've experienced when using it.  I know some of you hackers, trolls, and others are going to downvote this, but w/e, it is what it is.  There are some things that make this game good, dont get me wrong. I think when it was first developed they had 'some' good intentions. I'm not sure how far those good intentions go however.  The good things about APB are, the customizations in the game are 2nd to none. Highly customize your car, your body, your clothes, even create songs and themes.  Another good thing is all the events that they hold. I really like that and I wish other games would do it more often. For example, they have a Halloween event, xmas event, and lots of others all throughout the year. Also they do special events. For instance, they just had an event where if you get so many kills a day, you unlock 20 Joker Mystery Boxes. It was cool.  Now, this is where the good things stop.  Ok, so one thing about the Joker Mystery Boxes, they hold special permenant weapons that you can unlock, however there is a slim chance of getting one. Actually, a way way way way way too slim of a chance of getting one. I unlocked 60 Joker Mystery Boxes and didnt get 1 permenant weapon. 60!  I feel bad for people who spend money on this game that dont hack honestly.  I feel bad for people who spend money on this game period. At least until Gamers First does something about the horrible hacking community they have in APB. Which, from the looks of things, they're never going to do anything about. Because like I said, refer to point 1) in the beginning of this review.  It all makes sense. They say, oh we implemented Fair Fight and that will take care of the hackers in APB. Yeah, well, Fair Fight only gets rid of the blatent hackers, the ones that skip all over the map... shoot a lot faster.... and get 30 kills and 0 deaths contantly. Problem is, theres so many more hackers that go undetected by Fair Fight, and most never get caught. And I'm guessing for good reasons too.  I really have had some good times in APB, but there's been way more bad times than good I can say. Mainly fighting the hackers. I just got out of APB and every match was against hackers, I mean come on, all I want is a decent match without hackers, is that so much to ask for?  One more thing, this game has lagging unlike any other. I'm not sure why, or how its possible that this is the 'ONLY GAME' that lags like this, but its really annoying. I sort of feel like the hacks have a big part to do with it honestly. I think the hacks are actually coded into the software itself and it compensates for them through lag to make up for the time.  Anyways.  If you're new, welcome to Hackworld. If you don't hack, I wouldn't even waste your time like I have unfortunately :(  Also, as a side note, the APB community is the absolute worst community I've ever experienced in the history of gaming. Absolute Worst!  All the legit players that I know wish and hope that this game will come around and that the hackers will be all gone and dealt with one day, but honestly, I just dont see that happening. They've made their choice. And instead of fixing that, they shove out more things for people to buy on the marketplace. Its disgusting really.  If they would just get rid of the hackers, this game could really shine and be a legitimately fun game that thousands of people would spend hours enjoying with their friends.  I'll continue to play this game until I get all the achievements, which isn't far from now, and also my criminal to 255, which is not far off. But after this, I won't be seeing much of this game anymore until Gamers First decides to actually do something about their disgusting community of hackers, trolls and the sorts.  If you'd like a list of  Games You Absolutely Must Have , check out our group here on Steam and we'll be happy to show you some alternatives to this mess.
10171	0	a	Not very good. Even for free. Not worth the time.
4954	0	a	I can honestly say I miss this game for the game play and customization, but that's it. I don't miss G1's horrible service or the rampant hacking OR the horrible people playing the game. Sigh... What a waste.
10347	1	a	dont forget your password or create mutiple accounts it wont be pretty but the gameplay is good 
4604	0	a	i was a noob once, then i bought the keys to the city and never lost a mission ever again its extremely hard to play as a new player and by new i mean anything below max level i just play it for the character customization, thats pretty well done in this game this is now a dress up game for me though thats only if i can get the game to work correctly  let me refer-a-friend you and will carry the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of you
2280	1	a	Loved this before and after f2p great game with friends
7204	0	a	This game is fun but meh. It's aggravating and the community is TOXIC AF. DO NOT GET IT IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A NICE FREE-TO-PLAY GAME THAT HAS A GOOD COMMUNITY. SAVE YOUR GORRAM MONEY!!!
6607	0	a	Havent even play the game yet and theres already an error -_-
4125	0	a	This game is so broken it doesn't even let me go throug the login screen.
5504	0	a	cant even play when its starting it just freezes and i have to restart my computer samething when i got it from the website if fixed i will try again for now dont download
5103	0	a	game dosen't even launch, had brief moment where it did work and it was ok but then stoped working again. can not recommend
3860	0	a	I played APB Reloaded when it was in beta, it was a great game and had some cool concepts for both Enforcers and Criminals. Then ARMAS shop was open and it all went to trash, 'Gamersfirst' nerfed the witnessing system to oblivion so its no longer viable for enforcers. Noobs that spend 10$ or more can wreck veterans that have 2000+ in game hours, even if you're silver and supposed to get paired with silvers and bronzes, you'll most probably be paired with rank 255 golds with ARMAS. Just dont play it, its not worth the time nor the effort, it was a good game, yet P2W components â¥â¥â¥â¥ed it up totally.   In the other hand, the game concept is fun, yet as I said you're not going anywhere without using cash or at least spending 3000hrs or more.  EDIT: Forgot to say, dont play it please and if you already do, dont spend money on it unless you really like the game, dont give this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ devs any more money, they dont deserve it.
8063	0	a	this game sucks!
632	1	a	1/10 Would not load again.
5177	0	a	I've been on and off this game for about 2 years. To me the game overall is a decent idea and the customization is the best i've seen compared to any other game. The things I didn't enjoy about this game is the matchmaking. Dispite what happened in the past with the flood of aim bots and hackers; The match making is also broken.   Why is it that a gold player can just decide to join a bronze server and womp on all the new players and get just as much money as they would in a gold server? THEY SHOULD BE AUTO KICKED, Threat levels should mean something, not just a color where they recommend you go.   fix this, or your game will crumble.
4708	0	a	I wish I had read the reviews before I actually went into the game a few years back. For the most part, you need a high end desktop to run this. I had found the concept interesting, but now it just runs rampant. The customization is really nice. However, this is NOT new user friendly (I'm an average player). I had no clue what I was doing. Everything seem expensive and confusing.

1792	1	a	Alright as far as i see APB Reloaded its a really fun game...the only thing I think everyone who wants to play this game should know before they join is that there is going to be a lot of haters and people who get mad easily, all I suggest for this really is to ignore them and continue on playing because games are meant to be fun not stress alright...that's just my opinion. :3

1799	1	a	This game is great. You can have a criminal character or an enforcer character, and engage in PvP combat with other players by starting missions within the game. It is PvP based however, so if you aren't into PvP, I wouldn't recommend this game for you, for there are no bots to kill aside from the civilians. There are open-world crimes that criminals can commit and enforcers can witness, or there are official missions with objectives, which yield higher rewards and almost always throw you into a PvP situation, unless you happen to be one of the only people in the district. Some open-world crimes you can commit as a criminal are mugging and ram-raiding. Overall this is a great game for people looking for a Grand Theft Auto type of game for free, though this isn't too much like Grand Theft Auto, honestly.

5417	0	a	BAD game  bad graphice  i hope any one can see any thing true in this game
784	1	a	Great and fun Open World game
8926	0	a	outdated look, uninteresting combat, dialog sounds like its from the 90s. you are better off just playing fallout with mods.
10231	1	a	Really good game its just like fallout only set online
2354	1	a	One of the best 3rd person shooters I've ever played, lots of fun in a massive city!
4384	0	a	Very laggy, specially when i drive with a car... Should fix lag then i will press like.
7898	0	a	It is a pain to download!
5689	0	a	This game fails on the most basic of level: being entertaining.
7739	0	a	This game is really a piece of trash. I was expecting something like Grand Theft Auto Online, but this is something totally different - it's boring, it's weird, like when someone tries to make Saint's Row, but boring Saint's Row, without the giant â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and stuff. And MMO, of course. And one does not simply create a game like this. Don't download it, you'll be uninstalling it in a few hours, maybe minutes... perhaps seconds.  Overall: 0/10
3659	1	a	Played it for a bit. Awesome once you play it for a while but throughout you'll always meet p2w players with better gear.
687	1	a	fun recomend good graphics card though
5514	0	a	There was a time when APB was good. Until they let cheaters to do their dirty work. now its APB-ReCheaterLoad
6081	0	a	So good it wont even launch great game really.... i installed it in steam and it says it did not installed properly
8611	0	a	IT NEVER LOADED..................................
2552	1	a	If like GTA, honour first creator, play APB. Plutarks be pleased.
10044	1	a	Buggy as hell, AI is utterly â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, don't expect any patches. Only real reason to play this game is for its uniqueness: An MMORPG with Third-person shooter mechanics, and a decent salvage based crafting system.
2251	1	a	good game its just a bit laggy during intense moments for me but ive heard that a ssd fixes that problem (i have a hdd). but apart from this problem its agood game.
174	1	a	I would recommend this game as a FREE Wonnabie GTA Cops vs Robbers.  I must warn you though, this game like most MMO's has a lot of bugs, the most common of these is the 'General Protection Fault.  Other than that it is a Decent FREE game and it does have access to Premium Content if you desire it, such as exclusive vehicles etc.
6698	0	a	APB has a really good concept for a free2play game, but in my opinion it's more pay2win than anything else. If it goes the route that Path of Exile does it microtransactions, I'll gladly return. I shouldn't have to be forced to buy a weapon or anything that gives me gameplay advantages. I want to like APB, but it's the pay2win elements that is turning me off completely from the game.
10668	1	a	A fun little MMO with its own bitz of fun! It's a fast-paced, bullet hell, bit game with some pretty decent tracks. Honestly the game did a great job for what it is. It may have a few problems and there is room for improvement. Really you should just hop on if you want a quick and free bullet hell, but also invite your friends. Other than that Great game overall.  8.4/11 -Dj Shady
10765	1	a	This game is a highly addictive, fast paced MMORPG with tons of items, features and capabilities. With an intense difficulty level and never-ending combat(Of course you can go take a break, but in order to progress, you HAVE to fight), this game is easily one of the best MMORPGs on the Steam Marketplace. You can play with dozens of friends and team up to kill major bosses. And to top it all off, it's free! If you're into fast-paced MMORPGs where you can team up with friends and go through countless battles, this is the game for you.
937	1	a	i really like this game but the controles are wierd and the the graphics has false advertise
3193	1	a	Heavily reliant on your RAM. Synchronization is server-based rather than client based, so when you press W it takes an extra half second for you to move forward. Once you get used to the slight lag, it's a wicked good game dude.
7338	0	a	the only game i uninstalled within 1 day
8833	0	a	it was crap because in the costomise player i couldnt accept to next stage because it filled my monitor right up and couldnt change it in game because i couldnt pass the stage so would be good i could pass it aye
3234	1	a	Despite the AWFUL AWFUL start out and cruelty towards newbies, but once you force yourself through a veritable HELL in the game it eventually calls to you in a way that says 'play me some more, play me some more, you will like it once you play it long enough' which seems to be the case for me, but the lag spikes are kinda irritating and if you have a really under performing NON-gaming computer, you'll have a HELL of a time trying to play this game!
2041	1	a	It's good.
10798	1	a	the best game ever
10504	0	a	Alright. This game. I used to play it on its website, but I downloaded it on here to review it.  Realm of the Mad God used to be one of the games I played the most. However, when the company Kabam bought it, it instantly became a store. Kabam are just greedy, money grabbing rip-offs, and they are the exact reason I have stopped playing this game. The main lobby is just a store, showing off weapons, armor, pets, and other things that can only be bought with coins, which can be bought with real money, or can be earned from dieing with a decent to good character who needs good stats to actually earn the coins. Feel free to play this game, but prepare your â¥â¥â¥â¥ for micro-transactions and updates that only benifit people who love to spend money.
4899	0	a	Nah m8. Memories of the game consits of horrid ping (I'm in Australia, so obviously so) BUT every other game I play, where I play in an American server, does not give me a 1 - 2 second delay from when I press a key to when I move in the game. APB Reloaded is the only game to do this. That isn't even the worst part. Horrible P2W, so much scripting and hacking and a horrible community. My biggest memory of this game was when I was in a mission and my team was so close to winning but a person outside the mission drove and parked a van right over the checkpoint we needed and continued to sit in the van and wait there until our timer ran out, once it did, he drove off. There was nothing we could do about it.
1115	1	a	The launcher crashes before it even begins. 9/11 Would relaunch again.
9292	0	a	Don't.
2550	1	a	Very nice game!It is so fun if u have some friends!It's not pay2win because Star556( free gun u get it at start) it's op if you know how to use it! 
3763	0	a	The Good, The Bad, The Ugly  |Review|   The good:   If you love playing cops 'n robbers in various areas of a city, crashing into shops and stealing loot or arresting criminals and returning the stolen goods this game is for you. On top of that you have a VERY detailed customization system that will keep you occupied as well as composing music when you die to making detailed symbols and pictures. A decent ammount of guns and equipment sets give you various different styles of gameplay and approaches to certain missions. If you want to take a break from the chaos of the city and just want to shoot people they have TDM maps where you can frag at your leisure. As one of my most played games in my library I found much enjoyment in this game and even though I go on hiatus from time to time I will find myself crawling back eventually.    The BAD:   Its really a shame that Real time worlds (the original creators of the game) went bankrupt because they rushed a game that could of been something so much greater than what it is now. Even though it was brought back to life and handed over to some free to play company no one has ever heard of I was still glad it was given a second chance. From the start I had high hopes that GamersFrist would give this game some dignity and held that vision that some of the core developers of this game had. However even for as long as they have had the game you can't notice much change in the game itself. Yes they have events but its just mission events that really don't mean anything, its just regular missions painted in what ever holiday it happens to be. Also there used to be a good rapport between the GF and the gaming community. Maybe that has changed but since then but I left when we didn't hear a world from our devs and were swimming in problems...   The FRIGGIN' UGLY:  Of course free to play comes at a cost. How are they going to fund this game and create more content for the players and make this game better? Microtransactions. A concept on paper that really (at least in my opinion) seems harmless. But when a company MAINLY focuses on the content for thier in game shop you begin to see the true colors of what thier intent is. With little to almost nonexistant game updates, content and almost some new item every week in the in game store you can notice that either...   A) someone is having money trouble B) Cash cow circle jerk  This game to me was a work of art and gave me so much fun and enjoyment that I wish thier marketing schemes didn't get to me. If you think i'm â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ting you just look at thier facebook account. THERE IS BARLEY ANY OTHER POSTS OTHER THAN ADVERTISEMENTS FOR THIER SHOP ITEMS. Zero â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t go look... All this makes the player not want to even log in... Its that obnoxious. But I get it, you got to make some money. But how about make the game more enjoyable, make the gamers keep coming back and of course they'll buy something. Don't pray on the very few people in your community that spends hundreds of dollars on in game items.   THIS. IS. WHAT. MAKES. YOU. SO. DAMN. UNATTRACTIVE.  This was a major issue for me but other uglies include.  -low pop -meh ranking system -has been almost the same since beta.   Take it or leave it folks. Thumbs down but take a peak anyways. You might not care about the advert spam. Maybe its changed.
10505	0	a	i love this game, i used to play it when my other game is updatig, it was fun  until Kabam ruined it
947	1	a	Community is Terrible. Gameplay servers use dial up. 0/10
2252	1	a	i just got the game and its gr8 and its almost like gta just to tell yeah and its fun
313	1	a	Well, the game pretty good it's been updated a lot. But my friend lost about $300 on the game. And it's pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥ when trading..
5483	0	a	piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ that you should never touch unless you want to contract aids
5865	0	a	This game honestly seems unplayable to me. I'm sure its a good game, but I can't see for myself because when I go to register theres a little sign/symbol thing in front of what I think is the next step button. I can't even get past the first step because of this. Theres no guides or oher people having this problem. I can't scroll, I can't move the box, just completely stuck. 0/10.
951	1	a	after 28h of playing i can recomend the game to everyone.It may not have the best physics o graphics but i dont know bout the others buti found the community very good.You can pretty much ask anywhere for help and when you first log into the game you'll be welcome from everyone and the tutorial is very effective too.The game concept is good the side missions are fun the optimization might not be perfect but it is good enough for low-end machines.Customization is amazingly awesome.To sum up this game is a gta v but free and with worse graphics and physics
12	1	a	While this game does have its up and downs, probably the best part of this game is the customisation that can be achieved with the ingame editors, from recreating a certain song into a 5 second theme to making anime in the symbol editor. While the user generated content is amazing, the game does have a lot of downsides.  First off lets go with the matchmaking system, first off, districts are broken down into threat levels, green being worst and gold being the best. The main issue with this is that the matchmaking is based on the threat level and doesn't take your rep level into consideration, which is actually the level you need to increase to be able to unlock and access better gear so in many cases during my playtime, I being a low leveled player have faced the hell fury of 200 plus repped golds using osmaw's and grenade launchers on people who are still fairly new to the game.  Another issue is certain cash shop guns, while none of them are that dramatically overpowered to be considered litterally pay2win (Like there's no sniper rifle that can kill someone at full health in one shot). Most of them will give an advantage over other players, such as a joker cr5 thats moddable from when you start playing to buying pre-made guns such as a whisper, although the beginning weapon known as a STAR by the community, was actually buffed or tweaked to make it not so useless.  Now lets move on to bugs, like most f2p titles, a lot of bugs don't really get fixed until way later on in time, there are a few exploits in this game that allow players to get certain objectives stuck behind walls (This is common with capture the flag objectives) to players attempting to get out of the map (Mainly only in fight club). While those are exploits that players could abuse if they discovered them. There are also some bugs that will screw over your play experiance, such as random disconnects and crashes.  I also do not recommend playing APB if you have less than 8GB RAM on your computer, this game loves to eat up memory, my guess is that APB reloaded loves to store texture memory within the RAM in order to allow fast loading, to be honest I doubt i'm right, but its my only guess as to why it'd hog up so much resources.  And next off is the servers, laggy and litterally unstable, from horrible lag spikes when a district is full to litterally dropping client connections for no bloody reason what so ever, which is the main reason preventing me from playing the game propperly. Ontop of that is the slow and small patches applied to the game each week, while its good to finally see the game getting updates that were needed 6 months ago, this new movement by the devs to switch the games engine to a newer version of unreal 3 feels too late as the playerbase continues to decrease in size.  But I also forgot, punkpuster is litterally the worst anti-hack program I have ever seen, its just as bad as all those third-party or first-party anti-cheat rootkits most other MMOs force install onto your computer, it litterally doesn't do anything to stop hackers, the game has some pretty known active cheaters roaming around. Although personally imo, any anti-cheat tool that waits before banning doesn't work with any F2P title since these guys can just make new accounts every single time.  Overall I feel APB reloaded does have the capability to be something amazing, I am willing to support the game aslong as the improvements continue, I just wish it was more than just 1 ltitle fix or one tweak every week, I also wish the servers wouldn't dc me constantly and I also wish new clothes packs didn't cost 40-50 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dollars.
2266	1	a	Really good and fair game. Without G1C you can do fine(Still be one of top).Report system work. G1C system is good as well because developers need and deserve money(So if you want to be fancy-donate). You can get almost anything for free with game money. Only problem are botters&amp;afk ppl.... they are all over FC:BS and silver districs.

3440	1	a	I would say it is a pretty solid game, it's just that the Pay to Win is a bit too obvious but with the majority being f2p I think it is not a big problem.
6103	0	a	i really don't like this game
9144	1	a	Amazing apocalyptic world based on MMORPG system which has Quests, Towns, Missions, Vehicles, Pets, Crafting, Looting, Many skills such as constructions, biology, geology, armorcraft, ballistics and so much more!
5797	0	a	I dont feel like this game should be on steam free2play list, it should be on pay2win. So the only thing good is the Character customization, I spent 1 hour because there are too many selections. The bad thing is the optimization and the players....they hack eyy.  Im giving this a 6/10 :(
1350	1	a	Awesome game, but a bit laggy.
5150	0	a	  Kat plays it so it bad, it hurt brain celss and iz full of hackerz
10905	1	a	I love this game. However, it definitely falls into the love it or hate it category. It is accurate to describe it as a bullet hell RPG. Some people can't get past the art style alone, but again that's something I love about it. There are 14 character classes, which gives quite a bit of variety. You can play the game absolutely free, but you can also support the game and go the easy way by doing micro transactions within the game itself for items or customization. Part of this game is dying, especially by being a little too greedy or picking a bad teleport to some random person on the map. However, the max character level is 20 and it is easy to get back up there from level 1 in an hour. There are different levels of items and each class has its own special ability item as well. There are also pets that you can find or buy to give you in game bonuses. I don't like all the changes they've made since I first started playing it, but I still love the game. It's a rare game that you can have a lot of fun with by yourself or with a group of friends or even with random strangers.
3151	1	a	Well this game is great things that are premium are just about the same as the ones you can buy through earning my biggest problem is that all the cars in this game even the premium ones are so hard to drive and in a mission some times get paired up with pros and guys who pay to win which is unfair.
9612	1	a	This game is actually a very well-made game, The people who recently gave review to this game either has a horrible  PC or just can't stand a single second for minor bugs.  I've played this 2-3 years back and it was super fun. It may not have much players now, But its still the fun game i know and love,  I managed to make Soap Mactavish come to life in this game. Couldn't remember the username and password.. it was like 2-3 years ago, Can't blame me.  Either way, Its still a good game. It takes a special person to enjoy this wonderful piece of work. Everyone who disliked this most probably isn't a special kind and just throws in a bad review to make it look bad. Don't worry, This game will be revived sooner or later filled with players,   i'll come back here one day with a ton of players joining me. It only takes a few players to make this game big again, So i ask you.. are you up for the challenge?
1356	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME

10661	0	a	To be honest if there was an option of recomending it and not, i would choose that. I mean this game is just that to me, 50/50. See, let me start off by saying i played this on Kong back in October of 2011, loved it. A few laggy moments but that was because of an overloaded server (which is very unlikely to happen). Than summer of 2012 came. And oh boy, did it start to change. I have been noticing the monoplizing of the market place, everything was very steeply priced, and i couldn't afford it. So i played as a noob for about a year or so. Left ROTMG, left Kong. And came to steam. And then i found ROTMG, i was exstatic. It was very nostalgic for me. But then i noticed the market, it got HUGE, little portals to smaller markets, eggs, food, and dungeon keys, it was very surreal. And then i finally gave in, and bought some vaults (because i started getting good and had little to no area to put my loot). Big mistake, that was when Kabam milked my steam wallet dry. I mean it was my decision, but my back was against the wall, the game that i loved back then, or other games. And that is why i don't recomend ROTMG, it started out play to win, now its just pay to win. 4.5/10
10396	0	a	Horrible game. The interface is clumsy and unintuative, even with customization. The graphics are sub-par, and hardly anything in the game can be interacted with, even though there are what appear to be useful items strewn about. Don't waste your time with this one.

4867	0	a	I had a very sorrowful experience with this game a couple years ago. Filled with cheaters and negligent staff. I felt like leaving a review, because I had spent thousands of hours playing and upwards of $500 in the game. The company managing this game (Gamersfirst) is incredibly horrid and I would not recommend playing this game to anyone. Wish I could have avoided it.
9001	1	a	This game is amazing. I headed into it completely blind, and i was astounded as to the sheer enormity of it. Every session i play i find a new item or enemy. The game world is so big I havent been out of the first sector yet and im still surprised to the hugeness of it. Plus you get all of this for free.  I love the skill advancement, its non-linear and your are free to spec into anything you want. There are no classes to restrict you, telling you how to play the game. The only classes are the ones you make yourself.
8133	0	a	Worst game ever unless you got a big wallet! DONT PLAY IT!
10154	1	a	Fallen Earth. This game could be so much more than it is, and it is a lot. It is sad that development has fallen to a snail's pace. This game features one of the best crafting systems in an MMO, where almost everything has to be crafted and can be crafted by you. Since it has gone F2P, it has not been relegated to a P2W game, just P4C.
2545	1	a	It's a bit frustrating at times, but over all alot of fun, and with a nice set of customizable options too! :D
2095	1	a	Fun game, but criminals have too much nice stuff ;(
824	1	a	Has its querks, but worth playing, even just on and off.
7256	0	a	I have about 500 hours on this game and I can say at the start it is really pay 2 win but later on the Weapons you are able to modify can be WAY better than the Premium Weapons.If you dont have money for GTA 5 and look for an alternative....Dont get this game it will cost more than GTA 5 later on but if you have friend definitly play this Game! Anyway a Dislike because of the Prices!!!
3821	0	a	APB is a very...complicated game. Do you want to become a criminal, and just go to town on a city full of innocent people with riches worth taking, and start massive riots against the police and government? Do you want to be a peacekeeper, and maintain order in a broken city by breaking criminal operations and protecting the innocent? Then what the F*** are you doing playing APB Reloaded? This game is NONE of what it looks like on the surface. After putting more hours than I'm ever thought I would, I can say I can make a worthwhile review.  Let's weigh the Pro's and the Con's  Pro's:  *The game, for a free-to-play, is very good looking. The graphics as far as shadowing and detail goes are top-notch.  *The Character Customization is outstanding. You can literally make whatever you want, within reason. But this can also lead to some bad stuff. See Con's for more info.  *The game has regular seasonal events for Easter, Halloween and Christmas. These game modes, sans Easter, are mainly in the Arena 'Fight Club' mode where certain things have been changed to fit the season. The Christmas one is especially good.  *The game has a very large variety of guns, but more can be said about this in the Con's.  *The game does offer variety to activities depending on the faction that you choose. Criminals can do different things than Enforcers and vice-versa  *There are several instances to play in, so you never really feel left out.   Con's:  *The game is a powerhouse to run. Most PC's won't even be able to handle it, and the 'low' settings don't really help. Most people have to use community made mods to lower the settings down even further than the game allows just to play it. That isn't entirely something that's in GamersFirst's control, but the idea that an outside party mod has to be active for some people to even play is a bit offputting.  *The game has seriously unstable connection problems. Countlessly, you will be lagged out of districts, and while you're in the server, you will be bouncing all over the place trying to get a grip on where you're going, only to shoot back several rooms because the server couldn't keep up. This is a glaring issue, and only exacerbates other problems.  *One such problem includes actually landing shots on enemies. This game has some of the most inconsistant damage I've ever seen in a game, and the shot registration is abysmal. You will find yourself losing gunfight after gunfight simply because the other person is better connected to the server than you, or his gun suddenly does more damage than before. Sometimes, your gun will kill someone in 4 shots, and the next person you shoot takes 9-10 shots to put down. This whole game can be summed up as 'Inconsistant.' That's the bottomline.  *Just because there's a lot of guns, doesn't mean they're all different. There are a lot of guns that function exactly like other guns. The Joker Carbine acts just like the STAC-10. The NTEC acts just like the AR-15. This doesn't even touch on the Snipers. Quite literally, the guns are recycled and released to the public for actual money, where they act just like the last gun they sold. This one just looks different.  *There is a large pay-to-win gap in this game. Most guns can be earned in-game, and some guns can even be made permanent. However, most of the time, you'll be renting leased weapons, and these will only last up to 7 days. Some guns you have to actually pay to make them permanent. This is also an issue in the 'Premium' system, where if you pay for a set amount of time, you gain more money and experience toward your standing. While this isn't too bad and is nowhere near as bad as some other games doing this, it's still a bit unfair to the people just getting into the game.  *The game is very confusing at first, and there is no good tutorial. The way it works is, when you start, you have to gain up reputation with certain people to gain rewards, raise your standing with them to get more rewards, and to increase your threat. The higher your win/loss ratio in missions is, the better your threat is. The three primary tiers are Bronze, Silver, and Gold. There are also ranks within that. Nowhere in the game is this explained to you, or at least explained well. You will have no idea what you're doing for a long while.  *The game has horribly unbalanced matchmaking. More often than not, you will be pitted against people who are far better armed, skilled and familiar with the map than you are, and you will be shut down again and again, because the game will refuse to give you people around your level. Your reputation, Threat, or overall level does not affect who you will get matched up against. I have seen Bronze players go up against Gold players and get utterly annihilated. This kind of thing is far from fair.  *The game has one of the absolute worst communities I have ever seen on a MMO, no, a GAME before. The people on this game range from little kids screaming about how bad you are in the chatbox, to grown men whining and complaining about weapons and tactics you're using. And GOD HELP YOU if you're a Bronze or a Silver on this game. To be a Gold, is to be the scum of the earth in most cases. Golds constantly and consistantly berate Silvers and Bronzes for the most mundane of reasons, and will go out of their way to make your time on this game as unpleasant as possible. Very few people will actually answer any questions you have about the game while playing, and are more likely to make fun of you for not knowing than just telling you. This Con is the most deciding of why this game just isn't worth the time.  *Because of the community being as disgusting as it is, this brings up a very big issue in the Character Customization. With the massive scale in which you have control over your character, comes every negative you can think of to compromise it. You will constantly see fat black men with giant, often neon colored, afros in limited to almost no clothing at all running around, or you may even see Adolf Hitler running around. This is also a problem with the fact that the naming system for your characters is unrestricted, so racial and offensive names are abundant. For every good costumed character running around, there's a 'TyroneFriedChicken' to muck it all up.  *While the game likes to parade the idea of 'FairFight' around like it's some form of trophy, the game is still overrun with hackers. With constant new hacking tools emerging every time another is addressed, you'll constantly see this as an issue. And while the response time to have them removed permanently from the game is rather quick(Most of the time), it's still the fact that they're there in the first place that makes this a problem.   In closing, APB Reloaded is an ex-pay to play MMO shooter with subpar action and goofy as hell ragdoll physics. But it's a dying game, and with the community punching more and more holes in the sinking boat that is this game, and further alienating and shunning new players, it will eventually sink completely. I can not recommend this game to anyone with the condition that it's in. All the FairFight updates in the world can't save this game if the community won't help to keep it afloat.
5205	0	a	I interest for this game charactermaker:),but this game is pay to win:(
2957	1	a	The game is fun
9789	0	a	THE WORST MMO I'VE EVERY PLAYED! I wanted to kill myself like the samurai did in japan....... 80 minutes I'll never get back D:
3321	1	a	its ok
6930	0	a	dont even bother, the devs are milking this game for every micro transaction its worth and then some.
6657	0	a	I've been on this â¥â¥â¥â¥ train long enough to see that nothing changed since my last visit. The matchmaking still â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sucks cosmic balls, it doesn't matter what rank you're at be it 10 20 120 if you just started you gonna have your self a real â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Getting in to missions against players like ranks 255 with ARMAS guns while you out there are buttâ¥â¥â¥â¥ing naked â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of luck and jolly well â¥â¥â¥â¥ed. Unless you want to spend like 500$ at this game forget about having fun.  So yeah here's just a little rant about the stupid â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ balls to the wall matchmaking they have in this game. It doesn't matter what rank you are how good you are the game it pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥ing simple - bronze - silver - gold - that's it that's literally â¥â¥â¥â¥ing it, those 3 'Threat' levels - and it doesn't even care about anything else as long there are players on those channels. So prepare your self for 95% of the times for the best â¥â¥â¥â¥ grinding frustration of your life as you will be totally obliterated by the oposite team. FUN! Right? It all can be fixed by adding a proper functional skill system, locking the channels by ranks, making channels that deny use of ARMAS stuff, but the current owners and devs just don't give a â¥â¥â¥â¥. I mean, while the money keeps rolling why fix it if it ain't broke, right?  To be honest this game has been for years around and really nothing has changed, no new districts, even fewer channels now, less people playing the game, the only new weapons and other stuff are behind a paywall. It had potential but they â¥â¥â¥â¥ed it up.  Giving this game a rating would be like selling your soul to the devil.
1835	1	a	highley recommended even though my pc sucks at 1.9 GHz and a 256 MB graphics card i can still play with tons of lag and i love the game but please make a patch so it dont lag for me no more it gets annoying!
9495	1	a	i think its perety col its awsome some peps should come try it out 
7897	0	a	Ok... APB Reloaded is a peculiar game. It's fun and completely awful all at the same time. The most controversial aspect of this game is it's usage of the Free-to-play model, a significant change from it's original incarnation as a subscription based game. However, this model always begs the question: Do you actually have to pay money to play this game against other paying players? In this case, the answer is unfortunately a resounding 'Yes!!!' Using in-game money received from beating missions (which I have significant issues, as you'll read momentarily) only unlocks weapons for 10 days. Additionally, not all weapon types are available for purchase using the in-game money. Some of the most powerful weapons in the game (the OCA 'Whisper,' for example) are only available for purchase using G1 credits -- otherwise known as real money. This type of F2P model is horribly unattractive to me. If you offer a game for free, don't restrict the fun to the people that play.
6644	0	a	The Servers for this game are very bad. EXTREME LAG its one of those games where if your new your not gonna be able to do anything
970	1	a	Great game with some awesome Customizing, only thing i hate about this game is that the weapons you buy are only 7 Days, unless you buy 'em with real money. 
7358	0	a	a peice of â¥â¥â¥â¥ that doesent even load up
1024	1	a	All Point Bulletins...  When this game came out and the servers opened, the game itself was annoying beyond limit : only two servers that were overpopulated almost all the time, letting you discover the joy of something called 'Lag' in 2010, but also an awful stability regarding which system you were running. If you had Windows XP SP3, everything was -relatively- fine ; if you had Windows Vista... well, you were already â¥â¥â¥â¥ed.  One year later, the game becomes Free-To-Play and is even available on Steam in some so-called 'Reloaded' version. After sixteen attempts at keeping the damn software running for more than ten minutes, I gave up : it still full of random memory troubles, especially if you run it with Windows Seven, two Nvidia Quadro 4000, a processor Intel i7 Extreme Edition and 10Gb of Crucial Ballistix RAM.  Like if it wasn't already bad, the game requires PunkBuster, the worst counter bot ever created on Earth. Moreover, the customisation part is ridiculously limited.
10499	0	a	Hoo, this game. Was a lot of fun for the first 60 hours...before the company got bought out by a bigger company. Apparently that company had big ideas in terms of monetizing the hell out of this fairly enjoyable free to play game. I enjoyed it back when it was catching on, but I think the game has definitely taken a turn for the worse when it got bought out. The design is more focused towards getting your money than making the game more enjoyable. When a game does that, even if I already invested 60 hours, I walk away rather than get treated like a bag of money by the game's designers and publishers.
1630	1	a	Unlike said, the game is still playable and not p2w
9528	0	a	It's not a Good game.
7138	0	a	There is no such thing as headshots on this game. Shoot a guy in the head with a sniper and he will laugh and kill you with an automatic rifle while you reload. It seems like every window on the cars are bulletproof. The physics of this game are so messed up.   There is rarely any PvE which is fine. All your missions will be done against the opposition. This makes it hard for a beginner to get sold into the game especially when you have all the seasoned players crowding the newbie district. The tutorial is poor and doesn't explain some of the important mechanics like how to aim-outside-the-window of your buddy's car while he is driving. The elitist get mad when you don't play the game how they want you to play it. Its like they have their own little code of conduct.   I was looking for a clone to replace GTA but I guess I would rather play GTA instead. If you are expecting this game to be an alternative to GTA then you will be disappointed. The only thing this game has going for it is the customization(character, music playlist, guns, cars, and etc). Other than that, the game will make you mad and wish it would improve. Game has potential but the mechanics just are not fit for me.
8032	0	a	Quite an interesting concept, but not my kind of game. Also, I found the graphics &amp; mechanics fairly crude. Mostly tho, as a newcomer, I found it confusing, frustrating &amp; not rewarding, but that could just be my ineptitude at this game. I came to this from Defiance, having heard that this was the better game from that 'stable'. I found Defiance much easier to understand &amp; enjoyed many hours playing it.
7524	0	a	absolutly broken game. the customization if phenomenal the game is great. but the match making in the game completely ruins the game 100%. as a new player you WILL get paired up against people who are damn near max rank and have been playing for years. and the devs are complete â¥â¥â¥â¥ heads who wont fix there game. if you havent been playing for a year youre going to lose. the game is also WAY to heavily reliant on getting mods for your character and weapons none of which come easy. untill they fix the match making i will always say no to this game.
4361	0	a	game did NOT work I hate this
5549	0	a	not for low grade computers
5607	0	a	Was a great game back when it was not yet taken over by gamersfirst (more like payers first). This game ot self is amazing if you dont mind paying. Cause this game is pay to win to its max. If you dont pay you will, even if you are very skiled, lose. The weapons bought with cash ar way more powerfull then any weapon getabletrough playing. Its sad to see this game like this cause i have played from closed beta until and even sometime when it went free to play.
5860	0	a	The launcher of this game was made by drunk two year olds.
6848	0	a	I am sick i this shity game because ost of the robbers are hackers useing thier aim bot and it so easy for them to get money and who idea was it to have a rocket launcher thats thing is too over powered  Fix this game  JarJarGamer
3658	1	a	This game... is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ up. BUT I cannot stop playing it. I guess it's not so bad. I have fun with it even though I hate it. The customization is mind blowing and the broken physics are so bad they make it entertaining.
1864	1	a	I liked APB.. but didn't continue after a couple of plays.. simply becuase it lacked controller support. There were a few features I would have liked to have seen also.. radio stations, more solid single quest modes and not just MP, because if your just starting, single quests is where you learn your tools to play the mp. a more detailed customisation of char. but I havent played in around 2 years so maybe they have these features now.. if your Kb&amp;M and stuck for cash, it's F2P.. worth a tryout, if you don't like then no harm done.
6104	0	a	Call me hard to please, but this game was stupid. I spent half an hour standing around shooting at things and breaking store fronts but had no clue where to drop off the TV's I stole. Also, you have NO CHOICE but to be thrown into a team and HAVE to complete objectives with people you dont even know. I HATE that. I want to roam free doing my own thing, not pair up with some dude who's already screaming his lungs out because 'everyone on the server sucks'  More team based crap full of elitist players who just SCREAM or talk crap. Skip this if you're looking for an open world game with lots to do.
2521	1	a	Such an addicting game! Customization is phenominal, the ammount you can do is ridiculous. It does have a little bit of a learning curve, once you get it the satisfaction is very rewarding! Especially with the new engine underway this game is going to get better!  
394	1	a	its good to me :3
7050	0	a	Its bad 0/10
10656	1	a	So I played this game for a long while. What deca (yes I'm looking at you /u/sil3x) could do to make the game better is to look over some of the community dungeon ideas. Some of these ideas are so good that they are more polished than dungeons that are already in the game. But you guys are already doing such a great job getting straight to work fixing duping and still being able to interact with us and host fun events. Keep it up :)  To any new people looking at this game it is worth playing if you can get past the constant death at the beginning.
661	1	a	...!
480	1	a	This game has a very high level of character and vehicle customization. You can be ANYONE and the game is pretty addicitng! :) Check it out
85	1	a	APB is back and now Free-to-Play! If you like the idea of a massively multiplayer GTA or more specifically Crackdown, then you'll love APB. The character customization is by far the most DETAILED and INSANE that I've ever seen, and me likey.
5142	0	a	0/10 Can't send mail to my friend. Don't play this game.
9973	1	a	Starts off kind of boring but gets fun in the mid game
5784	0	a	Fun untill you loose Premium ;_;  Im not paying for that.
1434	1	a	I really like the game, but I couldnât find the stupid cake.
3075	1	a	cant start it 
8812	0	a	this game â¥â¥â¥â¥ing blows
4581	0	a	this game is stupid
8875	0	a	I used to play this game very frequently and would again if one could purchase crafting queue slots.  Since the addition of the patch 2.4 the style of gameplay has changed. Please be aware that this game is only marginally F2P like WoW, you need a subscription to properly play.  A year on from this review and my opinion has softened, but if you want to play this game without micromanagment and a large sink of your time it will be hard to do so without a subscription. Bearing this in mind, I wait with baited breath for an expansion good enough to lure me back in or some way to permanently expand my crafting ability.
6881	0	a	I went into the game thinking most reviews and some posts about hackers, mass aim-bots and how crappy the game play was just irate people who are simply getting beaten badly as is normal on games that require some eye-hand skill.  Well I was wrong, the game is awash is aim-bots and script kiddies and the game has little to no security to even attemtpt to handle them so yo ucan be runnign down the street bunny hopping and get snipped in the head from 3 blocks away by someone you could never see.  So how the community is even worse then the CoD and Modern Warfare Xbox screachers, there most of the time you just find one or two that might be irritating but in this game, almost everyone is goign to be attacking you or think they are some internet 'gangsta' and have the same IQ as roadkill.
9507	0	a	This game is just not enough it could be nice 7-8 years ago dont download waste of time
5113	0	a	Reloaded Productions put themselves i.e. ca$h over the community, don't bother.
1761	1	a	You can be an 80's cop and shoot people with an LMG.  10/10
5490	0	a	it is â¥â¥â¥â¥ and wont play
8792	0	a	the leaning system is crap beacuse you have to aim in order to lean and it goes into a over the shoulder POV witch is crap i feel like what would make this game better is if it was both 1st and 3rd POV
10575	1	a	This game would be amazing. IF THEY CARED ABOUT AUSTRALAINS AND GAVE US SERVERS  LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
625	1	a	-Join the game -Create an horrible character -Complete your first mission -Start as bronze -Complete(lose) other missions -Insult people with premium stuff -Buy your first weapon from the armas marketplace -Complete other missions -Get silver threat -â¥â¥â¥â¥ing happy -Buy other weapons -Waste time in Social District -Complete other missions -Buy clothes and stuff from armas marketplace -Players hopes you get cancer -Complete other missions -Get gold threat -Run in streets shouting you're gold -Complete a mission -Back to silver -Cry -Waste time in social district -Meet a girl -Play with her -Back to gold -Complete other missions -Back to silver -Waste time in social district -Find out that girl wasn't a girl -Still your friend -Complete other missions -Back to gold -Buy mistery boxes -Win legendary weapons -Find out you spent 1000â¬ on APB  -Repeat these steps   10/10 Would repeat these steps again
7107	0	a	the graphics are just horrible, the gamelay itself is wacky and killing someone in a match is not just difficult but their health gets restored. I know that its a game but if someone shoots you, youre not magically gonna get restored health. the only good thngs in this game is the driving, the character customization and thats it. the game is just a bad gta copy its horrible in my opinion and its a pay to win game. dont waste time on it.
1745	1	a	Good Overal gameplay.
9645	1	a	this gaem suc
2846	1	a	game is pretty cool
4854	0	a	If the creators of Second Life tried to make a GTA Clone, this would be the result.
2770	1	a	A lot of fun, steep steep learning curve as it is mainly focused on non-programmed cover based combat and can lag to an extreme extent.  Pros; -Best customisation I've ever seen in a videogame -A lot of fun once you pass the initial learning curve -Enforcer and Criminal factions are fairly balanced, with Less than Lethal weapons being the only real difference -Ram Raiding/Witnessing crimes and bounties have very fair pay offs -Teamwork really does shine -Premium benefits are well worth the price   Cons; -The learning curve is easily 16 hours of just pure experimentation -The difference between f2p players and Premium players is apparent as the f2p players will be at the disadvantage in both weapons and funds -Expect to pay at least $50 -Terrible AI -Vehicles differ in stickyness and handling -Repetitive missions -Lag will destroy you  Solid 75/100 game. 
1675	1	a	probably the most gangsta game i've ever played my â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
4026	0	a	Classical Pay2Win free2play game. Low fps even on a 6 core with a 7850 2GB. Definitely don't recommend playing.
5990	0	a	GTA for poor people  Pros -... -Riddled with hackers yet not as many as GTA V currently has?  Cons -Pay to win -Extremely boring -Toxic community -Only way to make the real cash is by either paying for it or by playing a hundred PvP missions, or a thousand PvE missions, it's like you're getting punished for not wanting to play against other players, which is extremely dull. -All the cars are basically one big hitbox, you can't shoot people through car windows and the top speed is basically the same for all vehicles. And if you want to customize your character or vehicles to a higher extent you need to pay real money for PREMIUM.  To sum it up. It's dull as â¥â¥â¥â¥.
149	1	a	It's pretty fun to play with friends for a little bit and then it often gets really boring. 7/10
5140	0	a	Game should be called 'Fashion Show With Guns'. Everything in this game â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sucks â¥â¥â¥ except customization.  It used to be fun, but now it could get shut down and I wouldn't even notice or care.  I hope G1 goes super bankrupt, because regular bankrupt is too good for them.
1375	1	a	Okey so reviewed this game way back in its CBT and just when it went live on steam, now its had time to grow and all tho alot has changed and stuff has been added its still no where near the lvl i would like them to be , however thats not to say the game is bad i was hooked to this game clocking in well over 200 hours before i even made the jump to the steam version   the only downside to the entire game is that the rendering system as well as the draw distance and the massive buggy engine made the game dip alot , at first it was overrun by hackers Then that was dealt with in the coming months , now its just performance dips and bad memory leaks , now since the time i did play this ive upraded my PC and it runs alot better at least better than it used to i think , either that or its not optimzed alot for 600 series cards and above from nvidia , but nether the less the game will be fantastic when the new engine update hits  AT LEAST we all hope so , for all we know it could get messed up just like everything else does most of the time they release new stuff.  as for the P2W aspect everyone keeps saying... hmmm yeah i can see that even tho i have spent money on the game around Â£200 worth but its defo P2W no perm weapon avaiable in game that you can actually earn or buy from contacts , and dont get me started on the weapons on the market , i sold my nano the day i got it when the joker box hit , sold it for $7.4Mill and its just as worse as today , obciously any new free player aint ever going to be able to afford that let alone afford a 1-2 Slot weapon etc fora 10 day lease , it was hard to make that money at start and it still is
1767	1	a	Really fun to play once you get into it, easy controls, lots of customization :)
10708	1	a	If you can get passed the micro-transactions that allow plays to become maxed immediately, then there is tons of content and gameplay time you can get out of this. It is not pay to play, every item you see in those shops are obtainable from playing normally and it's really fun once you start to get the hang of the game. Pros- Can be played in a massive group or solo. Several weapons/armours/abilities/rings to farm for per class. Large community for help. A steady learning curve, you will get better. A pretty fair game when it comes to the permanent deaths, you shouldn't have many unfair deaths that make you ragequit. Cons- Spam bots Have to pay to unlock more character slots Hasn't been many major updates for a very long time.  This game just isn't for everyone, but it's free and definitely worth trying out. I'm not that into games with 3rd person view but I have hundreds of hours of this game on the ROTMG website.
5354	0	a	It locked me in the game where i couldent change the volume or exit the game 0/1000

3616	1	a	the game is okay i wish there was no hackers p2w players are not the problem now its hackers i still play it. fun with friends, nice cars, cool events, hackers thumbs down, if you can handle hackers i recommend.
1571	1	a	For 5 years,I have spent my life shooting people in games.This is a nice addition to the amount of third person shooters.I would recommend. 10/10 rekt skrubs

2837	1	a	If your computer is from the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ future then you'll love this game. Luckily, I'm Christopher Lloyd so...yeah.
294	1	a	GTA meets the Sims (as far as character/vehicle customizations go). The has some age on it, but it never gets old driving around San Paro with your posse, doing drive-bys while blasting music from your car speakers. Go Enforcers!

4531	0	a	Cancer   Nah but foreels tho  This game is for a breed of serious gamers i will never fully understand, My best friend plays the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of this game. He admits its not the best game but he is so invested in it he cant stop playing #addictions
7801	0	a	I managed to get a few hours playing this game, and what I found out to my content, was very sad. This game was very fun in the beggining, it had nice graphics, the game play was fun, and I thought it was going to be a very fun and good game. A few more hours of gaming and I learned that the only way to actually get anything is with real money, THIS IS A PAY-TO-WIN GAME, what pay-to-win generally means is that the only way to get stuff or be good in the game is to buy stuff with real money. After I kept playing I saw that the community was complete trash, too. As well as the greedy producers of this game. I do not recommend this game for any reason, unless you are willing to spend a lot of money playing the game and googling things because no one is opt to help you.
9054	0	a	looks amazing first 5 minutes then u say â¥â¥â¥â¥ it.
3582	1	a	One of my favorite
3446	1	a	I haven't played this game enough to rate it. But i can tell that the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s, and weapons in this game are making it awesome! The only bad thing about this game is the community, 50% are hacking russian â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. But i enjoyed myself. 9/10
8694	0	a	The game is fun but the community is mostly consisted of a**holes :(
635	1	a	Great customization, be who you wanna be. Great running gun battles, drive bys.. Like GTA but more freedom and custom cars.
538	1	a	Play from Australia and it is unbelievably delay for driving a car. It is like max out the driving difficulty. :P But what make this game so good is a extreme customisations that I never ever see before.
4930	0	a	it won't let me in to the game :(
10713	1	a	I love this game. While the game is a bit dull by itself, add in one friend and the thing will skyrocket. I've never regretted a second I played!
4463	0	a	As of right now, I'm giving you a bad rating Gamersfirst. I've been loyal to you, spent over $60 on your great game. I love it to pieces, but today everyone was banned. Fix this, and I'll redo this review, and give you an honest rating about the game.
3475	1	a	You can still get money for them big ole heavy tvs' from the shop! I think the games time frame is first nokia phone thru right before flat screen tv.
2955	1	a	Decent game with a lot of flaws.

6135	0	a	Why do I have 31 hours in this game? IT SUCKS! AND FOR SOME REASON I CAN'T STOP FEELING THE URGE TO PLAY IT MORE!!!
20	1	a	APB:R Is a truly outstanding freemium game, You get the large choice of trying to keep peace and order as an enforcer, or burn, smash and wreck the city San Paro. This games offers a new level of customization, you cannot only costumize your self, but your cars, clothes, spray, music, and more.  You will be able to enjoy this one of a kind urban freemium game to the max, even if youre a F2P, Because P2P called Premiums ingame, only get 25% bonus on their income from missions and misc, aswell as their reputation.  This game is highly enjoyable with a friend, and there is plently of room to freeroam in the streets and highways of San Paro.  Criminal: Ram storefronts, Mug people, sell cars, deliver goods, or cause a random destruction! A criminal's limits of income is his fear of being witnessed by any enforcer.  Enforcer: Pin down the Criminals as youre slowly stalking them, and as you see they get more and more dirty cash on them you witness them the last secound to take their loot and return it as edvidence for a big reward. As an enforcer youre not 'allowed' to drive down neutral npcs nor destroy the enviroment such as a mailbox.  The Graphics: The graphical level of this game is also at its max, you can any time turn them down/off in case your computer sadly cannot run it fully, but everything in this game is beuatyful and highly detailed.  Weapons: You will get a free permanent weapon called STAR 556 its a lovely riffle, fully automatic and well balenced, as a secondary you get to carry the Obeya FBW, and there is two other ways of gaining new weapons by Leasing or Purchasing from ARMAS(APB:R shop) By leasing a weapon up to 7 days or use a (sadly) large sum of your money on some permanent weapons.  Vehicles: This i cannot put down good enough but the cars are one of the most enjoyable features in this game! Theyre each very unique and offers a great pleasure as youre driving them around in San Paro, with a friend hanging out of the window or not :)  Enviroment: In the streets of San Paro, you quickly figure out where to stay when youre ramming, or where to stay if youre mugging, and the same for enforcers, many enforcers have their little 'route' they travel to see if anyone is witnessable (Means the criminal and enforcer get to battle for the dirty money). San Paro is a beuatyful city offering many wonderful places to visit, either youre at a dark alley runnning for your life, or at a contacts place having a blast.  PVP!: This game is purely based on pvp, but not only do you need to focus on other players against you but also those who are with you because know what? FRIENDLY FIRE IS ON! :D that feature is out of our reach and we will have to deal with it, I am personally loving that feature as the game pushes you even further to take caution for your enviroment.  Overall: This game is far beyond my belief of a good freemium game, but its balanced alot and well done! few for and against  +PVP +Cars/Enviroment +Costumization +Wide amount of weapons be it leased or purchased. +Open world, freeroam +Balanced freemium gameplay, no-one is TOO overpowered *cough nano,colby,csg.*  -Threat, once you reach gold, youre forced into suicide to regain your silver title. the reason i will put this here is. A gold can only join gold. but a silver can join silver AND gold, and bronze can join bronze silver and gold. -It can be boring to play alone, but as youre going into some missions you will be paired with others.  Last thing i want to add is the community, it can be different from each day but MAINLY people are incredible, ive met a handful of people ive grown a care for. Thanks guys If youre interested in playing with me as such make a Criminal on EU1 and join me :)  I will rate this game a full 10/10    
10365	1	a	I plan on playing Fallen Earth for a while to see how it goes, and as such, this review will see updates from time to time when I see big changes.  *REVIEW* As a player starting off in Fallen Earth, you're greeted by your Character Creation Screen. Everyone seems to have the same kind of build, with height being the main difference. Good choices for customisation and whatnot, but nothing ground breaking.  The Tutorial is straightforward and simple. There is no 'Hand-Holding' as such in it, just the basics of gameplay and combat. Here, you are introduced into what seems to be an OK story.  Why is the story OK? Well, it's corny ('You are special' is what you're told, but yet your just an ordinary guy by the looks of it) and a bit narrative. You don't need a Ph.D to figure out the story from what every NPC tells you, who seem to be devoid of opinions and just state facts.  Controls-wise, it seems ok. WASD, 1-0, Shift+1-0 etc. Pretty standerd stuff, but that's not a bad thing. The controls are quite nice to play with, and I haven't decided to re-bind any keys which is a boon.   Combat is simple enough from what I have seen, but has possabilities in the perks and skills you unlock. IMO, Ranged Weaponry seem to have the dominancy in this game. The rifle you find in the Tutorial is a staple weapon and really easy to use.   The voice actors seem to be good in this game, and they add an air of professionalism to the game.   *Verdict* All in all, a solid game that looks good from the get-go. The â¬0/$0/Â£0 price tag is nice, so I would recommend everyone try this game for at least 30 minutes, just to see how things pan out.
3939	0	a	Doesn't feel finished, unfinished, pay to win, crap. Save yourself the disk space, unless you're really desparate.
1553	1	a	Great Game I recommend for everyone to play. :)
10384	0	a	I honestly don't know how I feel about this game. My biggest problem with this game would have to go to how the map loads. I run on a decent laptop, and at the lowest settings, I get a constant 25-35 FPS. But occasionally, the game will become Microsoft Powerpoint, going to an astounding   1 FPS every five seconds for up to two minutes  . Aside from the horrid optomization, the textures could use a bit of work, to say the least. Even on high, textures are stretched to their limits to cover the large map. As well as that, there's no clear indication as to where a zone ends and another one begins besides a bit of text in the middle of the screen, and the variety is lacking in most respects. Off of the bad and onto the good, the game   is not   P2W. If it were, I wouldn't have 13+ hours in it. There is quite a bit of game to the game, and the purchases are   ONLY   meant for those who wish to support the team behind the game. I also love how this doesn't really even feel like a bulk-standard MMO with the TP/FP combat system. Though spells, called 'Mutations' here, are almost essentially useless, at least from what I've played up to level 7. If the devs put a bit more effort into the optomization and texture work in the game, that'd be nice. Just saying. I still do quite enjoy this game however, no matter how many times the framerate gets me killed because it had a presentation at work to do. I have no clue why, but the game is addicting, I will give it that. But please,   please   don't take mine or everybody elses' opinions on the game, try it for yourself. Depending on your tastes, you may or may not be surprised.   --- EDIT AS OF 6/23/15 ---   Heed thy warning, wary traveler, this game is dead. Dead in the sense that the devs themselves are neglecting it in it's entirety. I understand patches generally aren't a thing that can be pushed out very quick, unless they're small, but we haven't gotten a patch of substance for a LONG while. Long story short, the game isn't being actively fixed, the community is slowly declining, and the gameplay can be attrociously confusing. I do not reccomend unless you are dying to find an MMO in this vein. Even then, there are probably hundreds more of better quality out there.
9239	0	a	WHOOO, EVERY FUN THING IN A GAME: Slow annoying movement, Crappy Ai's, Glitches, Crappy jump, Crappy mission system(its glitchy), Press Y to interact? Most games is press E, Crappy dailog box(it glitches...), Crappy skills.  Well, if ou like that crap ^^^ then this game, still isnt for you... its really that bad, don't play this game.
3458	1	a	Very funny game with friends :) 
913	1	a	The highs are really high, the lows are really frequent.  Though not as much lately!  I've been playing APB on and off since RTW beta and it honestly does just keep getting tighter and better all the time. I can't for the life of me persuade anyone to return to give it another chance, though.  The customisation options alone mark this out as something special, but managing to have a roughly working game where 100 players can drive around in their custom vehicles in their custom outfits playing their customised theme tunes having non-instanced PvP missions against each other on a huge map is even more of an achievement.  It's not GTA and it doesn't have fancy euphoria physics or anything, but when it's good none of that matters.
3433	1	a	This is one of the most broken, poorly coded, bloated, neglected, newbie-unfriendly MMOs I have ever played, yet I can't seem to pull myself away. It's a mess that somehow still manages to provide hours and hours of ridiculous fun. I consistently neglect the mounting hoard of games in my library to play this game. I therefore do recommend it, although I would caution anyone that wants to get started that the game has a rather steep learning curve. The matchmaking is very hit and miss, which means you will likely get curbstomped for a long time before your feet find the bottom of the pool.  The plusses for this game are its impressive array of customizable options, and the intensity of its firefights, which can, at its best, feel relentless and fast-paced. The negatives are its bloated memory requirements, server lag, the toxicity of the player-base, the repetitiveness of missions. and the lack of administrative support.  In the end, however, if MMO GTA is what you're looking for... well, this isn't exactly up to that, but it's the closest you'll get, and for me, that was worth the time.
418	1	a	All around decent game, fun to play either good or bad. Plenty of people play it. PLENTY of mods, weapons, downloadable content etc. 10/10 IMO  Only downside is people who Aimbot or hack. Other then that its a good game, and its free.
6111	0	a	Worst game i have ever played Pay to win Everything is 'premium' â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ servers â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Matchmaking  -2/10
3001	1	a	I find APB Reloaded to be pleasantly suprising. It is more variable and fuller little details than i anticipated. The intensive tempo of game is enough to keep you playing for quite some time. If I should find something negative to say about this game it would be its poor documentation and confusing tutorial.  Even with this limitation I can recommend this game to anyone interested of this type of online action games.
6165	0	a	This game is way too confusing. The hud is useless and overpacked. The maps are really small when compared to gta and such like. The posse system is really stupid and the fact that you cannot spot crimes in progress sucks. (There is a button to press like f4 or something, but that is glitched to â¥â¥â¥â¥). What else... Oh yeah, the community can be unfriendly. Thats the kicker. So I cannot say this game is fun, or I would be lying. Play something else, don't spend money on this game.
5068	0	a	it wont load up -_- 
4103	0	a	I'm not sure whether Steam has marked down the amount of time I've invested in this game, but I'd give it a rough estimate of about 300 hours, between 2012/13, and a quick reinstall in 2015 with a prompt uninstall afterwards.  First impression? MMO Grand Theft Auto with way more customization? Cool!  Or at least you think, until you actually start to do missions, or anything relevant to what your objectives are. Griefers are rampant, and Pay 2 Win mentality is ingrained in what could have been a great game from GamersFirst. You'll be killed by hackers, heckled in text chat for being new (or if you mess up at all over anything), have your eardrums blasted out by post-kill death sounds, and people who you cannot defeat simply because they've dumped (too much) real money into a garbage MMO.  Do yourself a favor, just buy Grand Theft Auto V and be dissatisfied with that. It won't be nearly as frustrating.
449	1	a	I freaking love it! lol. Great game but somtimes its hella laggy. But over all I recomend this game for people who like Saints Row and GTA. Its pretty much kinda like it but more like GTA and less like Saints Row.
10420	1	a	poor graphics, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. much better
6927	0	a	Its a pay to win game!!  Was fun at first before they got greedy and now only cheaters and people with credit cards play. AVOID THIS GAME!!
7909	0	a	Fun to play but the launcher crashes so much you will rarely get to play
10270	1	a	not to bad, but if your playing in a group its a pain in the A** to find them.
4652	0	a	This game has a lot of potential but the amount of hackers and the pay to win system ruins it.
1275	1	a	good a bit buggy but worth the while 9/10
3024	1	a	I do have an Alt which I have about 3k hours on, and by far this game is amazing. Except for some of the people I know, they're â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s. Plus, the hackers too, but Fairfight gets em'.   Def. Recomend this game.
3524	1	a	GTA with customization to boot.
2832	1	a	10/10 This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing awesome. Just like GTA except far more indepth with charactacter and vehical customization. Its massively multiplayer and best of all ... Its free. Only one down side is the Australian server has not been released yet, but I will be patient.

2256	1	a	Time for a real review, I wrote a review several years ago when i was playing this game. APB Reloaded at the time i was playing it. In a watered down statement is fun, However the game has a New player 'hump' so to speak. That is to say that when you start actually playing the game and not the tutorial portion your going to hate the game. This is because this game is pay to win type game. The more money you pump into the game the easier it will be for you. While i played this game the most i ever did was pay for the premium account for little boosts and i bought a DLC. That didnt increase my performance in the game by much at all. My progress was strictly grinding and finding the weapon class that suited my play style. and figureing out how to counter the wallet warriors of the game. I was very good at the game. as a matter of fact i played so much i nearly finished the origional game contact mission providers which would mean i had unlocked all vanilla content. not the new stuff that the new devs that bought rights to have been adding since. Bottom line, if you dont have the patiance to grind throught this game to get to the point were you can enjoy it then i dont recommend. I will warn you thought you will likely be raging every session and find yourself comming back for more. Thats how i was. GG and Good luck.
7039	0	a	It is an ok game but it kind of runs slow on my pc . Also its not that fun to play to me.
2768	1	a	I can't say I played enough to give a proper review. 10/10
2600	1	a	One of the best games I've ever played! Highly recommended for everyone! It's level of customization is too good to be true. It's amazing! I can't get enough of it!
5759	0	a	Started mission, went to objective, own team killed me. Im sorry but what the F**k is the point to this game if nobody is doing the objectives and even stopping others from doing it.
9506	1	a	its god game but i hate when i kill someone he spawns after 20 seconds
8919	1	a	This is a very good game. I love the crafting system, and being able to buy the gear you cant get off of an auction. The one thing I really dont like about this game is... it dosent feel like a survival game. Sure you can food, but all it does is give you some boosts. I would love to see a version with more survival aspects. I'll give this game.....8.5/10
9824	1	a	I dont know it may be good i am gonna check it out
4548	0	a	Tried to play it but it wasn't the open world free to play game I expected, The maps were tiny and there were set things to do on each map which I didn't like, also it kept telling me to kill people with bounties but never told me where they were. All I really did was die and then got bored.
3856	0	a	Game â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sucks. Toxic as hell community. Players hack. People try to ruin your fun. Teamates team kill cuz you're better than them. â¥â¥â¥â¥ this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ waste of a game.
3964	0	a	This used to be my favourite game but now it's terrible. Every time I decide to come back and have some fun with it like the good old day it reminds me how much I hate this game. It's so broken it can't be fixed. Believe me I know G1 tried but they made it worse. I won't even start the P2W topic and the fact that there are many hackers that just don't get banned because they bought some G1 credits.
8680	0	a	This game is laggy as hell with a constant fps of 8-15. Also, this game is a true pay2win game.
8419	0	a	Pay2Win Galore.
659	1	a	It's like a GTA, but online.Visual very realistic and you can make tatooes,change cars and sounds.
4218	0	a	It's â¥â¥â¥â¥.
8870	1	a	How the f*** did I craft a horse?!
4891	0	a	Bad game...very bad.
6247	0	a	Dont Waste your time GTAV is better
543	1	a	APB: Reloaded is not your typical Open-World Sandbox TPS, with over a thousand+ way's to customize your character, vehicle, guns &amp; more APB: Reloaded really set's the standard for F2P Open-World Sandbox games. If you haven't played it yet, I highly reccomend that you do. This game will bring you hours upon hours of enjoyment. I'll admit that when your first starting out it may be a little bit confusing but if you need any help just simply check out the Guide's section on the Steam Store or go search some stuff on YouTube.
8651	0	a	I dislike the clunky controls, yeah, theyre all customisable but its a game, i just wanted to be dropped straight into this with the controls set up for Xbox controller without having to faff about.Tthe graphics are 2004 spec, and leave a lot to be desired. if you like clicking menus and mucking around customising T-shirts, and bits and pieces like your nose, and the shape of your lip then it may be what you're looking for. Sadly i wasnt. I was looking for something to get stuck into, like GTA, but instead its just menu after menu of tiny icons and numbers followed by crappy visuals and clunky controls. I gave up in the end and generally regret wasting my time downloading the 5.3GB, failed updates and a restart, mucking around with making an account and creating a character.  Not for me im afraid, will be un-installing shortly as i lack the patience to withstand the drawn out menus to ever achieve anything, let alone control the character properly or be pleased by the visuals, Sorry
3663	1	a	takes alot of internet but it is worth it if you have good internet
497	1	a	This game is bad. Not the room kind of bad with that classic cult feel or like those steam games you unironically enjoy for under $5 like runaway, nor even the LA Noire type of bad where everything is the just perfect â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥torm of cheesy that sucks you right in. No. This game is just â¥â¥â¥â¥ing bad. It's the kind of bad that just seeps into your pores and skin and constantly reminds you that while this game may have been free, it certaintly wasn't worth the piece of your soul for admission, even if the rampant free 2 play, awful controls and pedo vans won't haven't convinced you otherwise. In short: â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game, it redesigned survival horror in ways Silent hill and resident evil could only wet dream about. 7.5/10 if only for the Richard Nixon mask. Would play again if drunk and forgot about the first time
5351	0	a	This, my friend, is the worst game in the planet. I installed this â¥â¥â¥â¥, got fps drops af with a gtx 1070 and i5 6600, after that killed a team mate, because i was noob af. Then got some weird internet problem (im pretty sure it wasn't a kick, at least it wasn't saying anything like 'You got kicked blablabla')  Meanwhile i was talking with ma bois without any lag.  So i decided to uninstall!  Hope you had a good time reading this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t, but serious just buy GTA!
1063	1	a	APB has to be of the biggest love-hate relationship games I have ever played.   First of all I can say after all the time I've played, this game is not meant for the hardcore gamers because rage will be induced within 35 seconds of starting a mission. The guns are overall balanced (to a point) but almost everytime a new reskin of a gun comes out it is exremely overpowering. The community is...... rough around the edges but mostly fun to play with and against. Customization in the game is fun aswell if you have a creative side. A lot of people can say it's bad and horrible but from my eyes it is still a fun game if you don't take it too serious. Just have fun and don't let the trollish players try to act better than you.   
10168	1	a	Really Interesting Game, If You And Your Friends Like Kinda Sorta End Of The World Stuff Then You Will Like This Game. Although It Cannot Fully Capture The, 'End Of The World' Feel, Being An MMO And All.
1586	1	a	A lot of cons in this game, A LOT. i hate it, but i still want to play it   9/10
9554	0	a	I played this a while back and at first the game seemed pretty interesting, but then I tryed to get an ATV. (I understand this may not have been the best goal ever right at the start of the game.) Anyway, I didn't appreciate the abnoxiously large expanses of nothing. My friends and I were roaming along for a few hours, trying to get to the very distant places to finish the quests to get ATVs. The questline to get the ATVs was rediculously long and it also felt like you had to pay for stuff in order to get anything good. I don't know how it is now, but I don't particularly recommend this game due to the miles of annoyingly empty expanse that I had to traverse.  P.S. I'm sure this is a great game for those who enjoy MMORPs, please make sure to read other reviews. (I'm not a huge MMORPg player, therefore I did not get very far in the game. I also had a bad experience with my friends running off and stuff.)
628	1	a	Pretty fun even though you have to deal with alot of lag sometimes. but it's free and fun to play in the creation screens for everything from tattoos to your cars and character
1043	1	a	Great multiplayer shooter with ok ghraphics so you wont need a great computer to play. Though it is a VERY VERY glitchy game evreytime i hijack a car then go out to shoot the person they dissapear and not only that when i go to hijack a car then i see a better one i stop person dissapeared again! PLEASE FIX YOUR GAME. Would higly recomend  4.3/5
8159	0	a	This game sucks so bad omg , it looks fun but once u start playing it.. its so boring and lame
59	1	a	i've played 'APB-RELOADED' for 3 and half years. Yet i still love this game. reasons i loving it: - Nice shooter game, graphics are cute but after new engine update it will be awesome game. - it's a very successful game for 6-GB little game :D - i can create what ever by the symbols for friends and customers and trade with g1c :D - All my Steam friends are from APB. i don't think u can find that awesome friends in different games :D - it's fun and funny at the same time. Pack of cheaDorrrs getting banned every day. Lucky ones will be punished too :P - Reffer friend stuffs are really saving free players but still free players can trade and be like a donator :3 - Lately they are making awesome g1c buyable packs, new items and getting well on it tho. so future items are brighter. - When you play for fun you enjoy the game. Play to win players never enjoys the game.  - Try to have fun no matter what happens in this virtual battlefield^^ &amp; you will love every thing in APB   (TO BE HONEST!)     Just reviewing this for Steam points.. TEHEhehe...   XD
7803	0	a	Really Bad Game i Played 2 Years And after I retired APB... After a year Today The im Trying to Get into My Account that i had And in-game i Typed my Email Address And My Password After That i waited for while And its wrote me that im Not to Old To Play APB.... And after That i asked For Help in the Gamers First Forums And they Just told me: 'To get out of here your not old enough to play this game.' really Shame And Bad Game it was Great Expiriance But now Bad Game Not Reccomended... 
4829	0	a	eh. its like gta but pay to win.
7916	0	a	i never played it and i could never have played for all the errors that happen
6844	0	a	Not really good, the game just throws you in with no explanation of what to do. Everyone is running around with p2w weapons which can one shot you, your start weapons are absolute useless shot my whole magazine in guy and he didnt even flinch.Also the grenade spam is preposterous everytime you come near a objective you are greeted by thousands of grenades... Loading times are waaay too long which is strange considering that the graphic arent that great. All in all I didnt had a good time also the community are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s.
7542	0	a	HARD TO DOWNLOAD INSTALL THIS INSTALL THAT
2594	1	a	This game has excellent customization, not even AAA titles come close to the amount of customization this game has. Too bad the core game is not as good (a bit pay to win too). Had fun with this though, you really should try this game.
6392	0	a	Horrible game actually....not much to do in the game
7666	0	a	This entire game is based off of the classic 'MMO' grinding. This doesn't translate very well into a GTA 'cops 'nd robbers' setting. This game has so many flaws, 80% of my time playing this was just trying to get it open based on multiple launches. It's not worth the download time and the stress. Don't play this. Jesus christ, between the loading times and the god damned lag when driving a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing -CAR-, WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE DONE EASILY, MIND YOU, this game is a mess. It needs to be pulled into the backyard and shot OR redone from the ground up, which is something I -KNOW- won't happen. God damned. I'm never going to get this time back from my life.  I give it a ten because I'm a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing idiot.
2376	1	a	This game is da sauc.
5971	0	a	Bring back the old APB.

8702	0	a	If you're gonna play it, you'll get bored about 2 weeks after.. Not worth the time.   But had potential :#
2207	1	a	grand theft auto on steroids
21	1	a	This game was amazing in its early stages. It still is a decent game but my opinion has changed because of the market abuse. The game has turned to a pay to win game. I would still recommend the game to anyone who wants to get in a car with some friends and shoot at some cops or the opposite.  Recommendation: Play with the expectation that if someone buys a market place gun you'll be at a disadvantage but on the good side the game has a great customization feature for vehicles and cloths.
921	1	a	It's ok I guess.
3650	1	a	Gang wars with awesome character customatization. I love the game but the only problem is that the developers (thats my opinion not your) dont put too much love to the game because they only add new guns with skins and you need to buy them with money and they do not optimize the game, to make APB more realistic and to increase the quality of the graphics. I mean that is too bad but I give the pozitive review in a hope that the game will be better in the future.
2781	1	a	Really good game overall.
919	1	a	Realy good gameplay mechanics, lots of fun with friends, and what i love the most, is the consumazations you can do there, its one of the best ive seen so far, so much to do and so much to make, lets say your imagination is your creation. you can make your own style, design your car, and even design your own music and alot more stuff to do. But if you want the full experience you need to pay for it, so you are kinda limited to what you can make, thats the only bad thing i can say about it, but the free version is alot of fun to, if you like Gta types of games, multiplayer competetive and co-op , i realy recommend this ;)
1608	1	a	I love how its like GTA
2761	1	a	A very well made Free to play game. Think GTA settings except better everything. there is TONS of customization for gear and cars to make your own personal theme.  Handles lag issues from Australia ok (except for driving but you get kinda used to it). Considering its free to play, it is very much worth checking it. Having tons of fun.
9266	0	a	this game is really horrible . Still a better love story than twilight.
263	1	a	Probably one of my top 5 favorite MMORPGs. I played it back before it became 'Reloaded'. Simply has all the features a MMORPG needs. THEN IT ADDS GUNS! It is a TAD bit repetitive though. Only complaint. I would place it in the top 20 all-time-best list.
3117	1	a	I like this game because its very good action, more than more weapon, and its pretty!
546	1	a	ItsÂ´acceptable
6246	0	a	bugs, hacks, p2w weapons, imbalances   if these sounds great for you, well go ahead play the game and make yourself angry.
3783	0	a	The game itself is fine, however the community is utter â¥â¥â¥â¥. And seeing as this game is online only you are forced to play with them so i think it's ok to downvote this game based on this alone. This games community is the worst i have come across so far. Download the game if you can put up with â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s constantly or are in fact an â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ yourself and want to connect with other â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s!   Worst community 2015.
2904	1	a	OMG THIS IS SO AWSOME

7853	0	a	One of the best examples of a down right PAY 2 WIN game. Don't let my playtime fool you, I've been playing this game from the day it went F2P.  *Driving is â¥â¥â¥â¥, due to horrible delays, it's do-able but certainly not enjoyable. *Firefights are â¥â¥â¥â¥ due to horrible gunplay, It felt like Fallout3 all over again, see a nice gap you can shoot through? Nope, wall. *Collision is â¥â¥â¥â¥. Car is coming right at you, jump out of the way, it clearly hits the wall, dead. *The community is one if not THE worst community I've ever had the misfortune of being a part of.  The matchmaking/District select... You decide to play APB, soon you rank up to Bronze and feel pretty good about yourself, you look through the weapons list and see some cool Rocket Launchers and Grenade Launchers, and some very powerful cool looking guns! It'll take you weeks of playing before you can get those. You join a nice bronze District and decide to do some missions. Oh, look, 3 enemies. 1 bronze and 2 silvers (which have their own District, the Silver district).  Bronze number 1 has the starting assault rifle, the STAR. Silver number 2 has a Scoped N-tek rifle Silver number 3 has a cool looking Rocket Launcher  Golds (highest ranked) play on Silver servers. Silvers play on Bronze servers And Bronze players (the ''noobs'') can hardly rank up due to constantly being harrased by high leveled weapons.  And than, there's the people who try and get DE-RANKED so they can join Bronze servers. Due to GOLDS not being able to join BRONZE servers, they try and get themselfs DE-RANKED so they can have fun killing some ''noobs'' with their automatic grenade launchers and 1 shot kill modded sniper rifles.    The Devs are lazy â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ who obviously do not care about the game itself, and only care about the money. Releasing a new RESKINNED, and I repeat, RESKINNED weapon or vehicle, with new name each week. Instead of trying to fix the MANY MANY MANY MANY â¥â¥â¥â¥ing problems inside the game.  The game is a gigantic Bugfest. I'm finding glitches/bugs I encountered years ago.   See a Bronze with a Golden Scoped N-TEC and call him out on it, expect a ''YoumadcuzUbad''. I'd go as far as to say that the community is worst than that of Call of Duty's. Of course, not everyone, but expect the majority to be complete â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.  Than there's the hackers. Hackers everywhere. Every few games, you'll encounter a hacker. Call them out on it? ''YoumadcuzUbad''. While obviously hacking (aimbotting, wallhacking, no-recoil hacking) It's become so common you don't even have to call it out anymore, nor bother to report as I'm sure they don't care either.   I always try to find fun, in games like these. The fact is, you won't have fun unless you pay for one of those indestructible vans, CLEARLY overpowered weapons, you won't get far.   3/10, if you're new and interested in trying APB:Reloaded, go straight ahead, its worth playing at least once, I'll give it that. But don't expect as much as the screenshots show. The people saying that the game is not P2W, are the people who have spent money on it.
113	1	a	Best game I have played in a long time!
1011	1	a	Good: It's a good game with a big map. You can play with you freinds and spend a holy day of you life on this game!  Could be better: I think the should remove Auto-ready.  Stars: 4,5 out of 5   :D good game   Signed DanishAllstarsGaming 
6831	0	a	i wish i could of played it but it was having dumb and not necessary issues
2476	1	a	Basically GTA f2p
8882	0	a	Appeals to a large variety of MMO players but due to the lack of support over the last few years and the constant downtime and crashing nowadays i just can't recommend this game to anyone.
7380	0	a	if you seriously like this game there is something wrong with you lmao
7807	0	a	Game has micro transactions. I get thats its free, but microtransactions are the only way to play the game? Really? 
4222	0	a	I'd review it if we could actually even play it!! The log-in process on this game is awful. My son, who just got his first lcomputer, downloaded it and was feeling jaded so I downloaded it and was doing no better than he was. I mean, have you ever actually gotten a person who knows nothing about the game to give it a test? All I know is that we followed the instructions and the f-ing thing wouldn't work.
7318	0	a	Whoop de doo. I played this game before it came to steam, but I couldn't write a review because I hadn't played it on steam. Great.  So I installed it, started it up, shut it down and uninstalled it.  That's right, I never went to actually play it here in steam. Why? Because, if it's only half as bad as I remember, then you want to stay far away from this game.  Bad matchmaking, elitst jerks, hackers, money hungry developers, and much more. The company making it calls themselves ''gamersfirst''  ... Don't get me started. but hey, if you're filthy rich and don't know what to spend all your money on. This game is it.  I won't bother telling anything else, everyone who's given this game a thumbs down is summing it up pretty nicely.  It's too bad, really. I loved the concept, and I always enjoy character customizations with few limits. 
1515	1	a	I have no idea what's going on
10122	1	a	While it takes a while to getting used to, it's a hell of a lot of fun!:D
138	1	a	'Fresh and New' free to play.  With a lot of free to play titles, people complain. Concidering that the title is free, I don't understand that.  Anyways, out of the limited time I played, it takes a longer then normal time to understand things. The tiny yet steap learning curve might make you uninstall it out of rage. Beyond that, APB is a reasonable F2P game.  Graphics can be scaled, and durring my time, AA was in beta (how, I do not know). Nothing to blow you out of the water, but solid attempt at reasonable graphics in a free title.  Would I give this a thumbs down? No way. Would it be a 'must play'? No. Is it horrible? No.   You have nothing to gain or loose by wasting a few hours on this -- or by not installing and playing.  6.5/10
876	1	a	Overall its a pretty epic and unique Pvp open world game. Dont listen to all people that try to make it look bad just because they dont know how to be good at the game.  Its not pay2win! U can beat armas weapons very good with non cash weapons. The best weapons like Ntec, PMG, OCA and HVR are all FREE FOR IN GAME MONEY at contacts.  It just takes much time to learn the game (map knowledge, tactics, weapon control and more).   And its also NOT full of cheaters. Of course there are cheaters but its not even half that worse like in many other f2p games. This Game uses Fairfight Anti Cheat. Fairfight monitores how someone is playing (Check  FFBANS.ORG  to see most banned players from APB).  The customization possibilities of APB are just unique. U can almost make every design you want on your cars and clothing :) (Thats why it needs this high amount of RAM) Well about performance its not very optimized because its a old unreal engine version very heavy modified.  Engine upgrade for PC should come after they released the Ps4 version on which they currently working on. But it can run well at 40-60fps when u own a good 4 core Cpu, 8 GB of Ram (its waaay more CPU and RAM intense than GPU intense) and a Gpu with 1 - 1,5Gb of Vram. Of course it depends on your Graphic settings. You can make more detailed graphics Settings with Advanced APB Launcher (search APB forums to find the download for it)..   So give it a try and start learning and u will see its just great.
1988	1	a	Probally one of the worse games to play. Its full of try hards and the starting mission....you just get â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ unless you get a massive group. Wouldn't bother downloading.
3891	0	a	Even for a F2P, this game is utter â¥â¥â¥â¥. The graphics look terrible, the gameplay sucks, and the game gets stale after a few hours.
5043	0	a	iti is rubbish 
1562	1	a	Good Game for free 
2160	1	a	Its a game of anger
799	1	a	Definately has a GTA feel to it, but with insane customization, while it is fun to play free, I would 100% reccomend buying premium, however, G1, the company that owns the game, is completly money hungry as well as a tad â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ as far as sever connection goes, but even with this, it is still a game that is very addictive, and very fun!
5491	0	a	...
8375	0	a	I will say this game has the best customization in a game I have ever seen! but as for gameplay goes, driving in this game is horrible it's like every car is on ice being a free game as well has invited a lot of hackers to play and the game is just dead now.  Don't waste your time.
6695	0	a	I thought this game would have good potential...but I was mistaken. The moderators seem to not care too much that 70% of the people playing are cheating using either a program, or macros.   If you ever even encounter people that aren't cheating, you can have a really cool fun shootout that seems realistic, but most of the time you will run into people that gun you down in 3 seconds using a macro or using a cheat program.   The community is horrible, and full of kids feeling entitled to everything that need to be spanked, and disciplined.   The devs really really really need to fix the cheat system (fairfight sucks and takes wayy to long to ban cheaters), and not even unban anyone that has cheated before.

10782	1	a	Recently, Kabaam has passed the rights to Deca games and we will be getting consistent updates because of this. So it's a great time for old players to come back to the game and new players to try out the game due to the events and freebies we are currently getting. Although there are some issues and suggestions that I want to point out such as:  -Hackers, multiboxers and bots although theres not alot of them anymore compared to before but I've encountered some that ruinied runs and event bosses for some people including me. -Higher resolution or proper full screen since maximizing the game stetches out the window or game making it tedious. -Make deaths less devastating and give the fame currency more application other than pets and guilds -Workshop items maybe such as character skins encouraging people to make a great looking skin and vote which is the best looking skin and release a set of character skins every month. -Make some old skins accessible or buyable other than the lucky box for newer players or players who missed them. -More fun and balanced classes and items or tier -More fun dungeons and events -Less devastating deaths or more rewarding deaths (form of progression).  Overall the game is a fun RPG with permanent death death especially when you meet some people that would help or join you and will make you want to play more and get more white bags or get a white bag. 
4453	0	a	I could write a long review explainging in detail its failures and succsesses but i'll be short. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME UNLESS U WANT TO BE â¥â¥â¥â¥ED IN THE BUTT BY HACKERS. Unless you are a hacker yourself then i recommend this game 10/10 hackingsimulator 2014  This game will will put your hacking skills to the limit. can you outhack your oponent? (enter epic battle music of your choice) Also it runs like a giant turd, not even a small turd, the biggest, smelliest, brownest turd you have ever seen in your life. its truly a sight to behold. It doesnt matter how good you get at this game because some asshat will be using the OP pay to win weapons. even worse, when you begin your journey into the city of San Paro you will probably be up against the best players with the most op guns. â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS GAME

4911	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
7719	0	a	I actually DO NOT recommend this game. It is terrible. Its glitchy as all hell. The game originally launched with a lot of problems. Not sure what the new development team was doing the year or so they were preparing to launch the game, but the result of their work doesn't make it look like they were working much.
6311	0	a	now im using windows 10 and it doesnt even work.
7972	0	a	The video is nothing like the gameplay witch I hate games like that and I think the basic idead of this game was to copy gta and if thats it F u cause gta is way better than this peice of â¥â¥â¥â¥!
10237	1	a	It's not Fallout online, but since falout online got cancelled, this is the the equivalent of Champiosn compared to City of Heroes. It's not what we wanted, but it's a god damned good attempt.
9304	1	a	Basicly Fallout online but not because of copyrights ;P
9547	0	a	Was about 3 years ago I played it, but it was sheer poop so I don't recommend it. I mean come on just look at the screenshots, the game is astonishingly fugly and not to meantion the â¥â¥â¥â¥ blocking atmosphere... Sheeshh....  Oh yeah it is free2play which means it is also pay2win.  I give it a -1337 out of 10
7250	0	a	Used to be fun :( Community=toxic Devs=money hungry Waste of time and money to play it now.
6699	0	a	I have been playing this game for quite a while now, honestly had a whole bunch of fun when I first started, however the game is too pay to win and has honestly been ruined by people who are actually using cheats on the game. Now when I say 'Cheaters' I'm not talking about people who are actually genuinely good at the game, I am talking about the T rank players that join missions and get about 100 kills and 0 deaths. This honestly makes the game quite boring for others and can get annoying when you're doing the Criminal vs Cops districts.  The game can be the biggest pain in the â¥â¥â¥ when it comes to players too, unless you're willing to throw 10-20 bucks into the game to buy yourself your own vehicle, dont even think about trying to make money with other criminals or cops around as they WILL steal your vehicle and turn the â¥â¥â¥â¥ in for themselves. They can also take things from your car even if they're not in the same group as you. (Unless you own it)  I also honestly never really liked the Market system in this game, you could be really good at designing things but honestly, none of the prices were ever realistic.. people would just put stupid symbols and songs up for $999999999 or even $50000.  APB is a fun game and has some good potential, there is just a few things that need fixing before I'd give it a good rating.
459	1	a	GTA but free
9839	1	a	fun looking game can not wait to lvl up
10225	1	a	Like Fallout but multiplayer :D
900	1	a	One of the best games EVER played, it's like BF Hardline, World of Warcraft, GTA V, Watch Dogs and Sleeping Dogs ALL together I'd definitely recommend it. Best thing is, no matter how good you are xD even girls can kick ya a$$ out there.
3689	1	a	After a few hours it will be boring
5886	0	a	Why do i keep â¥â¥â¥â¥ing playing this
157	1	a	If you want to â¥â¥â¥â¥ up a town, this is how you do it in crappy style for free GTA action!
9069	1	a	its just too bad there isnt enough people playing this game. thats what kind of killed it for me. felt like I was playing single player lol. Aside from that, pretty awesome game. I may or may not come back to it.
1517	1	a	My neighbours complain when i die.
1116	1	a	This game makes me think a bit of an online GTA, but in it's own way. Things like chasing the bad guys or rob stores gives the game a fun twist.  It has been a while since I played the game, but I really had a problem with the game performance (even with a decent gaming setup). I hope this got fixed in the last year.
6270	0	a	Cheaters everywhere.
7991	0	a	I am going to change my review now, from the old positive to a horrid negative..  What was I thinking, saying how it's good the game is free to play..  DEVS - (if there are even any) stick a price tag on this game and remove the stupid pay to win benefits, as a new character just on the streets of the multiple towns, I decided to do some missions against the other people in which I would be sharing the city with.  I had my trusty Sniper which I infered did quite a little damage, UNTIL I did this mission.. I decided to take some steps back from the battle and attempt to snipe, I hit multiple times but got destroyed by players equipped in pay to win gear and guns that probably costed more than a CSGO knife, I checked out the store just to see how pay to win it really was..  I would never play this game ever again, I depise this joke of a game. 'APB Reloaded'  They joke you with 'events', the easter event was running round mugging random people and getting eggs, what's fun in that?  â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game.
10366	0	a	I watched this game's download bar with great anticipation. Then I played it. And then I deleted it. After 15 minutes of playing. Seriously. The description states that Fallen Earth blends FPS and TPS into an awesome postapocalytpic RPG and stuff. The first preson mode is trippy to the point of being unusable, while the overall sensation you get while playing is, well, bad. Slighty burning in the gut. Go get S.T.A.L.K.E.R. or Fallout. Seriously.
2918	1	a	Tis game iz lik GTA Saints Row Call of Dutes and Random crap fun, Get it :D (p.s. if you are, go to Colby SW Server)
9276	0	a	this game is really bad. trust me.
1233	1	a	Is a free game where.. well its basicly cops and robbers around a huge city. You can even free roam, steal cars,buy cars to customize from vendors and you can buy guns and more!really i give this game a 8/10 becuase of 1 second delay when driving.
7984	0	a	This is one of those subscription games that had to go free-to-play because they couldn't convince people to keep giving them money, and it shows. The controls are clunky: you have to go through 2-3 menus every time you want to change anything. Anything at all. The vehicles maneuver not quite as well as a fat dog on a trampoline. The player base is one of the worst I've ever seen with regards to team killing 'for lulz' and just congenital inability to cooperate. If you've got your heart set on playing a free shooter with some vehicles, download Planetside 2. Even as flawed as that game is you'll enjoy yourself a whole lot more.
4234	0	a	Nah this games sucks it's just a rip off of every other criminal game, GTA, Saints Row, etc. 
10530	0	a	bad game dead developers  real playtime is atleast 1300 hours, as i played on flash projector.
743	1	a	Verry good game :)!!!! I recommend it too you !!!
4884	0	a	This game requires another 200MB after isntalling with steam and if you verify your installation it gets caught in an endless loop of wanting to redowload the whole 6gigs. FAIL.
10754	1	a	Gives that true RPG feeling, with 'unbeatable' bosses that take tons of people and teamwork to take down.  Love it.

1551	1	a	this game is beast
3166	1	a	Its ok but... IT WONT EVER LOAD FOR ME!!!!!! Im still going to give it a thumbs up becuase i only played 1 min of it and i got scared so i accidently shut it down but what i did do in that first minute was fun.
9993	1	a	Really good game its just like fallout only set online
9359	0	a	i cant even play the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game because when i signed up for the login stuff in the game launcher it didnt even et crreate a username WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4142	0	a	APB has got to be the worst free to play game out there! it doesn't use any antihacking programs and most of it's players have a bad attitude! It's a pay to win game, wich means they ripoff their players because they don't stop the hackers, wich means people who pay for ingame guns to be better really arent because there are hackers everywhere! When you join a mission you will either get kicked from it by the leader coz of your low rank or your team mates will kill you to annoy you, then when you get enemies they will kick you. it's a horrible game to play, it only causes stress! 0/10 from me, i uninstalled it because i hate the attitude of its players. (Games are suposed do be fun and enjoyable).
3903	0	a	It sucks. It's Pay to Win so everyone is able to kill new people instantly.
2349	1	a	just making this to annoy my friends
6010	0	a	Bad game. Not worth any money.
4673	0	a	When you first start out, it's kinda unfair, start a mission and boom, in the game with higher ranked players with basically OP weapons... People kill you in less than 3-4 hits.  How can this be fair to a new player? Now I wonder why it had mixed reviews.
4456	0	a	Got money? Play this 'Free' game. :D
5749	0	a	It's like GTA with micro transactions.
5311	0	a	Its lazy, boring, driving controls are just... no
10537	1	a	I like the game alot and have started playing more everyday waiting for Deca Games to take over.
10262	0	a	dont play this game for it sucks really bad!
5725	0	a	APB had me stoked when I first heard about it. Infinite customization and cops and robber gameplay with a little bit of GTA thrown in. The beta had me worried. Server lag, poor progression, broken weapons, unfinished districts and imbalanced and shallow gameplay and mission structure. But beta is for improvement right? Unfortunately the game did not get much better out of beta and it became one of the biggest disapointments in gaming. The developers went under shortly after and not much was heard about it. Until G1.  They decided to pick it up, dust off the ashes and try to improve things. And improve things they did. It's got more perks, more guns, better matchmaking, map improvements and even holiday events. Unfortunately the game is fundamentally broken. Server issues with the gunplay are still present, the cars drive a little better, but still very floaty and unresponsive. Gunplay itself is spotty. I have enough qualms about 3rd person shooters (seeing around a corner and waiting until someone is close or trapped somewhere to open up on them) before you start adding the multitude of imbalanced weapons, some of which require ridiculous time invenstments to earn, or of course cold hard cash. There are only 5 or so different mission types which you'll be going through over and over, all of which require camping.  And then there is the community. While it's difficult to look at any game and say that it has a wonderful community that will welcome you with open arms and give you advice and support and flowers etc, this game has one of the worst. Many if not most of the people in here are here to troll you. They will follow you with the biggest truck they can and ram you off the road during missions - they will ghost, telling their friends of all your movement or interfering from outside the mission with you unable to do a thing about it - and they will message you with some of the most hateful and insulting things you can imagine just for kicks.  This is still one of the best games out there when it comes to character customization and there is plenty of fun to be had with a few friends. But it has to be asked if it's worth putting up with everything else. I personally say no. This game is not enough fun, even free.
6478	0	a	All I see in Merry Elfin' Christmas. I feel like I should just go back to fantasy MMOs. Also, I cannot find my pants.  &gt;1/10
1655	1	a	This game is really fun! Most people dislike this because of the graphics! If you go into the settings you can change it. Remember this game is free! I recommend this game
3850	0	a	I have really played this game a bunch. Back when it was pay2play.  In that state though the game was alot better. Let me just state it in pro's and cons:  Pro's: + Fun to play together and in clans + RP Possibility + Big map Cons: - Lag, very unstable  - Hackers, oh god the hackers, not normal. Unplayable since the game has been F2P  - Micro transactions are terrible.. - Player base is low..  Play it.. Dont play it. Whatever you decide.  I wouldnt, not worth it.  R.I.P  APB Reloaded.

934	1	a	Great game and its a little pay to win but once you level up a bit and understand the gunplay the pay to win aspect of the game is gone and the amount of custimization is out of this world insane. I love the game and could not recomend it more.
1597	1	a	APB is a great game and is quite fun.

5510	0	a	I'd rather whatch Boku no Pico, The full series instead of playing this game that is more that just Pay 2 lose. WHICH IS VERY SAD. Many Pros got banned beacuse noobs report them as hackers.The company is awful, why even if ebola and aids had a baby it would be better that the company.Dont ever get this game, Why even my game crashed many times and i had the 5th latest GeForce grapics card. I swear this game shouldnt even be on the founders dream/ so screw this game.  (If you dont know what it is its about a anime girl with a d1ck)

10129	1	a	This game is actually so much fun. Yeah it's mostly a rip off of Fall out new vagas, but not everyone can afford games like fall out. This is a great FREE game that's loads of fun, but it does have some really stupid achievements.
7720	0	a	Confusing objectives and unfriendly community that doesn't take the time to think 'Oh, maybe this person is new?' Instead, they just scream at you and insult you. Gameplay isn't really anything that special, and it has a P2W feel about it.
3143	1	a	Best dress up game ever made. Also really fun to play with bros for a while.
7592	0	a	This game... this game is partially unique. But there are SERIOUS problems.  1) There's no tutorial of any kind, you get put straight into a lobby with real people. 2) Those real people almost always have sniper rifles, or a gun that fires faster than yours. Basically, 9/10 times, you're pretty screwed. And those peopleare the ones you have to do missions against! 3) The cars handle like GTA 3, with the tyres popped. On ice. 4) The interface is astonishingly confusing, and like I mentioned before, there's no tutorial. The game assumes you know what you're doing. 5) The mini-map in the corner doesn't show buildings, or anything of much use. The only thing you can really tell is whether someone is behind you or not. But you don't need a map, you have a sniper bullet in your skull for that.  That's just five of the many, many problems this game has.  I highly recommend...Not getting this. Even though it's free, and does supply a bit of a laugh with friends, it isn't much of a game. It's like a concept for GTA.  **EDIT - And I still have no idea what APB stands for.
5715	0	a	Confusing, slow, boring, glitchy, just, terrible.
2317	1	a	Good game, but seriously needs improvement. Just because it's unique, only one of its kind in the MMO genre, that I continue to play it.  6/10  
5086	0	a	1. click 'play'  2. wait to download files 3. click 'start'  4. game crash 20 times 5. delete the game
7791	0	a	This game sucks balls. wont update
9442	1	a	Game has changed a lot, but the old versions used to be really fun and immersive. It's a lot more modernized(microtransactions, pay2win), but is still enjoyable as it has a spark of what it used to be
45	1	a	#1 Free to play game :)

1399	1	a	APB Reloaded: The game that GTA online should've been.  Pros:  -Extremely active devs (Patches come out every 1-2 weeks) -Fairly decent engine although there will be an engine update soon -Plenty of things to do in the open world (Not including missions) -Missions have a nice variety -PVP is the best PVP I have ever seen on an open world game -Loads of fun ways to earn money -Notority Five is so much fun (Seriously, try it) -It IS NOT Pay to Win, I top 80% missions without having spent a single penny on the game -Customizable options for clothes and veichles is so huge you will never get every combination  Cons:  -Graphics -Armas Marketplace -Few hackers (Although situation has got better over time) -Golds playing in lower leagues  You might be wondering why so many negative reviews? This game sucks you in, gets you mugging, ram raiding and everything like that, you start to feel really good, and then BAM you get witnessed and killed. If you play your cards well, you can get plenty of money without being caught by the police.  The tutorial is absolutely fine and gives you some nice rewards if you complete the tutorial sections.  If you are fine with a dated game with absolutely fantastic gameplay; then grab this game... I can't explain how addicting this game really is.
5137	0	a	Where to start? Hackers, Team killers, Unknown lags (graphics), Money hunters, Bad support, Balance,
6720	0	a	This is practically a sucky knockoff of Grand Theft Auto for free-to-plays. The graphics are bad, there is little to keep the player interested for long, customization is limited (unlike Saints Row), there are few game modes, and it feels repetetive. The only redeeming quality is that it is free. 12/100.
5737	0	a	A game that caters to people that aren't you. It will never be you. The game itself is broken at the core and the devs never bothered to fix it, because they are catered in turn by people who aren't you.  In this game you are a statistic in someone else's killrate. It's a round of Counter Strike where you only have a knife and all the other kids have deagles.  Skip this junk and save your hardware from inevitable physical rage violence.
4170	0	a	The only good thing about this game was the character customization. Everything else is absolute shÎ¯t. Also, the developers are a bunch of greedy asshÎ¿les.
3601	1	a	Well i gotta admit its a really good game with a really good story to it, ive played APB for a long time now and i gotta admit its a really good game with a really good story to it, who ever thinks it aint good screw all the haters
6552	0	a	Pay to win Game!!!!
6702	0	a	Haven't played APB for 2 years now. I didn't remember much, besides that my expreience with the game was positive. It was fun.  Now, two years later, I downloaded it and I was very disappointed. The game haven't changed much. Same old problems are still there. Some things became even worse. APB eats up all my RAM for breakfast and freezes after several minutes of gameplay.   It was such a promising project at first, now it's just another failed MMO. 
1716	1	a	A great game of skill, stragagy and car surfing! I highly recomend this game to anyone.
7135	0	a	this game does not work any more so do not down lad this games please.
3610	1	a	the game is good to play for a bit
2659	1	a	One of best Free-To-Play MMO out there! Definitly give it a try. Won't be a waste of your time!
3512	1	a	Pro: it's really fun if u like gun shooting and driving a cool car in one game. Great customization. Many detail for making character, car painting/designing, and music. Best primary guns are free, NSFA/OCA(short range guns), HVR(snipe gun), n-tech/sr15(mid range guns)  con: High computer system requirement. Some guns aren't free. Colby CSG(longer range shotgun), DMR-AV(snipe gun that can deal great damage to cars), Colby .45 AP(best mid range secondary), N-SSW(more stable LMG and w/o slowing too much movement speed). Bad matchmaking. (gold rank players are in silver or even bronze rank districts. Playing 2nd day can put u in a match against max level gold rank....) advance too easy(from bronze to silver and then to gold). Newbies&amp;noobs like me are still trying to figer this game out but we are advanced to silver or even gold. You could even advance if the match was lost. Climbing ladders can be distrupted by teammate. (When this happens too often to me, it makes me shoot my teammate) Latency got higher since server merge(US server)  conclusion:  if u care about winning much, u gotta be very good at the game and team up with other pros.  If u dont care about win/lose, its a fun game to play.
7112	0	a	I keep getting kicked and it doesn't tell me why. 'Player kicked for following reason:' and then there's a blank space. I haven't been able to play for longer than 1 minute at a time
2707	1	a	For being a cop or criminal, this is the â¥â¥â¥â¥. It is one of the funnest games I've played and I totally reccomend it to you. It can be hilarious in various ways. So get a muscle car and ramp off â¥â¥â¥â¥. Go have fun.
3519	1	a	Everytime there's an update, it is harder to get into the game ... HALP. XD
9155	1	a	I only played this game briefly, but it was fun. It did, however, have a steep learnin curve, and not much was explained, so it left a beginning player a bit confused and wandering around a bit. I have not played it in many months, however, so patching and the like may have fixed many of those problems. If you like the post apoc or survival genres, it's definitely worth checking out, especially with its (free) pricetag.
1371	1	a	well, the first thing i can say is the best game ever! :D (for me, at least)  APB is a pretty good game, i could recommend it to anyone, but lets see the things in it that are good and/or bad  the good things in APB: +great character customization! +great vehicle customization! +great designing/designs +great gameplay! +great graphics!  the bad things in APB: -difficult for new players (bad matchmaking :( ) -some possible 'pay to win' weapons to buy for real money -a little bad optimization -very bad community (toxic community :| :x) -cheaters  about the community, there are still a few nice people to meet, but not much.. most of the players are a**holes on APB, but dont give your hopes up! ^^ overall, i think its a really good game, its worth to try it and play it!
112	1	a	If your computer doesn't have 8GB of RAM or more, don't bother installing APB. The constant FPS drops will only frustrate you as you die again and again because of them. Also, this game has an incredibly high learning curve. And don't let district chat fool you: There are not as many cheaters as you think (Maybe 1 or 2% of the population cheats, and teamwork can easily destroy them). Once you get good at this game, it becomes addictive, but the server issues can cause that addiction to break. Also, do not play alone. Get your friends in VOIP and the game becomes so much better.
10457	1	a	Great F2P Game!!
5495	0	a	This is a good game but sadly poorly executed first off the cars handle HORRIBLEY youll be slipping and sliding everywhere also the guns you start out with are crap you will ALWAYS find your self out gunned against other players and the pay isnt good either my vederict is just buy gta 5 that game is good and much better than this
3735	1	a	Im not kidding, but my computer was so bad that 20hrs were spent trying to launch it and one time when I closed it, it didnt close properly.
805	1	a	very good game!! but almost full of hackers :)
3578	1	a	  The game has a lot of potencial, it's good idea, but poorly executed. It can be fun for a bit until you start realising all the flaws it has and it's huge pay2win aspect. The gameplay feels a bit clunky and lacking. The graphics are outdated (although they're getting an overall soon). It has a good amount of character customization, although I would love to see some more settings for it, and different styles of clothing. The vehicle handling model is bad, 'nuff said. The UI isn't always that intuitive and user-friendly, could use a cleanup. The game as a lot of bugs, sometimes to the point of being unable to play. The servers fail to deliver too many times to be justifiable, in terms of ping. A lot of the systems are poorly thought out, i.e. the threat system. The pay to win aspect is really the biggest deal-breaker.  'Basically, this game is cancer. I recommend this game, if you want to get ebola.'  On a more serious note, I do recommend this game, just download it, try out a few of the missions, the fightclub, try out the character customization (which is the best if you like social games), the vehicles, all that jazz.  Have some fun with it! It won't be the most amazing game experience, but it's pretty cool if you have nothing to do, and it can be pretty fun sometimes!
6865	0	a	It was really good when It first came out. but It wasn't even THAT good. It was certainly something new and innovative for it's time but now its just a pay2win cash cow with the occasional cheater mixed in on top of the already nearly impossible to beat pay2win crowd. It still has some awesome features unrelated to the main game such as the customization of your character. (see my publics screenshots on this game to get an idea) You can have your own crew, and cars customized to match. There are ton's of cool guns and lots of cars. You can make friends in the game and just chill out at the social district, or race around the city. But these days not many people play and the streets are mostly empty. which isn't really the games fault. It's just older now. If you like highly customizable games and you have some friends to play with, I would say give it a shot. but for the average player who want's to just enjoy the core game, I would say look somewhere else. preferably at the new Grand Theft Auto.
9084	0	a	Since this game is available on steam, you'd think you wouldn't have to set up another account with some other game site to play this.
3808	0	a	This game is an unbalanced piece of trash, don't bother with it. Customization options are truly amazing which is sad because everything else is full of crap. Came back after a year and it's still the same. Only new content is pricey premium weapons and other stuff. Uninstalled and never coming back.
8232	0	a	To be honest, I did not feel pulled into the game. The driving mechanics felt lazy and the things to do feel limited. Just my opinion and if you have the time try it, for you may have a completely different taste than me.
10032	1	a	Scratches that fallout itch for post apocalypse good overall free to play. 7/10
2606	1	a	Award Winning Rage Simulator - 2011 - 2012 - 2013 - 2014  The classic Cops versus Robbers. Create your own music, create your own logos and design your own clothes and cars. Customization keeps this game alive and a wide selection of arsenal from stun guns to rocket launchers keeps it interesting. The community ranges from the underage to your average manchild. Lots of passion and lots of hate.
6154	0	a	P2W all the way! ourdated grahpics. lagg spikes if your using windows 10. &gt;.&gt;  i'm using 3.50 GHZ 8 GB ram 4 GB of grahpics memory 1 TB SSD
10846	1	a	At least there are monsters everywhere. Better than nothing other than dying on the spawn point instantly.
10360	0	a	This Game Is Pretty Cancer, Most Of Time You Literally Don't Know What You Are Doing... This Game Gave Me Cancer.
650	1	a	Fun but its kinda laggy and unpolished otherwise FUN
4175	0	a	I would not recommend this game if you don't want cancer. I have 1500 + hours in this **** had to create new accounts to play, becaue after their launcher got destroyed, only steam was aviable, and you couldn't log into your account that was from the launcher. DON'T PLAY THIS PAY2WIN GAME. Pros : It was good in 2010-2012 no cheaters nothing, wasn't pay2win Cons: It began to be bad with lots of cheaters, micro transactions, bad engine, laggy servers, no updates just weapon and premium car skin ugrades, etc,,
6031	0	a	this game was boring less player play for make fun guys im no advise you guys go play so badly
10108	1	a	the 3 day install my favorite part
5263	0	a	I would rather swim in a pool of nails and acid while contracting all the STDs in the world with a COD kid â¥â¥â¥â¥ing my mom and having satan repeatedly stab me with a cerated katana that is infested with AIDS. The creators of this game are looking down on the non-pay2win people and get their â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and giggles from watching the major â¥â¥â¥â¥ going on. Might as well be able to pay for aimbot and wallhacks while they're at it.
1879	1	a	Steal stuff from stores, kill Enforcers, Get some nice weapon and start fight against the law!
8427	0	a	The game looks cool just that I can't play the game it just crashes 
5676	0	a	pretty boring game i think. It takes a long time for a new player to get anything at all in terms of cars clothes weapons and so on without spending loads of money for those stuff.  That's why i don't recommend this game.
10315	1	a	Great game. Lots of fun things to do, huge area to explore.
5474	0	a	Lied about the new engine. Games run by cheaters and GM's who ban without evidence.
1890	1	a	Can't even believe I'm installing this again...
8491	0	a	optimized like â¥â¥â¥â¥, boring and unfriendly to new players, half of the â¥â¥â¥â¥ is locked behind paywalls and the other half will take you 3 weeks straight of the same boring â¥â¥â¥ PVP to get

5143	0	a	Don't
3382	1	a	A fun free to play GTA-styled game with lots of customization. Worth trying! Recommended! :)
9901	1	a	I don't recomend this game. I haven't even played it...and that's the problem. It takes forever just to check for updates. When you actually get in the game, there's no cursor or anything. It's hard to push any buttons it displays. I can't even click the freakin PLAY button. If this happens to you, don't even bother. If it doesn't, play away.
1736	1	a	it may seem boring at first but when you give the game a shot you will see that it gets better and better.
1420	1	a	Its Verry Cool and Verry Cool Weapons
2282	1	a	this game is a great conscept, and has a ton of potensual.though this game is not as great as it can be.the game has long load times and,though its probably just my computer,is laggy as crap(if crap could lagg).driving is terribal,i cant even sterr strait.the games missions are confusing,and i can never figure out what i was doing.  there are a lot of good things the game.customization is great,there are a lot things to do with the money you earn in missions, and there are many optians for combat,not just shooting at the bad guy.you can get in a car with someone else and shoot out the window,though the driver cant.you can get on top of most building in the game in some way,which is great for flanking.  the game has a lot of flaughs,but it still is good.i recommend the game mostly because its free.dont get the game for a slow computer like me,but if you can,get the game.  6/10
4734	0	a	Honestly it's the best bad game I ever played. But in the end I'm sad I spent nearly 4 years playing it and almost 6 months of actual play time invested (that's 4k and a few hours) ( and no I don't login with steam often so it's less here.) that I will never get back, don't be fooled by the new paintjob it got with FF, FF is a s-hit anticheat and does nothing to save this game just move right along and play another game. Trust me it's not worth the time get good at a better or more important game.
2199	1	a	Love the game! Just wish there was less cheaters.
9093	0	a	This is honestly only good if you can settle for a crap version of fallout.
9314	1	a	I enjoyed this game, up until the 'how I horse' questions bore through my skull like a diamond bullet. I never really joined a clan, but I did team up with people now and then. Can't say as a single player that I have had too many people try to kill my characters (factions). Haven't played in awhile, but my recollections was that the mods were very helpful, the forums full of information, and the pace was easy and slow (for some parts). Grinding is what you have to do and I got tired of it.
1613	1	a	I love how its like GTA
4847	0	a	downloaded the game played for 1 min lost my eye sight
68	1	a	This is a fun game it is easy but sometimes hard. You can customize ur person and unlock and buy the weapons. As a COP and BAD MAN you can do mission. There is cars you can get and you can buy cars and customize them. LOVE GAME A LOT C: 
7098	0	a	This tryhard tried hard to like this game but it fails hard especially as a FTP.  Lots of neat customizations but none of that can make up for the repetitive missions and gameplay. Having no PVE you can only progress in the game by playing the missions against players. Most of the time I get put up against high level 'Premium' players who resort to cowardly tactics. Players will mostly try to run you over or use explosives. Cant shoot driver out of car. They like camping with a supply box and spamming grenades. Apparently OP pistols and submachine gun pistols seems to be favored.  Despite being the first to fire, being accurate with the rifle, hitting them 50 times (no joke) they can snipe you with a pistol or rush right up to you and kill you in 10 shots sometimes less. Yet those same players get attitude and send whispers calling me a noob and a cheater the moment I manage to kill them which seems quite ironic. All in all that I can still find a few good challenging matches with nice people where the ammount of effort to kill/be killed is equal. Sadly the game either has a major gap between level, Premium, or lacks legit players. 
3246	1	a	Be who you can't be.
8502	0	a	So APB has had a rocky road. Real Time Worlds was the first company to develop and make APB. However, the game was plagued with issues. From talk of supposed ex employes, the game was rushed out for lack of funds. Some employees cam out and posted concept art and plans for what they wanted to do with the game but couldn't because lack of funds. It sounds amazing.  So you had this game come out and it was horrible. The optimization was in a horrid state. Griefing and hackers everywhere. Horrible progression system. Some horrible missions. General horrible map design. To top it off...it cost 15$ a month to play.  Needless to say, it failed. It went under. RTW went out of business (hence the in memorium at the start of the game). The game I think lasted like 2 months? G1st bought them up later in 2010.   Sadly...they've done nothing with it. Lets go over the major changes they've made to the game.  1. New Anti-hack system - this helped with the hackers, but there will always be hackers in the game. Its in a much better state, but as a f2p game...you know how it goes.   2. Fightclub - Essentially they took parts of the pre existing map, put up barriers around it, put it into its own instance, then threw 12v12 battles into it over certain objectives. Not really adding anything. Mainly just...re-arranging stuff.   3. Joker Tickets - a special currency from fight club. I will say that they did add in quite a few items to be used with joker tickets.  4. Cash Shop Introduction  5. Numerous cash shop guns  6. Numerous cash shop clothing  7. Numerous cash shop cars/kits  8. Festival events that often have a heavy cash shop undertone   9. New 'end game' NPC that sells new clothing/gear  10. New equipment/consumables  11. Performance fixes/bug fixes/optimization  12. Removal of 'bad' missions and poor designed missions  13. A 'better' matchmaking system  So over the past 6 years, those are the major things that have been accomplished. As you can see, they didn't really add anything into the game. The major things that can be considered additions are the cash shop related stuff, one NPC that is at the very end, better anti hacker, and their gear, and joker tickets gear. Fightclub wasn't really an addition since they're basically just copy and pasting pre-existing code and blocking off a section of a map that is already there. The asylum is a special fight club only map, but even that is rumored to not be made by g1st. Apparently it already existed in the game files but wasn't quite ready for released. I think it took them like 3-4 years to released it.   Now there are problems that existed in the game with RTW...that still exist.   1. Matchmaking. It's horrible. See there are two things in the game. You have a threat level and a rank level. Now I think the max rank is 255. Rank is required to use some gear and generally tells you how long a player has been playing. Imagine this being like levels in a standard MMORPG. Higher ranks have access to more gear, equipment, upgrades, cars, etc. Threat level tells you how 'good' you are. You go from trainie, green, bronze, silver, gold. It's insanely easy to get gold if you're even moderately good. So how does the MM work? It only takes into account threat level. So I've been in situations where you have a rank 50-110 with low level gear going up against a highly geared 255 rank in gold districts. Heck, even silver districts have this issue. It doesn't end there.  Now this game has districts. Districts are split by threat level. Gold can join gold and silver districts. Silver can join (I think) gold, silver, and bronze. Bronze can join silver, bronze, and green. A gold can't join a bronze district for example. What people do is intentionally lose games to lower their threat level to join lower districts. I just had a fight where you me and one other silver and a traine going up against two rank 150+ gold players in a bronze district.    http://forums.gamersfirst.com/topic/391733-matchmaking-at-its-best/   That's a good indicator at how bad the MM is at its current state. Even with their attempts to fix it.   2. Horrible Map Design. They never really tried to fix some of the map issues. In terms of a shooter, it's still bad. Full of choke points, campable areas, and just general frustration. There are freeways in the game and they're what they sound like...big open freeways. People love to get snipers and sit on them because they're insanely hard to take out since you have to find a ramp and hope you can make it to the sniper before he shoots you as you drive across a big open area.   3. Edge of p2w. Right now the game is basically 'pay money for good gear now'. Most of the guns/weapons you can get in game. Personally I consider 'pay real money now or spend 30+ hours working towards the same gun' to be p2w.   4. Progression is slow. You need to progress roles and contacts to get certain gear. Some gear like upgrades require you to use a weapon to unlock upgrades for it. So if you want to get a certain upgrade for your assault rifle, you've got to use your assault rifle a ton. So if you're in a gold district there's a chance you'll be fighting highly customized weapons with a unmodded weapon. It's very frustrating.  5. Horrible Mission Design. So the only thing they touched with the mission system is taking out missions. Sadly, they can't take them out (that would mean they have to make more). There are still horrible ones. Two off the top of my head. One is called VIP. A player on one team is selected to be VIP and everyone in the game can see the big VIP marker from anywhere on the map. Through walls, etc. Basically taking out any sort of stealth strategy for one team. The VIP has a set amount of lives and the attacking team has a set amount of lives. Putting the entire games success on the hands of one individual that may or may not be horrible (and is handicapped with a 'wallhack' so to speak) is very frustating. I hate being the VIP. It's not fun. Another one is where each team gets a big marker above the head of each member and a set amount of lives for the team. Basically a TDM. Again, no stealth. The amount of times I've seen people standing behind walls looking at one another with third person view waiting for the other to move is a ton. Or they all go to some insanely easy campable area only counterable with a nade launcher (which is like an endgame, last unlocked weapon). Or worse, they get enough kills to be considered 'winning' and then they run around the map running the clock.   6. Optimzation issues. Still huge FPS drops randomly. I think it has something to do with the gun smoke. I can run Gw2, GTA V, planetside 2, elite dangerous, etc etc. However, I still get horrible FPS drops in this game. Apparently they're making a new renderer which I hope will help the game. It's very frustrating to get into a firefight and have your FPS Drop to like 2-5 randomly in the middle of it.   7. Spawning. Spawning in both Fightclub and the vanilla mode is horrible. For example on the VIP thing. The amount of times I've been spawned in road right in the sights of an enemy sniper is a lot. Or wayyy far away from any team members and closer to enemies. Today I was playing fightclub capturing a point and TWO enemies spawned next to the point and killed me. So lame.   The major reason that this game is pulling the numbers it does (peaks at around 2300 right now) is because there's no other game like it. GTA V did put a dent in the population. APB averaged around 2100 players the same month as GTA V release and some months before that. After it released it has been dropping till what it is now...averaging 1400 player. If they actually did something with this game in the 6 years they've owned it, I'd recommend it. Right now it seems like they're putting forth minimal effot to keep it alive and makin money. Maybe they've spent all this time prepping it for console release
3474	1	a	I cant install net framework someone help me please ...
2047	1	a	Great fun, cops and robbers. But look out everyone gets there â¥â¥â¥ kicked once in awhile by overly good players who enjoy a bit of grif. The grif all adds up to the almost school yard feel of cops and robbers, and adds a sense of emersion into the brutal world of a city tearing itself appart in crime and vigilatisem.
6331	0	a	F2P, Free to dont pay but suck it should be called. This game is 100% Pay to Win. Good guns? Buy them for 10$ :( . Well this game could have had great potential, but the greed for money destroyed that. Thumb down
573	1	a	she wants the D.
2306	1	a	I've played this game for upwards of three hundred hours, take heed. This could very easily turn into the most rage inducing game you have EVER played. Take a slot machine, shove inside a random number generator, and then draw a chance card from a Monopoly game and you'll know how â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t the missions in this game can unfold. IF you don't take winning seriously, this games customization alone will keep you occupied.
1204	1	a	I have a love-hate relationship with APB Reloaded. The pros are that it's a ton of fun to play. The cons are that it's really hard to get the hang of, and it's very buggy and crashy. Your screen loading times are also going to suck. But if you can get past all that, it's not bad for a Free To Play online GTA.
9900	1	a	I greatly reccommend this game to people who enjoy story, and crafting aspects, but perhaps not for the people who just want to shoot things. If you're into the latter, then it will also be good for you if you want to partake in pvp or wander and kill things. All around it's a solid game without any of the overly-intrusive money making opportunities that most F2P games take. If you have the money, then you should definitely support the creation of new content for a very solid game.
2872	1	a	this is a really good game if you want to play a game like gta 5 but dont have the cash to fork over. 8/10 overall
9184	0	a	How do I even start this game?
3562	1	a	Cool game
762	1	a	Great way to past time really with friends this denf a squad game. c;
10792	1	a	Good game. Think of it as a Demo.... You Won't be able to master it without putting money in.... Expect death, and realize it's part of the game
6994	0	a	Totall pay to win game, but still fun in a dumb way. 3/10 ign.
7117	0	a	+ Great fun + Free to play + Cool game idea  - Pay to win - Trolling with cars/trucks it too easy
10145	0	a	i think there are some other best games that you can play without feel that you are wasting your time. The graphics are a little poor. The game remmember me like 'S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow of chernobyl' making reference to the 'point menu'.  It will be a better game if the graphics could be better
8418	0	a	Used to be a good game since I had nothing else to do. Now that I have Csgo, this is utter BS. Dont play this. It is basically a game where people who pay for their guns will always win. Spend a little money and actually get a good game you will like rather than play these free games.

1308	1	a	it's â¥â¥â¥â¥'in amazing
9393	1	a	Its great in many ways, for starters its something different, Ive played on and off since game came out and it has been refreshing at times.
7031	0	a	first of all i had to do a 5hour update which isi just â¥â¥â¥â¥in â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t second i had to download the game 2 times and it didnt even launch so dont get this game unless u want to spen 9 hours waiting 
6304	0	a	I remember when I was a console peasant and I read about this game in Game Informer and it sounded so amazing. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

761	1	a	learn any language (english not included) for free
9642	0	a	- It takes too much time to master the controls - The quests are boring - The controls are quite complex and should be simplified - Its difficult to navigate to the easier areas of the map - You'll probally never get a horse  - Its fun to play for the first 5 hours
3946	0	a	Dying game, small community left of pay to win kids, unless you plan on getting hooked into spending close to 100$ (as everyone who is 'successful') I suggest not even downloading this game  even IGN wouldn't give this â¥â¥â¥â¥ a 5
7677	0	a	the game honestly sucks. Its pay to win and unbalanced in the Crimminals favor. they make money faster and when you add pay to win ontop of ythat making them earn more money and more experience it makes the game just no fun. Its â¥â¥â¥â¥ing annoying as hell. the hacker base is endorsed by G1 because they buy the mod and the money goes to G1 so theyre happy as long as the â¥â¥â¥â¥ers make money.
2535	1	a	This game. Hell yeah. You can be the biggest pimp there ever was. Sell stolen computers, mug scurbs on the streets, put on that backwards hat, add a spoiler to that gay car you bought, you can do anything in this game, well, that a pimp would do.
1662	1	a	Best, Game, Ever... Or... Atleast It's Potential, It Still Needs Alot Of Work, But The Idea Behind The Game, Is Brilliant.
5994	0	a	I cant open it
2620	1	a	get apb because u can mug black people
3080	1	a	the game never launches for me =(
6182	0	a	I wish I could recommend this game, I used to play it for a few years long ago (it was fun, especially with friends, the customization is amazing and it's an original concept) but it became more and more crap as time went by...  Why ? 3 things : - The 'pay 2 win' system, no words can describe how cancerous it is... You have to pay a lot for optimized guns, upgrades, cars (and cosmetics as well), that litteraly kick the asses of anyone not having the same upgrades...  - The hackers and cheaters. Always those,ruining everything, there's plenty of them here.  - The community itself. You barely have any chance to find a server where people are nice or helpful with the low grades and newcomers. Or even playing as a team. There's mostly insults, solo-players, and anti-fun people, added to the 2 first points I made above.  It has potential, really, but those things I listed just destroy it all. That's REALLY sad... I miss the days where it wasn't that deep down the trashcan. You can try it out and see by yourself, but quite frankly it takes time to get used to the game and I don't think it's worth sticking with anymore.  Good point to highlight nonetheless : it's free to uninstall.
4195	0	a	This game is one huge piece of greedy â¥â¥â¥â¥. All it does is steal money from you to give to some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s working from their mom's basements making fun at everyone.  Don't in a gazillion years buy this game or anything made from these â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s.
9181	0	a	Not worth your time just an endless grindfest with lacking animations, combat and mondane quest sytem. 1/10
7755	0	a	It's like second life but with a campaign.
7630	0	a	But the guns you win almost buy a car to win WITH REAL CASH!
3185	1	a	love it but is not leting me play anymore 
3142	1	a	i would really recommend this game for players of the crackdown and crackdown 2 xbox 360 games because there really alike 
1190	1	a	One of the best games ever!. I keep coming back to this game, it's so much fun!
42	1	a	APB Reloaded is a great game to play, I met many great friends there and had fun most of the time. Definitely recommend this game for others to try out. I loved the customization ability this game provides. One thing i disliked though is constant lag warps, a big pain. But this might just be my problem. In addition, Gamersfirst (Aka G1) have really expensive Armas prices(where you buy in-game items with cash(Gamersfirst Credits)). Whoever, this game is not pay to win, some may say it is but it's really not. Hope this helped!
4727	0	a	It was good at first but the pay to win has become so extreme that you don't want to play after getting you're a â¥â¥â¥ beat because u you don't want to put 10-100 bucks into a free to play. So I guess if you like a pay-TV - win cluster â¥â¥â¥â¥ with cool customization that takes for ever to unlock... this is he game for you
2237	1	a	Man, what can I say? I'm basically playing my character from San Andreas, busted out of Federal Prison after 10 years!   Different city, sure. But the street feel is familiar. High nostalgia hit for the violent 300lb homie covered in badly spelled jail tattoos. MO Cops and Robbers. Ultraviolent roadrage incidents. Taggin' grafitti spots. Rollin' in a group. Customizing clothes to wear or sell. Kitting out mods to make life bearable against live opponents. 4 levels of Threat: Green, Bronze, Silver, Gold...Open Bounties on Prestige 5 Enforcers and Notorious Criminals. Decent variety of vehicles and weapons to unlock.  Cons:- not real minuses, but worth noting. Playing from Australia on Han server, expect noticable lag if map population is over 40. Still playable with up to 60 on a map, but you better let someone closer to the server drive. Much past that and it's not great. There will be undrawn walls to collide with, stuttered audio and ghosting. But you can always hit the Marina Social District and work on designs, or swap map instances to a less populated map. Unreal Engine Driving Mechanics can be difficult to use. Important to pick the closest server. Match making can feel a bit off at times.  Pros: Multiple instanced maps. 3 mission districs with average threat level displayed, and open conflic maps where the matchmaking is turned off, plus Fight Club. But I won't talk about Fight Club. Unreal Engine Driving Mechanics are easy to learn. Same as basic movement substituting handbrake for jump. If you're a GTA fan who just wants to play Cops and Robbers with some open-world interactions and a story if you want it, this could well be the game for you. If matchmaking is off, or teams are unbalanced, you can call for backup.  Fairfight Anti Hacking seems to work, not much problem with hackers these days. The ban announcements pop up in the chat window for everyone to see. Doesn't appear to be Pay-to-Win, they claim tactics can win over load-out. I've seen that, too. Gold players will hand you your â¥â¥â¥â¥ unless you're an exceptional lower Threat player, in which case you'll go up in rating faster.   This is an &lt;R&gt; rated game. Not for kids. Thought I should mention that. Bombings, Arson, Carjackings, Muggings, Ram-Raids, money laudering, automatic weapons and bad language. It's rated &lt;R&gt; for a m___________g reason, yeah?   Welcome to San Paro.
794	1	a	Fun, free to play, Cops and robbers! Monthly challenges and good atmosphere.
4162	0	a	Even if I would recomend the game to anyone, I still think you shouldn't play it because of the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ company behind it.  I played APB since the realtime worlds time. I love it and played it like crazy. I bought several ingame purcases and spent several hundreds of dollars. And then, boom. I got banned. For no reason at all.  They say I have ben using third party tools. I say I havn't. I mean, I speak in skype with my friends when I play, but that's the only program I can think of.  I tried to tell them that I hadn't cheated, they kept telling me that I had. It didn't matter that I had played hundreds of hours and spent hundreds of dollars. In their eyes I was just a lousy cheater that didn't even deserve a second chance. Even though I had done nothing wrong.  That was about a year ago. I still havn't gotten my account back. I have spoken with both gamersfirst and evenbalance (punkbuster) but I keep getting the same response.  Play if you want, but don't buy anything. Because if do get banned, even if you havn't done anything wrong, you will never ever get your account or the money and time spent on it back.
7499	0	a	Terrible game with terrible shooting mechanics.
54	1	a	This is a fun game so much to do i find it fun to witness crims and robbing stores but overall i recomend this game
8224	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this
6912	0	a	Even after it becamne free to play it is still not worth it, do not waste your time on this.
1336	1	a	its not a bad game.....
2051	1	a	Fun game, ahs a lot of pay to get it quicker type deals but if your are willing to spend the time it can be balanced. If someone spends money it'll likely take you a couple of weeks until you are ready to go toe to toe with him. just an idea of how money can give you a huge advantage. i recommend playing with friends
309	1	a	A great game with endless customization.
8339	0	a	Everyone is a â¥â¥â¥â¥, and the missions are not understandable. And the animations are horrible. DayZ is better then this and Dayz sucks!
6840	0	a	either baltimore or detroit simulator 2015
7128	0	a	I don't really like this game. It isn't what i thought i was going to be. You need to Pay to Win in this game. Can't really understand how to drive a car in this game. Because, when i press 'D', the wheel will turn 1 second after i presses 'D'
6139	0	a	THIS GAME IS â¥â¥â¥â¥
4608	0	a	Wasn't really worth...
7142	0	a	Couldn't even get this thing downloaded, much less play the damn game. I wouldn't reccomend even trying, as they obviously just want to scam you into spending cash.
6387	0	a	Do not be fooled by this game and it's positive comments. It sucks.   First, you create your character with a very glitchy and unreliable character creator tool. You are then thrown into a random place with a tutorial, a gun, and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ clothes. After that it's pretty much play missions, try to get cash, die from people with OP weapons, and repeat.  Not that great, extremely frustrating, MASSIVE P2W, but playable. 5/10. Uninstalled D:
10548	1	a	This game has a long history with me. From Shadow to Kabam to Deca. I've seen it all. Played it in the browser and on steam. I can teel ya. It is a great game. Pay2Win? Ha! BS. Sure, You can pay for cosmetics and some useful tools. But I havent spent a single dime on this game and I have collected most items in the game. But I do warn you. Don't start playing this if you don't have a disciplined mind. This game will steal all of your time. And most people don't have the strength to pull away. Help me... Help me now...
10719	1	a	i love Realm of the Mad God
4712	0	a	I bought this game when it was just APB with Realtime Worlds.  It was frustrating then but enough people played to make it mostly enjoyable. I decided to give it another go and I just can't even get a foothold.  It's an uphill battle the whole way. Max rank, gold threat opposition every single game. Me and the sad team the matchmaking system would scrounge up for me would get trounced every game without fail.  You either have to buy some better gear (which I get the sense they count on), find a team that's good or slog through the grind until you can compete.  Long story short, this game is NOT beginner friendly.  I also need to add that the 'microtransaction' system is nothing close to micro. In fact, to purchase a gun it costs $20 upwards. That's just a single gun. They've taken the notion of a free to play system and add ons that are cheap and gone crazy.  They incentivise it at every turn as well. It's an impossible grind to obtain items unless you buy them. In many games you almost have to have the purchased weapons in order to compete when the other team is packing them. I'm sure most people would rather just buy a game outright and have everything the game has to offer, or at the very least not pay a price for additional content that rivals what a normal game's price would be to begin with.  It's a shameful, obvious cash grab. I would buy something if the prices weren't so outrageous. This system has strangled and alienated the community at a steady rate. I'd be surprised if within 2 years this game is still alive as a result.  ...Not to imply that the current community population could be considered 'alive.'

5940	0	a	10 Hours Gameplay - Naydol/Thor ( Game Tester ) --------------------------------------------------------- - Pay2Win. - You can't do anything as a non premium user. + Fun with Co-Op - Get's bored after a while. - Lags too much.  I will rate it 4/10
1273	1	a	As long as you play criminal, the game is fun.  If you play cop, the game is a constant grind because it is so incredibly hard to make money.
6434	0	a	A total pay to win.
10222	0	a	lagy as â¥â¥â¥â¥ if you like bad garfics and bad evrything this is your game i have a good pc and it kills it it can run far cry 3 in fine gafs do not get this game. and yes i do know its free
4671	0	a	Pay to win, seriously. Also, matchmaking is trash.  In order to get matched against players you have a chance against, you constantly have to backwards-grind to lower your level.  You gotta pay money for good guns, good cars.  'Customization' my â¥â¥â¥, you gotta pay for any good customization items too.
306	1	a	cool game
5672	0	a	The graphics are â¥â¥â¥â¥!!I Played it on ultra and it's â¥â¥â¥â¥!!Don't download the game!!It's a waste of time.The gameplay it's not so good,but it's not even that bad :)
4556	0	a	Cancer   Nah but foreels tho  This game is for a breed of serious gamers i will never fully understand, My best friend plays the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of this game. He admits its not the best game but he is so invested in it he cant stop playing #addictions
3403	1	a	Great game.... Alot of bugs and it's poorly optimized, we've been promised an engine upgrade for years now... still waiting  But the idea and concept of the game is the best i've ever seen.. (Y)
9309	1	a	Good game, definetly worth the price of nothing.
3543	1	a	Very nice customization. That's essentially the main point and drive of the game. Takes some skill too. It's okay.
9721	1	a	i havent played this but the trailer is intresting so i actually might try it out
4525	0	a	best loading simulater ever. -900000000000000/10 would not recomend
2470	1	a	i would really recommend this game for players of the crackdown and crackdown 2 xbox 360 games because there really alike 
4108	0	a	Everyone uses grenades , it has unfair matchmaking and you know when it has a pack for $100 it's Pay 2 Win  Update : So it's been a year since my review so I thought I'd come back and try the game and it was awful , nothing has changed and the game feels even MORE broken than when I last played it , when I was trying to join a mission I was put against 3 players who were VERY experienced , I've only leveled up twice or something but I was going against guys that were in the Gold levels and had awesome gear while I was their with a crappy AK and 0 teammates , yes , the game wasn't giving me teammates. I just could not continue playing , it was so bad so after a year I can say this , it's worse than it was a year ago.
1261	1	a	Genuine fun. It's like GTA for poor people with crappy graphics cards.
9829	0	a	Most fun i had was uninstalling :D
1965	1	a	Fun, but major pay 2 win, hackers , maybe lag and kids running their mouth
9055	1	a	Its a good game for you fallout fans its the same story basicly but divided by sectors. it is fully multiplayer just amazing
10611	1	a	Rotmg in a nutshell: 1. Max 2. Farm 3. Fill your vault 4. Die 5. Rage 6. Repeat  And ofc draggers !   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6c8wn4c8OCo  Short video about rotmg !
3127	1	a	its game good 
3059	1	a	APB Reloaded is a very nice game to play with friends to experience the fun of the game to the fullest! I highly recommend this game if you want to experience what GTA online would be like! You and your friends might enjoy it!
2164	1	a	I really loved this game, unfortunately my computer wasn't good enough to handle any of it's AWESOMENESS...so I had to uninstall it...*sadface*
4869	0	a	Poorly optimised piece of sh*t being taken care of by a company that only cares about your money.
894	1	a	The game has been getting better and I love the way everything is designed within the game. It feels great to play and the strongest weapons are free to play, dont let anyone tell you otherwise.
1252	1	a	Its ok
351	1	a	come play that massive multiplayer online game with alot of jerks 
607	1	a	Great Game, Great Graphics.
8243	0	a	The player base is in very sad shape. However, the game itself is pretty dang cool. Theres just too many negatives to discuss them all in a short review. Its sad really. Once a great game, with a fair share of problems never getting fixed, took a turn for the worst. I played for a few days after quiting 2 years ago at least. And its absolutely horrible without friends. People like to treat ya like crap.
8325	0	a	shait shait why the hell you put noobs with pros ?? idiots
5436	0	a	This game is just bad. I took my time and gave it a fair play imo.  I guess if you like playing dress-up this game is for you.  The whole game is a Con and the only PRO you will hear is...Well you can change the color of your T-shirt,etc.  Boring world with the same missions on repeat. It is like being stuck in a smaller(much smaller GTA title.) with bad hitbox detection or flat out lag or something.No clue but this game can run on a toaster from 2005.  Cops and Crims. If it was as big as planetside 2,or gta v i'd play it again. But all these small scale fps war games suck and are flat out boring and a pain to play.  I am not going to list the bad things as imo the whole thing is utter garbage.
1664	1	a	Don't hate the player, Don't hate the game, Hate the troop man, we take all blame. That you got no money, you got no fame, That you got no honeys, you got no name.  (atleast try it, you wont survive more than a day without your wallet)
3978	0	a	DAT CRASH SO BAD
8753	0	a	Loading simulator 2016. My 1.5 hours was spent either in loading screens or wondering why the game went to a black screen, during a load screen. Never even was able to play the game, when it actually loaded I went to play. Then it crashed
7370	0	a	how come this game does not work on windows 8 
1909	1	a	This is probably one of the best F2P games ive ever seen or played. Just the graphics and customization alone are jawdroping.The game base of crims vs cops is something somewhat new at this level.     Very lovely game ,  keep up the good work!!
5756	0	a	Love the idea of this game. What I don't like is that it feels like playing counter strike. Everyone spends their time jumping up and down to avoid bullets. And the initial load up procedure is horrible.
804	1	a	Countless hours of entertainment, very good game, and it's free... what more is there to ask?
10917	1	a	Its a great game to play with firends and solo! Its a perect pixel game for rpg/mmo lovers!
9972	0	a	so i download this game and it says i need to set up an account so i type my email bla bla bla and then i validate it all and it says i need to install it and i click install and it gets flagged for containing a virus, i wouldnt waste any time trying to install it tbh
3212	1	a	Been playing since 2010, just got it on Steam, great as ever!
7334	0	a	Sure, this game is kinda cool in it's customization aspect but it falls behind in gameplay. This game is 'technically' not pay-to-win, as some would say, but to earn the benefits that paying players get would require countless hours of frustrating attempts to cope with this game.  The gameplay is pretty limited (eg. barely any building are actually accessible) and there are the little things that lower the games value, in my opinion (eg. ladders can only be climbed from the very bottom or the very top; if you are on top of a car next to a ladder, you can't climb the ladder, you must move the car and climb from the bottom.)
1754	1	a	11/10 would bang
9100	1	a	Awsome game !
8939	1	a	Was a great game when I played, but sadly there seems to very few people that actually still play it. Some people say its like Fallout but as an MMORPG.
3387	1	a	This Is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ING Good game
8341	0	a	The ranking system is crap. You can't rank to gold without being put abck to silver even after a win streak. They don't ban hackers. Don't play this game.
9627	0	a	I would quite honestly get a rusty knife, and slowly saw my own arm off, rather than play this game. Then afterwards, I would boil my arm and serve it at the local soup kitchen. This game is god awful, and may god have mercy on whom ever decides it would be a brilliant idea to play it. Dont waste your time.
1768	1	a	Screwin around is awesome
6309	0	a	The only thing I like about this game is the customization. That's about it I don't really wanna use my money to buy perma shooty shoot gun.

9042	0	a	The Pics they show make it look way batter then it is i play very little abd i hated it its a very bad game  one thing more the chikens well sopose to be chikens look like â¥â¥â¥â¥.... i hate this game and shiver to see it......
8940	0	a	I wouldn't reccomend this game to anyone, even people I hate.  Pros: Optomised pretty well for low end machines like my laptop that I play on usually.  Cons: Atmosphere is terrible.  Gameplay is terrible  Has microtransactions  A community with the combined IQ of 70  You get muted without warning for saying 'â¥â¥â¥â¥'  Combat is worse than anything I've seen   This game is the worse game I've ever played on steam, It's optomised pretty well, but that's because it's a money making micro transaction F2P game, go figure.  Don't download this game if you're looking for something fun, or good to play. I tried giving it a chance, and it was terrible.
2851	1	a	Great game if your a fan of GTA series.
249	1	a	&gt; Dad gets this game  &gt; His 1.8k PC cant run this lmao
4370	0	a	Great game, horrible company. Don't trust your wallet and time with these guys, they have banned a lot of good people for doing absolutely nothing. Also, there is only one dev assigned to working on the game, so nothing is getting updated, ever (except for those $50 re-skinned guns that seem to come out every week).
689	1	a	best played with friends :D
3167	1	a	WTF!!!!!  Best game I have played in a LONG time, and the game is an endless world of Murder and Missions, along with ULTRA Customization for Cars, Clothes and Facial/Body features.
10524	0	a	Seriously, Kabam? You just HAD to ruin an already perfect game. I get that paying to get certain perks helps out the devs, but don't make it so that you have to pay to advance. Screw you Kabam.

10680	1	a	It's good, what else should i say?
5298	0	a	If you like cops and robber pvp sure this is the game for you. Although, be warned that the damage system is all f*ck up and will only make you say WTF at every gun fight you enter.   Don't waste your time and money on this game, it doesnt worth it.
64	1	a	Apb Reloaded = A lot of lagg even with a gtx 750 2gb ti OC 40fps. U need a Nvidia Titan black. 16gigs of ram *Its a must* A i7 Extreem edition K version so u can overclock on max. And then u can play the game with 50-60fps. U need to play this game atleast more then 1000 Hours to Counter the hackers with ur legit skills*Most are closets so u can outplay them with your 1000hours of experience* Unless they get mad and put wall hack aimbot all on. btw the new engine upgrade is fake so people stay longer at the game and spend more money.  WELCOME TO APB:R
10827	1	a	I really enjoy it despite the permadeath.
1269	1	a	mugged tons of people, had $5000 worth of stuff, started driving to money laundry, mission started, got shot in the face, lost all my cash  10/10 would get shot n the face again
2574	1	a	+ It's a nice game with decent graphics, and multiplayer. + Alot of nice vehicles, some new would be nice though. + The customization is out of this world, i have never seen a better one + Driving is fairly easy once you get the hang of it. + The game contains some nice tunes in it, that you can access anytime with P. + It's free for play, and not pay to play. + Premium is a nice touch, only that it's pricy, would love some more free premium days! - The matchmaking system is â¥â¥â¥â¥, you end up with gold threat even though you are silver, and if you are gold you end up with noobs. - You usually end up with stupid teammates, and ofcourse they have the worst gun and can't aim. - Griefers with trucks, they ram, slam and kabam you into buildings making you explode &gt;:(. - People speaking other languages in chat even though it's EN server. - Waterfront seems a bit grey, try adding more colour to it. - The 'Whisper' is to OVERPOWERED and should be taken off the game.  i give it a 6/10 :)
8618	0	a	Has the worst matchmaking i've ever seen
9991	1	a	epic fallout like mmo
8321	0	a	not worth 0$
8476	0	a	I feel this game is rather unbalanced atmost.
1220	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥!
2951	1	a	This is probably the best rage simulator on the planet.  I am a very in control person when it comes to fast paced shooters even when my computer physicly cannot keep up but this game has managed to release my inner anger i never knew i even had. But dispite all the times you will be angered, infuriated, and made really mad this game is actually really fun.  This game has great customization over your character and even over all the vehicles you own. You want chrome plated wheels you can have it. Police lights? no problem (enforcers only btw) and you can even make your own decals to put on your clothes and cars and even as your ingame logo.  The shooter mechanics of it are good in that it allows you to peak around corners, crouch, and even switch which hand your character uses. You can also take (except for enemy owned or someone elses personal spawned one who isn't in your group) every single car in the city a civilian is driving and use it and pretty much destroy every sign, car, etc... in your way.  Pros: Great customization. Open World Shooter. Matches, open world stuff, and close, medium, and long range combat.  Cons: Lots of lag and some issues with performance (for now they may fix it) Toxic community (its really bad with the occasional good person.) And the occasional aimbot that will get banned in the next few minuets but does not change the damage it caused.  10/10 Would rage, logoff, think, and log back in again.
4606	0	a	The idea of this game is really good, but the problem is that the developers are greedy and they are liars. Promised engine update in the begining of 2014 and it's now the end of 2015 and still no update. Instead they push out useless guns that are only reskins of FREE weapons (except legendary weapons) and they are concentrated on pushing even more of that stuff. The old players lost hope for this game and this game is dying slow since the devs don't want to actually do something about the outdated graphics and the game engine. The servers are sometimes laggy (atleast for me I think) and the community is the worst. If you win a mission and you do good you get spammed with private messages about you being a hacker.  But there are some good things also. There are almost no limitations in customizing your character, vehicles, clothes. You can create you own music and 5 second themes which are played to the person after you killed him in a mission.  I hope the devs fix this game and stop the useless or sometimes extremely overpowered weapon flood in the ARMAS marketplace.   I wouldn't recommend this game because it has too much flaws because the devs ruined the game and the game is not fun anymore. Would recommend GTA 5 instead of this game although it lacks customization elements.  I hope my review helped.
8874	0	a	I couldn't recommended this game to anyone. I've played it for years and now with the declining player base and lack of care from the company that owns it, the game has less than 200 players at peak times. This leads to an inbalanced system of older players having everything and newer players struggling to get what they need at lvl55.   There are no updates anymore. Events have become non existant and if you need GM help forget it. There is very little oversight from G1. The game is being left to decay. Lag has become a real issue and over the months it has not improved. If anything it has gotten worse.  When I first started playing FE it was great. Lots of players. events, GMs on daily. Any issues were sorted out in a timely manner. It was a very fun game to play. Now it is very different, which is a shame as there seems to be no other game like it.  If you are into PVP forget it. It is dead. Only PVE remains with the very occassional PVPer online.  In my opinion Fallen Earth isn't worth the download anymore.
857	1	a	Very Nice
6999	0	a	First impression bit sloppy Guide Player Base Seems like League of Legends Kids start screaming and flaming the moment it aint going in their favor and come up with petty insults overal the game's garbage
3496	1	a	Ignore all these scrubs with 10,00000000000000000000 hours obviously the game is great if they been playing the game for that long i only have about 80+ hours but here is what i think, This game is great because there is so much stuff to do! imagine GTA except you decide if you want to help the city or gun it down. sure its a little buggy, graphics arent great but HEY the game is free what do expect? for those who havent played it yet give it a try i promise it will be a fun game and even better with friends! just come and play the game with low-medium expectations.
4628	0	a	The perfect definition of P2W. It's a great example of what to avoid, it isn't a terrible game...that being said I wouldn't recommend this game to a friend I wouldn't want to put them towards the toxicity this game's community offers on a daily basis or the frustrations that would be had with this game. Devs are still behind their promised much needed engine re-work and the community is shrinking more and more each week.
773	1	a	one of the best games i have played  
723	1	a	Whats to say about this game. Be ready to die alot. I mean ALOT. you get destroyed by people who buy guns on a free to play game who can kill yopu incredibly fast. But the customization and driving are amazing. You can customize everything, and it feels amazing to have your own logo on clothes and your car. Gunfights require alot of skill, so if you arent that good at video games, be ready yet again to die. But the parkour is so good, you can jump along rooftops, but you cant climb up buildings as in Assassins Creed. Map design is kinda bad, two maps with very bland environments, needs another map. And you need to grind and farm XP forever to get the clothes you want, and it takes forever unless youre premium. Good thing there are plenty of codes for free premium lasting from one day to maybe five days.
5907	0	a	I absolutley..............hate this game. In order to get a weapon that is actually good and you can keep it forever you have to spend real money to get this thing called 'G1C' or 'Gamer 1 Cash.' In order to get the gun I want i have to spend $50. And yes thats really not that much but I could buy a completely different better game exactly like this. Lower your prices and Ill play more often.
3463	1	a	Been playing this for a few weeks now, enjoying the GTA like game in a mmo style, try it :)
8585	0	a	Gets boring real easily. Customizations to your character and vehicles are extremely expensive, and you get killed a lot!
7342	0	a	I'll sum this game up for you in a few words, hacker infested pay-2-win garbage. 1/10 you WILL be disappointed @_@
1035	1	a	this game is sooooo fun
8732	0	a	i use to think this was alright, but now i cant even load up the game
5702	0	a	The game is always running and I can't even close â¥â¥â¥â¥ing close it!
6047	0	a	This game is horrible because there servers lag and there game lags for no reason with the best ping.There moderators are trolls i played the game for 3 hours then a moderator bans me permanantly for no apparent reason i didnt get and email of why i got banned i didnt do anything wrong.
7440	0	a	Just as â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ as the first time this game came out.
8548	0	a	The game will â¥â¥â¥â¥ you over.   You will play it.   And you will soon be trapped in it's loop.   You'll play it and then quit.   Suddenly three months go by like it was nothing.   You'll be stuck in this cycle.   You will play this game and then quit then back you go.   I'm installing the game as I type this.   The curse has come back to haunt me.   Please help me.
4876	0	a	it cool but when you start the gravicts look like crap
4557	0	a	This game have pay to win problems seriously this entire game is pay to win. I love the idea and customization to any vehicle but pay to win meaning pay to do this that anything you want permeantly pay to win. I will say pay to win alot due to the fact this game is mostly pay to win. Free players who didn't want to spend money weapons expire 10 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing days about permeantly feature for us free players. This is very â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t you gotta spend money on customization the game focuses on customization and weapons so limiting free players is like limiting the freedom from the united states. That is why this game gets a 3/10 its too pay to win. So if you like games like this play it but I don't recommend it to people who don't want to pay any money on video games like me. Expect CSGO get that knife and sell it. The game needs more work into the free aspect not the players who pay.
2355	1	a	its a cool game

9073	1	a	yes i wood recommend this game its fun but the grinding sistom needs to get fixed and the leveling the game has lots of fun the game needs to get updated tho and like i sed thay need to make grinding skills ezeyer and the narmal grinding to but yea the game has lots of players cool items lots of quests lots of mounts to use and huge maps i cant see why some pepole say mean things about the game and no good things
3094	1	a	This Game Is Not As Good as U May Think But It's Similar To Saints Row 3 and Grand Theft Auto Except You Have The Choice Of Playing As Good At The Start Or Bad:Fighting Against Crime Or Fighting AlongSide Crime Of Course I Chose To be Good :D But Yeah This Game Is Basically Grand Theft Auto Etc. Rating:6/10
428	1	a	great game without friends i spent about the first 8 hrs just figuring out the game before i got the handle on on it and it was really fun then i started playing it with my brother one of the best video game experiences ever for me

8568	0	a	This game was fun for a while, but quickly got boring. Along with that you've got the most cringe-worthy and toxic of communities, and you just end up with a hot mess that likes to charge you 40-bucks for Pay to Win guns, and overall it's just not worth the effort.  This was a game we all looked forward to and drooled over... but in the end it didn't live up to what it could have potentially offered. And honestly I think a lot of that had to do with gamersfirst being in charge of it. Quit a slimey company, especially if you read any of their official responses on their forums.

1700	1	a	Guns should not be temporary, especially ones bought in DLC Packs  Customization is very lacking for those who dont want to spend 30 bucks on this  Needs more accessible prices, or like atleast a one time fee to unlock the whole game.  6/10 It's repetitive, a bit lacking, and you will find vacant servers, but if you get a friend, it can be fun seeing who is the worst driver.
10637	1	a	be dyin' erey day yo, still ain't mad. But yeah, this is a REALLY, REALLY addicting game. It's gonna be very hard NOT to spend money on it, but it's worth it if you like the game enough.  (edit: a year after i wrote this)  i still die every day, my characters literally do not last for more than 5 days. my mind practically revolves around this game and i've spent around $300 on it. i've invested around 700+ hours on this piece of rainbow â¥â¥â¥â¥ and my deaths actually do frustrate me now because i'm actually maxed.   but anyway, this game is better when playing with friends, or if you have a guild. when it's late and you're the only one up, you can just relax and farm in the godlands. even if you're rich as hell, npe's with friends will help ease the boredom. this game also has its own economy, not like cs:go, tf2, or dota where you could trade via steam and steam chat, but in the game itself, and the company that owns the game will help you with all your problems but they do not care about trading itself, only bug fixes and blah blah. trading in this game isn't as profitable as godlands farming though, due to the amount of time it takes although you could always go on realmeye which is similar to tf2outpost or cs:go lounge to post trades and wait for someone to PM you while youre actually playing the game.  the main goal in this game is probably to max. 6/8 is a start to new players. for players who already have all 12 characters 8/8 maxed with all the gear they want, they usually make another set of backup characters or start a collection - like all the ut's in the game or all the treasures or all the tops.  i see nothing wrong with the community besides (i say nothing and besides in the same sentence ironicly) some chat spammers who could easily be ignored, and even notifers seem to be a problem but i don't mind them. the people are fine though, except for the leechers, but can you blame them? - update 8 months after i wrote the second update: i like how they fixed the notifers. i didn't understand it at first, since i thought any time you entered a realm you'd have to wait 2 minutes but it makes sense on how you could just nexus in case you almost die or store some pots in your inventory and re-enter the realm without having to wait.  anyway, realm lag. it's not your internet, it's realm, it always has been realm. i haven't played in months (though i have around 1,300 hours on it including my hours on steam) and i can see that the lag is slightly better, but not all the way better. there's still only around 3-4 lucky hours of the day where there's no noticable lag. i'm sure with the hella loads of updates they did a month or two ago this summer that they tried fixing it, still i don't see why they can't add more ram to the servers with the amount of money people spend in a month of just playing the game.  i think that's one of the main reasons people stop playing realm. the first reason is that realm is the gamer's heroin and you should probably only play under an hour a day, 3 days a week or you'll get sucked into the vortex of neverending gameplay and the financially broke life.
10355	1	a	I thought the game has some real charm to it. Despite the high level of people who comment, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ing about how hard the game can is (if you can't follow basic instructions then you should be playing on a console, not a PC).
4962	0	a	pay to win
4657	0	a	They put ban for no reason, and you can not do anything to get your account back.  The support team will never ansver on your qostions.  The game itself is good, but if you thinking to play it seriously after some time this game will disappointed you a lot.

10631	0	a	Though Realm of The Mad God may be an excellent game, I have no idea, I found many connection issues while trying to play. This may be due to servers being located in a reach from the UK or just my internet connection but sadly, I cannot reccomend this game as my experiance was very poor.

6427	0	a	FAQ:Why do I hate this game?  A)After playing about a 100 hours in the game i noticed a few things that i hate :  -Pay2Win concept : Are you a rich dude with $400 bucks to spare?Do you like good weapons?Do you like super cars?  If you are willing to spare about $400 or MORE then this game is for you!  -Hackers : Are you good at hacking games?Do you like to cheat and get the upper hand easily?  Then this game is for you!  -Do you like lagg?Do you like crashes?  Then this game is for you!
1753	1	a	i have been playing this game since it was not on steam, i like the game because of the customization of everything you have, car your person and guns. some people say that this game is pretty pay 2 win, whihc yes i can see that you can pay money to buy op guns, but alot of games are like that, so really it just up to personal prefrence
3410	1	a	Get ready to get rustled.
2734	1	a	Great fun free to play cops vs robbers TPS. Battling out with up to 50vs50, can get very intense!

9888	0	a	bow down to the wwestgoat
2108	1	a	Its awfully balanced and the guns that you pay for are clearly better than the ones you get by just playing. Yet i keep coming back to it
338	1	a	Very much like GTA, but less realistic
6846	0	a	100% AWFUL is what you will get when you play this game.... ARE YOU READY TO GET REKT CONSTANTLY BY PLAYERS WITH WEAPONS THAT FAR OUTCLASS ANY SORT OF SKILL? ARE YOU READY TO DO NOTHING BUT DIE AND DIE AND DIE WITH A REVOLUTIONARY MATCHMAKING SYSTEM THAT ONLY MATCHES YOU WITH PLAYERS FAR BEYOND YOUR SKILL AND GEAR SO THEY CAN R*PE YOU FOR EASY MONEY AND POINTS WHILE YOU RAGE AND TRY SO HARD TO DO SOMTHING, ANYTHING TO NOT HAVE YOU GAME EXPERIENCE TURN INTO A KEYBOARD SMASHING SIMULATOR? THEN THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!!!!  I've tried for over 75hrs to enjoy this game and to no avail, people that have been playing this game longer than you will absolutely destroy you no matter what you do. The ONLY features that I had a fun/challenging time with was the custimization YES my Char looked so cool and so did my truck! but thats not what this F*CKING GAME IS ABOUT!!! so yeah, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME to anyone unless you are MLG sponsored or are a glutton for punishment or you wanna spend all your time customizing your char and car.
1198	1	a	great game and best game for driving, talking to friends, and making chaos
5141	0	a	Pay to Win piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥. Uninstalling immediately
9113	1	a	After playing this game on and off since 2012 (and not using the steam launcher as much as I could cos it chugged the game for me for soem reason) I have to say teh game is dieing.   The gameplay itself is a blast and you will have fun for the first 15-20 levels, I can promise you that. The graphics are good,, though not amazing, the crafting system is one of teh best I've seen in an MMO that is not Eve Online, it does the whole real time crafting thing real well. The community has always been pretty toxic when you step into the PvP aspects oft eh game but that is to be expected as some people have grudges with others that span years now or they simply hate a faction regardless of who is on it (there are 6 total factions though now a days they do not matter due to low player count in game and removal of faction based bonuses, the only advantage now is the armor cosmetics and which faction chat your can talk in). The PvE community however is prettygood and open to help people.  Now the bad. G1G (the company that bought FE from Icarus Studios) have been doing the minimal to keep the game ticking over and making money. The game was meant to be spread over 9 total zones and having an in depth and intriguing plot and story line. When G1G bought the game I belive 4 of the zones where done (don't get me wrong the zones in this game are HUGE and pretty well detailed). Now since 2012 to now, only 1 of the new zones has been added and it's one totally thought up by G1G and has practically zero addition to game play. It is effectively a mix of 2 zones or 2 parts of 2 zones I should say, saying that it does look good, it just has no body or soul, it's just that, looks and some newarea to grind in to get a new tier of gear. It's nice however it took over a year to finish and just looks like a rehash.  Now another thing that is a MAJOR killer in this game is MASSIVE CONSTANT LAG. I'm not kidding when I say if your playing early morning in the US or late at night in the US, you will have in game lag whenever you go to loot a body (1-10 seconds to loot where normally it's instant) or if you gather a resource node. It also happens in the chat with 1-5 second lag between hitting enter and the post appearing, if it appears at all (I've had messages just go into the ether and no, not muted or anything, just parts of a convo just never get delivered). These problems result in G1G having to restart the servers at least once a day where they have to take them down for up to 90 minutes, sometimes longer, just so the game doesnt crash.  Now saying all that I must say give the game a shot, it is a good game and the latency issues are newish...well month or two of it happening every day, butif you love post apoc games and just want to drive around mad max style in a car or beaten up dune buggy with a 50 cal on the roof, this is the game for you. It just sucks how most people don't give it a good run past level 20 as at 40+ (level 55 is max level currently) is where it starts to open up and give you freedom to do whateer you want.

6094	0	a	game is too bad to play......developers need to put some more efforts in it  concept of the game is nice but execution was poor
9415	0	a	For some reason i cant play it, it lags and crashes when i press the TAB key to attack. So yeah,not happy about that.
4801	0	a	I come from an unwealthy family and I broke my LCD monitor because of toxic kids in this game that used pay to win weapons. I loved the game for the customisation but it â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sucks donkey â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS GAME â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ OATJAOWJTWA  Edit: I actually have far more than the 23 hours on steam, I have around 400 hours in this game
8745	0	a	EDIT: After having a second account banned for cheating when I was not cheating, one of which was one I had spent money on, I'm going to have to say that since I have now lost a total ~550 hours of time spent on this game, it was an overall negative experience. Such a shame, it could be so fun if there was more community interaction and the customer support at least TRIED to discuss.  This game is great. Best customization I've ever seen in a game. You can have leggings with a hamburger pattern, or a Strawberry Fish tramp stamp.   Don't ask a Sanctum fan about his dark secrets.    Also, it's just about all free, premium just lets you use more at once. The only beef I really have with the customization is the fact that the minimum boob size isn't really all that small.    Flat chest is justice, small boobs are true.     The driving physics can be really wonky, but really funny. For example, flipping when you clip the ~2 inch elevated curb, or trying to go in circles and clipping a wall, resulting in your car lying on its side.  Your character and Weapons can all have mod slots, which usually have upsides and downsides, so you don't just have a sniper LMG with no downsides.  The combat is pretty fun. Basically you run around like a maniac while holding/spamming LMB and trying to keep your crosshair on the other guy. It's more fun than it sounds, trust me. I also notice almost no latency issues such as you being shot just after going behind cover.  Now, something important to note is that this game WILL make you angry. To properly enjoy it, you have to be able to deal with getting stomped. And stomped again. And again. But after the dust and tears clear, you'll stand up, and find that after hours upon hours of being pounded into the ground, you're now a gold, and beating most of your peers and even a fair few players who outrank you. The stomping doesn't go away forever, and comes back from time to time, and usually when this happens, I get quite worked up, but I just play some other game for a while. It probably helps that I have a bit of a masochistic side to me, but I ALWAYS find myself coming back. It might be a couple hours, it might be a day, it might be a week, once it was even months. I was just playing other games, mostly Planetside 2 and Dota 2, I had decided that G1 was nothing but a money grubbing game killing company that barely moved the development along at all.  Then one day I decided, 'Hey, maybe I'll check out the APB forums. It's not like I have anything better to do.' I don't really have a habit of browsing the forums, but I found a thread that compiled codes for free items and premium. Seeing the headphones code, I realized the immense customization this game had, and thought about how cool it would be to make myself look like Sweet Autumn in-game. Eh, why not? It's not like I'm losing anything by playing a couple rounds. I had put on three days of free premium off the codes thread, and I realized that everything just felt a lot better. In my time away from APB, thanks to Planetside and Dota, my aim and reaction time had greatly improved, and I won A LOT of matches. And on top of that, I was earning a lot more money thanks to the premium. A few days later I realized that between the thread and a couple of events that gave small amounts of G1C, I had amassed enough G1C to buy a Joker Mystery Box. I figured there was nothing else I'd spend the tiny sum of G1C on, so I tried my luck, hoping I'd get crazy luck and get a legendary weapon. I didn't, but I did get 30 days of premium, which was pretty cool.  I sat back and realized, 'Hey, I'm actually having a lot of fun now, especially with all the improved customization thanks to all this free premium.' Since I loved the carbine weapon type so much, I bought the permanent version (Which had like three sales on it at the time) off of the Armas Marketplace.  Then, there was a guy standing near a spawn point at a mailbox. He turned around and shot me. I fired one shot back. He invited me to his group. I figured 'Why not?' Long story short I now have a cool new friend because he shot me.    Whoops, don't try this in real life, kids. People don't take it so kindly.     You know, for a low-down, money grubbing, game-killing company, G1 does a pretty good job.  Also on the joker server there's a guy named KuvoskiStrauss who sprays up lots of well-done pictures of topless/bikini clad animuu girls. Also he sometimes does cool airplane posters. I like airplanes.
7222	0	a	just stated after spending an hour creating my caracter there are only three servers with one being unusable  being in the us the only server close enough was a ue sever which was pumping out a ping of 158 not very good  then it took forever to get in the server 30min. after i got in no more that five minutes i get kicked.   in short this game is a wast of time and effort to people looking for a good game to play when no one is taking good care of it in the first place. its like they made it stayed with it and inproved it for a little wile and then abandond it.
10838	1	a	Great game, especially when you get to a high level, but is a real â¥â¥â¥â¥ take when you die
6719	0	a	well all i have to say about this game is that its completely bull crap because every time u try to log in with your email and password it always gives that error 11386 or something like that and u try looking it up on youtube or something to tell u how to fix it we follow the directions and it still doesnt work and its annoying u cant really enjoy this game when u cant even GET PASS THE FREAKING SIGN IN AND ITS FREAKING ANNOYING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i highly not recommend this game
1374	1	a	This game is really fun. Though im really bad playing it with keyboard. Think im going with xbox 360 controller ( which i believe its good for some people like myself ). I recommend this game to anyone interested in 3rd person shooting games. Play if you like GTA, Sleeping Dogs and Crackdown
3356	1	a	;)
10000	0	a	Didn't enjoy the game that much. I think the dev's don't put enough attention on the newer players and focus on keeping their older player base.
5302	0	a	Its a swirling peak of awesome, heavily coated in a foul shell of excrement. I just got through playing wildstar, this game was a brutal reminder of the personal customizaition. You can have everything you want, with a huge investment of time; if you want to speed it up with money, you may. PVP takes up the other half of the game, I really think its never going to be what it should because people refuse to communicate, especially in such an open-world environment; however when they do, the pvp can be amazing. Matchmaking needs a lot of work. i'd give this game a 10, but it's still really rough around the edges, and tbh it probably just needs more funding, give it a C for good effort
7456	0	a	Imbalanced Pay2Win game with a lot of potential, only pay when you have the cash to invest! If you really do it can be loads of fun, watch out for griefers though.
993	1	a	My Journey* my friend recommended me play this game i play then finally done download i join criminal on mission when i was Green Threat i in a Golden threat District someone shoot me i talking to my friend Drama has started:  Me:Bro Go complete the mission let me die!

2081	1	a	this game Rocks
10786	1	a	i do like the game but please fix the oryx castle lag cause A LOT of people die from the lag like my 4/8 archer ppe in a solo candy land when against the gigacorn. (this may be annoying to player who are reading this comment...) So. when we leave a dungeon we should be able to go into the castle,chamber or wine cellar without having players wait about 3 hours for the realm to close again, it would be fair to most players. My idea is they would go into chamber if everyones in chamber, castle if everyone is in castle,or wine cellar,if everyone is in the cellar, it would be cool cause us rotmg players know how annoying it is to do all the lvl 11 quests (the only good thing abt it is the qot) and we only get thechance to go in the castle... WTF IS THAT plz fix kabams errors and we will have rotmg revieved
10614	0	a	I used to play this game on kongregate. Tons of 8-bit fun and then I saw it was on steam, so I downloaded it and for some reason the steam version has tons of gliches and bugs and my game crashed multiple times. Not worth it!(even if it's free) If you want to try this game, I suggest going on Kongregate and playing the flash version. Also for some reason it might say on this review that I have 0 hrs on record. Not sure why, but i have played this game for hours.
3636	1	a	It is a nice game overall and a really good replacement for gta. The games graphic is preety simple, nothing extraordinary. the story is not very complex but satisfying. The gameplay mechanics are simple, just point and shoot kinda thing. For me it got really boring really fast because the missions are preety much the same and the gameplay mechanics are not interesting to me. All and all i think that people that like the gridning kinda games will like it.
8380	0	a	the video hyped it up and in game it was a let down
0	1	a	I got killed by a car going 3mp/h.  10/10
192	1	a	PROS: Cops vs Robbers Extreme Customization for Character Extreme Customization for Cars Lots of Guns Two Open World Maps Modifications that affect the player, cars and guns  CONS: New players at a disadvantage (need to unlock everything) Hitreg can sometimes be a problem Not enough players for fair balanced matches most of the time
4544	0	a	One of, if not, the most unbalanced POS I've ever played 1/10.  Would not recommend. Not even worth writing a full review about.
7692	0	a	Used to be a great game years ago, but now it's complete ****.
7659	0	a	This game is a laggy, confusing, pathetic excuse for a game. Do not waste bandwidth or hard drive space on this game. It's not worth it
2658	1	a	Best Free to Play game out there, the graphics and ability to customize your character make it fun. Not necessary to use real money to advance in the game, i maxed out my character without it.
3305	1	a	APB is what GTA should of been. Best of all, it's completely free.
5642	0	a	No, just no. I was looking for cops and robbers &amp; what I got was a clunky shoot-em-up where the cops act and look like criminals, the game is okay, just make sure its your style.
5904	0	a	You'll only enjoy this game if your good. Other than that its a rage fest. Its not a pay to win, but as I said you need skill to enjoy the game or win it. Other than that the customization is amazing, but you need premium to put more than 5 decals on a car, 25 decals in an emblem, or 5 decals on clothing. The matchmaking is a complete mess, new people will really have a hard time when they get matched up with veterans...  I only recommend this game if you have the patience to die a lot.
4039	0	a	I spent ages playing this game on several different characters. It was fun, but after the security updates these people created, everything went wrong. You try to message the 'support' and nobody replies for ~15 days. I got banned for doing absolutely nothing, and when I tried to get my account back, I was told my account was found using 'malicious files'. Nobody had access to my account, I was getting banned for either being too good at times in the game (where people would report me for hacking when I wasn't) and the staff couldn't take a second to check my account and my files to see if I was actually doing anything. This community is filled with greedy people trying to get money from people and once they notice that certain people stop purchasing their G1 cash for a pay-to-win game, they stop caring about them. But hey, maybe you like this game. It became boring and repetitive anyway. Take it from someone who spent ~200 hours on the game on this account, it's not worth it. I've spent at least $150 on the game (and was gifted another $200, because my friends saw how I enjoyed this game), and in the end even after all the game time everything began to go downhill. The community, the staff, and the increased pay-to-win. Good luck if you still play, and try not to get banned for doing absolutely nothing wrong.   Edit 8/4/16:  I figured I would come back and see if anything was changed, and I wasn't as 'rusty' as I thought I would be. So I went and played around a bit for literally ~9 hours and got banned this morning. I contacted support requesting a refund for even the cheapest skateboard back accessory cause I am not dealing with anymore of this games bs.
4910	0	a	there arent many people in cetain groups which means some people cant play the game properly
1319	1	a	Good game when you spend a little money on. :) Worth the wait of downloading
7551	0	a	latency 9+879186856416547867685175 ,,i wanna buy oca nano and 2-3 parnament weapons but game lag too much ,â¥â¥â¥â¥ it
10287	1	a	I played this game abit now, and I quit for along time, I had no frineds playing as a FEW lost connections. There are minor things, but it is a good game. The first things to KNOW/DO is find the NATURE teacher and get GEOLOGY going and Start farming. Each Town has missions, and then Missions to SEND you to other areas, you dont need to follow them, but they will PUSH you up the levels. There are MANY types of levels in this game.. WORK your SKILLS, and BUILD what you can..Your SKILLS are important...and then Look at the WIKI and decide WHERE you want your abilities.
1537	1	a	If you like rage inducing games, pay to win and somewhat fast paced 3rd person MMO then this is a game for you.
8634	0	a	Day by Day game dying cause lot of hackers and bad Very bad server perfomance! If u want to get free cancer please join the game! Gamersfirst or as many people calling them Moneyfirst dont care about this game anymore. But they care A LOT about ur money so feel free to throw some money on their faces! Have fun!
8265	0	a	Alot of hackers , couldn't play or do a thing -.-
7957	0	a	This game had amazing character customization. purely amazing, the details for styling, and creating your own personal look, is something other games need, BUT, and it is a big but, like on madea. THE GAME SUCKS. the first 30 minutes are pretty entertaining, but after that, it is just a completley horrid experience. shame too. as i said, the customization was nearly perfect. i give it 1/10....no joke 
6837	0	a	all the horrible things are true..... so true..... PLUS if you play as bandit you just randomly surrender.  this game will lower your opinion of the human race no matter how bad it already was
1364	1	a	yes get this ish.....if your low-res likeing dumbass...this game really sucks
3018	1	a	Great free to play 
6558	0	a	After playing 100 hours on it... I guess the game is okay, but the game really needs to be â¥â¥â¥â¥ing optimized, the more I play this game the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ier my computer gets, it's like just playing this game pulls down my computer... I'll list some Pro's and Con's  Pros: -Unique character and car customizations -Nice custom creations(Music, cars, special logos etc...) -The gameplay is pretty basic and fun  Cons: -You'll get facerolled in 9/10 matches -Extremely harsh on newbies -Poor development... the glitches and bugs... I can't even... -Pay2win guns, if you want a better chance at winning matches... pay up. -PVP matchmaking is fked up, you'll be put against higher leveled players. -Horrible servers...  Honestly... if you can endure all those cons, then this game is really awesome, otherwise... yeah, that's it e.e if you can endure it, please tell me your secret... I know I listed more Cons then Pros but I can't really think of anything other good of the game other then the customizations.
8900	1	a	Amazing for a f2p game, the feeling of getting your first actual gun is like getting your first helmet in WoW back in vanilla. The mount system isn't perfect, but is deffinately above par. The crafting system is actually really fun to grind for, and the actual explorable world is massive, none of it feels like blank space inbetween more detailed areas. PvP sounds like it would be a â¥â¥â¥â¥ show, but is actually fairly balanced. Auction house system is deffinately well thought through. Although there are immense amounts of weapons, none of them feel useless or like filler. Quests are actually fun and have some difficulty. There is always someone friendly at the beginner town who would gladly accept help or offer it themselves. Combat is okay, nothing to write home about.
8088	0	a	Needs loot of improvement .... They need to liten to the player base....
6879	0	a	Doesn't accept passwords, takes forever to load on SATA III SSD.
3156	1	a	I would really LOVE to play this game. The character customizeation proves to help you make a unique character and vehicle. But there some downsides in which i should mention... 1. No sign of australian servers. Im from Sydney, so that means playing on a US server is like playing with alot of viruses in your pc. and i mean ALOT. 2. AIs. Yes, the AIs are â¥â¥â¥â¥, like. Very Very â¥â¥â¥â¥. But really, the fun youll be getting out of this is the players. Which is another problem. 3. Players. There really isn't alot of people on the servers, Exept for like, one US server. The rest of the servers are â¥â¥â¥â¥ing empty nearly, i saw a server with 4 people on. Get this is mind, one server PER country, no, one server IN US AND BRAZIL. 4. P2W. Or Pay to Win. Lets get this straight. I, â¥â¥â¥â¥ing, Hate, pay to win games. Sure, it can be fun to play f2p games, but when it comes to that point when you keep getting killed by the same noob who bought a shotgun for 10 dollars. Its just not fair. I have no problem with pay to win games like planetside 2, because the stock weapons are newbie-friendly. But the stock weapons on APB reloaded is just, No... 5. Car mechanics. Oh god where do i begin? You know those frustrating Ice physics you see in games? Its sort of like that. but this time, you driving a car on an ice-skating rink painted black and white with a bit of yellow. Its that bad, like REALLY bad. IDk if its just ther server problems i mentioned earlier or just a bug the developers cant be â¥â¥â¥â¥ed fixing.  Overall, these are just badsides, the customizeations is something deffinately worth playing this game for. i'd say 5/10. If you have spare time, give this game a ride.
2008	1	a	Me and my one friend were driving after this package in the enemy's car and there was a guy on to of the car who had a rocket launcher and blew us up.  69/10
9122	0	a	I came, I saw, I uninstalled.  Though you CAN shoot from horseback, so there's that.
10438	1	a	I just started this game today.I'm not going to lie game took forever to download:(, but after it was done I opened it and it crashed.I didnt really mind because I have a poor quality laptop, then I played it and enjoyed it and i'm still only doing missions for one person with 2 hours.Yea I said 2 HOURS so that proves how much enjoyment this game gives.
1789	1	a	great game to do with a bunch of friends, love the customization abilities :)

8925	1	a	A game you must play at least once in your life (and will probably for the rest of your life).   At first the game is a little (very) confusing but as you progress and figure it out it gets interesting, fun and will take up a lot of your time. It first gave me the impression of 'just another game' but is very far from. It is quest based and leaves you wanting to complete more and more - addictive so to speak and the quests are reasonably challenging for whichever level you are. It has many items to loot and craft, every time you think you've figured it all out and there cannot possibly be any more it surprises you with something new and even more curious than the last.  Another thing I really like about this game is that you can ask for help at anytime and you will get it. Gamers are friendly and willing to help in chat. It gives a sense of comfort for those who 'get lost'.
3132	1	a	Pay to win. 9/11

6424	0	a	This game gave me aids
10177	0	a	OK, I am not saying anything about the game (in fact never played the game), but i am saying somthing about the account system. The account system is the worst thing since the Pet Rock (thats an actual thing). The reason it's bad is because I can't login. Every acount I make from Gamerfirst I can't play with. So I make the account, then put my email, THEN my computer crashes. But it saves my email and nothing else. So when i try and make a new account, since it saves my email I can't make a new account. I can't login because the account doesn't exist. This happened every time with every game. Again not played the game, Just wasted an hour of my life on an account that is not real...
8540	0	a	I used to love this game when I didn't have many games to play, but after going back to it I have noticed how glitchy and also how extremely pay 2 win this game is. Also, it'd be wrong to call this game 'GTA online' but it has a lot of potential and I did enjoy this game a lot playing till midnight with mates on Skype.   But to sum it up, the game simply has reached a dead end, the playerbase is basically dead and the gliches and P2W aspects are just stupid.
581	1	a	The embodiment of the phrase 'Pay to Win' whomever has mommy's credit card wins the misson hands down. The missons are exactly the same idea everytime, break into this , kill that, find this etc.   With all its flaws its still good for about an hour of fun before you get frustrated or realize that its truly not worth your time.  4/10

6492	0	a	It's fun, but it never got the finish it needed to be a truly great game. At this point, I would say wait for GTA V for PC. It's got similar gameplay, but GTA V is just much better in every conceivable way.

643	1	a	This Is An Amazing Game!!! Play It!
6472	0	a	One of the worst games you ll ever play. Its a pay2win game. Even though it tries not be it just cant. Its also one of the worst shooting games i ve ever played, because when you are in combat jumping around and running around will help you avoid bullets as well shooting while zig zaging around the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ place kill the oppoment. Snipers are not snipers, meaning that they dont even have a scope. its all 3rd person everybody! FU SNIPERS! Also the fact with cops vs criminals is one of the broken pieces of the game. 80 people max in a server. Every other server is empty. Did i forget to tell you that you rent guns? no? well you rend guns, cars , and lots of things that makes you baddass in this game for the max days of 10(atleast for guns i know of). I would rate the game 20/100 just because at first i had fun killing my other m8s because they killed me while investigating. I would recommend not getting involved with this game. Waste of time. IGN 10/10
1688	1	a	Fun game. Lots of hackers. Pay to win.

1740	1	a	This game is amazingly fun with lots of customization on your character and vehicles, although it can be limited unless you have premium (Subscription). Great third person shooter with a decent community and really loyal. Yeah it's a shooter but the driving around experience is pretty great also even though there are alot of jerks purposely ramming into you lol, but that's some of the fun. You should definately give this game a try.
7920	0	a	While this game does stand out in so many ways from others, it is flunked and here's why  The good : Best customization I've seen on any game - Fun gameplay ( even though it is super frustrating at times ) - Decent Graphics for the time - Is free - and is FUN  the bad / ugly: In my 5-6 Years of gaming, Never in my LIFE have I ever seen such terrible matchups. When open conflict district came out, I was surprised when I realized that the matchmaking isn't completly random, Only 3 major threats which is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Your 4 man crew which may have total of 100 hours ( all 4 guys combined ) WILL get setup against another 4 man crew of max ranks, each having 2500+ hours each. How is this balanced? Not to mention the prices are thru the â¥â¥â¥â¥ING roof. 80$ for an outfit and a car bodykit. Seriously? I can buy two copies of GTA v for that. The game is SORTA dead. In 2013, Obeya, the most popular server had 5000-7500 Players at peak hours. Now, Obeya has about 1300 peak hours. Colby, the most unpopular server, has about 200 on at peak hours. The game is BRUTAL towards noobs, mostly due to the fact that decent players ( Who are actually silver threat ) get gold SOOO easily and purposely have to dethreat to fight silvers, Leaving no room for the bronzes to learn. There aren't as many hackers anymore thanks to fairfight, but since there are rerolls due to the fact that the game is free, PUNKBUSTER IS NONEXSISTENT and has no banned one single cheater. Cheaters will be banned in 1-5 days from fairfight but then will make new accounts. The game is laggy unless youre on a PC over 1000$+ The worst GM's who ban people who are good against them when theyre streaming. Legits getting banned everywhere. Lack of REAL updates. The last 10 updates have been Armas market stuff ( more stuff that costs 40$ )    Bottom line: APB is such a good game that deserves a try and can be AMAZING with several patches. I would NOT recommend spending a single dollar on this game until the devs get their act together.
7110	0	a	will not load and cant close 
3466	1	a	This game is good. Ive been playing it for 4 years... maybe more I dont know. Most peaople will tell you its about pay2win, but it realy isnt I know it. You just need high skill. You just need strong nerves and some time from start. So I recomend this game because its: open world, perfect customization of character and cars, not many hackers (only no-lifers with super skills) and I hope the upgraded engine for this game will make it better. Also APB is growing every week/month so it never gets bored. Thanks for reading my review.
8832	0	a	This Game is completly â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up Technicaly; there are a lot of Incohenreces with the objectives wich makes you lower your win/loss ratio wich determines your Level(And the more you loose for no reason, the more it'll be hard to progress since the ratio will change each time more slower). There are huges leaks of Memory wich makes your RAM overflow, if you aint got 4Gb ram minimum you'll crash every 5 hours of continuous playing, The Hitboxes are 9 times larger than the character and the perpetual lags makes you die with the least powerfull weapon.Furthermore the actual developers(not the originals) are just using this game to get money so dont expect anything to be solved.  MEANWHILE, The Concept of this game is so awesome that even if you rage every 10 minutes you WANT to play such a cool game; In other Word the player's possibilities are Infinite, you're able to do quite everything, it would just need some stunts like dashing or rolling on sides.  Concept=1337/10 Development=-666/10
9492	0	a	Dumb game has bad graphics, actually didn't mind the ok combat and art style, the little story I read was not interesting enough to engage me, and I couldn't pass this one door in the tutorial because I for some odd reason able to destroy the only key to open the door so I couldn't even play past the first like hour.
4460	0	a	This game is the worst example of a Free to play (pay to win) game, the guns are so out of balance and unrealistic that even snipers don't have a scope view. the only thing that balances out weapons are weapon mods which are only available at a high level which is almost unreachable if you dont have 'premium' because by the time you would reach that  A; you falcon punch through the screen or  B; spend a butt load of cash on the game.   And the matchmaking should be shot and burried you will constantly fight against fully geared player who will Destroy that little, tiny, spec of fun the game has to offer.
9968	0	a	Everyone who has played this game and said it was good obviously doesn't know what Fallout is...
10097	1	a	Not the best mmo on the net, but a great opportunity for apocaliptic-lovers.
6594	0	a	Pay to win. Nuff said
6164	0	a	do not buy this game it does not work
6023	0	a	Bad company. 1- Many bugs in-game 1- bad community 1-
4629	0	a	I tough i would give this game a chance again with my friend but afther i read someone s review and realized what ADMINS are like in this game i probably will just play it cuz of my friend other than that its â¥â¥â¥â¥ game even back when i played it couple of months ago.
4658	0	a	-Pay 2 win cancer -Cheater cancer -Russian cancer -â¥â¥â¥â¥ graphics cancer -Bad performance cancer -Servers are â¥â¥â¥â¥ cancer.  +Can put hentai on anything.   1/10, hentai might save this game.
1975	1	a	I love the game, the easy symbol creation, the cool cars, the guns, the cars... Im playing this game quite some time now and i must say that this game is a great game! When i checked it out the first time i was like lets see what the game can do. When i played some time i knew that this game is great made. So now by playing it some time i became a fan!  
6998	0	a	It was once a good game, now broken by bad devolopers, bad matchmaking, and greedy developers.
375	1	a	Its OK
1388	1	a	First time playing this game, looks like a fun game but looks like GTA
2597	1	a	If gta and Saints row had a free to play baby
10896	1	a	Yes, this game is very addicting and i cant get off of it.
10520	0	a	It's pretty sad to see such an awesome game go from free 2 play to pay 2 win. It costs 10 dollars just to change your character's name. If you can not stop yourself from buying game items that are good your character then DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. Otherwise you may have decent fun.
5056	0	a	It's free, it's fun, and it got loads of customizations!  But sadly, the community is horrible, filled with trashtalkers and hackers.  It also get boring fast due to lack of game modes with PVP system only.  I wouldn't recommend this game lest you're the type of a gamer who's competitive or masochistic.
3581	1	a	Is it me or is the stearing slow
7071	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥.
5714	0	a	I should start off by saying this game is 2laggy4me which puts me off in the first place but oh hohohho do not worry I have far more to talk about.  Now the only positive in this game is customization. You can truly make everything unique and it can be pretty fun to make your own car. But now lets start with everything â¥â¥â¥â¥ the matchmaking puts you in with people who hack, have rocket launchers and who have dial up connection the hackers are at a fault of punkbuster and the rest is the result of people who play too long and people from far away countries. I constantly get put into a team with people from Spain (nothing against Spain) but they don't spek English and more importantly I don't speak Spanish so I can't coordinate. Next are the missions there all the same and pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥. Sandbox you ask? None oh sure there's a huge world but everytime I turn off matchmaking I just get put into a match anyway and even if i did roam most of the time they can't be killed unless you go into the pvp place (rocket launchers and â¥â¥â¥â¥ galore). There isn't much to do really it has alot of things but doesn't perfect â¥â¥â¥â¥. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY IT'S â¥â¥â¥â¥ING P2W â¥â¥â¥â¥ AND IT SHOULD DIE. Except the customization idk put it in a good sandbox game like GTA
7161	0	a	 ===Citizen's Review====
7547	0	a	Fun yet stupid game if your going to play this you either need a lot of money or you need to be able to withstand lots and lots of rage and stupid â¥â¥â¥â¥ matchmaking is broke as â¥â¥â¥â¥
2549	1	a	APB Reloaded is a fast paced, shoot em up, Free to play, open world strategy combat MMO; and if you are any good at it, you hate it with a passion.   I recommend it.
99	1	a	It's an awesome game, best played with friends i really like it to be honest. It's not that bad
6315	0	a	The apb radio's song 'Give me that..'  gimme that pistol gimme that swag gimme that event gimme that lag gimme that green gimme that golds gimme that aimbot gimme that BAN gimme that refer a frend gimme that io growl  gimme that â¥â¥â¥ gimme that fake engine update gimme that UNINSTALL BUTTON &lt;3
10079	1	a	Fallen Earth was OK.Not one of the best games I played,but not terrible.There are many errors to it,and in the beggining the gameplay is a little dull,but overall its a decent game mostly for fans of fallout 3.
10741	1	a	its free and its a good game!
4251	0	a	Played it for a little bit.  Didn't care for it very much.
6232	0	a	i played this game
7304	0	a	Even the login 'feature' doesn't work. That's quite an achievement.  Unplayable, literally.
234	1	a	I love this game, it reminds me a lot of the Saints Row games. If you like pvp and shooters I would recommend this one. I'm still VERY new to this game, I'm learning the basics at the moment but I play this game a lot. Its tons of fun!
56	1	a	Simply the best.
7217	0	a	Didn't load so I got 40 something hrs with out doing anything
10014	1	a	yes this game is old yes this game is buggy and does not have the best combat but this is not a simple game , its actually very challenging and rewarding game crafting is owesome and unlike any other game i have found.  There are no classes you make your own and have fun with it, leveling is slow but fun because you get to enjoy a lot of content tthe game map is massive and filled with dungeons and cool places to explore i played mmos for more than 10 years and never had anything come close to a game that is as unique as this one ,   Try this game have some patience learn how to play it and dont listen to those guys who just loged in and didnt understand anything , you cant learn to play a game in 10 minutes   also ifyou have at least a 1MB download speed the games takes 2 hour max to download ,the guys who took days must have a bad bandwidth
9390	0	a	rather play with my own faeces
7956	0	a	This is the absolute WORST FPS I've ever played.... you're reading the introductory text (ie., you don't even know the movement keys yet) and get slaughtered in the spawn area by some APB Troll.... then he thinks he's so funny that he does it another 20 times.  If I paid for this game, I'd be â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. As it is, I'll simply uninstall it and go back to Combat Arms.
6459	0	a	i like it how is in the free to play section
5002	0	a	This game was fun, until you ranked up and fight with all the p2w there is. Unless you are willing to cough the dough, then do not bother playing this.
10127	1	a	alot of fun in both freemium and premium modes. Freebies are limited in crafting ques and exp. Freemiums get crafting skill que unlocked and around 100% exp, There are 3 premiums and the cheapest is survovor for $10 and is well worth it IMHO ;)  One of the few games in a post apocaplypse setting that have detailed char creation right down to tattoos and makeup, good and fun gameplay for both free and premium players. Also level cap is 55 regardless of your free or paid you are not limited like most mmo's to a lower level cap.   Crafting is fun and you can craft yourself a awesome set of gear that is better then anything you can buy unlike WOW or other mmo's where usually you will find better in quests then your crafting allows you to make...
1373	1	a	I personally like being able to customize everything in the game the way that i want, plus i really feel like i am the criminal trying to get away with crimes, and watching out for the cops so they don't catch us
7829	0	a	if you like tutorials that take 3 hours you will love this game
2773	1	a	This is quite possibly one of the worst games I've ever played- No balance and lackluster story make this game more of a chore than entertainment.
1329	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing love it  
5148	0	a	A broke un-fair piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥.......yet i keep going back to it, I don't recommend you get it because it's addicting, and you don't want to get addicted to this â¥â¥â¥â¥, it is extremely pay to win, save yourself the time and go play a decent game guys!
2992	1	a	
6964	0	a	never loads my people
10146	1	a	This game is pretty good but it is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. It is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t because you can download the game for mac on websites but not on steam.
167	1	a	the bestest ^^
4520	0	a	-Spend 20 minutes downloading and installing moar direct x from launcher -error launching, send crash report -spend 10 minutes repairing -launch game -waste 10 mins making fat man -call him Big Badonkadonks -find out you can't select server or press next -cry over loss of badonkadonks
303	1	a	Its a pretty cool game if you look beyond all the technichal issues.
6160	0	a	just buy GTA V  seriously
2610	1	a	Love it!
6963	0	a	the game won't launch despite i already update my Nvidia PhysX to the latest version
8855	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥, i payed for this game, then it just removed online, couldnt play it, it came back as free and is slowly dying. Don't even deserve to be downlaoded
7849	0	a	pay 2 win and terrible community
10491	1	a	A great free to play MMO with an addictive chained quest progression through the first major areas (I've just reached the 'conflict towns' where factions can be chosen). Just riding a horse, or driving a buggy, through the post-apocalyptic wilderness is a strangely relaxing experience! At least until eaten by a sandworm!
2730	1	a	Its all about the wisper OCA man.
6496	0	a	I installed this game as soon it was released as free to play, but the game was pay to win from day one so I eventually stopped, and I'll explain why.  I understand that this game needs pay to win elements in order to recoup costs and generate revenue, but there is a universal line which the company has unfortunately crossed.  Pay to win items in this game include fast cars and premium firearms far deadlier than the stock firearms which otherwise would have taken days to weeks to earn, if at all. Not only that, all weapons are subscriptions that need to be renewed. That is the line that should never be crossed. Pay to win elements should never award any significant advantage over the default elements. If it does, the quality of gameplay is flushed down the toilet and it's not a real game anymore.  In summary, the only way to be good in this game is to buy the deadly premium weapons on which the company has unabashedly placed exorbitant pricing, and apparently most players do so every day. It is the only way to have any amount of fun in this game, unless you enjoy being unfairly DM'ed.  And this is from my experiences a few years ago, which I haven't written about at the time because the review system hadn't existed then, plus I haven't thought of writing one until now. The system hasn't changed, nor will it ever, because why would the company scrap the system that generates probably the majority of their dirty profit? Unless you are willing to spend hundreds of dollars a month on this one game, I strongly suggest looking elsewhere to satisfy your daily cravings of online shooter fun.
3365	1	a	Really well thought out game - a bit pricey if you're looking for items on the marketplace; but understandable due to how the game itself is free and doesn't require you to buy anything for it in order to play without any hassle - ignoring the people who complain about it being a Pay2Win scenario. Buying marketplace items is just for vanity mostly. :)
1460	1	a	Fun and addicting.
4506	0	a	very fun when your not with pay to win noobs. warning this game contains pay to win so be warned every who plays except about 1 % are pay to win noobs if you want to play a game which is fun and isn't ruined by the players then this game is not for you
863	1	a	Pros :   - Its Free!  - Character Customization is pretty good.  - Decent fighting  Cons :  - Its Pay2Win but anybody with common sense will do 'Fine'  - A little buggy.  - The driving Mechanics is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing terrible.  - Kind of un-optimized.  Well that about sums it up about this game its pretty decent and its not what i expected. 7.5/10
3237	1	a	Spent 4 hours Ram Raiding and mugging Got caught by an Enforcer Tried my best to escape Died Watched,how enforcer stole all my money Lost Took a mission Won Got a spray paint as a reward Went ram raiding again Bought a gun for 10 days Took another mission Got rekt by a guy with a Machine Gun Lost Game crashed Could not login for 4 days On 5th day I logged in It said that mine account does not exist 11/10 Would kill myself again
7006	0	a	This game is ludicrously frustrating, but I can't stop playing it.
1802	1	a	I broke into a garage, shot innocent people while running down the street, ran from the cops, and then fell off a building and lost everything. Also I did all this in my underwear.  10/10
5371	0	a	I have never raged as hard before or since playing this game...
2242	1	a	had fun playing
7176	0	a	Got kicked for joining a world
9033	1	a	This game is great! The enemy told me everything I needed to know after forcing him to play this game!
10591	1	a	Thank you deca for bringing new hope for this old game.          (plz fix the nexus key delay and other unforgiving things :P)
1046	1	a	10/10 I don't even know what I'm doing
3999	0	a	Don't believe the people who say that this isn't a pay to win game.  Someone who has played this for about 2-3 years will still fall behind someone who spent $100+ and only months (sometimes weeks) in this game. After logging in almost 500 hours in this game I can say that it does get really repetitive. I gave up around the time hackers ruled the servers. Even with this new system out I'm very hesistant to go back.  Cusomization is nice.. only if you pay for extra slots.  Seriously unless you're the trophy wife or gay secret lover of Bill Gates who will willingly give you lots of money, I don't suggest spending a dime on this.
5264	0	a	Other than the crazy detailed charecter creation, this game doesnt have much. It feels like a generic third person shooter, with generic guns and generic cars. Also it is a sandbox but theres no real free roam just group missions making the game pretty boring.
10381	1	a	This is as badass as it gets. Think of it as Fallout: New Vegas: The MMO, except that you get horses, ATVS, motorcycles, choppers, dune buggies, cars and even a mutant wolf to ride, every gun being craftable and rewarded via PvP and quests, major focus in world pvp aswell as competitive PvP arenas, and oh so much more. I have never seen such a fun to work with, and easy to use crafting system in any other MMO. It is easy to grab the materials you need, level it up, and build the next gun, sword, motorcycle, or armor with. This game will keep you entertained FOREVER. There are no seperate servers, but rather just one big one, so you will always have players at your side and truly have that 'MMO' feel all while not fighting over drops that NPCs give and the such. This is also one of few games that traveling far distances is actually enjoyable in. This game is absolutely HUGE and literally takes hours and hours to cross an entire region. I wish I could write more, but this is just gold.
4824	0	a	Even if this game does get it's â¥â¥â¥â¥ together.     It's still a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥
3214	1	a	great game  
2803	1	a	a lot of lag, but a great game~
1839	1	a	Really fun game, you can play with friends and customize your clothing/Cars.
9868	1	a	I have started playing this game this week and have found it to be a enjoyable one. the game is much like fallout if you liked that game then you would enjoy. the graphics are ok but i find that this gives this game a diffrent feel and in away the fact theat their not amazing has given it a diffrent look and aspect and me personal enjoye this about it as now a days its all about the graphics and this gives a brake from that. thir seems to be a problem with the landscape loading and then doesent buffer as well as not a frecent movement seem to be laggey ( friends have had same problem) but besides that what i have played so far is enjoyable. i would recomend this game to people who enjoy games like fallout.hope you have the same enjoyment i have had and i hope it continuse thought the game for me
3204	1	a	Made my character look as much like me as possible, 5 min. loading screen, entered game.  No matter what you do, your character will look like they've just done heroin 500 times. 10/10 what will you look like on drugs simulator
901	1	a	Love the ple the APB!
2564	1	a	Fun game to play with friends
4559	0	a	i see this game looks like popular and cool BUT, , sad news, i can't play this game . I had downloaded it,updated it,and. . AFTER THE UPDATE , i CAN'T start the game. . the LOADING takes long time . i wait every hours . WHY THE HELL I CAN'T LAUNCH THE GAME ?
2885	1	a	Truly a good game worth trying.  Pros: Customization on almost everything, Clothes, Cars, Your Personal Avatar Cons: It is somewhat pay to win, premium gives advantage over poorer players.
5767	0	a	Dont ever ever play this game it is made only for ppl who pay money,if u just want to get it for free and play it u will get dominated and killed then killed,killed.....
4720	0	a	This game was pretty good I liked the intro to it and the theme was really good, but I didn't like the gory headless horseman event it was pointless and boring. I dowloaded this game because of the cars and fighting, I don't want to carve pumpkins or do any events, it does take time to unlock things on the game so be warned, you will have to have a lot of spare time on your hands. The fighting part and car driving is fun though and the customization options are very wide. It was really fun and enjoyable, although the events were boring.
8274	0	a	Practically the best Pay to Win game ever! If you're broke, you're â¥â¥â¥â¥ed! :D
7255	0	a	Used to play this game back when RTW had it in BETA, Back then it was GREAT! Could of brought something special to the next generation games. But they flopped, and G1 Bought the game, and It has turned into a typical G1 Game.  Cheaters every mission, lack of massive development ( except for the cash shop ) and even a favourtisim from the developers to certain clans, due to them 'knowing' someone in that clan.  Would not recommend playing.  5/10 Because it WAS a good game.
443	1	a	seems like a good game, although I haven't played enough to say. would recommend. 
9248	0	a	I had more fun installing the game than playing it.

3755	0	a	After playing this game for about 3-4 years (and even giving a presentation about it for my highschool english final, kill me inside) I finally got the guts to quit playing it.  This game can be classified as GTA's artistic (no, not autistic) cousin who died off early due to a birth defect but was resurrected by the power of money and a dream that is constantly being battered down by a poor community and a money-hungry company.  I'm not berating this game. The only problems I have with the game is its toxic community (aside from some hand-picked few), the fact you have to pay for everything, and the graphics get worse each year. I still do come back to it to make some friend's custom symbols for when they ask. This game was great for what it was at the time. A F2P multiplayer Grand Theft Auto for the PC in which you can customize just about everything you ever wanted. But for the community and the company that hosts the game? I'd be taping a huge DO NOT CROSS banner on it if you're looking for a game to main. Play this game only if you have a bunch of friends to join in to kill time.  The game is great for what it delivers as a 2008 (or around that?) game. - You can lean around corners and you're allowed a wide-range of weaponry consisting of but not limited to: On-Impact Grenades, Light-weight Snipers, Rocket Launchers, IRL Paid-For Legendary Pistols that do better than any of the F2P rifles in the game (I'm looking at you Nano &lt;3), half a brick, and even snowballs. - The Vehicle system is great allowing you to buy a bunch of epic looking cars that (for real life money) you can modify just like Need For Speed Underground with the body kits, car seats, dump valves, radio waves, and monkeys. - You can run around two different pretty big cityscapes ranging at 1k+ meters and traverse it the way you want by either running around or driving cars (or surfing on em). - It contains one of the best character and car customization systems out there, allowing you to make symbols by the use of manipulating random shapes/vectors and placing them on a vast amount of character clothing and vehicles. - You're also able to change the music people hear when you kill them, music that gets played out your car, and music that you can play in a portable stereo system. (Yes I know, its as epic as it seems) - And you can even chill in the game's social area where you can edit your car, clothes, face, and just hangout with other bros and bro-dettes.  All-in-all if you want a game in which to customize stuff with, this is your game. However you practically have to pay to get everything, otherwise have fun spending thousands of hours trying to unlock everything. Also don't play this game if you get mad really easily, that's my final word on this.
9362	0	a	its...Ehh not realy worth it its just so...generic and it needs to load up for like 40 min every time you play it so just not worth it sorry.
685	1	a	idk for but i like gta5 is better my opinon i will say yes its a good game and i like both gta 5 and apb there good games.
1397	1	a	Amazing game, the only bad thing is it gets board over time.
523	1	a	Play from Australia and it is unbelievably delay for driving a car. It is like max out the driving difficulty. :P But what make this game so good is a extreme customisations that I never ever see before.
2710	1	a	Had tons of fun playing this with The Respectable Gentlemen Crew on Guardian Server. Lots of great times and laughs. 10/10 would play again.
6131	0	a	Pros:  - Very deep character costumzation - Play as police officer or criminal - Nice graphic - PVP battles without inteferences  Cons:  - Pay to win - P2W - Victory for money - Credit Card is a mandatory - Just for people who live with parents
5661	0	a	Downloaded it, clicked on the icon to play, sends me to a website that doesnt even relate to the game. 10\10
380	1	a	I Love Playing this game but the sad part is i dont own any credit cards and i want a weapon that i can have permantly have and not for rent because i hate renting things :P

4280	0	a	I dont write alot of reviews for games like these, but found it necesarry at this point. The game is breathtaking in its world and has a great character customization. The community (atleast for me on the EU servers, im an expat from america) was horrible. The matchmaking paired me up with Gold level players over and over and over and over again. I was getting my a** handed to me 100% of the time i played this game. Even though the game isnt pay to win, you still cant buy a gun forever. You have to renew it every 10 days. Unless you pay real money, you cant really connect to a gun and know you have it forever (which i kinda like when i play shooters, im not adaptable like that with my guns). And the problem with the gold players they match me with 100% of the time on every district is these people have maxed out everything, and put 100 bucks into the game. Besides those points, APB is a great game and I do recommend it if your ready to get your â¥â¥â¥ handed to you for 24 hours and on.
5016	0	a	Started playing since the Reloaded beta. 2008 graphics/game, but you still need a mid-high end pc to run this without it FREEZING, barely new content has been added in +4 years, clothes, cars and re skinned guns, some cry about p2w but i think it is pure skill because (re skinned guns). 'Developers' (they cannot change game's code) are now trying to do tons of events giving players a lot of stuff for them to unlock certain clothes, etc, that's not enough, the game is dying, population is so damn low. The engine upgrade was meant to be released in Q1 2014, but they have only given some â¥â¥â¥â¥ing pictures of the SOCIAL DISTRICT with more foliage and better lighting, not even gameplay. I don't even know how are they thinking of releasing a console version lol. They have to release the engine upgrade or just cancel this 5yr old beta.

4194	0	a	Okay. This is pretty hard for me. I've been playing All Points Bulletin ALOT. I played it back when Realtime Worlds released it. I played it the time where you could leave your character in the 'Car Creator' over night and gain multiple thousand of dollars for doing nothing. Good times!  Back then, it was a fun new idea. Massive Multiplayer Third Person Shooter! It was GTA, but online with friends! Shoot with or against your friends through various locations, get new cars and edit your own music. The character creation and customization is beyond great! Very deep and there are so many different clothing options that all are design-able. Back then the game cost about 50 dollars, and you paid for the time you played. And when you had bought your X number of hours, it only counted the minutes you were in the game. There were plenty of ways to get even more hours, just by playing the game! And you wanted to. Damn, I played the sh*it out of it.  But alas, Realtime Worlds went down in 2010. Along with the game itself. Plenty of gamers from all countries were upset about this. I even logged in on the last day it was online, playing with the admins. Teleporting around and up on tall buildings. It was upsetting, really.  But then in the first half of 2011 All Points Bulletin: Reloaded was launched. And now it was Free-to-Play. It was great! Back was the customization, back was the open city and the cars. And for a time everything was great.  But sooner than later you started feeling the 'Free-to-Play' restrictions. And it pains me, because I enjoyed the game very much in its young years. Now you have to pay to be a 'premium' member. Which basically is what the game was for everyone back in the day. Your design slots are restricted unless you pay, which was on of the big reasons this game was so great. The game is infected with hackers and Pay-to-Win people who empty their credit cards on Armas Marketplace (Which basically is a 'Pay five dollars for the greatest weapon in the game' kind of shop) just to dominate every game. The ranking system, which was created to separate the newbies from the hardcore, is broken and unbalanced. If you go from Bronze to Gold in the same map, you will not be removed until you leave yourself. Most experienced players will just lose on purpose and kill themselves until they rank down to bronze, so they can join the newbies and kick their asses.  And the worst part? I can understand that. Because the Gold ranked servers are so infected with Hackers and 'Pay-to-Winners' that, unless you're willing to use hundreds of dollars, you wont stand a chance against.  Back then, when Realtime ran the show, I would probably have given the game an 8/10. I enjoyed it so much, and it was so different from everything else on the PC at the time.  But now? As I said earlier, the game was GTA with friends. Now we have GTA 5 Online (On PS3/4 and Xbox 360/One. Pc from mid-April), which does everything APB did, but better. I can't look away from the game's HUGE problems. The hackers got to go, and the Armas Marketplace has to be balanced with the weapons you can buy from vendors in-game. How the f*ck are anyone else going to stand a chance? And in general the free-to-play rules don't fit the All Points Bulletin I knew. Though I understand the practice, seen from a company's eyes. ($$$)  If I were to recommend this to anyone, it should be to play around with the games amazing in-depth editor. It's on cars, characters, clothes, tattoos and more. But not much else. Today, it earns a 4/10 from me. Don't play it, unless it is to fool around for a bit.  I play it primarily for nostalgia. Nothing else.
2515	1	a	There aren't enough isocubes for the population.  Mute the game though, or you will feel the need to hand out more agressive justice (and choice of verbage).
414	1	a	Apb Reloaded is one of the Best Games,itÂ´s F2p but it has a BIg Fun Factor if you play it with some Friends or you are in a clan. You can Design the Craziest things if you are a good designer,nothing is Impossible in this Game. Apb Reloaded shows us, you must not pay for a Good Game !
4562	0	a	i played to mutch of this game and i started to hate it after i found out that it was not that i sucked it was the shooting system the game has no head shots or weak points. that showed the reality for pay to win the more you pay for guns with real money the better you are in combat. it's impossible to get good guns for free. and if you get something remotely close to good you are limited to few weeks to own it. you can get free guns that last forever but to get one gun you need to play this for more than 40h and they will still suck (obs. if you see someone with fancy car or cool clothing that you need to fight, you better run). then we are done with guns, now we can go to customization the main thing that the game rubs in your face. Yea it's good but for non members you are limited to specific number of layers on eatch object. the music maker system is pointles couse most music that you can find from community is copies of edm and the samples you get to use sounds like form sega genesis (michael jackson's moon walker Was better than this). the cars just looks like chinese knock off of american and japanese cars. only the little plus isbattle arena wich is bit addictive but will make you angry after finding out the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ wepon system i can't give a good score to this game couse of bad shooting system, good but limited customsation, pay to win system and badly made car models. i give 2/10 (better to download gta sa. with online mod or get gta 5)
6152	0	a	This game is a lot of fun specially with friends sadly this is a pay to win game.
701	1	a	Better than GTA!!!
8581	0	a	Dont waste your time playing this game
10876	1	a	Annoying, yet fun at the same time. When you ragequit after a huge loss, you eventually come back after some time.
5881	0	a	This game honestly seems unplayable to me. I'm sure its a good game, but I can't see for myself because when I go to register theres a little sign/symbol thing in front of what I think is the next step button. I can't even get past the first step because of this. Theres no guides or oher people having this problem. I can't scroll, I can't move the box, just completely stuck. 0/10.
10427	1	a	This game is very good and I played it alot with my brother. the only bad thing is getting a vehicle is hard and the people in chat are not helpful at all. over all I would give this game an 8/10. pretty good game. Check It Out!
10213	1	a	This game was ok, its a pretty decent MMO, the only downside, is the Enemies, they respawn rather quickly, and if your on a quest to get an object thats surrounded by idk 20 enemy NPC's if your not mega-high level to take them down quick (or if you dont have someone with you like that) youll get through half before they start showing up again, and then youll have to deal with all the new NPC's as well.
4377	0	a	Just dont... game's good and had the best open world experience with fantastic customisation but the community trashed it.
4333	0	a	this game sucks â¥â¥â¥, get Stupid â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ XIV or Grab That A$$ 50 instead you â¥â¥â¥â¥ing fajit
10678	1	a	For people thinking about trying this game: If you like RPG's where you can loot up, play with friends and get amazing items as well as drink potions till you max that class and play many classes and rank up on your journeys this is the game for you, but TAKE CAUTION for if you die, you will lose all the items on that character, you can also put items in your vault to keep for future characters. Upgrade pets and teach them to heal you and give you mana, or attack enemies. This is all around one of my most favorite games and I have played over 1,300 hours in under 2 years.
7434	0	a	no its crap and wont let me play it after about 2 hours of â¥â¥â¥â¥ farting around go spend 20 bucks and get gta 1 you will have more fun
5225	0	a	11/10 after 900 Hours punkbuster decides to kick me out everytime when i try to login.  but seriously, they updated their punkbuster so less hackers, P2W ofc. and the game needs to be fixed, if you have 4Gb RAM you cannot play this game it will be laggy. no more F2P items coming, only P2W items example pants what costs 20â¬ irl money. cannot recommend.
10436	1	a	If you are a person who likes big open world games where you can do whatever you want, then I reccomend this game to you. After the little introduction to the game you begin on your journey to do whatever you please, like to become a bandit and steal from people or to be someone who collects medicine to get money and such. I really like this game and can be fun in group play or a little chillax type game. There are some problems with the game and the owners don't seem to update/change much anymore but hey, its a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing free big open world map where you can do whatever the â¥â¥â¥â¥ you want.
2810	1	a	nice but not working plz cantact the server 
7892	0	a	This game is full of ****. They rip you off of all of the money that you pore into this game. I spent some money on it and I never got my G1 credits.
4821	0	a	Shity Shity game becouse I can't download it becouse it say that the desktop is locked
115	1	a	Well, APB is third person. It is free to play. Amazing anti-cheat. Been banned 5 times for some reason. But don't worry, if you get banned, you can Email G1 customer support and they will help you a whole lot. If you have no luck with G1 support, use Punkbuster support. They will help you alot and tell you that you have been banned by Punkbuster services. After 2200 hours, you should have become the best player in your server. If not, then you should invest some of your hard-earned money into the ARMAS Marketplace where you can find weapons exactly the same as the contact weapons. You do not want to get good at this game. Trust me. When you get very skilled at this game, People will begin to hackusate you and you will get reported, and banned. This game is a awesome solid rank of 4.7/10, for its great ability to customize your character and vehicle, and the amazing community. Everybody in the community is so very nice after you beat them in a mission by saying 'Good game', and 'Damn, you scary. I will try harder next time'.

Firstly how am I supposed to know if I like your game unless you let me play it first and secondly are you so insecure about it that you have to beg for likes before you let people see it? Uninstalled, pathetic.
9406	1	a	it looks fun but tell me is it fun cause i dont know 
827	1	a	If you want a game that gives you a raging hardon all the time no matter what, get this game. I should probably get this checked out by my doctor..
8949	0	a	All of my expectations about this game has failed after i played . If you like games like warcraft or fallout ...meh maybe you can play .But if  you were expecting some action based game , this is not what you  are looking for .
5058	0	a	Might be a good game if it actually friggin did something when you clicked start, super awesome.
7416	0	a	This is by far the worst community I've experienced in twenty years of gaming. This game attracts the lowest common denominator of every other game. Beyond the community, it's barely functional and runs horribly even on great machines. The engine update was promised for Q1 2014, yet it still hasn't happened. It can be fun at times, and it is a great idea for a game. However, the execution is extremely poor. I would not recommend this one.
7742	0	a	.....
10728	0	a	Playing for free is basicly a demo.  Gameplay is hard at times but fair. Lag screws you over at times.  BTW I used to play at school using the ROTMG web site rather than using steam.
4094	0	a	&lt; Review by a highest rank/skill elite 'Gold' player with a â¥â¥â¥â¥load of hours wasted on it for the only satisfaction of kicking bully kid's butt. &gt;  WARNING: This game will make you want to see the real world burn and almost every human being die screaming in pain.  CONS: - Bad graphic (Screenshots look better than actual in-game graphic, and YEAH, I mean even with everything set on ULTRA)  - â¥â¥â¥â¥ty optimization: Intel i7 + GTX780 Strix 6GB + 24 fu*kin gigs RAM (pc used mainly as a Graphic WORKSTATION just to be clear) and this is the ONLY game so far that still shows stuttering, drops frames for no reason, etc. We are talking about 90-70 fps driving around and suddendly 30-40 fps with a single explosion on screen! The game graphic is from 2011... (for instance Battlefield 4 at ultra runs smooth lag-free at over 60fps costant framerate on my rig)  - Lag, server lag everywhere  - 99.9% of playerbase is made of bully â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ dumb4ss kids with 'I-Am-God' syndrome  - Weapons are as realistic as toy water guns. But much less fun.   - Customization is useless and boring, after a while you will just forget about it and just play the same missions again and again  - No need to keep adding to this list, just figure out every possible question about things in this game and answer yourself with a convinced 'IT SUCKS'   PROS: - If you're skilled enough you can eventually kill those dumb4ss kids and enjoy their never-ending whining followed by how much they are stronger than you and hear details about how they will own you, your mother/sister and (i don't know who else cause at that point they're in my ignore list already).
9088	1	a	For a free to play game this is worth a look, it has a nice feel about it, and a good starting story, would suit the causal gamer and is quite easy to get ito, controls could use a tidy up, but over all for an 'Alpha' not a bad place to start, pleanty of missions and a good crafting system that is easy to use for noobs Great exprence if you havent played a mmo before, this one is quite forgiving unlike Dayz
9970	1	a	Awesome game! You should try it 
4542	0	a	Worst 'free to play' game ever. Dont you even try playing this piece of poop. It will suck all your money.
9107	1	a	I would recommend this game mainly because of the great crafting systems it has and is more, 'Oh, you want this? well too bad, either go make it your self or have a tech build it for you.' That might scare so people off, but for people like me who love that sort of game then you might anna give this a try. I also see alot of peopel complaining of slow download times and game crashes, i never had the game crash on me at all and got this thing done downloaded and playing in under 30 minutes, which for me is fast. Another thing Fallen earth does that i like is the fact you can either be in 3rd person or 1st, i for one enjoy it in first person, but to each there own i guess.
10019	1	a	The beginning verification and updates were long and so freakin' annoying,but the game is good.
2231	1	a	I hear they are doing an engine overhaul!!!!???
6555	0	a	This game is a poor excuse to get money out of unexpecting customers. The game is very unbalanced, so if you wanna play a good free to play game this is not for you. Only people that pay to play/win will have fun becuase they get too beat down on the people who actually have lives. The core game play and customisation is real fun until you get into a game with people that will kill you instantly. My friend and I have played this game for many hours, yet have never found a match when you can win without paying. this game will constanly make you it's â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ till you give it money.
4433	0	a	I could write a long review explainging in detail its failures and succsesses but i'll be short. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME UNLESS U WANT TO BE â¥â¥â¥â¥ED IN THE BUTT BY HACKERS. Unless you are a hacker yourself then i recommend this game 10/10 hackingsimulator 2014  This game will will put your hacking skills to the limit. can you outhack your oponent? (enter epic battle music of your choice) Also it runs like a giant turd, not even a small turd, the biggest, smelliest, brownest turd you have ever seen in your life. its truly a sight to behold. It doesnt matter how good you get at this game because some asshat will be using the OP pay to win weapons. even worse, when you begin your journey into the city of San Paro you will probably be up against the best players with the most op guns. â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS GAME

9863	0	a	Honestly all I have to say is GamersFirst. Yeah, sure. Those guys are just trying to milk as much money from the Community of die-hard fans as possible before shutting the thing down. Game hasn't gotten ANY attention from the devs except for more micro-transactions.   Here's a micro-Transaction example: You can craft Cars in this game. And there is one really cool car. The fastest one with the biggest trunk and overall no other vehicle in the game is even close to beeing a competition to it. Now, if you want that car, you can craft for ages, hell, crafting the car takes ATLEAST 1 week, not farming the stuff for it, no, I mean the actual process of crafting it takes 1 Week. (Except if you pay real money you can boost it a really big ammount) The other way to get it is just to â¥â¥â¥â¥ing buy it in the shop. Yay.   Also: Player customization. Character creation is â¥â¥â¥â¥ and all characters look ugly as â¥â¥â¥â¥. How do you fix an ugly Character? Awesome Clothing, you are absolutely right sir. Now when you first start the game, you notice the 'Wardrobe' slot in your gear-menu. Except the slots don't seem to work. huh. You have to buy the slots in PACKAGES. Or pay a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ of money (I think it was arround 20 bucks) to get all of them.   And one of my absolute favourites is the endgame PvE: You have to buy an Shop-Item to summon the bosses. Yup. I just said it.   Not everything about the game is bad tho. It feels really rewarding when you build your first Dune buggy for example. I'm pretty sure you won't find any matches nowadays but I really had fun in PvP-Battlegrounds, atleast the Deathmatch one, but its Probably everyone using the exact same build in endgame.  It's for free, so check it out if you really want this to be good, but it's basically dead already.  And also read some other Reviews, everyone who's talking about the Enemy AI; the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Combat system or the boring Quests is absolutely right.
10514	1	a	#MakeThisGameGreatAgain #DecaGames I have played this game too much (just look at those hours wasted xd) but the possiblities of creation are almost unlimited, so I hope DecaGames will save this game (UTs tradable again pls ^^)

5121	0	a	  What I liked about the game: There was nothing enojyable about this game. Apart from the Exit game button.  What I disliked about the game: Horrible graphics poor skin textures even on max settings. The mechanics of driving is not nice at all. The PVP matching is totally unfair for new players. Character animations are not aesthetically pleasing. I could go on, but I won't.  Personally I cannot recomended this game.

7583	0	a	'Kicked from server for exesive team killing'. Why does it have a name if you arent allowed to do it. Should call it boredom relief, maybe team poppin'. Anywho, game is a money trap, if you have money you dont want or like anymore, go ahead and waste it on this game. So many people look like speed hackers equiped with guns that shoot straight and/or long distance.

Not interested.   Would be a cool game if they just went pay to look good but it's just another cashcow. Steer clear.

571	1	a	Really fun for a free game.
1050	1	a	Eh. It's ok I guess.
2400	1	a	...
2863	1	a	Strongly recommend this game.  Possibly the highest customization you'll ever see in a free PC game, ranging from character appearance to car appearance to weapon appearance. Strong and intense gun fights, strategic play, teamwork, open-world, you can have fun when you're not even in a mission, collect items, patterns for your customization, parts for your cars, new guns, make your own theme song for when you kill someone, maybe you want to dazzle them with your impressive skills or maybe just completely annoy someone by using an annoying tone such as the mario death theme or the trololol song. The horizons of this game are only known by your creativity and skill. You want to use a car as a ramp and jump out mid-air and blow your enemies up with a rocket launcher? You got it! You want to stun groups of enemies, arrest them and dance around them while they're left defenseless and waiting for the timer to run out so they can respawn? You got it! You want to joyride? Got it! Want to steal items and cars to make money from them? Got it! Are you a enforcer? You can't steal? Who says you can't? Ram a criminal's car into a store and those items are yours to pick up, unless you want the criminal to put them in his car first and then steal his car with the rest of his stolen items, you can turn them in for cash too, just like they can. Want to host a huge group and muck around in the social district? YOU CAN. Want to voice chat to your team and other people nearby? YOU CAN. You want to tag your customized graffiti on a billboard? YOU CAN. You want statues of yourself? HAVE THEM. Whether you want to be good or bad, or a mix of both, there's something in this game for everyone, except for maybe children and pregnant women, well maybe pregnant women are okay, idk, go into labour and let your kid's first words be 'Hey brudda' ~ Wilson LeBoyce.
7740	0	a	This game isn't really new-user friendly. It handles much like GTA, but guns are unlocked based on your level, and you have to kill people do gain levels. They basically start you out with a stick and everyone else has rocket launchers. It's more fun to play with a friend, especially if you're just starting. Friends are more likely to put up with your learning curve than the community would.
2692	1	a	I like this game alot.
272	1	a	Prety good game desipite some major flaws, like balancing, lag, and servers. Other than that very fun game and highly recomend!
4978	0	a	if you want to get camping police that camp at your objective, get this game  if you want to get owned by a guy that absorbs your whole magazine and insta kills you with 3 or 4 bullets, get this game  if u want to suffer failing missions because of camping policemen, get this game  4/10, too many camping pigs  all serious though i love the idea of being a criminal or a cop and doing missions while being able to customise your person or vehicles in many different ways but you will have an extremely difficult time playing, exspecially if your a criminal as you will get policemen that are like 30 or more levels above you camping at the objective and ruining your day. at random times a special weapon will appear and who ever has it when the timer runs out then they get it. normally the weapon makes them unkillable like one time where a grenade launcher spawned and while he was busy firing at the enemies infront of him i sneaked up behind him and fired a whole clip into his head before having him turning at the speed of light and blowing me to bits. when you are doing missions (mainly if your playing as a criminal) you will get to the very last objecitve and just when u reach it 3 policemen will just join the mission and pretty much make the mission impossible to complete. if this game was more balanced and didn't have people who are complete bullet sponges then i wouldn't of have uninstalled this game. overall i would recommend u get this game if you want to play as a policeman but if you want to be a law breaking criminal mastermind then u got no chance.
9491	1	a	if you like poop games this is 4 u

1713	1	a	Fun game, if GTA and SR3 had babys, this would be the baby.
7937	0	a	Crashed in the first five seconds. 10/10
1225	1	a	I do recommend this game, but under certain conditions.   For starters, you can not play this if you take gaming seriously. There is no matchmaking in this game at all. They claim that matchmaking is done by your ranking in the game, however their ranking system is complete and total crap. I made a new character earlier, to test this. With my BRAND NEW character, I did ONE mission. On this mission, I got one kill, and died around 7 times. (Behold, pay to win aspects, will detail later). After the mission was over, I was rocketed from bronze one, to silver 3. I skipped ALL the bronze ranks because of ONE kill.   Now maybe, you'd think, they would at least make the game fair to free players. Not everyone has money they can spend, right? How about, instead, they market their microtransactions to give you game breaking advantages that allow you to dominate every player who doesnt have them. If you get matched up against a pay-to-win player, as a free player, you can reserve your cemetary plot now, because you wont stand a chance.   'But Akalron, they have to make money right?' Yes, of course a company needs a way of generating revenue, but ruining a free players experience is not a proper way to do that. I have played FTP games where the company did just fine by selling cosmetics, not advantages. APB COULD have easily done this, but they took a less retroactive approach to it. Granted they probably generate more revenue this way because of all the players who desire a win that bad.  Heres my favorite part however. I can deal with the pay-to-win, I can deal with the bad matchmaking, but what I can't begin to fathom is their lack of optimization. This game has been out for years, and yet it still runs like its in pre-alpha development. Textures load slower than a snail, the game constantly freezes up (usually in the middle of driving or a fire-fight. Hope you didnt want to avoid hitting a wall or dying.) The loading times are atrocious. The only thing slower than how slow the textures load is how long the game takes to actually open.   My computer is no potato, I have no problems running any of the other 150+ games I have, but when this game sits there loading the district select screen for over 5 minutes? What on earth is this? Are they so focused on adding more over-powered guns for their revenue that they dont care about optimizing performance? Or are they just banking on computer hardware advancing faster than their games requirements?   I do have some positive things to say about the game however.   I have a blast playing this game. It is fun after it finally loads. Its a fantastic blend of GTA and Saints Row. It has a lot of (unlockable) customization, but also takes its gameplay moderately seriously. If you go in expecting to have fun, not expecting to win, you will enjoy yourself.   I recommend playing with friends, because if you do decide to do missions, being able to communicate will assist in winning even against pay-to-win players.  Steal a van, hop in with all your friends, vibe out to the ingame radio and gun down pedestrians like a boss. Enjoy yourself.  And for you developers who may or may not read this review: For the love of god, please fix your game, its too much fun to watch it slowly die off. I've worked for a game with a similar market strategy, and lets just say, they didnt do well. Take that as you will.
4228	0	a	Came back to this game for the third time and its still the only game i most disrecommend , hey devs how about you use this game to wipe your asses when you finish polishing it which is never going to happen.
5559	0	a	ok game but even one pay for guns kill me in sec
4223	0	a	Anti-cheat banned me for no reason. Worst game ever...
10149	1	a	this game first was a good game with some brilliant concepts now it has matured into a fantastic game with a lot of deapth and good multiplay. A real classic for its type and free to play a must have in the goodies cupboard
7475	0	a	awkward car controls, heavy system requirements, high ping.... seriously, stay away from this game unless you want to waste time ==
9909	1	a	I recomend this game if ur interest in a mmo tps or fps zombie game thats open world.
7873	0	a	Go and â¥â¥â¥â¥ your self with the nvidia phisyx
7052	0	a	Three words, pay to win. If it was a non f2p MABY it would be good. 'team game' BULL â¥â¥â¥â¥ nothing about this game is team oriented, whether its the server lag â¥â¥â¥â¥ing over every one or if it is players being â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ I cannot say but either way its not wortha any investment time or otherwise. -7581/10
8587	0	a	Sadly I have to change my good review into a bad one. Once I defended this game, now I have to agree with every single person who says 'APB is â¥â¥â¥â¥!' it is impossible to defend this anymore.  So to add a little context here, I started APB on christmas of 2011 having just upgraded my PC, and I loved it. I would roll with friends taking down crims and enjoying the great sort of arcade feel to the combat and overall play of the game. I took breaks every now and again but I started to play more and more, sometimes playing nothing but APB all day. Come 2014 and I started to see and feel the problems with this game, the player base was dropping, more glitches were arising, stupid balance changes making some weapons boring or bad to use and no new content was being released.  2 years later here I am, trying to find a similar game to APB (in terms of how it plays) to replace it because APB is just not fun anymore. I still hop on it for a short time occasionally but that is mostly filled with frustration rather than fun. APB is a prime example of what happens to games when there are no other games to compete against. APB is pretty much a one of a kind, so the devs can get away with being idiots and people will still play.  By all means, try APB is you want, but do not expect much out of it.  TL;DR: APB used to be a fantastic game, now the devs have made it not fun.
442	1	a	Cool Game !
308	1	a	PRO:  -Customization like u never seen before for you char, vehicles, songs, etc...  -Not p2w: after 2k hours on it i can say u that is not p2w at all... Everything u can buy from the shop is just for incrase ur appearence. All the weapons from armas are a re-skin from the ones u can buy from NPCs wich means that the weapons from shop are just a re skinned from the 'free ones'.  -NO CHEATERS: the cheaters are very rare and they are always low levels becouse they get banned within 2 days. When u meet a player lvl 100+ that is kicking ur â¥â¥â¥, it just means you are playing against a skilled guy.  -SKILL: everything that you require to kick asses in this game is SKILL wich is something that the shop can't sell. When u get skills and u start kicking â¥â¥â¥ u will feel the fun.  CONS  -PLAYERS: some skilled players that get tired of being kicked in the butt by even more skilled players than them, they decide to join newbies server just becouse they feel sad so they want to kick someone's â¥â¥â¥ just as their was.  -ADMINS: WHERE THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ ARE THE ADMINS IN THIS GAME ? i wish that i see some admins that travel trought servers just for making people calm down and stop the rage and flame in the chat. When and admin join a server (very rare) every player get exited and act like the admin is a 'god'.  -LANGUAGE: racism, cyber bullying, rage, etc... Sometimes that happens to being flamed or just to read very bad words in the server chat... in many languages...   BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY IT IS A BEAUTIFUL GAME THAT NOBODY WANTS TO TAKE CARE OF... I WOULD CHANGE MANY STUFF IN THIS GAME, BUT I'M A PLAYER AND NOBODY GIVES A â¥â¥â¥â¥ ABOUT MY WORDS.  SOMETIMES U WOULD LOVE THIS GAME FOR THE FEELING IT GIVES WHEN U KICK PEOPLE'S â¥â¥â¥... BUT SOMETIMES IT GIVES U A VERY HARD TIME WHEN PEOPLE KICK YOURS.
8126	0	a	Classic game. But you don't want to put any money on it.
5427	0	a	Was better on Real Time Worlds back in 2009 it wasnt pay2win back than too
8365	0	a	The game is so ugly!! How to hack my pc can't get on low damn 30 fps! That FPS drops and lagg!!  To start the game! That is during like 88 hour!! Pay To Play game!!! A lot of bullcrap!! Why are there womans in the game!!! Everybody knows they are smaller en harder to hit in fights!! Cutscnene's, crap!! Loadings screen also â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ie girls! People thinking I am watching porn...
2857	1	a	Very good mmo game.Sometimes the servers are not so good but it is nice.
2204	1	a	This is such a great game. It's basically Grand Theft Auto but you're playing with and also against other people online. It is funny and very entertaining. The graphics are amazing and you need a really good computer. But, best of all, it's FREE. Download it, trust me.
10201	0	a	help me i tried to create an account to play this game but it keeps on saying sorry an error occured pls help me i wanna really play this game psl
4299	0	a	This game is absolutley â¥â¥â¥â¥ing horrible.

7995	0	a	If you don't spend money you wont have a chance
8988	1	a	I certainly like the idea of a fallout like theme where everything is destroyed and so what humans remain alive have created forts and live off what remains of the old world. It's customization is certainly a nice feature. The fact that you can get ' Mounts ' or vehicles is certainly a awesome touch but with the size of the actual map it's clear to see why they are in this.   Since it is free to play there is no harm in giving this ago. I've spent meant hours in game and I do enjoy it and would reccommend it to other's.
1885	1	a	Be who you can't be.
10288	1	a	My friend found this game just scrolling through the Free to Play games one day and I am so glad he did. I probably would've never seen it if he wasn't just looking. This game is amazing! I love Fallout and this game has many themes that feel just like Fallout does, and it adds multiplayer to the game. Just got it last night and we played for 8 hours straight! amazing game!
332	1	a	BEST GAME EVER! love it love it love it! both customization, fighting. everything

5978	0	a	First to start off I played 14 hours of this game and let me tell you IT ISNT FOR EVERYONE! The game has a weird learning curve but anyone who is good can beat p2w players. The game in my opinion is not recommended for the casual gamer of for someone who can buy gta 5 seriously this game is awful its just a game that I wish the devs got hernias.
1653	1	a	this is, well play it yourself and see...
5313	0	a	Meh. It's okay at best.
6122	0	a	THE WORST GAME EVER  Wait... THIS ISN'T EVEN A GAME... WHEN I TRY TO LOAD IT IT JUST SHOWS A BLACK SCREEN, THE DEVELOPERS DON'T EVEN GIVE A CARING IN THE WORLD JUST TO FIX THE GLITCH  SHOULD SAY : NOT COMPATIBLE WITH ANY WINDOWS VERSION... ONLY MAC
5408	0	a	Gunplay is clunky 500trillion% p2w gets boring after 0.25 seconds This game made me chop my balls off and kms 10/10 
8788	0	a	Okay I heard this a pretty good game but I cant play it because i figured i needed to download a â¥â¥â¥â¥ ton of stuff fit=rst then it cant play on windows 10 if they can fix I'll recommend it but for now no stars
6443	0	a	anytime golds and fakes silvers in bronze district.
1221	1	a	I rate it 12/10, why you wonder?  Man, that feeling when you â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ grind money for a car and you see one troll that wants to enter in it and he can't, I was very satisfied, until a freaking R250 cop comes and 1v5 us like we were some training dolls.   I repeat 12/10   Best story ever. I loved this game until I played it. :D
10048	1	a	This Game is AWESOME
10071	1	a	Fallen earth is a exremelly good tps/fps game that is sort of post-apocalptic (excuse bad spelling). i dont really know/remember the main objetive. but you are a clone that is needing to change part of this world due to an apocalypse.
3906	0	a	This is a review of APB Reloaded  Or atleast it would be if i could actually get on the game... I keep getting an error saying my physx has a problem of some sort ive tried the suggestions and this still does not work i regret wasting 30 minutes of my life on this trying to get it on the actual game instead of trying to sort out launcher problems. I only downloaded this game to prove to my friend that I would not like it at all and by the looks of the dlc it seems to be more expensive than other triple A titles what look more pleasing, fun and have probably got better gameplay overall, however for now and forever this will be my personal opinion on this game, and anyone whos having this problem then please please please dont waste 30 mins of your precious time.  The DLC is worth Â£107 overall wtf!?
3618	1	a	Very fun game, sometimes the premiums and hackers can be asses, but all in all it's a recommendable game for friends to play ^^
10627	0	a	This game, oh god this game. RotMG was fun when TIGsource was the lead dev but now Kabam now owns RotMG and they ****** up. Kabam made this game from actual fun to pay-to-pay. There is permadeath so all of your levels, items and cool skins you got are gone ad you have to restart again. you can pretty much BUY all of your gear making all of your stuff have no value at all. And to top all of this off you can't even play right now because LOGIC i give this game 1.0000000000001/10
3225	1	a	Awesome game, free version of GTA? probably.. yes sometimes you might get mad at this game but think again, at least your playing something. 
1187	1	a	this game siad that i cant play becuse d3dx9_43.dll
2083	1	a	Hack ur azz off AKA APB! Good game to fuel the rage!
4960	0	a	Basic rundown of APB mechanics:  Miners (known as 'Criminals' in-game) run out and 'mine' stores for ore, or 'mine' civilian NPCs for ore. Then they load their load of loot into a car - which they pick up GTA style usually - to drive it to the shopkeeper to sell each individual peice.  Police (known as 'Enforcers' in-game) run around attacking miners whenever they manage to lay eyes on a miner when they do any of the above. Police can start a battle against miners and kill them to take all of their loot.   The miner faction is unable to attack police unless police start attacking first. This setup lends the power 100% to police. Police typically [always] just don't start the battle if they don't see a win from it. This usually tends to mean the police will have a severe advantage over the miners if they attack; a group of three or more against a single miner, outrageous weapons comparitibly, or outlevel the miner immensely. Almost always by the time the miner knows they're under attack they're already half dead (or less than a second form being run over) and haven't a chance to make up for the poor head start.   Ironically it feels like they gave the mechanics to the wrong factions. Enforcers are usually the antagonists and Criminals are usually the innocents in this game. It doesn't help that the situation causes most Enforcer players to get very cocky and the Criminal players to get very defensive.  The server is unstable. It crashes constantly; which sucks mostly because it takes about 15 minutes to load the game completely and it can last as little as 10 minutes before another crash.  The community is FULL of confirmed hackers on both sides. If you go into higher ranked areas you'll be tracked through walls and hit with aimbots. Lower level PvP is fun, but don't attempt to play to be the high rank. While there are no doubt some legitimately skilled players there are far more hackers. As far as I can tell hackers don't even get banned for hacking.   Final verdict:  The game is alot of fun. Sadly its mechanics imbalanced and it's full of hackers. The Enforcer faction is also highly antagonistic (albiet due to understandable environmental and psychological circumstances). I'd recommend anyone that still has any desire to play to avoid going Criminal faction. It sounds fun and cool when you hear about it but you can't do anything but be killed and robbed.
10788	1	a	10/10 Would ruin life again.
8783	0	a	It might say I only have 50 hours, but I mostly played without steam on another account. I played atleast 600 hours of APB in total.  Whatever you do, don't play this game. It's trash, such pay to win. The legendary weapons are way too overpowered and expensive, all the free weapons hardly match up and even if they do, they have been buffed with modifications which p2w weapons already have those. Gamers First doesn't fix any bugs in APB, this is the buggiest multiplayer game I have ever seen. They can't even fix the fighting club bug where it reverts your progress when you reach the gold place.  I kept saying to myself : - This game will get fixed one day, it will become even better.  I was wrong. I actually spent some cash on this game just to get banned 3 months later for.... for.... nothing. My account got a random block out of the blue. I wrote a ticket only to be greeted by a bot which simply stated that my account was banned for 3rd party application use. DOES â¥â¥â¥â¥ING SKYPE COUNT??! NO? THEN HOW IN THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ I GOT A PERMA BAN? I am not the first one to be banned for absolutely nothing.   The worst part is that I lost the weapon I bought for over 40$...  The game it self has a great concept, but the company only wants money. Don't even get me started on the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t events they do...  Overall, I don't recommend this game for : Poor customer service, in-game p2w shop, sloopy events, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ server/game maintenance, unfair bans.
4143	0	a	APB Reloaded has the worst community I have ever seen in a game. The game must have an assclown magnet coded in to it. Decent game, ****ty people, not worth the hassle.
6829	0	a	i thought it would be fun, but when i get a gun with the money you can get ingame easy and take all of it to own a gun that i can keep for 1 week but to keep it for good i have to pay real money thats just bad. the customization is decent but you need a membership thing. the openworld is horrible, theres no penalty for killing people like a cop chase or even getting money for killing people. the map is full of nothing, and playing as a cop is the same as playing as a crook, you can rob random civs for money and everyone avoids everyone exept the people who pay real money for better guns and cars, they just pick on you until you quit. save your time and dont put this in your library
6871	0	a	Many years have passed since I played the Closed Beta version of APB. Then I played the full version, released by EA. It was a good game, a fun game. I played with my good friends. We had a great time playing as enforcers, hunting down bandits. The whole concept of this ambitious game was brilliant. There was a lot of guns, cars and customization items. Sure, you didn't get everything from the start. You had to earn money to buy better equipement and other stuff. But it wasn't painfully hard. Now, when this game is Free To Play it suddenly became game only for rich kids. If you want to play this game for free, just forget about it. There is no fun for you there. I hate it when a decent game is dgraded to a 'free' to play crap like this.
1205	1	a	Very fun
3897	0	a	This game is ok, I still would not reccomend it unless you have a group of friends to play with. Dont expect to have things like in the pictures unless you spend the time and design the patterns on your own or are willing to pay for it.
7471	0	a	Game is okay.... And that's being generous. That being said, the worst part of APB Reloaded is that it's pretty much pay-to-win. That is, a supposedly free-to-play game having players pay real money to get the most out of the game.
10043	1	a	Fallen Earth.  One of my favorite mmorpg's out there.  One of the better things is does is it's crafting system.  Everything you own,you can craft. Of course you can still buy it, but it is still pretty awesome.   The gameplay is somewhat okay, it feels like a normal mmorpg in the gameplay.  The world is HUGE, compared to other free2play mmorpg's i have played in a while.  There are no real class, so you can create your own playstyle from a good bunch of skills and traits.    Now i know alot of people say this is a 'Fallout Clone/copy'. Which is far from it, the game is nothing  like Fallout except that you can both have first and third person. And that it is a rpg in a apocalypse world.  So my advice is to try it out before you judge it, because hey it's free2play.
1967	1	a	10 out of 10
7115	0	a	Get GTA V and â¥â¥â¥â¥ on it while tearing it to shreads. Then you have APB Reloaded. GTA V online is for you if you want to do it. 60 USD, but MUCH MORE FUN AS WELL AS FREE UPDATES.
6346	0	a	Oh dear god... this game.  It's so bad I can barely keep looking at it for even 10 seconds.  It's gameplay is terrible, graphics don't even bloody stand out, and the economy is TOO DAMN EXPENSIVE.  I can buy a HAUNTED HAT FOR A SIMPLE 1 DAY T-SHIRT.  Come with me, Haunted Hat, this game is 2shiz4me

9080	1	a	i reley dont wan to say this, but i have to now. this game is so esey. i mean, all you do is hit the spacebar. thats it! how is this an RPG anyway? you cant contrail anything but what it says on the screen! what if i didnt want to buy the potion? what apout quests? all you can upgrade is stranth? there is no way you can lose to the boss at the end! this game is crap! its not even an RPG at all! i mean look at it! in what way is this supposed to be an RPG if you can do quests and stuff? all you do is press one butten the entier time! explain to me! the athore coments al totol lies! is it supposed to be stick dudes? i dont even know how this damn game got the daily 3rd prize, or a rating of 4.26! pepole think this review is worthles. go ahead! say it! i dont care! im just trying to make a point here! blam this piece of crap!!!!  P.S the only reson im giving this a 1 is beacuase the voices where pretty good. but thats it!
9468	1	a	its fun when u have a friend to play with
7969	0	a	The game michanics could be tweeked and the graphics could be better but it seems like a big pay to win.
7470	0	a	getting â¥â¥â¥â¥ed by punkbuster so for i hate the game , waste of my time not GOOD
76	1	a	Still one of the best shooter MMOs on the net. What I personally keep in mind when thinking of APB is the most unfriendly community someone can imagine. If you have a good run, they call you a hacker, if you have a bad run, you're called a 'r3t4rd': Laugh or Leave! ;)
248	1	a	110 hours of dump truck driving.
954	1	a	This is an amazing game i love it a lot far too long did i spend enjoying the caombat. Besides the occasional sniper that can 2 shot or 1 shot you most guns are balanced. sadly a lot of the guns are pay to win but im saying you still cant outplay them or beat them
3033	1	a	despite what people think about this game, i think its alright. one thing that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ me off though is that, i was making a design for a shirt, and it was pretty intracate, took me a few hours. then after all that hard work, i came to find that there were only 3 slots for items that you could add. yea. i was raging inside, but ya know, just gotta accept it. pisses me off how they do that, but want the money any way they can get it. i dont know, i was thinking of buying some in game stuff for it, but the way it did that to me, makes me feel kinda iffy.
6455	0	a	Here's my recommendation: that you AVOID this game, and REFUSE to pay any money towards the publishers: G1. The customization is great (well, what was left to GamersFirst by the original creators: Realtime Worlds, RIP), and the driving is funny in a Gmod-physics kind of way, but the combat is utterly deploreable. Biased towards the criminal faction, and favorable to those suckered into paying a monthly fee of around $9, this game is what gives 'Free to Play' a bad name. And as if that premium membership bonus (between x3 and x4 cash rewards for missions/activities, and faster leveling for unlocks) wasn't bad enough, but their marketplace sells items that, once bought, are not customizable, and many are exclusive to the real-money market. Seriously, a gun that looks like an AR but has the EXACT same secifications and performance as the in-game rentable AK costs $40. It's a $40 reskin. Marx isn't turning in his grave, he's weeping and saying 'I told you so!'
1114	1	a	It kills you from the inside
9605	0	a	Not much to say. Buggy, boring. Played with a friend for about two hours before we gave it up.   All in all I'd say this picture sums up the best part of the game:  {LINK REMOVED}  http://tinyurl.com/p5wj2jb   I want my two hours back. (Link is to t i n y u r l . c o m)
360	1	a	Dump trucks, just get one and drive them into things, it's like the main point of this game. JUST DO IT.
10662	1	a	good for laggy and non laggy pcs 
10223	1	a	Wow. Very cool game. Kind of rough and crude, but honestly feels like Fallout 1 in FPS.
9907	1	a	Though it felt a bit dated even when it was released, Fallen earth is still a interesting and fun game. Can be a bit complicated but still fun.
9710	0	a	I played it. Got renamed to a ridiculous name because my name offended the you know who. Then the same mod who had renamed me popped up in main chat to ask people to keep the discussion to game related Q&amp;A. I wasnt even chatting at the time, and the people who were were simply chit chatting. Apparently this is too much for this concentration camp of a game. No fun allowed. Only talk about the game.  I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hate this â¥â¥â¥â¥. Burn down every game company that manages its users like stupid cattle. God forbid giving personal details or talking about fun stuff. It might create you know, DISCUSSION. We dont want that. We want stupid morons who only talk about the game and pay their dues. Die. Eat it and die.
8715	0	a	I'll be honest, it was very fun at first. The physics for cars, looting, riding aroudn with a friend able to shoot at the cops in the passenger seat... playing your own music in the car(that no one else can hear but you apparently). It has good customization, a bit pricey for good stuff but managable... guns and etc aren't pay 2 win to my knowledge but overall this game was a handful. It's buggy, load screens are rediculously long, there's hardly anyone ever on, the policemen side has WAY too much power in their hands to stop the criminals. Hell, accidentally bumping into something with your car gives you a split second of warning that you could be captured and disabled by a policeman... lucky me, once a policeman sees you... They just stalk you to the ends of the earth(sounds realistic lol) because there's no one else online. The pvp got to bed fun but it overall felt like the game was too dead, too unbalanced, and buggy as hell. This is a potentially nice game but it's just another one of those 'never heard of it' mmo's that vanishes off to the side. I enjoyed the little time I played it, but I can't say it was the best experience for me to recommend to another person.
1972	1	a	For a game that pisses me off and I get called a hacker for using a sniper that has the capability to kill someone through a slight corner with a well aimed shot, I like it. The customization, the weapons, and the cars are great, but being able to gun down an enemy just feels better! I'd have to recommend playing with a team though. Gets lonely lol.
5419	0	a	This is stupid and doesn't work. After downloading the game I clicked 'Play' and it takes me to this pop-up window. I just suspected the game was downloading in that window because there was a loading thing, and when it finished I clicked continue. THEN it takes me to another pop-up saying 'Like us on facebook for free new items!' I finally went to the official site (Which I shouldn't have to, seen as how I downloaded this from Steam) and even their site was useless. DO NOT download this because there is no game to play on this.

1253	1	a	APB Reloaded Is A Game Full Of Violence And Crime. Which Means Good, It's Like Playing Grand Theft Auto 5 But More Violence And The Guns Are Really Cool. You Can Edit Cars And Costumize Your Character..... I Give This Game A Thumbs Up! After Playing It, It's Really Good, A Lot Of Users Killing Each Others. Enforces Vs. Criminals. Two Standards! The Standard Of Crime And The Standard Of Justice.  I Really, Really Like This Game! I Recommend This Game For You Guys, So Many Guns And ACTION!
1964	1	a	Boring as â¥â¥â¥â¥ when alone. Fun as â¥â¥â¥â¥ with a friend. Customazation of charecter is unlimited oppertunities. 99% of everything is earned. not much pay-to-wins. +supports nicolas cage 9.4/10
8888	0	a	Dig the game, but the shortcomings are a bit too many. The crafting system gets to be a bit unbalanced, and the length of time it takes to make things, can frankly put folks with jobs and real life responsibilities, off. Add in a slew of cash shop items that give you insane advantages, and you can begin to see the problem. This feels less like fallout, and more like a generic mmo with cash shop.
9582	0	a	I was all like, 'Woah, an apocalyptic game.'  Then I joined the game and was like, 'Woah, and apocraplyptic game.'  -6/10

759	1	a	APB: Reloaded is a game that combines 3rd person over-the-shoulder shooting within a sprawling MMO world that is always changing. After a rough start with RTW (being a retail game with monthly subscription) it was closed and sooner or later picked up by K2 Networks. Formerly known as GamersFirst; K2 Networks set out to turn APB into the 'Free2Play' game it is today, complete with a Cash Shop *ridiculous prices.* Overall a decent game. The customization will keep you busy for hours. The balancing could use a little work and the server is straight up horrible at times. 'Hackusations' are common in every other match. Although actual hackers play, it's not as common as the game-chat would have you believe. Some people will tell you it's pay2win. I disagree. Get a friend, and use a mic! APB:R gets repetitive from the few game modes they give you (just in a different location). Defend this. Attack that. Shoot this. Repeat. I'd recommend this game to a group of friends looking to spend time on a fast paced game and don't mind getting their a** beat from balancing issues.
4436	0	a	Matchmaking does not exist.  30 min in i started fighting gold rank people. Pay2Win (inbefore: OMEGED ITS NOT PAY2WIN LIRN TO PLAY). All gold rank people play in bronze/silver rank servers (gold rank servers are EMPTY, wonder where they all are hmmm, oh right).  You will be sniped from every corner possibe. Mission objectives will be taken on rooftops with 1 entrance where you will get rekt all the time trying to get up there. Much more can be added. I simply won't waste my time. Don't believe me? then proceed.
4555	0	a	This game had potential,till i found it was pay2win. I would rather play TF2.
1435	1	a	fun with friends
10682	1	a	Its a good game, but one problem, unmoderated chat, theres a TON of spam. You have to buy gold, and its exetremely hard to get to live long enough to get decent gear
2481	1	a	It has major freezing problems
8247	0	a	It used to be an amazing game with great potential, but G1 sunk it down year after year &amp; without any improvement at all, sinking the game further down while releasing new armas content (real life money) reskin weapons only nothing new at all, nothing new for F2P, just P2P content all the way &amp; no promises they make are being kept on improving anything at all...  If you're new to this game i STRONGLY recommend you to stay as far away as you can, if you're thinking of coming back to the game again just look the other way... if you never raged before in your life this game will make you rage everywhere if you play it.
7251	0	a	Spent 26 or so hours on the game, So.. Have enough room to talk. The game? Good. The servers? unplayable. If you're not lagging all over the place , Players don't even go into their own districts. Yes, their is districts. I'm threat level silver, But, If I go into silver district, theirs gold threat everywhere, and if you go into ANY lobby with them on the other team? Have fun dieng 40 times &amp; losing. Their is no way to beat them, as they have better weapons, armor, cars, etc.. Which, forces people into lower districts, meaning silver threat go to bronze, and.. as you can already tell, that creates 2 more problems. 1: pretty much the same thing, bronze can't kill silver. And, You get raged at if you are, silver.   So.. I give this game 3/10. Will play it, But NEVER recommend it. Nor invite friends to it. The Devs don't seem to do anything about it. And due to server issue/districts , The only time you'll have fun, is when you're killing people at a noticeable level below you. Which.. Gives 0 satisfaction that you're doing.. anything.

4176	0	a	I really want to like this game. Really, I do. But I can't help but feel that it doesn't want me to.  There is so much right with this game; customization, free-roam game play, thirperson shooter, all of which I like, but at the same time, so much wrong. Little has been added to the game in way of permenant additions, since the game has been acquired from realtime worlds. There have been seasonal events, sure, but other than that, not much else. 4 end game contacts a very long time ago, aside from that, the only regular updates are patches, to attempt to fix balance issues and performance issues and the whole lot, and to the infamous armas store (which is the game's premium shop where you can buy many things for real life monies.) I don't really agree with the way the game's premium shop works, and that's another major flaw to this game, for me. The community is just horrible. There is a clear lack of moderation in the chats and it is apparent as people often hold obscene coversations, or just spurt out vulgar comments to other players for no good reason. I'm not sure weather it's that the game attarcts the worst kind of people or rather it just brings out the worst in people, but there is just so much wrong here. Gameplay wise, the game is somewhat hit or miss. There are times where you can sit down and play and have a great time. Other times, not so much. There are alot of unbalanced aspects to gameplay that people will abuse just to gain a win. Weapons aren't at all balanced, there are clear 'good' and 'bad' weapons, which only further drags the game down.  I can go on and on with all the reasons I feel that this game is not worth playing, but in a way, I somewhat do reccomend the game to people. If you have a group of friends, this game may be for you, but to just anyone looking to play by themselves, I would recommend to stay away. I feel that I have fully experienced all this game has to offer me, and no, I do not recommend this game.
9464	1	a	a good game like fallout and borderlands
6403	0	a	Can't even launch
3495	1	a	update: the game is dead. now they're just milking the remaining players as much as they can. still... APB for life.
2531	1	a	I recommend this game because of its free roam worlds and the way you can do things in this game, its just amazing. The only thing that i dont like about this game is that the launcher keeps redownloading everything for the game for me. pretty much what im saying is, fix the launcher or dont have a custom launcher at all. why dont you just launch it from steam? Well other than that the game is absolutley fun!
2533	1	a	ermergerd love this game. only good with a relatively good internet tho.
642	1	a	Very well done for a free to play game. Great for GTA fans wanting multiplayer
6590	0	a	Until they fix the matchmaking in this game and allow new players a chance to progress without having to fight rank 200 gold threat players, this game is a disaster. I applaud the attempts at trying to prevent cheating, but the game is highly out of balance. You will start out with basic equipment and little understanding of the game and immediately face off against the most highly equipped players that know the layouts and have amazing accuracy.   While this game has mass potential and could be a very solid shooter, the people running the game have virtually removed the player base and removed any and all chances of attracting new players to the game threfore giving this game no real evolution. It simply dies off from the start for new players, and older players like myself alike. If one day the matchmaking systems and servers are more balanced, this could be an awsome game but for now, it gets 2 stars out of 5.
10425	0	a	What kind of game has all sounds but random yelling off by default?
9462	1	a	9/10  I actually love this game, although there are frustrating things about it...
2653	1	a	i get to draw â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and other insulting icons on my car to strike extra fear into the enemies
8461	0	a	cant even play â¥â¥â¥â¥ game
3254	1	a	Friend submitted support ticket and it was resolved within 30 mins. That kind of response is amazing enough to outweigh any cons of the game, if there were any.
7493	0	a	Going into APB Reloaded, I expected an alternative to GTA. One that had many traits that made GTA so successful. If you've ever played any of the GTA titles, you know what I mean. Anyways, this game is a very big download, so please, be prepared to wait. Once the game finally launched, you decide which faction you'd like to be apart of. Criminals, or Law Enforcement.   Each is unique in it's own way. The character creation is extremely in-depth, I'll give the game that.   But the main question is, is this game a good alternative to GTA? In my opinion, no. The game takes way to long to load, around 6-10 minutes EVERY time. The story line is hard to understand, and the game is very much Pay-to-win. You can tell within the first 15 minutes of playing the game. The game is NOT newb-friendly. In missions, if you are a low-level it is extremely hard to find a group that wont kick you out. You can't use planes, boats, ships, or anything for that matter. The only thing you can do, is hijack cars.  The ONLY joy I had in this game was hijacking cars, and shot random civilians. Which is one shot, instant kill. No matter what. It takes forever to become wanted by the police, and when you are, a big clash ensumes. Awsome right? Nah. I crashed every time I entered a deathmatch.  Overall: 5/10: Don't get this game.  Sum-up: A very limited, stripped down, version of GTA.
10342	0	a	In comparison to the other MMO's I've had the opportunity to play this one is not as engaging or appealing.  It lacks the visual draw, the voice over acting, the sound effects, the action, etc. after Â½ an hour I decided it wasnât worth the time to develop the toon.   Unlike SWTOR/ SWG/GW/GW2/DDO/NWN/WOT/RIFT this game does not have a draw factor for me and I was looking forward to it after reading the review stating that if you like melancholy open world no pressure to get mission done games this is for you.  Wishing them luck with a re-boot if it comes to that.  
6868	0	a	lel scraped it m8
4684	0	a	omg i hate the part that u need to like them on facebook!
420	1	a	Apb Reloaded can be very similar to the drug industry. The product is addictive, it will ruin your life, drain your money and the makers/developers don't give a rats â¥â¥â¥ about you.
1090	1	a	The biggest most funnest online open world multiplayer out there!
1167	1	a	It's sad how pathetic this game is.
9861	1	a	Really great game, but i fail to understand the negative review..
5933	0	a	Server performance will give you an aneurysm.
6126	0	a	This game is bad optimized and has a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing boring gameplay with 90% pay2win content.      I SPIT ON THIS CRAP
10095	0	a	Bad: The controls are super weird and annoying until you change them, The graphics aren't the best but thats fine, looting is annoying, I also dont understand why we need to see all our skills at the bottom when we can just hit Y (default enteract button) to activate the thing, and you really need to pay attention in the start or else you won't under stand a thing which I really hate  Good: The story isn't bad, everyone is preaty nice, dosn't lag like crazy, and its free.
8754	0	a	I'll be honest as I possibly can be with this review in particular.  The game is tough when you start out (ofcourse, because ALL games do), and when you progress on, it becomes easier. I'll say it again, tough when starting out... easier when you keep playing. The only thing that most people dont realize and should. There are also, positive and nevative things to the game (again, all games do), but to be basic, i'll narrow it down to the exact things that are good and bad about this game.  So, whats good is, theres huge customization on just characters alone, as well as symbols and audio, with its own feel for car physics and mechanics that are actually quite interresting and unique.  What is bad, is nothing of the actual game its self, but the people who play it. I wont lie, the majority of guns are quite difficult to handle, which its not that bad if you think about it, just means you need to try... since you cant win anything by doing nothing. But, the majority of people that tend to play this game on a daily basis, end up ruining it for everyone, including themselves. Stupid, is it not? Sadly, these are all of the ones who end up cheating just because they dont bother to play the game, or just do it because they feel powerful and have no actual lives to do anything but ruin things for everyone.  If you can do just one thing, maybe... just maybe, I can truely recommend this game to anyone. That one thing is: Try, without ruining everything, even for other fellow players who desperately attempt to make a good clean day of APB:Reloaded.

9394	1	a	what an awful game this was
9039	1	a	Yep, you read it, 1879 hours!  Well, I used to like this game because I could grind and talk to friends at the same time, take over territories, and engage in awesome shootouts (PvP) with up to 20 players or more.  I really got the feeling that I was part of a team and that some people were real helpful with noobs (mainly because of the clan aspect). I had a lot of fun playing this and there are a lot of missions and content. In fact, I am still only 33% of the way through completing the achievements, albiet some of them are unobtainable now.  When the devs were active, they would appear in-game all the time to give away items and be helpful. This was great! Sometimes they would use 'god powers' to be invisible and watch us play new areas that just got released, then make private messages 'I see you!'. - HAH That's great! I met a couple devs that would recognize me and start chatting; even added me to their steam friends list. Pretty cool!  The best experience was on Halloween 3 years in a row where the devs would come out and give away treats (bling for your character). The first year, a dev transformed himself into a giant 4 story tall beast and he ATE ME! HAHAHAHahhaa So the next two years I stood in the mass crowd of online players and typed 'Turn into the beast again!' and sure enough he did, and he ate me again, and everyone started clattering their keyboards to respond. SO GREAT!  But yeah,.. it's just a ghost town now... If more people played, the devs would care again, and this game would once again bring me joy (bugs and all).
7316	0	a	I installed this game as soon it was released as free to play, but the game was pay to win from day one so I eventually stopped, and I'll explain why.  I understand that this game needs pay to win elements in order to recoup costs and generate revenue, but there is a universal line which the company has unfortunately crossed.  Pay to win items in this game include fast cars and premium firearms far deadlier than the stock firearms which otherwise would have taken days to weeks to earn, if at all. Not only that, all weapons are subscriptions that need to be renewed. That is the line that should never be crossed. Pay to win elements should never award any significant advantage over the default elements. If it does, the quality of gameplay is flushed down the toilet and it's not a real game anymore.  In summary, the only way to be good in this game is to buy the deadly premium weapons on which the company has unabashedly placed exorbitant pricing, and apparently most players do so every day. It is the only way to have any amount of fun in this game, unless you enjoy being unfairly DM'ed.  And this is from my experiences a few years ago, which I haven't written about at the time because the review system hadn't existed then, plus I haven't thought of writing one until now. The system hasn't changed, nor will it ever, because why would the company scrap the system that generates probably the majority of their dirty profit? Unless you are willing to spend hundreds of dollars a month on this one game, I strongly suggest looking elsewhere to satisfy your daily cravings of online shooter fun.
4239	0	a	Unplayable. Reasoning?  - Quick Mode customizations will not load upon creating a character - Punkbuster kicks you out of your first match while doing the tutorial - Client fails to close and makes the Steam client believe APB is still running even with the game's processes' closed including Punkbuster
916	1	a	This is the WORST game I have ever played. Every single problem you could have with a game, this right here caters to it. It has 20 minuite loading screens, more micro transactions than any game I have EVER seen, and lags to all hell. But it is some of the most amusing 15 minuites you will ever have with friends.
7705	0	a	A typical G1 owned game, full of hackers. Just like Warrock they get a game and â¥â¥â¥â¥ it over just getting the quick cash. They dont care about the players and made it a pay to win game. Having played the old APB this just sucks. Don't waste your time on this game.
5028	0	a	It's like TF2: New players are noobs. If you're not P2P you're a noob - you are a F2P 'scrub'. Weapons are too OP, and fanbase is a pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥. GG
9070	1	a	nice game fun stuff and the good stuffssssss
10527	0	a	Yep It was fun backthen when  Wild-Shadow-Studios Own the game and then kabam token over and ruined the game so now you have to buy everything like (coins, ect)
1120	1	a	  The game is a lot of fun. Yes the objectives are pretty much repeatable, but every time you play the same objective its different expirience, because of the people you play with and against are different. The only thing i hate about this game is the loading time, but it still worth waiting.
3445	1	a	Ain't much worser than GTA online. 3/5
6885	0	a	Down side is, that I can'tlogin becuase of some glitch.
1927	1	a	The games lost its charm, but I still play it! why do i love this game so much?!
3453	1	a	This is one of the most broken, poorly coded, bloated, neglected, newbie-unfriendly MMOs I have ever played, yet I can't seem to pull myself away. It's a mess that somehow still manages to provide hours and hours of ridiculous fun. I consistently neglect the mounting hoard of games in my library to play this game. I therefore do recommend it, although I would caution anyone that wants to get started that the game has a rather steep learning curve. The matchmaking is very hit and miss, which means you will likely get curbstomped for a long time before your feet find the bottom of the pool.  The plusses for this game are its impressive array of customizable options, and the intensity of its firefights, which can, at its best, feel relentless and fast-paced. The negatives are its bloated memory requirements, server lag, the toxicity of the player-base, the repetitiveness of missions. and the lack of administrative support.  In the end, however, if MMO GTA is what you're looking for... well, this isn't exactly up to that, but it's the closest you'll get, and for me, that was worth the time.
2370	1	a	This is a fun but also repetitive and dont play this game if you hate pay to wins

1206	1	a	Nice game! if you like to edit your own character, This game is for you
6028	0	a	.
4853	0	a	Experience starting: 1: Toxic, immature playerbase rife with racial slurs and homophobia. 2: Poor balancing. First mission in the starting zone was put right in against two other players one with a grenade launcher. Not a good first experience. 3: There is no actual tutorial, you have to figure out everything for yourself, which is fine except plenty of things don't make any sense. IE you can't shoot at criminals in the midst of a crime spree unless your in their mission even though the game claims you can 'witness criminal activity with alt' to start a mission against them. Lots of unspoken rules, lots of players will lose their minds if you actually complete mission objectives. 4: Driving feels sloppy. 5: Gunplay feels weak. Headshots apprently don't count, certain weapons have so far been abysmal. Shotguns that can't kill beyond 5 feet, pistols that just can't kill even when you sneak around and initiate. Long time to kill makes the game feel like the shooter gameplay is tacked on. 6: All the guns cost money if you want them for more than ten days apparently. 7: Most of the civillians look identical. You basically have a city apparently populated by janitors and hookers who can't blink. 8: Customization has lots of options.  In all I tried to give it a fair shake but it disappointed me at most every turn. Was expecting a fun cops and robbers game where you could jump right into heists as they occur and create scenarios organically. Instead its basically a giant arena game with junky weapons and obscure rules that aren't explained. This is all covered in a festering morass of immature and rude players.  Didn't spend in the cash shop, I don't mind them in free to play games (gotta make money somehow) but the situation (temporary weapons and cash shop purchases) give me the impression they're trying to get the last drops out of this game before it dies completely.  3/10.
615	1	a	good game not the best but one u can â¥â¥â¥â¥ around on
2011	1	a	This game is fun once you start coming upp in rank
1283	1	a	very, very, very rage inducing. Hackers and lots of them.....Pay 2 Win.....
2506	1	a	Pretty Legit
1669	1	a	Fantasitc game, it's dead now though D;
5710	0	a	Its gay and for â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥es
9216	0	a	i can't believe people still play this !
2969	1	a	You could have a better singleplayer experience from Saints Row (for the similar art and customization) or GTA (for the game type). This game is far from being perfect, and G1 is basically the 4th reich. But it gives me my fill till the HD rerelease of GTA V. But back to the point. APB is awesome, fun gameplay, they just upgraded(?) their anti-cheat and cheaters have been getting kicked like an mma fighter. Graphics are acceptable for how cartoony they are, servers could be better. I get a ridicoulous amount of lag sometimes or none at all other times. Also its not Pay-to-Win, which I love any game that is like that.   tl;dr  Graphics 10/10 Gameplay 9/10 Customization 10/10 Community 5/10 Servers 5/10   Overall 7.5/10
8887	0	a	The updater is beyond broken so good luck even trying to update. or even play.  This should be removed from steam since it's dead and broken beyond repair.
4895	0	a	If you like paying money to boost your ego then this is probably thÃ© best game for you.
4262	0	a	I do not recommend this game for now, that is because its full of aim bots and other stuff. Also the fps drops need to be fixed
10301	1	a	really good
6851	0	a	Accumlated 3.5k hours on this game. It's garbage, dont do it.
10448	1	a	amazing i love it but everytime i go to change the graphics and restart i goes all grey and i cant play
7232	0	a	I played this game thinking it would be like GTA with vigilantes, but it was just a medium sized map, with mission after mission, with no sense of self! I didn't feel like a criminal because they kept telling me that I had to make friends with other gangs, and it's also really hard to distinguish another criminal with an enforcer. Overall, I felt short-changed, even though I got this for free.
9911	1	a	i [played this for a while it was very fun in a fallout 3 kinda way, however if you do not like faction systems or pvp than this is not the game for you. Its like Fallout, Meets Guild Wars, i guees to most accurately describe it.
9139	0	a	DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. I tried to do a mission and it said to make bullets i had the materials but I couldnt craft it.It turns out you have to find teh blue print this quest is one the of the beggining ones.
10281	1	a	i want to play this game but im confused on how to sign in, i made an account to play, can someone please help me on how to sign in.
399	1	a	Fun GTA-like game that you can play with friends.
1687	1	a	this game is aids
6316	0	a	  it is dog s.h.i.t u cant get rid of the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ beard and than u click done then u pick the country u r in then the next button is â¥â¥â¥â¥ blanked out 0/10 will never play agian
9918	1	a	Some of my best gaming memories comes from this game
2387	1	a	Basically GTA: Online but with more general customization and less graphic capability and... the physics are not as good as GTA: Online's.
9250	1	a	Brilliant game and a entertaining MMORPG, my only gripe is where is the Mac version of the game at present its only available on steam for windows?
1995	1	a	its nice and cool &lt;3 the cars and stuff i rate the game 20/17 but its ok 
323	1	a	Amazing game.  This game is like the old version of saints row 2 meets GTA Online and a whole â¥â¥â¥â¥ton of crack (and stealing)
5239	0	a	Banned before playing 10/10 game
1580	1	a	its ok
7129	0	a	Game was awesome, too bad it WAS... That was one of the best 3rd person shooter I have ever played, too bad this game is stucked at beta and its release date - 2011y... I have more than 12000h play off steam, max ranked, having collection of most legendary weapons, I havent payed a single cent for modifications, and im actually feeling good that i didnt putted any of my money into this game, gonna give some reasons... 1st things new players has to know - game is total P2W... If you are not going to pay money on this thing - you will regret starting playing this thing... If you are player that has bigger rank than 100 and you get gold, you gonna get f*cked up by c*nts that either cheat or are P2W, having all the weapons bought from G1M... 2nd thing would be stucking in 2011 year, in whole my huge gameplay experience i had only 1 patch, that added some new weapons, vehicles and some modifications in the game (Yes, Im talking about rising max rank until 255R and adding 2 new characters)... 3rd thing - they started nerfing legendary old school weapons like sitting ducks and ect., making to spend even more money on new legendaries or G1M shop, I totally do not support any of these things... 4th would be server instability, game had great stability until community started asking new anti cheating systems, that totally destroyed stability, and havent helped a bit from cheaters. 5th - unreasonable banning just because some ppl complained that you hack, just because they are better than reporters, thats how i got my 1st account banned - without evidences and stupid reasons... 6th would be hilariously stupid matchmaking and balances - Gold guys are playing in silver servers, silvers play in bronze, and bronze dont have where to run from silvers, the other thing would be about golden players 7th - gold players... If you got gold in game - you can say goodbye to game, because gold is the place where P2W and hackers plays, if you get there, prepare for the worst... I stopped playing this game and dont play it for &gt;1 year now, because i realised G1 cares only the smell of fresh earned dirty money... I totally DO NOT RECOMMEND SPENDING A SINGLE BUCK ON THIS CRAP, SO DEVS WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT THE GOING TO LOSE ALL THE PLAYERS, AND I PERSONALLY HOPE IT WILL HAPPEN 1 DAY! Sorry if my review contain mistakes, nobody is perfect, but the game IS IN TERRIBLE CONDITION. -8/10
8612	0	a	dammit how to download this thing?
5200	0	a	The name of this game should be: Pay to Win Reloaded This game is THE definition of Pay to Win. There's next to no content available for anyone who doesn't want to spend money on this pile of trash. The gameplay is completely unfair when fighting morons who spent money on the game. The driving is terrible, the gameplay is slightly less grindy than Destiny, and the environments are bland and boring. The only thing good about this game is the amount of customization possible. You can put anything you want on nearly anything. Put the N word on your shirt, on your car, on your own body as a tattoo, and around the world as a large spraypainted image. Roleplaying as a member of the KKK has never been so easy.
6519	0	a	Even though I like the setting and the customization options, the connection for me was completly unstable. I kept getting timed out every 10 minutes. Unless it runs better for you, I wouldn't recommend getting it.
4339	0	a	THIS GAME IS JUST CANCER, IF PEOPLE CANT SEE THAT THIS GAME IS PAY 2 WIN THEY CAN KISS SOMEONE SPECIAL. FOR ALL THE NEW GUYS WHO DECIDES TO JOIN THIS GAME BECAUSE IT LOKS LIKE ALOT OF FUN, THINK AGAIN! IF YOU JOIN THIS GAME U HAVE TO BE PREPERED TO WASTE LIKE 100$ TO LIKW EVEN KILL ANOTHER PLAYER WHO HAS EVERYTHING.
4260	0	a	Take GTA V and maybe some other 3rd Person Shooter and this is what you get. But worse. Very worse, since its nowhere near GTA V and you can't mod on this game.
3845	0	a	5/5 Unistall button works
3063	1	a	this game rocks men but there is a problem with the internet conection i dont think is my computer problem who i m must to ask to find uot what is wronk 
5778	0	a	Ya, how about no.
9129	1	a	Nothing says apocalypse like a chick running around in a thong ;D
410	1	a	The community can be a bummer since it is filled with ragers :/  There used to be a lot of hackers but since G1 made a anticheat system there's not many left.  I recommend this game to people who likes Shooter games (But not FPS)
4613	0	a	&gt;account randomly blocked &gt;asks support why i got blocked and if i can get unblocked &gt;''your account is blocked permanently and will not be unblocked, further tickets will be ignored.'' &gt;thats all she wrote  &gt;?????  barf
9628	1	a	is very cool game!!!!!!! BRO!!!!!!!!! 
4298	0	a	I'd review it if we could actually even play it!! The log-in process on this game is awful. My son, who just got his first lcomputer, downloaded it and was feeling jaded so I downloaded it and was doing no better than he was. I mean, have you ever actually gotten a person who knows nothing about the game to give it a test? All I know is that we followed the instructions and the f-ing thing wouldn't work.
238	1	a	It may be a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ some times but when it works it rocks! i love the game because of its beauty and potential. some people see a trash game without any good things in it. i see a unfinished game that can turn into a awesome game! may be kind of a pay to win game but that just means you gotta upgrade yo skillz!
38	1	a	Anyone looking for a new kind of MMO should give APB: Reloaded a download. While the Armas Marketplace offers a wide variety of weapons, vehicles, and aesthetic items be assured that this is a well balanced Free to Play title and requires no purchase for the full experience. Character customization reaches a whole new level with their persona, outfit, vehicle, and symbol editors and the maps themselves are created with great detail.  Though the game can be difficult to learn at first, as the mechanics are quite different from most other open-world shooters, and the Armas Marketplace suffers from the same tragically over-inflated prices that most Free to Play games tend to this is a very solid game with a lot to offer. Action is always guaranteed and with plenty of unlocks and mission types you're sure to find yourself unable to walk away easily.
9843	0	a	if you like pans i recomend u not bplay balogna bcus it if butts
3101	1	a	Best shooter i have ever played
5118	0	a	got banned for no reason spent over $500 irl dollars what a waste
3450	1	a	great game not p2w guns for cash are jsut reskins...Legendary weapons are the only thing that is very Overpowered!
9778	1	a	Great Game played it long before it came on steam.
5321	0	a	Its a pay to win you have to pay for the fun â¥â¥â¥â¥
1142	1	a	Absolute awful excuse for a game. Huge disadvantage set against beginners as max rank players are still able to play against them. AI is simply dreadful and driving any car is a monumental task. 0/10 would deffo not play again
6947	0	a	Hold it! Stop right there, No gamers beyond this point! !!!!!!!!  No use playing: High ranking players stalk the low level distracts and will keep you from getting any actual experience. In short - you're screwed if you're not cheating.  Did I mention it takes a half an hour to load?
8985	1	a	One of the Better F2p games.  It does have some Pay to win aspects in its cash shop, but dont let that detrack from the really Enjoyable game play, Gritty atmosphere, and the best crafting system in any game, All hidden inside this indi gem.  Till Fallout online hits, this is the best post apocolyptic game on the market!  7/10
883	1	a	It's quite the spectacle.
2775	1	a	this â¥â¥â¥â¥ flame â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
3343	1	a	super cool game, awesome gameplay and style. there is a awesome comunnity if you arent good at the game cause if you rek people you hack. but there is a good antihack system in this game so hackers are rare. i can totaly recomand this game, find a clan with teamspeak and you can spend years on this game.
525	1	a	My only qualm with this is the fact that the creators are genius. Their main draw is also their main source of income. Customization. Want to customize your car? Go for it. But you can't have more than X number of decal levels until you have a GOLD ACCOUNT. Want to customize your character? Of course you do, so go absolutely nuts. Right up until you decide to decorate their clothes specifically. GOLD ACCOUNT. How about your spray-tags? Weapons? Anything else? Same restrictions. It's evil genius.
5011	0	a	not as good as it could be, confusing and uninteresting after 3 hours it gets repetative.
5896	0	a	bad game, pay to win and doesnt run well.
8372	0	a	Pay to win.
2639	1	a	really cool game  
10880	0	a	This is a pay to win game.   The best free to play games are the ones that have micro transactions only for cosmetics and dlc's (expansions). any game that does not fall within this type is usually not the best games to play.
8362	0	a	Best Horrible Game so Far ...
8572	0	a	The customization in the game is great, but that is really all i can say well about it..
3798	0	a	PROS -You can create good clothes -You can create good cars -Enjoyable if you can kill people.  CONS -BAD FPS -LAGGY SERVER -PAY 2 WIN -CHEATERS -SLOW LOADING -MACROS -MATCHMAKING NOT FAIR AND ITS TAKING SO MUCH TIME.
8459	0	a	Pay to win
8541	0	a	This is by far the worst community I've experienced in twenty years of gaming. This game attracts the lowest common denominator of every other game. Beyond the community, it's barely functional and runs horribly even on great machines. The engine update was promised for Q1 2014, yet it still hasn't happened. It can be fun at times, and it is a great idea for a game. However, the execution is extremely poor. I would not recommend this one.
1672	1	a	Is Very Gud Game!
6706	0	a	the game just goes off my screen but it says that i am still playing it even though i cany see it.
3278	1	a	Its a pretty awesome game! It's a lot like GTA. Only issue is the steering on the cars... its hard to steer.
8221	0	a	IT'S A TRAP
5151	0	a	This game is garbage and so is Gamers First.
7508	0	a	This game is one of the worst pieces of â¥â¥â¥â¥ i've ever played in my life. I had a LOT of hours into it without the steam version, so I believe I know what i'm talking about. Worst Cop vs Criminal game Of ALL TIME. You start out with the Star 556 and some piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ pistol.Well,i'll inform you now that the gun mechanics are SUPER unrealistic,you can have someone take a BUTT ton on bullets to only turn around and shoot you with thier premium gun Oh?You said premium Yep,Premium. G1 wants you to pay for guns and bundles at RIDICULOUSLY high prices so you can have a advantage over other players. The game loves to do that to people. Match making is pure â¥â¥â¥â¥, running rampant with hackers who have NICE â¥â¥â¥ guns who dominant everyone who moves. It also seems as if Criminals have a advantage over Cops, like they just DO BETTER.  This game is awful. I spent 40$ on it. Never agian. Stay away from it. This game is a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥. 
3936	0	a	As a beginner, I tried to ask for help but sadly in-game if you don't know what you're doing, they trashtalk you, instead of helping, And yeah, this game has a bad community.
270	1	a	This game is great i love it &gt;D
3483	1	a	GTA ONLINO FOR LOW PC! NICE GAME THX
6960	0	a	Crashed in the first five seconds. 10/10
3643	1	a	this game is good and bad. pros- -okay gameplay -ultimate customization -feels immersive  cons- -throws curveballs -no story -rough tutorial -unbalanced -skill based
10801	1	a	  â¥â¥â¥â¥ this Game and i love you Henry &lt;3!  I want to win the contest!
1081	1	a	Now, I bought this game back in 2009. Yes, bought. $50, spent another $10 for 30 days of action district time. I had managed to obtain 6 months worth of action district time by selling Portal themed vehicles in the marketplace for subscription currency (it wasn't illegal, they had actually made a system for it). When this game was revived by GamersFirst, all of us who bought this game retail only got our original characters back as compensation. But... all of our character stats had been wiped. Why am I telling you this? So you'll be surprised to say that, despite being screwed over, this game is still addictive and fun enough to still jump back in and play from square one. Its an exceptionally fun game if you play with a good group of friends or a clan and use voice communication as well. Tactical team gameplay is a must for this game. If you have a coordinated team of players who use excellent gameplay tactics, you will hardly ever lose. A recommended download.
1681	1	a	I put a yes as it isn't too bad a game anymore (used to be very buggy and had insane car lag; since for some reason they're server side). While there are still pay to win elements it doesnt seem as prevelant. If you have a decent computer and some friends it can be plenty of fun.
10204	1	a	do not play it it sucks 
1624	1	a	I dont really like the gun play but is cool and stuff...I think 6/10 penuts
9128	0	a	Lets see, Corrupt Developers/Game Masters, 90% cheaters, this game is high NOT recommended!
2344	1	a	Best game I played tnx for upgrading this game and makeing this game good
9045	1	a	this is a very fun game remindes me of fallout and is sweet for a free to play
2642	1	a	A good MMO to pass the time with....
4126	0	a	Community. Enough said.
5855	0	a	HATE IT wont load and its glitching like crazy ]:
