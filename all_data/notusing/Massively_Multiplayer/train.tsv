727	1	a	It's funny how Gamerslast spelled their name wrong
4030	0	a	Rife with aimbots and pay to win, it's unfortunate that those rather large issues are in the way of what could be an amazing game with all the levels of customization present. The grind is also approximately double what it should be. 500 hours will not even get you half way to the 'good' gear, unless you're subscribed.  There's an ongoing joke that 'GamersFirst' is actually 'MoneyFirst' because of their policies and inaction on issues in favor of monetizing strategies involving power and chance with the store.
9260	0	a	this game sucks mega â¥â¥â¥â¥
2443	1	a	This is the most vile pile crap ever made for pc. Its a virtual sewer if there ever was one. The people in this game are very helpful. And by helpful i mean they will help you  Die and Lose missions by blocking your car or placeing their own vehicle over the drop zone. And great freinds who will kill you as soon as look at you. And of coarse everyone has something nice to say. Usually lots of kind words that happen to have only 4 letters. Any way ... if your head is not in a toilet somewhere go ahead and get this game. its awsome.
5970	0	a	This game WAS worth consider playing, with gta-like elements and Wide range of customizations from clothing to vehicles and death themes and more .....but the pvp matchmaking is terrible AND with the type of weapons the devs allowed has made the type of 'fair game' disappeared. If you want to play this game with a much enjoyable mood then buying certain things from the game is recommended...I play it only if i have no games left to play.
4718	0	a	2 hrs loading .. WTF!!!
2541	1	a	LOTS of fun if u find out how it all works and find a good team of ppl willing to play with u
10243	0	a	During my short time with Fallen Earth, I don't think there was a moment where I wasn't bored. One way of putting it is 'the game has a steep learning curve', but in reality that just means it has â¥â¥â¥â¥ controls and convoluted mechanics elsewhere. Bad, even for an MMO.
10834	1	a	Mad, pestering, addicting and fun. You'll hate it has much as you'll love it.

4560	0	a	This game is absolute garbage. Unless of course you feel like spending your money to have an advantage over everyone...
9185	1	a	The things i liked : 1. crafting 2. survival 3. Massive Multiplayer 4.you can create almost anything ;)  The things i didn't liked :  1. you can have a little money problem in game ... but don't worry you will get some soon :D .    DOWNLOAD NOW!!!! :D and add me if you downloaded this i can help you ;)
10851	1	a	I like this game and played it a lot on Google Chrome. I recently got it on steam and have had a huge reminder of how hard it is to really have fun without making micro transactions! Lots of grinding is needed to advance further in the game but the multiplayer is fun! Its free to play so don't expect anything amazing unless you're willing to pay. Perfect to pass time.   7.5/10
6098	0	a	trash community full of wierdos, nameâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s and weeaboos. pay 2 win system. trash game engine lagging and stuttering with minimal graphics on high-end pc. sessional match system. terrible matchmaking (enjoy your game with 25R bronzes in your team vs 255R golds with communication and p2w guns from clan). 3 separated maps (regions/districts) instead of big one with no borders. frustrating and boring gameplay. the game is no more in development phase means you will never see any new features and gameplay extensions, but only reskins for old weapons. 
2391	1	a	APB Reloaded was honestly one of the best worst games I've ever played, i mean its so good. if you like good games, then you can start by not playing APB reloaded, its the worst game. but you should give it a try.
1714	1	a	One of those games that has so many flaws and so many great things all smooshed up into a clusterfck of addictiveness. After 6 years I hope the engine update brings new life to this mess.
7899	0	a	I played this game just a bit, and I realised that there was no point on installing it. It's unbalanced and boring as hell.

465	1	a	Review written on 07/29/14:  I've been playing APB Reloaded since it was in Open Beta, back around late 2011. Since then, I've logged over 2,000 hours on my main character, who is a max rank gold, AgentRick (Enforcer, Joker East).  APB: Reloaded, like many other games, has it's ups and downs, but it's an extremely unique game that allows you to do so much more than any other game out there.  Let's look at customization first, since this is probably the most significant differentiator that APB: Reloaded has to offer. They have a detailed designer that allows you to make practically anything in-game utilizing tools and presets ranging from basic shapes, to gradients, and even masking tools to allow for cropping of symbols. If you're a premium player, you are able to customize your character and vehicle with unbelievable detail. My clan currently utilizes a Sheriff's Office theme and we have extremely detailed vehicles, uniforms, and logos.  Next, let's have a look at gameplay. The matchmaking system in place may not be the greatest at this current moment, but there is a visible effort on GamersFirst's part to tweak the matchmaking engine, and it's especially evident with the release of the Open Conflict districts. In comparison to Open Beta, the matchmaking system and the balance of mission objectives have come a long way. It's also evident that GamersFirst does focus on working out kinks in the system, as I personally worked with several GMs to eliminate the 'No-Witness-Zone' bug from the Waterfront Districts about a year ago.  Many people complain about the Armas Marketplace, but what they don't understand is that the Armas Marketplace, which allows you to purchase weapons, special clothing, special vehicles, and premium, is APB Reloadad's source of income. I have yet to see or hear an advertisement in APB: Reloaded from a real-world company that paid for it's logo to be placed in APB. (I have seen this in a number of other games)  The weapons that you can purchase in the Armas Marketplace, although some being unique and only available through Armas at this time, aren't very overpowered. Many people may not know this, but many of the Armas Weapons are simply permanent versions of existing weapons and reskins of existing weapons. Skill plays a MASSIVE role in APB: Reloaded, which many people fail to understand. Every weapon, Armas or not, has a specific purpose, some being more flexible than others.  If you are a brand new player, and don't purchase Armas Weapons right off the get-go, things may be slightly more difficult for you if you were to be put up against someone who has for instance. If you're willing to stick the hardship out for a short period of time, you'll find that you'll be unlocking weapons that are just as good, and as you develop your skills in the game, you'll learn tactics and gain proficiency with your favorite weapon(s).  I own an account-bound permanent weapon that people seem to complain about as being overpowered on a regular basis- the ACES Rifle. Although the ACES Rifle has a fast firing rate and decent range, it's not impossible to beat, as one of my own clanmates was able to take me down a number of times with his stock OCA. As I had mentioned above, APB is more of a skill-based game than anything, and typically whoever lands their shots, and lands the first shots, has a better chance at killing the other player, regardless of the weapon. Look at those (myself included) who have gone CQB with the PSR 'Harrier', (A reskin of the N-HVR 762) against someone using, say, an OCA. If I land my two shots before they land their 8 shots, they're dead. Thus, entering into the next section of this review, the community.  The community of players in APB: Reloaded are quite unique. You'll find that although there are a number of trolls and a quite a few sub-par players who will frequently smear and accuse good players of cheating, that you will meet some pretty nice people on APB. The troll and raging 12 year old population on APB isn't as significant as it is on games such as those from the Call of Duty series.  Being that I've logged over 2,000 hours on my primary character alone, I've seen quite a number of things happen in APB. I've also been accused of using some pretty ridiculous non-existent cheats in the game. (Such as increased weapon damage cheats, increased health cheats, etc.) Although this can be discouraging for skilled players, especially if/when you become questioned or reviewed by someone more important than a raging 12 year old, it certainly isn't a big enough deterrent not to play the game.  My biggest recommendations to any and all new players to APB are quite simple.  1) There are threat levels, identified by color. (Trainee/Green, Bronze, Silver, and Gold) The APB Districts are segregated by threat level, and players can play in servers equal to, or one below their threat level. If you are silver, play in bronze districts. Due to the fact that people don't normally populate gold districts, you'll see a lot of golds in the silver districts.  2) If you have a friend who got you into the game, and they're a gold player, ask them to make a reroll account to help you in the beginning. Trust me, grouping with a gold player when you're brand new is being thrown right into the fire, and it will only frustrate you and make you want to quit the game. This again goes back to number one, play with or below your threat level in the beginning.  3) Understand that there have been people who have been playing this game for a very long time and have a lot of experience playing it. Don't assume that because someone is better than you (especially if you're new for goodness sakes) that they must be hacking. Everyone, myself included, has players that are better than them in APB. It's a fact of life- accept this fact, and you'll enjoy the game a lot more.  4) Join a clan!!! There are plenty of clans out there in APB: Reloaded. If you want to make the best of your game experience, join a clan! Find a group of people who you can play with, have fun with, and who can teach you the ropes. It's much easier to play with an organized group and you're more likely to win your missions if you do so. (Teamwork and Communication are MASSIVE force multipliers in APB: Reloaded, as they are in just about every game. A well-organized team of silvers can easily defeat a non-organized team of golds of equal rank.)  5) Know that you can do things other than playing missions! Although a lot of experienced gold players play in the Fight Clubs, Fight Club is a great way for players to hone their skills. It may not be the best learning option in the beginning, but I promise if you play Fight Club for a day straight once you've got the basics of the game down, you'll learn A LOT!  If you start to get upset with missions or fight club, go to social district and talk to people. There are a number of quite funny people who hang around social. If you're a criminal, why not try your hand at ramraiding? It can be both relaxing and rewarding. If you're new, and you decide to ramraid, go to a LOW population server (I'm talking the lowest possible population with the closest match to your threat level.)  Be creative! Mess around in the designers. Make some symbols or themes. Look on youtube for some tutorials on how to use the editors and hone your skills at designing. That can make you a nice amount of money, and it's always pretty cool to see someone randomly driving down the street in a car you designed and sold!  6) Have fun with the game! If you like it, help support the game by getting premium. Even if you were to only purchase premium once, you'd have the ability to fully customize your clothes and vehicles, and they'll stay that way when your premium runs out.  Although I've had ups and downs in APB over the years, I'd definitely say that APB is a game worth picking up and playing for a while. What do you have to lose?
9192	1	a	Hello, I am your average Fallen Earth player, with your average Fallen Earth player hours.
10409	0	a	Very freaking bad video card wise and ill tell you how it completely crashed my PC that's how!!!
2571	1	a	it is fun play now it isn the funist one yet
2743	1	a	To actually permanently buy an item you have to pay an extreme amount of in-game cash. Besides that it is fun. 3/5
431	1	a	The only masks available to my characters seem to be bags of garbage.
4917	0	a	I'm still curious about hackers/ it is a good game but there are too man hackers and they ruin it. How can I say it's Free to Play and Hack to Win, example Wall hack, aim bot, speed hack, etc.
5506	0	a	Ya, how about no.
9493	0	a	This game sucks. I can't even play it because my 'new' account won't work.
9656	1	a	Got bludgeoned too death, gained flight  10/10 would be cloned again
463	1	a	This game is so much fun to play with your friends, make a gang, rob stores, or make a police patrol and kill bad guys, so nice and it's free !
3004	1	a	good game over all great balanced f2p
2895	1	a	THIS MIGHT BE ALRIGHT
6675	0	a	APB... APB its, its amazeing! The customization, The Detail. It had me playing it for hours. To the point where I wouldnt even know the sun has passed and the day was over. Though the community can be harsh. Thats not so bad. All the guns are ballenced, So i thought.  All the guns you get (In-Game with out paying) are ballenced, I am even talking about you annoying OSMAW, You are balenced as well. The thing is, Some guns in the 'ARMAS Market' Are just plain, stupid. I mean like the universal ATAC or the NANOS. Those wouldnt be so bad if it wasnt mixed in with the commonly known 'De-Threaters'. People who lose matches (So they may join bronze servers, Though they may be a gold threat rank) often ruin the fun time, Win or loss, i may be haveing with my friends. It is just a major killjoy when a bronze comes in with a ATAC and NANO, His skills are just way beyond me or my friends. As they reck havoc on all the missions, till they hit gold. Just to dethreat back to bronze, to repeat the process.  Another problem is the rerolls, People who make new accounts so they wont have to 'De-Threat'. Rerolls are quite common. As the fact i am a R212 and a R009 will join and kick me and my teams butt... Alone. With no help. Not saying they hack, I know some ppl have VERY Good skills on games. It just makes it hard for me to return to such a beuitifull game. This legit  'One of a kind'  game. It saddens me about all the problem this game has.   Lastly my ending result for this game. Sadly would be to  AVOID IT . It is very fun, Very Addicting, Very... Frusterating, Screen punching frusterating. Unless you are a natural born shooter. Evrey one I have talked to agree, that g1 (The Game owners) only have this game running because it is a 'Legit' Money farm for them, All they do is care for the money. I mean look up the prices for your self. All and All this game would be a five of ten for me.  Thank you for reading this review on this wonderfull game. 
5836	0	a	its piece of crap on a stick
9369	0	a	I couldnt even get into the game after I made my acount.
10220	0	a	For those of you somewhat interested in this game, I can review it for you in three words: No, Just No.
2431	1	a	The Closest Thing We Have To A GTA MMO. -F4ST3STGAMING
10335	1	a	I really like this game, it's just that it's starting to feel old and I want something more and something new. I can't find a game like this anywhere else and it makes me sad.
3656	1	a	Worthless POS.
8524	0	a	here's a better idea; how about you make your game actually worth playing and fun instead of a boring â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ of the same recycled â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t missions over and over again?   also another tip; fix your â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game, it runs like dog â¥â¥â¥â¥, even on high end PC's, what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ do you expect out of a xbone version? to make it even more un-enjoyable? i gurante it won't even hit 30-20 fps.   this is why your game is dying,you know you're only doing this â¥â¥â¥â¥ to make more money, and to top it off, this really shows how little you give a â¥â¥â¥â¥ about you're own game, because if you can release and port an xbone version of this garbage, then you can make a fully functional â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game.   â¥â¥â¥â¥ you, G1.
2061	1	a	Strong Recomendation!
6362	0	a	Confusing and weird go play Terraria.
1277	1	a	Fun game totally recomend for RPG players !
1403	1	a	It is really fun
6517	0	a	The game is VERY cool and funny, BUT it have 2 things that totally SUCKS:  -The matchking, u may play against players with LOTS of reputation ( levels ) more than you, i was 59 and i was matched against people with R 149, 229, etc, SUCKS!  -The weapons store, i have just 4 days playing and i have to play against people with more experience AND premium weapons, that means perfect damage, aiming, lots of bullets, etc, and they earn double exp and money than normal people, i understand its common you can buy premium isues BUT the difference between premium and normal is too high, the premium moddified weapons are so stupidly overpowered .   So, if you have money to buy premium stuff, welcome! enjoy it! but if you dont, dont even try this game, because ur only going to lose.
3930	0	a	Me: ggwp A player on the enemy team: stfu â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥  This game is worse than cancer
5666	0	a	Fun game, but it gets boring after a while and it is pay to win.
3883	0	a	Hackers, Hackers everywhere. :)
8093	0	a	This game used to be great, but now it feels like it's falling apart. Just today, I was d/c twice while I was on the winning team. I don't d/c when I'm losing tho &gt;_&lt; The hitbox is simple, and lots of people whine at me just cause I play sniper. I hope the servers stop crashing.  If you want to be successful, gotta spend money to earn money. I don't spend real money, but I do throw in ingame money on timed weapons cause it's worth it. I love the customization in game. The matchmaking isn't so great in that sometimes you get new players against a team with rockets and fast cars
4979	0	a	A broke un-fair piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥.......yet i keep going back to it, I don't recommend you get it because it's addicting, and you don't want to get addicted to this â¥â¥â¥â¥, it is extremely pay to win, save yourself the time and go play a decent game guys!
10454	0	a	Crafting, the game. Be prepare to spend hours upon hours of gathering materials to make your own equipment. The story is moot, and the game in incredibly newbie unfriendly.  Be prepared to learn how to do things on your own.
10364	0	a	bad game, wierd controls and bad graphics
906	1	a	Game is different seems almost to pay to win and most the community is toxic
2258	1	a	It's pretty good but the amount of hackers is really disheartening.
4110	0	a	Can Not Play I dont Why ????
43	1	a	This is probably my favorite game of all time. I love this game for many reasons. One reason being that it has an EXTREMELY wide array of customization features. You can customize pretty much everything from weapons to clothes to cars to custom themes to play whenever you kill someone! Another reason this game is so amazing is because of the gameplay. It never gets boring or bland (especially when playing with friends!) It is also so much fun to pop out and shoot someone down that is about to score the last winning point to cause you to lose the mission. The game has awesome and hilarious physics that will cause your car to literally FLY in the air whenever you hit a ramp! The game is overall very smooth, extremely fun, and very versatile and different. I like to think of it as if GTA and a Cops and Robbers style game had a baby. This game is fantastic.
10872	1	a	Overall pretty good game. Get's frustrating sometimes.. But fun.
7485	0	a	the game:  [cons] very rare updates, except when there is new cash shop items, which is really often. the frequency of new cashshop weapons shows the game weapon balance is .. lets say .. from non existant to â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up. repetitive, will get to know all of the game has to offer in under 1 hour.  [pros] One of the better player, clothing, vehicle costomization you can find. In game editor somewhat effecitve.  The gameplay:  [cons] pay to win, With a cashshop item, learn curve is non existant. repetitive 'missions' it pretty much boils down to a team death match in a different location on the map every time. Horrendous level design. Uber effective choke points renders knowing the map aka time spent in game, more important than your ability to land shots. voip is a must, require real life friends to play with you. no headshots, less lucky kills. less dynamics. steep and stable learning curve.   [pros] you get to drive cars. shoot guns wear fancy DIY textured clothings via in game editior 
9815	0	a	THIS IS THE WORST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2089	1	a	This game has the best customization, hands down, BUT it's cameplay is imbalanced, and very much so pay2win, but even then, it's fun to play.  For those that jsut like doing random crap and looting random places, play it.  For those who are more competitive, or easily angered when killed, I wouldn't reccomend playing it.
2087	1	a	really awesome
9727	0	a	i cant even â¥â¥â¥â¥ing make an account
2523	1	a	APB reloaded is fun shooter if you want to shoot people or just went to kill cars and if you are a law and order kind of guy then ok this is the game for you.
3159	1	a	pay to win but is a really cool game

8639	0	a	I can't tell if I like this game or not because I seriously can't tell if I'm playing the game right or not. I've never played something that's kept me utterly confused six months after playing it.

8171	0	a	Pay2Win Galore.
9872	1	a	Awesome game. Too many quests though at one time. Wish my computer wouldnt lag with it.
2378	1	a	it's free so dont complane if you dont like it.But i love this game free and it's really fun.The lag can be a problem sometimes but i can deal with that
5859	0	a	the type of game where they charge stupid prices for the good stuff
3631	1	a	So awesome couldn't even get it to launch!  11/10
1801	1	a	Best game since pong.
4963	0	a	Back when I had my crappy good ol' Pentium 4, the controls lagged like hell. When I upgraded to a half-decent computer in 2012, the controls lagged like hell. And now that I upgraded to a pretty decent gaming computer, the controls still lag like hell.  In all seriousness, the game itself is fine. The gunplay is what you'd describe as 'good enough', nothing fancy or innovating, but it works. The main problem I had is that the character customization actually lying to you and, as previously mentioned, the car controls. On the topic of characters, once you finish painstakingly customizing your looks (Which you can't change without paying an absurd amount of money I may add), your avatar looks barely like the one you created, which wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the fact that I tried to replicate Frank West and ended up with Sloth from The Goonies.  And as far as the vehicle controls go, they're bloody awful. The cars themselves handle fine, or at the very least the Not!Audi TT you get at the beginning of the game, but there's an almost one second delay between you pressing a key and the car actually doing something, which obviously results in you driving like you drank half the stash of illegal alcohol you were ferrying around town. Sadly the community isn't very helpful when trying to fix this issue, as most of the replies you get are 'You suck', 'The game is pretty big, deal with it', or 'The game is fine, upgrade your rig' which the latter is kinda hard to do when you're running almost top-of-the-line hardware. I'm not TotalBiscuit, goddammit, I don't have enough money to buy four Titan Xs.  In short, if you can run Crysis 1 at 240 FPS on 4K resolution, I'd give it a shot, otherwise either don't; or get ready to do some cardio, as you'll be running all over the city.
9929	0	a	OK, I am not saying anything about the game (in fact never played the game), but i am saying somthing about the account system. The account system is the worst thing since the Pet Rock (thats an actual thing). The reason it's bad is because I can't login. Every acount I make from Gamerfirst I can't play with. So I make the account, then put my email, THEN my computer crashes. But it saves my email and nothing else. So when i try and make a new account, since it saves my email I can't make a new account. I can't login because the account doesn't exist. This happened every time with every game. Again not played the game, Just wasted an hour of my life on an account that is not real...
7091	0	a	this game can be good game but because the managers of the game that only make stuff to sell in real money (weapons,cars,clothes) and they doesn't fix the hit regs and to try to fix the game and to make new engine. that why it's bad game.
10645	1	a	I can make a new review for this game, considering the new owner/host of the game: Deca Games.  They took charge and started working on the game again.   Here's what they've done so far:  1. Spam bots are completely gone, and some of the multi-boxers and hackers are gone. 2. Brought back life into the game by bringing the community together for a big celebration of Month of the Mad God. 3. Gave out free rewards to those active in the community. With Events and such.  Pros:  1. Very rewarding, Challenging dungeons give the better loot. 2. Good community on reddit and mostly in-game too. 3. A Star ranking system based off how many class challenges you've completed by hard earned, long lived characters. 4. DEATHLY addictive. (sorry)  Cons: 1. P2W, buying (gold) will allow you to get some of the best gear. 2. Difficult, hard to get used to dieing. (Even thought its part of the game) 3. Until recently, the game had a bad owner, Game is recovering.  I recommend this game, 7.9/10 :^)
3577	1	a	Free and a worthwhile game for those that enjoy a good cops/robbers gta-esque experience.
7361	0	a	This game has the potential to be awesome but it sucks on so many levels. First off it is a massive grind, you have to invest a substantial amount of time into it to be able to unlock anything at all, even if you pay the monthly fee to increase your rates. On top of that you have a broken weapon system that leaves every weapon with an unrealistic niche forcing you to buy a ton of weapons to be able to fight in different areas of the map otherwise the guy with the weapon better tailored for that alleyway or that elevated highway is going to win regardless of how good he/you are.   The biggest flaw however is the ranking system in this game. It is absolutly impossible to play this game as a new player and have a decent time learning the game because the tiered ranking system apparently plays no role whatsoever in matchmaking. There are servers tiered for each rank on the list, but they are not locked for that rank so someone well beyond your skill level as judged by the game can join your server and will get matched against you in the matchmaking system every... single... game. It just isn't fun getting destroyed mission after mission by female avatars in knee stockings and miniskirts, or flat naked who have hours upon hours more invested in the game to unlock all of the guns and perks and cars and whatever else.   Game sucks, do yourself a favor and go get just cause 2 if you want a freeform driving multiplayer game, or world of warcraft if you want to spend hours of your life doing the same repetative â¥â¥â¥â¥ for hours on end to raise up in level.
2933	1	a	If your interested in playing a MMO which has a INSANE amount of costumization options, then give this game a shot.  If your not interested in costumeization, then walk away. Very Very slowly

7337	0	a	To put it bluntly. It's not a fun game. MMO's aren't my thing really, but this is just bad. To many different tabs, buttons, and overlay options to worry about. Plus, you can totally â¥â¥â¥â¥ yourself over early game, by messing up 1 part of the intro.

8950	0	a	I'm sorry but I couldnt spend more than 5 minutes playing this. The controls felt unresponsive and terrible, the screen flickered and gave me a headache, a nice 'UPGRADE NOW' button thats always on the middle of the screen. I'm going to pass on this one and never look back.

7623	0	a	This game is really bad, the only fun thing was finding a fast car to drive. I liked that I could really customize my character only to finding my character would spawn as a floating hair peace, eyes, a mouth, a pair of shoes and a floating gun. The missions made no sense and had no direction on how to perform the job,let alone could you find your health or change that set up making game-play too complicated, as well as, the game was easy to hack, a conversation happened in chat and next thing I know every car you touched exploded, or people shooting infinite grenades and lagging the server. If you hadn't fallen through the ground yet the game crashes instead, dying instantly as you spawn,pvp glitching the f out and making everyone try to kill you and being stuck looking at your dead body with out being able to re-spawn. At first I liked that I could add my music to the 'in-game player', until I found that the game corrupted all of my music(mp3,mp2) on my PC... by the way that includes game music/sounds for other games!, cut scenes with no sound, like playing any game on mute. If your thinking theirs an update for this game the last one was almost a year ago.. it's not going to happen. Don't even try the game!
8083	0	a	Terrible performance even on high end card and major lag makes it looks like a slide show
3312	1	a	cool Free Action game i Love it
8677	0	a	The game and the idea behind it is good. But the Pay-to-Win system just kills the experience for all newcomers. Basically premium players are guarantee to win, and in frustration all new (none-premium) players don't last too long, and forced to abandon the game. This game will die, unless they change the Pay-to-Win system into more fairer progression level system and true and fairer matchmaking..
9623	0	a	Please do not play this game i have a mega rig PC customly made by orgin and first the graphic are decent but meh the story is nice but this game isn't as engaging i played for a few hours but couldn't bring my self to play anymore the mechanics for aiming in 1st person are unbielivly (how do i make hearts?) so they are horrible and no updates so it gets stale and pvp big FACEPALM it is dreadful and full of hackers just dont play please. and the meta score was paid for LOLOLOLOL
2956	1	a	I've been playing APB for serval years, and i've seen that GamersFirst are updateing the game every week/month with cool stuff, i've wasted 15$+ And it was worth it. I recommend you to Play this game and have fun with others, like your friends, or create new Friends. There are 2 sides who are fighting upon: San Paro, Criminals and Enforcers. I'm an criminal, criminal can ram raid and get money faster Enforcers can witness you and Deliver the money if they Can.  You'll learn fast how to play. The map: Fight club, is used to Comaplte challenges and get JT (Joker Tickets) The others maps like: Finanical And Waterfront are used to do Missions and Rank up, and unlock cool stuff, The max rank is R235 I think.  SO I RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE WHO LIKES ACTION!
4695	0	a	I'm writing that I don't recommend this game because it isn't a type of game that everyone can enjoy. That being said, it you have a large wallet and are willing to shell out atleast $25 then you can consider it something you might enjoy. The game is almost 100% pay to win and being a member with all F2P weapons will almost guarantee that you will slit your wrists and die. Other than that, if you can get past the waves of hackers that go undetected with speed hacks, aimbot, and no recoil then all and all it's not an awful third person shooter.

10517	0	a	Realm of the Mad God is a top down free to play MMO mouse aim shooter with a simple art style. It has been around for a few years as a Flash game. You start the game easy enough, by selecting from unlocked classes such as rogue, warrior, priest, archer and so on. Each class plays the same, you fire projectiles. Have a sword? You shoot projectiles. The only difference between the classes are the stats and the equipment they can use. You can unlock more classes when you reach certain levels with the base classes. Each enemy gives you some minimal experience and leveling up will only improve your stats. There are no new spells and no choice of improvement. It all feels very dull and too simple for a MMO.  The controls are like every other mouse aim shooter, arrows to move with mouse aim and click to shoot. You have a special ability and potions too, but for the most part you can just use your normal attacks. Speaking of the mouse aim, it feels very inaccurate. I can stand still, fire the projectile and the projectile will miss even when I shouldn't. Maybe there is an accuracy stat or something. It feels odd when enemies very accurate. Luckily you are quick enough to dodge projectiles. Again, maybe its a stat and I need to have better gear, but there is nothing on the equipment that shows accuracy, just range and attack power.  There are a lot of enemies, each with different stats and attack patterns. For the most part they have enemies simply shoot at you. Most have single shots, others have double and triple spreading shots. Still some fire a sort of 360 degree bullet shield preventing anything from getting close. The bosses aren't that different from normal enemies. They just have larger sprites with other creatures swarmed around them.  There are quests in the game, but I mean that in the vaguest sense of the word. All quests seem to be kill the big monster. No one tells you to. You just do it. The game points out the direction of the big monster when you enter the location.  The maps feel a bit jumbled randomly with trees and foliage with a path drawn through the map. It just feels like lazy or quick map design and not 'randomly generated.' Some enemies will drop portals to different areas which is a fun feature, but since the areas look just thrown together its always just another randomly thrown together area. You have a mini map that will reveal more as you explore, but if you leave an area and return, you need to explore it again to show it on your mini map. At any time out in the wilderness, you can instantly warp back to the town / nexus with the click of a button.   The locations might look like a jumbled mess, but the town / nexus looks great, but its all just a big store to sell you stuff. All of the stores have items visibly showing you everything so you need to walk over them instead of having an easy to use menu. Another problem is to see the stats of the item you need to hover your mouse over the 'buy it' button. Don't accidentally click that button though. You cannot sell equipment, so you're forced to drop it or trade it with other players, but for the most part the equipment feels useless when enemies drop it all. Plus players are kind enough to just give stuff for free since everything is so abundant.  Normal games would have you kill enemies for gold, but in Realm of the Mad God, you need to buy gold with real money of course. Everything is right there in town / nexus for you to buy after a brief tutorial area. What do you buy with gold? Name changes, more characters, armor, weapons, rings, boxes with random items, keys, pets, extra storage, building materials and everything. Did I mention that when you die you lose all progress and items? So if you spend real life money into a free game and you die, you've just lost everything. Do you need gold to have fun? No. The town / nexus has plenty of people selling gold via their website for real money and it floods the chat for some servers drowning out any real discussion.  This feels like a really dull game that is out for your money. Not just that, but it seems hastily thrown together. The quick simple art style, the slow grind for experience, the awful map design, no real quests, the laggy input, and the inaccurate aiming, all makes me not want to be in the game let alone buy anything in the game with real money.

1731	1	a	Yeah its good although its not my type of game although i love gta this just doesnt have it's charm. But you HAVE to try it out :P

2062	1	a	Next generation MMOTPS. This game is ahead of it's time, that unfortunately makes it run only in newer PC, but if you have one, you will enjoy it.
3555	1	a	First of all I'd like to clear up that G1 as developers are somewhat incompetent only seemingly wanting cash and money from players. So I will put a disclaimer that this review is leaning more into the aspects of the game or the game overall rather than the developers of the game and the decisions made by the company itself.  Now that I've invested quite the time with the game and as the time Im revising this review I have played for about 300+ hours of this game. I feel as if I was a bit too harsh and judgemental about my previous review of this game as I was critisizing the game way too harshly and was a bit biased due to my first experiences with the game.  Having invested a great amount of time into this game I have found that it wasnt as bad as I originally thought it was. The community is active in forums and are fun to socialize and interact with on most cases. Im not gonna lie that there are times when a player or two engages in the activity I like to call 'Who can be the best assh*le' in the game but they're only occasionally seen.  My best tip at this point would be to learn about the game in order to progress as APB Reloaded is a game that not only rewards you if you learn about secret routes or special hiding places for cover but also helps you progress through the game due to the help of the community itself.  I will admit though that before sinking 300+ hours into this game I painted a very biased opinion about the community making remarks that its cancer and toxic. Having personally interacted with the community in order to learn from veterans of the game and learning about tips and receiving advice from fellow players I then came to learn that it wasnt as bad as I originally thought it was.  Yes, the players online are very different from the ones in the forums and I can assure new players that it is not a turn off. The blend is quite well and sometimes even a good pair up. I will say though that if you dont have the patience to get better and invest some time into learning how things work with this game you'll end up having a very frustrating time blaming everyone else or everything else in the game rather than your lack of knowledge of it.  I whole heartedly feel that APB Reloaded is a game that I can recommend now, The graphics may be a little bit dated but that doesnt mean the game isnt enjoyable or playable. The community is helpful and fun to interact with and even though you get the occasional trolls you shouldnt get turned off by them since they are rare encounters. I would also like to state that there are barely any hackers in-game and I think people are mislead about the topic.  APB Reloaded is a moderately unforgiving game. Yes, I will say that it can seem unfair due to other players having upper hand due to the pay 2 win aspect but that has NEVER stopped me before. I have a character in Jericho server which had never seen any money invested to it and is now a Rank 100 Silver threat character with no premium and no overpowered guns at my disposal. The renting system is quite helpful since renting out guns that suit your playstyle can help you compete with various other players that does have premium guns and have invested money.   I also want to say that people think players are hacking but in all honesty those are the results of body modification implemented in the game. Just like in a MMO RPG, APB Reloaded has a system to benefit those who work on unlocking buffs for their characters. For instance there is a series of mods called Kevlar Implants and Clotting Agent. Both are health based modification used by many experienced players that give them an advantage over people. This isnt even part of the premium pay 2 win aspect as the body modifications I just mentioned are available to EVERYONE. Working up the ladder of whichever faction you chose to go with does reward you by unlocking these body modifications. Not only that but you can even get modification to give your guns more edge. BUT WAIT! it doesnt stop there! you can even put modification on your vehicles to suit how you drive and play! Of course you can customize your character but you can also implement skins on guns and even customize your vehicles!  Not only that but you never have to invest anything in the game as there is a system that lets you buy premium guns in exchange for in game currency earned through events such as Fight Club. This system is called the Joker Ticket system which lets players who dont have cash to invest in the game or just dont want to invest money to have an alternative way to get permanent items such as weapons, clothing, and even special vehicles and kits in a FREE way. Completeing objectives to save up Joker Tickets is a great alternative for those who want to play the game but not invest any money into it.  Take it from me who literally has a character that was built without the help of premium or OP guns. Just pure work put into the character and getting good in the game overall. As I said multiple times in this review, the key to APB Reloaded is to master the maps and to learn more about how things work in order to get better in the game.  Anwyays Ive been typing long enough so I will say this before I end this review. APB Reloaded is not a bad game at all. The learning curve is somewhat difficult and may take time to get used to. However, with the help of the community and fellow players you can get better at the game and advance. Try the game out and sink some time into learning how to play better and trust me it will be a great pass time if not a great game to enjoy overall.  Thanks For Reading!  -AgitoSempai (Jericho Server)  PS - Feel free to say hi :D
987	1	a	I can only recommend this game for the patient, creative, and those who like oddities. APB, despite it being considered a knock off many crime based sandbox games, is unlike anything I've ever encountered previously. That doesn't mean however, is it by any means a diamond in a rough. More like the rough in a diamond. Lemme explain.  First of all, G1 is total garbage. They're only goal to milk this game as long as they can before it's lifeforce runs dry. And that's fine I suppose, people gotta make a living somehow. However, this leads to hackers running loose and the only updates coming out for it are all cosmetic items. This game seriously needs a new publisher.  That being said, those players who remain and tough it out through the steaming piles of crap are rewarded with some of the most detailed character customization I've ever seen, fun and rewarding combat, and a great community. I swear, the generally friendly and helpful community is what keeps this game alive. Everyone I've met thus far has been funny, appreciative, and forgiving to new players. Everyone who lacked patience basically quit, so now is the time to join. If you can tolerate G1's garbage. 7/10 for community alone.
9854	1	a	Most people will compare this instantly to the Fallout series, the only thing they share in common as far as I'm concerned is the Post Apoc setting for the world. The game plays more like Neocron, Hellgate London or STALKER.  The game play requires some getting used for people who've never played a hybrid interface game as there is a toggle between Aim/Fight mode and RPG mode. In Aim/Fight mode the game behaves like a FPS. While in RPG mode the mouse cursor is free so you can click on menu items, objects, and such. Many people make the mistake of skipping the tutorial, a really big mistake as a lot of the basic how to's are taught through the tutorial.  Fallen Earth literally has a spider web of story especially in Sector 1 (the beginners sector) where various stories from starter towns and the later higher level towns actually come together or are related enriching the experience. Much more to say, but not much space left to type. . . give it a honest try and enjoy it for what it is

5183	0	a	'lol what's a launcher? what's a registry? lol steam thinks you played it while i crahsed lololol' -The Game's Launcher  I wanted to play this game, since I thought it was a free alternitive to GTA V or something like that, so I got it, and installed the assets. When I clicked played, it gave me an error saying that the game could not load itself into the Windows Registry, then it quitted. Then I relaunched it. Stuck at the splash screen. Launched it again, at the launcher, clicked Play, it just quits, Steam does not register it as a crash, but a 'You played a game!' sort of deal. So I just gave up. Hopefully they will fix it.
8097	0	a	this game isnt that good i mean i went on to the enforcer side and people were talking about being horny and being nude in skype calls
6361	0	a	No, i do not reccomend this game. The game devs are germans so i thought they would sympathize with my character covered in swastikas, turns out they are not like that anymore. Pretty unfun when they perma banned me.
800	1	a	10/10 game exept for the cheaters and the lag spikes ;D
4748	0	a	I do not recommend this game because it's own and run by Gamers First. Whose real name is actually 'Gamers Last' or 'Gamers? Never!' this company doesn't give a damn about players. Their support is â¥â¥â¥â¥, their 'anti hackware' is not only completely buggy and full of vulnerabilities but they also get countless false hits. They use a program called 'Punkbuster', that 'Scans' your system for anything that 'looks' like a hack tool, often getting false hits (Like Torrent Software, Developer tools, worm scanners, hex editors, anti-virus software, a variety of programs and even other games) and sending it to Punkbuster developers called Evenbalance and the company who owns and moderates the game. And although other games use it, those companies have a filter to tell what is a hack and what isn't.   Gamers First doesn't do this, they will ban you for ANY reason, even if it's unjustified and unreasonable, even if you weren't hacking you will still get perma-banned. No second chances, no investigations, no support, no interactions, no nothing. They will refuse to accept any and all tickets, they won't communicate with you, they won't listen no matter how much sense you make and even if you have proof and evidence that you weren't hacking. They don't give a damn about players. Even if that player is a founder in one of their games and has put a lot of money into funding their games. They KNOW their system is broken, they KNOW their software gives them false hits, they KNOW Punkbuster is the worst anti-cheat software ever made, they KNOW they are banning innocent players all over the place, they just don't care.  Play this game and any game run by Gamers First at your own risk. But don't trust this greedy and cruel company with ANY of your money. Don't buy anything from them. Don't put any money into any of their In-game cash or store items or vanity clothing or anything. They will quickly ban you as soon as they have your money and spit in your face like you were nothing but trash. Because to them, all gamers are trash.   Now for the actual review of the game. This game is what you would call a rage game. It is completely saturated with crap and played only by trolls and children. This game will stress you out and make you want to pull your hair out. It is purely PvP and caters to players who are in clans and gangs. Playing this game solo is not advised as you will get picked on, abused and trolled even from the start. The game is practically almost completely pay to win and because this game is like an MMO GTA game, a lot of kids are drawn to it. This is Gamers First cash child, cause so many dumbasses are freely giving away their money into this piece of crap game.  APB Reloaded is actually monitered closely by the faulty Punkbuster software, and they WILL ban you for no reason. The tiniest hit on ANYTHING that the software *THINKS* is a hack will get you automatically perma banned. Even if you don't have any software that can be mistake for a hack, doing something as simpley as clicking too fast or moving your attack button to your mouse wheel so you can fire semi-automatic weapons rapidly just by scrolling your mouse will get you banned. (Sadly, I read that there have been players banned for doing this, simply using the game's own key binding changing option only to get perma-banned.) What's even more ridiculous, is that there are tech savvy players have figured out ways to bypass the punkbuster software and are aimbotting left and right. Don't believe me? Play the game and do a mission, see that guy who keeps killing you with head shots while sprinting at full speed with a pistol? Yeah he is one of them. While there are hackers rampant in the game, players who *ARE NOT HACKING* are getting perma-banned all over the place.   Still don't believe me? Google Gamers Firsts Bans.  you can also go here.  http://forums.gamersfirst.com/topic/301621-november-16-false-positive-bans/   ^That statement is false, as my account was one of those mentioned in that post and I never got my account back. And despite this 'claim' gamers first is still banning people unjustly through these 'false positives'. The false positive they got from me is still unclear, as I never cheated in my life in ANY game. Yet one day i get a noticed I got banned for using a 'macro'? okay, sure, whatever. I don't even know how to use macros.  My honest to God recommendation? Avoid this game and all Gamers First games like the plague, there are a lot of games out there that do what these games do but far better.
8023	0	a	This game is an MMO. If that doesn't tell you what you should expect, probably stay away. If you like dying over and over again, this might be the game for you. I don't, which is why I'm glad I didn't pay for this. Frankly, this is not a review of the game so much as it is of the genre and the community. If you're the kind of person who can keep interest in this sort of thing long enough to get good, my review should mean nothing to you.  As for the rest? The people like me who joined too late/couldn't get the hang of it, and were thus deprived of all the fun this game had to offer? Well, if you're like me, you got interested in this based on style, color, and rampant, light-hearted brutality. You can find all that, plus a single-player or co-op environment that wants you to experience it, in the Saint's Row series. Saint's Row the Third and Saint's Row IV in particular are the closest to what I wanted out of APB. And go ahead and get the full package for the games as well, if you can. Having a tank right out of the tutorial sequence was EXTREMELY helpful and fun in 3.

9065	1	a	Really great game.I don't see why people are complaining about the graphics.I like them actually.Gameplay is a bit diffficult to get the hang up at first,but it catches.Still kind of strange how you need to hold right click to change your view while not in aiming mode.But,I digress.Still a really great game.9/10.Just wish that some of the missions were straightforward,telling you exactly what you have to do,and being a bit more simple,instead of multiple paragraph essays.Still,really fun game.

And the servers, so laggy and always full.  Back in the GOOD days of ROTMG it was a game where me and some friends could play it and enjoy it, no lag, no buying items, no bots, no annoying, selfish devs and the producers didn't only care about their income. I miss it.  Screw You Kabam, royaly and dearly,  Screw. You.

5787	0	a	APB... a P2W game where losers who don't have any skill in games gather to buy weapons that give them advantage so that they can feel a little bit better about themself when they destroy someone with a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ pistol/smg in few hits... that about sums it all up i guess, nothing else needs to be said about this game besides it not being worth your time, don't worther downloading it because you will be disappointed very quickly and you will regret ever being born into a world where this game exists, id rather watch my windows update itself rather than play this game.
9595	1	a	I put in over 100000 Hr and i can say that this game is so MLG PRofesicanl Dwat I Waidsted Awl Myw Money. Its so good that i can say i didnt want to kill my self 30 times in a day when forced to pay this for loosing a bet. Also the admins or so amazing! they like are so mature! They listen to you and make sure all your errors are fixed. Exept all thos times people asked admins for help when they where getting harrased and the admins then harrased them...... So now i will show you how a average joe act on this game..  **** YOU THIS GAME IS GAY **** **** **** *** **** MY MOM JUST TAUGHT ME CUSS WORDS YOU ******* **** *** *** *** *** **   So people are rely friendly and help each other out all the time. This rely is the MMO experience you deserv right?  WRONG    Fallen earth takes the regular consept and makes it better! Example: Long Crafting times Horrible Respawns Ugly World Horrible Quest lines AND OF COURSE! THE BEST PAY TO WIN MOTTO! Erm... I mean ITS THE BEST! 69/420 MLG approved 
8781	0	a	Game used to be fun. I've been a player since about 2013. Got some ups and down, but it was mostly fun. Today, as I come back to play with my friend and wait for the upcoming halloween event, I get perma banned for 'breaking the terms and service'. How can someone break the rules of the game if they haven't played in 3 months? Really sad as this game was really fun, and they are now banning innocent players for others crimes.

7312	0	a	I did not recommend this game it's Pay to win
6715	0	a	A game with great potential, ruined by what only can be described as incompetent developers. This game is mechanically unbalanced and unintentionally designed to bring out the worst in people, and despite the crappy engine the game is built upon that would prevent quick changes on larger scale issues, the game still commits simple game design sins, the biggest one being selling mechanics as premium items.  This is the ONE THING YOU DONT DO IN A F2P GAME, it's the quickest way to unbalance the game beyond the developers control, and the prices in the store are beyond extortionate and exploitative. Despite the various lead developers and community managers that move in and out of the company (which really makes you wonder what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ is going on), apparently no-one collectively sees this as enough of an issue to fix.  It's sad then that it's still the MMO i've played for the most time, but to be honest im hoping now that another much more intelligent developer will make something that encapsulates the brilliance of this games concept and actually be able to make it good, as i've given up on hoping Reloaded Games recognises these elements as actual problems.

7565	0	a	I've been playing APB Reloaded before any of this new breed stuff was even talked about while yes the game is free and quite fun it is a open world RPGMMO but heres the thing the majority of the people in the game are basically maxed out in R wepons and cars which makes actually starting new very very hard the game is quite aggrivating when the missions are one sidded which they most usually are i love the game i truly do but would i honestly wouldnt recomend it to anyone new unless i had a group that is constantly playing this game which i do not.

3472	1	a	Ive played since it was first made by Realtime Worlds and its come a long way and its one of the best games ive played. The hackers are no longer an issue ever since they implemented fair fight. Makes a huge differance in gameplay now. I would highly recommend this game now.
3272	1	a	this game is awesone
1486	1	a	If you like GTA, you'll love this game! Lots of fun, and it's free! Just don't get too upset about those who pay to win.
65	1	a	If the game got rid of it's pay-to-win elements and instead just priced it at $5 or somewhere close, the game would be a slam dunk. It's all you ever wanted out of an online GTA, and better than GTA V online, purely based on mechanics. Sure, the vehicles, guns, and graphics might not be as competitive, but the mechanics are what really matters. The bonding between you and your crew as you ram storefronts and run over pedestrians all whilst shooting at the police makes it worth putting up with the cheap feeling you get from the pay-to-win crap.

5936	0	a	This game is enjoyable, even with the latency issues and frequent hackuzations running around in district chat. I have played over 1,500 hours over several characters (I played since beta, when it wasn't on steam). I loved this game, I really did, but I can't recommend it.  First, the good, the things that just make it fun!  This game is fun! Open world gameplay PVP-ing against the opposing faction (you choose Enforcer or Criminal when you create your character).  Amazing customization. When I first started, I spent so long in character customization that I timed out. I've created some sweet mechanical-looking sleeve tatoos (I need to look mechanical/cybernetic somehow to keep up with my name). Vehicle customization is pretty decent as well. With parts you can buy for G1C and decals you can paint your ride with, you can create a unique ride that will stand out whenever you drive it around town.  Open world. The missions, though fairly repetetive after playing for a long time, are fun when you can come from many different streets or rooftops to attack the point. When not running missions, it's fun to hunt bounties that pop up (bounties are players who have attained level 5 notoriety/prestiege from completing objectives and killing opposing players).  But the reasons I can't recommend it?  Bad devs. Any game glitches, game breaking or not, are not fixed in a timely manner. At times, it will take weeks to fix even fairly small issues. Weapon balance issues are huge. They tweak the TTK for weapons, and now have a district just for testing out new adjustments, which is a good step forward. Despite this, they still have problems.  Bad mods. There are many, many 'fishy' players here, In my 1,500+ hours I have learned to distinguish legitimately good players from 'too good' players. Many blatant hackers which have stuck around for a long time, and have not yet been banned. Oh, and don't think you're safe from the mods even if you don't hack (or spend a fair amount of G1C-premium currency). I have had legitimate friends (who I can guarantee do not hack) be banned for 'hacking.' The support team does not listen, and will ignore your pleads for review.  The final.  If you do decide to play this game, I'd recommend remaining a completely free player, or buying very small amounts of G1C. Remembering that you can loose everything you've put into the game, even if you do nothing wrong. It's great fun with a group of 3 other friends, but you may get frustrated with running into blatant hackers when you want to just enjoy yourself.

413	1	a	A unique take on an open-world cops 'n robbers theme. Pretty fair business model, hard to master gameplay.  Easy team-ups and regular updates in holiday themes make this one a very fun co-op experience.  Edit : Playerbase dropped badly due to promises not held by devs.
7723	0	a	Other than the really good customization features. You are up for a sketchy game. By sketchy I mean, there is no anti-cheat system, nor is there a proper 'Report abuse' feature. They don't care who or what you think is hacking. They just do whatever to buff or debuff weapons and more. The guns and most of the other features are locked unless you have premium. It's one those F2P games where you have to buy Premium in order to get the most out of a game. Of course, most games do the same, but for this game, Premium statuses make the game unbalanced. (This is my opinion and expressing why I wouldn't recommened the game).
8873	1	a	You may have heard this game is buggy. That is an understatment. You may have heard this game is full of chat and PvP trolls. Well I am not going to argue against that. The things is I would not normally tolerate that from a game. It is unacceptable.  The game however is in a league of its own. I cannot take my business elsewhere. There is no Elsewhere. Fallen Earth is an MMORPG that does not always look the prettiest but actually provides you with a massive world where there is a point to going off exploring. Resources are everywhere. Everything is needed in someway and almost everything has to be crafted by players.  Character development is very customizable both in terms of appearance and performance. All clones are created equal but some are developed poorly. It is an easy system to learn, but much tweaking availiable when mastered. Fallen Earth really is the MMO you can play your way. Every clone can find a niche. Fallen Earth is not at all P2W, with the only advantages being convenience and cosmetics for cashers. Even a subscription can be bought with in game currency. The community has many helpful players and questions are answered quickly via the help channel. If you start playing use the help channel. The game is quite simple to learn but not very well explained by the game itself. Stick with it. Each in-game sector brings fun and different game mechanics. Do not be in a hurry in this game. Speed levelling when you don't know much is a very bad idea.
3323	1	a	ruined my life :D liek if yuo kry evrey tiem!
9850	1	a	This is one of those mission type/salvaging MMO's. I really enjoy this one. If you donât have this game, get it. Though if you have a normal computer, I would recommend you change the game graphic settings to their absolute lowest. If you do that, should be fine, otherwise you will rage quit from lagging to the point where you die from it. Because it is a 100% online game (no single player mode), most of the high end graphics is not needed.  Over all I really like this game. The lay out is great, I can play for hours at a time, and there are hundreds of achievements to try and unlock.  (8.9 out of 10)
364	1	a	You should get this game! That is all...
9852	1	a	Hello, Now i dont really play to many MMOs but from learning and knowing alot about them i have some knowledge on them. This game is one of the best games ive played in a while. And yes i only have 5 hours into this game but so far it is a great game.   Weapons-There are a huge amount of weapons in fallen earth, weather its melee weapons like spiked bats or swords to guns like sniper rifles pistols and a bunch of other weapons.  Armor-There are a bunch of cloths and armor that you can get in the game which help protect yourself  Crafting-This is one of the big ones. There is alot of things to craft weather its crating ammo , weapons ,Armor , food , and a bunch of other things.  enemys-There are bunch of monsters and people that you will come across and kill. Theres bosses and alot of hard things to fight, but when you have the right gear and weapons some enemys will become easy to kill but there are alot of hard enemys that ly ahead.  Map-The map is giant! its broken up into sectors with different areas and biomes and you can come a across many things while you roam the land.  Friends-I like to play with friends this game is very fun with a group of friends and take out bosses , fortresses , etc...  PVP-Now i havent done or encountered this. but There are pvp areas all around the map huge areas to where you can kill other players build bases together raid peoples bases and have epic battles.  This is by far one of the best games ive ever played i give this 10/10  Hope to see you in the atomic wasteland! :)

7393	0	a	I hate this game. This game sucks and take a long time to download also. 0/10
4131	0	a	When I've heard about All Points Bulletin for the first time... God, I was excited. It was a fresh formula combining typical 'GTA sandbox' with MMO elements. I followed every pre-release video, trailer and so on. When It finally came out on the market (Funny thing, APB was meant to be free-to-play from the beginning. As we can see now - the chance for everyone to play was only for fabricating the hype) It wasn't really THAT bad... I think that creators of the game condemned their game for failure just from the beginning. They didn't mentioned anything about the REAL formula of APB - 'cause APB isn't a GTA MMO - it's an online shooter with a really big arena and cars. Media and gamers called this game a 'GTA Online'. Back then, the developers didn't deny it.  APB had mostly technical issues, bugs and strange gameplay solutions. But it still offered much fun through customizing your car, your own character and shooting other people with this char. The game was fun to play, but had some unforgivable issues. Now, about so called 'Reloaded' version. ABANDON ALL HOPE, YE WHO ENTER HERE. After so many years the new developers didn't removed 4 YEARS OLD bugs and technical issues. Seriously. What's more - practically, they have created more. The game may not even work on some PC configurations. I managed to launch original 2010 APB on Intel Core 2 Duo + GeForce 8600GTX, but for some reason, after many hours of fixing up the problem, APB:Reloaded won't last played for 0,5h on Intel i5 + Radeon HD7870. Because f*ck the player.  The game is fun to play itself, but after slow progress it can get bored for a while. Especially when you fight those Premium players. The disbalance of Premium and non-Premium characters is very big - in cash, in weapons, in experience and so on. There is even a limit on a graphics that you can put on clothes or cars. Seriously. Because f*ck the player. Customization is still good, even after 4 years. What a shame, that it's so limited for a regular player. But you can still create something similar to your character of a dreams. You can slowly earn up for a car and car's modifications, but it is much longer process.  Driving a car is not very good because of server's delay. When you turn left, you send a signal to the servers of APB to make you drive left, and that causes some lags if you don't have a really good internet connection. This delay may be a bit similar to 'Hollywood car chase', but it's still a technical issue. Still not removed. Because f*ck the player. Shooting is k, most of the time, sometimes your character will not shoot to your crosshair location, because s*it happens. It still fun, and that's an advantage of APB:R's gameplay.  There is a good variety of missions, as well as arenas, so you won't get bored in ~15 hours, at least I was still interested to play even, when I get to know all the game's missions.  If you get APB:Reloaded to work properly - it may be a fun and interesting experience, depends on your liking of 'GTA like' games. Otherwise, you will get upset many times, for sure.  tl;dr Still fun to play, but with tons of technical issues and bugs, much disproportions between premium players and non premium players, try it out, 'cause it's free, darling, my final rating is 3-/6.
3411	1	a	this is good game
4287	0	a	Overall a good experience but i encountered problems when playing this games : - Unfair, When you play your first mission you are matched with people with higher gear than you and is impossible. - Pay2Win, noone likes Pay2Win come on guys :D But i did find some good aspects : - Gameplay is good. - Good community. - No glitchs (from my experience).
8202	0	a	I spent some hefty time with this game, even before it was on steam. It was bad before, and now, worse. I just installed it again today and tried 3 matches. All 3, all Premium vs Non-premium. The animations are still choppy, awkward, with no improvement. Graphic overall, still unpolished as it was 2 years old. The only reason I can possibly think of for one to spend time in this game is for its customization system, but that thing is soo restricted for non-premium (like ridiculously resticted). This is a perfect example of a failed Free to Play model. Don't play this unless you're willing to invest alot of real money, otherwise, you will not have a good time against premium players with all their boons.
5939	0	a	this game sucks nuts dont bother getting it its much worse then warface
2841	1	a	I like to describe this game as basically, 'Multiplayer Grand Theft Auto'. You're in a large scale city environment with traffic, NPCs, and other players and it's third person shooter style. The storyline behind the game makes it somewhat believable: the city has deteriorated and crime is rampant. In a last ditch effort to save the city the mayor deputizes anyone who wants to help enforce laws, thus the creation of the two major factions enforcers and criminals. Characters are grouped (typically groups of 2-4 or up to 8 if you call in backup) to help each other with missions that are assigned by a dispatcher depending on their faction. You can create your own groups with friends or be auto grouped. Firefights run rampant and most are really enjoyable to partake in. But it's the endless amount of customization you can do to your character, music, and vehicles, that makes this game shine. If you can dream it, then you pretty much can create it with all the different ingame editors.
1891	1	a	i had lots of Fun in APB and i still have
10336	1	a	Ok so many things wrong with this game even for early access, Graphics need's alot of work things look really bland to me, maybe look at borderlands concept art or fallout big thing these teams did was take pictures lots of pitures of real life places. Google is a good cheap alternative the horse was modeled really well, clearly had photo reference. Character movement is clunky and your always getting caught on stuff like stairs and doors, try using a low res UV Sphere the collision detection is well old and outdated for modern games. Another option is to put an invisible ramp on stair's and make the box smaller cuz right now it barely fits through the doors. This is my biggest complaint with the game and is something that should be fixible easily if the code is well written. I create a new method for all object in the game and it subsequent object's and states so they can easily be called and tracked. So a player chacter would be one class and everything it needs to make it work is in that class. each part of the character is then section out like arm bone move is in one method collision detection and its position is tracked by that method. Lessons learned from the masters john carmak's books as well Brenda Romaro A.K.A (Brenda Brathwaite) has alot of good books wolfgang engel would be another too look at, he is one of the top graphics programmers in the world. Other then those two massive issues it looking real good for early access and runs pretty well. I will be checking in for the movement fix;  
9729	0	a	this game stole my money i paid 9.99 for the dlc and i didnt even get the code , this game will rob you screw it and its devs

6337	0	a	look only at the negative comments on this game dont listen to the positive one's.
7748	0	a	A decent game to play, gets boring fast, so you will only play in short burts of up to 2 hours; then go back the next week. Don't expect to make friends on this game, everyone is a dik and if you want to have any fun, you will have to be one too. So just bring your steam friends, for a quick session of driving in vans and shooting random people out of the passenger door(s).

9796	0	a	I played it. Got renamed to a ridiculous name because my name offended the you know who. Then the same mod who had renamed me popped up in main chat to ask people to keep the discussion to game related Q&amp;A. I wasnt even chatting at the time, and the people who were were simply chit chatting. Apparently this is too much for this concentration camp of a game. No fun allowed. Only talk about the game.  I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hate this â¥â¥â¥â¥. Burn down every game company that manages its users like stupid cattle. God forbid giving personal details or talking about fun stuff. It might create you know, DISCUSSION. We dont want that. We want stupid morons who only talk about the game and pay their dues. Die. Eat it and die.
9056	1	a	This is the type of game I have been wanting to play for a very long time. They could use some help with marketing considering that this game has already been out awhile and I have never heard of it. It meshes a lot of your favorite sci-fi genre classics and still has enough original content to keep me interested.
10908	1	a	Eh, it's free and really small. Unless your internet is made of strings and cups, it's probably worth trying.
3742	1	a	5 words: Best. Law. Criminal. Game. EVER.   The game is mainly a game where you can be a cop or a criminal, The fact you can have TWO+ playable characters is good. You cancustomize it, ETC.
7396	0	a	I absolutely hated this game. I was put up against players that were way ahead of me right when i started. How am i supposed to progress through the game if i can't even get a kill? Fix that issue and maybe i'll decide to play it again, but in the meantime, don't expect me to play this game at all.
889	1	a	pretty good game enjoy playing.

3731	1	a	For every good there is something bad in this game.  [+] The customization is amazing. This game is not pay to win. Events occur fairly often.  [-] THERE IS A VERY STEEP LEARNING CURVE. The team behind this game almost always fails to deliver on their promises. We haven't seen a big update in over a year. Progression takes a long time. Dying player base.   Somehow, I constantly find myself coming back to play APB.

1525	1	a	A godd gta-i game its a fun TPS the costumazation is endless going from masks to tattos but a lot of cool features need premium acc whitch requires real invested money,there is no single player but the multiplayer ist that much laggy and the grapich are deccent for a free game.The controls are tricky but the options menu takes care of that.I would reccomend this game to any gta fan ,
559	1	a	Oh APB....better known as ALWAYS PLAYERS BlTCHING.  Tutorial: Covers almost nothing besides basic movment. Grahpics: For a game released in 2010, it looks decent, however it is very poorly optimized and basic system requirements will net you about 5 fps. Gameplay: Honestly? It at times can be great, and other times it makes you rage so hard your skin turns green. Between the hackers (which some people will refuse exsist in this game) the tryhards, and the game just downright screwing you over, you will get mad at this game. Playerbase: Filled with trolls and children.  This game is basiclly a GTA MMO. And being F2P they have done a great job keeping it from being P2W. Now on the downside, there are hackers like any other game. Only problem is, those are the same hackers who have played for YEARS. The next issue is the massive egos players have and the complete cesspool community. Played EVE? Imagine that and multiply it by 100. Yeap, that bad. If you can get passed the ignorant children and the known hackers, this game is hands down the best game I have played. I have around 4500 hours, don't let steam fool you. It wasn't always on steam. It's worth a download.   APB features much more than just mission based PvP. You can deisgn your own clothing, cars, symbols, music, themes, etc. They also offer fightclubs which is a fast way to get in the action if you only have a small ammount of time to play such a game.   Be warned however, the cash shop is VERY over priced. So much over priced a single gun runs you about the price of a new video game. Do not buy anything unless it goes on sale, which happens fairly often.
8921	1	a	An okay game overall, but I made some righteous friends on here so 8/10 for that
989	1	a	I Seriously Don't Understand Why People Hate This Game. I See This Game Is Really Good! I Spent So Much Hours On This Game Its So Much Entertainment. I Highly Recommend Downloading It. But There Is Only One Problem. its The Hackers [Speed Hackers,Wall Hackers,Cracked Visa Hackers] - For People Who Hate This Game Cause Most Of The Permanent Weapons Costs Some Cash. Gotta Deal With Life Bros. - -Recommendations Add A Swear Censoring System - At The End All I Wanna Say Is No Offense To Anybody Who Doesn't Like The Game And Have A Nice Day!

121	1	a	A very cool openworld shootergame with alot of costumization options (cars, death theme's, clothes,...). This game provides alot of weapons you can choose out. I playing this game for a while now and i'm still loving it! For beginners is it in the beginning of the game very frustrating that you gonna play against very good players. But when u play alot u will become good 2. :) (sorry for my bad english)
1659	1	a	I don't know enough to talk about it.
2511	1	a	Really good F2P game that takes a unique turn on Third Person Shooters and MMOs. The customization is truly amazing. Customize your body appearance, clothing, car, music theme that people hear when you kill them, make your own songs, etc. Main complaints are that theres not enough content to drive the game and the matching system is flawed. You can either do PVP in arenas where a team of Enforcers goes against a team of Criminals, or do missions in one of two mission district instances, which leads to grinding, as the tasks are repetetive. Upon doing these missions, you run the chance of getting matched up against people who greatly outclass you, better perks, weapons, etc. Think of it like four level 20s trying to take on one, two or three level 60s in WoW, along with three, two, or one level 20. GREAT social and competetive game once you level up in that you can customize everything, show it off, and PVP, but leveling up proves to be more frustrating at times rather than fun.
3647	1	a	It's pretty much the biggest Pay to Win game out there. Is it fun? With friends, Hell yeah!
8656	0	a	Imagine scrubbing your â¥â¥â¥â¥ in the new and improved 2016 edition of SHAM WOW! Its really painful because its actually a brick inside of a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ towel so have fun!
8094	0	a	Might have been good when it first came out, but nobody plays it anymore so there are verry few servers. Also the controlls are terrible, it's extremely difficult just to drive down the street. Basically just convice yourself to drop $8 on gta sanandreas and you have a better game.
4001	0	a	Do not get this game. The pathetic makers of this game will not allow you to play this game unless you have a graphics card that meets their requirements! After waiting for the game to fully download, register to play, then the installer install the game, I found out I couldnt play the game just because my computer didnt fit their expectations, pathetic! Not buying a product from this compnay and I suggest you follow the same, if I want to play a game, and download it, it should not stop me from playing it
8112	0	a	I have not yet got to play this game , However it states that i have played for 89 mins. untrue I can not even get into it and i have loged in iI have created and regiestered but have yet to play the damed game what the hell is it. I am taking every thing out of my laptop now and forgetting I even tried this god awlful game bye bye
10068	1	a	this game is fun... go get the game... no seriously just download it i mean its free... its fun.
10481	1	a	(read it all) im uninstalling the game because i dont like nintendo 64 grahpics but its good aiming system nice wide area a wellthought out game and i played a chick without pants that whole time LOL tan lines OP
8494	0	a	region locked in brazil, meh ps: this game is pay2win af, don`t even install
9690	0	a	Well I don't really know how to start this off so I suppose I will dive right into it. This game is unfortunately a shotty shell of what it seemingly was meant to be. I didn't even play for very long before I got tired of it.   What I don't like:  Non-Intuitive Controls - Seriously, the controls in this game don't make much sense at all. This game is an MMO style game. Most MMO games use the same basic control system for things like interacting with the environment, and looting. This is fixed by spending about 5 minutes remapping the keys to what they SHOULD be for an MMO. It is almost as if the Devs had never played an MMO before to understand what the keyboard layout is. Why are Q and E mapped to 'rotate the character left and right?' What game even has those as keys? Q should be a hotkey ability and E should access looting, same with a right click.  Clunky First Person Mode - Here is the thing about making an MMO with the ability to play in first person. Either polish it to the point where it is remotely functional, or DONT HAVE A FIRST PERSON MODE.  In short, don't waste your time with this game unless the devs decide to make the UI acceptable.
5064	0	a	This game is jackshit. It is literally impossible to play, there are no instructions on where to go, I was lost like an asian kid at the Supermarket. Like oh my god, I didn't even know how to put on clothes. Apparently there are 2 sides. Cops, and criminals. I chose the Cops first because I was curious. I spent about 45 minutes in the beginning tutorial, because they didn't say anything about going to your inventory. I quit on that side, and I went to the criminals side. Even more confusing, as confusing as a Rubik's Cube made By Stephen Hawking with the Theory of Relativity. I just started the tutorial and they just go, 'well, do this â¥â¥â¥â¥ and play.' And they don't give actual instructions. I just spawned a tiny little smart car and started driving around in the City crashing into other players. This game is a pile of donkey â¥â¥â¥â¥. Don't even think about getting it. This is basically GTA's little autistic midget albino baby who is blind.  My friend recommended this game to me. We're actually not friends anymore.
3482	1	a	So, the most beatiful thing about this game are loading screens, character creation, ads and pure concept. Whatever else is just roughly mediocre. Yep, it may entertain you for some time, but... just try it.  (PS: I played this game long before it was merged with steam)
10912	1	a	IT'S CRAZY
2125	1	a	Hate it or love it. ill be there to greet with a Propel rocket to the face &lt;3
1696	1	a	Nothing's more fun than cruising down the street with three guys hanging out the windows gunz blazing. The customization is really impressive, you can create characters and vehicles fresh from imagination and even compose a little tune that plays when you kill someone =) Oh, and it's free!
1002	1	a	Great Free To Play! All I Gotta Say Cause Nothing Wrong With It, Runs Smooth and Plays Smooth, And Reminds Me Of GTA BUT! FREE! Who Can Go Wrong With It?
8270	0	a	Its sad this game is a shadow of its former glory. Kids with credit cards buying the best weapons, hackers, community is now crap...
8653	0	a	run away before its too late
9008	0	a	Having trouble signing in for some reason,I made a account and I cant sign in...Not even with my steam account.wtf
10852	1	a	This game is getting a lot of bad reviews because people see it as 'pay to win'.  I'm here to fix that.  In the game 'Realm of the Mad God' there are thousands of micro transactions you can do to get better gear that would take a legit player longer. The only difference is, when you get the items from actual bosses in the game you learn the value of them, and how to use them instead of starting off with 20$+ of gear and dieing at level 15.  At least they don't sell stat pots in the nexus for real money, that way someone who paid 100$ is still not better than a legit maxed character.   tl:dr You can not pay and get a more rewarding experince!
4626	0	a	â¢ Terrible Matchmaking â¢ Pay 2 Win  â¢ Lots of Hackers â¢ Long loading screens â¢ Requires days of grinding for barely good equipment. 
1829	1	a	Fun, free, and easy to play.
5576	0	a	I would rate it but its not working for me....
8307	0	a	got no play time on this due to me playing APB without steam up.. I have 1000 hours gameplay over 3 years and yet no improvments just gets worse and worse with every 'promise' that they will update the servers, ban hackers, update the game and even just make it fun like it used to be but nope, nothing. Servers havent been updated in years, hackers are everywhere and can just re-roll.. this means that they just make a new account and then start playing again.. it isn't fun anymore, all games are one sided, all guns are only good in certain areas and you have to change so fast to adapt to the game area where the objective is and in some games you switch your weapon and its already changed again because you've been put against 5 maxed rank players and you have low ranks that are all under 50 that have no clue.   Other games can be you with max ranks against low ranks that are all gold threat (highest threat in game) which are very 'dodgy' to begin with even though making a new character keeps the same threat, for example you could have a max rank enforcer then make a new criminal account and yet at rank 1 it will share the same threat level, which would be gold for example. This would be fair enough but now-a-days its an obvious way of seeing if they're not legit. Most are hackers now-a-days even with 'fairfight' which does nothing, they will hack a few games and by the time they get reported they've gone offline and cannot be checked at. Also makes it fun when you can even get into a game with a developer and yet they still hack! you cant even message the developer dirrectly due to not being able too which is always great! :)   Developers are just money hungry, 'new' weapons aren't 'new' they are simply re-skins of other guns that you can get if you want to try and grind against hackers to buy the guns which are for 7 days only and by then you dont usually make enough to get back to cover what you spent on the gun.. It may be F2P but it is certainly P2W now.. Dont bother, games been going down the toilet for the last couple of years and now they've milked enough to bring it to consoles for more mugs to 'play' until its hacked there. Avoid it.. Dev's are useless money grabbers who do not care for the game only for the paycheck at the end of the month.
3174	1	a	Pros + You can do all what you want in this game. There are lots of futures. ITÂ´s NOT Pay2Win, because you can play very well with âSTAR-556 or N-TECâ from the beginning. You can buy also every car with Ingame-Cash or Joker-Ticket. You can also buy R195 modifications for 250 Joker-Ticket.  Cons - The Game needs very high system requirements. ItÂ´s very teambased game. AND lots of cheaters and macro players. 
2577	1	a	it is a good game if you are not old enough to play gta giving nearly the same gameplay 
4770	0	a	The worst company =&gt; Unnecessary gamersfirst =&gt; Inane apb rel... They do not deserve you
6707	0	a	:(
2093	1	a	seriously, wtf are you doing reading this? PLAY THIS GAME!!  APB is an online 3rd person â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t simulator.  Hours of fun can be had and sometimes you just cant help yelling 'â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥T!' at your screen as you get your â¥â¥â¥ handed to you.  Though nothing beats the feeling of rolling in a car through the city with some good friends who you know got your back.
9570	0	a	I farmed vegetables for an hour and a half then used the money to buy a book that taught me how to make the first part of a pistol then farmed for an hour and a half to get the money to buy a book to learn to make the second part of the pistol and I repeated this several times. I then had to farm for several more hours to learn to actually MAKE the pistol, then I had to aquire the parts to MAKE the parts then I FINALLY made the pistol and the pistol sucked.    Also the combat sucks  So clunky  Takes forever to get crappy weapons.  Only way to get anywhere faster than traveling through space nowadays is to put money into buying money to get the book to- Yeah, you get the point. Don't play this game unless you want to spend hours on nothing. Or if you're rich or don't know how to save your money.
6546	0	a	This game is sh*t. I'll play it.
1978	1	a	apb is a good game fun but awesome 
9490	0	a	This game completely sucks, I didnt like anything about it, and its missing sound....... Not recommend
3586	1	a	  this game much fun   
2776	1	a	Great persistant world GTA-like MMO! Absolutely love it! :D
9769	0	a	Best game ever. Its like Sims character editor with less features, wont even load the world after you made your character and all...
4289	0	a	Great concept, poor execution.   If you're lucky, you'll have a good, fair experience with other free players. However, you'll probably match up with some premium guy with an LMG and a rocket launcher, effectively eliminating your chances at victory or a good time.  The biggest problem is the developers with the pay2win style.  If this was remade by literally anyone else I'd prefer it to GamersFirst.
4483	0	a	Cannot Even Open the Game, too many Massive updates. Download GTA IV, play online and get a massive moneys worth.  And Apparently i have played 60 Hours of this game, i checked the Task Manager and a little APB exe was running which was the cause of this.  Not worth a single MB.
9882	1	a	game is gr8 m8, i'd r8 it 8/8 don't h8
2748	1	a	i like this game its awosme but hard to buy cars 
2234	1	a	Good customization
9513	0	a	as much as i like this game it not the game i would play i could not even start the game i got to the char part and that was it no play
10195	0	a	This game give me â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥l cancer from the start to the finish plz fix game so many bugs   10/10 IGN
8229	0	a	Crashing as often as it can.
9012	1	a	Have you ever been playing Fallout? Did you think `Why isnt there a game like this with Multiplayer included?Â´ Well...This game is exactly what you were waiting for. The graphics of Fallen Earth isnÂ´t as good as in Fallout New Vegas, but who cares? You can travel through an area 5 times bigger than that ( I donÂ´t know exactly...maybe 6 or 7 times bigger). The crafting system is the biggest one you have ever seen. It is bigger than in Minecraft! :O. Play it on First Person or Third Person ( Third Person is better ;D ). The best way to enjoy that game is...Play with your friends and enjoy the huge questing system!
6830	0	a	-Newbie unfriendly -PvP and matchmaking is horrible since it can easily get one sided once the game throws high level players agains low level players (found myself doing a mission, half an hour after I started playing the game, where I was up against three high level players, resulting in one shot kills on their side) -Driving mechanics are like strapping your b0ll0cks to a car battery.  -Weapon handling is, well, like removing the car battery, then strapping your b0ll0cks to a machine gun and wildly shaking your pelvis whilst hoping that the only thing youll shoot in your frenzy is the apple on your son's head.  Only good thing in this game is the customization possibilities, as long as you sell one of your b0ll0cks to be able to afford it.
7146	0	a	Used to be addicted and I used to never stop playing. It used to be fun, but the same can't be said.   Now, its a pay 2 win with a 'Rent System' and its a pain in the â¥â¥â¥ to get prestiged.  I wish I could go back in time to enjoy how this game used to be.
4249	0	a	Character and vehicle customations are good  Gameplay is terrible, bad 3rd person shooting mechanics pay to win weapon and micro transaction model awfull matchmaking
10182	0	a	overall boring and difficult to really get into, the FPS elements are there but just not nearly refined enough to really attract a serious fan base other than people who have awesome computers to run it at maximum..With the release of it on Steam the bugs and server issues have gotten much much worse, and lag and really low Frame rates is more than common. Generally i give this game a 4/10 good idea, good back ground, great presentation, but poor game play, and â¥â¥â¥â¥ poor mechanics
9030	1	a	I haven't liked most of Steam's F2P games, but I was pleasently surprised with this one, I enjoyed it much more than I thought I would. I love how the game wants you to make your own stuff instead of looting or buying items. You need to scavenge for scrap materials and use other scrap to put together weapons, like a painball gun that fires metal balls. It's a really cool idea. There's still bugs that need ironing out from the Steam release but the game is worth a try, even if it doesn't look that great. It's free, so it's not like you've lost anything.
4676	0	a	And I thought DayZ was bad
8012	0	a	If you like pay 2 win, bugs, lag, and s*** gameplay then this is the game for you
9530	1	a	Great MMO, wish there weren't better ones out there like NWN or SWTOR But, for end of the world apocolypse MMO, this is still the best that I've seen. 
4582	0	a	For the love of god, don't play this game..
8197	0	a	I do not recommend this game unless they remove all but cosmetic items from the cash shop.
646	1	a	gta multiplayer for people who like to be confused and die too much but it is free
1323	1	a	It was alright when I played, I don't know if it's been updated to be actually worth the time/money. But overall, I have to recommend to at least try it.
5911	0	a	Its a heavy pay 2 win. Sucks now.
593	1	a	Note: Don't spend money on this game. Don't interact with the community. Don't â¥â¥â¥â¥ off the devs or the GMs. Just... Dont.  How to enjoy APB: 1) Make your character look awesome 2) Find some friends 3) Start using call outs and stuff so you are working together as a team 4) Play for fun do not play to win 5) Ignore the trolls  Follow these and you will love this game. Some of the best character customization in any game ever and it's open world take on mission based PvP is fun and makes the game feel different every time you play!
6961	0	a	The customization is awesome! The match making is terrible. I really really wanted to play this. I LOVE THE CUSTOMIZATION! I just can't take getting brutally murdered on every single mission and people telling me how all silvers need to go kill themselves. Playing vs other bronze players the game is fun. You are both new your weapons kind of suck and it's ok. The second you hit silver you will be massacred again and again and expect both your team mates and the other team (they can whisper you to tell you exactly what kind of an a*#hole you are and how your getting 'rekt!nub silver die!*) to berate you constantly. This makes starting out not only frustrating, but no fun at all. I don't want to be a pretty piece of cannon fodder for P2winners, hackers, and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ bags. It's kind of funny that the game's anti cheat thinger is called fair fight when nothing past bronze is even sort of fair. Do I want to spend the time watching myself die over and over again so that maybe I can unlock things that will even the score for a game that might (and probably should) die soon? No thanks. Also the hit detection is godawful. If you think shooting someone in the head should count for as many points as shooting them in the foot? You should ignore my review and play apb.
1444	1	a	Awesome game in my opinion, the character creation is great and it is really fun. The only downside is the hackers and lag. All in all a good game I would recommend if your into the Third Person Shooter kinda stuff.
426	1	a	Love this game, this game is fantastic :p
1658	1	a	we in htis build about to get crunk eyebrows on fleek du fuuuuu 
6894	0	a	It is a huge pay to win game and it is boring as â¥â¥â¥â¥ if you dont add moeny. 0/10 hate alot...
2654	1	a	Rather a lot of fun!
6015	0	a	My hairline cutter made me play this â¥â¥â¥â¥. It was legit, but one flaw. I try to noscope someone and it doesn't work. Wtf? This is the worst game i've played since call of duty ghosts. I feel like i just cut both of my wrists while making a remake of GTA. ok? Stop trying to make a GTA and get a life. if i cant make yawspeed, what is life? i cant 360 just by pressing Q? WTF! This is the worst. @FaZeRain @FaZeAdapt @FaZeApex @FaZe Banks @Faze Blaziken. I hope that this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ on in 2 hours. I am not ever going back to my Hairline Cutter AGAIN, because he told me about this â¥â¥â¥â¥. before you get this game please look at this..... @EverySteamMemberThatViewsThisStorePage
2114	1	a	I actually do recommend this. I really liked the online gameplay, graphics, weapons, and especially the cars. I had a lot stuff put into this game but I actually lost everything about 2 years back. I uninstalled this game because I kept getting an error on startup. So, I don't even remember my account anymore lol. But, I do remember the fun times I had in this game. Pretty fun! :)
561	1	a	This game good but there so maney cheaters that destroy the fun of the game !!!!
832	1	a	f2p gta online. solid gameplay and fun gamestyle
3198	1	a	APB is the only game that I never get bored of. I've been playing this for about 3 years now, and although I don't play it all the time anymore, I still jump on every once in a while, and then remember how great this game is.  They are always adding new stuff and its such a simple idea. You do missions against other teams over and over, but due to the size of the map, the weapons availalble and how fun it is, you never get bored. Get this game now
2954	1	a	APB Reloaded, not that bad but not that good either.  You play as either a cop or a criminal and you do missions while you are able to get weapons, customize your character and hang out. This game is seen as a pay to win and there are sightings of hackers so watch out with this game. This game is fair if you actually want to pick this up as a free to play and you're new to Steam. Try it out and see what you think, I was about to not recommend this game but I did since I had fair enjoyment while playing this game
866	1	a	how do i say this, its like a hybrid of marijuana and cancer, it can spread to people, its cancerous, its addicting and it makes you wanna killyourself
7446	0	a	This game has SO MUCH POTENTIAL. But unfortunately, GamersFirst, or as many like to call them, CashFirst, Moneyfirst, or Gamers' Wallets First, have pretty much destroyed what they game could be. The way the system works give anybody who is willing to borrow their mom's credit card and pay for Premium will have an advantage so massivly unfair that it makes me wonder why they bothered even making it F2P when the F2P users get so royally screwed.  Call me a cheapskate, but I am a person who will pay any initial fee, but I will NEVER pay extra fees if possible. At the time this was written, I was a college student who is, go figure, dirt poor. APB: Reloaded is so much fun to play, but unfortunately, when teamed against people who have payed for extra perks, you can expect to rip out more than half your hair by the end of the round.  The game offers MASSIVE amounts of customization through the wide variety of players you can generate, and the decals you can create to decorate your outfit, car, and more. Though Premium players get much more than Free players. This I can understand, as if somebody wants to pay extra for aesthetic purposes, good on them! However, what you can buy weapon wise tips the game excessively in your favor, making it pointless to really play it if you don't have the money to.
7874	0	a	game sucks. it doesnt even load up for me and for some reason everytime I wanna play the game it has to install everything again which takes about 2 minutes. Just play Killing Floor 2 instead people this game is horrible

9840	1	a	yes it is a good fallout like game 
1628	1	a	ON my last pc i could not play (windows 8) but so far from videos (not gameplay) it looks good!

2307	1	a	you should play even if you have no time!
26	1	a	GamersFirst has â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up a lot, Punkbuster and Firefight suck, and the game has a knack for being 'Pay 2 win' (It isn't really... really. It isn't.)  But, the game is fun and the customization options are actually amazing. So yes, I recommend playing it.
6581	0	a	It's hard to not ragequit.
9148	0	a	I don't write reviews...at all but the hell this game gave me for the first 20 minutes was pure HELL. First, i spawn in the clone room as usual and proceed with the tutorial. The problems started when i attempted to complete the first kill task, I start the fight to only notice there's no sound. No ax swings, swooshes, GAAAHHH, nothing. So after this, I shrug it off as a small glitch that's in every f2p. I get to the point where you aquire the sniper where thereis again no sound; this annoys me so i decide to exit and search online for a fix (It was simple) so i relaunch it ( did i fail to mention each launch took about 4-5 minutes?) and rejoin where my progress last took place (one pro i found). There was sound, scratchy but there. I start the 'kill the sniper' objective only to find I once again have no sound. Oh but it dosent end there; I have a 40 degree pov, couldn't move (almost like i was stuck in the floor or wall) and couldn't see the snipers. I couldn't advance any further so I said â¥â¥â¥â¥ this (20 minutes or so later) and decided to write a review.
7649	0	a	This game is terrible, when you try to do missions you get killed by people 50 times higer the level you are and they camp at the objectives. This game is not for new players or people who HATE grinding.   -50/10
6040	0	a	&lt;-- my first reaction of how bad this game is   Pros: +A lot of customization +Free  Cons: -Pay to win -Bad graphics -â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ matchmaking -No proper tutorial -2 hours is wasted into creating your character  Final verdict: Terrible game which sounds good, DON'T play it 4/10

6120	0	a	like an awful version of Crackdown
10330	1	a	play this awsome game 
8029	0	a	Some good things about the game :  - Best character creator I've ever seen  - Nice take on cops and robbers  - Great ways to customize clothing and vehicles  - You can create your own music  - Wide range of weapons and clothes  - Gameplay is fun for a while  - 2 reasonably big maps to play on  - Great leveling system  *Instead of actual levels, you level up contracts, that will reward you with new vehicles, clothing, weapons, customization options, and new contacts to level up.    Some bad things about the game :  -The game has a P2W (Pay-to-Win) feel to it  *Great weapons cost real money and are very overpowered compared to the in-game weapons  - F2P weapons are very similar  *Several of the same weapon, with different buffs  - FPS isn't very smooth unless you have a good PC  - Driving is a bit slow, reactions are off  *Turning has a very slight delay after pressing the key  - Absolutely terrible ranking system  *The game's 'Threat Level' is basically a ranking to show off your skill in matches.  *The game has districts dedicated for each rank (Gold, silver bronze) but players of that rank aren't forced to join one of those servers, resulting in a high amount of golds in silver districts (Very little, if any, silvers), and many golds/silvers in bronze districts (Few bronzes). This makes it hard for bronzes and silvers to level up.   The game is fun overall but being P2W ruins it for me. I don't know if many others have had a similar issue, but whenever the game is installed to my pc, it slows down my performance overall, but goes away once uninstalled. The game's worth trying out, but don't expect for it to be the greatest thing ever.
6241	0	a	i do not recommend this game its a terrible game the controls are all wonky and half of the games controls dont work super buggy game do not download this game

9808	0	a	this is so retardet you cant even login dont down load its a waste of 5 hrs. of waiting!!!!
4181	0	a	Played this game a lot, spent a lot of money on it, got banned for no reason and support wont help you get your account back if you do get banned for any reason. So if you are gonna play this game dont be good or youll get accused of hacks and get banned. Do not Recommend this game unless you wanna take the risk of getting â¥â¥â¥â¥ed over for no reason.
7959	0	a	First time funny, second and third time funny, too. But then u see more and more hacker &amp; glitcher.  NO FUN. Don't waste your time with that game!
9813	0	a	well... a bit hard to play, specially because of the lame movement and combat system... i know it's old and all, and it has a nice story to... but i had to mess up a lot on the oficial page, game1 page... then, after 1 hour downloading, i had to wait another one installing it. if you like these kind of games, fallout can be found free and it's obviously better.
9476	1	a	This game has to be one of the best i played in months since i was bored and this saved me from my boredom i really recommend this game to people who're bored
4060	0	a	To easy to exploit
2359	1	a	Quite fun, especially if you play with a friend.
6096	0	a	I get the game thinking it would be good, but there is no matchmaking to make the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ fair. I get killed by â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Prestige 5 Enforcers and I still have all default weapons and they have â¥â¥â¥â¥ing RPG's, Overpowerd Shotguns, Mg's, and Snipers making the game Unplayable unless you becone a enforcer but where is the thrill of stealing and commiting crime?
6317	0	a	A Pile of S***. Hated every second of it. Tried to like it but no chance. 0/10  The Machanics for driving isn't good, players are also idots as they a) lag, b) crash into you during missions causing you to loose.  Could do better
6201	0	a	I cannot even make it play
8075	0	a	I bought this game on original release.... why should i pay to play?
3376	1	a	it soo much better now than it was. would also be beter for m if i was a good shot.
10599	1	a	This game is literal â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hell, not to say it isn't a fun as hell experience. It's roguelike, so if you die when you're lv 20, that 14 hours you put into that character is gone. It's fun, but hard.
7097	0	a	This game is a pay to play type of game, when it first came out before I had steam the game was fun. But now its disappointing to say the least. I am sure if you had plenty of spare money to just throw at the game then it would be fun again. Not to mention, that people are rude. Even people who are 'supposed to team with you' they will do whatever it takes just to mess up the game or mission' needless to say... I dislike it. It is free however. Definitely wouldnt waste hard earned cash on it though.
2181	1	a	You know, ever since I got my new gaming computer and a lot of money to spend on Steam, I thought I would return to this game and give it a look. Now I read all of the more popular reviews, and I do not deny their complaints. Unbalance and camping is an issue, I am sad to say I take part in this. But heres what people don't understand... this game requires some actual f***king teamwork to do the missions effectively and to plow right through the camping team. The game does not look the best, but it is one of the most flawed masterpieces that are free I have seen. It is the GTA: Online we want. You could run it on a potato with a screen attached to it and it would still run. 3 almost 4 years later, they are still updating and fixing the game! I played GTA: Online on console, it got boring rather quick because there is no real challenge or anything really, it is all created by the players themselves in the bad sense. Here, they have systems to keep the system balanced while also having the difficulty up high.  Where it shines...  Where this game shines is in the customization department. It has been rated one of the best customization system in gaming because of how diverse you can make your character from everyone else. Both sides have their pros and cons and their balance is equal due to the nature of getting the same weapons. Veterans are rewarded better guns but they are not too much of an improvement. Criminals have easier opprotunities to earn money outside of missions but they don't make as much as Enforcers. Enforcers don't have as many opprotunities to earn money outside of missions but they get 2x the amount of money for winning missions. It is all about skill.  Where it falls...  Where this game falls flat is in some of the open world aspects. Emotes are locked off for some reason and the higher your rank, the more you unlock. NPC's all have repeating player models but at least have different languages. Grenades are delayed in killing a player if it is right at their feet, vehicles driven by enemies can run you over and kill you at anything higher than 5 miles an hour. Free to play players are given limitations on how complex their character can look, and complexity is added with decals, customization, etc of clothing, though the preset clothes offer insanely high complexity if they are worn which could conflict your outfit, which you get 2 slots for outfits and an additional one for completing the tutorial objectives. Vehicles handle decently but good luck trying to go in a fast car and not get lag from the high amount of pop in on max settings. Lag is caused by pop in and that one prick from a 3rd world country who wants to play on an english server and has bad internet. And finally weapons tend to get very unbalanced if your up close and personal, there is no melee attacking so you have to spray more bullets into the bad guy's face than they do to you.  It may sound like I am ripping on this game, but it is still a more playable GTA than any other gta games on steam.
757	1	a	This is what GTA 5 would be if it were always online and even more violent as â¥â¥â¥â¥ 
7864	0	a	I wouldn't rcommend this game to anyone due to the incriminating fact that it takes atleast an hour to setup your character and it hard to navigate through the selection screenes.
8396	0	a	By far the worst game 'on the market'. It has easily crumbled to ruins after what the current leaders have done to this game. They let it die and they ruined so much behind it. It used to be a fun, great, addicting game. But now it's a struggle just to even attempt to play the game. The issues that are presented are overwhelmingly frustrating. Let's talk about these flaws.  The connection issues that arose as of late making the game unbearable. The server has some serious kind of issues where the game freezes, your ping spikes up anywhere from 1-200 at this exact moment, your FPS drops up to 50% or more, and you start teleporting or 'rubber banding'. I have never, never in my entire life as a gamer, played an online game that had connections issues this bad. These spikes occur a few times throughout the minute, ranging from a couple to maybe 10 or even more.  Next, we get into the development of the game and who's behind it. Basically, the development is non-existant. This game has barley changed over the course of years. The original developers that had heart and care to make this game great and work on have been gone for quite a long time. We are presented with MEDIOCRE updates time and time again. The only updates that do come out take much too long and bring content that is meaningless. The big picture of this game is a complete failure. A new engine upgrade has been in the works for what, close to two years? Where is that development? We get pictures and false promises. False promises is all that this game is made of. The dev team is quite pathetic no matter what the size. I know teenagers that would do a better job with their amateur development skills in less than 3/4 of the then that of APB devs. And those devs that did stay up until recently are leaving to pursue better things.  There is simply no creativity left. There is nothing left. The game has no quality, it isn't fun to play. It's dying and it's been dying.  In game there are so many issues, so many things that need tweaking. The updates that we do get are horrible and frowned upon by the community time and time again. Lots of aspects in the game that are flawed, don't make sense. Bugs, glitches, stuff that has been here for YEARS completely ignored. Lots of cries that were never heard or reached out to. This is negligence at it's finest. The player never had a say in anything.  They attempted to merge the districts together in order to 'better' matchmaking and open more opportunities. However this was the start of all of the connection issues and the real death of this game. Even with the merge, the servers are very much dead. They have less players than the servers had alone before the merge.  This alone paints the picture of how this game has been going downhill.  Time and time again they neglect their fans that have been loyal all this time. And we get nothing at all in return. Customer support has forever been non existant and they really won't care to help you no matter what kind of issues you have. I have been faced with this multiple times. Gamersfirst staff only care about pushing more sales and more 'joker mystery boxes' because they think this is where the appeal lies. They only ever cared about the money. And nothing else. We are all bent over with our knee-pads on and sodomized terribly to this company.  Tiggs was the worst thing that ever happened to this game. I was never even slightly fond of her. She is just a muppet and her personality, tactics, and loyalties are a disgrace to the game. Why, out of all people, her? Just take a good look at this person and realize that she was a mistake.  Today stands the day where I lost everything I had for this game. There was a time I was so addicted I left my life behind for this game. A time where I considered this the best game of all time for how unique and creative it was, different for the time. It was that fun and addicting. However that is no longer. And if I were to rate this game today as it stands, I would give it maybe a 2.5/10. I even think the worst multiplayer game of all time (Infestation Survivor Stories) puts this game to shame.  I honestly hope that this game dies very soon or gets a major overhaul with a complete new owner and staff. But that won't. Once this game dies it will be taken into private hands and modded by fans that will make the game great again.

648	1	a	best game u will ever play
938	1	a	Only after 800 hours of this game do i truly know the nature of this game, the grind is real however p2w is existant and a bitter community drag down the overall experience. There is a faulty match making system which can pit 1000 hour veterans towards new recuits starting the game. Nudity and overall sexuality is overwhelmingy evident throughout the game, Social District being a prime example. Despite the games countless downfalls such as consistent lag spikes, the game reaches a level of customization that is not matched by other games. The total verdict of this game is 10/10 would recommend Fak you give me money.
2019	1	a	A very fun game, full of hackers and a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ community. The former is being addressed very well by G1 and their 'FairFight' system. The latter is just there, as it is in any game. Amazing customization, and amazing gameplay. All unbalanced guns have been refined and it now feels as if this is a much better version of GTA Online. I definitely reccomend it. It's worth a try.
917	1	a	Fun game but too much hackers &gt;.&gt;
10795	1	a	Great Game. Really Liked It.
5852	0	a	This game is full of hackers and if one of u hackers see this just kill urself and it is p2w â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game it â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sucks i got killed in the spawn 100000000 times by a hacker
287	1	a	Best game ever i played with friend
5017	0	a	If you like playing one of the best games ever and they having it lagged server wide every 15 mins until you want punch out a dev, this is the game for you. I am literally the most calm person I know, and this games lagg issues â¥â¥â¥â¥ me off so hard I raise my voice and rage quit....... I NEVER rage quit and NEVER raise my voice. This game is literally making me a worse person. Gameplay is awesome, street fights are awesome, customization is UNREAL!! This sounds great until you lose 3 or 4 matches in a row because you are lagging for 1 min and 15 seconds you needed to tag a wall. â¥â¥â¥â¥ you devs, for making such an amazing game and then making it unplayable.
782	1	a	Fantastic Game. If you like the Saint's Row Serioes, you will absolutely FALL IN LOVE with this game.
4087	0	a	Just changed my review from recommended to absolute piece of crap. They recently did a server merge that makes the game unplayable becasue of ms instability. Not sure if I should be delighted that I can't play this game anymore.
4152	0	a	449 hours on record, 600+ hours off. 1 conclusion, sh*t game.  Play Peggle.
10418	0	a	Um no thanks, not my style of game, very standard mmo, fallout feels, gameplay sucked and way to many skill butttons for my liking.
7556	0	a	This game is terrible. I'm so tired of mmo developers thinking that they can get away with aweful gameplay. The matchmaking is down right infuriating. The worst part has to be the driving as it feels like you are driving on ice the entire time. The gun play is lackluster and something I would expect from a ps2 launch title not a PC game from this decade.
5281	0	a	The game is absolute trash. It's no fun. The only way it keeps players is making them addicted. And making them hope one day they'll get that engine update. You will expect most people that play this game have no friends which you always have to expect. The community is is just horrific and unexplainable. The custimization is to primitive and needs to be improved. The graphics are insanely outdated. The gameplay is repetitive. The weapons don't even make sense.   Don't play this game if you don't want to waste your life. I do not recommend this game at all. It might say I played for only 300 hours. But that was when I got steam. I've played this game for over four years and I regret all of it. There is better games out there. Just steal your mom's credit card and you will get games that have the best they can offer.
9483	1	a	Fun for quite a while actually for a long time for me but it gets boreing after a bit (played solo most of the time)
9976	1	a	The title has nothing to do with the earth falling through space.  10/10
6172	0	a	Its a pretty average game at best. Its just a gta ripoff with bad graphics poor driving mechanics buggy af takes too long to load. its pretty fun for the first 10 minutes but just gets repetitive and boring. overly complicated and just glitchy. if you want to try a free poorly made version of gta san andreas then this is the game for you
4568	0	a	Here is what I think. APB Reloaded is a good Game, but I feel that I should both critisize and nit pick a lotta things about this game  One is the SMG charging and the repeditiveness to lose to another player because of the overpower of the SMG's in the game. It is so god awful and OP, It made me stop playing this all together. People would just â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sprint at you, boomboom â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ you're â¥â¥â¥â¥ed. They do it with shotguns even. It's stupid as all â¥â¥â¥â¥, also, the new Argotech ACES R&amp;D III is the most OP weapon in the game, and the most unfair, it directly hits, no need for anything else, no range no nothing. People running around with OSMAW Bazookas and silly Argotech ACES SMGs are cowards and are idiots for buying something for a cheap kill every five seconds.   Two is the Customization, specifically for males. I generally have a Randy Savage-Esque Character, but I want more than a Randy Savage look. I want to see hair that will SURPASS my shoulder/neck. I want to see long where is surpasses the shoulders to even the top half of the Pectoral. I really do not care what the general style of man is, give us that choice please. I have a problem with games that never seem to give a choice about Hair style for men, and just give the more mainstream stylings and as I repeat, absolutely sick of it. I want to see a helluvalot more.  Three is the Car handling, which is GOD AWFUL. Simple, It's so unecessarily hard. Go around a corner, you hit a brick â¥â¥â¥â¥ing wall in 12 seconds and then your dead.   Four... The â¥â¥â¥â¥ing unbalancing of the 'threat levels'. Bronzies all in one, but goldies and silvers mixed together... this game is way under balanced and stupid. it just is horrifingly â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. I kept on getting my â¥â¥â¥ handed to me because of the Goldies 'better skills' and there silly pay 2 win cheapo weaponry. This game HEAVILY relies on you having to buy weapons all the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing time and having them rented out instead of kept which is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dumb. You basically are vulnerable as a cop or a criminal. Oh but the Enforcers (cops) have all the advantages of quickly getitng everything. Yeah. The Goods It's Free, so if you are looking for a filler game, go ahead, get this It has the Best customization, despite what I say about Male customization. Sometimes, you can win by using simple weaponry and stuff. SOme of the Pay 2 Win items are pretty good if you think about it. Most importantly, it is a co-opish game, so you can play with friends  Overall, If I were to rate tis on a simpler basis, it would be atleast a 5/10 Because of the new crap that G1 and Reloaded added.   Thanks Reloaded, you guys do not know anything about fairness.  Edit: I am putting on the thumbs down, but it's your choice. at this point I am in the middle. ANd the reason there is so much bad is BECAUSE this game has too many rage inducing moments and the
860	1	a	Am i the only one whos running APB fine? all these bad reviews and im not even crashing or getting exploded or Geting Aids or cancer, Its a Good game as long as u dont â¥â¥â¥â¥ around with the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game files XD

10259	1	a	My most Favorite game of all time .. This game has everything a wast lander could ask for, Open world(Sandbox) lots of equipment and weapons .. I truly love this game.
704	1	a	APB: Reloaded used to be really pay-to-win, but somehow they fixed it. You can customize your car, clothes and character. Vehicles and weapons have mods to them. Its a subscription kind of deal, you hire guns with in game money for 14 days. The guns with mods on them already aren't that expansive. It is expansive though to customize your own package.  You can short cut the system by buying the guns/vehicles with mods with actual money. Buying premium will double the exp and in game money you get.  Overall friendly community. You can easily play without friends with the auto group system. Full servers, more criminals then enforcers though. I recommend choosing the enforcer.
2278	1	a	Love it man just need a good net and a pc but i love this game since gta 5 hasnt released for pc its like a replacement :D
2405	1	a	APB Reloadeed will give a hard time to newbies, it's best to start with friends which are higher level, but overall, without the hackers and stuff, it's a pretty good game !

9038	1	a	 Really good and exquisite gayem 
10009	1	a	Hello, Now i dont really play to many MMOs but from learning and knowing alot about them i have some knowledge on them. This game is one of the best games ive played in a while. And yes i only have 5 hours into this game but so far it is a great game.   Weapons-There are a huge amount of weapons in fallen earth, weather its melee weapons like spiked bats or swords to guns like sniper rifles pistols and a bunch of other weapons.  Armor-There are a bunch of cloths and armor that you can get in the game which help protect yourself  Crafting-This is one of the big ones. There is alot of things to craft weather its crating ammo , weapons ,Armor , food , and a bunch of other things.  enemys-There are bunch of monsters and people that you will come across and kill. Theres bosses and alot of hard things to fight, but when you have the right gear and weapons some enemys will become easy to kill but there are alot of hard enemys that ly ahead.  Map-The map is giant! its broken up into sectors with different areas and biomes and you can come a across many things while you roam the land.  Friends-I like to play with friends this game is very fun with a group of friends and take out bosses , fortresses , etc...  PVP-Now i havent done or encountered this. but There are pvp areas all around the map huge areas to where you can kill other players build bases together raid peoples bases and have epic battles.  This is by far one of the best games ive ever played i give this 10/10  Hope to see you in the atomic wasteland! :)

10806	1	a	Honestly love this game. played it for hundreds of hours and cant get enough of it. expecially now that DECA took over the old holders of the game. This game has a great community and lots of friendly people to play and have fun with
2395	1	a	One of the best 3rd person shooters I've ever played, lots of fun in a massive city!

1218	1	a	I highly suggest not playing this game,unless you can get by all of the bull it has to screw with your comp you may have a fun time playing it,otherwise prepare for a trudge through some serious trouble
10322	1	a	Fast-paced, fun, and definately intresting. This game provides many elements and game styles that most newer games lack. This MMO is a must play.

823	1	a	i like 2 kill things and steal things it allows me to act like a criminal from the relative safety of my home 10/10 game would recommend
10264	0	a	This game is messy and is free for a reason. Just simple dont play it, there is more out there that is WAY better.
9945	1	a	I RECOMEND THIS GAME HIghly as soon as i played it i fell in love ;) 
5610	0	a	*** UPDATED ***  A game that shut down two weeks after its initial release because of Realtime Worlds closing their doors. GamersFirst took control of the game, and in short it is now a tower of duct tape.  The premise at first seems cool, gangs and vigilantes fighting in a modern urban environment, with 100 players in one map causnig chaos. The issue is Realtime Worlds nor GamersFirst even bothered to adapt their own servers or the netcode to handle that many people. While you won't experience unplayable lag, there will occassionally be spikes.  APB Reloaded's community is nothing but pure toxicity, consisting of adults and teenagers alike with the mentality of a child. Yelling/swearing in chat or voice is not uncommon, and their fuses are like that of a munitions warehouse. The worst part is this community thinks the game qualifies as an e-sport, if you can read that through all the vulgarity.  Old recylced humor, internet celebrity wanna be's, and sex jokes are all too common and this is one of the reasons I left. It annoyed me to no end.  Probably the most sinister of activities is the company running it. They made it Pay to Win locking all the cool stuff to paying, and is hellbent on taking advantage of the toxic community in order to squeeze every single penny out of them.  The only reason you should play this is for griefing purposes. Play as an offensive character and â¥â¥â¥â¥ someone off, that's all I ever did, and I will never forget the golden reactions.
10915	1	a	It is endless!!! So much fun!!!
5931	0	a	good graphics not such a bad game  10/10 would recommend
10340	0	a	Character customization is decent. Concept is good. Default keybinds are not intuitive, and make switching weapons clunky - especially since there's no way to draw two one-handed weapons at once. Skill/AP system looks shiny enough, but there is no apparent in-game info on what's most beneficial/what should be focused on - ask on the help channel, and you get pointed to the wiki site. I'd rather be able to play the game than spend all day doing research on a wiki. Combat is awkward, with targeting being off to one side of the character rather than in front, and the hitboxes seem off sometimes. Running away/kiting doesn't seem to be a viable option, as melee enemies are able to hit you from several feet away - you'll just die tired.  Found the game on a top 20 MMO list, decided to give it a try. Was excited to find there might be an RP element, but never saw any of that in-game - might be difficult as a F2P player to RP anyway, since there's no access to public channels? Must be at least a 'Freemium' player for that.
3827	0	a	The thing about this game is that the company that runs it either doesn't care or is just terrible at taking care of it. As said in previous reviews, if you are not lagging so terribly that you wish your own Mother would murder you, then you're being disconnected from the servers. If it's not the lag that drives you away, then it is most certainly the community of players in the game. There is little to no respect whatsoever among players, and even less for the game itself. This game is riddled with hackers and cheaters. Some may say that this game is highly 'Pay-2-win', although that's not always the truth. However, if you choose to pay for in-game items, be willing to pay quite a bit.   Having said that, I think that in the right hands, this game is the best Free to Play game available. I still play it in hopes that maybe things will get better, but I guess I should know better by now.
8719	0	a	It's like Saints Row. It's ok, not the best and not the worst.
124	1	a	Dis game is alright, its not the best and have many problems but i still play it, cause i got potato sweg yup mhm =)
3971	0	a	It's not a bad game, but it's anything but good. The driving is annoying, the gunplay is nothing spectacular, and the AI is crappy (this is the best word I can think to describe it as).  All this is a pay-to-win mediocre cop vs robber game that's not really all that fun and could really use some major fixes and fine-tuning to mechanics.  However, because it is free, give it a try and see for yourself - some people actually enjoy these kind of shooters, so you might as well. 5/10
5187	0	a	1 thousand hours down the drain. i could have been spreading the word of god instead and got into super heaven with all those hours i spent playing this game.

2709	1	a	An amazing game where a conflict cops/criminals is bloodly, there're a lot of action, in big districts, a lot of ingame hours !
9936	1	a	For someone who does not play FPS, I found this game quite enjoyable. It is not solely FPS though - you can switch to a third-person view as well. I like that versatility and the game play itself is enjoyable in my opinion. The ability to carry multiple weapons at once as well as switch them effortlessly in a fight is my favorite part of this game. So if you run out of ammunition, switch to your ax quickly and hack away at enemies before they can take you down. I also really like that there are PVP areas and the entire game is not a free for all. That is what usually steers me away from FPS games, the thought of walking up to a vendor and someone just taking me out and running off. I've experienced this and it is annoying.   The other feature I really like is the real time crafting system. You can craft while doing other things as well so you aren't stuck in one place waiting for an item to finish. In all honesty, it feels like a game that is more enjoyable with friends, which is the only reason I don't have it now but it can be good for some solo play. It's one of the good games in the free to play category, I'd definitely recommend it as I have a few times now. In fact, I am grabbing it again as I type this right now. I give Fallen Earth 10/10
8487	0	a	Tis game is good if you want to smash your PC against a wall. It is full of pay-to-win players and is not fun unless you pay to win.Matchmaking is trash and the players are bad. DONT GET THIS GAME
3136	1	a	IS THE BEST GAME IN WOLD 
7607	0	a	Bad Community, Bad Servers, Good Game. Don't play without doing so with someone expirienced.
3996	0	a	Its a good game but dont work at windows 8. But if you got it to work plz tell me
8539	0	a	Most broken game i have played!  performance is â¥â¥â¥â¥, uses ages to load anything, have to use 48x AA to fully use the gpu, and you're stuck with 75 fps the pvp is complete â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t as mission makes you face people with rpg's that instakill you or snipers while new players are stuck with a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ assault rifles and a pistol with barely any damage.
3985	0	a	This game is utter garbage. Stay away.  The audio is annoying Graphics look like they belong on a PS2 era console Its pay to win The gameplay is rage inducing
10756	1	a	dont die and you will have a fun time.
9830	0	a	This game sucks. U don't understand any thing it's sssooooooooooooooooooo bad game!!!!
4764	0	a	This game just will not behave. I made an account before I downlaoded it, launched it and logged on useing the account I made. Then it said it was invalid, so I made another account, and THAT did not work, then a third, and months later I downloaded it again, useing all three acounts to login with, and all of them were invalid. It is still like that, and I did not get an email for my roblem yet when I sent in a report, so I do not reccomend this game...
3907	0	a	Don't get me wrong, i love this game but...  Anti Cheat is crap, mostly Pay 2 Win and the servers are crap. AND dont forget about the Engine! :D  Just PLEASE, don't waste your money on this game until they fixed all those issues.
1567	1	a	  Liked this. But dislike all the hacks
3746	0	a	After clocking over 1000 hours on this game (300+ before steam merge) playing since 2012, i have remained a faithful customer through thick and thin, even spent a total of $560 USD ($768 AUD) on in game items like cars , clothes guns... even got a nice collection of legendaries but up untill a few days ago when i couldnt log into my account due to it being BLOCKED?  After contacting Gamersfirst regarding the issue, they palmed me off to Punkbuster who informed me i have a global ban due to cheating...(WTF!!??), they informed me there is no way to tell how or who but all they know is there was an interference with punkbuster so they refuse to lift the ban because they said it might happen again, so i sent another ticket pleading my case and what was happening at time of block(which was closing apb with task manager due to game crash) and they just deleted without even reading  Today i have recieved an email from gamersfirst saying my account is cancelled and pretty much 'smell ya later'  VERDICT: Dont give these guys a cent and dont ever think they care about their customers because they clearly dont. i've always encounterd hackers in this game and always annoyed me, but being banned for hacking when you werent is absolutely disgusting.

1911	1	a	its great:D hard to grasp at first though
1651	1	a	It ok
3418	1	a	Very Good Game. Kindam pay to win, but still you ca have lots of fun when you are skilled to use the starter weapon.a
9747	0	a	This Game Sucks WORST GRAPHICS I SEEN IN MY LIFE 1/10 IGN
7933	0	a	This entire game is based off of the classic 'MMO' grinding. This doesn't translate very well into a GTA 'cops 'nd robbers' setting. This game has so many flaws, 80% of my time playing this was just trying to get it open based on multiple launches. It's not worth the download time and the stress. Don't play this. Jesus christ, between the loading times and the god damned lag when driving a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing -CAR-, WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE DONE EASILY, MIND YOU, this game is a mess. It needs to be pulled into the backyard and shot OR redone from the ground up, which is something I -KNOW- won't happen. God damned. I'm never going to get this time back from my life.  I give it a ten because I'm a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing idiot.
4459	0	a	It crashed my driver and graphic card and it broke gg would spend $500 agian
7695	0	a	It's a good enough game (Gameplay, Missions (kind of?))  But the one thing that let me down on this (now â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥) game?  The community. DDoSers / DoSers, Hacks &amp; don't get me â¥â¥â¥â¥ing started on the micro-â¥â¥â¥â¥ing-transactions!
10762	1	a	I love this game its really fun and if you dont like it you never paid money for it so thats helpful i know ive bought games i dont like
4230	0	a	This game is a clunky, pay to win, grand theft auto wannabe with floaty driving controls, and awful gunplay. Just because I don't invest money into your game doesn't mean I shouldnt have a CHANCE. The gun you start off with is so weak, I unloaded 3 full clips into a guy (Who might I add, was decked out in fancy micro-transaction clothing.) and he had hardly a drop of blood leave his body. Then he proceeded to pull out his micro-transaction LMG, soot me three times, and kill me. This game is terrible, you might think I'm being unfair, but I've put almost three hours into this game (which I know isn't the highest amount, but this game is so bad...) through three seperate occassions thinking I might have been a bit too harsh, but no, this is just plain bad.
7609	0	a	when i can even get this game to work its awseome but i had to make a new charter when i saved and my pc crashed 5 min after
3534	1	a	Got ran over by my friend and lost 60k  12/10 would work so hard again
6402	0	a	Filled with brazilian â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and a poor quality engine poor support and lack of diversity dont bother with it
10629	0	a	Why would I recommend this? well this game has SOOOO SO much potential, and i heard it used that potential for good, but i have seen reveiws saying it only wants your money, i think this is true, i cant even play, i launch the game and login but the bottom right of my screen is taken up by an ad begging for your money, I CANT EVEN PLAY BECAUSE THEY WANT MONEY!
2661	1	a	There are a few thing I have to say about this game. It grabbed my attention because it was a cops vs. robbers type game that would keep me entertained for hours. First the cons, very repetitive, stupid A.I., cars are difficult to drive, and hard to play at first (minimal problem). Now the pros, great customization, fair for starters, teamwork is required trying to lone wolf it will get you killed, good music, own kill theme, and NPC's run away when there is gunfire.  There are some other things I want to talk about before I finish, all of the players look the same unless you look at the arrows on their head, as said before, you have to work as a team mainly because this is a team game so you have to stick with the team you have because without them you could be going 5 to 1, and the game will be extremely repetitive so you will get bored within 10 days of downloading it (maybe less) only two types of missions.  This game is a fun experience when you begin playing it and gets boring within a short amount of time, but the amount of fun you can have can be worth it if you really want to invest the time.  7/10
2805	1	a	this game is for sure one of the best games ive played i would recommend it to people who like mmorpg games and people who likes action games and free roming without doing missions it has great quality and the sound is perfect the only problem i have is i wish there were more districts.
2512	1	a	this is a must get game with lots of fun action 24/7
3074	1	a	this is a fun action pack game it is hands down the best PvP game i have played on Steam.
5087	0	a	Terrible Game. Just play ANY GTA.
5743	0	a	I made 3 characters, 2 of them were Criminals, 1 of them was a enforcer. When i played the game i would play with one of my criminals more often with my friends, every time i did i would always die from a higher level player. Me and my friends never won a game, one of my friends decided to buy a weapon with real money way better than the rest of us. And we still got rekt. I dunno why the developers of this game dont make better matchmaking and servers with low levels. Although when i played with my enforcer, i found a group of hackers and i joined them and had fun. For the first time in APB Reloaded i had fun. Then i realized that the only way you can be able to actually play this game is if you are willing to give up your hard earned cash or hack the game.
1316	1	a	Yes. but be prepared for certain pay to win aspects if the game, overall though great game
1377	1	a	BEST GAME EVER !!  Runs awesome  plays awesome  
9650	0	a	Ive seen more functional trailer park families than this game.
9744	0	a	no word to desscribe this ****ing game i take the download then a download in game that take 6 each
10768	1	a	Fun game to play once u get the hang of it. The only problem people might have is the fact that its a perma death game.
3571	1	a	It didn't changed much in the last few years. I had a lot of fun playing this game 2 years ago :) I played it like 500 hours on both sides and it was the best F2P open world action game that I've ever played in my entire life. The best thing in All Point Bulletin is the possibility of custimazation. You can change your car painting, your kill music that your victims will hear after death, your character (almost like in the sims)  Right now it seems that APB is dying a little cause of only 2k people playing at the same time. I hope somedays they will renew that old masterpice for the new players :)  Otherwise I'm recommending this game to people who don't mind that there are just few servers.
2640	1	a	Its only good to hack in, dont waste your G1C because they will ban you for no reason anyways. infact dont waste your time and internet downloading this peice of â¥â¥â¥â¥.
243	1	a	One of my favorite free to play games.   Game is free to play action shooter. Playing feels like GTA but in multiplayer world with 2 teams war. You can play policeman or criminalist and fight together in missions around the city. You can customize your cars, characters, weapons, clothes and many other things. You can also level up your characters with missions. With money which you earn from missions you can buy cars, weapons, ammo, clothes, perks and a lot of other things depends on which level you are. As most of free to play games, this game is also 'pay to win'. Because it's free it also has a lot of hackers.  Developers are pretty active and they are constantly supporting and updating game. They have also improved anti cheat system.  I reccommend this game to everyone who like open world action shooter multiplayer games. It's free to play so grab it and try it because you won't lose nothing. Also playing with friends is really fun. 9/10
9020	1	a	this is like a fallout with an mmo aspect. though to be honest there is a bit of leveling needed to go out there and explore. the crafting system wont seem as bad at first(as there are wait times for crafting items),but when you get to atvs and cars, pop a squat and go play fallout on a console for about 6 hours to see if a peice of your car is finished, or just go to bed, either one.  if they console ported this game, i would play it.   #still better than dayz
10583	1	a	I came for the sheep.
7931	0	a	pay 2 win, poor match making system, lags alot, bad shooting mechanics, time consuming for weapon/mods/vehicle that lasts days   the only + is the character creation system! the character customization is dope! the ability to create your own music tracks! the ability to create your own logos, the art customization is great! but it aint enough to save it
562	1	a	Fun game at times. Friendly community. Bad thing about this game is smurfing and its pretty much P2W. Doesnt help new players too much Alternative to GTA
1480	1	a	i havent played it yet
8108	0	a	Cool Graphics but it's bad game and very laggy !
6289	0	a	Great game idea, bad base players all out for themselves, devs are just wanting money shame could of been a great game and a bigger success if it was put on the right course.
3361	1	a	One word, ruthless. APB can be spectacular and awesome one moment, and frustrating as hell the next, amazing levels of customization in a game thats just like GTA, if you can get over the occasional hacker and the childish members of the community you are in for a treat, if not then dont play APB, go pet some kittens instead :p
9891	0	a	wtf is this
9602	0	a	Downloaded it because I saw so many good reviews. Was a bit dissapointed and I think the game is overrated.  Would've been decent 10 years ago, but now there are other, better games.
1820	1	a	Absolutely SIK M8
10803	1	a	helo is nice gaem with litel bit chalenche, is god but also bad, is nice i like i rate 4/5 bananas
2457	1	a	APB (All Points Bulletin), the first online game developed by David Jones, the creator of the Grand Theft Auto franchise, is a massively multiplayer online game based in living, breathing cities that will feel familiar to players, as they precisely replicate famous cities all over the world. APB is a turf war involving two main factions, the Squads, whose goal is to uphold the law, and the Gangs, who seek to break the law at all costs. Players will be able to choose their side, in a classic good guy versus bad guy scenario.
300	1	a	Best Free2Play Game ;)
9219	0	a	At least the uninstall button works well
9167	0	a	never play
4792	0	a	I have been playing the original APB Beta and the final product and i have to say the game got worse.   - You cant permanently purchase weapons. You are only able to buy them for 10 days each which honestly does my head in. This punishes every player who is not willing or able to sink in 3-4 hours daily.   - The social district is way to confusing. Back in the days of the original APB there where those Customisations stands all over the place, you literally could not miss them because there was at least one of each kind in every building. Now there are one of each in the whole drisrict and finding them is a paine in the â¥â¥â¥â¥ because there are no markers or directions.  - Matchmaking is nonexisting. I had to play against several groups of R200+ players who all where equipped with premium gear whhile i myself have been R20 and my teammates even where lower on level. What is the point of this? Nobody can tell.  - The same lag issues that where in the Beta of APB are still present in APB: Reloaded. The best example is how unresponsive the vehicles are. You litterally have to turn a second early because the car takes about a second to recognise your input even on a server that displays to have a 60ish ping.  I could go on and on about how badly executed APB: Reloaded is. But let me put all that into a single sentance. The game is worse than the Official Beta of APB has been and the beta ended about 4 years ago.  Dont waste your time on it and mor important dont waste any money on it.
908	1	a	  It's really the little things that ruin this game, it's so good but so bad. Every time I play this game I can't help but think that maybe, just maybe g1 and reloaded would care enough to make this game what it was supposed to be. I recommend this game to anyone who loves customization. The gameplay is nice too and the community is split between real nice people and the ones who are salty as hell. In the end, just give it a try it's free after all. ^u^
1343	1	a	Great Game
8830	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ and â¥â¥â¥â¥ :)
4617	0	a	Like every 'Free to Play' Game out there, today. You get a bunch of fedora sporting, neckbearded fat â¥â¥â¥â¥s and spoiled kids spending their mommy's money or their benefits checks on overpowered â¥â¥â¥â¥ for their characters. Just as soon as you start playing, you're constantly â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ in every direction by unbalanced weapons and rockets and all you get is a two inch â¥â¥â¥â¥ of a weapon that does nothing. The cars control like you're on ice, even when those cars look like they're your typical front-wheel drive rice burner from Fast and the Furious or an All Wheel Drive supercar. If you want a game that you can play for free, don't waste your time and save your money on a better game. Seeing games like this is no wonder that they get bombarded by hackers and trainers.
4066	0	a	A great potential â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up by its devs. What a waste of a good game...  EDIT: came back after 4 years to see what happened to this game.  Less players, more hackers, more pay2win G1 slaves, the same exploits and bugs from 2012, a few new guns and cars but not new gamemodes or important updates, ... My suggestion: Don't even try this game, it was a bit playable back in 2012 but now it's just impossible.
9453	0	a	is it bad? i dont know

Dies.  If you're going to insist on taking the game away from Steam and have you're own Client to handle updates/updating/installs, then I suggest you fix it quick.  Featured on Steam... Game is broke.

10114	1	a	The best mission-threads of any MMO I've ever played. Post-Nuke Bliss! ...but eventually PVP is going to rear its head, so be forewarned, if that's not 'your cup of meat'. I give it 8 out of 10, and no one gets a 10
2338	1	a	is so epic game try to play that so epic!
4113	0	a	I personally didn't like it. It was very confusing and I didn't know what was going on a lot of the time. I felt like I was forced into quests when I had no clue what to do. Not only that, but the lag was horrible. Everything mixed together and made a very bad experience for me and I was discouraged to play again and because of that I never played it again so I just uninstalled it. Thankfully it's a F2P, so if you want to give it a try, I won't stop you.
3092	1	a	An absolute and horrid waste of time if you're looking to play something for fun. Cheaters, griefers, whiners and a horribly mismatched matchmaking system. Lag even in the same state as the server, a community typical to free MMO's (children and trolls), and a frustrating grind for simple items.  If you can get past all the negatives, the game has a decently fun fighting system when it isn't pitting you against a horribly imbalanced enemy; the customization is absolutely wonderful, if not lacking in just one or two things; and there's a little bit of charm to the characters and their backstories.  By the way, this isn't a game for lower spec computers.  In general, if you have the patience to deal with â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t after â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t, or can aim very well... This is a great game
1729	1	a	I very much recommend this game to anyone really, it's a very fun game indeed and has a excellent player-base in my opinion. There may be a few bugs and lag issues but the fun content in the game makes up for al that. 5/5 stars!
9783	0	a	Free2Play Free2Unistall
6974	0	a	I can't even get in the game 
6602	0	a	Awful game. A lot of glitches to exploit and matchmaking is just awful. Let's not forget the game breaks almost every time you start up so you have to repair it constantly. When I first started playing the game I thought it was pretty good, but the glitch exploits like standing on a moving car and shooting rockets so you don't have a chance protecting the vip started getting old. Also people not in the misson ram and flip you so the people on the other team can kill you.
10096	1	a	THIS GAME IS THE BOMB! I love it soo much. It's a hardcore MMORPG! Its a good RPG because it takes along time to beat it. Ive been playing for a month and im only a level 8. Might seem like it sucks, but it doesnt. Its not like COD or fallout where you pick your stats when you level up. You earn AP for doing stuff. AP can be used to select your stats if you just have leveled up, or when ever! Also the game has alot of missions. It keeps you strapped to your seat. I love the crafting system. Its just so cool and keeps you looking for bits and doodads. You can also get cars, atv, dune buggies, and horses. You can get pets also! So far I have a Axe, Golfclub, air rifle, dual .357 magnums, dual crude shivs, and dual metal plumbing pipes. Those are my weapons. I also have a old nag as a horse. 1/10 scale i would rate it 9/10. Has good everything except that it takes forever to get a veichle. Also the servers can lag and some missions aren't playable unless you restart. I RECOMMEND THIS!!!!
10077	1	a	look i played this game for the 1rst time and i hated it.but then i realised that i was being an â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and treating this game like our modern f2p shooters.But once i started 2 play it and treat it like how its supposed 2 be pllayed it was awesome !!!!!!
2189	1	a	is a cool game it looks like SR3
4348	0	a	This game is one huge piece of greedy â¥â¥â¥â¥. All it does is steal money from you to give to some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s working from their mom's basements making fun at everyone.  Don't in a gazillion years buy this game or anything made from these â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s.
7131	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game...they say : ' Apb Reloaded need at least 2gb of ram and 4 gb recomanded ' i gave 2 gb ram..and i can run it ... ok ... :/
2336	1	a	It has nice graphics and all but the citizens are wierd lookings has a lot of bugs like the bug that i have that its like a screen multi color thing but i reccomend it
139	1	a	nice gameplay
10492	1	a	Simply the best free to play game on the market.  Think Fallout vs Madmax and you are pretty near what the games is... but in my opinion it's got more Fallout to the flavour than Madmax, espeically when you see the Brotherhood of Steel clan running around RPing.  The world is huge, the quests are fun, and the crafting is 2nd to none. Crafting which is the benchmark of any MMO to date. Everything, well 99% of items are player made.  Play 1st person or 3rd person, live combat with head shots that have to be aimed and a full and exotic levelling of your character. Just a huge onion where layer upon layer you open.  But the emptyness of the world is so relaxing and cathatric, where hugh swathers of the map are exactly what a wasteland should be. NPC areas are rich of people and often where you'll see people and the live chat is still active for the endless questions for the game as it's depth is not reached just with the tutorial.  It's often it's depth which is so alluring, with the game systems opening up by discover and with the levelling being so statisfying, the only question you'll need to answer is do you have a free hour of your life to test out the game. As with free to play, what's there to loose, and what a discover of a forgotten game you'll find.  A rare gem in the grass, not quite a polished diamond, but nonetheless priceless in a market full of carbon copy fantasy MMOs, buy to win games and games that are instantanced.   Fallen earth is fully open world with no loading, and for that, mega props to the dev team. My hat goes off to you.
5925	0	a	Absolutely horrible introduction  Just the fact you dont know â¥â¥â¥â¥ about what youre doing makes this game a no go

When I finally got the game going properly I was completely at a loss for what to do and none of the other players were of any help. Overall 2/10, bad community, bad game.
4831	0	a	In this game, the graphics really remarkable game, but I want you to beat down the ....  But while the game continues to bounce phenomenon has come  Motivated to abandon the game makes this game hydroponic
1032	1	a	its nice.. I'd recommend people to try it considering its free also.
1730	1	a	Even though this game can get to you it is still a fun game to play for hours. Anyone that has played it once can't stop.
6652	0	a	horrible, i hate it honestly.
6500	0	a	So I once had a good review of this game, but I have to change it I'm afraid.  I have well over 400 hours into the game (Played before it was on stea to track my hours) so I'm not someone coming in talking out of their â¥â¥â¥â¥ angry about pay to win.  I have spent money on this game  I have earned a lot of the same stuff outside of spending money  I have leveled both a Crim and and Enf 1 max one close to it.    This game is a shell of its former self, and really there is no game like it still, but you should still look elsewhere. I won't scream hackers, because they've gotten good at banning them, but there are still a few cases where it is far past questionable, especially from the same few people that somehow stick around (I've played long enough to know good from hackker).  I won't say the game is entirely pay to win, and this is coming from someone who HAS paid into the game, but I will say it has gotten damn close, especially the past year. New guns come out that you can only buy, their are not great earning eqvuilanets, and the few that are in some cases can take you as many hours as I have into the game, not including mods, and making the money to rent them constantly.  It isn't a terrible game, but sadly it is run buy a company that seems more focused on their shop than their game. Still the same tired maps this many years later, still the same tired missions that get old and are easily exploitable if you know them well enough (some sides WILL easily win if they are defending/attackin for example). The company running this game seems to have given up on impleneting anything new into the game outside of guns they sell you with real money, and seem to have all but given up on the idea of expanding the game or adding content, which is sad. Game STILL has potentially, simply because no one else does this really, outside of GTA 5 online, but the devs need to realize they are running a game server, not a cash shop.
2794	1	a	i dunno man, this reminds me of Saints Row + Gta
4922	0	a	9/11 Would uninstall again
752	1	a	Fun game once you understand how the high ranks play, although you might bump into one or two hackers.
8556	0	a	Take a good idea, make the game.  Then add pay to win. And then add hackers. And then add toxic community. And then add annoying devs.  There you go, a pile of s***.  But really, this game had lots of potential, fun gameplay, character/vehicle customization, unique gamestyle, unique lore etc.  But G1, just wow, how did you ruin this game at all?  Pay to win : YES! Game is P2W. Compairing the best weapon bought with ingame cash with the one you pay for it. Result? The one you pay for it wrecks everything. Weapons are not cheap, both ingame and G1 store. You won't have a chance (maybe a little) against a guy with a paid weapon.  Hackers : They updated their anti-cheat program. Did it do any good? NO! Still fighting against â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ hackers.  Toxic community : So, you killed someone? Get insulted. You got killed? Get insulted. Left the mission? Get insulted. Was driving around but someone crashed into you? Get insulted. You did nothing? Get insulted. Well, if you want to stay away from rich kids, do not, DO NOT play this game at all.  Annoying devs : Sent few tickets, never got a response or got a trolling one. They see themselves as gods, if you say anything that bothers them, BAM, you get banned.

9409	0	a	fallout meets mmo.  thats about it.  +1 Post-Apoc -1 clumsy control -3 time consuming crafting. and i do mean time consuming. its like EvE on ground. it takes x time to make y item +1 zones are freaking huge -1 other players.... think barrens chat -3 the bugs. oh lordie the bugs. nothing like taking a shot at something and magically what would be a killshot turns into a miss because it moved to the otherside of the screen  so 2/10  i tried to love it
7994	0	a	Great consept. Poor execution. Repetertive, clumsy, dosn't 'capture' the mmo-feeling, not the most interesting world. Milking the cow.
4368	0	a	Came back to this game for the third time and its still the only game i most disrecommend , hey devs how about you use this game to wipe your asses when you finish polishing it which is never going to happen.
8972	0	a	just downloaded this game today, and I can already say its not off to a good start...while it seems like a very fun game, and I couldnt wait to get into it myself..as soon as I started to updater, it prompted the login screen (as to be expected) and it gave me the wonderful option to validate it with my Steam account, just behind a tab that says 'No account data found..If you dont have an account, create one now. Would you like to create an account?' but behind it, you have the option to try and create an account just in case..seems pretty standard, and very easy...so I first tried my steam account, only to be told that the username and password didnt match/werent correct...so I tried my steam name in itsself, still nothing...then I decided to take a chance and go ahead and make an account for the games main website, again, a very standard procedure, enter your email and the password you want...type in the random captcha thing to prove your not a spam-bot, then opt in/out for getting emails and newsletters of the site itsself and the original 'by clicking (whatever it is) you agree to the privacy settings and rules' so I clicked it, and now to validate my email!....waiting...still..almost been an hour now and still havent gotten the validation email and I have already tried at least 5 times..if your looking for a good post-biochemical-apocalyptic survival game, from everything I have read and seen..this IS the game to get, especially if your into STALKER or FallOut, but so far..I can easily say, save yourself the hastle..its nearly impossible to get into the game for those who have not made an account or anything yet
5825	0	a	this is bull i cannot play this game

3154	1	a	When I played the Closed Beta in late 2009, it was a really cool game. But when Realtime Worlds, the makers of the game, went down, Gamersfirst took over the game and made it Free-to-play. It is now a pure pay-to-win game with extreme bonuses that are included in the premium membership etc. It's almost impossible to enjoy the game if you're not a premium user.   But hey, give it a try - it's not a bad game afterall!
2273	1	a	It's a great game! really addicting sometimes :P
8227	0	a	Hella fun game at first, but very quickly lost interest because of all the people purchasing super strong â¥â¥â¥â¥ with real money. Felt very pay to play to me.  Upside of the games are that it feels like a funny version of GTA, but more MMOish. Fun gunplay (until you get oneshotted over and over by people with OP weapons)

1739	1	a	I don't know about any of you but I enjoy the game. I haven't found it repetative like others say, but whatever. I would give it 7/10. Just like almost all games, I want to get that one thing and when I finally get it I don't want to play it anymore. So you wait a while and then the game gets fun again.  Describe this game in one word: Co-op
6940	0	a	Pay 2 win. Dont even play it. Its not 'Free To Play'  Not willing to spend? Dont install

3750	0	a	  After two years of playing this game, I have finally come to a point in which I can review it in full for what it is. And to be truthful, the positives are beginning to fade leaving merely negatives.     APB: Reloaded is a shadow of its former self in many regards, and these days is a shambling mess that won't warrant attention for much longer. With a dwindling playerbase and a greedy publisher, things have been turning sour as of late. Years ago during the original APB, the game looked and performed better for what it provided. Sure, it was a mess back then and it still is now. But some aspects were better back then, from what I've heard.  As a player who had played the game for well over 2,900 hours, I have experienced just about all there is to be offered by the game. And maintaining my honesty, there's some great potential locked away in this game. The potential for player designed content is stunning, and no other game provides such depth for customization on such a broad scale. Other games like EvE Online might provide an excellent character creation suite, and racing games like Forza (can't recall which one specifically) that have in depth car customization exist... But no other game brings systems akin to those present in other titles all into one MMO. Sounds great, doesn't it? If only it wasn't nearly impossible to get into the game.  Back a couple of years ago when I started playing APB:R, there were times I had to force myself to play to get accustomed to the game. I loved it too much to let it go, but it wasn't doing me any favours because it was (and still is) very harsh on new players. All the new free content is almost exclusively available to high ranking players with lots of experience, or to those who wish to become a wallet warrior using the in game cash shop. Now, to put it bluntly... No, I do not think APB is very Pay2Win. Are there some P2W aspects present in the game? Yeah, there is. But almost all of the things that will affect you in an actual match, things that dictate your performance against other players, can be achieved without dropping a dollar on the game. Most paid items merely exist as a shortcut to something that you can still earn on your own, but it'll take a lot of work to get those items.   But, more on the subject of the game rather than the playerbase; how is it really? Well, it's a glorified version of Cops vs Robbers you used to play as a kid in your back yard when you were a kid. That, and then an insane amount of customization potential. The customization elements are rock solid and very enjoyable to use, and you'd be very surprised with the things that some people are capable of creating in game. But the game... How does it run? Well, poorly. The thing about a lot of people who play Free2Play games is that they aren't usually very wealthy and can't afford much in terms of paid games or a strong computer to play them on. APB tends to perform rather badly for some lower end hardware configurations which frankly kills that part of the market. Unless you have a very high end computer, you best be ready for feeling serious stuttering in game. However the dedicated servers that the game is hosted on are also rather bad. The server hardware is slowly being worked on to be upgraded, but it will take a long time for full deployment of the new hardware. Unfortunately, the new hardware that provides better server quality (not by much) is only high end consumer grade desktop hardware. Not server grade stuff... But consumer grade stuff. Disappointing, really.  The combat in game is somewhat hampered at times due to the condition of the servers, which results in poor hit detection for some people and frequent lag spikes on certain servers with the older server hardware. Driving can also be awkward, as driving in APB isn't like in other games. According to the developers, certain things are bound to the server and you have to interact with the server in order to interact with certain items... Like vehicles. There's an easily noticeable delay in steering and throttle for vehicles as you are technically sending commands to the server to move your vehicle, then waiting for it to confirm those actions and send information back to you for your game to display on your monitor. So to put it briefly, the combat and driving can be rather clunky at times.  All in all though, is the game worth it to try and get into? Currently, it's not quite there. Unless you absolutely adore the customization options available, then it isn't really worth your time to start playing it right now. The amount of headaches you'll have to deal with is a massive turn off for fresh players. Not to mention the community is quite frankly rubbish. There's trolling jerks left and right, along with closet cheaters that mask their cheats as skill in order to make up for their own shortcomings so they can be good at a mere video game. A better time to jump on this game would have been a little over a year ago, but things are improving so it might be new player friendly again sometime soon. Currently the devs are working on updating the core engine of APB: R to make things substantially better from a development point of view, but if they can't make that work and create new content to keep people around... Well, this game won't become the MMO everyone plays and it'll just be another MMO that most people just look at once and say 'nah...'. It's up to you if you want to jump into this game how it is now, as it's rough in a lot of spots but a few things shine so bright.  Game Rating: 7/10 for what the game is capable of, but 5/10 for the community that calls APB:R home.
9154	1	a	This game is put together very well. The updates always add more fun to the overall experience.
8966	1	a	Watched cooking videos, got freemium.  10/10 - IGN
6864	0	a	So the game is getting some serious age right now. Decided to take the game for a spin today, to check if network issues has been fixed. Again!  Took my car for a drive, going to check if I could get to the closest gas station without crashing.  Another player appeared in front of me, driving. None of us didn't even bother to touch the steering wheel, but went flat out crossing our fingers in a head to head collision. This is how bad the lag is.  Unplayable.
6288	0	a	nah not my kind of game
4936	0	a	first i launch it, it won't let me play it so i close it, and it deletes it from my library 1/10000000000 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing good
4138	0	a	A failed uptopia, from its citizens to its infrastructure.  I love this game, and I may sometimes hop on, but I cannot in good conscience honestly recommend it.  +++PROS+++ The basic idea is wonderful. It's an open world city with customized characters pitting cops vs robbers for strategic operations and car chases.   This game is known for its vast customization. The Player Characters' bodies are customizable, tattoo-able, clothing customizable, cars customizable, theme songs, equipment, weapons.   The style of the non-player content is very attractive, a motion graphic setting a metropolis plagued by stylish punks; even the corporate executives are stylish.   If you're bored of killing, you can spend hours customizing or you can scrape some money up robbing places, catching robbers, stealing and returning cars. There are other things to do than missions.  It is not a pay to win game. Paying players will have some advantage, but it's really not a problem.  I'm going to go ahead and put the game's city in the Pros section. The cities do feel half alive. When I'm in the game, I feel like I'm in a city, not a backdrop of buildings, as I felt in Borderlands. There are plenty of stores, shops, apartments, places cities would need, and civilians walking around. The civilians are walking talking dolls that interact minimally, but it is just barely enough to make the city feel alive as I'm cruising in my car, looking at these 'civilians.' I do, however, wish the player contacts would interact with players more; they truly are cardboard cutouts, even with some of their dialogue.  ---CONS--- The game runs horribly. I'm no tech wizard, and I do have an old laptop, but for a game of this age with this level of texture and model quality, it's odd that I'm lucky if I can get any steady 10-15 frame rate at all.   This game is not especially well designed for the strategic action that was intended.  The levels are not perfectly balanced. There are only two city districts to play missions in, the main content of the game. The mission objectives are often in siege points of cqc mazes, surrounded by vast open areas; the enemy can see you coming from any direction, especially if they know the game's spawn points and routes well, and even if you manage to close the distance, they'll be waiting for you with cqc weapons ready. There aren't a lot of ways to flush enemies out of a siege position, other than being high leveled and affording grenade launchers.  The game's action is fast; characters are pretty zippy, compared to real life anyway. So, like Counter-Strike, this game gives strong favor to physical skills, reflexes and aim. Strategy and brainpower can help greatly, but a player can more easily brute force their way and kill enemies from disadvantaged terrain than they could in Ghost Recon Phantoms or even TF2.   Cover is used in this game minimally, you're obviously better off behind cover than in the open, the game does not really encourage strong use of cover. Cover is generally only provided in those cluttered maze like cqc areas. On the street, there is no cover except for exploding cars that do not protect your feet. In cqc areas, cover is less used because the fights are dances between two players with fully exposed hitboxes. There are short time limits on the missions, so players cannot wait around too long, especially if a fast moving enemy is patrolling the area. Once you get into cover to face an enemy at range, there's not a lot you can do to leave cover, as there is not a web of cover to leapfrog to and you don't have a lot of grenades and you don't have time for the coordination required for suppressive fire.  Teamwork is needed, but not really emphasized. Because of the low team sizes, teams are better off splitting up to attack from multiple angles. Being so far away from each other, players tend to act on their own; the only way to coordinate a team adequately is with a microphone; there is nothing to rally players together. Players do not need each other as all players have just about the same abilities; this is not TF2, where classes have strengths and weaknesses and are rallied by a medic.  The matchmaking is horrid. The game sets up some pretty unfair matches. Part of this is due to the low population, which is no doubt thanks to the game's problems and lack of aid to new players. And as you climb the ladder in skill, you will eventually find yourself constantly losing against the players at the top of the ladder, who never lose; they are lethal at all distances with an assault rifle and have the money to spam missiles and grenade launchers if they want to.   You win some you lose some, but all these things add up for too many moments where you'll have to learn the humility to surrender, knowing there was nothing you could do. Or if you do finally kill the guy who has been killing you over and over again, it was because of the luck of the aim rather than you being smarter. You just keep throwing yourself like water at a stone.   The community is horrid.   There are a lot of cheaters.  The game is an MMO. MMO's must constantly release new content until they eventually die out. This game is in its old age and it's handled by a small team that cannot release new content as often as needed. Even if they did, it wouldn't fix the base problems of the game.
10601	1	a	2012 review: AMAZING game!!! First ever truly FREE game, where supporting the creators doesn't give you an unfair advantage. Very good game!  2016: So yea.. that was awhile go wasn't it? Alot has changed.... for the worse. The game is not truly 'free' anymore, there are numerous pay2win factors in the game. The game is still good and fun at times but it has some serious issues.   I pretty much quit, I come online now and then to run a couple dungeons and then I'm off. Sometimes I go for longer when I decide to stream abit. I feel like this game does not deserve any players and should just die off already. What kabam is doing to the players and the game is horrible.  From reading the forums you see alot of people that are done with the game. They either want to quit or ask questions about the longevity of this game. And there's certain people that keeps feeding the community this idea that as long as you support the game (buy gold) it will not shut down. Now maybe this is correct, but I dont think we should promote and feed such a company. They have literally done nothing for the past like year? No new content or adaptations of dungeons, no promised changes. And dont even bring up the 'that was another team'. If they trash ideas, communicate this. It's ridiculous how infested with cheaters this game is. I bet over 50% of the players are cheaters or have cheated at one point to build up their accounts. Not to mention the game being overrun with multiboxers.  I think people go easy on kabam because of their love for this game.  The game is good and enjoyable. But it is also an MMO, and such games require maintenance and regular updates to keep stuff fresh and exciting. I'm getting the same vibes when hacking first became visible widely and people just basically ignored it because it did not hurt them. And look where we are now. Yes they have put on some sort of fix for event notifiers. But not after ALOT of complaints, we can wake them up if we really want them to.  I'm truly amazed at the people that can still religiously play this game every day. How do you not become bored after an hour? Is it because you are addicted? Have nothing else to play? Because trust me, there are ALOT of great games out there with developers that DO care.  Of course we do not KNOW what is up with kabam, maybe they are rewriting the entire game? But the fact remains, there is no communication whatsoever. And they've basically let the game run on autopilot.  So if you want to play a bullet hell, permadeath mmo then by all means play this game. The game is still good and you can do fine without buying gold. But I will also tell you to not get invested in this game, it honestly does not deserve your time. Once you've reached the endgame stuff will become stale rapidly. If you can endure the cheaters and multiboxers and lack of communcation/updates from the developers that is.  DECA has taken over from Kabam now. So far it seems to be going in the right direction. They have fixed a duping exploit fairly quickly and made some additions to the game suggested by the players. Let's hope they keep this up.

4021	0	a	FreeToPlay GTA... With bugs,bad optimisation,graphics,money greedy... Go away already..
4529	0	a	This game is a pretty standard example of how to milk a game for all it is worth using already existing assets.  I was an original player from back when the game was owned and run by Real Time Worlds (R.I.P) and published by EA. I was one of the first batch of players to play APB Reloaded during the closed beta period. After open beta is began it's continuous downward spiral.  Pros - Customization, it's nearly unmatched in the options for customizations  Cons - Poor community and lack of in-game moderating; griefers, hackers and inappropriate behavior that isn't punished. - Dominated by in-game microtransaction system; you'll rarely find people that play consistently who don't spend money in some form. It's not impossible to play without paying, takes a noticeable amount of time for it to be worth it. - Unoptimized. - Poor matchmaking; back during closed beta there weren't districts that were divided by 'threat level', so often times higher ranked players would get matched against many more people than were in their group. I consider that a step up to what is currently in the game. - Poor spawn system; pretty easy to push on a spawn so the enemy spawns farther away, and car spawners have completely ruined the dynamic of the game.
5461	0	a	Tried to be gta, failed.
8856	0	a	This over all in build is a nice game really cool build and art makeing sytem to it.  But but the biggest problem so over looked is the pay to win if you pay for the over tope guns and then go to the low level zone its eays picking wich kills off new players really unless you have too much money in game and levels also there is no real balnce to the game what so ever.  In the end this game will make you rage quit its a love hate kind of one i hope one day the dev team for APB will think about fixing the problems and working on other elements too.
552	1	a	This game's pretty neat
239	1	a	i have had fun on this game but now it keeps crashing!!! i will try fix it but yeah...

8497	0	a	doesnt even launch just takes you to a facebook page   EDIT: managed to get past the facebook page issue it launched closed itself out after about a minute then locked up my steam and i cant get rid of it i have no options but to restart my computer to be able to play any real games and delete this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ so in end if you want to break steam download this game and have fun breaking steam i sure as hell didnt
1179	1	a	APB was a bad game to me at first, but then i started to play more hoping it would get better. And It did, the game (in my opinion) is not P2W i have bought single gun, and do better then most of the people i play against. So in overal, the game is really fun, besides the fact that missions are repetitive. The graphics are pretty nice, and really fun if you play with friends Via Skype. So download the game and message me if you want to play together :)
5616	0	a	I think I played this for a long time... Its Pay 2 win with over powerd weapons and car upgrades only avable for payed accses members. If you have a big wallet and time I can recomend this game, But If you have time and no wallet I can tell you that you will have a good time dying all the time.
4089	0	a	this game is dead after new threat system.
10415	1	a	I dont know if people still play this game via steam.but,i do play this game every time every day in my life this is the best rpgo game ever in the world,more than any other games...its should get to top 10 most popular f2p !!
1758	1	a	APB capitalizes on customization, great built-in design tools with lots of stuff to unlock and lots of skimpy non-clothing available for your female avatar's unproportionate â¥â¥â¥. Even though unsubscribed players are limited in how many design elements they can have on each peice of clothing or each vehicle, it still feels functional and fun. Hanging around the social district and seeing the hilariously creative outfits that players design is the most entertaining part of APB. Giving myself a back tattoo that said 'â¥â¥â¥â¥ASS' for all to see provided me with deep satisfaction.  Although the matchmaking and missions are fluid, innovative and fun, the sub-par combat and driving mechanics don't provide a sturdy foundation for all of this glorious and limitless customization to stand on, and it is reflected by its ever-crumbling playerbase.   Play long enough and your 'threat' level increases, putting you at a different matchmaking level to keep games fair and balanced, while at the same time isolating you from an exponentially larger part of the player pool with each rise in threat level. Before long I had reached the highest threat level, and was rewarded with a whopping 2 possible opponents that were currently online to play against. Nice. The most proposed solutions to lowering your threat level to again have fun with the game are to 'lose on purpose' or 'create a new character'... What? Seriously?  I'd like to see customization like this in the next stab at an online GTA-style open world game. APB definitely layed the groundwork for a matchmaking method that keeps everyone in the same world while simultaneously pitting groups of players against eachother. You'll often see fights between other teams going on right next to you.   Cool game overall, although the most fun to be had is in the customization menus and not in playing the game itself.  
2797	1	a	The overpowered paid weapons and occasionally inappropriate match-making cause this game to be unbalanced. Otherwise it's a pretty decent multiplayer shooter and it enables comprehensive avatar making. More fun if playing with friends.
3113	1	a	apb is a really fun game it provides lots of customization and u can go out on the streets of san paro with friends and start doing missions or just fool around its up 2 u.
5764	0	a	I have played a long while without steam since close Beta, all G1 gamers are friendly and F2P.   Till 2013, P2W became hot topic in this game and i totally AGREE those people who invest a lot of MONEY in this game can have HIGH CHANCE TO WIN,  That trigged gamers (most of them are UNMATURE KIDS) tried to use with HACK PROGRAMMES for tricking G1 points and gaming that happened on 3 servers(EU, NA, HK). [Check youtube please, Gamerfirst]  The threat system became a joke for me. FAKE GOLD, HACKER CLAN.  I believe people will change, and game as well,  but it have become worst than what gamers should EXPERIENCE( ENJOYMENT, EXCITMENT and TEAMWORK).  Im sick of the communty with hackers and team killers.  Please someone help this game.
2970	1	a	It's an intersting game. Criminals vs. Enforcers duking it out. It's not an MMO apart from an MMO type lobby. The game is made of closed off matches. It's more of the third person shooter variety than a MMO.
321	1	a	the developers are awful and the game is in a state of never-ending decay.
3928	0	a	(For all of you looking at my 600 hours, I actually have 1000+).  Let me begin by saying that this is a one-of-a-kind MMO that I fell in love with the first time I was allowed into the closed beta. The games character customization blew me away, and quickly became my favorite part of the game, and to this day is the only thing I genuinely care about in terms of APB's overall content.   Combat is a different story. I can't even consider it to be combat much more than I consider it to be dancing. There's just a huge learning curve to this game. Back in the day, people use to jump and snipe. It was the most stupidest thing ever designed into a shooter. The game feels to be a bit ridiculous sometimes, that I just up and quit after about an hour. Along with that, I have a short list of complaints in my head with this game, and I'll just point have you read them here.   1: The community can be sort of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ to new players. Even I at once would badger these 13 year old kids who barely found out what a microphone was, but I learned that it didn't help with anything, except maybe my ego. There are so many new players who just get put down by all the grizzled veterans that they see no reason to continue playing this god-forsaken game, and they would be pulling a smart move. There is a huge lack of motivation to stay in the game, unless of course you meet certain people that you can have a good time with. Even then however, the game makes it very hard to maintain a positive attitude.  #2: I use to part of a team of testers known back in the day as SPCI. It was a group picked by individuals who cared for the game, and also its testers. I admit I didn't do as much as others, but I was there when it came to the problems we faced. For one, whenever an upcoming patch needed testing, sometimes we were limited to only a day to do it. Now for most people, they couldn't test every day of the week, even me. Whoever could took a huge load of work. Once bugs and critical elements were reported, we'd expect G1 to be on top of these reports and fix them. This never ever happened in my experience. Sometimes these bugs wouldn't be addressed for months, sometimes never. It was this lack of action that made a lot of us question if what we were even doing was being appreciated. Eventually it all fell apart. Now there is a new team, whom I don't know, that either care about the game, or just want in on the upcoming content. In layman's terms, the new team to me feels like a bunch of complacant slaves who just want to have some 'imaginary' form of authority in the APB community. So yeah, G1 just needed people to test the game so that they could say they have a test team, and that's it. So far, they don't seem to care.   #3: This game is filled with people who use third-party software to get an advantage in the game (wallhacks, aimbots, etc). Not a single day goes by where I can play and all the opposing players play legit. Most of the time you can tell when your playing excellent players, sometimes it's a very thin line between legit and illegit. It's this thin line that makes people 'hackusate' even legit people, and it even gets legits banned. And even when the illegitimates get banned, there's no preventing them from being able to reroll. They'll just come back to rage-hack and continue being their immoral selves.   #4: This game will bring out the worst in you. It doesn't matter how much willpower you have, how much of a paragon/angel you are. This game will break you, no question. Most of the time, it's this reason people result in becoming illegitimates, because they either want to â¥â¥â¥â¥ on people, or because they don't want to spend the time to get better at something, and will use shortcuts to get their way. For people like me, who take it day by day, it is a struggle we endure for reasons even we don't really know. Maybe we hope for a day when the game will become what we always dreamed it to be. Maybe it's because we invested so much of our time into this game, we can't bare to let it go. The game has introduced me to some really good people, some of whom are good friends that I've known for years now. It's people like them that I wish filled the game, but sadly, the game is full of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s, give or take a few.   #5: The Grind is very VERY real in this game. It is literally a requirement that you have premium from the get-go if you even want to finish this game in a relatively quick amount of time, and unless you like me, who wants to spend nearly 600 hours of gametime getting to R195, your gonna want premium. I have a 1000+ hours on my main character, and he's only 246 at the moment. In the near future, when contacts need even more repect points from you, I might just die of old age.  #6: Teamwork is something that people in this game ignore, which is funny, because it is literally the only thing that wins matches. Playing with a bunch of randoms does not help you in the slightest. Playing with people you know, people your on a voice chat with, is going to win you more games than just immitating a headless chicken (literally running in like a moron, with no strategic plan). So if your going to play this game, make friends fast, or get friends to play with you, so that you can get somewhere rather than nowhere.   In conclusion, this game has a great concept, but it's maintained by a bad company, who's only reason for buying it was to milk the living crap out of it. You'll notice really quick that this game has very little content push, and more flashy â¥â¥â¥â¥ with an expensive price tag on all of it. The clothes I like, but the guns and cars are G1's main source of income. Sometimes I wonder what it would have been like had this game gone back to subscription based playing. I'd compare it to FFXIV, and say that more content would be added rather than ARMAS market items. In a way, I probably would have done subsciption over F2P. But it was never my call to begin with, so for now, I just go with the flow.   My score - 2/5   I still have high hopes for APB, but until then, I am not going to recommend it because it's not fun once the raging begins. If your really willing to punish yourself, learn from your mistakes, and learn to laugh at them as well, because your going in for one hell of a rollercoaster ride.   Word of warning: Be prepared to get â¥â¥â¥â¥ on when you play.   On a side note, they should add some PVE to this game. Would help me relax a bit.  Along with that, enforcer activities (raiding a den, gathering intel, arresting drug dealers, etc.)
4047	0	a	IM not playing no more they need match player with them same ranks and they need to kick all the hacker of the game.The game it not worst playing at All.All they care is your money not anything else.And they never respond to your complaints!!!!!!!!!
3682	1	a	the best game ever I think everybody will like it :} 
2168	1	a	It's a really bad game that I happen to like.
1461	1	a	very good game, no frame drops and no problems... + amazing hitreg
6966	0	a	You want to have fun in a good,bugless, multiplayer sandbox? buy GTA V
1533	1	a	the only game where you can dress up as a teenage mutant ninja turtle driving in a jurassic park car game of the year 2076
2235	1	a	Great for shenanigans, as in screwing other players over, by exploding the cars or ramming them over with larger size trucks.  Used to run great before, now i just can't for some reason.
10261	0	a	If your going to play this because it looks like Fallout, don't. It's much much much â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ier.
9174	0	a	Boring, doesnt save correctly
4356	0	a	Have you ever had a moment in your life where you're excited and ready to go? Starting APB was like that for me. I made my character, grabbed a gun, and went out into the world of gang violence.  Much like real gang violence, I was repeatedly brought low by people who bought better weapons than I could, could use the same weapons I had to better effect, and was matched up in a 'fair' fight against people who were like gods to me as an ant. even my car could best be described as a thin plastic shell around a chunk of explosive that functioned as an engine. Within 16 hours of gameplay, I had made every possible worst decision, from choosing a shotgun with the spread the size of a small house, to attempting any sort of PvP at all when close-quarters fighting meant gangbangers instantly ending my life repeatedly with SMGs and sniper rifles, while assault rifles were used to pick opponents off from 100 meters away. Any attempt at buying improved weaponry to escape the hellish catch-22 of ranking up to get new weapons was met with a paywall, and those who bought these rank-exempt weapons were unto demigods in their own right, as these 'same but different' weapons had the characteristics of their real life counterparts. Which, of course, meant they could actually kill you, unlike the peashooters and feather guns regular players are given. All in all, it's the standard Korean MMO pay-to-win format, but with guns and cars. Good if you need to be humbled or have the reflexes of a supercomputer.
2563	1	a	This game is one of the best mmo games in my opinion. It's a third person shooter in the great city of San Paro. This game includes so much customization. You can tune your car, buy some clothes and make music and share it all. You can choose between an enforcer and a criminal with both their own gameplay elements. You can choose various guns out of a huge arsenal of weapons. This game is also free, so don't doubt to download this beauty and try it out yourself.
3888	0	a	dont have money like me? the game become super hard!!!! play it if you pro most people has pay 2 play guns and stuff realy hard to win good luck.  pretty sad you must pay to customise clothes like a normal person  pretty sad you must pay to customise cars at all pretty sad you must pay to have 'Better' guns  this game pretty sad :/ i liked the idea but the pay to play ruined it :(  have money? go ahead and play it!
6322	0	a	BWAHAHAHAHA  HAHAHHAAAHHHEUHEUEHUEHEUHEUE LULZOR  If I wanted to play a shooter with lag I'd be playing another game on a Jupiter server.
2208	1	a	cool game
170	1	a	Fun game ,I play this all the time on and off and enjoy it . There are some player balance problems but overall if you not one who goes completely mental when you lose you will like it. very satisfying when you kill an elite player by hitting them with your car after they ve killed you 10 times.Loads of charater and veichle customisation as well.
2179	1	a	Not The Best Game I've Ever Played, But It Can Still Improve To Be Better :)
9613	1	a	its an awesome free survival game were you can craft stuff,fight zombies , and do missions but the only problem is the tutorial sucks so if there is an option to skip it that would be great :)  
4075	0	a	APB reloaded does not start the game is â¥â¥â¥â¥, DON'T get it
9565	0	a	Absolute trash. The mechanics are just... so... wrong. Aiming feels like i'm using a freaking etch-a-sketch. Then looting seems like it freezes the game? I couldn't even finish the tutorial before i felt nauseous. What else can you expect from the creators of APB... Blech.
4947	0	a	I got perma banned for nothing. Garbage game never want to play again. I do not reccomend anyone to play this, I put tons of money in the game and they banned me for no reason....
9686	0	a	Worst game i've honestly ever played in my life
3683	1	a	Car Smashing Griefing Simulator whichever year. Of course there is more than that to this game. You buy clothes, you buy cars, you buy guns and feel fabulous about yourself, but all that comes with real world money or countless hours spent in this game. Is it worth your time you ask? Well if smashing low tier cars into high tier super cars until they explode until you get reported is your cup of tea, by all means create a bald naked fat guy and go ram everyone in the street. Also cherish the time introducing your friends to the game and finding them as disappointed about the community as you are.
9299	0	a	this game kinda just showed up in my libraray
2402	1	a	Hell of a game. mugging, robbing, and missions. Own this now.
1339	1	a	Great game , epic i can say... it doesn't even feel like a matchmaking game because it's map is so huge that you forget about that part.  Pros : You can create your own designs and apply them on about anything that you own (yea car / clothes / character / weapons , even post graifty on buildings with your own design/picture). Fun to play as hell , at least , at first. Cons: Lag , lag , lag , lag , then something amazing happens ( yea no more lag) and then again , lag lag lag lag.... The low ammount of hackers is still annoying. Pay to win. Even a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ one can produce a killing spree with a bought weapon , so you may have an idea on how overpowered are the premium weapons. Also , premium players get x3 more rewards than a normal player does. So meh , if P2W isn't a problem for you , then you may enjoy this alot! It is pretty hard to at begining at least. And the game is free so meh , i guess i should not complain about negative parts , to much.
6058	0	a	its a â¥â¥â¥â¥ game
6167	0	a	Well, first of all... the game is great, the only problam is when I try to exit, and its a big problam. I have a computer with exactly the recommended system requierments but it still crashes... (blue screen /:)
5161	0	a	This game in its current state is complete and utter trash, along with its dwindling community. I'm not even going to THINK about touching this game ever again until they release the updated engine, if they ever even decide to release it. This game was a blast to play in its hay day, but it went downhill quick. Give me my APB back, I really do miss it. Unfortunately I'm going to have to give this game a bad review until they update it.
877	1	a	it is very fun.
7621	0	a	I'm playing on a 2500 dollar game rig that was built within the last 6 months. With my setup this game plays for â¥â¥â¥â¥. I can barely get 20 fps during combat. Customisation is amasing, though. I hear it's p2w, but I can't confirm as I can't really play it.
1963	1	a	The gameplay and customizing in this game is incredible I have played since the beta and I will always love this game
9865	1	a	EAT THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥ ITS GOOD
5173	0	a	This game just will not behave. I made an account before I downlaoded it, launched it and logged on useing the account I made. Then it said it was invalid, so I made another account, and THAT did not work, then a third, and months later I downloaded it again, useing all three acounts to login with, and all of them were invalid. It is still like that, and I did not get an email for my roblem yet when I sent in a report, so I do not reccomend this game...
8800	0	a	This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥, please dont, just dont.
7926	0	a	Played it for a while, it was ok and then realized players on your team will hinder you so you dont win (assuming to help level up their friends on the other side). Wasnt even worth the download!
7184	0	a	All I see in Merry Elfin' Christmas. I feel like I should just go back to fantasy MMOs. Also, I cannot find my pants.  &gt;1/10
9355	0	a	ITS HORRIBLE THE GRAPHICS DO NOT EXIST LIKE THE WORLD IS NOTHING BUT A WHITE BOTTOMLESS PIT ITS A WASTE OF GIGS!!!
5539	0	a	It would be a good game if it wasn't pay to win
3273	1	a	APB is very fun its kinda like Gta mixed cops and robbers and car chases but it as its limits once you rasie a mentor to level 10 and get the clothes you want your pretty much done with the game its really fun when you play with your friends it also has a free roam around city there are 2 diffrent cites and a social area for changing your clothes i think they could of made this game a little better and give it more free stuff to do in the city I rate this game out of 10 7/10
2813	1	a	Very fun, you can creat a lot of stuff for your cars or your own outfits and it's a Shooter, what do i have to say more exciting than that? :D
10432	1	a	I love crafting systems. Man, do I ever love good crafting systems in game. And what better then a game about the post apocolyse to really shine in this department? There is nothing quite as rewarding as savaging through mounds of garbage, collecting various long rusted do-dads, and long forgotten whats-its to make various deadly weapons to gut, barrage, or otherwise eviscerate various pus drooling mutants.  Okay, so the crafting is still varily limited. But compared to most MMORPGS it is still rather 'up there' on the scale of awesome. Combine that with real time FPS combat (which still boils down to a-typical pulling and grinding, admitably) and you got yourself some fun times.  The game is rather graphic intensive, but after kicking the graphics down even my laptop with it's outdated drivers and such was capable of running it releatively smoothly. Grab a friend, get your horse and hit the waste! It's time to launch your career as a down and dirty, gun toting scavager!
9849	1	a	Pretty good
7019	0	a	No gametime, it installed several things into chrome and even more dissapointing, it doesn't launch!   0/10 Everyone On The Internets
9398	1	a	this game is nice when textures are rightt 
3282	1	a	+ It's a nice game with decent graphics, and multiplayer. + Alot of nice vehicles, some new would be nice though. + The customization is out of this world, i have never seen a better one + Driving is fairly easy once you get the hang of it. + The game contains some nice tunes in it, that you can access anytime with P. + It's free for play, and not pay to play. + Premium is a nice touch, only that it's pricy, would love some more free premium days! - The matchmaking system is â¥â¥â¥â¥, you end up with gold threat even though you are silver, and if you are gold you end up with noobs. - You usually end up with stupid teammates, and ofcourse they have the worst gun and can't aim. - Griefers with trucks, they ram, slam and kabam you into buildings making you explode &gt;:(. - People speaking other languages in chat even though it's EN server. - Waterfront seems a bit grey, try adding more colour to it. - The 'Whisper' is to OVERPOWERED and should be taken off the game.  i give it a 6/10 :)

4836	0	a	I have spent countless hours on this game wasting a little over a thousand dollars on it (I'm crying) and everything was great until Fairfight was introduced now this isn't the same Fairfight from battlefield, this is the $5 version of Fairfight, basically what it does is it bans you from hack reports and your K/D ratio so if you do good your going to get reported for 'hacking' and you will get banned.. that's what happpened to me now for the sake of your life don't play this game!
2084	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing owns
2324	1	a	Hit the streets as a licensed vigilante or hardened criminal in the crime-ravaged metropolis of San Paro where shootouts, car-chases, robbery, and vandalism are all in a day's work. Prove yourself to your chosen organization and you could earn fame, deadly weapons, exotic vehicles, and stylish new clothing; fail.But is too cool
592	1	a	this game is pay 2 win if you want to level up only with G1 Credits  i dont say we have pepole that dont buy G1 Credits and they succses in this game but mostly you need to buy G1 Credits because the weapons there is OP = over power..  so have fun and dont spent a lot of money :D  
10477	1	a	I &lt;3 you G1. And this game is rather monotonous. Still nice though. Instead of sleeping pills or such. Works.
570	1	a	Had the best moments with my friends. Rage moments , Funny moments , i recommend this game because is just awesome. But the community is not so good. Have fun with it !
3394	1	a	The game does have it's flaws but overall it is one of those games where you can troll other people and have a decent time with friends. Like to â¥â¥â¥â¥ people off? Well this is the game for you but warning! Other players are just as good at trolling, even better at times. So eat tacos and let the bodies hit the floor.
708	1	a	UPDATED REVIEW AGAIN: Once Again
9168	0	a	i know i have no play time for this game but that is exactly why im writing this review. let me start from the begining, i wait 2 days for this game to download(slow internet) and its done so i start the game and it asks me to create a account so i go and fill in all the required stuff and wait for the verification email, get the email and open link, then i get a error, this page cannot be found, so i redo it again and same problem, tried at least 4 times, keep getting the same error. now i see why it has so many negative reviews
2631	1	a	FUN need fast internet to be able to play 
2565	1	a	Most of the time it wont work
9428	1	a	If there was a fallout online, and it had a massive dump, this game would be that dump.   Good community, once you reach the areas they hang out in. When you start, the game will put you clean off and you may very well quit. It has massive maps, and the starting map is very empty, you'd be forgiven for thinking the game was about to shut down due to no players. I quit the first time i played, but if you keep at it, you'll locate the player community on the third section.   I got a good few hours in the game, I really enjoyed the clans and the big drama they all love to cause. You'll find the Devs are friendly and you get to know them after a while.  give the game a try, hell it's free so why not.

8430	0	a	Great Game. One of the game that has held my attention the most. Played it for 2 years...  But, When that is said.. It has also been the most expensive game ever. And its a FreeToPlay!   The game offers a wide varity of guns, advantages, clothing and bodykits for cars = If u got the money.  I would understand if Premium was the only cost ingame. But taking money for 60% of ingame features is just wrong.  The itself is great, but the community is rude and lacks co op, The game is full of hackers, And its a Pay2Win game.   Not just Pay2Win, but Pay2Havefun...   GamerFirst really destroyed a great game.
4674	0	a	 A genuinely awful game.
6225	0	a	1 word. No its 3 words i think  PAY TO WIN
9687	0	a	The graphics need updating MASSIVELY and the gameplay is boring. Not fun.
10820	1	a	The kind of game that makes you cry when you die
9696	0	a	I like the part where launcher does 1kbs update download. â¥â¥â¥â¥ this â¥â¥â¥â¥
2339	1	a	its like an mmo gta. the missions are challenging. and it is 110% necessary to use teamwork. ive only been playing for a little while but i love it.  my only problem is the premuim option. i feel that some of the stuff that is not available to f2p player gives little rich kids an unfair advantage.  but the game is truly amazing :)
7587	0	a	This is like the really bad version of gta online 
108	1	a	The game's customs is what makes it fun. The gameplay you have to have patience with your self and the game, cause if you dont you will get tired of it real quick. Other than that the game is MAD fun XDD
6921	0	a	This game is an MMO. If that doesn't tell you what you should expect, probably stay away. If you like dying over and over again, this might be the game for you. I don't, which is why I'm glad I didn't pay for this. Frankly, this is not a review of the game so much as it is of the genre and the community. If you're the kind of person who can keep interest in this sort of thing long enough to get good, my review should mean nothing to you.  As for the rest? The people like me who joined too late/couldn't get the hang of it, and were thus deprived of all the fun this game had to offer? Well, if you're like me, you got interested in this based on style, color, and rampant, light-hearted brutality. You can find all that, plus a single-player or co-op environment that wants you to experience it, in the Saint's Row series. Saint's Row the Third and Saint's Row IV in particular are the closest to what I wanted out of APB. And go ahead and get the full package for the games as well, if you can. Having a tank right out of the tutorial sequence was EXTREMELY helpful and fun in 3.
2392	1	a	wow much shooter
6194	0	a	not works and when its work it crash
9590	0	a	do not download youll update and wait to load more then play
7693	0	a	Just terrible. I played it for 20 mins and deleted it when I realised it's just a tacky rip off of GTA.
1118	1	a	im in love. 20/10 would run over, mug, murder innocent civilians again!
9857	1	a	If you enjoy large-world games this may be one for you. The crafting system is large and complex and the dusty plains provide a very fitting frame for the story. There's the option of going for missions or crafting as you level up, either way will make your character progress as you play. The GUI was daunting at first but after a few hours it felt more comfortable to use - but never easy or intuitive. As it stands now I'm on the verge of putting real money into the game, since I feel the developers have created a world that pulls me where other post-apocalyptic games have had a plastic, artificial feel to them. If you enjoy exploration and crafting, definitely try out this free to play version at the very least!
9364	0	a	The game got boring pretty quickly, I'm not sure if I like the story line or not. But if you are the type of person who loves apocalyptic games, you should try this one out to see if you enjoy it, but there's a high chance you will be disappointed. IMO, this game is not for me.
1347	1	a	I personally like being able to customize everything in the game the way that i want, plus i really feel like i am the criminal trying to get away with crimes, and watching out for the cops so they don't catch us
922	1	a	Fun,Buitefuk Graphics and awesome gameplay but pretty reapitve So i dont suggest this so much, but it is A fun game :D --------TRY IT OUT-------- problems : Are u lagging much like me like 25 - 18 fps then u should make the graphics really ugly Sorry D:
9792	0	a	no good .THE SKIES is better than this.
3352	1	a	Love it, I hate it, but thats why this game is so much fun, you can be losing and the next moment TABLES ARE TURNED, GUN FIRE ALL OVER THE PLACE TEAMMATES BLOWING EACH OTHER UP AND YOUR SUDDENLY WINNING. WATCHOUT ITS A GARBAGE TRUCK READY TO GREIF YOU BADLY...   got carried away there for a moment, but thats how this game makes me feel. its too fun and addicting.  I give thumbs up cause I've been playing for a long while now :) and once you get far in ranking its really enjoyable  Pros: you can meet some pretty interesting people on here and teamwork is vital which is the success to this games team vs team  cons: needs to get rid of the bots and ghosters, and G1 needs to be more truthful and up to date with there releases... still waiting on the engine update.. :( otherwise this is my first longest review, hope you all enjoyed my input...
9638	1	a	this game isnt actuallt free to play :( 
8312	0	a	My ex boyfriend had me play this with him. I'm not really into shooter games or anything except Half Life and similar stuff, and back then I didn't even have interest in Half Life. So you can imagine the culture shock I went through when I finally installed this game. He had us play as thieves and I must say now that I look at it it's like an MMO version of GTA. For me, everything we did didn't sit right with me and every time we encountered anyone else all they wanted to do was either shoot us or run us over with a car. From what I remember you're stuck being a gruff looking human and the only customization after making your character is expensive clothing at overcrowded stores. And from what I could tell, everyone played the game like an idiot, unable to drive without aiming at people/fences and if they were the police, all they did was shoot at you until you were dead. I don't even know if that's how they're even supposed to do their job because I never got the chance to play as one as I got fed up with trying to play something that I really didn't like.  TL;DR: If you like to go 'LOOOOOLLLLL â¥â¥â¥' then this game is perfect for you and you will find everyone else in there to be like you. If you're any other person with an actual sense of decency, you more than likely will hate it and its community.
3587	1	a	Wont open, crashes whenever I try to play. rip.  Though what i've heard from my close friends, it's basically GTA for free, which is nice.
10401	1	a	The title has nothing to do with the earth falling through space.  10/10
5858	0	a	It is â¥â¥â¥â¥ you can get banned for nothing Dont waste your time
587	1	a	For no reason 
5690	0	a	It's â¥â¥â¥â¥ don't play it. The matchmaking is broken the graphics have much to be desired. The weapons are unbalanced and the Bronze Silver Gold status is useless. The level up is unclear and pointless since you don't matter only the standing you have with contacts does. The servers are laggy as â¥â¥â¥â¥ and there is absolutely no server moderation leaving hackers open chance to ruin your missions. And other players can ghost your team for the enemy side telling them where you are. Also, random players in the world can smash and destroy objectives and your vehicles and can possibly kill you setting your whole team back. The game is not pay to win nor skill based but just depends on what hacks you bought from  {LINK REMOVED}  systemcheats.net . Don't bother waste your time on it.
4041	0	a	If you like rocketlauncher battle world, you will like it. If you don't, then don't download this game. It's just a pay 2 win with brainless kids.
3949	0	a	As you can see, I've spent TONS of hours on this game. I loved it and I think it's an AWESOME concept for a game, but sadly, as time went by, the game turned more and more into a toxic waste. The community is cancer, the P2W is unbearable, and the devs are the biggest ***holes in the gaming industry. I have to say though, if you have a good group of friends or even if you can find a cool clan to join up with in game, the game is an ABSOLUTE blast. Again, you'd need to be able to stand hackers and p2w features out the Wahoo but it's an enjoyable ride once you get the hang of it and accept the fact you're gonna get pummeled as a noob.
3109	1	a	Basically GTA f2p
8360	0	a	When I download the game it just keeps on updating I wate and wate but nothing happends 
10041	1	a	awsome game i love gomes that your free too explore the world and the quests are nice i dont see anything bad with this game other then the garphics i mean they are good but ive seen better but still an amzing very nice and fun game to play
8008	0	a	I did not recommend this game it's Pay to win
8579	0	a	I have encountered many bosses in my life but you cant beat the boss in this game, the servers.
1708	1	a	its a good game but right now it wont let me play it :/ for some reason
5041	0	a	This game is extremley pay 2 win !
4624	0	a	wtf this dis â¥â¥â¥â¥ bruh bug's and bug's i have BEST Pc and this game laging...... i think...it's need help this game send help
9281	0	a	The game is completely unplayable on a brand new laptop. It freezes, crashes,and if it does run, it does nothing but give the equivlent of what WoW would be on dial up, if that.
95	1	a	Game aint dead, still worth hoping on not pay to win, just whiny noobs claiming it is.
3395	1	a	Its perfect if you like wallet warriors who spend their hard earned money on over priced items!
7663	0	a	This game is simply terrible. The matchmaking sucks (newbies always get paired against veterans), the gear is temporary unless you shell out real money for it, the game won't leave you alone about upgrading to a premium account, and the hit locations are meaningless (you can snipe someone in the foot and it'll technically count as a headshot if they don't have armor). On top of that, botters are rampant throughout the entire game. Most everyone I've played against has at least an aim-bot and/or trigger-bot because they aren't good enough to actually play the game without hacks. The missions are totally bland, too. Every single one basically boils down to whoever can get to the objective location first, and then it's a camp-fest while waiting to murder the entire team challenging the same location.  The bottom line is that APB: Reloaded looked like a good idea on paper, but the execution is horrendous. The anti-cheat system is basically non-existent, as the engine believes botters to be players with pin-point precision (which, in reality, is virtually impossible). With no reliable way to control the cheaters in the community, there's really no point in playing the game at all unless you're with friends. Then you all can have a good laugh at how bad the game is. Skip it.
7238	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this
10857	1	a	Fun and Addictive good job creator
5085	0	a	nothing change
4279	0	a	APB Reloaded is like GTA and Infestation had a baby. Its a robber vs. cops type of game. You team up with people on the same side of yours (cops or robbers) to do missions. The customization on this game is big! You can customize your car, character, and your guns skins. But there is a plus side to this game. It a pay to win game. Most the guns you buy expire in 10 days, when you customize your clothing or car you can't add too many things unless you pay.
630	1	a	Awesome game!!! reminds GTA and it's online
4128	0	a	This game is horrible. Even for a free game. Do not install this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥! First of all,the gameplay is awfull,the guns work like â¥â¥â¥â¥ and make no â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sense,it's better to jump like a rabit around while shooting rather than taking a tactical position and controling u're recoill... The weapons don't make sense either,you start of with a g36,it's free.So that's supposed to be the worst weapon,so i purchased a AK-47 for a bunch of money,guess what...the ak sux for a lot of money --'' Secondly the hackers make me vomite. Then we have just the lame maps and ways to make money...It's all pretty boring i don't see any reason to play this game what so ever. Altough there is something well done in this game. The character creation is one of the best i've ever seen.Professional games these games even lack this,i wish skyrim had this kinda character creation. What they also did great is actually the music,it defently isn't bad at all. I don't recommend this at all,unless your a 7 year old that loves killing the time. Don't let the trailer control you,this game just sucks. 
1303	1	a	APB A mix of GTA and saints row now the question is this game good  Good thing  -Customization is good  -weapons and upgrades are ballanced -classic cop vs robbers thing  -decent characters npc -grapichs are simple and good  Bad thing -you ony keep your new weapon for 7 days -The 'fair' fight system -new players -p2p to get better weapons or upgrade if you wanna rank up -minor bugs  overall 7/10 decent game to play give you the creative freedom to customize your character,car,logo and etc its very hard if your new to the system its a clone of gta and saints row which is fair the creator should really put there best effeorts in this game  BUT NO ONE CARES SO WHY ARE YOU READING THIS?!?!?!  idk thanks for reading and good luck playing p.s 80% of everyone that plays a character custonization is most likely female
46	1	a	It sucks so hard but I keep coming back to it.
3920	0	a	What's the point of having so much customization available in this game if you're just going to get banned when you make a member of the SS with the username AryanMasterRace?
712	1	a	community sucks lol, not worse than LoL [League Of Legends]
7242	0	a	 ~3000hrs spent actively playing outside of steam
1352	1	a	APB:Reloaded is a very nice game cause you cancustomize your car and your character,it has daily objectives and any other stuff you should explore.Let alone its free!!!Give it a try
8914	1	a	Fallen Earth is a very fun and unique game, it has a lot of features such as mining rocks and scavaging in rubbish piles...with the copper you mine from rocks you can craft into bullets. You can also lvl up geometry skill which will allow you to mine higher lvl rocks and get more resorces from them, as far as pvp goes i have yet to try it out. I find that melee is a good skill to start lvling up right away because it can become handy later on, also the quest system is nice filled with different varieties and you never feel as if you have done the same quest more that twice.The map is HUGE and would take hours to explore and going out past a certain point you will find that enemies will get tougher very quickly which will force you to lvl up before exploring more which is good because when you die from a hard enemy and then go lvl up a little bit when you go back to that same enemy you feel like you are getting stronger and making progress towards you'r character. I very much enjoy a few hours a day of fallen earth and would easily give it an 8/10 for mmo standards. I have not seen many fps open world mmorpg's around and this is quite the package if you are looking for a game like this.
2058	1	a	If your waiting for GTA V to come out for the PC like me, this is a fun game to pass time in (assuming you don't want to play GTA IV, of course...)
698	1	a	Good game. Fun. May be innapropriate for younger players ;)
9561	0	a	Absolute trash.
5934	0	a	NO!...just don`t touch the button PLAY GAME!If you do that,hell awaits you!
2811	1	a	Yes, definitely. It's free and it's fun. Cops and robbers, man.
9591	0	a	Step 1.) Create account Step 2.) Log in Step 3.) Ok so it's 'getting an update'? Step 4.) Now I'm re-accepting the agreements... Step 5.) Repeat steps 3-4 until the end of time (or until you stop playing)
3575	1	a	Newbies need to join green districts to learn to play. Do not use the automatic join button on districts. You'll be paired with high level people if you do not follow those instructions.   Recommended if you're interested in thirdperson shooters that involve â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t lag sometimes. Engine update comes out soon. There is hope.   Premium codes are out there. The game is hella fun.
2068	1	a	i like this game nice to play you get lost in it 8 out of 10
5157	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hate this game but the customization too strong girl I cant quit.
10874	1	a	ITS SO FUNNNNNN try it (disney reference XD)
8530	0	a	It's got no controller support, a bunch of high priced DLC, and is just a mess.  I know it's free, but when getting rated, free games don't get a pass just because they can installed, and uninstalled at will. They are games that need to be rated. They don't deserve a free pass.
9944	1	a	For a f2p mmo such as this, the gameplay is quite enjoyable. Though the story takes a small while to warm up, after players get to know the UI to a reasonable level the game becomes slightly addictive. Cooperative class building, equipment crafting and missions make for an enjoyable experience as you and your friends explore new environments.   The only issue I had is late game when pvp gets involved. The terrirotrial resource war pvp becomes very demanding on computer performance. Though not a game breaking issue, folks without gaming towers will just have to stick with pve (which isn't really a bad thing).
1295	1	a	Tons of fun, once you get past the learning curve and actually understand the game its awesome. Recommended to play with friends.
8092	0	a	R-U-B-B-I-S-H!!!! i wont make a long review for a bad game, so heres why..: 1st: UNBALANCED GAME, i always found myself getting crushed by high-rank players 2nd: Unfriendly Community 3rd:This is the worst part.......HACKERS!!! Aimbots everywhere!!  So just dont install this game.....just DONT  
1882	1	a	THIS...IS...AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BEST FPS/ Free to play EVER!!
202	1	a	Everything and more, best thirdperson online game what i am seen!!!!
5006	0	a	Lagging Servers / crashing lobbys / payed weapons are much better then regular ones / ridiculous pricing! (one weapon lifetime 60 bucks lol) alsmost forgot something.. i wrote them ones.. they never replied. â¥â¥â¥â¥ you GamerFist
726	1	a	Good game - Best customization ive seen on any game, can be really good way to pass time and be quite a fun game, other times it can be extremely annoying or laggy as hell. It's very hard for new players to start this game as it is very pay to win, but if you can deal with it, it is an enjoyable game
3146	1	a	can u fix the lag
6643	0	a	Looks so fake i can`t play that...
5226	0	a	STAY AWAY!!!!  This game have a really newb hostile community in its core.... **********************************************************************  I have been playing this for about 4 days now. In those 4 days i experienced,  a lot of hostility towards new players from highlevel players.  I was trying to get my wife into the game too, so i went afk for about 15 secs (in a mission) because she needed my help. when i came back to my screen, i had a really hostile whisper from a team mate, because he had seen me stand still.   I ignored it and resumed our mission, now that same guy started to TK me, and when i asked him why he did that i got 'because you are dumb' Again i I ignored him and tried to resume the mission, but he kept TKing me for the rest of the mission.  Now the mission was over and freindly fire went off, the guy started stalking me and yelling stuff about my mothers â¥â¥â¥â¥ in the global voice chat.  Another episode i had, when i joined a mission was another highlevel player, he started whispering me about my in hes opinion sucky weapon choice. I replied that i just took down 2 of the enemy team with my sucky gun.. but i was assured that it was luck.   After a while the same guy is telling us newbs in the team chat that we should â¥â¥â¥â¥ off the the bronze district and ruin the missions there instead.  Yet another episode was yesterday, when i joined a mission with 3 gold ranked players, all from the same clan (WASP) one of them ran me over with hes car, i asked him why he did that, he replied 'â¥â¥â¥â¥ you, you dont look where you walk' so when tried to return to the mission objective they all 3 started TKing me, and i was told that they liked to shoot low lvl players, so they ended up hunting me around the map untill the mission was ended.
5457	0	a	gta multiplayers worst copy :(
4354	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ game, enough said
1527	1	a	The clothing content of this game is doable, the cars are pretty cool especially the Jericho my favorite just putting it out there, and the guns here range from simple to skilled depending on your preferance. There are plenty of sales that goes on throughout the year so u have plenty of chances to buy your necessary guns and equipment to take down your opponent. Play more in groups more than solo gameplay to get a more greater experience playing this game. This game is not the best stress reliever. TAKE TIME OFF from playing this game as well for YOU WILL get mad on several occasions playing APB. THIS GAME IS FULL OF BLATANT HACKERS and bad mouth people. Not recommend to play for any age. Find another game to play
998	1	a	Take me down, to the San Paro city, where the noobz are green and teh hacks are pretty.
203	1	a	one of the worst games I've ever played. there is nothing to do. you can't do anything in it. there's tdm and missions and you can wear clothes but if you are a girl you cannot wear certain pants.
10273	1	a	Pretty fun, and different. Cheaply made models for some things, and some odd bugs, controls are confusing but it's.. alright?  7/10
8550	0	a	This game needs a lot of improvements, it's laggy, combat is old, and it's dead, no players play anymore :D But this game is cool and can be improved, and full customization bring BIG UP :D but i can't recommend it until it will be improved, i'll change my review if it will be updated.
6236	0	a	Wont even let me play,everytime I click 'play' it says APB:Reloaded (Not Responding)
2071	1	a	good but rage inducing game
8145	0	a	This game requires that you downgrade your graphics drivers pretty heavily for the game to even launch at all. Sorry APB, but I'm not going back to 2011's geForce drivers just for you.
5241	0	a	&gt; Join a Server &gt; Run around for 5 minutes &gt; Press K (Ready for mission) &gt; Everything goes smooth until final objective &gt; Team mate tries to tk me &gt; Kills Team mate &gt; Team mate rages &gt; Mission complete &gt; Join another mission &gt; Team mate tries to tk me &gt; Kills team mate &gt; 3 other people help tk'er &gt; I get kicked for excessive Tk'ing  10/10 would do again.
1173	1	a	Its a game

7449	0	a	Game controls are Saints Row II awkward, and community is full of bitter people. Not trolls trying to be funny, just bitter people.
4169	0	a	If I was stuck in a room with only a computer,a copy of APB, and a fully loaded revolver--I'd shoot myself 6 times before I play this steaming â¥â¥â¥â¥.
10374	1	a	Fallen Earth is an entertaining MMORPG set in the apocolyptic future. You play as one of countless clones with an unknown past and future, searching for more than an identity. With countless factions to join, aid, and/or harm, you the player are able to advance and change the storyline of the world. With countless means of combat from guns, explosives, mutations, psionics, and even swords and axes, you can find all a manner of ways to customize your battle experience. With a crafting system that will let you make almost everything in the game as well you can be certain you will almost always be able to make and use anything you find and/or see. The use of third person view for exploration and interaction and first person view for combat may be of some concern for some players, along with the need to explore select areas in groups, but otherwise, the game is easy to get used to and play on your own.
6993	0	a	This game is absolute disaster, it had multiple years to fix it. But it did squat but make p2w weaponry. This game is not worth it, PRERIOD.
10877	1	a	Don't lie, This takes you back. A free to play 8 bit rpg multiplayer shooter with multiple preset classes that you can use to murder random spawning gods and stay alive. The mad god will challenge you until you and your elite gear are wiped of existance and you start again, yep... Perma death. You fantasy fans and old people and kids finding a good shooter that is apropriate enough to keep them entertain and exhilarated for hours on end. Realm of the Mad God is a great game.
7063	0	a	This game drove me mad as i spent ages downloading it and then i could play it for about six hours and then when i tried to play the following day it just wont start. any tips to help
1135	1	a	I think its a little bit like arma 3 altis life... Just my thaughts of the game...
9066	0	a	it isnt really free. when i downloaded it it just made me make an account for some other game engine. it also dowloads other things that arent even associated to it. do not get this game!
6635	0	a	If you see an hour played, thats the time ive tried starting the game and cant even play it -.-

932	1	a	It's like eating â¥â¥â¥â¥ and drinking diarrhea at the same â¥â¥â¥â¥ing time. Basically it's just bad
3235	1	a	When I first downloaded this game I jumped straight into it and have played it for 62 hours in total, it has its ups and downs. But also holds a great downside which is where newbies are being put up against veterans/experienced players. This could be fixed by adding 3 servers, one for low levelled players, one for higher levelled players and another one for mixed players where low levelled players can still go up against higher levelled players, this would be good because you could have a friend who is a much higher level than you when you're only level 1, you can just jump straight into the mixed server and join him/her
7579	0	a	This game has a great concept but poor impimentation. The driving is buggy, the servers constantly lag, and there isn't much of a tutorial. Missions are fun, but there's no real progression that reels you in. The only progression you have is upgrading your gear so you can earn more money so you can upgrade your gear (sounds quite Runescape-esque to me). In any case, this game can be fun with a few friends and in limited doses. 6/10.
8411	0	a	I regret what i've said after a year of playing this game. It used to be good, now it's full of hackers and cheaters. Not a great game to play anymore.....
6183	0	a	Once upon a time there were 2 boys named timmy and johnny. Timmy had found a awsome game he thought so he introduced that game to Johnny. Johnny was a bit skeptical at first but then he started to enjoy this game aswell. He had enjoyed the game so much he even put some money into the game. He thought wow this games character customization is so great but then he soon came to realize his stupid â¥â¥â¥â¥ing friend had made him oblivious to the fact that the game was such utter pay to win â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t that he decided to uninstall and go back to CS:GO where the hackers were a dime a dozen but there was no pay to win â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t like APB had. People i am little Johnny, Dont make the same mistake i did. Dont waste your time or money thinking hey its gonna get better or hey this will be fun because not only is it pay to win there are lots of cheaters. Enjoy :)
9752	0	a	Created an account, and it wont even let me log in. I tried my Steam username/password and the seperate account I had to create and both didn't work. Complete waste of time.

6619	0	a	Freaking stupid makes my profile say im in the game but im not thisgame sucks
1869	1	a	Clocking in 1k hours in this game really makes me see how much i love it. It's been a while now since i played because once you reach the top levels the progress is a bit slow and the updates takes a long time to come out.  The new anti-cheat system really have cleaned up the game and the name-shaming in the chat is not nearly as bad as before which makes the game more fun and nice to spend time in.  Make sure you get some friends in Skype/Teamspeak or similar and play together, that is how the game should be played.  I am definatly returning to the game when the Unreal Engine 3.5 update rolls out!
9916	0	a	Had high hopes for this game when I saw it, but some of the little things in the game put me right off within minutes such as, you cannot move your head whilst jumping, the stupid look when you have your fist inside your own gun among other issues. I have only just played the tutorial and I imagine I will have another play of this game and see what I think after another hour or so, but till then, the little things irk me too much. Obviously I am not patient enough to deal with these things, and while I do not reccommend it I believe that others would find it alot more enjoyable than I. I will play again and re-review if I find it more fun next time!
10889	1	a	This game is really fun to use and play.  Small size for an amazing game aswell as it's easy to pickup and play!
3122	1	a	Good game but full of cheeters... :(  is good to play...
2971	1	a	loce this game
2534	1	a	Wanna be a Criminal? Sure why not? Wanna be an Enforcer? Sure why not!?!?!? Shoot bad guys do missions rob people steal cars.... basically this is a GTA MMO. GET THIS NOW!
2203	1	a	DO IT!
5214	0	a	YEAH, NO â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS GAME...i didnt even get a chance to play it, it instantly crashes, and now theres a godamn pop up from the devs stuck on my screen after i unistalled it. â¥â¥â¥â¥ YOU. â¥â¥â¥â¥ YOU â¥â¥â¥â¥ YOU
9218	1	a	After wandering the wasteland of Fallen Earth for more than 200 hours, thought it was time to give my opinon. There is a staggering amount of quests, mutant creatures, and crafting. Being this is such an awsome free mmo, I would rate this a 9/10. This game has been around for years now, and still has alot of people coming back for more. The graphic are smooth and realistic. A variety of sound, grapic, and other setting options. The help chat is one of the best I have ever seen! Hard not to get a help queston answered by more than one player. The ability to ride horses, atv's, and sweet cars across a very large map makes me want to get 3D headset. If there were air and water craft, I would probably never want to stop gaming!?.
5750	0	a	Great game. Corrupt company. Don't play it.
8520	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ ass game don't work.
2744	1	a	I writing a game review cause I have to. Game is good if you play it a lot. its hard to get enough coin to get any good gear
4838	0	a	What I like about this game:  - Awesome Character Customization - Good Car Mechanics - Great Art style - Amazing Party System - Music is awesome to (I like how you can import your own music) - Okay Graphics (Not complaing)  What I hate about this game:  - Match making sucks BOOTY - Laggy servers, and website - Sometimes I'd be the one shooting at someone first and they just be like *Cracks neck* BANG BANG, Two shot me. -_- - It seems like the Devs don't care about user imput :I - Hackers - SUPER UNBALANCE (Although I think I just said that) - Takes forever for new players to get to max rank on a pledge because, they loose every single round. - Join last 17 seconds of mission and then loose (come on, are you kidding me?) - Trial on weapons. It feels like they are depriving users of ownership of a weapon because they don't have real money to buy the actual thing to keep it. I don't like that crap, and it needs to go. - Enforcers seems to be a little OP, especially with their pepper inlaced bullets. - No cap on what rank goes to what server. Like seirously, GOLD should only go to GOLD servers, and SILVER should only go to SILVER servers, and BRONZE should only got to BRONZE servers. I freaking at it when Gold be sniffin' up on the Bronze Servers. It's kinda â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ move on the Gold people's part.... - Other players can't listen to imported music. There is no point of importing music if others can't hear it as well....
8593	0	a	Game is heinous. Aimbots galore with lag and broken matchmaking system makes this game a wannabe gta multiplayer that couldn't be.
1064	1	a	A free gta basically
933	1	a	GTA Online, basically.  Get this game. Mostly due to the fact that it's free to play, but also because its a solid game. It has a lot in common with the extremely popular GTA franchise, with its massive open-world, car stealing, citizen killing and varied weapon selection, but it obviously lacks a coherent story, since it's mostly a Massively Multiplayer Online game, so if you're looking for story, don't try this game. If you're looking for quick fun, action packed gameplay, try it out.   The customization is INSANE in this, you'll probably spend a few hours just to create your character. And the customization doesnt stop here: weapons, clothing (you can customize the clothings, not just what your character is weraing, meaning you can not only change colors but apply designs, logos, emblems, etc on them) and the many vehicles are 100% customizable (and usually upgradable aswell)  Thanks to its random missions and its nice PVP mode, the replayability is extremely high in this game. Just jump in and play.  Graphics 10/10 Soundtrack 9/10 Replayability 14/15 Gameplay 12/15  Overall - 9/10
4682	0	a	Hate it, to many OP players, not suitable for beginners
1968	1	a	Honestly gta 1 was better than this.
7783	0	a	Going to be honest game used to be good like 2 years ago now its pretty terrible G1 support is also terrible with helping most players and they ban legit players who are better then above average. Played this game since CBT and I personally have felt the ban hammer for 'Suspected use of third party software to give an advantage over other players.' (Note: I have never hacked in this game nor done anything that is borderline considering how much time and money I have spent on it I think it would be stupid to but I am Unbanned now) but to even think they are banning legit players is disgusting. Games not terrible its more the owners of the game and their staff although they take like 2 weeks to release a patch that is literally 'Fixed a bug where you could drop the objective and it will float 5m in the air.' and that is all. Most guns in the game are either OP and kill you instantly or suck and you can use an entire magazine and still not kill someone. Finally the game will have terrible FPS if you dont have a good computer. Bottom line is im not telling you to not give it a try but IMO If I had the choice of starting again in the games current state I would stay clear of it.
9437	1	a	Cool but i do belive that nonmebers should get some form of a dune buggy at very low level just because its fair :3
7891	0	a	To be honest, if you wanna enjoy this game be prepared to spend at least 300 dollars more on it. The average is 1500 dollars.  Enjoy your pay to win free to play game.
9147	1	a	This game is cool for time consuming but it does have some realy bad bugs like on the first mission i finshied the mission and i couldnt take another one.
4632	0	a	Wow, ok. So apparently they made this free to play. So, long ago I had actually BOUGHT this game and up until about 2014 I had it in my steam library, because it was a purchase. Well, I go to play some today (2016) and find that it was removed from my account, either because they 're-released' it, or because they voided my purchase. Anyway, I go to download it and notice that it isn't 'free to play' but actually 'free to pay' NINETY-NINE F'ING DOLLARS FOR DLC?! THIRTY DOLLARS? The developers also don't know how to do DLC because they have the same DLC pack for both $29 and...free....So, let me see, you delete the game (which I paid for), didn't issue me a refund, and now expect people to pay $139 for your DLC which adds basic game functionality to it? Oh, yeah, they also have a habit of deleting your accounts due to 'database malfunctions'. (see 2011) HA! No way I would recomend this. This was a dead game back in 2011 and now, under the tyranical control of the new 'developers' (must be french for check cashers), has become not only a joke but a steaming pile of feces.

9317	0	a	Great game but unless you pay to play your character runs into xp level issues getting new quests in the 3rd region.  Also the melee based character is completely disadvantaged in many areas as the threat range for other NPC is within melee range, and they all have guns. So mnay quests can not be done ntil much higher levels (reduce threat ranges), thus less rewards (which are already reduced due to not playing to play).  The lack of players means it is hard to find teams to do some quests.
3201	1	a	this game is hilarious you can do any thing you want to... also you can choose what thing you want to be... by that I mean that you can either be a criminal or you can be a cop it is clearly your choice... aswell as doing this you can customise your character an way you want to... this game I recommend it is brilliant... well that is what I think at least

5369	0	a	JUST READ IT BEFORE YOU PLAY. THIS WILL SAVE YOU FROM A MENTAL BREAKDOWN  F UCK.THIS.S HIT. DONT PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU VALVUE YOUR SANITY.At first this game was awesome alright, having fun doing good stacking up the g's. Now my first thing i want to say is that there is A F UCKING R ETARDED GLITCH where when you buy a gun it will charge you for it 2-4 times losing the money you just spend 6 hourss working for. Next complain. ALOT OF THE PEOPLE, mostly the criminals, WHO PLAY THIS GAME ARE F UCKING D IPSHIT A SSHOLES WHO FEEL THE NEED TO OVERCOMPENSATE FOR THER F UCKING MICRO P ENIS'. When your trying to earn chash,the point of the game, you'll have people who decive you, say they will help you and right before you are about to get money they will f ucking r ape you and give you their F UCKING AIDS so that you die and they can steal your money. Next, when your in a van your IMMEDEA TELY F UCKED; having a van basically says 'hey im transporting a s hit load of money come and f ucking get it you c unts'. Now that will trigger all the squeakers around you and they will immedeatly flock to your a sshole trying to wait for you to get out of your van to steal your it, the f ucked up thing is that you need to leave the van to stat making the money, not going to explain ho because it will take too long. Just image the scene from finding nemo with the seagulls, great now replace them with R ETARDED 7 YEAR OLDS. Ok, my final point is that one of the easiest ways to make money is ram raiding which is what i have been talking about mostly, when you have been sweating your a sshole off for the past century to the point where it's dicintegrating your gonna have a nice fat stack of chash available in the back of your van. When/If you get to turn this in with out the f uckboy's around stalking you. Your gonna be on the map if you have above 2.5k dollars. When you've been working THAT F UCKING LONG AND THAT F UCKING HARD AND YOU GET IMMEDEATLY F UCKED IN THE A SS AND YOUR MONEYS BEEN STOLEN YOUR SOUL GETS SUCKED OUT OF YOUR A SS AND YOU WASTE 30 MINUTES OF YOUR LIFE JUST LIKE ME WRITING A RAGE REVIEW ON STEAM BECAUSE ANGER IF THE ONLY THING THAT KEEPS YOU ALIVE. And so concludes my review/essay on why never the play this CANCER GAME.
4498	0	a	Can't even verify my email from my mail account to log into my gamersfirst account which i need to connect to my steam account for some reason.   Too many accounts - 0,0/10 IGN
4102	0	a	Worst game in existance. Freezes and Crashes constantly, Hackers everywhere, Laggy, Glitchy, and a complete Clone of GTA  EDIT: It's also pay to win, the devs are money vampires, they suck the money oudda ya' wallet!  I would give this a 3/10 at least the graphics are nice, but that doesn't matter because it won't even let me frickin (YOU FREAKING FRICKS WHEN WILL YOU LEARN) move and then freeze and crash..
10393	1	a	This game is amazing, lots of crafting, lots of pvp, tons of customization. To me it's one of the exceptions that is not a pay-to-win game
10521	0	a	  Edit 25/06/2016: KABAM sold this game to a small indie company - They might bring new life into the game agian / If so ignore this review :)   Realm of the Mad God is a massively co-op action RPG created with an overused generic pixel art.   The game was decent at first, and i have put alot of hours and money into this game, but... It's all pay to win now.   It really seems fun when you start, but then you realize that the only reliable way to get good items is to pay Kabam or use 100 hours on a charecter trying to make it 6/8 and endning up dying because of server lag. You will last a few lives until you ragequit because of the completely unique yet really annoying perma-death mechanic, which only enforces the motivation to pay. Ofcause you can manage to play the game without paying anything and have fun, but it will seriously take you 300years to manage to get as far as someone who just put in 50$ on the game.   Don't waste your time or $ on this game, its a dying game and havnt been updated for a long time and probably wont get any updates in the near future.
8483	0	a	terrible game not worth even for free
8111	0	a	The game is OKAY at best. The maps are OKAY in size. The combat is OKAY. The driving is not good. The game is confusing and the overall game feels clunky and un-finished. If you're too cheap for GTA (like myself) and end up downloading this game with high hopes, your best bet is not to waste your time on this one. 
3703	1	a	Its a great game to play similar to Grand Theft Auto
2756	1	a	Great game. Loads of fun. It's like GTA but online. The amount of customization beats any game I've ever seen. Sadly, gameplay 100% competetive and ate up with cheaters. Aside from that, you will have tons of fun just hanging out with friends and designing your character, cars, clothes, tattoos, graffiti, and even music.
2159	1	a	This game is great for a F2P. It feels like GTA sanandreas except a cops and robbers version of that game.  Pros The game would easily cost money and be well worth it but its F2P  Progressive gameplay gives you a goal to keep playing   you never fill pressured to spend actual money on the game as you can just use in game currency to purchase every   thing you need and want with in game currency. Cons  Ive had some bad experience with the comunity so I just mute everybody. it saves me from having to listen to the pure duchbaggery that people on this game can be It's not just me its quite a large group of people having a disconecting problem it happens randomly you could be afk or in a mission or looking for a mission the game will dc you and you will have to sit throught the long as â¥â¥â¥â¥ loading screens.  My final thoughts on the game is that its a clunky F2P open world 3rd person shooter with a good idea but poor exacution. The comunity is bad and allot of them are whinny and imature but this is just my experience. the game is addicting and can be fun its worth about 20 dollars well worth a try    also people say gta clone I say true crime and saints row jumped off a building and this is the spatter they scrapped off the pavement.
8749	0	a	Very unfriendly to new players. Also lot of weaboos.
354	1	a	I have played APB:Reloaded for 4 years total with 2920 hours in game (i dont use steam a whole ton hence ~1k hours.) Great game, great customization. Completely free to play, there is 0 PTW at all. Premium only gives benefits to customization, and aftermatch bonuses. Everything on ARMAS is reskins, early progression, weapon skins, and clothing and vehicle kits. Weapons are well balanced within their niches. Its a little difficult to get a handle on when starting, but find some friends, join a clan, and it becomes a lot better! It has significantly gotten better with the implementation of FairFight (Don't believe most of the claims in chat that someone is 'cheating', most times they actually aren't), and seems that it will only get better.  I recommend this game to players who wish to challenge themselves, can easily learn from their mistakes, and learn from their enemies. As well as players who enjoy customizing their characters, as it has some of the best customization options I have seen in a game so far.  Game also uses a bit of Ram 8gb will do just fine, anything less will probably get frustrating.  See you in San Paro!
4095	0	a	A great potential â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up by its devs. What a waste of a good game...  EDIT: came back after 4 years to see what happened to this game.  Less players, more hackers, more pay2win G1 slaves, the same exploits and bugs from 2012, a few new guns and cars but not new gamemodes or important updates, ... My suggestion: Don't even try this game, it was a bit playable back in 2012 but now it's just impossible.
3147	1	a	APB Reloaded has been retuned since it's initial relaunch and the game has a lot to offer. Not a perfect title, but worlds better than it used to be and very fun with tons of customization. No PvE, the game is entirely PvP so be prepared.
425	1	a	awsome 
2852	1	a	This game is BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORING BUT STILL FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUN!
3993	0	a	Game was going fine for a moment, until PunkBuster decides to kick me out of the district for no reason.   Uninstalling this piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥. I knew that this game is not good yet.  0/10 because PunkBuster is a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
8206	0	a	I try to play and just didn't work at all and i have a good computer for games.
10525	0	a	It used to be a fun/addicting game, but it Kabaam (the company that bought out the game) is all about stuffing money into their â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ fat bloody pockets. It was so much more fun with non soulbounded items, no insanely high tier items in the store, and no stupid pets.    ----EDIT---- Updated Review as of 5/9/16 12:53 AM  So I decided to go ahead and play the game once again since I flew back home for my 1.5 weeklong summer vacation after college.   TL;DR:  The game is fun, but holy sh*t, the gold spammers got worse and there are minimal amounts of effort to update the game. So yeah, it's fun, go ahead and play it for a bit if your internet doesnt' suck. However, I still can't recommend this game because Kabaam continues to demonstrate a classic example of a company that buys out another company, providing a minimal amount of effort to make any improvements to the game (because, 'why make improvements when you can do nothing at all and still make money off of the 12 year olds that fall for this pay2win scheme?').  ------------------------------------------------------------------  The game has gone through a laughably minimal amount of updates since I had last played this game, over a year ago. For a 2D MMO with a lot of potential for interesting, frequent updates, I thought that perhaps some unique new gamemodes, some cool improvements to the hub world, and new classes would be released.    Did I see  any  of those changes in the game:   no, not really     What I discovered in my +25 hours of playing (while on vacation): 
4991	0	a	So I was eating this Chipotle burrito, and some of the meat fell out the back.  I really wanted to eat the meat with the tortilla, but I didnât want to get my hands all messy and I didnât have any utensils next to me, but I did have one certain disc next to me.  Thatâs about how much value this game is worth, the price of a plastic spoon.

9765	0	a	i thought this game might be good. Played it for 10 minutes and wanted to kill myself.
7611	0	a	I will say this, I wanted to go back to this game after playing it during my highschool days and dropping it after say a few months.  The game is amazing on customization as in beautifully stunning in the fact that EVERYTHING can be changed with your character (Clothing to body) and Cars and guns (albeit with premium limitations on designing) but beyond sitting in the hub far from the sh!tstorm that is the open world of APB:R, there isn't much more to be said about it, if anything I would rather pick up the game just to twiddle with the fun customization stuff you can do than hoping and praying that I can have a fun firefight with all kinds of players that isn't laggy or one sided on who has a sniper/rocket launcher or an ARMAS bought gun.
8064	0	a	Pay2Win crap
8775	0	a	Okay I heard this a pretty good game but I cant play it because i figured i needed to download a â¥â¥â¥â¥ ton of stuff fit=rst then it cant play on windows 10 if they can fix I'll recommend it but for now no stars
4724	0	a	i dont have it but it sucks 
7096	0	a	I haven't played for very long, but that doesn't mean I can't say that I don't like it. It tries to be like GTA but ends up being a freemium-esque game. Horrible quality. Zero stars.
9273	0	a	Game was poop when I actually bought it in 2011. Very confuseing, no help from anyone, bugged quests, unclear ability uses and stat description....... an all around fail. The only cool thing about it was the vehicles and haveing to buy gas and what not, because the version I got gave me a quad.
7219	0	a	Pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ tbh, anyone thinking to get into this game should just buy The Division.  Everything APB does, The Division does better imo.
3206	1	a	There has to be 10,000+ more things to do. I started a long time ago and still havent finished, Customize Vehicles and yourself, You can pick 1 side, theres 2, Thug or Police Choose your fate, grab your gun.
9553	0	a	If you like to RP then this game is for your for everything else go find a different game. The Devs have no idea how to develop a video game and most of them ended up quiting anyways there is like 3 developers left.
6765	0	a	IF you paid or invested a ton of time into it, you can play it. If not be prepaired to face horrible ballance issues and get bullied around CONSTANTLY. Did i mention next to no player physics, no tutorial, no clue of WTF is going on. Maybe im just tired, but it has some serious frustrating issues from the start that make for a agrivating experiance.
6578	0	a	This game is unfinished and buggy. Only creating my character took me about hour and I had to do it 3 times. And then, after I joined server, game started to crash every time I tried to choose spawnpoint. I have to wait to next update and hope they will do something. They did. I finally succeed to start game without crashes, but there were so huge lags that I refused to continue playing. Oh my God! This can be so much good game! Character customizations, symbol and vehicle editors. I don't know much games able to rival! Just, please, DO SOMETHING WITH ALL THOSE BUGS!
7511	0	a	This game is probably the best example of Pay 2 Win abominations. While the concept of the game is nice and the gameplay is pretty easy to get used to, it suffers from numerous very serious problems.  Graphics of the game is slightly above average. It doesn't really look bad, but you'll quickly notice that the optimization is rather flawed and the game is unstable and choppy.  When it comes to music, there are several radio stations to listen to, so you could say there's a bit for everyone. Even classical music, which was my personal favorite.  The gameplay itself is okay, but servers often crash and you'll have a hard time finding one that doesn't lag like hell. As I mentioned before, this is pretty much purely a Pay 2 Win game. While you earn some in-game cash to buy yourself new clothes, new cars and other stuff for your 'image', weapons can only be bought for about a week and then they disappear again. So you must either play 24/7 in order to earn enough, or just pay real money for that â¥â¥â¥â¥. And let me tell you - most of those pathetic kids do it. Stuff that you buy with real money is ridiculously overpowered, so you'll just end up angry playing against such no-lifers. The game is also swarmed by cheaters and nobody usually gives a damn about it, so they just keep cheating.  There is no story. You can either play as a cop or as a criminal. You fight each other in a number of game modes. All of them include shooting each other and some include car chases. You get thrown to the game without any tutorial, so you don't know what to do and you must learn the hard way. The community mostly isn't friendly, let alone willing to help you.  The best thing about this game is the customization. There's a wide range of clothes, colors and accessories. You can also create your own decals for both your car and your character. It's also important to mention that you get to create your character before you begin. You can change your face, but also your body. And options here have almost no limits.  What can I say? Despite its great customization options, good concept and fine gameplay, I can't recommend this game. All the fun you can have is quickly ruined by P2W people, cheaters, bad optimization, unstable servers and a very unfriendly community.

131	1	a	With so many hours in the game, I decided that today I will give my conclusion about the game. As you might know, All Points Bulletin: Reloaded is an open-world MMO third person shooter in which two sides, the Enforcers and the Criminals are fighting for control over the city. In my entire gaming career, I haven't seen a game that offers this much customization. From creating symbols like camos, tattoos and logos, to fighting in districts such as Financial(a close quarters combat zone city) and Waterfront(a district mostly for snipers and such), APB Reloaded offers a great experience. Although, bare with me, there are some downsights such as: -Progression will take a long time. It's more like griding if you're the type of guy who cares for the level and the reward. In this case, if you want to spend some money, I recommend Premium. With Premium, you have around 90% more xp and money. -Another thing about Premium is that it allows you to add symbols to your body or clothes up to 50. With f2p, you can add only 3 symbols. -Matchmaking. Oh my god, the matchmaking...  Get ready to fight against maximum threat level enemies. This is still a major problem of the game, since launch. -Some weapons might be overpowered, but there are also weapons for f2p players that are op as well.   Overall, if you are willing to spend some money in the game, I definately recommend it. Playing with friends will bring a much better experince, as any multiplayer/co-op game.

2928	1	a	I played APB in the First State of game and after the Gamecompany has changed... 99% of the gamer Hack like hell and yes its an nice game if your good in designing Clothes and Cars but so its more like an 'ok' game.
9948	1	a	FANTASTIC game!! GREAT graphics and gameplay!!! Whether you want to craft, farm and harvest, or blast your way through endless mutants, THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!! Vehicles, weapons and armor, camps and farms...you name it, you can craft it!! The storyline is good, and just the gameplay itself is worth it!!! I would recommend this game to anyone...you wont be disappointed!!!!

3250	1	a	I just mess up all the other people's stuff, like 1. he parked down his car next to the mission building 2. I crash into his car 3. everybody yays   oh me :(
4849	0	a	it is an alright sandbox game with what you would expect but it suffers from many of the usual free to play problems evrything is way to grindy some guns are just straight up better than others and in general the gunplay isnt fun i wouldnt reccomend this game unless you had some friends to play with for a little bit 
1345	1	a	The game is super annoying to begin with, Match making is beyond bad. However the customization and free roam maps are great. They helped me continue to the point where I had good items to play with the better players without constant rage.
4823	0	a	TOO PAY TO WIN TO PLAY. THIS GAME SUCKS
1554	1	a	This Game is fun!!! :D
3414	1	a	Its pretty good once you know how to get costum stuff very unique engines of creating stuff, You get very confused for a bit at the start but it gets really good! kinda reminds me about GTA

10633	1	a	I guess this game is ok. :D
5822	0	a	Let me first say that I have several hundred hours from the sandalone version, so I've played more than the 7.9 on my account. The game is fun, it's sort of like a knockoff GTA. You can be a bad guy, rob shops and get into turf wars, do fun violent things, etc. The games biggest benefit, though, is the fact that you can also be a cop. Any cop players who see the criminal players doing bad stuff or doing missions can immediately intervene and **** them up, which makes for some good fun, and fighting real players as cops is a lot more fun than the crappy AI in games like GTA.  However, this game suffers immensely from it's pay-to-win tactics, through which you will dominate all other players if you have $20 to blow. The devs tout your ability to customize your character, despite the fact that if you want to place more than a few decals on your car or make an intricate design on your clothes you again have to pay money. Want one of the good guns? Give us money. Want to use said guns for more than a few days? MORE money. Want to get a decent car? ALL THE MONEY. You want to KEEP that car? Oh baby you know that's only allowed if you want to spend money. 'Wow our game is so cool and free-to-play.'  Honestly if they scrapped all the pay-to-win stuff and just charged $10-$20 for the game, this would be a fantastic game. The core features and physics are strong, the gameplay is fun when you're not being bulldozed by people with expendable income, and the game has tons of variety. But all of these strengths are shadowed by the money-grubbing nature of this game. Until they update to a new engine as they've been promising for a long time, and at least cut back on the pay-to-win features, this game is NOT worth playing.   In my opinion, the devs should just design the game again from the ground up with a new engine and release it as a seperate game at a reasonable price. There's no excuse to not do that.
8301	0	a	I cant start up APB Reloaded I have installed everything. When my PC asks for permission to run the app I press yes and then nothing else happens.HELP!?
2202	1	a	BEST GAME EVER 10/10  too bad its so hard to run though but on my pc i can run it 65FPS max settings but my friend can only run at min settings 25FPS with frame drops
9399	1	a	it is amazing never played it  
2329	1	a	it like GTA only some players can be cops the other criminals you can steal cars find and use weapons it awesome
8315	0	a	3rd party â¥â¥â¥â¥.
8181	0	a	Incredibly pay to win, skill has little to do with how much you win. Easily the worst community I've ever seen on any game.
3006	1	a	You dont have p2w u just need some skills, but take time, now with the new patch the ahckers star to be bann and that is a progress because is more fair, this is a great game to paly with friends or to make new ones because many people are social, but a few are #####, in my opinion i love this game, but you need to try it before belive me
4296	0	a	It doesn't work after I press 'Start' on the launcher,
4957	0	a	2015, already ruined.
6482	0	a	I'd skip this one. Its buggy and unbalanced. Great Idea, though, and the character customization is very, very good.
153	1	a	Wow. This game is awesome. If you aren't aloud to play GTA, go to this.
7029	0	a	SOOOOO much wasted potential. This game could have been what GTA online should have been, but too many flaws are holding it back.  The gameplay is very, very fun. Missions have you either breaking into buildings, hijacking cars, or hacking satellites if you are a criminal, or preventing criminals from doing so and arresting people if you are a dirty copper. While most of the time the missions are actually balanced and require strategic plays and superior aiming from both teams, there are plenty of times where mission objectives can be exploited by parking a car on top of the objective and shooting it til it explodes, rendering the mission impossible to complete. Not fair or fun. It is also very likely as a bronze rank you will get stuck against gold ranks with pay2win 1shotkill guns.  Also hackers. So. Many. Hackers. If you somehow manage to make it to gold rank, you will never be in another mission without an aimbotter. You won't. Ever.  Customization is amazing. Everything is customizeable from your character to the car they drive to the song the enemy hears when they kill you. But hackers. Always hackers everywhere aimbots hacks hacking hackers hacked bot botter aimot botting aimbotting hacks
3982	0	a	I thought it wasn't any good out of ten i would give it a 1 because you have to make a account first. Plus it is saints row but rubbish so my opinion is just get GTA or Saints row, they are better because APB is cheap you can't do half the things you can in GTA.PLease don't get it. this is my experience and you would know what I mean.
2318	1	a	Awsome game!!!!!!!!!!
4051	0	a	This game was good when it was a subscription based game when it went free to play it turned into a Pay2Win crap.

1065	1	a	this game sux. Go play tf2
10605	1	a	I started playing this game in 2010 (not on Steam, I guess I have less than 300 hours played). It has changed a lot since that time - sound effects have changed, content was added, already existing items and enemies were balanced and, last but not least, the game was sold to another studio. Twice.   The time when RotMG belonged to first one, Wildshadow Studios, was probably the best time of the game. Game was simple and fun to play, Pay to Win almost didn't exist. In 2012 RotMG was sold to Kabam. They made it a bit Pay to Win, they also did nothing aganist hackers. Later, they decided to work on their other games instead of RotMG, but in July 2016 Deca Games bought RotMG - they keep adding new content and events and they finnaly started fighting aganist notifier hackers. Now it's really a good time for the game.  RotMG is a bullet-hell, team MMORPG with A LOT of different items, monsters and dungeons. All 14 classes are available for free (you only need a bit of time to get 'em all) and are almost perfectly balanced. You can play support/dps/tank (often mixed in one character), whatever you want. There's also a possibility of joining a guild consisting of other players. Overall, the game is indrecibly fun to play despite being a bit Pay to Win - there's a perma-death, character loses all of his items upon dying. MMO Dark Souls for free.  You can have a lot of fun playing RotMG, especially with a group friends, or a guild and you don't have to spend a lot of time on it.  8/10 would lose everything again
7426	0	a	this game. issue after issue. so, first off. after opening it the 2nd time. the launcher was scanning. infinitely. for god knows what. after disabling IPv6 protocol, it worked. but when i tried to launch game. it did absolutely nothing. well, it opened chrome tab, 'like us on facebook to get 1 day free premium' (big whoop one god damn day..) after pressing launch AGAIN. it opened a splash screen. then opened another one. after leaving it like this for couple mins. nothing. so far, from my experience. this game. not worth 1 hr of downloading. (5GB from steam, then came with 500MB update from launcher, which only downloaded at 25-50% of my max download limit..)  (as i havent been able to play this game yet. dont take in consideration of my 'do you recomend this game' as u may not experience this issues like i have.)
2635	1	a	Deffinately recommended since it became free to play. Its fun and entertaining. If you dont pick it up full time it will atleast make you giggle for a weekend if not a week.
9236	1	a	When it was pay to play i made free accounts (a lot of them), and i enjoyed it but in the end i did pay for the subscriptions. played it like crazy for the first 4-5 months but then got borde of it. but i do go back to it every now and then for a bit. good character builds to mess around with, nice landscaping and graphics but the character animations are not 100%

9536	0	a	I mean, if you want to spend $100+ on a game instead of something useful in life; then SURE go ahead and play this game. I mean, who doesn't like shoddy grsphics, a horrible community, and horrible controls...then yes if you want to pay $100+ just to SURVIVE for a little while in this game...go right ahead...
1066	1	a	I love this game but i wish it wasnt so hard on my pc 
484	1	a	What can be said about APB reloaded? A lot. I came from the orginal All points, which was a super fun game. This game sort of lives up to the orginal. Its fun, people are (sometimes) nice. Very well balanced at low levels. Customization  Pros: Customization (character/Cars) Weapons (tons) Driving Custom Decals Level system Rank system Group party Extra events Ram Raids (crimes) Faction choice  Cons: PTW golds Costly Perm weapons with extra damage Unbalanced game servers Reward to spend ratio low  Overall PTW -2 Fun +2 Customization +2 Weapons +2 Multiplayer +2 Money Ratios -2 funky gameplay -2  Overall 6/10. Not bad, not much of a free to play game.
10587	1	a	If maplestory was a browser game.....
6215	0	a	do not buy this game it does not work
6733	0	a	I did not enjoy my time with APB Reloaded  It was a great consept for a game but it had not only been done before but better  Pros: -Charater custamizion is very good and lots of diffrent thing to choose  -Meuns are nice -the ablity to create your own custom decals and put them on cars and your chartars cloths is nice  Cons:  -The city feels empty with little to no people walking around -The city is grey and not colour full  -the only place that is colour full in the game is the 'mall' where you buys cloths and such -the game play is boring -ALL the cars handle like â¥â¥â¥â¥ -Mission Spawn system is broken and can lead to many spawn kills  -Mission arent that uniqe or fun  And this part needs its own place this game is complety PAY TO WIN you get all the best guns in the game by paying real money so basicly one guy will come buy every thing and destory EVERY ONE who is free to play   So I did not like ABP Reload once again the concept was good but had been done before and better is they wanted to base there game off of a good version of there concept they should have gone with gopham city imposters as that game was colour full, fun and did this concpet very very well so unless your willing to shell out a bunch of moeny i would not recommend
1191	1	a	Pros 1. Love the Customization even for a Free Account (9.9/10) = Not cause I'm free (There is a Limit (3), The Video is showing you a Premium Account(50)), but cause I thought clothing was more modular (And trust it is already pretty modular, reminds me of NFS Carbon and the Customization is so good it can be a game on its own)    Example of What I thought Clothing Customization would be = Shirt: Collars/Cuff Type, Collar/Sleeve Length and Collar Form; a Deep V-Neck with Fur Collar, Tight Long Sleeves (Upto Wrist) and Puffy Rounded Fur Cuffs --vs-- Tight Open Turtleneck (Under the Jaw) with Button/Latch Collar (Similar to Motorcycle Bike Rider Jacket) and Sleeveless/Shoulder Length with Ripped Cuff (Similar to Ryu from Street Fighter) (For Cuff Types Google 302444931199841460 ) = Shoe's Length, sole or toe/heel type: High Feel Sneakers vs Clown Boots (Kingdom Hearts), Spiked Toes/heel vs Open Toes/heel (Naruto) = Gloves Length (Half of Palm, Wrist, Elbow, Shoulder), Finger/Knuckless (Which Finger(s)), Palm/Back hand less (Size, Shape), Wrist/Finger Trim/Cuff (Ribbed, Zipped, etc) = Holding style as well (There isn't Dual), but Shoot the weapon the way you want     2. Love the Controls as I use keyboard (8/10, but need some buttons to overlap specific controls like Turning the Camera On Foot, but not while Driving)  3. Love the GTA Feel (9/10, Commandeer or Hijack Vehicles, but sadly only 2 weapons are allow to be equipped at once and there isn't dual Wielding)  Cons 3. The thing I like the least is the Tutorial (5/10) as I will not gain money and there are no NPCs. I'm stuck trying to find the Evidence Vault -some places are hard to find- need indication of which door is usable and step by step of where to go ( Highlight the Area/Path or Place it somewhere easy to access)  4. Jumping and Climbing is in, but its predetermined (So those walls you can almost make it over, you can't), and there are so many doors to go through
3388	1	a	RON IS â¥â¥â¥â¥
1324	1	a	Really nice graphics :)
5391	0	a	5 years later and this game is still garbage.
2012	1	a	Similar gameplay to GTA but with a little better competitive plays. Though the bad side is that low rank player can get to match up with higher rank opponents
10086	1	a	This is a really god post apoctalyptic MMO.Its often fun and interesting especialy if your playing with some friends.Its like a mashup of fallout 3,minecraft and an MMO.Its a fun game and i would give it a 9 out of 10 and i recommend it.
7838	0	a	if you are from egypt dont download this game because there is no world is near t you so you cannot play you will just be able to custom a characters
2294	1	a	10/10. Everyone is a hacker but i keep comin back.     ....Help me

7177	0	a	There's Hackers everywhere, pay to win, people with auto aim mods and I get banned for cursing while these kids walking with moded guns. Dont play this unless you into getting destroyed by hackers and paying players.
2449	1	a	Boss of a game!
9562	0	a	Pat to win, graphics are terrible, damage output is terrible, doesnt explain how to do anything in the quests just plops them on you, takes an hour to download on steam and then two more hours to download the game in the launcher, wouldnt recomend it to anyone unless you like all these things in you game
7367	0	a	The loading takes so long and the updates are terrible. Control scheme is horrible and even on high graphics isn't the most good looking of games. Also Gameplay is not really that fun and the Character Creation is horrible and sometimes not fuctioning proberly. You might as well get money in your steam wallet and buy any of the GTA's out there.
1029	1	a	it is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

9257	0	a	Fallen Earth at first glance seemed like a good game, and it seemed to have a a good story, but it's gameplay is something to be desiered and not worth the time to download.
5235	0	a	To me is the game not working
8724	0	a	the game is great when the devs cared. they promised the pc community an updated engine of the game . still never got it all they want is more money and there goes their loyal players. the EU got the engine upgrade which makes me believe they don't have enough funds to make an engine upgrade to the US since they stalled it and recently came out with the xbox one version of the game. makes me believe their going to try to milk money from the xbox version and upgrade the US engine with that. this game is struggling to survive against GTA. this game has potential but its help back by a crappy dev team that only fueled by greed. they are also not so transparent about anything , its clear and thats why people left this game. the game is not bad if your new to it, but definitely don't waste your money here its not worth it, i made that mistake and regret it. game is worth playing though lots of fun especially with friends.
4731	0	a	This is pretty much just a poor man's GTA Online.
10749	1	a	Airquotes that are so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing huge around ''free'' that you can see them from space
8179	0	a	Ultimately, the cons outweigh the pros in this glitchy, slow GTA-Wannabe.
9917	0	a	They would not give me a motorbike 0/10  but in all seriousness this game is horrible.
8678	0	a	I dont have that many hours put into APB when I wrote this review. But from the time I've played APB at the lowest graphic settings and with 20 FPS I currently think its a decent game. It IS ONE OF THE FEW games that allow you to customize the absolute hell out of you and your cars. The combat system is OK, although infinite stamina isnt that realistic. 'Headshots' do the same damage on your head and your foot, which disables headshot instakills, sometimes good, sometimes bad.  Now about the buying system in APB. You buy a guy in the game, a decent gun. Do you have it? Yes, for 10 days. ARMAS marktplace, you can buy quite a lot of decent and nice stuff. Like nice packs which can include clothes, weapons, attachments, modifications, vehicles and emotes. BUT the best guns in the game you HAVE to buy with REAL money. Which makes this game lean even more to a P2W. Now if they were to put the best guns and every gun in the in-game shop which you buy with your well earned in-game money AND make them last FOREVER and not for only 10 days. I mean, you dont buy a car IRL to drive 10 days with it and then bring it back to the car dealer, do you? You dont go to the mall to buy some bread, eat it, then crap it out and then bring it back to the mall, do you?  I would give this game a rating of 6.5/10. It has amazing customization, an interesting server setup and a free-roam to mission 'map' but the developers are greedy, very very very very greedy. They want you to BUY somewhat EVERYTHING in the game to keep it FOREVER. Thats not how it works. Not at all.
7924	0	a	This game was the best ive ever played until they started rolling out the Pay to Wins thats when everything went to â¥â¥â¥â¥. i means really the matching making was horrible. people blatantly hacking, and the server lags. with the so much money they get on this game they choose not to fix it. i tried to tell them on facebook but they block me from commenting on anything they post. i guess they dont want to hear a fan of the game opinion about their game. i would have recommended this game in a heartbeat but now its just a Pay to Win Simulator
1622	1	a	i love to play this game 
3070	1	a	Be who you can't be.
878	1	a	Best third person game
7577	0	a	it sucks 
4164	0	a	I'll save you a lot of download time and stress. This game sucks from tutorial on forward.   First, the graphics for such a huge game are not impressive. It's basic at best, and the latency is horrible. How can you play a FPS with everyone on server having +600 ms ping? You can't. Uninstall reason #1.   The tutorial is horrible. There is a list of things to do, but nowhere does it explain what to do or how. You constantly have to press the 'help' key to review quests. Even then, it is confusing and boring.   So you finally complete some tutorial quests and see people driving all over, smashing, talking â¥â¥â¥â¥, being trolls. Now you have to observe a crime? I observed many, nothing is a 'crime' according to this game.   Sum up this game real fast.   A bunch of cash shopping trolls using the sand box as a chat room and abusing the imbalanced missions with friends. Why are 99% of the cash shoppers females? I'm guessing it's Napoleon complex inferior kids and ladyboy caitlyn jenner wannabes in a dead sandbox of very limited repetitive boring missions with garbage combat gameplay.   I was hoping for something more like Tom Clancy Ghost Recon with some GTA. Instead I got a old UT2000 generic gaming engine with runescape questing and combat.   8/10 waste of hard drive space 7/10 waste of download time 9/10 for â¥â¥â¥â¥ game of transgender trolls 11/10 would tell off the global chat before uninstalling again
10276	1	a	I RECOMEND THIS GAME HIghly as soon as i played it i fell in love ;) 
8918	0	a	If you like fallout, please do not play this trash. This is a terrible, broken game. Hasselhoff does not approve of a game that does not allow to actually edit audio. Some woman was talking and it was like a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing 1000 decibals.
10350	0	a	Well, the character creation was pretty neat. Sadly, that's the only part of this game I was able to experience -- as soon as I entered the game world, I was dumped into an angular white void and then crashed mere minutes later. Can't say I'm impressed.
807	1	a	Amazing game of pvp where friends and family will love to play!

3932	0	a	 Be aware i did not 'only' play 900 hours, i just used the regular G1 launcher the whole last year. 1500 hours would be more exact.   I also paid something like 350 â¬ over the past 3 years and i abandonned everything because this game isn't worth it anymore.  I deleted my previous review which has been written the 11th of december 2011 stating that the game was great.      'APB: reloaded' or the 'Ultimate money making machine'  
5049	0	a	This game is fun.   I am also a compulsive liar.
10233	1	a	this is and outstanding game to play its like fallout and dayz mixed together you can get vehicals to drive horses to ride go on adventures kill monsters other people on the server get guns such as ak-47s but in the game they are diffrent names rifles shot guns pilstols and alot more
555	1	a	for free you can't really go wrong....I joined, created my character. went in...tanked some team and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ them over and over with their decked out upgraded gear with my fresh off the bat noobie rifle.....i killed some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ named rhianna. it felt great...driving around mugging pedestrians, running people over and jacking cars...it's got all your basic gta needs.. enjoying people's masturbational conversation  in the social district while trying to edit my character has also thus far been a privilege in terms of losing faith in my ability to not want to find people in their homes and murder them in the most sadistic way possible....i'm talking peeling off toenails and frying the skin underneath with a blowtorch level of sadistic.
284	1	a	Like owning noobs and hearing people call you a hacker cause you can peak corners like Bond? Then this game is for you.
604	1	a	In order to be really good, you need to spend lots of money
1531	1	a	Very realistic game. Recommending it for everyone.
5425	0	a	Unique game and playstyle, weapons are great, systems and everything about this game is amazing in it's own right, including the asylum and baylift, especially the clothes, vehicle, character, etc customization. Although many problems do exist with this game such as including the matchmaking system. One other problem although I know of this game is that steam registers it as open even when it has been fully closed for hours, unallowing you to close steam without the task manager. All in all though it is a great game besides some capatability bugs with steam. You got glitched galore in the maps and everywhere else. This game when you look for problems, you find them. You have kids with rocket launchers surfing card and firing away at you. Missions are onesided and heres the big one.....ANY â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ IN A GARBAGE TRUCK CAN RUN OVER YOUR CAR, CARS AROUND YOU AND EVERYTHIGN ELSE RAMMING IT AND DESTROYING IT ALL OUTSIDE OF ANY MISSION SO YOU CAN NOT HARD THEM TO DESTROY EVERYTHING.....and it's quite annoying I do say.... also you need 400+ hours in the game to even have a chance at taking on veteran players who log hours. combat is screwed up with hit registers due to when you shoot depends on when the server is pinging, everything having a small noticable delay
10740	1	a	i like that you can get rare items adn i dislike nothing XD
1777	1	a	Want the most fun out of your f2p experience? PLay a criminal and don't do missions. You'll make plenty of money and not have to worry about level 1's with a '+10 Sniper Rifle of Colon Obliteration'. Plus hey, you can beat up civies and drive a fedex truck. Wat's not to like?
8383	0	a	kicks me every 10 secs
7885	0	a	APB Reloaded is personally one of my favourite game. You can customise your character and your car! The guns are quite well-balanced.  However, there are many issue that is a hinderance to the game. Such examples will be unstable latency where if you stay in a country far from the server, you will not be able to move your character and shoot smoothly as people who stay in the country that has the server. Another problem is the premium guns where some free-players and beginners will find themselves in a serious disadvantage compared to premium players who has wide range of guns suited to their situations.  APB is one of those games where it feels good to play at first, but as times goes on, you will find yourself in a battle of keeping your interest alive of playing the game.  I give this a 5/10.   -Kiro
7741	0	a	Awful, pay2win It's called reloaded, but it isn't much different from the buggy beta

975	1	a	The game is quite good if you have someone to play it with the vehicles are fun to drive gameplay is alright and the customization is awesome
10130	0	a	During my short time with Fallen Earth, I don't think there was a moment where I wasn't bored. One way of putting it is 'the game has a steep learning curve', but in reality that just means it has â¥â¥â¥â¥ controls and convoluted mechanics elsewhere. Bad, even for an MMO.
2595	1	a	So much P2W, not much fun.
5328	0	a	For 2 years now since i play this game, The only thing that impress me is the character customisation, other than that is all crap. You need to pay for cloths, bonus, and the thing is those premium weapon are much OP. This game is a pay to win â¥â¥â¥â¥. I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT!
5112	0	a	10/10 Drama Simulator  I wouldn't recommend this game anymore. It was good till early 2015 when they â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up the servers, the comunnity became bad and as I said the servers are performing horrible. Its dead. 
4259	0	a	Are the massive lag issues fixed yet?No?Are the ingame prices fixed yet?No?Is the game any better?A bit?Oh my...
789	1	a	one hell of a amazing game! it it a bit comfusing at the start but it will get easyer  they should have a ranking system so you cant get in as a noob and meeting a pro that has played over a year    9/10
7730	0	a	NEVER PLAY THIS GAME. So laggy at the sight of another player, you just stop moving. Not even fun as a joke. I have never played a game that was so badly made, problems installing and playing. It also uses punk buster, the worst piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ software there ever was.
1390	1	a	Cops chasing Robbers  or   Robbers Killing Cops  Nuff Said
2427	1	a	this game is great. Its like an online GTA. Its free aswell so its even better. Play as cop or criminal and roam the streets doing missions and killing eachother
4215	0	a	Pay2Win system of weapons
10589	0	a	Bring the old realm back, And â¥â¥â¥â¥ up the god damn multiboxers.
7351	0	a	Not really into it, played for an hour got bored cause I have no idea what I'm doing
2996	1	a	Very fun game so many gamemodes so you never really get bored :D
2131	1	a	wish this game didnt have as many hackers as it does. i really loved this game for a long time but it just got way too out of hand.
2314	1	a	Good game not as good as a GTA but i still give it a thumbs up but the only problem is the 30 mins it takes to load it.
9708	0	a	Game is horrible, not much more needs to be said
9245	0	a	Just play Fallout 3 instead.
4272	0	a	I have played this game when it was released. Paid somewhere between 100 to 500 USD on items, upgrades, extra's, you name it. I had a wonderful time playing this game. Until... I got banned. I sended a ticket to support and they said that I got caught cheating which is kinda â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t, because I was livestreaming on Twitch.tv and anybody saw how I played and how my opponents played.  I even sended the following proof of someone using an aimbot who had 51 kills 7 deaths :   http://imageshack.com/a/img922/9103/0DtOEP.png   http://imageshack.com/a/img923/1844/mMXMvK.png  But they didn't care. I checked for APB Aimbot on Youtube and I found tons of videos of people using an aimbot in the game and they still play in the game based on the date they publish their brand new hack video compared to legit players, paid or not paid for extra items, gets banned with no reason what so ever.  This was somewhere in the year 2012. 4 years later I write my review to help others not to buy this game.  It's up to you if you want his game or not. Check the reviews 15k positive vs 7k negative.
1154	1	a	Great game.
9841	1	a	Like an MMO Fallout game...hard to explain unless you try it yourself. I sorta enjoyed it for the hour or so I played it, so yeah.
2623	1	a	I recommend anyone who likes online games and a relatively large arsenal of weapons...
751	1	a	Not exactly Grand Theft Auto, but if it was, I wouldn't need to play to find out where it goes. The freedom to roam the streets as either Criminal or Enforcer is enticing, like playing Cops and Robbers except I actually get to riddle them full of holes.  Criminals can keep busy doing all kinds of things, breaking into store fronts and stealing merchandise, mugging people on the street, stealing vehicles and turning them into chop shops for a finders fee, making that money.   Enforcers on the other hand kind of get the short end of the stick. With few opportunities to make money outside of missions, progression obtaining better gear is a good bit longer, but without Enforcers, Criminals would have no one to fight. I think that Enforcers could use a bit more of a pick-me-up.  Guns. Honestly, outside of vehicular manslaughter, this is your only kill option, and frankly, I get bored with just guns. I would love to sneak up behind those Crims and put a blade between their ribs. So many opportunities would have been mine if there were a melee option.  Third person point of view kind of hurts the excitement a little bit, it's difficult to really pinpoint the reason behind it but I always feel a good bit more control in first person perspective.  Driving is a challenge, but I actually like it that way, learning all of the nuances to different vehicles, knowing when to start turning, take your foot off the gas, and put it back on to make that absurd u-turn, all the while laughing because everyone else is smacking into the walls, trying to catch up. Learning curves are sick...  Movement and running are okay, no real complaints, but interacting with the world? Doors, ladders, fences etc. is very primitive. You can Only climb from the bottom of the ladder to the top or vice versa, instead of being able to sit on the ladder from the perfect vantage point and open fire, or waiting for the perfect moment to climb that last rung. The only barriers you can climb over are predesignated chainlink and wooden fences so entries and escapes can only get so creative. Doors, you can only kick, you can't open slowly and maintain anonimity. The worst thing about it all I think, is that your name is brightly displayed over your character, even if only a hair on the top of your head is visible. No sneaking up in this game.  Story? There's supposed to be one, but personally I think it along with the missions and gameplay lack any real depth and character growth. It's basically glorified Team Deathmatch.  Temporary guns. To get anything permanent, takes tons of grinding. I'm not even going to get into this.  Customization? I think that Second Life could have done a lot better if they followed this games rules on customization, giving you basic shapes to work into your own design. This allows for great degrees of creativity, matched with a lack of graphic-produced lag, making for a comparitively fluid, yet personal experience. Just be sure to go into the customization with patience and a solid plan, and it'll come out great.  Pros  Customization Driving challenge Freedom to roam  Cons  Primitive movement Glowing names No melee Lack of depth   I think I'll keep playing on and off because it is a fun game, but I am actively looking for a replacement on my list, so let me call this a tentative recommendation.
5170	0	a	Pros:  None to fully give a â¥â¥â¥â¥ about.   Cons:  Everything in this game is based around taking your money. Very unbalanced pvp. This game was fist made from the GTA guys and then they failed and then Gamerloft and they failed and now the cherry on the â¥â¥â¥â¥ topping. Perfect World. (3 companies failed to make this a better game)  
8071	0	a	Game is hilariously broken. It's fun to play for a few hours while you marvel at the bugs. The 'physics' are absurd and worse than anything I've ever seen in a commercial game with this many players. You can tell they have the basic weighting or friction completely wrong within the few seconds and the masses of most objects are hilarious. Boxes work like baloons, etc.  Also funny is that civilians inside of cars you steal don't actually exist. So once you rip them out of the car they simply stand there and then disappear. You can cancel some actions in odd ways as well. This means you can begin stealing a car, stop stealing it - doing so causes the civilian driving it to disappear.  I find myself not playing the game much because it's more entertaining to see how they messed up things.  Oh look at the ground when you get a chance you'll notice it has lots of weird glitches. They didn't get the shaders for the ground right...
9978	1	a	Best MMO of 2015 10/10 would play again
1202	1	a	Nice game! if you like to edit your own character, This game is for you
6099	0	a	Just. Ugh.
3826	0	a	I don't recommend this game for the following reasons:  1. It's pay2win. 80% of the people playing have bought premium guns wich are overpowered. This game is just not well balanced.  2. The matchmaking. The matchmaking is totally awful and unfair. It is just not fun to play as a free to player.   3. The Arma's marketplace. Weapons can be bought for a limited use time, character life time, or account life time. Character and account life time guns are really expensive for a single gun. It's â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t.  However,  if you do have money to spent, and you're not triggered easily like me. This game can actually be fun if you have a lot of friends to play with. Be warned though it's a 50/50 game. And that won't change.
10116	1	a	This game as a single-player experience is rather bland and pointless, however, the exploration factor is cool.   PRO TIP: Play this game with friends. Call them on the phone and play it together from the start. The character build is pretty cool, but beware the fact that you can't change your character, so try not to have the same characters as each other.   Clans are completely pointless. Unless you have a friend-base of 10 people to make a clan with, there's no point.   Missions aren't so bad, but cooperative exploration is amazing in my opinion.  Other than that, it's not a bad game. I wish there were more games like this though
10625	1	a	If you are a person who does not like to lose everything from the slightest mistake or just a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ move, this is not the game for you.........In a lovely open 8-bit game where you could think things are easy then you find a path then a grenade happy medusa comes out of no where to kill you, then the biggest thing happens........ you start over again. Think before playing this game and be familliar with W-S-A-D movement......ENJOY!
10057	1	a	Amazing game, If you liked Fallout and/or Stalker, then this is the game for you.
3164	1	a	This game is a great game if you have the Patience!
3717	1	a	This game rocks and sucks at the same time! But i love it and i keep comin back to kill peeps :P &lt;3 it!
3843	0	a	This game has some good ideas, but poor execution. Whilst the ability to customise your character and vehicles along with themes and other things are very nice and have good variety, the controls for the vehicles are poor and tend to feel sluggish. Other problems that hinder it are poor mission opponent matching with it most often resulting in overpowered experienced people against newer, less well equipped people. This also is shown when a Gold Rank player is left to pay on a Bronze level server even when they should not be allowed to since they are far better skilled/equipped than what the server is designed for. Bronze should be for Bronze only, Silver for Silver and Gold for Gold so as to issue the best matching. Another issue that is prevalent is the way characters ranking is scored, quite often I will go Gold Rank after having a good few rounds. However, this will put me against other gold rank people who are leagues ahead in equipment and skill and leave me feeling frustrated as I lose due to being put against an opponent that is clearly too high a skill level for my own skills. Also seen whilst playing is the way the pay to play aspect causes imbalance in equipment levels. Whilst I do want to pay toward keeping such an interesting game alive, I feel it would be unfair to the other free to play players as I would then gain access to guns and equipment that are far better than anything F2P can access without having to grind multiple days worth of time to get close to having something similar. This is a clear example of Pay to Win. Finally, and most importantly, along with being the worst point against this game, there are just too many cheaters that uses hacks on this game, it's a well known issue but in the whole time playing this game, nothing has been done to stop it. Too often has it been the case I've gone to verse a team of criminals that quite clearly have players that are using hackers to boost there accuracy or take less damage when shot. This is quite obvious when you are two shot killed by a shotgun or pistol more than 100m from your opponent or open fire on said opponent first but discover that even after multiple direct hits they will kill you in three shots.  Overall, a nice concept with some good ideas but poorly executed with too many bugs and hackers.
2212	1	a	Great game, sort of. The guns are â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥, you could shoot somebody point blank in the head and they could turn around and kill you with their pay to win guns. A massive pay to win game, bullet damage of a North Koreans nutsack.
7	1	a	  So, after ~3300 hours i can definetly say that i am loving this game.  Shortly:  +Awesome designing possibilities! +Alot of people to meet +Ingame Market -&gt; Share of Designs, weapons etc.  -Servers are often laggy -Pretty toxic Community -Difficult for new players  Overall it's worth to give a try.  Recommended! :)
4410	0	a	Really wasn't what I expected honestly.
6034	0	a	complately â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t game â¥â¥â¥â¥ mechanics and it sucks Pay to win game -5/10
9889	1	a	Good points: A good storyline. OK FPS (shooter) Good FPS (frames) Good customization on characters. OK weapons.  Bad points: A LOT of trolls Tons of idiots A few glitches You can't get past a certain stage. It just crashes and I have a lot of RAM, storage and more.  7/10, tries to be Fallout, slightly fails, still OK game. 
6318	0	a	The â¥â¥â¥â¥? I didn't even play this. It was left on in the background without even a window.  
6808	0	a	1,300 hours later and I still manage to want to play this game. Customization is fantastic and it's one of the main aspects of this game along with the 'run-n-gun' style of third-person shooting. The graphics are unupdated, the optimization is horrible and has been for an extended period of time, the matchmaking has yet to be improved, micro purchases out of your â¥â¥â¥, if you have the G1C that is. A community of some veterens but mostly hackers and rerollers with 5 dollar wall hacks, aimbots, or a 40 dollar trial gun. The game itself is fantastic but the key aspects around it are dragging it down.
3785	0	a	got false ban reason falls in category of 'hack'? Â¯\(Â°_o)/Â¯          YouTubeâ¢ Video:  unethical FF bans&nbsp;
4267	0	a	The customization on this game is really good i must admit for quite an old game.  Pretty fun at start rekting people. Occasionally you get them hackers... not fun.  However, I really Hate the weapons that have this 30 day buy deal or Permenant deal for a certain price which then gets expired. It REALLY â¥â¥â¥â¥in sucks and not a great system imo. It also sucks how you buy a perk in the game; For example, the Car Sufer mod, when i bought it with earned money inside the game i was so excited and I thought it was permenant? But nope. It wasn't. It really sucked.. Quit after that happened.  You play deathmatch and people have Rocket Launchers = instant death. Not fun. This game has died out many years ago. Wish they didn't sell it to this new company.. But heyho.. it happens. Buisness is Buisness.  In the end, I played this game since the beta and just recently got back into it. I have 85.8hrs in total and I would recommend this game if you have friends its really fun. But soloing is pretty boring after a while.  Other than that I dont think this game is worth playing anymore. It has had it's chance and it failed.
8521	0	a	This game wouldn't even start.
8884	0	a	Fallen Earth is a post-apocalyptic game with sci-fi technology. It was released September 22, 2009 and with that said... Making a game with let's just go with a major title, CoD or Battlefield like graphics...It'd need a engine to process it and this is a game already finished. So the graphics are dated, even at it's highest setting can look like a mudded mess.  You know what, no, no, I wanted to be a bit nice to this game. Look at my screenshots. The mane of my horse, a free mount is beyond s***. Hell my shadow while in first person is cut in half at the waist, and there's no first person animations what so ever. There are in third, but that is just horrid. If that isn't bad enough you get spells and skills like in World of Warcraft..I'm playing at max settings mind you. There are no animations, effects, nothing like that for anything you use in first person. So I don't know if I'm using a poison spell or a spell that s***s f***ing rainbows. Should I mention if I try to heal while in combat that I'll actually heal my enemy? WHAT!?! Oh yes, you have to TARGET yourself to HEAL yourself.  This game is a hardcore knock off of Fallout 3 and New Vegas. The graphics are the same if not worse then both, huge lack of animations, glitches, and just awful, dreadfully poor, sloppy and LAZY design work. If that doesn't p*** you off then what about the fact you have to swap from mouse to aim every 2 minutes to click on a quest, item, object, whatever it be..Ending tutorials, etc.. Oh your mouse cursor is what they use as the game cursor. That's just f***ing pathetic work.   Another fun thing is crafting, and timers. They haven't yet, but I'm damn sure a single timer can easily eventually be an hour if not longer. By the way you can only craft ONE, ONE ITEM AT A TIME IF you do not buy their stupid VIP. Want more, I've yet to go into PvP and frankly I don't think I want to with the other reviews I've read. Already see paid content is able to move ridiculously faster, and it seems at best if you don't pay for the game you're getting a horse. My mind is just blown. That's just mounts/vehicles...What about these keys and boxes and crap that give amazing gear you CANNOT GET ANYWHERE ELSE?! No. Just no. It figures, any title under 'GamersFirst' is nothing but a pryamid scheme for your money. I'm dead serious too, look at APB: Reloaded and APB.  Oh and the learning curve on this game might as well be a f***ing mountain flying in the air. If it wasn't for having looked at my keybinds, and even then I'd be having difficulty as hell. Don't forget, no animations, effects, etc. with most spells/skills/s***s/f***s I don't give about! The game is about you though and the other 20 or so people around, you died at the Hoover Dam and now you're a clone. Should I mention everyone here and everywhere else f***ing hates clones? You might as well be a Jew in NAZI Germany. Question, what game allows jumping that can't allow turning while in mid-air? Answer, Fallen Earth. S*** YOU NOT. The map could be really big, the thing is though... I DON'T HAVE THE F***ING ABILITY TO SCROLL AROUND THE MAP.  3/10 I will never recommend playing this game, even to see if it's really that bad. It's worse.
5682	0	a	Matchmaking is very frustrating. (Two Silvers v. Two golds) Weapons feel unbalanced, and paying members are definitely the winners in this (Pay-to-win) Freemium game.
5398	0	a	If you spend enough money you can get guns that 1-3 hit kill where all non money purchaseable guns are balanced by themselves. It's Pay to Win, do not play unless you like that sort of thing
8746	0	a	doesn't work, so i reccomend downloading it from the GamersFirst website.
3828	0	a	Got 37.0 hrs by being stuck in a loading screen 10/10 would loading screen again
9200	1	a	Quite frankly, this game makes me want to sever an artery in my wrist, smear my body in â¥â¥â¥â¥ and feed myself to pigs. So deperessing and boring.
7539	0	a	It can be fun at first, but when you actually play it for a few days and try to make money get a decent gun. That's when the game starts to get boring, REALLY BORING. If you're playing as a criminal It takes hundreds of hours to make enough money, and theres a high chance that a cop might just come and bust you up then take all of your stash. There's a LOT of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s in this game, and if you don't want to always rage like crazy. Then this is not the game for you, it is not worth your time AT ALL. One more thing, this is a completely pay-to-win game. Where the rich players one shot you, and you're there shooting like an idiot. Even when you start shooting them first from behind, they totally got enough time to turn around and shoot you in the face. Why? BECAUSE YOU'RE USING A FREE WEAPON. Don't play this game!
4473	0	a	A lot of weapons are P2W and many say obtainable by F2P if you play long enough, but there IS weapons you can't get being F2P which a lot of people use and murder with, over all, if you want a good shooter, don't expect to be good even with amazing aim. :/  -Customization is amazing though, I'm sad it's crushed out by the horrid shooting mechs.
4415	0	a	APB is one of those game where you enjoy and like it but you still can't recommend it because it has some issues. I'm just gonna list the pros and cons so you don't have to kill yourself after reading this review.  Pros ======= - Customization, you can do anything really. - Ragdoll physic - You can play with your friends  Cons ======= - Terrible matchmaking, have fun going against 3 golds with 2 silvers on your team - Pay2Win effect is present though to a lesser extent - Unoptimize even after 4 years, one of the feats that makes me wanna jump off the Eiffel Tower - Hackers are present but not much - A lot of reskin weapons like seriously? - Where is the engine update? - Server can be a bit laggy at times (yes, I already check it. It isn't my internet)  TLDR ========== - Play the game if you want, I'm not gonna stop you. It has its problem but it's enjoyable, atleast for me, I suppose.
1637	1	a	yes great game has gun driving i love it cool im not rlly hard and it fun trying rob but rlly havent tried a cop but i love crimal it a good it kinda like saint row and gta blend in with other shooter games
3915	0	a	I left this morning to work only to be involved in a car accident ' not at fault' , I was rushed to the hospital and after exhausting day they found nothing wrong with me , except bruises and sores. I took a cab home,, unfortunately the taxi was rear ended, they took me back to the same hospital , the staff wasnt helpful, they laughed their â¥â¥â¥ off at my misery and that's not all, I now have a wrist fracture thanks to the medical staff for slamming the gurney into the wall,, and to all that. I still would rather experience this day then to play APB Reloaded again, this game is just awful.
2009	1	a	Was A Great Game! Yet, Now I Have No Reason To Play It die To GTA V!  Say Thanks To Rockstar!
3620	1	a	Hell of a game. mugging, robbing, and missions. Own this now.
4101	0	a	p2w with unfair matchmaking constant crashing on six core cpu and aim cheaters
6926	0	a	It's mostly pay to win. Sure it may be free but it is absolutely terrible.
7999	0	a	I really like the customization,but it's too PayToWin. You can't just spend 100$ on a game.
6577	0	a	Terrible game, terrible devs and lately have been banning pepople for no reason while being full of hackers avoid like the plague
2182	1	a	good game by gamerslast
7213	0	a	APB Reloaded is personally one of my favourite game. You can customise your character and your car! The guns are quite well-balanced.  However, there are many issue that is a hinderance to the game. Such examples will be unstable latency where if you stay in a country far from the server, you will not be able to move your character and shoot smoothly as people who stay in the country that has the server. Another problem is the premium guns where some free-players and beginners will find themselves in a serious disadvantage compared to premium players who has wide range of guns suited to their situations.  APB is one of those games where it feels good to play at first, but as times goes on, you will find yourself in a battle of keeping your interest alive of playing the game.  I give this a 5/10.   -Kiro
885	1	a	Second Life/GTA hybrid that allows you to be a cop too. Pay 2 be pretty not pay to win. EVERYTHING available in real money market is achievable in game, exception being aesthetic items (e.g. gun skins, clothing items, etc).  11/10 will fap moar  p.s. Waifus... waifus errywhere....
8207	0	a	this â¥â¥â¥â¥ took 8 hours too dowload and wouldn't even let me run it
10814	1	a	Pretty dope game
3597	1	a	this is a mix of gta. cod. and nfs. its amazing. the bad stuff about it is that it has bad graphics and {sometimes} poor matchmaking. also HAX EVERYWHERE THE ONLY WAY TO FIGHT EM' IS RUNNING ehem...where was i? oh.   yeah.   the market place has some dank player made stuff.  BUT the apb official marketplace [the gc one] is just overpriced. all the REAL DANK stuff is p2w. i did it. [duh] well its not OP but it gives you a slight advantage.
7799	0	a	this game is extremely play to win to the point where a level 1 can kill much higher level with there pistol that they bought
3705	1	a	A poor mans GTA V so why not get it right it's free doesnt have much game content but it is still fun to play but it does have some pay to win aspects
3885	0	a	If u want cancer  GO FOR IT  
1041	1	a	Love it so fun but aim is â¥â¥â¥â¥.
1129	1	a	i need an understanding of this game.. i just dont get it , but its addicting ,i have fun and frustraion while playing it for hours at a time..
5958	0	a	i hate this game to many errors 
9243	1	a	this has the makings of a good game, too bad the online community on it sucks :/
3793	0	a	G1 is a company run by money sucking vampires that only care about your wallet.
9177	1	a	I enjoyed Fallen Earth, but there is a lot to this game that makes me cringe. The crafting times get ridiculous, you don't get much help from the Help chat (if anything you just get extremely annoyed by the noobs asking how to ride a horse), the GM's act like punks as well as most other players, some enemies might be a little overpowered and may require you to bring friends, which are hard to acquire if you aren't lucky, and I guess you're not allowed to hold a ton of chips on hand...? I dunno, I had red chips in the mail and some on hand, but couldn't collect them. It's been a while since I played, so I don't remember everything, but I think I had to get premium to hold more or something like that.  It's not all that bad, though. It's good for an apocolypse game that comes with good ideas for character builds and such. I like that you can craft pretty much everything you need, but some materials are extremely hard to get, and as I said beore, the crafting times are crazy. FE is basically an apocolyptic World of Warcraft. Obviously not as big, popular, or 'fixed'.  7/10 in my opinion to say the least.
1990	1	a	Fun Fun..... not a lot for me to do like drive around since my Fps skills suck but its a fun game.
6925	0	a	still not better than gta I  this game is crap / this game is crap
1512	1	a	Its funny to do this game with ur friends , so dont play this alone.

556	1	a	In this review I will go over the basic gameplay and explain the Pro and Cons to this game. For a shorter review scroll to the bottom and read the summery.  APB is a MMO third person shooter based on the idea of Cops vs Criminals. Players queue for matches in district servers to do mini pvp matches against each other which take place in various parts of the map. There are 2 'PVE' maps and 2'PVP maps currently. The two PVE maps are the Finacial and Waterfront, each hold their own factions alliances in the district. Players either pledge to a specific contact to level up their standing with them or just play at random leveling up whoever is available.   Both Criminals and Enforcers (Cops) get their own specific gameplay that they can do while in the game. Criminals can operate burgleries by ramming into stores and storage units to steal the items inside,or robbing civilians on the street, then fence the items at their closest contact. Once the items are turned in the criminals are then required to go to the 'Money Launder' to collect the cash. Enforcers can participate in this as well, it is called 'Wittness Mode'. While a Enforcer is driving about he can patrol for Criminals commiting crimes and when he finds them he presses the Wittness Key, default Alt, and him and the criminal are now put into a mission where the Enforcer needs to get the evidence to the lock up while the Criminal needs to get it to the fence. This is a very unique system that is very entertaining and always present in the game. Enforcers also get a unique gameplay choice which is Less Than Lethal weapons. LTL weapons are the games way of making it more interesting and putting a twist on the game. When using LTL weapons, the Enforcer stuns the enemy and then arrests the Criminal. Criminals are able to free their team mates from handcuffs but only if they can make it there in time. The advantage to LTL is it makes the spawn timer longer, with the disadvantage that the LTL have a shorter range and require time to arrest Criminals putting the Enforcer in danger of enemy fire.  Being that the game is a third person shooter, the game is less about skill and more about placement. Covering corners and knowing the range of your weapons as well as how they fire can give you a large advantage over players who are simply pointing and shooting. The starting rifle both Crims and Enforcers start with is incredibly good, both in accuracy and power but it must be fired with control burst instead of full auto otherwise it loses it's strengths. That being said the game is incredibly unfriendly to new players, it has such a large learning curve that it causes most people to give up and stop playing. Because of that the playerbase is reletively smaller and all the players tend to merge into the 'Silver' districts which can cause unfair match making. New players should be recomended to play on the 'Bronze' servers until they learn the ropes better and are ready for the big servers.  One of the biggest gripes about the game is the cash shop, yes the cash shop sells weapons. Before you drop the game though you should know the weapons in the cash shop have very little difference compared to the 'free' weapons. Most CS weapons are infact reskins of the free ones, with the exception of the few that are special/unique weapons. One of the most powerful weapons in the game is also one of the first ones you unlock for free. Most of what comes out of the cash shop is cosmetic items that are for cars and clothes.  So now that we went over the basics and you have a little bit of an understanding of what you are getting into, lets get into the good things about this game. Number one of all time is, the customization. Free players are limited on how much customization they can do in the game, but even then I've seen amazing things come from free people. You can style everything from the clothes you wear to the logos on them, from the tattoos on your body to how fat you want to be. Customize your car, it's color, the model, the decals, the lisence plate, body kits, even interior design on some of them. Your weapons can be modifide depending if you unlocked guns with open mod slots. Do you like your gun shooting faster, more accurate, longer range, better zoom, better hipfire, bigger magazine, or maybe you like to carry more ammo. You can use mods to change that. Even with your car too, Nitro, Steel plating, mobile spawn, mobile ammo supply, or even have a brick that can be used when you jump out of your car to launch it at enemy players. Players can add mods to their character as well to carry ammo, be able to survive hits from vehicles, reduce fall damage, or even ride ontop of cars without falling off. The game has endless combinations and possiblities that you can take advantage of and have fun with.  The conclusion, if you can get around the very steep learning curve, get over the cash shop selling weapons and just have fun with the game, you will enjoy it. This game is one of the few games where customization is literally at your command. Dress as a business man, or run around half naked, it's your choice. Alter your weapons to your play style and make your dream car, it's all in your hands. The game is definately worth a try for people who like shooters, but remember that the game can put you in unfair match making at times. This is because of the size of the playerbase, the more people play the better match making gets. Those of you who just read the bottom and are thinking of trying the game, I suggest you give the whole review a once over to understand what I'm talking about completely and half some understanding of what you are going to be doing ingame.
1918	1	a	APB is a very fun place to play, fast cars, guns, and a cops vs theif none stop, gotta watch your back, Played this alot, will play more, been busy lately but look forward to the return of my cars!, I love making awesome cars for you guys!
7218	0	a	wow this game is garbage. i tried so hard. gg worst game.
3664	1	a	Nice game!
4282	0	a	Not even a single real content update since launch. Just silly guns who are recycelt from resources even the cars+kits  However, this game isn't pay2win. But 'Gamersfist' has horror politics. They just deliver guns every mouth witch are Overpowerd, so everybody goes buy a gun for 40â¬(no kidding). After some time, they start nerf these guns + release new one staight up.    Enjoy the recycle simulator 2010-2020
292	1	a	Driving a garbage truck on top of a garbage truck on top of a garbage truck is the best thing you could ever do!
7747	0	a	Generic third person shooter where people who've put more money into the cash shop than you will obliterate you instantly no matter what level you are, and where almost every item is temporary. Enjoy repeating the same missions over and over again. but relabled to get anywhere.
2123	1	a	Basically GTA: Online but with more general customization and less graphic capability and... the physics are not as good as GTA: Online's.
8250	0	a	well fkn funny i wainted for it to download 5 hours and it dont even work becuse my Grapic card is too â¥â¥â¥â¥ing good ... Not recomended it u have a good Grapic card ...
4515	0	a	Filled with hackers and doesn't even have a functional way to report them, bad matchmaking, bad quality servers, bad hitreg, extremely repetitive. Miniscule community. I understand that it's free and all but dang this is bad even by f2p standards
7280	0	a	could'nt figure out how to play?
8109	0	a	Just as â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ as the first time this game came out.
2299	1	a	The worlds truly most addictive game.
7834	0	a	Terrible matchmaking...nuff said
6404	0	a	This is the kind of game that goes goes Full â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
1452	1	a	QUICK RANT, PROS+CONS BELOW  The game is good, really good. I love it. BUT SWEET MOTHER OF GOD DOES PUNKBUSTER SUCK â¥â¥â¥â¥. 1st hour of 'playtime' - trying to get Punkbuster (APB's anti-cheating system) to work and not throw errors in my face; 2nd hour and the first half of the 3rd hour - having extreme fun, loving the game so much; the rest of my 'Playtime' - trying to get Punkbuster to work again, but I give up.  I really don't know why any game uses Punkbuster. From my experience, all games with Punkbuster have extreme amounts of bullcrap regarding being able to play (APB just confirms that once more). I'd love to recommend this game, but hell, I barely got to play it. And I will definitely not waste more time on it.  Pros+  *Really fun to play, there is just so much freedom *Has that GTA 5 feel to it - not exactly it, but something of it's own *Obtaining standart currency (cash) is pretty easy, fast and painless, so it shouldn't take you more than a couple hours (MAX) to obtain a new piece of gear *The difference between being a premium or free player is simply progression speed - and both are pretty close together to each other  Cons-  *As stated in my rant, it uses the Punkbuster anti-cheat. It throws up so many false flags that it's even pepe-worthy. That'd would be a really â¥â¥â¥â¥in rare pepe tho...I gotta make that now *Some guns are just straight up better than others, and there's nothing you can do (only exception being your and your enemy's reaction times - that alone can sometimes kill you or the enemy) *It appears that headshots are not a thing in this game. Heads have no model, so good aim isn't rewarded all that much. As an FPS vet, this seems really weird to me  CONCLUSION  This game is great beyond 'it shows potential', it is so much fun even if you're alone (with friends, it is CONSIDERABLY more fun though), but Punkbuster and some minor balance issues are holding this game down. If you have a pretty good computer and Punkbuster doesn't drown you in errors, I can GUARANTEE you'll enjoy this game (at the very least).
3090	1	a	GTA Online before it was cool.
6639	0	a	i play this game often but its fun, but there is one major thing i dont like in a PVP F2play. ITS A â¥â¥â¥â¥ING PAY TO WIN. There is no form of pve(maybe a bit for crims so mug and steal) like there is nothing to fight when you aren't in machmaking. (oh and before i forget SPEND 1,000+ DOLLORS TO INJOY THIS GAME IN PVP). The matching in this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ gold like to farm kills in new and bronze lvl sever(G1 fix that) most thing in arms is over priced and OP(i TRIED some) there is also lots of grinding for f2p players. And let me not forget. I HAVE NEVER SEEN SO MANY â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ IN ONE VIDEO GAME AT A TIME ITS SAD ALL THEY DO IS TALK â¥â¥â¥â¥ AND GO AFTER NOOBS. AND THEN INSULT YOU ITS SAD. Oh and dont get me started on bountys. &gt;_&gt; thats all i gotta say(wen you have a bounty no one can help you now kiddys .-.)  Now some good things(the few reasons i keep playing this game BUT havent spent a peny on it). The costumisation(it also has cons on to it). It is nice the fact you get to costimize your character BUT for F2P platers its limmited.   THE CARS(I LOVE MY CAR &lt;3) cars they have nice cars in game when you unlock them. (as a crim) MUGGING AND STEALING-FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN, BUT hold up there are some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥(if the car isnt owned by you) who will take from that car you stole and stored stuff in. They can also blow it up even if its yours or not. NOW FOR A LIST OF MORE CONS IN GAMEPLAY #1-Hit box-delay #2-aiming-SHOOT INTO THE WALL WILL YAH #3Cover-DONT HIDE FROM A SNIPER BEHIND A CAR they can still get ya #4-Pay 2 Win- OP guns in arms anot enough good ones in game #5-SSSPAWNING(more in fight club) GET READ TO BE STAWN KILLED #5-The matchmaking- unfair matchup (one team new players other golds). #6(im not to sure on this one) HHHHHHHHAAAAAAAXXXXXXX-from what ive heard that is. although ive seen some imposible stuff(no not like 360 noscope like in cod like shooting through walls always knowing where you are aimbot(i think)).  Over all I would recomend it but it has alot to fix, so its up to you if you wanna play it. And plz try to have fun dont take anything sereusly mainly because its a game.   (i just want car parts new clothes and drive around fancy looking is that to much to ask in a game).   (i am sorry for my spelling)   5/10
8913	0	a	The microtransactions are unbecoming. The community is mixed, some trolls some helpful, and the gm's, on average, are over zealous. I had some fun while playing, but making a purchase is the only reason it was playable. I have an acquaintence who RP's and they really enjoy the game and has made no purchases, however, they recieved the perks of males being nice to a female. While I know what it is now, and I wouldn't waste the space on my drive knowing what I know, I'd still suggest that if you're curious find out for yourself.  *Update: My characters have been deleted while that could be due to inactivity my g1c purchases are forever gone. Caveat emptor I found out about the missing characters when I logged in on my female acquaintance's PC.
9711	0	a	This game is probably the WORST game I have ever played, I played DOTA and Clicker Heroes. So first of all let's recognize what is good in this game. The Storyline... That is literally it. Oh wait! There is... Nope, nothing. Nothing else at all. First of all, there is absolutely no fighting audio... Not even a gun sound or a cutting through the wind sound when you swing something... BUT there is a death audio. That doesn't even make sense actually, no fight audio BUT HEY LET'S MAKE A DEATH SOUND! Literally hated this game, especially since I spent about eight hours installing this game and then another hour and a half doing the wierd thing it does when you first start up. Oh and I forgot it DOES have two good things, it runs pretty well on my brothers crappy computer but the install took forever on my alienware.... I hate this game and I unistalled it as soon as I couldn't take it anymore.
10446	1	a	It's a great game, and requires a lot of teamwork in the late-game. But unfortunantly after it went F2P the flood of CoD 10yr olds came and destroyed it, just like every other F2P game. I love this game and will stick by my decision to thumb up it even after the disaster we might call Jarod Fogel's Basement has happened.   Now then on to the actual review.  Pros -  Introcate crafting system, it takes time and rewards patiences.  Talent system, Extremely confusing at first, but with help you can master it and create the ultimate player.  All in one style of gameplay, You are able to meld your character as you see fit, make him a Melee, or Gunslinging Dual Pistols, or even a high powered rifle.  Helpful Community, (Please keep in mind this used to be at all levels, but has receeded up into the extremely late-game due to 10yr old activites) Many players that I have met throughout my gameplay have actually given me the shirt off their back. That's right... Literally.  Cons -  10yr olds... 10yr olds EVERYWHERE!...  Minor glitches with mob pathing  Headshots don't register EVERY headshot.  And other than that I got nothing... Oh did I mention the 10yr olds swarming everywhere but the gang territories?
9743	1	a	I can ride on a chicken. 10/10

5185	0	a	This game is a piece of souless garbage. I rather stare a garbage can on a hot day then play this filth. Amen
2829	1	a	This game is like gta 4 but online mmo. so you chose Criminal or Enforcer?
5608	0	a	Whatever you're thinking of doing with your life...Searching through free games or any other kind of games...Install ANY but not this game...This game has officially been overrun by hackers, it was once a good game (2010-2013) but now it's dead to me deep inside...DONT INSTALL THIS GAME.
2112	1	a	Fun if you have people to play with :P
9723	1	a	Fallout Online confirmed!
6679	0	a	Cool customization and stuff. But it's probably the biggest steaming pile of garbage i've ever played. With the time i've played i've been plagued with lag and shots not registering... It also runs like â¥â¥â¥.
7253	0	a	Me and my friend tried playing it , well wasn't very fun . P2W
7554	0	a	Pay to win... Just: 'Pay to win'...
5289	0	a	Pay to get better weapons  Pay to customize more on your car  Pay to Win  And lag as f*ck while doing that
7355	0	a	this game was bad when it came out and it still is. too bad, good idea, just done horribly.

7419	0	a	No.i refuse to waste my time talking about this game.now go away and pirate a copy of another open-world game
7953	0	a	Such potentional in the launch, now they've â¥â¥â¥â¥'d it all up. Remember when this game had to be bought retail for 60 bucks? Now it's F2P and guess why.
6076	0	a	DONT BOTHER SPENDING YOUR MONEY, I HAVE ENCOUNTERED THE AIMBOT HACK MYSELF FOR A TEST RUN.... GM'S AND ALL OTHERS DONT CARE WHO CHEATS, THIS GAME HAS GONE TO â¥â¥â¥â¥... SAVE UR TIME &amp; LIFESTYLE HABITS.
5577	0	a	For some people this game laggs... More enforcers are more stronger than Criminals for some reason... Fix the car glitches/bug-just a preiared car... i touch another car and its smoking.... The aim shooting right at the body and doesn't count or shoots in an other direction... Too much rage...(on the Criminals side Of Course) Too many hackers,idiots,teamkillers... Almost a P2W-Pay2Win game.  Not even going to recommend to play this game....
6144	0	a	Do not install this geam. save your time. its a huge pay to win only . you cannot shoot anyone with ingame currency bought weapons.it hasnt changed in 5 years since the first company went bankrupt. piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥.
9649	1	a	10/10
6107	0	a	As soon as i start playing the first mission, Grenades start flying onto me like they were bullets. Worst game experience ever.. Get your Anti-Cheat fixed..
2397	1	a	This game is amazing in every way. I recommend it because it is one of the best shooters out there, lets you customize anything you really want to: Cars, Character, Clothes Etc. If you're into the CoD series, you just might like this game although its not really like CoD, it's fast paced battles with Enforcers, (Cops) Versus Criminals. This game is not, however P2W(PaytoWin), but if you do play it P2W you might have an advantage over other players. This game has been INFESTED with hackers lately, I would not reccomend it Atm(At the moment).  I currently have an R229 Criminal on Colby(NA WEST) The name is SeemsLegitBro
438	1	a	i havent played it bu ive seen my friends play it and i recommend you to play it its awesome! belive me :D thx! 
3551	1	a	I love this game cuz ist very good and fun to play alone or with your friends
10712	0	a	This game relies on heavily overpriced microtransactions, and is completely pay to win. I have not spent any money on it... SO WHY IS IT SO ADDICTIVE???
7806	0	a	high population servers lag.the slowest loading game ever hit detection needs work.pay to win.....
166	1	a	I have been playing APB reloaded on and off steam for a while. I will state the following:   PROS:   If you enjoy enhanced character customization and opposing enemy players in non-stop PVP this game is for you. The detail of character customization, Vehicle customization, Clothing retexture is abundant, Moreso than most MMO's I've ever played. atleast one server seems to be densely populated at all hours of the day, There are always players online. You get a fully customizable soundtrack to play from your vehicle. The open world crimes and witness events give the game play immersion.  CONS: There are hackers who use aimbot sometimes, Allthough most get banned with the new anti-cheat system some bypass it or return on a fresh account. When you're a low level in the bronze district as bronze threat level, Gold threat level players equipped with preimum gear will camp you and kill the crap out of you, you'll be lucky to last five seconds without being picked off after respawn in some matches. As far as the community is concerned, Like most MMOs or FPS's Such as Call of duty or WoW, Players can be really disrespectful via district chat or mic, predictably Some can be very cancerous and toxic with thier insults and PM's, These players are usually team killers and generally will try to bring down the whole team, Not that I care but people who aren't like me who aren't desensitized to it will. Not that i'm sure it matters in this type of game, But there is no RPG element to the game, You'd have to think, There are NPC interactions in this game verbal and physical, Mugging, Diolouge, Contacts, Mail from contacts. Why is there no NPC missions or PVE? I'd probably play this game A lot more if it did have an RPG element to it and Solo missions. Sometimes I don't want to PVP, the same routine kind of gets boring after a short wile.  Conclusion: Despite the cons, I'd still reccomend APB reloaded. After all it is ranked #1 in most top 10 character generation videos, I have a lot of fun doing open world crime or when on my enforcer arresting players who commit crimes. The game itself is more adult oriented and more to my level of prefrence, Something you rarely see at all in today's games.
8569	0	a	The admins are clueless, the mods who are not employed with the company are ignorant, the cheaters have taken over the game, Deep Silver is ruining their game, the admins are nowhere to be seen, the only employee who appears to have any form of discussion with players is CM Tiggs, i never met her, even though when i was a GM/CM over at T3Entertainment, i heard she use to be a CM with HanbitSoft, even though I'm not sure if that was true or not. I have nothing against her personally, but she needs to do something with the forum mods and get rid of them.   Depsite the BS. I click no on recommend 'in general'&gt; But read below , because despite all the crap with this game, I'm not against anyone playing it. But listen good, DO NOT GIVE MONEY TO THIS COMPANY MONEY. Everything i mention above , they don't deserve our money until they do something about the things which i mention. And until the cons below are fixed.   NOTE: IF ANYTHING IF YOU MUST , DO GIVE MONEY FOR PREMIUM, ITS THE ONLY THING WORTH BUYING. BECAUSE WITHOUT PREMIUM THE GAME IS POINTLESS TO PLAY. But read below about that.  Pros+ Intro Music  Character Customaztion Car Customzation Music in General Feature to add your own Custom Music Driving around  OCA Whipser is very nice gun to use.  Cons- The game itself Gameplay is boring Missions are repetitive Only 2 maps They removed the old threat system which made the game run, i told them once they removed it, it will runied the game and lose players . As you can see they didn't listen to me lol.  Game popluation is very low Downgraded graphics Cheaters/Hackers Everywhere Lame Anti-cheat method Lack of GM's Firing Good GM's Fight Club Mode is lazy, which means, instead of them designing new areas for FC, they took the main 2 maps and use some of that and made that into 2 Maps. Now that wouldn't be a bad thing, if they added new areas/maps every 6 months. But its the same 2 FC Maps for what 4 years now. Very very Toxic Community, never add friends you don't know IRL, never group with anyone, never trade with anyone.  No PVE Only PVP Macro users Closet Hackers Corrupt GM's( now ) Forum is toxic due to mods not being employed with the company. Tech Mech honestly should be fired becasue of this. He's letting people who are not even employed with the company run his forum. But wait, Where is Tech Mech? Nobody has seen or heard from him in months.  Asylum after 5 years still not completed The main 2 maps are still unfinished. Very poor performance Without premium game is pointless to play  ...................................................  Bottom line: If you choose to play this game, you will get bored. Its like GTA but done in a very poor way. David Jones the Creator should be glad he left. Do not give money to this game. And oh yea, there's suppose to be a engine upgrade coming out, but the staff never listens and due to some NDA ( Which i highly doubt is in place ) they can't show anything. But wait, they already show 3 videos and 15 pictures. But now they can't show anything lol. So play this game, but never give money to them, if you must though, find alt ways to earn premium, or if you must, only buy premium and nothing else and use the market to get things you want. The market in game.   Such a great game years ago. My advice, and i strongly suggest you do this for the best alt for APB:  Saints row 3 and 4 Hellgate London (which has even more customaztion compred to APB) Sleeping Dogs Crackdown 3, which is being worked on by RTW staff and Dave Jones himself.  NOTE: I have no inteintion on fully coming back to this game until i see what the engine upgrade is going to be like. If they didn't add blue tracers back, the old threat system or 'more importanlty' HQ Bloom, I'm never coming back.
3468	1	a	See, I love this game. It's kinda like a GTA V without homes, and where you get to play on both sides of the law in a city that has abandoned hope.  It that doesnt sound cool idk what is. The matchmaking could be A LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT BETTER THOUGH. I only recommend because it's fun to play. I only put that in because tha matchmaking is utterly terrible.  Other than that, it's great imo. 
4767	0	a	R.I.P. APB. It was one of my favorite games despite never spending a penny. From the reviews I am glad I didn't. We all got â¥â¥â¥â¥ed about as badly as Payday 2 players did recently.
6622	0	a	Has potential, but when you can't even leave the tutorial because the enemy team all have pay-to-win rocket launchers the game is unplayable. Stay away unless you feel like â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ out untold amounts of money just to exit the tutorial.
7728	0	a	What a piece of crap. It was free to play and I somehow wasted money on this game. :P Actually, it was trying to install the game. never actually 'played' it.
9481	1	a	There is a lot wrong with it. Enemy AI is terrible. The faction system, what was once its greatest strength, has been neutered into non-existence. But if you like crafting, like the open post apocolypse world, like the idea of a genuine RPG FPS MMO without tab-targeting, this could be for you. And it is FTP, so you have nothing to loose in trying it!   (The only real limitation on FTP accounts being crafting is slower and you may only craft one thing at a time).
5969	0	a	Great Game  But  So many cheaters...
9716	0	a	Not even worth downloading. Its impossible to play 5 minutes without it freezing up your computer. I even set a timer on it. It actually freezes after exactly 5 minutes of gameplay. Wierd.
8078	0	a	i played this game about a few months ago, and lets just say it was awful  1, the game looked awful  2, the most people you are going to see are very high levels that will pretty much kill you in one shot  3, you are most likely going to not even make it past the first mission  this game was a horrible experince to me and i personnaly never want to go back, the game was probably good 4 years ago but now its just a waste of time
9635	1	a	its an awesome free survival game were you can craft stuff,fight zombies , and do missions but the only problem is the tutorial sucks so if there is an option to skip it that would be great :)  
4554	0	a	Pile of garbage that people keep playing for some reason
10426	1	a	I like the post-apoctliptic style
7046	0	a	One of the worst games you ll ever play. Its a pay2win game. Even though it tries not be it just cant. Its also one of the worst shooting games i ve ever played, because when you are in combat jumping around and running around will help you avoid bullets as well shooting while zig zaging around the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ place kill the oppoment. Snipers are not snipers, meaning that they dont even have a scope. its all 3rd person everybody! FU SNIPERS! Also the fact with cops vs criminals is one of the broken pieces of the game. 80 people max in a server. Every other server is empty. Did i forget to tell you that you rent guns? no? well you rend guns, cars , and lots of things that makes you baddass in this game for the max days of 10(atleast for guns i know of). I would rate the game 20/100 just because at first i had fun killing my other m8s because they killed me while investigating. I would recommend not getting involved with this game. Waste of time. IGN 10/10
1018	1	a	Love this game!

4505	0	a	This game has it's fair share of issues... It's one of those 'Pay to Win' games with korean style web-browser RMT-shop. Hackers run rampant and even if you manage to play with legit players, you will be (Seriously, you WILL be. Matchmaking sucks due to low player population and crappy code) decimated by them because they are far more experienced and better geared than you. Also, you will get against clans a lot, so prepare for that if you are ever going to give this game a shot. It's buggy, it feels cheap, missions get repetitive after a while and everything sucks.  Well, not everything. I enjoyed thoroughly the many customization options APB has. Sticking decals to yourself and to your car is more fun than it seems at first. You also could do even your own songs and 'themes' using an ingame music studio. But don't get too excited, you are not going to be able to explore all of it - some extremely useful features are locked behind a paywall.  Bottom line: Unless you are ready to pay for 'premium' - membership (Yeah, this game has a 'subscription', by subscribing, you can get your hands on more content which you cannot access as a normal player) and for some OP-weapons (Which can cost as much as 40 - 60â¬ and more EACH) , don't buy this game. In my opinion, there are better things (GAMES) to spend your money on.
3086	1	a	this game is really fun i you can make your car make your own chacter you can mug people theres drug missions i mean the game is like saints row dont listen to any body that dosent like it they might be gay im just saying you can have clans gourps and â¥â¥â¥â¥ oh whatever you do dont pic cop its not that fun lol i made my chacter as a old asin guy thats fat and whereing just his underwear lol
8003	0	a	APB Reloaded is pretty much deviant art packaged into a .exe. I feel tremendous pain for those who have paid money on this incarnation of this game, which feels like a time capsule as there has still been no meaningful addition to what it offers players even after years of 'development'.  I made a Harlem Globetrotter though so I shall rate this game a 8/10.
10697	1	a	very fun game, but it can be rage-inducing when your character dies.
4165	0	a	Being that this is a shooter, I would kind of appreciate more button mapping options for controllers. The defaults are akward and clunky. And the tutorial is difficult to manuver when you are trying to learn the new buttons. So this one didn't last very long with me, even though I am aware that my opinion won't be popular amongst the MMO community.
9322	0	a	Terrible controls are clunkey and are some what delayed pros:  1. not hard to run 2.decent story  cons:  EVERYTHING ELSE  dont waste your time on this game
4302	0	a	Lets just say this is not the APB reloaded I remember...
2889	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME! this game is beautiful, you can create your own cars and characters, WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT! APB Reloaded is one of those games where 80% of people have spent alot of money buying cars and weapons which are OP, this makes the game hard to play at times because you are put up against people who can kill you with one shot. it would be cool if you could choose to verse people that are your level and have the same guns as you, so you are not getting demolished by the people who pay to win. But if you dont mind getting killed with one shot well this is the game for you! It is fun to just get your car and Drag Race your friends or Random people, and cause Havoc on the streets with you Dump Truck, speeding along the roads blowing up everything in your path. I would rate this game a 8/10 because of its massive selection of cars and weapons, and the amount of fun you can have with it!
3407	1	a	Let me start off with the word: 'wow...'  This game has stolen so much out of my time. But in the good way of course!  I have played APB: R for a COUNTLESS amount of hours. I met tons of nice people, that I eventually have become really good friends with outside the game.   The game has TONS of customization and replay value. The missions start getting repetitive, but the players and the gameplay of the different players make it so much different every time. I love it!  The game runs smoothly, but you do need a bit of a strong PC to play it. If you have problems over steam, I would suggest you to download the standalone from Gamersfirst themselves and add  APB Advanced Launcer  [forums.gamersfirst.com]  to it. It allows you with tons of more customization for your graphical settings than the game can give you. Props to the guy who made it!  Rounding up, 9/10. The game has its flaws, but I love the game with them. It wouldn't be the same fun without them! Cheers Gamersfirst for picking up a dead game and making it free to play! (the game died after a subscription model, but got brought up again)

9040	0	a	This game is terrible, it crashes every time you look around with the mouse, not the arrow keys. I couldn't get as far as Boneclaw Outskirts until I uninstalled this game after 39 minutes of crashes and little progress. This game needs a major update before I will try it again. Please fix the issues, and I may try it again. -Iraphoen
80	1	a	Now I know my hours of gameplay for this game doesn't say much, but hear me out anyways.  APB:R is an open world MMO where the players could either be the criminals or the enforcers. The roles are quite self-explainatory   The gameplay itself is quite what you would expect from any other third-person game, run to cover, peep out, unload your guns, that or you could just jump out and spray your munition and pray that it lands on the target. The gameplay however isn't what fascinates me, it is the customization option that you apply to your ride or your player model. You can create your very own designs from scratch, whether or not it ends up as tattoo or a car decal, the endless possiblity of creation is simply just mind blowing (Provided that you unlock all the customization option). As someone who studies graphic designs, this is my nice cup of tea.   Note: Premium players can put in more customization items on their clothings/car/tattoos compared to f2p players.  Of course, since this is a free to play game there are in-game items that you can buy to give you an edge against your opposition. Personally however, I think this game is still reasonable even if you are a f2p player.  The only downside for me is probaly the community inside the game. I'm not sure about the other servers, but the server I'm currently residing in is just..just.... full of twelve years old who are uncapable of listening to reason and logic. Oh yeah. Also expect â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s. Lots and lots of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s.
9127	0	a	10/10 Would uninstall again!
8737	0	a	Bad controller mapping  Glitch and Laggy  Crashed for me a lot
7465	0	a	Well, this should be nice, but it's not working on Windows 7 64 bit...
4948	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
3701	1	a	Don't know why I'm still playing it, but I am.      10/10
2014	1	a	i remember playing it a while ago, its amazing, it takes you HOURS IF NOT DAYS to costumize your character, then longer time for the vehicle and so on. 
6935	0	a	10/10 would uninstall again
2559	1	a	The Cops vs Robbers you dreamed of, but with less freedom and more trolls. The dress up is awesome, the combat isn't terrible, and it's â¥â¥â¥â¥ing free. You want it and there is no reason not to get it.
2825	1	a	um yeah i think that you should make it a fun game to play and get it to be have fun playing
3219	1	a	Makes me wanna flip off myself for installing it
1516	1	a	Ok, very nice, but when i spend 1000$ for ammo, i can't use it!
4937	0	a	Nothing more than â¥â¥â¥â¥, Sorry gamefirst, But your stupid pay to win system is too much for me.
6383	0	a	very bad game!! much P2W!!
1463	1	a	I've played this game so many hours (mostly before i have been released on steam). I have spent so many hours in the social district to create and design my own clothes and cars. To sell them for a good amount of ingame money.  But also the multiplayer experience is fun.  It brings some issues with it but i think it is still enjoyable.  Pros:  -open world -fully customizable cars and clothes -quick missions with a lot of action -aimbased shooter -a quiet nice community  Contras: -a lot of hackers -sometimes laggy -update dates takes too long
6888	0	a	free to play but totally pay to win
7120	0	a	10/10 would get called a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ again for learning how to play.
9664	0	a	one of the worst game i have played in a while and i did'nt even play it.i couldn't log in no mater how many tries i typed in my account don'tplay any more games made by the develiper untill they get rid of this gamersfirst bullcrap  -10000000000000000000000000000000000000000/10
10844	1	a	Man, â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game.  -reinstalls-
6284	0	a	The game wouldnt get past the splash screen. Yeah I googled that you could run the exe by itself, but even then it took a very long time to actually load so I didnt bother...
10469	1	a	I love this game! You scavenge, harvest, craft everything yourself. If you like post apocalyptic games. this is for you. Please dont think that all you do is shoot Zombies.. as it is not that kind of setting. The world was ruined by biochemical weapons and radiation. But if you want a fun free to play game, then come join the rest of the community!!
10359	0	a	Eh. Played for a few hours. Not as fun as I thought it'd be. Slow - paced, boring roleplay game. Not recommended.
3537	1	a	Seems like a very fun game, but every 5-10 minutes I get randomly disconnected.  10/10 would get disconnected again
4835	0	a	i have played this game for nearly 1000 hours. not on steam but when it was just by itself. i can say without a doubt in my 1000 hours, this game is nothing but hunger for money.  Dont bother playing. Pros - Variety of guns Variety of customisation of vehicles and character Fun in groups  Cons - Horrible customer service by APB Money hungry game No body cares about your opinion Hackers left and right Have your account hacked every few months and for APB customer service not to do anything about it. 
8798	0	a	This over all in build is a nice game really cool build and art makeing sytem to it.  But but the biggest problem so over looked is the pay to win if you pay for the over tope guns and then go to the low level zone its eays picking wich kills off new players really unless you have too much money in game and levels also there is no real balnce to the game what so ever.  In the end this game will make you rage quit its a love hate kind of one i hope one day the dev team for APB will think about fixing the problems and working on other elements too.
9206	0	a	When I saw this game, I expected to be somewhat of a DayZ experience to the extent that other players would be trying to kill you. I was very wrong in this assumption.   It turns out that the only enemies are the npcs. Speaking of npcs, they aren't even ok. All they do is walk around in a ten inch radius and will only attack you if you shoot at them or get really really close. Even if you're like three feet in front of their face, they will not attack you.    The weapon switch is also very finnicky. It took me five minutes just to get my character to dual wield. (that was either the game or just my lack of a good mouse   If you are looking for a game that has just an ok gameplay, I would bring this one up. But if you want a good survival game with good fighting and gameplay, do NOT get this one.
8679	0	a	this game. issue after issue. so, first off. after opening it the 2nd time. the launcher was scanning. infinitely. for god knows what. after disabling IPv6 protocol, it worked. but when i tried to launch game. it did absolutely nothing. well, it opened chrome tab, 'like us on facebook to get 1 day free premium' (big whoop one god damn day..) after pressing launch AGAIN. it opened a splash screen. then opened another one. after leaving it like this for couple mins. nothing. so far, from my experience. this game. not worth 1 hr of downloading. (5GB from steam, then came with 500MB update from launcher, which only downloaded at 25-50% of my max download limit..)  (as i havent been able to play this game yet. dont take in consideration of my 'do you recomend this game' as u may not experience this issues like i have.)
6766	0	a	The game has potential but like so many other Free-To-Play games it suffers from poor performace, Pay-To-Win players, and several game breaking bugs such as exploitable invisible walls and suceptibility to aim-bots amongst other hacks. The game has so much potential to be fun, and to make the dev's money if they would just put in the effort to make the game fair and balanced. The matchmaking system is broken as well. The district you choose is supposed to match you against equally skilled opponents, but in a world full of hacks cheats and obnoxious children this hardly makes a difference. You will get matched up against pros every time because they are the only players left as the new players get scared away by everything I just mentioned.
4082	0	a	If you like rocketlauncher battle world, you will like it. If you don't, then don't download this game. It's just a pay 2 win with brainless kids.
6713	0	a	Free 2 play pay 2 win game
8869	0	a	This was a tough one to recommend or not, but I'm going to have to go with no. I wanted to say yes, and I would have, only if the Devs paid more attention to newer people who play the game for the very first time. I will first start off with a Pros/Cons list  Pros:  Decent Graphics HUGE map Good combat (not just point in click, you actually have to aim and shoot) Factions is a neat idea ontop of clans PvP is for the most part, actually about skill Lots of things to do at max level  Cons:  HUGE map, but not much in it Melee is SO overpowered Can't trust faction members, you have half chance of them betraying you Not nearly enough support at lower levels (will explain later) Rude community GM's don't do much Horrible customer support (will explain later)  Now, when I say 'Not nearly enough support at lower levels' I mean that there has been so many updates in the game to keep higher level'd people to keep playing, example, the G.O.R.E. update (that whole update was a mess), while there's no updates or anything for lower level'd people, the game has a decent tutorial system, but just like anything, a tutorial can only help so much, you actually need to do it to get better. If you want to craft, you need to scavenege in PvP areas for certain things and people usually just camp there waiting for people to show up to get stuff to craft and waste them before they even know what happens. The economy is pretty messed up, ammo, which costs nothing to make really, is sold for a pretty pricey amount, I understand supply and demand but holy crap, it's hard to get money as a lower level so ammo isn't going to be cheap for them.  Customer support... It literally means 'customer support' if you're a f2p, they don't give a flying â¥â¥â¥â¥ about you, (it's kind of like TF2, if you buy a single item from the online store, you unlock things, such as no money limit and all that), in fact, unless you bought something or have a subscription, you can't even file a ticket! Even people who are paying a montly fee for the game, they barely care about you. GM's hardly do anything to help you, but they do throw bans left and right on a power hungry trip. The community is rude, 80% of the people there are the ones who have still played when the game is P2P so they thing they're better than everyone in general.  As for factions, there are Techs, Travelers, Light Bearers, Enforcers, CHOTA and I forget what the last one is called, they're kind of like hippies, anyways, each one has a natural ally and a natural enemey, Techs hate the hippies, but Techs are allied with Travelers, but Travelers hate Light Bearers, etc etc, but unfourtantely none of that matters since if you if you're a Traveler, you'll get freaking shot up by another Traveler, otherwise the whole faction thing would be an awesome idea.  I really liked the game at first, but it kept going downhill, the last thing I will say is the G.O.R.E. update, it released new weapons, a rifle, pistol and sword. Each one of those weapons were able to be upgraded 2 times, so it'd be rifle, upgraded rifle, upgraded upgraded rifle, but of course, each upgrade was harder to do, and the most upgraded rifle, could easily one hit kill someone, the DPS on the pistols (which shot in three burst (now fixed)) was insanely high, and well, for the sword, all melee is over powered so you get the idea on that. Some people made a clan to nerf the guns, some people made a clan to get rid of the update and killed anyone (the clan was always in a zerg) using the weapons, whether they were in the same faction or not. And then there was a clan that said to keep the update as is, and of course, they were using the Level 3 weapons. So they finally nerfed the weapons after about a month or so. Some people are wondering things like 'Why is he even saying this?' Well, I'm saying this because if the Devs released an update that had insanely OP weapons without even thinking about if it's OP, or to test it or anything really, It really makes me not being able to trust them with future content, and also, the only reason the nerfed it, is because people were canceling their subscriptions until they nerfed it  Edit: Typos and added a statement in the 'Customer Support' part
1540	1	a	Robbing people and places with your friends is fun, especially the ones who have been robbing the people blind. Some say we are modern day Robin Hoods and others they just dont understand that we have a choice. Newton once said 'For every action there is always a equal and opposite reaction.'. This is our reaction, am i a criminal i dont think so, everyone needs a job right?, we all need a Payday.
6491	0	a	This game is NOT noob friendly. in APB reloaded, there is no sign of matchmaking whatsoever. it just compiles a random clusterâ¥â¥â¥â¥ of people to duke it out. which means if you're just starting out, you could easily be placed against someone who's been playing nonstop for months repeatedly. I tried to get on my feet in that game for 3 days, but every cent I earned went toward ammo or was lost in deaths to people who play nonstop and pay actual money for the good equipment.   also, I dare say that this is the single most infuriating game I have ever played. even more so than Call of Duty. I don't get angry easily, but this game angered me to the point where I threw my mouse across the room and shattered the damn thing. So, here's a warning. if you're angered easily, AVOID APB RELOADED  It's a shame, because the idea behind it had a lot of potential. I was really excited to see someone finally making a game like this where you could actually be the cop with custom cars and weapons. It had so much potential, but the absolutely terrible matchmaking and blatantly obvious pay to win strategy ruined the entire thing for me.  long story short: unless you're willing to spend an untold amount of hours on this game, all it's going to do is infuriate you. it's a gigantic avoid from me.
421	1	a	I would have to say, deffinatly worth its price. unlike some other free games like warframe, its not nessicarily a buy to win game. and if u do buy, its a helluva lot more fun but whatever u do, buy this game! it's really great game, fun to play with friends, good gameplay but there are some minor tweaks like how many trillions of bullets it takes to kill, thats annoying but besides that its pretty fun. so if u don't have enough to buy GTA5 this is the next best thing so friend me if u want to play!
10100	0	a	WORST GAME EVER!! It's a piece of crap and poorly deisnged. It probably gets funner at higher levels but it takes forever to get there. it's a waste of space on a computer.
10500	0	a	Micro-transactions became too dominant in the game's design and it's suffered greatly for it. Used to be a lot of fun, though.
4894	0	a	The game froze on me before I got to do anything and said I wasted a huge amount of time on it. Rating- -60/10 60 hours really?
4432	0	a	Weak gameplay, riddled with cheaters with no obstacles to stop them. I could literally download hacks and play on the servers with a very small risk of being banned. The devs are so inflated they literally boast in the chat that they have banned one person from the server. The gunplay is weak, vehicle mechanics are choppy, cluttered ui, difficult learning curve(minus cheaters) and looks as though they don't put enough attention into the aspects of the game that really matter. When they start focusing on improving the mechanics while also establishing a viable anti cheat then i will consider this game to be mediocore.
8682	0	a	i tried so long TO LAUNCH THIS GAME!!!! â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS!
5802	0	a	WTF why download from steam create an account on gamerfirst and download it again!! WHY?
7487	0	a	this game keeps on crashing and hanging i do not recommend it
5454	0	a	Sorry but this game died once GamersFirst took over. Even though I got over 300 hours, I just might play one more time. BUT this game is P2W so fucc that!!!!!!!!! HAHAHAHAHA REKT.
4185	0	a	I cannot remember EVER hating a game as much as this game. It was by far the worst experience I have ever had playing a video game. After reading the other bad reviews of the this worthless game, I don't feel it neccessary to go into details of why it's so bad, because the others did a good job of it. I just want to make sure that the idiots who made this game get another negative review. I only spent 5 dollars on this game and I have never wanted a refund for something this bad in my life. SKIP THIS GAME.
1285	1	a	i have been playing this with my friend and its actually not bad its basically a free version of GTA online or saints row with more customisation although this game relies on in game purchases you can still have fun i rate 8/10
9452	0	a	this â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game is so boringg i willl rather cut my â¥â¥â¥â¥ off the graphics are bland your character is so slow and right from the start the game overwhelms you
5237	0	a	Many hackers... but fun community
5001	0	a	After playing this game for more than 15oo hours, none-steam and spending 500$. one day upon logging in I get disconnected and the ban hammer fell on me, after contacting support and meeting a bot called Dastard who kept sending me the same and same response, I lost all hope of getting unbanned and decided to take my revenge by writing this review, donât get me wrong Iâm not actually going to bash the game or lie about it, just the plain truth coming from a guy who used to have 2 gold max ranks. This game has many glitches, its p2w not f2p, and there are a lot of cheaters. I personally could cope with the bugs, glitches and its p2win-ness. Sometimes can say I enjoyed them, found them funny, but the main thing that makes you want to rip your own eyes out is cheaters. Well on that subject, there are three types of cheaters, first we have low rank blatant cheaters who are really easy to identify and are banned in a couple of days, and then we have high level (mostly gold max ranks) closet cheaters that are unnaturally good and you just canât get to kill them. When you confront them, they say we are pro or we have ts or blah blah â¦ sometimes you can see some of them who got caught on  ffbans.org . Now the third and the most annoying ones are whitelisted cheaters, G1 actually knows that these people are cheating hard but doesnât do anything just because they pay them a lot of money and if you dare report them, they ban you instead. Call me a conspiracy theorist or nuts, this has happened to people I knowâ¦ they caught these people cheating on video and reported them and those legit guys got banned after 3-4 days âDUE TO CHEATINGâ themselvesâ¦ coincidence right ??? so in conclusion, unless you are a masochistic I donât recommend this fail excuse of a game.
10004	1	a	A decent post-apocalyptic MMO with a deep crafting system and a lot of content. Not really pay-to-win either. Definitely worth a try if the genre appeals to you or you want an MMO with something a little different to offer.
5089	0	a	I played it for 5 years.In the begining game was awesome later it was boring and full of hackers.. The biggest â¥â¥â¥â¥ is that u need to pay with real money for space weapons-opp to win.. As i told already game is full of hackers... The biggest one is that the game is not proteceted well i lost my 3 maxed chars 10mill in cash lost everything. Now im proud bcs i stopped playing this crap.. The Gamersfirst company only thinks about money u give...... If u pay them u r goood person if u dont pay u r no one remember that!!!!!!!
8045	0	a	Dislike It is so laggy its not my laptop not myversion of windows its the game it self
8805	0	a	This game si â¥â¥â¥â¥ too shooting.
9903	0	a	In the grim darkness of future, there is only war. But not here. Here, you will find a desolate land with funny people running around, lame excuses of a storyline, traces of developers' sloth and indifference, ancient graphics, grinding and... Long story short: I've played worse. But that's hardly a recommendation.
5821	0	a	This game is utter â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t.  Took two hours to install, with another installation not mentioned in the description... And then it denied my video card. I'm so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off with this game. I used to have this game on another PC, but when I reinstalled it on here I can't â¥â¥â¥â¥ing believe what I saw. Uninstall while you still can.
1160	1	a	240 hours and I finally got past the loading screen!
9666	1	a	i lost over a year of my life to this game
117	1	a	Another fun PVP action game, their is plenty to do, if you can find it. Also, finding competent team mates is sometimes a problem. The community can be rather toxic, though never as bad as LOL or DOTA. 10/10 Wish this version of cops and robbers existed when I was a kid and had more free time.
9648	0	a	I STRONGLY suggest that anyone who is considering getting this game should reconsider- oh it's free you say? its not worth the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing time. let alone your money- this game is so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing badly made that i swear to god it puts the developers to shame. infact shout out to the developers, dont make awkward controls, boring maps, and ridiculously patronizing intros, unless you are expecting money to grow on trees. played not even two hours of this game 10/10 would uninstall again.
4357	0	a	I played this game for more hours that I'm proud to admit (over 1000), even before Reloaded 'revived' it, and way before it was in Steam.  So here's my humble review...   THE GOOD
9032	1	a	This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing awesome!!! i Recommending to everyone to Downlode it, its one of my favorite games i`m playing but for now i have almost 2000 hours on this game and every hour i spent on this game worth it!!!! So guys its â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Free 2 Play guys!!!!!!!!!!!
1042	1	a	Not bad, Needs to Update the Graphics settings.
223	1	a	If you play this all day.....you need a live man!    PS:add me and i will play with you! XD  I need a live too. :/
10434	0	a	It is a great game that makes the aftermat of the apocalypse seem enjoyable with your friends and other people online. This game is great on the RPG side as well as the fact that its free to play is really a good spot for those who just wants to play games without no strings attached.  BUUUUUT the gtame is dead so yeah....I wish people would've seen this game when it was in its early days...it was like the poor man's Fallout 3...Because is was FREE
6124	0	a	useless â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. I CANT EVEN START AFTER DOWNLOADING
9230	1	a	The game is still alive, though it requires more players and better economy. If it were developed in early 2000's, it would have become the best game of a century
216	1	a	Trueley the Best game I ever played. It is not pay to win because you can play with the preset guns and kick â¥â¥â¥. I have over 2500 hours because it so good
1511	1	a	Its a great game *cough* If you do the missions.
5766	0	a	Pay 2 win...
4697	0	a	No real updates for years, mostly based on pay to win. Gets very repetitve, but a decent play at times. Community is mostly bad due to the fact that no one will show you any kind of mercy, but there area few friendly players who try help. I strongly recommend not spending any money on this game if playing at all.
3448	1	a	A non stop Cops n' Robbers game were you can be flanked by any location,customize you car,your character,your clothes and even make your own music!
5296	0	a	90% time spent in customization the rest to dieing to pay to wins  Time well spent
1575	1	a	i love the customization in the game 
2057	1	a	fun game but because of the Tweeny Bopper that play it and the de-threaters it can get on your nerves
4059	0	a	I have mixed feelings about APB. I appreciate that it's not another WoW-copy-paste McDonalds MMO, but I feel that some basic design decisions really hold this game back from being anything but frustrating. First of all, no story. I have no motivation to do squat in this game, other than 'just to kill people and get upgrades'. Second: pure PvP, and VERY imbalanced at that. There is no 'PvE' to speak of, and the PvP is absolutely lopsided, due in no small part to being able to BUY better weapons at EXORBENT prices. Almost all missions are PvP based, and the group finder has no problem pitting 2 players against 1, or 7 against 3 as I repeatedly whitnessed. There are just enough players PAYING for weapons to make most missions total blow-outs, absolutely unentertaining especially with the rediculously long respawn timer AND distance they put you away from the objectives. You spend more time waiting and traveling than playing the game. One hesitant thumb up, and one way down.  I've learned from APB and Dungeons and Dragons Online that I really do not enjoy the F2P model whatsoever. Either players are given rediculous advantages in gameplay (which breaks PvP games like this) or content restriction provides a lonely, frustrating game where the players are segergated by different levels of content access, as in the case of DDO.
3133	1	a	If you have some friends to play with, APB Reloaded gives one many hours of great gameplay. Unfortunately some decisions from the developers give a hint that developers' name 'Gamersfirst' leads to a false point of view.
5935	0	a	Hi all, this game is so much fun But there are Cheaters that have aim bot, speed run , more heal or infinete heal and gun speed shoot. yeas it fun but anty cheat thes not worck and can even report a cheater in game .

10352	1	a	Good Game. I Just Think It Could Been a Lot Better. :)
2104	1	a	Must try
10303	1	a	This game has really great atmosphere. That is because most of the content is ripped straight from the Wasteland/Fallout universe. If you ever wanted to play a Fallout-ish MMO, this is the best choice. It's more focused on crafting and the whole 'carrot on the stick' gameplay, and of course you can just buy the carrot. I really enjoyed the short time I spent in game.  I'm torn about this game because, quite frankly, the community is just awful. Instead of Zone chat like in most mmo's, there's a Help chat. It's filled with players that have been there for a while, but most of them have that whole 'elite' attitude. Help chat is supposed to be used for people with questions, thus the name. These 'Elitists' will use Help chat for anything they want, berate and accuse new players of trolling, then turn around and lecture everyone on the 'proper way' to use Help chat. The GM's are even worse. They constantly hand out mutes/bans, but ignore any complaints towards the preffered players that have been there for a long time or spent probably $500 in the cash shop.   Also, the GM's are crazy about censoring peoples' screen names. I had a name that wasn't even offensive, I played for a bit and when I came back, my name was Cupcake1244. Yes, if they deem your name offensive, you get to roam the Wastelands as Cupcake____. And you only get 1 character slot as a F2P player. I contacted a GM about changing my name and guess what? Oh, you can BUY a name change in the cash shop. $10 because you got offended for no reason? Hah!  Unfortunately, I'm the type of person that's going to argue right back with you when you're acting douchey. So I told everyone off in Help chat and am uninstalling :)   To sum it up, if you enjoy the crafting side of mmo's with a Fallout/Wasteland atmosphere, go for it. But if you're not going to spend money on it, I'd suggest that you keep the chat window closed and just chat with people locally. You're going to want to avoid these Basement-Dwellers.
5080	0	a	This game is jackshit. It is literally impossible to play, there are no instructions on where to go, I was lost like an asian kid at the Supermarket. Like oh my god, I didn't even know how to put on clothes. Apparently there are 2 sides. Cops, and criminals. I chose the Cops first because I was curious. I spent about 45 minutes in the beginning tutorial, because they didn't say anything about going to your inventory. I quit on that side, and I went to the criminals side. Even more confusing, as confusing as a Rubik's Cube made By Stephen Hawking with the Theory of Relativity. I just started the tutorial and they just go, 'well, do this â¥â¥â¥â¥ and play.' And they don't give actual instructions. I just spawned a tiny little smart car and started driving around in the City crashing into other players. This game is a pile of donkey â¥â¥â¥â¥. Don't even think about getting it. This is basically GTA's little autistic midget albino baby who is blind.  My friend recommended this game to me. We're actually not friends anymore.
2720	1	a	Greatest cops and robbers/gta style game of all time. Vast customization and utilization of diverse resources. One midgame-ending flaw: company abandoned its own game as far as rebalance and you have to pay to win at mid-game level.  Definitely worth a play but don't expect to love it as much as you want to love it.
8102	0	a	The game seemed pretty decent right off the bat. Then I played a little longer and realized, it is a rushed piece of crap that should have never been released. It has potential however thats like saying Michael Jordan had potential at baseball BS he sucked at baseball. The game could have been something much better. All I am saying is that if it hadn't been rushed and it had a little bit more put into it, is that it would be a great GTA alternative or at least that's what I think             Sincerely, AnTixRushed
5350	0	a	If you spend enough money you can get guns that 1-3 hit kill where all non money purchaseable guns are balanced by themselves. It's Pay to Win, do not play unless you like that sort of thing
7808	0	a	why this game always said that the connection lost ? my internet is fast enough to play online. and you never fix this problem ?
756	1	a	I like it.....its a more mission revolved GTA. And it's free... thumbs up!
1005	1	a	it sucks
9004	1	a	I haven't liked most of Steam's F2P games, but I was pleasently surprised with this one, I enjoyed it much more than I thought I would. I love how the game wants you to make your own stuff instead of looting or buying items. You need to scavenge for scrap materials and use other scrap to put together weapons, like a painball gun that fires metal balls. It's a really cool idea. There's still bugs that need ironing out from the Steam release but the game is worth a try, even if it doesn't look that great. It's free, so it's not like you've lost anything.
377	1	a	I played this game with 3 of my friends. All of us rage quitted atleast once.  Now my friends don't wanna play anymore :(  0/5 Pay to Win 5/5 Game 3/5 Overall After playing this game for so long, my doctor told me I'm a sadist.
3836	0	a	Do you love Forced pay 2 win â¥â¥â¥â¥ and a matchmaking so broken, you'll wonder if this was still an aphla? then you'll love this
7048	0	a	After playing this game for 1 year, I can honestly say that I am sick of it. In the beginning, I really enjoyed the game, simply for the fact that it was basically an online version of GTA (open world, stealing pedestrian cars, shooting, third person, etc). The customization in the game was what also kept me drawn to it (also because it is a third person shooter). The amount of detail you can put on your character was like no other F2P game that I have played. Plus you have the ability to create unique custom symbols, themes, songs and car designs. The gameplay is also pretty good. The missions are standard (pick up items, guard items, capture and hold the base/item). It's kinda cool how even though you are in a mission, you are still in the open world and still able to interact with others outside the game (like you don't have to go in a game room and have private matches). But it also gets annoying to deal with grievers and having players run into each other.   Of course with any PVP game, you will have players who are more skilled in the game than others. That's the reason for the player threat level (Bronze, Silver and Gold). There are districts for each of these levels, but of course players choose to play in the lowest district threat as they could (Gold players in Silver district and Silver players in Bronze district). I'm not complaining though because I am just as guilty of this (we all like to feel pro ^^). The weapons in the game however can be unbalanced. Those who choose to purchase G1C have the fortune of obtaining the latest (and most garbage looking reskins remade with some percs) weapons. But that's nothing new. Every game has it's share of P2W.  What I hated most about this game was the community. I haven't played much online games in general, but with the few that I have, it does not compare to the level of displeasure as APB.Of course with any online game, you get your share of trolls, douches and jerks; but this game somewhat gives the advantage to these people (for example: following you around with a car to grieve you, ghost your missions, or sit on top of mission items to purposely make you lose a mission). Not to mention if you are having some luck on a day and do exceptionally well in your matches, you are then insulted and accused of hacking. In opposition to that, if you do poorly you are also ridiculed for playing as an amateur and labelled as a 'noob' or 'scrub'. So no matter how good or bad you are at this game, you will face some form of harassment.  So like I said, I have developed an extreme dislike for this game. Or maybe I've been playing it for too long and finally become sick of it. It's still a fun game, even if it has it's MAJOR flaws.
983	1	a	okay, so, i dont have many hours but i will say this, it is a hit or miss game with the public so here is a list of pros and cons as of 2/23/2016 pros: the community is alot better now that bans have been handed down over waves and such, the graphics are great for a free to play and game play is simple to learn but hard to master considerably less hackers, still out there, but i see at least five banned every day by this new system 'fair fight' awsome custom jobs and such, and amazing artwork in and out of game, and awsome player made clothing and charectars to boot, (yes, even enforcers love the way some crims stylise  now that the pros are over, he are some cons  1. hackers, still, not as much, but still there 2. PAY TO WIN, gamers first prides themselves on allowing people to have a amazing fun time, even when your loosing, but 'why is this a con?' i hear you ask? because gamers first, like any other company, like jagex and blizzard, loooooooooooooooooooooooooove money, gamers first is just a bit more open about it, they cater to the rich with awsome cars and weapons, that to have them permantly, you have to pay around 20-30$ usd to buy, and in this game, they almost force you to buy them with irl cash, which brings me onto number 3. 3. expiring weapons, after 7-10 days, your weapon you bought from your contacts is unusable, no reason why, just it, if you ever wanna have a good perm gun, your gonna need to fork over some cash. 4. community moderation, No, i dont mean 'oh admin where are you, this guy is hacking' moderation, i mean fourm moderation, gamers first doesnt really have that great of a customer service really, just a few copy and pasted anwsers most of the time, but hell, most game comapny's do this,  so, in the end, my rating would be. 7/10
6275	0	a	,
7826	0	a	This game feels like the developers spent a lot of time and money on. Unfortunately, it also feels like they spent 99% of their time and money on customization and the other 1% on gameplay. This game doesn't get much from me.
5039	0	a	Micro transactions with a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game overlay. Another fine product by Sony Online Entertainment. 
6717	0	a	game will not even play, says apb failed to initialize physx??? game wont play at all. i have a gtx 980 i7 4790k and still wont play
3044	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ed Game
10563	0	a	This was an amazing game. Had lots of fun. I played over 200 hours of it with my friends (Browser version) and played it a bit on Steam.  Problem is, this WAS an amazing game. Since Kabam bought it, it had turned from F2P to P2W. And is now unplayable without putting any money into it.  R.I.P RoTMG
10353	1	a	I really like this game, it's just that it's starting to feel old and I want something more and something new. I can't find a game like this anywhere else and it makes me sad.
10141	1	a	The game is good, but it's nothing new. The downloads are a little lengthy but hey what mmo dosent have lengthy downloads/updates. I would reccomend it because it took me away from WoW for awhile.
10574	1	a	It's a really Great Game, and the statistics and methods of a Simple RPG Rogue-Like Are Made into this, its a really good way to tense players and also, you WILL DIE ALOT. It happens. But It's so worth seeing your mistake, and retrying it again. It shows you different ways to win. Its really Fun.
10862	1	a	I highly recomend this game if you like dying a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥on, losing all your stuff and having to replace your key board from pressing the Nexus hotkey so much. This game is enjoyable for all types of ragers. Please get this game a try it out! Before you max a character, just kill a worthless character first so you can know how it feels.
8979	1	a	The biggest downside to this game is its small community. It is a lot like fallout but with a much more explorable open world. Too few players. Give it a try, I't is free and you might like it
1337	1	a	This is a good alternative game that allows some fun choices in weapons. Not your typical MMO though however as it is more of a FPSMMO w/ max server sizes of 50v50 maps on missions and smaller on quick pvp style deathmatch maps. Progression through Contacts (Mission givers) unlocks differnt guns, vehicles and cosmetic items.
2039	1	a	great game
10787	1	a	Oh â¥â¥â¥â¥, I lost track of time.
3916	0	a	Awful game. This game was so poorly recieved on launch that the developers had to make it free to play to keep people interested. But that wasn't enough. They had to go a step further by making it so the only way to win was to buy weapons with real money. No matter how skilled you may be, if you try and play with the default weapons, you will be killed in .00001 seconds 90% of the time by a person who paid for theirs. That, and it lags more than GTA online, for God's sake.
2911	1	a	A fun pvp game of cops and criminals. Good f2p fun, with a few bugs that don't really take away from the over all experience
5280	0	a	Well where should i start.   1 off i have been off this game for 3 years To come back and be banned with a perma suspended account.   Contacted support Only to get tell to â¥â¥â¥â¥ off And now they ignore every ticket i send in even over a different game.   All and all   Pay to play game Nothing to do with free to play anymore   Support dosent give a damm about the players  Devs Lost theyre passion for the game   BUY THIS DLC TO UNLOCK how about no   Has not changed since i left it   all and all People there are better rpg Games to waste money on   Cheers Junkie
2467	1	a	This game is really fun, if you enjoyed the Grand Theft Auto or Saint's Row series, you'll LOVE this game, it pure multiplayer meaning there is no 'bots' only other players to fight against. Give it a try. It's free!
453	1	a	The anti cheat system is garbage, the developers are terrible and cant keep promises, they are money hungy, its taken them years to do the most simple task AND not to mention they dont really have any live support or anything so if you need help asap i have bad news for you. HOWEVER if you can get over this frustraiton and endless waiting for simple things its a great game, you customise pretty much everything yourself to your own ability, making your own clothes is easy peasy if you have the tallent. id say %50 %50 . you have to kinda be patient with this game... for years
9092	1	a	Great game, Nearly everything i wanted out of a multiplayer Fallout-all its missing the loot what the enemy is wearing and leave thier naked bodies on the side of the road.
3060	1	a	It's a fun game to play with 1 or more friends but alone It's not as fun. Still a great game.
7901	0	a	Rip off of Saints Row. Enough said...
5381	0	a	If I could go back to time I'd save myself from installing this game.
3030	1	a	This is the best game on steam for free there are massive multiplayer and there are on your decision who you are Policeman?? Or gangster if you want game where you driving car in city and killing peopls this is must you chose
5795	0	a	In this games current state, its god awful. It rewards credit card warriors vastly. You can buy the best weapons in the game for next to nothing. And gives new players little to no direction. Just stay away.
7993	0	a	The game wont even start from the launcher 10/10 would never play because it wont even start.
7209	0	a	forced to like on facebook to start game WTF
5134	0	a	It's like cancer for cancer patients
7890	0	a	This game is absolute disaster, it had multiple years to fix it. But it did squat but make p2w weaponry. This game is not worth it, PRERIOD.
9426	1	a	this game is nice when textures are rightt 
67	1	a	Three words... PAY TO WIN.
8162	0	a	Got banned for nothing. â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game
4257	0	a	its like GTA but with a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ier community and â¥â¥â¥â¥ controls
2900	1	a	APB Reloaded is an Open World, GTA-like, cops vs robbers style MMOTPS. You get to rent cars and weapons for 10 days minimum or buy them permanently from their overpriced store with real money; then you get to customise those cars with parts you earn doing missions or if it's bought from the overpriced store. You can also customise your characters extensively, dye clothes, design patterns, use them on your clothes or even on your character as tattoos or just add them to your vehicle. About the gameplay: it's purely PVP, meaning you will be fighting against other players, you will either have a lot of fun or get pissy for being accused of hacking/name calling, but that's a bit normal for PVP isnt it. All that being said, game still has some bugs and an imbalanced system that sometimes favour one side more than the other, not to mention the 'pay4win' thing, the overpriced and overpowered market weapons and such. Despite everything the game is quite fun and the best in its genre.
5481	0	a	Don't bother.
3265	1	a	APB Reloaded is an alright game.. it feels kinda like GTA's â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ cousin. Its biggest problems is pay-2-win and matchmaking. 6/10
3501	1	a	This game has Loads to do! but also has a bland map but makes up with all the stuff you can do :)
3216	1	a	a great game but a bit laggy for me but its a awsome game
9534	1	a	i give it a fish out of blurg  fish/blurg
7727	0	a	Crap, absolute crap. Cars handle like roller skates, story is unimaginative.
4675	0	a	Great customization (characters and vehicles) but it's also pay to win par excellence. You'll get owned by people with 'premium' guns permanently - I guarantee it. If you're not ready to pump money in this game then you maybe should look for an other game. It also seems like there are a hole bunch of cheaters playing, who (as I heard) won't even get banned because they buy stuff for real money. The game itself is really good but thanks to pay to win and the many cheaters it's not enjoyable for more than a month or so. Didn't touch it for years because of this.  Oh btw.: Most time I played back in the day I didn't play it over steam.
5057	0	a	I CANT EVEN play please help me it keeps on telling me to restart the game or redownload it? i really would like to know how to play it wont let me even start it.
1819	1	a	I love this game so much even there's 2many hacker lol but dose shootin like 360 mlg no scope headshot is the best thin I eva done in dis game. some player'z are a camper that camp around store waiting for criminal to Ram the store and get rekt lol. but ani wayz I totally lov dis game sooooooooooooooooooo 1000000000000 ducks / 10 ducks
1528	1	a	This game is amazing!!!
5012	0	a	Hackers, cheaters everywhere, i never play it because it sucks, buy Saints Row and play with COOP for better experience.  Or apply for Triad Wars Beta , bette.r.
2784	1	a	It's best Game...download and play it.  It's Funny xD  E na figata scaricalo e provalo
1484	1	a	1900hrs on my Crim and I still play regularly and have fun setting my own goals, and with the engine upgrade just around the corner and with it the console release I find my self more and more excited for the future of this game.
6057	0	a	This game is such a joke its almost hilarious. Like a gta iv mod of a mod.
9603	0	a	Doesnt let you log in at all Reall confused
3880	0	a	Played for about an hour, after not playing since October 2014.  First mission was a loss - was told to kill myself  Second mission, I was the only person on my team that didn't die - told to kill myself for not defending  Started free-roaming - told to kill myself after killing an infamy 5 and stealing the loot in his van
5256	0	a	No. I rarely write reviews but this was horrible. I'm sure it may have just been me, but this is my opinion. When i launched the game from steam, it came up with a launcher, which is fine, most games have those. they then opened over 15 tabs in my browser telling me to create an account. i did, and then they wouldnt let me mlog in, even when i activated my account. also, This is ver obiously a pay to win game.
7178	0	a	This game is not even loading i said BULLSH*T and start smashing my keybored
5077	0	a	this game is really fun and all but it is a pane in the butt because when you try to run it it going to scew up so no i don't recemend it
3924	0	a	APB... was a great idea and game when it came out but at this point 5/4/2014 this game is competey other â¥â¥â¥â¥, your better off playing some thing else. every thing this game had is gone, any game gamefist takes over turns to â¥â¥â¥â¥. i dont think most ppl will read this but it is NOT worth the download. however it was before gamer fist got it and are milkin it, they do the less work as they can possable to do to keep ppl buging...thats all they do, there has been really NO no content since the game started... 4 or so years later... same game, alot more unstable, alot less ppl...
2924	1	a	Ambitious, that's for sure, with plenty of insane customizability, but overly-high system requirements and unsatisfying gunplay will undoubtedly see this game die. Again.
8897	0	a	In my opinion this game is not worth anyone's time, and here is why: 1. Launcher downloads and installs 200Mb worth of updates for ages.  2. A lot of EULAs which activate every time I launch the game. 3. â¥â¥â¥â¥ graphics and animations. I know the game is old, but for â¥â¥â¥â¥s sake refresh it from time to time. If modders can do it, so can you. 4. Character customization unacceptable. Not enough options to choose from, and existing ones are fugly. 5. Controls are â¥â¥â¥â¥. Movement is jerky, its god damn hard to access stuff around you. there are two screen modes where one is basically there for no reason. Everything could be and was intergrated into a single mode and nobody should have to â¥â¥â¥â¥ing switch it. UI layouts are kind of neat, but god damn hard to access with those camera and mouse modes. Designer should quit alcohol. 6. Can't block in melee, gun recoil is â¥â¥â¥â¥, shooting sounds and effects are â¥â¥â¥â¥. 7. Right after the tutorial game glitched and caused me to fall perpetually. Had to close it by ending Processes in Task Manager.   2/10
1317	1	a	I do reccomend it. It is a great, fun, amazing game with nice graphics and smooth gameplay. But most importantly... It's free!
6190	0	a	Full of with â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t.  So one of my friend told me this game is not pay2win at all,but its not true. So lets talk about 1 gun for now,wich is one of my favorite. The shotgun. So if you compare the JG tactical shotgun with the Colby CSG,they're 2 different weapons.  The colby CSG is almost like a damn sniper shotgun,but the JG tactical cannot do anything like that.  Thanks g1,you just â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up an another game.
9382	0	a	I played this for less than an hour, Then the moderators in the game were total â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ because I 'Wasn't asking questions or talking about the game in chat' instead I was saying things like 'Hey Guys, what's up!' and the moderators gave me a warning because it had nothing to do with the game... So making converation will get you banned..fun. 
6981	0	a	Game given to us from the heavens includes: The game not working correctly Bugs Runs in background AND MANY MORE Game Of The Year 2015 11/10 Would Uninstall Again!
7264	0	a	-Pay2Win (Guns in-game can cost either $30 real dollars or 30hours of gaming (assuming you win most matches)) -Skillcap is just too high for new players (veterans have good gear, better weapons, upgrades, vehices, etc-cannot use certain things if level is too low) -Hackers/Cheaters -Noobs -No engine update
9023	1	a	This game is extremely addicting and fun, the first few hours are boring but once you get past that this game is AMAZING. Graphics are meh and the combat system is kinda bad, however the simple fact that I can go into a cave mine some coal kill giant ants and underdwellers to find a secret cavern is just awesome. And th MMO part adds so much immersion to the game, know whats more fun than attacking a bandit camp? Attacking it with a group of people. I normally stray away from games like this but I have been playing this bad boy nonstop. Also notice how most of the bad reviews complain about difficulty or buggyness or complicated gameplay yet they haven't played for more than 10 hours? They say some crap like this game is Pay2win, and its not at all, Sure paying gets you some 'new' things faster but you can get most of these things ingame anyway. If you are a realism fan then get this game. Note this game has a big learning curve and difficulty spike.  Now to the problems The enemy AI tends to be â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, Enemy's respawn in 1 minute taking away from immersion, for some reason the damage and health system is bad (No joke dogs do 20 Dmg a bite and attack every seconds or so and I've gotton surrounded by em and killed in seconds as the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ take bullets to the head) Stay away from junkyward dogs and gurad dogs is my only tip, The scavenging system can be quite stupid sometimes as well.   Over all this game has +Great gameplay mechanics +Interesting storys and characters +Great immersion +Addictive micro managing +Great trade and communication system  The middle ground Game lacks mercy for new player which can drive people away but not a problem and is more made for intense gamers, not bad but not great graphics.  Now the bad  -Terrible AI -Unhelpful NPC's -Strange level system -Fast enemy respawns  Overall I'd give this game a 8.9/10 
3911	0	a	APB Reloaded seems to be a good idea on paper. What is that idea? Make an online multiplayer game that somewhat seems to be based off of GTA. Does this idea work? I'd say it's a tad mix of both 'yes' and 'no'.  To begin, you can choose from two 'factions' and these are the criminals and the police. The criminals commit crimes and work together to cause as much chaos as possible. These can be as simple as stealing a car and ramming over many pedestrians or working together to rob stores and escape. Eventually, you will cause enough trouble and then you will become a target for the cops (who happen to be controlled by other players). While creating chaos can be fun, I found myself working alone and seeing many other criminal players doing the same thing. I hardly saw two criminals working together during my playtime. Being a target for the cops isn't much fun either as the main goal for the cops seemed to be just finding you and killing you. They don't try to arrest you or anything of the sort; they just chase you and bring you down with bullets. After you die, you just respawn and do it all over again. There are some sort of missions in the game but I wasn't given the slightest clue to where they were. I found a suitcase and was told to deliver it to some location but don't expect the map to get you anywhere as it wasn't much for help.  After derping around with the criminal faction I played the cop faction. Problem is, I found difficulty in even finding my way out of the spawn area and, as stated before, the map isn't much for help. My best guess is that the cop faction patrols the city area and is given a list of target criminals to find and gun down.  Here's a short list of pros and cons that include some points that were not covered: + Vehicles handle differently in an appropiate manner + Graphics look fairly good + Creating chaos is enjoyable + Fair amount of character and vehicle customization + Basic free roaming is entertaining - Map is hard to deal with - Difficult to find missions - Little teamwork - Slight lag issues - Police only shoot down criminals - Community is known to be a little less than friendly  Eventually the confusion and constant deaths bored me and I can't recommend this game to anyone. It'll be nice to uninstall this game to make room for a more deserving one.
5557	0	a	:D i think it's better to don't talk about this game
6549	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ poor with outstanding lag, and a wide open map for you to get gunned downed in by ppl who put considerable amount of money into. If you want a pay to win game this is it, if not then dont bother.
5566	0	a	2 years ago I reviewed this game and said, 'Loading Screen Simulator 2014'  Now, I have a new computer and have recently played the game, like actual gameplay.   This is GTA online for poor people.
2808	1	a	its a pay to win game but play if you want to
7704	0	a	Not fun at all, many players in game are uber powered and all they do is look out for new players to kill over and over,dont recomend

277	1	a	So I decided I was going to get this game. Then I relized that I already owned it. oops.
2673	1	a	APB:R - What can i say? 1: It's the best game i've ever played. 2: It's the worst game i've ever played.  The good:  - First its a fun F2P game.  - Once you get use to the driving in the game cars can be really fun and you and your friends can setup waypoints around the map and race. - The game stops most hacks. Though the game still can't seem to stop some aimbots and macro's. Many cheats in other games on offer are simply not on offer because the servers are hosted by GamersFirst. This means no annoying speed hacks/GodMode/Etc. - No other game can offer you this much customization. You can make your charatcer look like anything you can think of. From 'Ronald Macdonald' to the 'Joker (Batman)' Any of this is possible. You can customize your cars and even make some crazy tattos. - The game unlike Call Of Duty. Requires a lot of teamwork. So i strongly advise grouping up with some friends. You can all work together using different guns so you run up to a enemy with a Shotgun whilst your teammate covers you from a far with a sniper.  The bad: - I have simply never played a game what is so demanding. By far it isn't the best looking game but you can play Battlefield 3 or Skyrim on High FPS but You probably won't be able to play APB at 60FPS without it dropping to 40 or less. - The servers. They suck. Thats all i can say. - Like many F2P there is some P2W in it. If you want to invest a little real money in APB it costs a lot just to get a perm gun for your account ($30+). The guns aren't really P2W. Most of them are just reskins of guns you can unlock in game without paying real money. - This game isn't Noob friendly. Many new players join expecting to play another noob. Well guess what its a either a pro whos created a new account or a decent player who has decided to dethreat so they can stomp on the poor noobs. - They constantly bring new things out. What pretty much always cost you real money.  Conclusion: Get the game its free try it out. When you first get it you probably will get your â¥â¥â¥ kicked all the time. Just chill and carry on playing. When you hit around 50hours playtime you'll be a good driver. Have some cool stuff unlocked and will be winning a few mission =)  Rating 7.5/10 
6295	0	a	If Detroit were a game, this would it.
5294	0	a	OMG, what a TRASH game....  Hackers... Everyone Hacks, Snap to Target, insta kills, it's pathetic.  This game needs to be removed from steam.
2638	1	a	After 1h of gameplay this game ill make u bored =d But atleast its for free!
3103	1	a	Makes grand theft auto look like sesame street
7582	0	a	I've played this game extensively before it came to Steam. If you're looking for a F2P version of GTA, this isn't it. Move along, nothing to see here.  It's not a bad game but it shouldn't be taken seriously. It's rife with hackers, griefers and players who will 'ghost' you during missions. You won't be able to kill them and they can follow you around, distract you, block your objectives, ram your vehicle and tell their allies exactly where you are.  The cash shop in this game is ridiculous. It's like Korean MMO-worthy. One gun can cost you $60 and that's just for a single gun. The monetization doesn't stop there...not on your life and it's incredibly Pay2Win as well.  Now, I know I was just complaining about how the game is full of griefers but to be honest that's really the most fun aspect of the game...doing stuff like taking 4 dumptrucks and blocking off a major highway or parking outside a car garage, leaving a little open space for cars to get through...and when they try to get through...moving in their way as they angrily yell at your immovable dumptruck, causing them to spend more money to re-spawn their vehicle elsewhere.  If you play the game with that kind of attitude, just messing around and having fun...it's not bad. But if you try to play the game seriously, you'll get punked out everytime by either hackers (which run rampant and unchecked) or people who have spent hundreds in the cash shop...or both.
5692	0	a	This was one of the worst 'games' that i have ever played. It took almost two days to download. This is also supposed to be a free to play game, but I had to PAY to make an account. If you don't want want go through this, don't get this.
7699	0	a	Not the best free to play game.
2322	1	a	This game is kind of like a Grand Theft Auto game, exept only online. Not as much freedom as GTA but fun as hell to play with friends
5622	0	a	Do not play this game if you can't tolerate other people's lack of intelligence.. this game is a gathering place for special people.
2006	1	a	When I played the Closed Beta in late 2009, it was a really cool game. But when Realtime Worlds, the makers of the game, went down, Gamersfirst took over the game and made it Free-to-play. It is now a pure pay-to-win game with extreme bonuses that are included in the premium membership etc. It's almost impossible to enjoy the game if you're not a premium user.   But hey, give it a try - it's not a bad game afterall!
10039	1	a	Game is addictive, and community is excelent!
7811	0	a	This game would have been fun but you have to download like 6 things and i still cant play. I cant delete it because it says its running when its not. If they cant fix all this download crap that you have to do and just keep is simple i would think about downloading it again.
6845	0	a	Strike three! The game won't let me even play it.   Okay people make a game that you simply INSTALL and then it PLAYS with no problems.   SO many other game makers do that.    Make a character, choose a name, choose a zone. Then NOTHING. The NEXT button never lights up.   The other times the stupid game said I had another account it was under. Did I sign in with another accout? No.   Looks like it could be cool but I don't have all eon to try and get onto this game. Now how do I delete this and forget it for good.
1049	1	a	Best point and click adventure game ever 10/10
9210	0	a	ugh...
2031	1	a	This game basically ruined my computer, took me 2 days before it started running back to normal I can play this game at a decent graphic setting but this game is laggy, and very P2W.  Edit: Decided to play again and feels like it has improved pretty decently would recommend. Be warned that this game eats up your RAM.
9347	1	a	great game love everything about it...its different and IMO better than your classic style MMO which is well all there is right now. It doesnt hold your hand as much as blockbuster MMO's do. but it does help you along just enough that you wont flounder for to long unaware of what to do next. It has real genuine challenges, no bogus strings or restrictions you wouldnt expect. basically anything you want to do you can do it. it has hardcore elements that are in the player universe but are kept far enough away for the msot part that if you dont want to be a part of it you dont have to be.  only downside I can see is it needs a major overhual fairly soon. graphics and animations need to be redone and brought into 2015. if they did that this game would skyrocket to success no doubt about it
8909	1	a	You like: - complex crafting - open worlds - classless character progression - postapocalyptic setting - manual targeting  You don't expect: - a very colorful cheerful game - a set on rails progression - next-gen graphics  If this fits to what you like, then you will most likely like this game. The crafting is great, the graphics are in some ways not so good (character animations), in some ways average (character models), in some ways really nice (for example having a huge view over the open landscape during a sunset).  It's definately not for everyone, but I enjoyed it a lot and played it a lot. The community is friendly and helpful too. There are a lot of factions, an ongoing storyline, and you often have 'what is behind that hill' moments. And Fallen Earth lets you find out what is behind that hill. There are no invisible walls (except that you can't enter water, of which there is not much to begin with).  I think the game is very relaxing, when you ride over the open landscape and look forward to have your next crafting items finished (crafting can be done while you are offline or doing other stuff), and at times intense, when you are stuck in a cave full of spiders and slowly running out of ammo.
3280	1	a	I recommend this game
464	1	a	Good Game 10/10  -Mugging People -Ram Shop -Good graphic -Cool Weapons -Cool Cars
10610	0	a	fun to play for like 10 minutes     then it gets boring and redundant   if u gonna play play as the priest so y'all can dab in the church
5471	0	a	Change the name to APB: Hackloaded and you're all set.  Expect to loose a lot. Expect to get bsed out of kills. Expect to get aim botted. Expect to never win a mission. Expect a toxic community prob worse than COD players.  Expect to Uninstall this hack infested game. Give you computer a condem before you let it experiance this infested monstrosity.
2034	1	a	good free play game
9134	0	a	I cannot comment on the actual game play because the game doesn't work. It keeps getting stuck on downloading updates and its stuck on a loop. After it downloads the updates, it restarts again and again.
473	1	a	This is a great game to play with friends as the missions require teamwork but the missions can still be enjoyed by a single person. APB is a game that it is easy to mess around with and still earn (in game) money eaisly. For a F2P this game is balanced.
515	1	a	This game is truly amazing, but the only thing I hate is that it's hard to find police when you want to just mess around and not do missions, and you start off with very little (which isn't a problem). But everything else is great from the physics, the atmasphere, and others!
1763	1	a	Nice looking game. Gameplay is intertaining but no enough. Too much pay to win. 5/10
8675	0	a	too much hack
84	1	a	Game that used to be brilliant 2 years ago turned into something many wish it'd never happen. If i would look at the game through prism of the past I'd say it's game that puts MMOTPS genre into the next gen and has a lot of potential that yet has to be revealed... but it was 2 or even 3 years ago. As for today? Don't bother to try this game, servers are running poorly, gameplay mechanics are broken, community is awful and good players have difficulties to get opposed mmission due to matchmaking system yet even with those issues this game has moments when it really is fun. Beside of all these issues this game also has the biggest rage startling factor that i've ever seen in any game before as it's not just about your skill but how good are you at dealing with factors that you don't have control about.
1493	1	a	i wanted to play it for about 7 years im 10 now and im finally going to get it :D and i helped my friend make the hollywood sine really hard took 3 hour's hope u like it U BEST LIKE AND U TOO BEREGHOSTGAMES PLZZZZZZ LIKE IT!!!!!!!!!!!! IM U FRIEND ON ROBLOX JAMESTHEBRAND132 IM LIKE THE 9000000000000 FAN AND SUBSCRIBER ON MY SISTER'S YOUTUBE IT IS BRANDI WOLF 
5217	0	a	This game suxk dix
9338	0	a	Every time I tried to leave the tutorial level, the game would crash.
1241	1	a	the game itself is great and one request from this low-spec and low internet data budget person  -please make server on singapore or filipine or indonesia , so i (or even we) can play with small and more stable ping and make the game fun to all  even though that is the only trouble i have on this game , i still recommend this game to you guys   
1201	1	a	This game is like GTA but with endless custumization i dont recommend getting it on steam because people say its broken on steam it is fairly easy to get it on the web. i do still recocemmend trying the steam APB, mostly because the download from the browser is full of hackers
4379	0	a	Failed to even download...
10781	1	a	fun my expirnce was ruined by my bad keybord but it's fun 
10581	0	a	what happened to the shop?  Use points to buy items and cool stuff... poof now everything costs money but you can still buy a weapon for 50 or lower or something...poof now all that prices costs 51... poof now you start with 40 now you cant buy anything...
4722	0	a	worst game ever remove this steam you only get wepons for 10 days free the rest you have to use real money with you lag like never before u cant play... so yea get it gone
2434	1	a	Not best but could play when bored
5528	0	a	Runs like a horse on downers, upon exiting the game my Steam client still thinks it's running. 10/10
9318	1	a	Still waiting for game to start i have been waiting a while...
8036	0	a	Its a free to play game, it's the same as all the others.
1247	1	a	Amazing game.Amazing replay value.Amazing customization and really strategic game. It's amazing that it rewards players for working in team instead of forcing them to go on their own.
7955	0	a	The customization is awesome! The match making is terrible. I really really wanted to play this. I LOVE THE CUSTOMIZATION! I just can't take getting brutally murdered on every single mission and people telling me how all silvers need to go kill themselves. Playing vs other bronze players the game is fun. You are both new your weapons kind of suck and it's ok. The second you hit silver you will be massacred again and again and expect both your team mates and the other team (they can whisper you to tell you exactly what kind of an a*#hole you are and how your getting 'rekt!nub silver die!*) to berate you constantly. This makes starting out not only frustrating, but no fun at all. I don't want to be a pretty piece of cannon fodder for P2winners, hackers, and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ bags. It's kind of funny that the game's anti cheat thinger is called fair fight when nothing past bronze is even sort of fair. Do I want to spend the time watching myself die over and over again so that maybe I can unlock things that will even the score for a game that might (and probably should) die soon? No thanks. Also the hit detection is godawful. If you think shooting someone in the head should count for as many points as shooting them in the foot? You should ignore my review and play apb.
10676	1	a	Fair game. Very fun to play. It is packed to the brim with microtransactions, but if you become skilled enough at killing and looting in the mountains, there is really no need to buy items from the main hub. It is rather ludicrous that you have to buy character slots and storage that should be immediately available to you. Just greedy, if you ask me.
2347	1	a	Ã¿
3107	1	a	Really fun, more friends you play with the more fun this game can be.
681	1	a	nice pay to win games . fix the lag please
10466	0	a	Free and waste of anyones time
7598	0	a	Although the game is really good it has the most amazing customization on any game ever created you can customise basically anything and the gameplay is okay-ish. Now the bad things about this game: Lagg and i mean ALOT OF LAGG and it seems they don't do alot to fix it it get's even more broken with every patch, 2nd thing P2W if you're unfamilliar it means PAY2WIN basically buy guns and you just do good even if you were born 2 seconds ago and you found out what a mouse is. 3rd Hackers and like lagg its ALOT of them and the worst thing is that the producers of the game don't do anything about it if you payed money for this game, You can just hack away you'll never get banned. Not to mention the in-game community is pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥. But since it is a 'free' game i guess you can download it and try it out and yes you will have some fun with it until you just start raging at hackers or lame vip missions etc.
6948	0	a	this game isnt that good i mean i went on to the enforcer side and people were talking about being horny and being nude in skype calls
4045	0	a	Fun for a while... then it gets horrible. Go play GTA online, its much better.
7675	0	a	Doesn't work for my computer or anything. Sadly i was hoping it would be cool to play.. :(
5186	0	a	Why not to play this game ~ - Pay to win game  - Start versing High ranks and Golds - Scammers  - Getting banned for no reason  - Can get robbed by the game (G1C) - Waste of Time
2526	1	a	Not bad, but it still needs some improvment.The cars handling is not that good, it's like they are on ice.And then when you begin then all the 'pros' kill you beacuse they have better weapons than the beginners.   I would give it a 5/10
452	1	a	Takes a while to get used to if you are new to the play style, but a tonne of fun once you do. However, this is only really a game that you should play with friends, Solo play is possible, but you are likely to get stomped, and just have less fun in general.
6821	0	a	it would be nice if i could actually play the game, when i try to start it, all it says is that the game wasnt properly installed.
3050	1	a	APB. Thats it.
9954	1	a	 Scratches the Post-Apocalyptic Itch
656	1	a	Better than GTA!!!
2519	1	a	Black person sim
1104	1	a	Pretty fun game to pass the time with, but need to play with friends, not a solo game :D
731	1	a	better than most mmo's that i have played
3667	1	a	I was playing this game since release and was following the massive revolution of this game. Awesome game with Rich customization system like: Cars, Clothes, Sounds, Symbols and etc. In another words very awesome Cusomization system. The combo of Shooter game, Cars and Multiplayer IS JUST TOO AWESOME. The good and the bag guys are fighting each other to decide who'll rule San-Paro city... BUT unfortunatly there is a BIG BIG BUT, the game is ruined, as I said, I was following the game revolution from the beggining and I have to say that the more Updates, the more pack they add the game becomes JUST WORSE!!! Meh what's the point... Just in the memory for the good olddays I make good grade but know guys THE GAME IS RUINED, DESTROYED, SMASHED, SUCKS, NON CARE ABOUT IT, FULL OF CHEATERS AND SCAMMERS!!!!!!!
8999	1	a	Its pretty goood See for your self.
2350	1	a	its a good game
3858	0	a	if the developers would put as much time into the actualy gameplay mechanics as they do customization then this game would be one of the best.  poor/ immature comunity third person shooter level 1 newbies need to fight max level players or in other words you can be killed in one hit and you need to shoot others 10 times. bad driving mechanics very little to do  let this game die and take it off steam. i have no interest in this game unless they remove or ratify the above problems
10052	1	a	Fun, little funny. But you know, its an everyday thing to get ate by a mutant chicken right?
4233	0	a	It runs in the background..? I've played for 4 minutes and I've logged 18 hrs.
2187	1	a	It takes a while to get use to but the online is smooth. Im a new player and its ok from the start 8/10.
10302	0	a	don't bother to download, this game is unplayable  i don't know if the server is laggy or the game is glitchy but i can't even hit an enemy in the tutorial mode (the enemy still can hit me), and the animation is so slow. if you have bunch of bandwidth and time to waste, you might want to try it by yourself.
7845	0	a	This game is a brilliant idea but out of my short play time i found this game laggy and annoying all I wanted to do was free roam online then kill other players, when i was playing I was shooting a guy that was online did'nt hurt him what so ever then he shot me and i died its really annoying. So i recomend that if you have a really good computer play this game if not get another.
2491	1	a	It is like GTA but online. I don't pay for money or do missions I just drive around like a â¥â¥â¥â¥. Not bad for relieving stress.
2974	1	a	I remember watching the YouTube trailers for this game back before it's first release. I'm glad to see it's still around.
10198	0	a	Have tried to start the game several times. In the beginning, it would not even let me log in with my Steam ID. Later on, and also now, it starts updating something and quickly gets into an infinite loop trying to update and check data. Still have yet to experience any of this game... (Uninstall works, at least I hope so...)
554	1	a	Awsome cop and robber game! but the best part... make your own tattoes, put them on your body, buy a car, costumize it with your personal style! make your clothes the way you want it! make yourself, make a famous actor/ person you really like! there are really no limit!   PS: you might encounter hackers, atleast I did :( but its still worth it, just for the character costumazations!
5856	0	a	This game no idea what its trying to be
8129	0	a	this â¥â¥â¥â¥ makes brink look like a well made, complete game  'mostly positive'
3238	1	a	Wish there was a neutral recommendation button. This game is a lot better when played with friend, that's for sure. They can help you play the game and it makes the overall experience of that game much more enjoyable. Not exactly new-comer friendly, so be prepared to have your â¥â¥â¥â¥ handed to you. A lot. But, the missions are quite enjoyable, and I found myself enjoying this game quite a bit. I'd recommend playing it if you're curious, but be prepared to get killed when first starting out. Go ahead and give the game a shot!
5637	0	a	An extremely budget free-to-play open world game, immitating Grand Theft Auto across all areas of gameplay and experience. It is also multiplayer only.
2990	1	a	This Game is like GTA You get to Rob stuff Kill people Mug people and other stuff. You can do hold up's and allmost kill everbody. This game contanes Groups Or also known as Factions. If you like GTA get this game.
2262	1	a	great game this is i like better then gta
8953	1	a	Still waiting for that Fallout Online pipedream?? While it may be on its way with a- and lets be honest, long overdue announcement. Fallen Earth is here to scratch away those Post-Apocolyptic itching blues.
3485	1	a	Well, i can say this is really good. The texture, maps, yeah it's all great. Although it doesn't run well on my Acer laptop :)
4121	0	a	Played this game religiously when it was with RTW... played it religiously when it was Reloaded and in CB, all the way until last year.  PROS - #1 They have fixed the game balancing where you can get semi fair matches  #2 As long as you understand the range and effectiveness of your weapon and the enemies... you can get kills... wins however, is another animal  #3 even still to today's standards, graphics aren't bad, and it handles well CONS - #1 LAG SPIKES GALORE  #2 HACKERS GALORE  #3 NOT NOOBY FRIENDLY  #4 BANS ARE APLENTY EVEN TO LEGIT PLAYERS WITH GOD SKILLS... if you show that you are better than 60% of the community, they will ban you quick  #5: COMMUNITY ARE TROLLS!
487	1	a	APB reloaded is a great open world 3D Massively Multiplayer shooter. This game is great and I seriously recommend this game to vetern game players. The game has some negative things like Pay2Win assets that allows rich spoiled people to have everything they desire from a one hit kill assault rifle. To a 1 second reload rocket launcher with a radius of the base of the Pentagon. It also has much trouble with people 'Hacking' as some people call it. However its just a simple means of people downloading Aimbots for it and ruining everyones gaming experience. If this were to be No Pay2Win and you could buy this game for 5 USD. And have a decent ban system and anti 'Hack' system. It would be worth the 5 USD. 9/10 without Aimbotters.
8300	0	a	I bought this game on original release.... why should i pay to play?
9875	0	a	its so bad dont download 
7802	0	a	Quite possibly the most hostile, arrogant and rude player base of any game I have ever played. That alone is enough never to play this game for me.  Besides the player base, the game has very little content. It's all PvP missions and with the low server populations, there aren't that many people that play so the world feels very empty.  Then there are the rampant cheaters with aimbots, etc. The developers are doing their best to combat it, but you can see messages from FairFight banning people every few minutes. That is very telling that there are so many when the server population is maybe 50 people or so.
10176	1	a	To put this game simple here are the pros and cons  Pros -The crafting systm is unique and refreshes your gameplay experince giving you better gameplay  -The game is open world giving you many places to travel -The looting system is common and easy to understand -The enemys in the game are unique from other characters you will see in games -The game is free to play -The game is not pay to win  Cons -The graphics are not the best -The game makes alot of people lag even with a good running system -The game has alot of bugs and when the server has to do maintenence it will take it awhile -The NPC seem dead they dont talk much -The Combat in the game is not the funniest thing you will do -The hud is all over the screen  Overall Graphics-5/10 Gameplay-7/10   So out of 20 i gave it a 12 but if you like free then this is your game

8183	0	a	Dead game, G1 had a golden opportunity to make it a great game when they got it, over the years it has gone to crap. Hackers took over, and they still are trying to get a grip on it. Population is dead, and G1 doesn't listen to the little bit of player base that is left.

Welcome to AidsPointsBulletin one of the worst managed free to play games you've ever seen. Bundled with the worst anti cheat anyone has ever seen in their life and players with brains as equally as smart as dead sperm cells.

8690	0	a	Got banned from the game for no reason. 10/10 Would make new account.
8406	0	a	A once promising game developed into a steaming pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥ by yet another company that has no idea what its doing with its product. Seems to be a pretty common theme these days, hence why I consider this the MMO dark ages. Simply no good games to play, just a bunch of could have been decent games that have already been run into the ground by incompetent developers and greedy companies.
2178	1	a	I used to play and I was good, now I dont play and I am â¥â¥â¥â¥. Only play this game if you are going to be consistantly playing it.
10922	1	a	its good game 
1725	1	a	this freaking game won`t work on my computer 
8515	0	a	When this game was first released in stores and offered all content available to it's users, I heard nothing but great things about the game. Only downside was a smaller playerbase since many people simply have backed away from monthly payments for MMOs in the modern age of F2P (Free 2 Pay) games.  So eventually the game went F2P and moved onto Steam where I myself started playing it. Now it had a few bumpy issues such as having %30-%50 of the customization content blocked behind paywalls. But this was to be expected of a F2P game anyways.  Then the game slowly started changing...getting...corrupted...everything started costing money...the fun started to disappear as content was getting added slower...and slower...until the game was no longer the fun and customizable world that it promised to it's players. Now it is but a shell of itself, whispering...'pay me...paaaaay...meeee' in your ear at every opportunity.  10/10 wouldn't play again...
159	1	a	Quite fun, but really hard pay-to-win game, so it destroys alot of play joy. Still fun to play though
4931	0	a	whats the point... GTA Online

8959	1	a	Fallen Earth Pros:  -Amazing environment and immersion -Wonderful PvP gameplay -A rediculously good crafting system -A large ready-to-explore map to quench your need for adventure -55 levels with new gear no matter what you're at -Conveniantly placed merchants and fairly easy-to-master Fast Travel system for teleporting all over the map at low cost Auction prices that players post are generally fair*  Fallen Earth Cons: -The majority of the staff team needs work or improvement as far as moderation and fairness goes (this is prone to change whenever they may so improve) -The community is easy to get sucked into, and not in a good way, people tend to troll endlessly if you get them going, and they can go on for hours and never shut up due to mass amounts of self-pride and ignorance -Everyone types with their face -The Auction can sometimes become inflated but over-all it's fair*  Do I reccomend it? Yes! This game is unlike any other, and you can't say Fallout beats it because last I checked Fallout didn't have the balls to be an MMO! Let alone FREE TO PLAY YOUR WAY!
1721	1	a	A great Third-Person Shooter that allows for full character, car, symbol, and theme customization. That's basically the only positive aspect of APBR.  Negative aspects include a multitude of hackers and exploiters which cause for people to rage easily. The game also includes trolls which like to drive dump truck into your vehicles. Open world districts allow people not a part of your current mission to grief you with what's called 'Ghosting'.  The game is full of bannable offenses but the company, GamersFirst, does nothing about it since their ban policy is based on user input. Users need to record and report a user for a person to be banned.  If you have a weak control of emotions then I would suggest not playing this game.
5882	0	a	I actually really wanted to play this game when i figured out what it was kinda like gta the mmo till a downloaded it was so hard to set it up and when i did, it didn't even load then i started to find this game a peice of cow â¥â¥â¥â¥ don't get this game

7458	0	a	It's bad. Just that.
1289	1	a	Can't even register an account.   Best uninstaller simulator, 11/10 Would uninstall again!
10667	1	a	Just hours and hours of game play, so many things to do..... i cant stop playing it
4156	0	a	APB has got to be the worst free to play game out there! it doesn't use any antihacking programs and most of it's players have a bad attitude! It's a pay to win game, wich means they ripoff their players because they don't stop the hackers, wich means people who pay for ingame guns to be better really arent because there are hackers everywhere! When you join a mission you will either get kicked from it by the leader coz of your low rank or your team mates will kill you to annoy you, then when you get enemies they will kick you. it's a horrible game to play, it only causes stress! 0/10 from me, i uninstalled it because i hate the attitude of its players. (Games are suposed do be fun and enjoyable).
6789	0	a	It's a game that you play a whole lot for a weekend then never go back to it.
7090	0	a	Plagued by an awful dev, horrid community, and no resemblance of a fair match making system, this is a game that is aimed to appeal to whales and grade A try-hards. There is no in between.  I finially quit today after giving it an honest effort. My performance was not bad, but i can draw no joy from this toxic community. Too many missions lost because the entire team has grenade launchers but no one they're fighting is even half way done progressing towards them. Too many high skill rating players in low skill districts. Too many max rank players farming noobs. Its disgusting, and G1 does nothing to stop it.
2522	1	a	Alright, I'll say it right off, if you want something to just pick up and play and be great at it, this is not for you. It takes practice. Skill can overcome almost anything in this game (Except the serious problem with hackers) If you invest money in it, it can be fantastic, though I have not yet spent a dime on it. Going into this game remember to keep a cool head and communicate with your team, also remember it is a GAME meaning it is here to have fun. So have fun. I personally consider it a canvas. The customization in this game is addictive and delicious. It takes a serious grind to get everything, and I doubt I'll ever make it, but being able to customize to this degree, I think it's well worth while. Plus, who doesn't like killing cops while blasting Hollywood Undead out of your car speakers? Or blasting Five Finger Death Punch's 'Mama's said knock you out' while mopping the floors with some criminals? Either way, the customization is there, and if you like games but never feel like you play as yourself, or the character you want to be, or maybe you're just settling or picking a favorite, in any case, if you want to express yourself, this is for you. If you're reading this recently after I posted you can see my steam profile pic is indeed a modified screenshot from the game. Start it up, guys, be patient and try your best.
5236	0	a	It's just impossible there are cheaters and it's as buggy as heck.  but the uninstall button worked!
7431	0	a	i hate this game
5009	0	a	As fun as the multiplayer is, if you have computer with anybit less than minimum, you will have nightmares of lag and latency. this game is far more taxing to a computer than anyone would expect.
6693	0	a	Not really good, the game just throws you in with no explanation of what to do. Everyone is running around with p2w weapons which can one shot you, your start weapons are absolute useless shot my whole magazine in guy and he didnt even flinch.Also the grenade spam is preposterous everytime you come near a objective you are greeted by thousands of grenades... Loading times are waaay too long which is strange considering that the graphic arent that great. All in all I didnt had a good time also the community are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s.
4124	0	a	p2w with unfair matchmaking constant crashing on six core cpu and aim cheaters
1152	1	a	Downloaded game, entered the city, got into a mission, I rekt a guy, guy accused me of hacker.   10/10 would Rekt him again.
2113	1	a	dis game iz really guud
3634	1	a	Love it 
492	1	a	it em good wif frenz 
1238	1	a	This game can get you raged as all hell, and yet once your hooked you'll keep coming back..  If you find the good side of the community, make a few friends, and get built up a little bit you'll love it.
6531	0	a	The game altogether is good but they need to put in stamina and jumps should use it, because all the enforcers do is jump and sprint side to side so you cant hit them. And another reason you cant hit them is horribly broken hit box. Then when they are in range they just tase you then handcuff you. Then when they taser is recharcing or somthing they jump around and shoot like a mad man while you are trying to keep it realistic and you pump 20 shells in to there No good-low lying-bottom feeding-dirt eating-crap sandwichs, they pump 2 shells into you with an OP gun and kill you. And everyone either does this or snipes. Thats what you get with this Crap-sandwich with no bread game!
830	1	a	Anyone else remember the time when you could put images on certain billboards? Yeah, Hentai, HENTAI EVERYWHERE!
548	1	a	This is one of my favorite games i know its pay 2 win but you can still have fun with friends making clothes, and symbols and you can do really many things like you can do in grand theft auto 5 but you got too have a pretty good pc
3818	0	a	Torturously close to being good. Can be played and sometimes enjoyed if you accept that it will never improve. Unfortunately has never been imitated by another game, so there is little motivation for improvement.
10666	1	a	I can make a new review for this game, considering the new owner/host of the game: Deca Games.  They took charge and started working on the game again.   Here's what they've done so far:  1. Spam bots are completely gone, and some of the multi-boxers and hackers are gone. 2. Brought back life into the game by bringing the community together for a big celebration of Month of the Mad God. 3. Gave out free rewards to those active in the community. With Events and such.  Pros:  1. Very rewarding, Challenging dungeons give the better loot. 2. Good community on reddit and mostly in-game too. 3. A Star ranking system based off how many class challenges you've completed by hard earned, long lived characters. 4. DEATHLY addictive. (sorry)  Cons: 1. P2W, buying (gold) will allow you to get some of the best gear. 2. Difficult, hard to get used to dieing. (Even thought its part of the game) 3. Until recently, the game had a bad owner, Game is recovering.  I recommend this game, 7.9/10 :^)
1671	1	a	APB is a large scale free-roam third person free to play shooter. Especially fun with friends. The Game takes place in San Paro, a city ravaged with crime. there are two sides enforcer and criminals. The customazation is deep on all levels. You are able to go on missions and battle against the enemy organization for a objective.

10489	1	a	Good game play. Need to improve on stash and inventory.
3840	0	a	Played original APB under RTW, loved it.  Played APB:R under G1, loved it, for a while.  Pros: Fun game play Fun customisation Can do stupid things like jump a car to the moon Fairfight catches most cheaters Varied Mission objective locations   Cons: Removed the cops and robbers themed missions, now its just 2 teams of gang bangers Rented guns - because who dosen't like to come back to a game after a short break to find out all your stuff has expired? Griefing, by open world players... alot... Punkbuster - Possibly the most overzealous anti-cheat ever made. Poor car handling all except a handful of cars ar elike driving on ice. Armas - Want that cool gun that you saw in a film/game? sure you can have it for the low low price of another AAA game on release day. Random weapon nerfs for existing weapons - Remember the old 5 shot kill FBW that existed for 2 years? not anymore. Joker boxes - because gambling at the tracks is bad but its ok in a game. Broken Armas weapons on release - Whisper? OCA-Nano? Trouble maker anyone? Lag - This happens alot. Poor optimisation - yeah the game dosent run smoothly and will fps spike even on a GTX980ti. Low population - chances are you are going to get your â¥â¥â¥ handed to you consecutively by the same teams over and over agian. Toxic community - if you beat someone you are a hacker, if you lose then you are garbage scrub. Engine update Soonâ¢ - This was announced back in 2014 I think? Sqeakers - 70% of the people that play this game haven't even hit puberty yet despite the M mature rating.  *Devs constantly try to hold you back by preventing skill based/intelligent play*  Scout rifle jump shot - gone, QS3 sniper quick switch - nerfed, shotgun consistent damage cone (from 2 years back) - nerfed,  CQB joker carbine - nerfed: Ghost shot every other shot,  strafing run oscar - nerfed: Ghost shot every other shot, Utility sniper DMR - nerfed and split into 2 different guns,  tommygun with muzzle brake - nerfed Conc thats that 1 shot on a perfect prime and direct impact - nerfed ntec that used to be accurate up to 70m out - nerfed STAR that used to be worth a damn in CQB - nerfed Cobra rifle - this was never relevant to begin with despite the hefty $30 price tag ATAC - was good on release but nerfed very shortly after PMG with Ex mag3 - nerfed,  Mid air rocket launcher artillery - 2 second charge up timer nerf. Pig stungun + Perc nade - still broken. This list goes on...
4743	0	a	i accidentally left this game open while sleeping
6714	0	a	Awful game. A lot of glitches to exploit and matchmaking is just awful. Let's not forget the game breaks almost every time you start up so you have to repair it constantly. When I first started playing the game I thought it was pretty good, but the glitch exploits like standing on a moving car and shooting rockets so you don't have a chance protecting the vip started getting old. Also people not in the misson ram and flip you so the people on the other team can kill you.

2229	1	a	A simple fun game best played with friends,graphics are good,despite not being top notch,gameplay is relatevly smooth,a big playerbase,wich most of the time cheats or is premium or both,it can sometimes make you nervous to death,but if you look for a game where you can play with freinds and laugh at the bugs and all kinds of over the top missions,you'll like the game.Don't buy anything with real money,though,heard that the game has terrible customer support.
912	1	a	I love this game but it's pay to win. I understand that the creators have to get an income sometime, but they could atleast in the future make it pay to play instead of pay to win or do a give away for the holaday's and give everyone who does some challanges a gun or a car kit or something like that.
9724	1	a	a nice fun game kind of like fallout 7/10
7119	0	a	This game is a total â¥â¥â¥â¥! After playing almost 200 hours + 100 before merging on Steam on my old account, i can easily say that this game is the worst Sandbox-MMO EVER! I've spent almost 100 bucks on it. Yeah, 100 BUCKS! This game is total PAY TO WIN, if you're not paying, you cant win. Also, cars, skins, guns are for real money too! And the community is the most toxic i've ever met! Seriously, even CS GO community is less toxicated that this piece of garbage! Also the optimalization of the game leaves A LOT to wish, if you're having 50 fps you are in the top 100 PC rank propably.  So, the game is a total â¥â¥â¥â¥ that costs nothing to download and to rage over it besides nerves, but it costs a lot to really play it. Who the hell thought about doing P2W system in APB? Oh, yes, the studio whose said that they are going to make the game alive. I see. DO NOT DOWNLOAD, PLAY OR BUY ANYTHING FROM THEIR WORKSHOP EVER!
7175	0	a	I can't even play it -.-, Can someone help?

8559	0	a	I can't tell if I like this game or not because I seriously can't tell if I'm playing the game right or not. I've never played something that's kept me utterly confused six months after playing it.
36	1	a	No matter what team you choose, you will get your â¥â¥â¥ kicked unless you have a lot of luck.  This is one of those games where it's a LOT more fun with friends, without them all you have is trying to make friends, missions, etc etc.   Another thing you hear a lot about. Hackers. Lots of them. Or just really good players.  Overall:  Melon/10
6970	0	a	this game is like no other game thats i have ever seen befor this game has so many hackers so many glitches and so much profanity its a shame to call that a video game i was very interested in the game and was very very up set i couldnt progress because its such a mess in that game and i hope any parent that sees this game does not buy it for there child this game need to be banned. this is y people are being bullied and pushed around this game is garbage.   p.s. SUCH A SHAME
9262	0	a	This game is full of minor but very irritating bugs (especially the UI), none of which have been fixed since I tried it three years ago. I strongly suspect that the owners (who, I believe, are not the original developers) are in 'Maintenance Mode', milking the game until players tire of it, but not adding any improvements or fixing any but the most serious of issues. Just on this basis alone, it is hard to justify sinking any money into it, which means you will be stuck with the sub-standard F2P experience.  Even if the bugs were fixed, though, the game utterly fails at narration: none of the characters are memorable. The missions, though ostensibly varied by their flavor text, ultimately feel very samey. How many times was I told to 'defend your location'? In one of the last missions I did, I had to go deep, deep into a prison to kill a boss. It was hard to find him, and at one point I had to traverse a corridor almost literally packed with enemies, who stood there blankly while I murdered their comrades 4 meters in front of them. I finally got to the boss, the culmination of all the mission stories in the zone. There was no dialogue or confrontation; he just attacked me, and what ensured was a long, long fight (due to his massive amount of health) where I tried to cut him to pieces with my knives, while he shot me in the face with a pistol. It's too bad, because his story was kind of interesting. (He was cloning himself, and apparently one of his clones decided to lead the resistance against him.)  Combat is tedious, and (for my melee build) mostly consisted of holding down both mouse buttons while aiming the reticule at an enemy. This is made difficult mostly by the camera, enemies' poor pathfinding -- which frequently causes them to run around unnaturally before they home in on you -- and the facts that the game occasionally ignores your keystrokes and gives little or late feedback when it does detect your keystrokes.  There are good things about this game -- otherwise I wouldn't have spent as much time with it as I did -- but I'm not motivated to list them here, because mostly what I feel about it now is frustration.
2963	1	a	It's alright...I get to many flashbacks.
5516	0	a	Dont ever ever play this game it is made only for ppl who pay money,if u just want to get it for free and play it u will get dominated and killed then killed,killed.....

225	1	a	Very nice game ;D
1052	1	a	You all have got to try out this game if you haven't yet. It is Awesome!
1712	1	a	Awesome game +1 i recommend.
4848	0	a	Game always freeze and also you need to be an admin account to start the launcher. Please fix this. I'll be happy if this will be fixed in the future.
1051	1	a	APB is a very fun to play game, you don't need to pay for anything to have loads of fun. Some features of the game include Cops and Robbers, Ram Raiding (by far the best), and freeroam. There is DLC to buy but i don't use it mainly because i don't want to buy it. This is my opinion of the game, and i hope you like it. Enjoy those RamRaids!!!
5158	0	a	it was so bad, i couldnt even get on the game the 16 minutes ive played was on the installing screen and then when i wanted to exit the game i couldnt even exit it i had to force close steam or restart my computer

8951	1	a	Alright. This may as well be a rant but I'm going to break this review down on some subcategories. I've been playing this game for a while and recommend it to new people. HOWEVER, for people playing the Alpha and Beta like I had, GOOD LUCK GETTING YOUR CHARACTER BACK. G1 basically said 'screw you' to me and I haven't even been able to access my character from maybe...3-6 months ago? Not even? TERRIBLE. 
7518	0	a	I wish it was good, but it isn't. Cash shop driven, not enough content, cheaters EVERYWHERE. The theory is good, execution bad, and this will never change as developer is underpowered to fix it.
3401	1	a	  i like the game but honestly the community sucks as i free player its not possible to get past silver since all gold players are premium and have paid perks and weapons. but as a silver player or below you can have a good time with the game
5266	0	a	Broken matchmaking, pay2win, hitboxes are joke, missions are grindfest, no actual freedom to do anything else besides just drive around.
7484	0	a	This game is unique and addictive. It's like GTA, just that it has smaller maps. The gameplay is a lot batter and the customization is epic. Back when it came out i would recommend this game, but not anymore. I am not saying that all the things GamersFirst did were bad, but a lot of them were. Now let's go to the sad part. It has unbalanced missions and weapons, bad spawns, matchmaking, community and it contains lot's of bugs, that are not getting fixed. Marketplace is too expensive, the servers are unstable and are sometimes being ddosed. When that happens the ms jumps over 150, makes it unplayable. They are not adding any new stuff to the game that they promised long ago (like new contacts, free content) nor are they listening to community wishes. The engine upgrade has been in making for eva and they keep postponing the date of its release!  The game has been in a really bad shape for a long time and considering what have we the community seen so far, there is no chance it will get any better anytime soon, maybe never who knows....
9618	1	a	Very fun mmo!! fun fallout feel. would reccomend this to anyone that has 3000 hours to spare :)
2227	1	a	Amazing customization GTA like gameplay online anarchy i love this game!
9368	1	a	One of the best free to play post-apoc mmo I have played. It has everything from crafting to killing and well everything else you love in a wasteland game...even zombies but thats a given.
5532	0	a	Another p2w, pile of trash, only this time, its the revival of the fastest mmo to ever be shut down. Thats always a beacon of confidence.
519	1	a	the game is cool
968	1	a	my playtime consists entirely of updating
4321	0	a	When developers make a game free-to-play, the goal is to make it fun and fair for people who dont want to pay, but allow for bonuses for when you DO PAY. This game is STRICTLY pay to win. Impossible to do anything at all from the very start as a free to play player.  EDIT: You get completely destroyed by all the other geared up players as a beginner, and the game offers nothing to give you even the slightest bit of an edge in combat until payed for.
5541	0	a	I have been to funerals more fun than this
9048	1	a	Meh okay repedative but overall fun
4660	0	a	This is the definition of Pay 2 Win.
3676	1	a	Love it man just need a good net and a pc but i love this game since gta 5 hasnt released for pc its like a replacement :D
10654	1	a	it's a fun mmo with a fairly good trading system and fun game play. There is perma death but you can avoid by drinkin stat poitions from enemy drops or trade up for better loot.

9278	0	a	After keeping me busy for over 700 hours and becoming a part of my daily routine, I started becoming leader (quite often) of the Citidel town defence. Went great until I found that I was wasting my time getting nowhere and I don`t want to pay to win in PvP and decided that life was too short.  Figured out that someone willing to pay could have done it all in about 20 hours or someone willing to pay for hacks.   10/10 pay to win or grind simulator
879	1	a	very nice game 
9853	1	a	I like this game, it's very easy to play.
4375	0	a	I have about 12 hours of playtime of it on my account. They're all wasted on trying to start the game. Best game 1889
8725	0	a	I used to recomend this game, but after 6+ years of playing it there has been so little change that i can longer recomend it. Maybe after the fabled engine update comes out (whenver the hell that'll be) that might change. But with the ownership of the game currently under the money milking copany G1, nothing will happen. There hasn't been any change in 6+ years, the haker problem is getting worse, half the weapons are unbalanced, and there are many more issues that make this game hard to enjoy, even with all of the potential it had

10512	0	a	It's pay to win. If you put real money into a character and it dies, you lose everything, due to perma-death.
2489	1	a	The best game I've probably ever played, and one that consumes all my time. A new kind of MMOTPS. It's a GTA like game where good guys (Enforcers) fight to keep the streets clean from the bad guys (Crims). So choose your side, and go be all you can't be!
10635	1	a	Me and my friends thaught we would play this once for 2 minutes but this game is the â¥â¥â¥â¥
5396	0	a	It is a pile of wank........ Stop buying in-game guns if you have already and use the money to buy a p*rnhub subscription, Becuase if you have wasted money on in-game guns those are probably the only t*ts you will see for a long while
2357	1	a	This is â¥â¥â¥â¥
7377	0	a	Not only did I have trouble getting the game to open, when it did I was presented with a credits screen and then a black screen that persisted for over five minutes. I couldn't alt-tab out of it, my task manager wouldn't open from it, and it wouldn't close via right-click on the task bar so I had to reboot my computer. Immediately uninstalling this defunk software.
7982	0	a	I tried and tried to play this game but never the less it would never play. I downloaded it, waited 20 minutes for it to update hit the start button and nothing. It just turned off. I tried again another three times. still nothing' I then uninstalled and reinstalled everything and tried another few times and once again NOTHING WORKED!! So im fed up and annoyed and completely deleted it off my computer... This looks like a really fun game but when you just wont work i cant exactly tell you what is good and whats not..  
1078	1	a	This game is Heaven for all PvP'ers and MMO players
33	1	a	Brilliant idea.... The game looks amazing, little unbalanced at some points, but it's still kinda amazing... graphics is very good for a f2p type and the gameplay too. Everything customizable from characters, clothes to cars. Nice team based actions.. It would be way better If most of the ppl are not kids and also there is some annoying cheaters, but the game is good.. Recommended to only Hardcore/pro players. 8/10
4031	0	a	Gotta love it when the game's first mission is to go up against people who have RPG's, sniper rifles, and LMGs.........just don't waste your time.
4491	0	a	i played to mutch of this game and i started to hate it after i found out that it was not that i sucked it was the shooting system the game has no head shots or weak points. that showed the reality for pay to win the more you pay for guns with real money the better you are in combat. it's impossible to get good guns for free. and if you get something remotely close to good you are limited to few weeks to own it. you can get free guns that last forever but to get one gun you need to play this for more than 40h and they will still suck (obs. if you see someone with fancy car or cool clothing that you need to fight, you better run). then we are done with guns, now we can go to customization the main thing that the game rubs in your face. Yea it's good but for non members you are limited to specific number of layers on eatch object. the music maker system is pointles couse most music that you can find from community is copies of edm and the samples you get to use sounds like form sega genesis (michael jackson's moon walker Was better than this). the cars just looks like chinese knock off of american and japanese cars. only the little plus isbattle arena wich is bit addictive but will make you angry after finding out the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ wepon system i can't give a good score to this game couse of bad shooting system, good but limited customsation, pay to win system and badly made car models. i give 2/10 (better to download gta sa. with online mod or get gta 5)
10423	1	a	Good apocalyptic feel hunter gatherer exploring crafting and stuff, good times. combat is easy and good. haha. Simple stories but nice. Relaxing rides on my hourse I call Tumble Weed. No presure to buy anything and no need for it. Only buy something like some extra goodies like an outfit etc... if you want to support the game. And it runs nice no problems here.

2409	1	a	This game i really cool but always the same thing happening everyday i play it's the same missions and not much to do but walk around and wait for a mission to come (would probs be the same mission you just did) but if ur really into art and love to create and costomsize the game has alot to offer with that i go through dissusions and see very cool emblems and character's or if u love killing idc c:.... i like it doe
6175	0	a	This game is too old need upgrade charaters,graphics and cars XD
3800	0	a	Hey everyone,  first of all, don't mind how many hours Steam shows I have played because it is wrong. I played this game at least 300+ hours and have a 178 ranked character.  Now, I have started playing this game a few years ago and I have always had troubles with it.  It is a game you really want to love but you can't and I will tell you now why.   THE GOOD    + Character creation and customization  The game has an amazing character creation and plenty of customization options that I have yet to seen a better version in similar games.   + Cars  There are enough number of cars to keep the variety and they can be customized as well.   + Customization and personification  The game both in its character creation and car customization offers enough tools to create your own unique look in the game.   THE BAD    - Lack of new content  Since the time I started playing this game, it hasn't changed much at all.  It has basically only a few game modes that have stayed the way they are for a very very long time.   - The story  The game does have a story at the beginning but it is non-existant through out the rest of the game. Of course you can't expect a rich story from this kind of a game but since it doesn't have much else to offer, it could be nice to at least have a story.   - Server issues and lag  The game has been and still is barely playable with its sever issues and constant lags. It has suffered from these problems for a long period of time and unfortunately it doesn't get any better. This makes especially driving a horrible experience since they are server based.   - Premium membership and cash shop  The game suffers from unbalanced premium weapons which are overpowered compared to in-game weapons.   - Graphics   The graphics are not too bad and could be overlooked if the game had a solid gameplay and at its current state they look dated.   CONCLUSION   The game has a lot of potential but unfortunately it doesn't do muchto explore the possibilities both in its gameplay and story. Apart from having an excellent character creation and customization, the game unfortunately doesn't have very much to offer with its repetitive gameplay.
7108	0	a	Don't even try this sh*t. I gave this game a lot of chances, but doesn't worth a second lossed on this game. Don't loss your time for this kind of sh*t. Belive me, you will regret it for a lifetime.   I will share few things I saw in this game, that will brings your so much nervous and also will 'push you away' from this game: â¢ The 'anti-cheat' system it's crap. Doesn't do anything at all.  â¢ Matchmaking balance in this game it's 'amazing' too. Or, I better said, there is no balance in the game. â¢ This game should be renamed to: Pay 2 Win: Reloaded. (simple as that) â¢ Engine of this game it's crap. Full of bugs. Everything looks stupid on this game, even you are playing on high perf PC, you will have lag, frozing, dropping fps, etc. The buildings looks like cardboard box from some low-budget cartoon. â¢ Lot of unnecessary and unclear informations on the screen and everywhere in the APB World. â¢ The red-cross hit symbol means that you hit the target...NOPE, that means you hit everything in front of your target, but not him.  Recommendation: Don't try this game ever! That's why they made this game free. Better collect money and buy GTA V. It worth buying and playing that game online.
1144	1	a	Extremely underrated game!  Pros: Extreme customisation system Gameplay simmilar to that of Grand Theft Auto V Good enough graphics  Cons: MICROTRANSACTIONS.
6511	0	a	That lady's pants are about to fall off.
9164	1	a	its a good game just needs some minor tuning
7637	0	a	This game would be one of the best games out there and one of the most fun games you could possible play with friends. However. It is not. Simply because it is so much pay-to-win from the moment you enter that it becomes a matter of who has the more money. missions are fought against other players and since the game is so pay-to-win It is impossible to properly play for a person who can not buy weapons from the real-money stores. Weapons that includes a sniper which you can jump with and thus be rather agile. One shot to the head with that thing and you are pretty much dead.  It is a very fun game but Pay-to-Win kills it shortly after you start. Sure its possible that you come up against people who does not have these kinds of weapons. But most of the time you will have to deal with Pay-to-Win people as soon as you hit gold ranks  Unless you want to pay for weapons that are overpowered compared to what non-paying players can get. I'd suggest you pass on this game. That is my opinion.
5684	0	a	This is a good game but sadly poorly executed first off the cars handle HORRIBLEY youll be slipping and sliding everywhere also the guns you start out with are crap you will ALWAYS find your self out gunned against other players and the pay isnt good either my vederict is just buy gta 5 that game is good and much better than this
10705	1	a	DIS IS A GAME WHERE A MONSTER ATTACKED AND EVERYONE DIED

7816	0	a	if you are from egypt dont download this game because there is no world is near t you so you cannot play you will just be able to custom a characters
2429	1	a	APB Reloaded is a game with a classic setting - cops versus crooks. It is a very fast paced open world shooter. The game is very simple and fairly easy to learn, but like most things, hard to master. When you enter the game you create your charater. You have a lot of customization options. A lot. After that, you will expirience a lot of wierd moments, where you will not know what you are doing. But when you actually grasp the game logic, you will start to have a lot of fun, but again, it does tend to 'punish' those who lose missions. But, the gameplay isn't even close to why the game is so much fun. When you enter the social district, you get to costumize your charater at various kiosks around the map. You can costumize all from your charater, to their clothes and even their car. But then again, you do need to buy premium for further costumization (Premium costs around 15â¬). When you feel you know your way around the game, you will want to join a clan. Clans in this game don't add much meaning to the game, other than the name, and possibly a clan event here and there. But it is an amazing way to meet new people, to play with. Some clans even tend to have clan colours or even clan clothing. The game does lack weapon balancing (the armas gold weapons are a lot of times a lot better when being hold by a - so called pro) and it does (at times) have a big number of aimbot and wallhack hackers, which ruin the mood. The game servers aren't the best and you do need a good system to play it without fps lags. Also, the people in the game are a lot of times â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s and can ruin your mood. Don't let them! The game is a lot of fun once you know what you are doing and the costumization is amazing - one of the best in mmo games. Overall, it is worth a shot.
1785	1	a	Awful game. Not enough ntec reskins.
4781	0	a	Well that was 3.7 hours I'm never getting back.  APB, apparantly, was once a brilliant open-world game with players joining the ranks of either the police force or the criminal thugs as they battle it out in gamemodes and on the streets. However, it went horribly wrong at some point and now we are left with this mess.  APB was and still is an open world shooter with missions, ranks and unlocks, and granted, I enjoyed my first hour or so customising my thug to be what I liked to call 'Bootleg Batman'. I had read the reviews saying that its horrible and its 'A good game gone bad', but I was willing to give it a go.  My first hour went something like this, I opened the game and was greeted with a character customisation screen. I've always been a sucker for customisation options so I was eager to get started. When I did eventually finish I got into the game, did the tutorial (there wasn't much of one anyway) and drove my car around. I began looting shops for the next hour and then I decided it was a good idea to do a mission. How wrong I was.  The mission went horribly. The people against us had overpowered rifles and rocket launchers, and they just ploughed through our cars like they were made of tinfoil. After this, I came to the conclusion that it was just a fluke, an unlucky game. I tried a few more, it was the same thing. I did this about 10 times before giving up entirely.  My point is, is that there is no balance system, so noobs and general idiots don't get cut any slack. Not to mention the disgustingly cancerous community. I'm pretty sure I became a tumour after I was finished with this game, it was either Russian fetuses shouting â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ or some idiot blaming everyone but himself for not winning, and don't even get me started on the open world trolls. You cant even walk 6 feet without getting your brains splattered all over the badly textured walls by some sniper that's half way across the small 'open world' map.  To finish off, don't get this, don't think of it, don't even think of thinking of it, otherwise you will get tumours. Either that or you'll play long enough to become the tumours.  tl:Dr here:  Pros:   Customisation system, and a good one too, its fleshed out and you can customise all of your car and your clothing  Cons:   No balancing system, low levels get the benefit of losing their faces to high level sniper rifles repeatedly  The cars handle horribly, its like I driving on ice  The textures are terrible  Cancerous community, take your pick from Russian fetuses, 6 year old idiots and human swear machines  Trolls (also cancerous, but deserves its own listing), snipers camp the  rooftops rocket launcher guys stalk the ground, and smell the fresh noob meat.  Grindfest, takes a week to get anything of value.     Just, don't bother with this.
206	1	a	this game is great but when i start it half of the buildings dont load so its like an invisible maze 
7024	0	a	Not alot to do, being the cop has less things to do than the criminal but the criminal still has hardly anything. it gets repetitive its just take deliver take deliver, you can shop but thats about it erm...the events are the same mug some people kill some boss and deliver what you stole from the person you mugged.theres mailboxes to recive things but it's not that good theres chop shops and tiny missions that are all the same.  overall rating:4/10 it's okay to play every know and then but only for like 5-10 mins because it's repetetive and boring just like my complaint!!  
9587	1	a	This game is a preety good game it has been a while since the last time i played it but it was a really good game but it takes a while of getting uset to, But dont expect to fall in love with the game right away you have to give the game a chance. 
1058	1	a	It is so so.
2728	1	a	From a totally honest standpoint, I had my objections when I downloaded this game, I thought 'Will this be a pay2win?, Will there be uneven player matches, Will there be hard quests and laggy servers?' Well of course. being the APB is a one of a kind MMO, it's bound to have so many negative features, but what game out there doesn't?  APB Reloaded is an action packed third-person POV game that makes you really on strategy, teamwork, and gear, and although there is a pay2win aspect, you don't need to buy gear just to be a great player. The missions do get repetitive, and it seems like the characters all give you similar quests, which is a downside, but the multiplayer integration goes along well, and most matches have several parts facing you off with opposing forces.  The game is glitchy, to be expected, but it isn't terrible. There is not much lag, and the ragdoll physics are a personal favorite of mine. One thing I do have to say that bugs me is if your car is going about 70 mph or 5000 km/h and you eject, the game gives no â¥â¥â¥â¥s and you get out unphased. Please fix  Overall, it's a quite smooth, relaxing game, that's really good to play with friends. A big tip to getting famouse would be to make and sell whatever products you make. Always take requests and form alliences at the social districts, or in missions. And lastly, just have fun. Don't let what people tell you to persuade you to not pick up this game, it's a good waste of a few gigs. So see for yourself. If you found my review helpful, please thumbs it up and let others see how good this game is.
40	1	a	Good game -&gt; I Enjoy the design/customizable part the most!;

10839	1	a	I love this game. But i have one flaw, or i just suck at the game. How do you get coins? Because i want to unlock the perist class but i dont have enough coins. Otherwise This game is awesome and you should give it a try. Its now one of my favorite mmo's
1259	1	a	Love this game to death. If you're a fan of GTA.. GET THIS! &lt;3
3829	0	a	i'll rather have a wank to susan boyle's pictures using sandpaper than to play this again.

9855	0	a	only the desperate and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ would enjoy this.
7685	0	a	never loads my people
3473	1	a	Good sides: 1) Customization! You can make own death-themes (5 seconds) in a cool midi-editor, you can draw almost any symbol (and put it on any part of clothes, cars). 2) Community. Someone may say that it's all about cheaters, de-threaters or just morons (which always try to ruin your game), but you just should know that quite nice people still exist and you can make new friends just by playing good or making cool stuff (do you remember? - customization!!). 3) Not the worst physics.  Now why I wouldn't recommend this game: 1) Lags. Game really lags even on the newest top PC. Also servers have big tickrate (server-side fps). Sometimes it crashes. 2) Cheaters. Even when FairFight was introduced, cheaters are still a pain in the â¥â¥â¥. But you always can change the district or simply 'do not care'. Or play with friends and make a cheater ragequit! 3) Engine upgrade will never happen (sadly, the game should had been updated 5 or 6 times before I wrote this review, but it has never happened...).
9986	0	a	Post apocaliptic??? Survival game??? WTF, It feels like an mmo, not a survival game. 10/10 ign
1878	1	a	nice graphics its like GTA ONLINE but for free
7227	0	a	Had fun for many hours, until I realized that I kept on getting beaten by lvl 1's because they decided to be P2W and buy rocket launchers and all kinds of crazy â¥â¥â¥â¥.  This game is 80% P2W, and 20% actual fairness.
2926	1	a	Doesnt Support dual screens, so i had to disable a screen to play it, throws you into a game with no information on what you have to do or when or how. all the quests are as followed, go to point Hold the F key. Pick up thing with the F key drive back to start point. get reward. Driving is terrible cars handle like they are on ice every mechanic in the game is clunky and un refined to the point of it being unusable. Quests that use PVP are simply defend point or capture point while killing people that respawn over and over for 10 minutes. when u die ull respawn about a half minute walk away from the action. youll die in 2 hits, they will die in about 2 Clips. no exceptions. camera sways from side to side like your drunk in gta4 with roman. everything about this game is complete â¥â¥â¥â¥. a person i know just said that you have to get used to it, but id rather not lower my standerds of play. The only people that play this are the sad people that cant justify paying for it before it was f2p
2881	1	a	nice game fight

4374	0	a	terrible, the cars are so deylayed
10110	1	a	A lot to do for a new player. Very much like an online, not-so-gore-filled version of Fallout. As a F2P it is expected to be a heavy grinder or Pay for Premium deal. Where you can grind and spend more time to craft, level up abilities, and travel from place to place in game as opposed to a Premium member, but it makes up for it in pure in-game content and a fun post-apocalyptice free-to-play MMO-RPG. Bored often? Create a Fallen Earth account.
10598	0	a	It used to be good, but then the game started adding pay to win features.
1610	1	a	The âJust 5 More Minutesâ Award  Fits Perfect for this ha
2124	1	a	10/10 would f*ck sh*t up again.
9375	0	a	Not a bad game but also not the best game. My only concern about this game is the controls are complete â¥â¥â¥â¥ it makes the game almost unplayable. Another thing is that u have the press either 'Y' or the scroll wheel to toggle the ability to look around and thats kind of stupid. Like i said, not a bad game but also not a good game. If you want this game, by all means get it but i dont recommend it.
7709	0	a	Be all you can't be, in this game everyone wants to be a hacker.
9161	1	a	This game is excellent. It was my first online game to play and though I dont play enough i think it is a great way to be introduced to online gaming. Sadly their are some bugs and problems with lag but these are only minor. Try this game and i am sure you will like!
382	1	a	very fun game, if you want somethingn like GTA this is the game for you.
9157	0	a	Stupid but its ok if you like this kind of stuff
8957	1	a	compare this game to eating a pile of out of date â¥â¥â¥â¥ after being deepthroated by a whale and getting assâ¥â¥â¥â¥ed by a horse and you dont still dont have a good comparison of this game
10183	1	a	Positive: i absolutely love this game although i may not have much hours on it due to how busy i am, i still have some free time to play this game i love the graphics and i love how its not pushing you into doing things (in other words they are not forcing missions on you) i would recommend this game to anyone who loves medium paced games and games that you can basically do whatever you want. the only thing that i am not a big fan of is the price of gas for my atv, other than that this game is overall it is an okay game. Negative: although i may have a good review above i think i should put some negatives in the review. it has extreme lag even for my friend who happens to have great intenet and a beefy pc, the game needs to have seperate servers and it also needs to have a singleplayer added even if the servers cant be added due to money just add a singleplayer mode. i honestly think that the game needs to have a plot that actually goes somewhere, i may not have a ton of hours on it but i can tell by where i am at now the plot goes nowhere. i hate how people can interfere with your missions, it really sucks how i am doing a mission and soe other person can come up and kill everyone so i have to wait a while for them to respawn and have to basically restart. oh and on a recent mission i was not told how to use the weapon that they gave me so it took me 15 minutes to get someone to tell me how to use it and it was too late because i had 30 minutes to do the mission and i didnt finish it in time.  i would give this game a 5/10
6345	0	a	Do not play this game it is terrible and Gamersfirst will probably ban your account that you have spent a lot of your own money on because they ban random people including me for false accusations of hacking, cheating or exploiting.

Despite APB:Reloaded having fun gameplay and a good somewhat worthwhile (and repetetive) experience it is a 'Pay to Win' multiplayer game, where the more money you put into it the more you'll be favoured in-game. Be warned, if you do decide to pay to win, they can and most likely will take your privelages away with a delicious ban, it happened to the infamous me, twice.   Play this game at your own risk, feel free to play it even more when it's taken over by a different company that's somewhat more involved with their community.

1301	1	a	I have been playing this game for a very long time now. It is fast paced, open world and really fun. The character customization is amazing, and makes the game so much more fun. I play on both teams, enforcer and criminal. They both got their pro's and con's but they both have their own playstyle to it. I would recommend this to anyone that likes openworld RPG kind of games.
9180	0	a	I played this game with my buddy Left Shark. He said he didn't really like it because Katy Perry wasn't in it. Honestly, I thought everything was trying to be put together into an RPG game, whilst you see that all there is to it is hilarious death sounds and funny PvP battles with enemies that die after yelling 'DIE!' I really think this game has potential, but I probably won't play it for a while.
9451	1	a	This game took me a little bit to get used to, I am very glad I took the extra time and didnt just stop because now I really enjoy this game. I have put in a decent amount of hours into the game, and I have really become addicted to it. Great crafting set up, decent amount of story type missions for you to do, and actually a pretty friendly community. There are a few things that could really be worked on that I will mention but for the most part a great game.  I very much like the crafting, and sometimes find myself staying in the same shop crafting for hours. You could pretty much completely stay away from anything mission or town wise and be completely happy making yourself food to keep healed up, or use your wide range of healing abilities. You cant completely do that though, there are a few different items that you can not craft, that you would have to get lucky on a drop with or buy from a merchant. From what I have seen you dont get chips(credits) from loot drops though, it seems to come from missions or selling your drops.  The two things that I have noticed that needs improvement are the enemy AI, you can almost walk five feet away from them and have them not notice you at all. The other thing is some of the vagueness on missions. There is not a lot of detial with some of the missions, some of them you really do need to just figure out on your own or ask the help channel for any input.  All and all, I do very much like this game and see myself playing for awhile.  
10592	1	a	Good game hard to understand what to do at first but once you get the hang of it then it becomes an addiction.. well untill you die
9068	1	a	Its like fallout but Free
2546	1	a	This game is basicaly Gta mixed with Saints Row
3579	1	a	I have no clue what I'm doing, but its OK.   I'm having fun while doing it.
3480	1	a	Good Game A Big Maps And I DOnt See Some Bug in The Game And Realy Good Try It Out And You See
2021	1	a	Its a good gmehowever I think everyone wants helicopters, planes, shops and a controller option 
2150	1	a	Hit the streets as a licensed vigilante or hardened criminal in the crime-ravaged metropolis of San Paro where shootouts, car-chases, robbery, and vandalism are all in a day's work. Prove yourself to your chosen organization and you could earn fame, deadly weapons, exotic vehicles, and stylish new clothing; fail.But is too cool
3158	1	a	Awesome Game But The Update Doseint Make Me Play The Game :(
5421	0	a	I don't think I've ever seen a worse MMO and that's my opinion before I even get into the game. When I downloaded it the game complained it didn't know my video card and crashed. Then once I repaired the install it worked fine until I actually launched it and it's running in 800x600 with no way to change it until after character creation. Too much effort to just get in game.  in short, avoid like the plague. There's a reason the game developers went bust.
9075	1	a	Such wasteland, very crafting, wow.
3757	0	a	I have played this game for nearly four years and invested over 1500 hours into the game as well as a god-awful amount of money that I regret each time I spend. I have quit, come back, quit, come back, etc. in a cycle that's really hard to break. Let me just say that I am posting my review of this game as someone who has not been banned and has seen every side of the game and community.  The game is akin to cocaine, if I'm completely honest. At first it's great, but the more you do it the worse it gets and while you know you really should just â¥â¥â¥â¥ing stop you can't.  Some pros of the game include the customization, which is without a doubt top notch - you really don't get much better than the customization they offer. The PVP aspect of it is, over all, fairly entertaining and really quite fun. But that's about where the pros stop.  The cons include an unbalanced threat system to determine matches, micro-transactions (that really aren't all that micro) to get any kind of good customization, cars, weapons, etc., unresponsive devs &amp; GMs (who are inconsistent and biased at best), a hitbox that is the same on the tallest/fattest character as it is on the shortest/skinniest one, an anti-cheat system that is easy to bypass and isn't consistent, and an overall toxic community that honestly reminds me of COD and their never ending comments about what they did to someone's mom last night.  As much as I hate it I will keep playing it. I honestly don't understand why. I hate the game, I hate the community, and yet at the same time I hold out that hope that one day G1 will be worth a â¥â¥â¥â¥ and actually fix the damn thing.  TL;DR: if you're not already playing the game, don't.
6591	0	a	Awful... Just awful
1342	1	a	fun game to play when you wanna kill some biittchees.
8017	0	a	If you don't spend money you wont have a chance
6988	0	a	Nope. This game has absolute potential, but new players are vulnerable to hackers and higher ranks with overpowered weapons. Don't waste your time installing this game, unless you want to get blown up by a pornstar with an RPG and rage over it. The only good thing about APB: Reloaded is the character customization. Not friendly to newcomers, you have to pay2win. Uninstalled immediately.
6489	0	a	Honestly, I really like this game. Its free to play and fun to play but it always glitches and lags too much to even pretend to play. If it wasnt for that Id highly recomend it but there seems to be no fix for the lag and whatnot 
4403	0	a	Bought APB when it originally came out, glad that's it's 'free2play', shame that it's now 'pay2win', and if you wanna win, it's not cheap. One thing I really do love in this game: Customisation. There is so much customisation in this game; customising you're custom character with custom items that can be customised with custom created patterns, that's a seriously impressive amount of customisation. Which is why I don't understand, with the wealth of cosmetic options available, why all the 'real money' items can't just be the 'cosmetic' ones. From tattoos to new hair styles to the 100's of clothing items (of which more can be created) and bazillions of combinations that this gives you, there is surely enough content there to continue to fund this game without selling overpowered weaponry. Path of Exile does it. Path of Exile doesn't even have much customisation. But no. pay2win Well, you'll have the occasional fun match with equally skilled, equally equipped players, but only 'occasionally'. More than often, you'll be pitted against player's that have forked out for the massively 'over-powered-death-weapons-of-instant-death' weaponry, and then any skill you've aquired at playing well; will mean naught. If you've just won the lottery and want to spend it in a game where overpowered weaponry destroys all form of difficulty and balance then this is for you. If not, than you can still try the game out, it's 'free2play' after all, but I doubt you'll stay long.
7211	0	a	Stupid game with no real excitement
1707	1	a	good game but it has some stability issues
10437	0	a	it definetly isnt a fallout game nor dayz but it's fun the pvp isnt really 'good' as you would say the weapon's literaly are nerfed alot since the last time i played and i didnt alpy it alot but i mean yeah it's a open wor;d apocalypse game but the pvp isnt worth downloading this for.

2141	1	a	This game is fun... If you have friends to play it with! Very few things I can say about it... theres honestly not that much to it.  *Logs In* *Sees Friend* *Watches friend get ran over*   Thats pretty much the game.    10/10 Would watch friend die again.
7619	0	a	all the horrible things are true..... so true..... PLUS if you play as bandit you just randomly surrender.  this game will lower your opinion of the human race no matter how bad it already was
6633	0	a	Everytime I ever tried to play, it kicked me. Super.
5582	0	a	Can't get it to launc Wtf
10671	1	a	A fun little MMO with its own bitz of fun! It's a fast-paced, bullet hell, bit game with some pretty decent tracks. Honestly the game did a great job for what it is. It may have a few problems and there is room for improvement. Really you should just hop on if you want a quick and free bullet hell, but also invite your friends. Other than that Great game overall.  8.4/11 -Dj Shady
7601	0	a	This game had a good cocept when the previous company had it. This game can be fun, but every single server you will encounter hackers and more bs. It's mostly a buy to win game, and they're milking it at this point.
215	1	a	Really addicting. Its like GTA and Cops and Robbors just had a baby.
8756	0	a	Poor Tutorial, no player base.
2313	1	a	I like this game because its very good action, more than more weapon, and its pretty!
1040	1	a	Brick killed a guy.  10/10
1765	1	a	lots of fun
9514	1	a	Fun for quite a while actually for a long time for me but it gets boreing after a bit (played solo most of the time)
506	1	a	This is an awesome game,but all you need to know that, -It wont be easy out there you new players -Dont rage quit -Have fun -Have fun more by playing with friend -Love your character -Ignore the people with the nazi symbol -Ignore the hcker
5519	0	a	Game is terrible , I forgot what Ragequitting was until I played this game .Matchmaking is beyond broken ,the missions in this game are repititive and dumb as Sh*t(Vip Missions).This game gets updated frequently and yet 4 years later still running into the same problems.If 'Gamer'sFirst' Couldn't fix it 4 years back they sure as hell can't fix it now.   Bottom Line I DO NOT reccomend this game to anyone.
10162	1	a	good times. scavange. explore. craft a 2x4 and hit stuff.
424	1	a	Its very fast pace for a game like this but still is fun!
9377	1	a	Its a fun little expience a that really captures the postapolticalic feeling despite it s graphics
6952	0	a	cant run it so i got a new laptop for this game. still â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ on my heart with crappyness (update) i had some fun then realized irs â¥â¥â¥â¥ and dedownloaded it  â¥â¥â¥â¥/7
8015	0	a	The game wont even start from the launcher 10/10 would never play because it wont even start.
4711	0	a	Overall 5/10  keep in mind this may improve over time but as of now its not a good game. The base layer ishre for a great game, an open wrord Grand Theft Auto type climate. However soon after you start it bogs you down. The tutorial is terrible and while optional stays on screen till you complete it all(which is very hard. The biggest issues are the driving and shooting mechanices. They are terrible! The fun you have in this game goes away once combat starts. You often will die wihout seeing your enemy or become frustrated with how many imes yu have to hit your enemy for them to die. From far away they will simple run o cover. Up clsoeand the targeting system(or lack their of) and zoom make it exteremly difficult to kill someone. If your super sneaky you'll go far.  Again this could improve depending on changes
3486	1	a	I really don't have much to say since I didn't get pass the loading screen
8099	0	a	Its a pay to win game!!  Was fun at first before they got greedy and now only cheaters and people with credit cards play. AVOID THIS GAME!!
10658	1	a	It is very fun but when you die your so mad at it. 
5770	0	a	pay to play, laggy, crap. dont wast your time
973	1	a	i love this game too bad my laptop is too â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and cant play it smoothly 7/10
3129	1	a	BEST game EVER
7386	0	a	A game with great potential, ruined by what only can be described as incompetent developers. This game is mechanically unbalanced and unintentionally designed to bring out the worst in people, and despite the crappy engine the game is built upon that would prevent quick changes on larger scale issues, the game still commits simple game design sins, the biggest one being selling mechanics as premium items.  This is the ONE THING YOU DONT DO IN A F2P GAME, it's the quickest way to unbalance the game beyond the developers control, and the prices in the store are beyond extortionate and exploitative. Despite the various lead developers and community managers that move in and out of the company (which really makes you wonder what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ is going on), apparently no-one collectively sees this as enough of an issue to fix.  It's sad then that it's still the MMO i've played for the most time, but to be honest im hoping now that another much more intelligent developer will make something that encapsulates the brilliance of this games concept and actually be able to make it good, as i've given up on hoping Reloaded Games recognises these elements as actual problems.
10825	1	a	I don't know why peopleare giving this a thumbs down. This game is amazing!
6133	0	a	This game sucks. I can only describe it as being the largest waste of time that you can ever experience in a concentrated amount of time. That being said, I had a lot of fun playing it. And I don't know why.
966	1	a	Fun A lot of drama though.
7309	0	a	i could ont get it to work 
928	1	a	Its like Saints row, but free
5258	0	a	First things first, this game gave me high blood pressure         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Best of Frankie&nbsp;
8305	0	a	Matches people who have been playing the game for a few minutes against those who have been playing for hundreds of hours. Matchmaking is the most â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ thing I've ever seen, good luck getting matched against people you might actually be able to beat.
9905	1	a	Fallen Earth has ups and downs, in my opinion. It has a massive world, with lots of different choices.  And some of the downsides are things like all the good armour looks like it just hopped out of an 80s movie, and you have to be perfectionist careful to level up properly, or else your entire character is doomed.
4906	0	a	As fun as the multiplayer is, if you have computer with anybit less than minimum, you will have nightmares of lag and latency. this game is far more taxing to a computer than anyone would expect.
10669	0	a	Worst game ever played. (not gameplay wise)  I put settings to fullscreen i get a shop popup and now i cannot play the game anymore cause i cannot take it off and i cannot change back from fullscreen to windowed cause of it. tried uninstallig it several times didnt reset options. dont recommend to anyone.
1370	1	a	you can be fat and steal a tv
6740	0	a	i cant even play this game my server doesnt work
640	1	a	Was good for me, but they have to fix the people you get matched against... I don't like getting â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
2490	1	a	Why do I keep coming back to this game? I honestly can call this my first MMO RPG
7329	0	a	I want to like this game. It has the potential to be fun. It's mechanics are great. The idea behind it amazing. But alas, it lacks the one thing any PVP game requires: Balance. It advertises a tutorial server that doesn't exist, so you're tossed into the thick of things to learn the game. It doesn't tell you controls, mission types, or anything of the sort, and the worst of it all is the utter lack of balance. A fresh off the boat character will be matched against gold level players wielding rocket launchers and LMG's that may as well be classified as ranged chainsaws. It's not newbie friendly at all, and it doesn't give you a chance to learn the game before putting you against people who live and breath the game. I can't recommend this, as much as I want to enjoy it.
1137	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
501	1	a	APB Reloaded is a really great game, Soo many games out there yet all feel like we're all clones doing the samething over and over again. APB, doesn't have that feeling everyones different you'll never find someone that has the same look or style as you do. Imagine your favorite character from anything... well with APB being so free, you can make that said character in game. Don't let the reviews saying 'Oh its a Pay 2 Win game' change your mind about APB just about every game has in game purchases that's whats starting to happen everywhere(Lower dem Arma Prices Dow dat shiz cray).. It's the little things that make life even better with friends this game.. is one of those little things in a gamers life you won't RAGRET...Don't forget everyone gets a little upset when they die and may insult you after just make sure to WHISPER so you won't wake up the neighbors.. So download this game get in San Paro and kill some (Insert curse word here).. xP
4265	0	a	If your a hacker. Play this game cause there literally is no hacker prevention here. If your a regular player, avoid this game at all costs. Until removal of all hackers, game will remain bs unless played with friends.
9728	0	a	10/10 if you wanna meet hitler and attract Aids x Cancer. Otherwise if your smart you will get the achievement for uninstalling.
4602	0	a	Very bad experience wth this game: Launching this game messes up the whole steam client. Even after i close the game steam still shows it running in my status and everything else, now one would think as to restart the client to fix this but steam does not exit when a game is running, so it keeps requesting me to close the game first before exiting while it is already closed!(Also,you cannot launch the game again as it is already running according to steam)...sticky situation xD. then i have to use the task manager to manually terminate all steam processes and start steam again. Pretty tedious right? and this was just a single issue out of the many this game brings to the system. I could write about more issues but it would make this review too long, so in conclusion: very bad personal experince=would not recommend to anyone.
8472	0	a	It was fun. I would recommend it if it wasnt P2W now. Sadly they ****ed up this game. It was a great game tho !
7626	0	a	Play this if you want to get screwed by hackers and people who payed for their guns. It's the perfect example of Free-2-Pay crap.
3003	1	a	cant recommend because i couldnt get it running ?/10

1333	1	a	Most definitely one of the best games I've played. Fantastic graphics, fun gameplay, and with all you can customize with your player and such is awesome. One downside is it seems to be poorly optimized. I can run medium graphics on most, if not all of my other games but this one has a horrible lag issue. Other than that, fantastic game.

1599	1	a	A godd gta-i game its a fun TPS the costumazation is endless going from masks to tattos but a lot of cool features need premium acc whitch requires real invested money,there is no single player but the multiplayer ist that much laggy and the grapich are deccent for a free game.The controls are tricky but the options menu takes care of that.I would reccomend this game to any gta fan ,
6029	0	a	It's meh, i've come to realize at this point this game largely filled with the aspect of P2W which is basically you buy premium and get a bonus of 100% for everything along with that hackers are known and don't get dealt with. So far i've sent in three support tickets with suspected cheaters and gave clear images along with links with there emails and names tied to hacking sites that confirm that they do pay for cheats for atleast another game at the best.   They've responded to one and still haven't replied with any others, the support ticket I was responded was a giant robotic reply which basically is summed up as the TLDR version; 'We will look into the matter, however we can't tell you anything about the player due to privacy concerns, etc, etc'. It's been 48 hours now and hes been hackusated by a entire server and multiple people accuse him of speedhacking which he abused along with his aimbot.  The P2W aspect is that for a meesly $5 you can get a Perm gun of four choices that are usually really good and do indeed own the free versions, you get a free car which is also nice along with 500 G1C credits and 31 days of membership. With that you've basically made it so you're going to outlevel normal players by atleast 60% faster and don't have to waste your money on guns and cars early rather saving up and being able to purchase the end-games guns and cars soon as they're unlocked for you. However the most P2W element is the Arma weapons themself due the fact you're able to purchase much stronger versions of the F2P guns at much lower ranks along with having unique perks such as silencers, better modifiers, etc.
1070	1	a	A truly unique gaming experience, almost endless character and gear customization, fast-paced FPS action, and the timelessness of cops vs robbers.

10078	1	a	great game
1311	1	a	i enjoyed it very much but it does kind of fall under the p2w category sadly but over all it was pretty good
6087	0	a	APB Realoaded...okay here have a look at this first: The Pros -Character customazation i guess? Well its pretty good. -You Get to choose what faction you want to be. Well that's a pretty good add since most games are like 'OH HEY UR A GUD GUY WIT SUCKISH CLOTHS!' -Cars. Yeah that's awesome. Annddd...That's it. The Cons -Pay To Win. Yeah we all died from a person with an OP gun in this game, because wasting money on a free game is a good idea. -No new game modes. -The Fact you have to have a monster PC to run this â¥â¥â¥â¥. Hey i managed to run Far Cry 3 and Payday 2 before why the â¥â¥â¥â¥ does this lag so much?  -â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ community. Wow everywhere i go someone is like 'â¥â¥â¥â¥ you im better then you' i tried asking help to get started and the awnser is 'Learn that yourself you dumb â¥â¥â¥â¥'.   4/10 Dont waste your time and Computer Space on this â¥â¥â¥â¥.
10555	0	a	game loaded at 100% and stopped, nothing else to do ..
6653	0	a	If you trade legendary items you get banned for scamming. So either buy it with ingame money or don't trade weapons at all.
9766	0	a	It is â¥â¥â¥â¥.
4123	0	a	I personally didn't like it. It was very confusing and I didn't know what was going on a lot of the time. I felt like I was forced into quests when I had no clue what to do. Not only that, but the lag was horrible. Everything mixed together and made a very bad experience for me and I was discouraged to play again and because of that I never played it again so I just uninstalled it. Thankfully it's a F2P, so if you want to give it a try, I won't stop you.

8104	0	a	The game play component has two modes, join a mission district and press k to get shot at, or join an action district and have the game press k for you, so you can get shot at sooner, as well as having more people to shoot at you. As for the ranking system, with the aid of mommys credit card it can join the plot over in the corner, ever so often clear its throat and stretching a little , and mumbling something along the lines of 'this game isnt pay to win, you can unlock all the weapons as you progress through the game' to which you will reply 'what about the weapons i cant unlock through the game' right before resumes its silent vigil. All points bullitin caters to a unique few, the extremely rich, the extremely close, and the devs, the cash shop redundifies any and all attempts at proggression, while also placing some out of reach weaponery into the game, as for the joker store...suffice to say its a joke (see what i did there). All Lag Bullitin has optomization issues, that would give the dialup era of online gaming a run for its money when it comes to unreliability, the server is secretly the worlds most advanced rng as it has awareness, but many years of neglect have lead it to become resentful of humanity and thus you will find in your moment of need, when you are soo close to murdering Xx_rApEdyeMUMm8_xX and restoring honor to you family the server will get distracted and forget to register... well anything, and after a quick game of he said she said you are shuffled along to the respawn screen, the game is horribly unreliable unless you the lucky few, then you have nothing to worry about youll be sything down noobs and veterans alike blessed by the almighty apb god we call server, with the lag armor. Having said all this there are some good points to apb such as the customization.... yup thats the only redeeming quality, if this were a fashion world simulator it would be enough, but in a badly optimized tps (third person shooter) it just means you'll look pretty while your ragdoll lays on the floor, and theres not much else to redeem the game.  in conclusion the devs are bad, the game mechanics are bad, the servers are bad, the community is   toxic garbage, left behind by the civilized word, gained sentience and decided to stage a perverse mockery of a community   bad, the funeral clothes creater is indepth and well designed.    TL;DR the games bad, unless you spend your time in bronze, then you can enjoy countless hours of blissful ignorance, while you skip along to the sound of angry 12 yearolds
8552	0	a	Worst third person shooter I've ever played. Hackers everywhere, never miss a shot and can see you coming on radar you don't have. Pointless to play even with money.
5837	0	a	when it first came out i loved it, though i could only run it on 10 fps., now several years later with a new pc i tried it agian, and i have never been so disapointet... when you are new to the game you join pvp games where your teammates are just as â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ as you are, but your opponents is insanely high rank and ofc. also pay to win so even if you snipe them 5 times in head before they even see you, they just turn around and instagib you with ump or a handgun. so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing broken because of some greedy developers!
5434	0	a	piece of crap in my opinion
8050	0	a	When i looked at screenshoots i really thought that this game is amazing. But unfortunatelly i discovered it is not so good as it looks. Stupid quests, useless customization... It is just not â¥â¥â¥â¥ing fun to play this â¥â¥â¥â¥. It sucks for real. So i really NOT RECOMMEND to play this game, because its nothing but wasting of your time.
10338	1	a	It kept me busy before fallout and will keep me busy after fallout, great game great community. Does need new content badly though. Until then there is still lots to explore and do. Totally addicted
2701	1	a	I recommend this game to all because it has that good gta side and the saints row the third customization to it it is also really fun too your character can be a cop or a criminal you can have your own crew ive seen team joker army and a bunch more stuff so donwload now
6563	0	a	Hate games that have optimisation, interesting quests, no camping spots, civilian AI and don't let you win if you give them money? Then APB is the game for you. Bet you want to play a bad guy too because being evil is soooo hardcore. Well you are in luck as the criminals always defend so you get to stay nice and snug while camping the point with your insta kill assault rifle that you splashed money on while those silly ol' goodies run at you with pea shooters. You sure are great at video games!  I should point out that the character customisation is brilliant as it lets you change just about every little feature but this is counterbalanced by every player you walk by having the green cap and jeans model as they never load in time.
7025	0	a	This game is broken, very little actual gameplay mostly just go from A to b to C and fight people with no clear objective. Cars feel like they are on ice. to get any acutal upgrades u need to pay. Most players cheat or are useing hacks. stay very far away from this game. 0/10
10211	1	a	I will keep this simple. It is basically Fallout as an mmo. 10/10 Takes some getting used to though. :/
3890	0	a	Their support is terrible and you will get randomly banned at any point in time.  Their system 'fair-fight' is a mockup puppet system which allows they to flag any account and make it look like they where detected.  Save your money and do not support this company.
5478	0	a	Too many â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s be stupid spending their hard-earned money just to make â¥â¥â¥â¥ing new players hate this motherâ¥â¥â¥â¥ing game, I mean seriously, GET YOUR LIVES OUT OF YOUR â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ ASSES! Too many premium players are bullying newcomers, all games SHOULD HAVE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING balance on your matchmaking and not let premium guns get SO OVER-â¥â¥â¥â¥ING-POWERED. I hate when these â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s just bully and pick on people to make them rage. I think it is unethical and just plain annoying, that's all I have to say.

9479	0	a	The game is pure awesome in a Fallout 3-like world (with a bit of green) with Multiplayer. There is also first-person view mode by using the Mouse Wheel (or pressing F9), so you can play it like an FPS game as well as the usual Third Person.  There is about 6 different *big* Regions to explore, Missions (some can be done co-operatively), Person Vs Monster with set PVP Zones shown on the maps, Factions, Crafting numerous items such as Snipers/Pistols/SMG's &amp; other stuff, Scavenging, Leveling up, Auctions, use Vehicles like Cars/ATVs/Motorbikes/Horses, Clans, Riots, and a whole lot more.  I've played this game for at least 4000 Hours by now (even donated at least $80), and I must say it's a very good Free To Play Game. If you donate at least $10 by buying something from the Marketplace, you get a LOT of extras for being a first-time purchaser.

3912	0	a	Extremely P2P, virtually impossible to keep your gear, unless you pay ofcourse
10172	1	a	after playing for 41 hours i can tell you that this game is epic! theres soooo much to do like go hunting doing side quests or working towards gathering richers or building an atv or motorcycle or spending your riches on worthless thing when you start out just like i did   you can sit for hours killing and scaverging just to sit for hours and craft   but be carefuyl when further out in the wastes there are many CHOTA(chidren of the apocolipse) fortresses or towns out there and some of em can be full of dangers and well hundreds of CHOTA   overall i would give 12/10

1629	1	a	Nice third person shooter game, i recommen this to everybody!
4584	0	a	This game is a mess. Tried to like it so I could play with friends, but just...it isn't fun. Spawnkilling is commonplace, and the community is toxic. It drove me away too fast and the game seems awful to me. I wouldn't recommend this until Reloaded Games gets their â¥â¥â¥â¥ in line and fixes this game.
1265	1	a	Great game I played it for 8h and bought vip its so fun and good def recomend
8366	0	a	This a great game, but the community sucks... And the Support don't care about you just care about your pocket if you have money they will accept it, but if you need help they will just ignore you or say that they can't do nothing for you. So that's why I don't like this game, but I'm already addicted, I'm getting cancer and bla bla... So for your life if you want to be happy and get a family one day don't play this game.
2934	1	a	Fun if you have friends to play with
3718	1	a	Pay2win? Dude star is op as â¥â¥â¥â¥
3209	1	a	This game is actually really fun once you get past the steep learning curve. It will put you through hell in the start but once you get used to it things do get a lot better. The only downside is the hackers that run around but they are rare to run into. Just play for fun and and all is well.  I have to edit this review because although it can be a fun game, and it's not necessarily a bad game, this game is dated. There's supposedly going to be an engine upgrade and it seems like it's never coming but it's suppose to be soon. And with that, more bugs! The few things this game lacks is innovation and optimization. Match making is terrible, guns are hardley ever balanced and servers are still not up to par.  I'm still recommending this game for those wishing to play something with a GTA Online feel that's free to play.
9827	0	a	never played 10/10
3245	1	a	super cool game, awesome gameplay and style. there is a awesome comunnity if you arent good at the game cause if you rek people you hack. but there is a good antihack system in this game so hackers are rare. i can totaly recomand this game, find a clan with teamspeak and you can spend years on this game.

1793	1	a	A mix between CS, GTA and Barbie (what other game lets you design your own clothes, including hand-made decals?).  Good stuff, though it's completely unfriendly to casuals.
10476	1	a	Ok so, where do I start? This game was a game I was very fond of (As my time spent playing it might show) and I've already written a review before but since it was kinda choppy I stepped upon it again and decided to add to it.  I've been playing this game for around 4 years back when I started around 2012 when I was also first introduced to steam, so along with downloading TF2 this game caught my eye as my love of post-apoc settings for games sparked my intrigue. Back then, this game just had so much to offer, to me in particular as I was fine with discovering most of it for myself with managing to obtain an ATV early on.   In terms of gameplay, the whole grinding aspect didn't really bother much as I was still managing to have fun cooperating with various people I would meet around placed like Embry (I think that was the name of the main S1 city?) and City where there was an event to protect a town made up by players from enemy mobs (Called Shivas If I'm correct) where you would see people showing off their cool gear and mounts.  The PvP aspect of the game was never really anything I tapped into, It just didnt really intrest me, but I'm sure theres some players out their who saw its potential.  To end this review of, no matter how bad it is, I guess this game is kinda dead with its peak being off in the earlier years where I made a few friends on my way to Lvl 55.  If anyone remembers me, my main characters name was Brad Carson, with other names like Pvt.Brad being another char of my mine, and to anyone who remembered me, It was a pleasure having played a fun game with you for quite a few years.   Sorry if this review was pretty bad, I'm just really getting over a lot.
5325	0	a	Holy crap. What did I expect in this game? A hell of a lot more. A hell of a lot more... I expected more GTA-like aspects/mechanics, but that's just detail. No, what I truly expected was more free stuff. This game boasts Free 2 Play, and yet it cannot guarantee it. Just another â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ MMO game with a rental system. Remember Combat Arms? Well, that â¥â¥â¥â¥ deserved to get haxxor'd. All this renting nonsense and stuff like that... WHAT? At the very least make us WORK for the items. But nope, the developers of this game decided to create another one of THOSE games, which require us players to throw money at them every so often. Do not play this unless you really enjoy paying people for â¥â¥â¥â¥ products.
8941	1	a	This game has a huge map, hundreds of different weapons, armors, and enemies, there aren't many people that are on, but its an old as â¥â¥â¥â¥ game, everyone in the community knows each other well, sure you can't really do pvp at lower levels, since most people are at the max level, there is a market for buying items with real money, but these are mostly things to make you go through the game faster or vanity, most of the community is very helpful and will randomly give out expensive items that you can sell and make money off of like I did, skill leveling is based on getting exp by crafting and killing, then you put skill points into a skill, mutation or attribute, attributes raise caps on mutations and skills, attribute caps are raised with leveling. Crafting is done with the tradeskills, which are raised by crafting/harvesting. I could go on, but itd be a 10 page document, so I won't
2022	1	a	Even though this game is like grand theft auto it has missions,clans and other things.

537	1	a	help... i... cant.. stop....
7445	0	a	WAAAAY back in the day I was picked to alpha test this game. The entire community of testers told the Devs time and again that they needed to add things to APB other than pure PvP for the game to work. Unfortunately, they never listened to their potential customers, the game did terribly, and the original devs ended up closing shop because of it! Now that it's been out for a while on the F2P market I figured I would give it a try, to see if the game has matured into something other than what it used to be. Sadly, nothing has been changed. The same glitches are in the game, and even with a &lt;60 ping latency the server still bugs out when there's a lot of people in one place.   If all you're interested in is running and gunning against other players then have at it, otherwise I would recommend other games like The Secret World that are on the F2P market.
1924	1	a	Customizations are similar (in the aspect of making your character) if not better than the Saints Row series. You can create unlimited customizations when it comes to clothing, decals for your vehicles, how you dress, etc. This game really brings out the inner-self and really allows you to express yourself through a video game. You can create 8-bit songs that are used for your theme when you kill a player, thus they can hear that little song every time they die from you.  You can also add mods to your guns and to yourself. This helps you by killing the opposition that much quickly. The combat is fun and fluid â very fast, aggressive, and determined to finish off your opponent in a timely manner by any means necessary (e.g. sniper, grenades, rocket launcher, running them down via vehicle, etc.). The game is like GTA/SR having a child with a MMO. The game is rather big and has numerous districts all which have their own quests and purpose that pertains to each district.   There is a social district where you can go to buy stuff from the local auction house, customize your own gear, socialize with other members of APB, and chillax after a few rounds of fast, paced gameplay.
9215	0	a	Fallen Earth is an excelent thought, but it has crapy controlles and graphics. They also did not put a lot of time on fixing glitches in the graphics.I would not recommend this to anyone that wants to have fun.
4696	0	a	This game is a bunch of bull crap. People with pay to play weapons, percs, tricked out vechiles ruining your day as you a wee low level try to get one perc. Hackers have kinda been dealt with but still some. Used to be a huge horde of hackers. Game can kinda get addicting if you manage to get atiny bit good or have high level clan mates to carry you. And 'DLC', Pay to win weapons, car decorations are stupidly expensive. Complete waste of your money.You could be spending it on better things. Would not recommend.
9525	1	a	I liked this game alot it definately can submerge you in quests and loot farming, searching for parts.
4365	0	a	APB is like Donald Trump, exciting and amusing at first, but once you get past the bull â¥â¥â¥â¥, it starts to dawn on you how bad they are.  I've had history with this game, and decided to come back. I was bored and needed something to do. Here's a synopsis of how a day in APB goes. 1. Take 30 minutes to log in. 2. Spawn into the world and I become Nightcrawler, with the ability to teleport short distances. 3. Steal a car, try to drive, go across everything but the road. 4. Ready up for a mission, it's a 1v1, guy is already at the objective as we start, i'm 200m away. 5. I meet up with the enemy with my default weapon, fps and lag cooperate to make me spray like hell and somehow get a kill 6. Repeat. 7. Enemy corner Camps objective. 8. He wins. 9. Try to get a better weapon. 10. Don't have enough money. 11. Only way to get a lot is to do missions. 12. I realize I can't do missions with a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ gun. 13. I try anyway. 14. Guy with shotgun shoots my car while I'm stuck trying to get out of a wall. 15. I blow up. 16. Deletes APB. If you have a beefy computer and like to spend money this game is for you.
1940	1	a	One of my all time favorite games. Too many hours have been spent playing it. Lots of customization with generic TPS combat.

5729	0	a	Could be a great game, too bad its actual â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Its like GTA except covered in actual hackers and scumbags, even if you manage to try and fight as befitting a gangman (drive-by) you end up deader than a blood in crip territory alone. (Vehicle explodes in half an enemy mag).  I mean if you like stealing furniture like its the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Rodney King riots then I guess it's okay.
221	1	a	Your review cannot be empty
7522	0	a	Filled with bugs and really badly written. Should be alpha mora than an actual release.
1500	1	a	APB:Reloaded is a fun game, but not without its flaws. Its like GTA, but better, at least in terms of gameplay and customization.  Pros:   1. You can customize pretty much everything, you can take a duck symbol, put it on a wall, then your character, your clothes, and your car, and actaully be unique.  2. The game play is supurb, there's no BS like headshots or or having to worry about your teammate running you over because 'lag'. The games gunplay is also really good, it is RNG based so a few weapons dont like hitting things, but other wise really good.  3. The game caters to a lot of types of people, more so those who can design, It can bring out everys inner creativity if you let it.   Cons:  1. Performance is WAY down in the dumps, heavy stuttering, and highly populated zones can cause serious FPS drops.  2. Server performance is also poor, the RNG and hitbox systems seem to hate Shotguns the most. As well as random 'visual' oddities that can sometimes be manipulated at will.  3. The game has been suffering from hackers/cheaters but as of recent, that has died down a lot. But sometimes, due to lag, you may see people 'snap' or moonwalking, so its sometimes hard to tell.  4. The ARMAS market place can get pretty pricey, $60 for one account permanent gun is quite high.   All in all, its a fun game, but only if you can ignore the client and server performance issues. Keep an eye out for the Engine upgrade next year though, that should nullify a majority of performance issues that we are seeing.
7272	0	a	This game is the 1 of the biggest POS games iv played in a while it automaticly made me a account and set the date to 2015 so cant even play it on the â¥â¥â¥â¥ list it right next to nether witch i can nolonger play cus it did almost the same thing but its linked to my steam account so i cant make a new account
2849	1	a	for a free2play, its pretty darn good :)
1552	1	a	Used to be really good. Now it's mostly about who can pay the most to win. Yet you can still enjoy it sometimes.
5340	0	a	4/10
4327	0	a	Not bad but its p2w
5675	0	a	This is a great game. This game is a sandbox MMO like GTA but with more customization options. The only problem with this game is the overwhelming amount of cheaters and the game lack of action to stop them. You can find cheat for this game with a quick Google search. So unless you're willing to buy to cheat or get lucky enough to be teamed with someone who has, your going to spend 75% of your time playing this game being killed repeatedly by one person with ungodly ability to know where you and your teammates are at all times and has perfect aim.
6504	0	a	Pay to impress kind of game. I would not buy if you not willing to pay alot of money. Good gameplay just very limited if you havent paid for extra content that should be free.
3134	1	a	Awsome game!
3665	1	a	It`s ok to play, i like it
564	1	a	Rage PB anyone?
1566	1	a	much die so law enforcement  very MMO wow.
119	1	a	!!!!!
1824	1	a	One of the best, if not THE best free to play MMO out there, i enjoy this game A LOT.  I hear from a lot of people that this game is 'pay to win', you can't do good without paying... this is however wrong! you can do great at this game without paying a single dime, the first gun you start out with for example, is one of the best guns in the game, while not great in close quarters, it is awesome at medium range. All of the guns in the game has some weaknesses, find the weakness and USE IT!  You go out and do missions and after a while you get up to 100k-200k money, you can get a great car form the marketplace, the money takes some time to farm up, but it you don't spend it all on clothes or whatever it goes pretty fast.  this is a truly great game, for what it is.
888	1	a	Really cool game, a lot of customization! While it's pay to win, you can dominate every player, just depends on how good you are in the game! And really, It's free. You have nothing to lose! :)
7616	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this â¥â¥â¥â¥ the game is fake you w8 3 houreews to download and then you can even launch the game...
7198	0	a	This game is really bad.
447	1	a	This is a 3rd person shooter PVP based game with some very good customization options. There really is no PVE so don't try playing if you're looking for a co-op GTA type game. It's 100% PVP based.  The character customization is really good &amp; there is also an art kiosk to make your own designs.  This is what I made a while back when I last played.         The Hog Mobile&nbsp;
7992	0	a	so last year i wrote a review on this game where i rougly said: gameplay is junk, the people who play it are jerks... it's pay 2 win... it's sloppy, the controls responds slowly and the graphics load slower then a snail could win a god damn marathon.  BUT THE CUSTOMIZATION IS GOOD!  thats everything positive... the clothing and tattoos... if they had this kind of custom items in a game like grand theft auto it would be the BIGGEST GAME EVER... but it dosen't, it's the worst damn â¥â¥â¥â¥ i've tried...  do NOT try it! if you have ever tried playing a first person shooter and someone kills you repeadetly thats only the tip of the iceberg, here you will be kicked off servers by punkbuster because someone SAID you were hacking  i was stupid enough to recommend this only for customisation but i regret this now...  NO! do NOT play this...  I CAN'T WARN YOU ENOUGH! DON'T.... DO IT!!!!
8851	0	a	Has something gta 5 dosent, blinkers. Other than that this game is terrible, stay the â¥â¥â¥â¥ away.
7914	0	a	I am sick i this shity game because ost of the robbers are hackers useing thier aim bot and it so easy for them to get money and who idea was it to have a rocket launcher thats thing is too over powered  Fix this game  JarJarGamer
6659	0	a	Before, this game was great. Good community, good updates. Now it's the complete opposite.  Unless you want to play the same thing over and over, same mission and what not, go ahead. But it's as bland as plain oatmeal. Usually the maximum of 7 people on fighting districts. The only thing that's good is the exit button.
10733	1	a	Best game ever at times then the Worst game at others but was defently more fun before the KABAM nation attacked. Turining the game a liltle Pay-to-win 
6649	0	a	For the most part the game is fun if playing with the right people. For there are only two types of people one will find in this game. Over powered and skilled players and a person who is going to play for a week and rage out. This game is usually fun for about a half hour before it dawns upon players that it is one of the buggiest almost dead free to play games in the market. In the end even though the game has one of the most interesting and advance character/vehicle customization beyond that it is lacking in every field and leave much if not all to be desired.
8217	0	a	A crapy waste of space do not get
9026	1	a	Very good game, good gameplay , good graphics. I recommend it.
10684	1	a	Okay, this is a tricky game to review, so bear with me.   The people think that the game is just 'pay to win' now aren't exactly right. Of course there is still buying items and you can't get some items without buying them with USD or other currency, but that doesn't mean you necessarily have to buy the items to have fun in the game. You can have just as much fun without buying items.    Second, you can't just play this game for 5 minutes, die by a sumo wrestler and review this game bad.   You cannot be good at this game in a whiff, practice is needed      Some people seem to forget the difference between a terrible game and a really hard game. This is not a terrible game. Kabam has not ruined this game, they have just tried their best to make a profit on Realm of the Mad God, because they bought it, you think it's going to be cheap buying a popular game?    Anyways, it has mindless fun. Once you become good with this game, it gets fun doing the events like the Lord of the Lost Lands, and see the new dungeons like the Ice Cave and the Puppet Master's Theater (yeah, you like those dungeons don't you guys, they were from KABAM!) And the most satisfying moment is when you go to a dungeon hoping for something rare and   you get what you want.   It is so satisfying.      The features of the game
4184	0	a	Worst game ever. If u want to do anything that is not dying, pay $100 or ull have weapons that kills after 2 magazines oh shooted bullets. But if ull pay about $200 you can even try to kill somebody with ur 2 shoot kill machine gun. ULTRA PAY 2 WIN GAME .
3210	1	a	A great game of skill, stragagy and car surfing! I highly recomend this game to anyone.
3887	0	a	This game sucks. You basically have to hack to get kills. Movement is glitchy and to nerfed to even play. If you are a F2P don't bother, all the people who have stuff are already better then you, forcing you to get the DLCs. Don't play this game.
10377	0	a	wasteoftime/10
8986	1	a	Fallen Earth is very good free to play post apocalyptic MMO. It reminds of Fallout for some odd reason that I can't see to figure out. The world is really well done and the combat is satisfying enough to keep you engaged. If you like post apocalyptic games and MMO's as well this is the game for you.
1735	1	a	The besty adreniline rushing game and addicting game ever played 
6931	0	a	This game helped me learn that being cooperative and working together is the key to success.  Unfortunately, none of this happens. You either get called a noob, hacker, or just get frustrated.... Because in the end, all you will hear is the sound of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ quality music playing through your teammates mic.   The only reason you should play this game is if you have friends that will play with you. This game is nothing without cooperation.   For these reasons I do not recommend this game.
8141	0	a	Do not get this game, unfair, pay to win and no fun to play at all :/
7657	0	a	buggy as hell and doesnt want to load the game and if you do get in the game you might get about two min with the game before it crashes. i dont recommend this game to anybody.
1501	1	a	I played APB Reloaded back during release for well over a year. I really enjoyed it. From making custom sprays for your vehicle right down to making new friends. The community was very enjoyable too! The amount of customization just keeps growing as time passes. The only negatives I can think of would be being able to perma buy guns but it has been a while since I played. Back before the current ranking system as well. Overall if you can find some buddies to play with it really ups the replayability of the game but it is always worth a few good laughs at any hour of the night.   Give it a try, you will enjoy it! 7/10 from myself.
9241	0	a	When i first played this back in 2012, i was using an 'All-in-one' touchscreen computer, and to say the least, the graphics were not that good (on my end), but here's my actual opinion  Pro's: - The combat alright to say the least when it comes to a cycle between a fps/rpg battle system, but it has it's merits for it's time. - with the current level of graphics i COULD muster, the game's visual was ok. - The npc/monster/enemy AI was mediocre at best, but that's common in most fps/rpg games.  Now for the Con's: - The explorability was ok, but unguided in it's purpose. - The story line was (IMO) uninteresting, and lacked that edge that captured the player's attention. - The enemies felt re-hashed in different areas of the game, and it was repetitous.  Decision?  Try the game, and see for yourself. if you feel it might be a predecessor to Borderlands; then you might be right. but i wouldn't reccommend buying the dlc for obvious reasons. I tried it out of a whim, and got bored of it shortly after playing a few hours.
942	1	a	I havent played this on steam but i did on the original website and i â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ loved it you can get gangs have fun arrest people if you play this you will get good memories of this game
2674	1	a	yes, this game looks really like gta. but its getting boring after a while! but you should get this game  its really cool
2382	1	a	THERE ARE LOG IN BUGS PLEASE FIX
4422	0	a	PAY TO WIN!
2921	1	a	A great Third-Person Shooter that allows for full character, car, symbol, and theme customization. That's basically the only positive aspect of APBR.  Negative aspects include a multitude of hackers and exploiters which cause for people to rage easily. The game also includes trolls which like to drive dump truck into your vehicles. Open world districts allow people not a part of your current mission to grief you with what's called 'Ghosting'.  The game is full of bannable offenses but the company, GamersFirst, does nothing about it since their ban policy is based on user input. Users need to record and report a user for a person to be banned.  If you have a weak control of emotions then I would suggest not playing this game.
10832	1	a	This game is excellant for killing time,not a great game to play if you rage easily,but still a fun game that I easily reccomend for gamers that know what their doing! :D
7585	0	a	mehhhh â¥â¥â¥ not really i dunno  is it good? nah could I GET INTO A SERVER? NO
3364	1	a	Very Addicting funny game. Nice for playing with friends. I recomend it to everyone (of coure above 18). 
5500	0	a	As of July 2015 APB Reloaded is dead or very close. Matchmaking is near impossible as there is nobody to play with, at least on the gold servers which is annoying, most everyone only hangs out in the neutral district now :(
4886	0	a	Pay to win. Ekh... Sure it's fun-- but completing missions is a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ with fighting all of the people who spent money on the game.
9771	1	a	didnt even know i had this but ill recommend it anyway seems prewtty down to earth
10249	1	a	Good Game and Good Gameplay I Reccomend This To People Who Like DayZ and Unturned
9756	1	a	Top notch old school MMO. Very detailed, and somewhat complicated. Definately not dumbed down like some of the newer games. This one has been around awhile, but is still well worth playing. The fighting is done in more of a FPS type. Heavy crafting, almost everything in the game can be crafted. It's set in a post apocalyptic wasteland, and you have mounts like motorcycles and cars. It can be time consuming, but is an excellent game and I recommend it to everyone. It can be truly played for free and has a good payment model.
8261	0	a	piece of crap
5053	0	a	It sucks
3138	1	a	nice game now with the anti hackor cheat system
2036	1	a	its has a good driveing as well as real life and you can get cooler looking &gt;:D
1821	1	a	A nice F2P and MMOTPS to play, check it out.
129	1	a	This game is awsome and people should play it for the folllowing reasons :  1 : Pure PvP makes you jump out of your seat and also breakes your mouse :'(  2 : awsome worled with a varity of places and varity of districts. 3 : cool graphiques and awsome sound tracks (not like GTA ) and the D audio is perfect. 4 : Your character, clothes, vehicles, and even your music may be customized to fit your playstyle. and about the bad things : 1 : Bad matchmaking puts you againest HARDCORE players . 2 : Lags even if u have a latancy of 40 ms.  3 : a game that will break your PC.
337	1	a	So much wasted potential, but still such a gem of a game. If you can get past the flaws it's an amazing game. The customization is unrivaled, character, clothing, cars, graffiti, and minor gun skinning. I personally enjoy the combat system. There are quite a few guns to choose from and each performs well within its niche, and the most of the 'pay to win' guns are re-skins of in-game unlockables.  System reqs:    You can play this game alright on a dual core with 4-6 gb of ram and a 1gb video card, but your experience will suffer greatly. My personal reccomendation: Quad code cpu 8gb ram 2gb or greater gpu 64 bit OS -my build for reference-    i5-3570k @ 4.5 ghz 8 Gb ddr3 @ 1866 Nvidia GTX 660 DCU II       I'm going to go ahead and insert my  tl;dr  here.  Good game overall. Small problem with hackers, free game.. (more than you know, less than you think). Customization makes this game a  must try .      Contd...  There are only two 'large' scale mission maps, they've been around since day one. Though it does get old, they really are great maps. Some mission locations can be one sided, but the overall feel of them is balanced. Now, on to the fight club maps. There are three total 'Fight Club' maps, with only two of them being active. Baylan Shipping and Storage is a small-mid size map with lots of high vantages and low cover. This map is great for any class, but is usually dominated by snipers. Asylum, it finally happened.. Asylum was originally supposed to be a kind of faction specific social district... long story. Asylum is technically still being developed for a yet to be released game-mode, but is an amazing indoors close-quarter to mid-range combat map. Then there's Beacon, the inactive map. Beacon was originally released with Baylan, but was temporarily de-activated in favor of Asylum. Nobody knows if or when it will come back, but it's mainly a close-quarters pointman map. Finally, there's Social District. Social is, as in many games, separate experience from the other districts. There are often many public conversations and arguments going on at once, some with roots going back to closed beta. Beyond that are the customization booths. There are booths for writing your own songs, writing your own death theme your vanquished opponent will hear, customizing symbols (for many purposes), vehicle customization (uses symbols), and character customization (can use symbols). There is also an in-game marketplace where players can sell their custom creations to others. That's as long-winded as I can handle tonight. Maybe one day I'll revise it.  
1504	1	a	I would recommend this game but can you pleae fix the god dang launcher its not working on steam i had to go all the way to go to extra time to go onto gamersfirst live again to get the proper launcher to play :/
9446	0	a	For some reason i cant play it, it lags and crashes when i press the TAB key to attack. So yeah,not happy about that.
3061	1	a	i cant download the game 
8930	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥.
629	1	a	Bought the retail version after a few hours of playtime, REALLY enjoy it, there's no PVE no stupid grinding, just pure GTA style action with some MMO elements, what's not to like ? :D
958	1	a	Action packed and thrilling! This game will keep you on your toes.
4201	0	a	this game sucks really - driving mechanics pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥ - you need to be admin to run it
2983	1	a	Cars, Guns, Newby P2W Newbs, All you could ask for in a F2P game.
10485	1	a	This is a sandbox game of sorts with the elements of games such as DayZ,Fallout and Rust.However,since it lacks the visual beauty of DayZ and the back story of games such as Nether and Fallout,it is not quite as popular as one might hope. The game still requires some tweeks here and there but with patience and some tlc,this game has extreme potential. The depth of crafting and exploring is truly unique along with the optional co-operation of other players. It's been quite awhile since I last played this game but I believe it deserves a second chance from those who shun it due to graphics and any slight game play bugs. All in all?Give it a chance.
8292	0	a	This game has good customization, and okay gameplay. it however has one of the worst communitys in gaming history, somewhere between ark and LoL. i tried one mission recently and it was easily greifed by a high level player that kept killing us. why can you even kill your own teammates during a mission vital for leveling up? thats just asking for trolls.  on top of that if you want anythign beyond the starter that isn't clothes, be prepared to dish out real money. and they're not cheap. and they're not permenent. so you pay $20 for a gun that only last 90 days at max, and the time costs extra. the guns you get from ingame currency are only 7 days max, so pretty much worthless.  the fact that a high and max level player can join a level 1 mission is also what ruins the game. imagine trying to win a mission thats supposed to be easy agenst a player with a rocketlauncher that one hits you. thats this game in a nutshell.
5535	0	a	The developers of this game are f*cking f*ggots and they deserve all the hate they get. They don't respect the community at all and they just want you to pay for their sh*t instead of maybe getting a small boost since the game should actually be enjoyable enough to do so, but the servers are slower than an alsimers patient trying to remember the faces of their children.
2884	1	a	This game...Too damn good; been playing only a week and cannot seem to stop. The community is mostly good, and the gameplay smooth and well put together. This is one of my only reviews on steam and for good reason, I don't consider myself fair enough to not be overcritical, download this game, its truly free with premium mostly involving looks and vehicles.
3739	1	a	It says the game is already running but the game is not running.How do I fix this issue?
9946	1	a	Amazing Roleplaying game with a TON of action, combat, and crafting involved. It's like minecraft meets skyrim then gets in a nuclear war.
1944	1	a	this game is a waste of your life. BUT..... it is a very good waste of your life when you get in to the game
2441	1	a	Strongly recommend this game.  Possibly the highest customization you'll ever see in a free PC game, ranging from character appearance to car appearance to weapon appearance. Strong and intense gun fights, strategic play, teamwork, open-world, you can have fun when you're not even in a mission, collect items, patterns for your customization, parts for your cars, new guns, make your own theme song for when you kill someone, maybe you want to dazzle them with your impressive skills or maybe just completely annoy someone by using an annoying tone such as the mario death theme or the trololol song. The horizons of this game are only known by your creativity and skill. You want to use a car as a ramp and jump out mid-air and blow your enemies up with a rocket launcher? You got it! You want to stun groups of enemies, arrest them and dance around them while they're left defenseless and waiting for the timer to run out so they can respawn? You got it! You want to joyride? Got it! Want to steal items and cars to make money from them? Got it! Are you a enforcer? You can't steal? Who says you can't? Ram a criminal's car into a store and those items are yours to pick up, unless you want the criminal to put them in his car first and then steal his car with the rest of his stolen items, you can turn them in for cash too, just like they can. Want to host a huge group and muck around in the social district? YOU CAN. Want to voice chat to your team and other people nearby? YOU CAN. You want to tag your customized graffiti on a billboard? YOU CAN. You want statues of yourself? HAVE THEM. Whether you want to be good or bad, or a mix of both, there's something in this game for everyone, except for maybe children and pregnant women, well maybe pregnant women are okay, idk, go into labour and let your kid's first words be 'Hey brudda' ~ Wilson LeBoyce.
3748	0	a	this game could have been the best online shooter of the 21st century.  but gamersfirst.
5399	0	a	yo, this game sucks.
4915	0	a	Cops 'n' Robbers... sounds great doesn't it. The concept that hearkens back to boyish childhood games. Yay!  But this... *sigh* I can't recommend, even if it is free.  Gameplay:   Yes, there is a wonderful range of customization to your player and vehicles, but dress up dolls does not make for a fun game.  The aiming controls are not precise, add that to nerfed down guns and distance shooting is always a roll of the dice unless you get right on top of your opponent and overkill... and even then you may not score.   The matching system is ridiculous. The three metal system of Bronze (noobs) Silver (noobs) &amp; Gold (usually P2W) causes countless whispered curses when paired up against a Gold opponent. Being repeatedly slaughtered is not 'fun'... except for the sadists that pay $25 for a digital super gun to do it.   Missions and Content are.... BORING. The game is built around one thing... GRINDING. It takes forever to max out the criminal boss you're pledged to, all for lackluster rewards... most of which can be obtained by criminals through smash &amp; grab looting and mugging. When on mission it's the same thing over and over... thin... VERY THIN... explanations on why you have to kill vigilantes and criminals. Simply put: It didn't make me enthused at all to be the bad guy.  More fun can be had by simply piling cars up and exploding them, and that's sad.  Where are criminal on criminal missions? Or enforcer on enforcer competitions? Hello? Massacres? The NPC pedestrians are barely treated like they exist.... why not missions with penalties and rewards for damages done to civilians? It has NO imagination. It's supposed to be blissful anarchy! Where's an evil super genius behind the scenes for some truly diabolical missions?!!!  Sound:   The gameplay aside... The sound is great.... and the soundtrack is good for discovering new unheard of bands. Too bad it doesn't have a constant rotation or a lineup of new bands to keep introducing tunes while preserving community favorites.  Community: Ahh... the community. The genuinely good humored players are overshadowed by whiners and griefers. Butt hurt noobs that whine about being killed or cheated a kill... and even more that countlessly accuse others of hacking just because they can't get over the idea that 1. The game cheats. and 2. They suck. Though hacking does happen, it's usually not the case over the general unbalanced nature of the game.  Overall: It's fun for a few hours each year, but eventually deleting the pointless maelstrom of discontent doesn't cause any feelings of loss.
7736	0	a	this game sucks, windows defender blocking .exe, u cant skip intro screen -&gt; making my brain explode because the volume is over 9000, after downloading it says wrong installation pls deinstall -&gt; i not even played this game but hell it sucks

3371	1	a	personally my on of my favorites
588	1	a	Its probably the best game i've ever played , but mainteance of the G1 is a serious issue and ruins it for everyone  However game is still playable and has about 1000-1500 players daily on Citadel (EU server)  I vote yes for game and no for G1
6995	0	a	Horrible game and company dont waste your money...both me and a friend got banned for absolutely no reason...we hadnt even PLAYED the game in over a year, suddenly we get on and their fairfight system bans us the second we log off? thats cool.  I spent like 3-400$ on this game, never playing their games again.  Email them try to follow up, and they basically say 'that sucks'  Started playing the game(looking over emails here), on 11/2/2012, never made it out of silver, never got any crazy stats with any of my weapons, i was better with some that others obviously but eh.  Then after almost 2 years of completely ON AND OFF play(mainly BECAUSE of hackers running around in the game), my friend gets on tells me about the fairfight system, and how he has not seen any hackers since, i get excited i hop on, play literally 1 mission log off and boom.

Screen: BenQ 27' 3D LED XL2720Z (1920x1080, 144Hz, 1ms, 12m:1, VGA/DVI/2xHDMI/DP) AMD FX (tm)-8350 Eight-Core Processor (8 CPUs), -4.0GHz NVIDIA GeForce GTX 770 (4gb Memory) 24576MB Memory  MINI REVIEW â APB Reloaded  The Good âºTons of character/weapon/car/clothes/midi customising/modding âºVery fast group system, just to push K âºeasy to unlock weapons, just pledge to one dealer and you on to it.. âºthe stuff you unlock ingame like weapons/cars/mods aint to expensive so you can buy and try them out for a period of time, and you learn Skills with weapons after using then wich also leads to unlock of newer weapons. âºIt have a nice tutorial pushing you through most of what the game has to offer :) âºoffers ton of fun with friends, once you get the hang of the guns and dont get insane â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ by ppl saying 'hack this and hack that'  The Bad â¹It can have a stuttering lag now and then, its like the game runs smooth just in missions or pvp that one time lag can lead to a quick death, but its not to often visible thank god. â¹You can pay for elite weapons with alot of nice mods installed on them for real cash, same goes for cool cars, way better than f2p part if you aint using alot ALOT of time to unlock everything. â¹A pvp grindfest and it can get old fast if you aint loving that :), cause the main mission is often attack or defend typish..  â¹No first person view for sniper mode, hehe not bad just really want to se that in the game. â¹Very expensive shop, and it can get alittle confusing how to manouver as a new player!  Worth Noting The game itself is easy to master and to understand, you will be put straight into a brutal battle, either you decide to rob shops as a criminal or mission with other players ;).  May-Aug 2015 Roadmap (they are somewhat alittle after on some parts still): â¢Completion of all EU District Server Upgrades (NOW LIVE!) â¢Joker Mystery Box 17: Urban Legends (NOW LIVE!) â¢EU PC Server Merge â¢US PC Server Merge â¢Espacio Season Pass â¢Refer-A-Friend â¢CRISP: Community Moderation System â¢New Matchmaking Release â¢PC Engine Upgrade Release â¢PS4 Launch and Xbox One Launch   The Verdict: This game has alot to offer for both f2p players and the VIP cash boys, if you look for a casual/semi active  game this might just be it, that said you are loving the GTA style gameplay.. Chat can somewhat be alittle harse with players mostly crying/â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ing over hackers etc. im sure there are some out there i have not seen any yet!  this game has improved alot since the old 2011 APB, but sadly if your looking for alot of changes they have not given any difference game missions just 2 pvp modes mostly..   I have had alot of fun playing it with friends, and it pushes my heartrate up when trying to reach checkpoint after checkpoint.

4024	0	a	I like this game, don't get me wrong. It's fun and fast, very customizable and good to play in groups.   The biggest problem with this game, however, is the playerbase. You will be hard pressed to find a more venemous and hateful crowd of online personalities anywhere else. Frequent 'hackusations' and minors screaming over the VOIP service. Griefers and exploiters are also abound, this game brings out the 'do anything to win' in a lot of people.   There is also a form of racism in the game against anyone who is not a gold leve player, and then in the reverse, anyone who IS a gold player. This game is also plauged by a group of people who were probably banned for cheating or something, that come back to crash the servers and generally cause everyone else to be unable to play the game.   This game has a very steep learning curve, but once you get it, you spend a lot less time getting â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ at your pixels and more time having fun... but not a lot more.
9597	1	a	if you can handle the PS2 era graphics and the odd lack of people, you will probibly enjoy this Fallout MMO. its definitly a better RPG then fallout 4 is .
2747	1	a	This game has addictable gamplay but also it's poorly optimized ( Laggs,fps problems)
5987	0	a	Bad company. 1- Many bugs in-game 1- bad community 1-
5529	0	a	ILL WAIT MORE ON LOADING SCREEN THAT I WILL LAST PLAYING THIS GAME
3855	0	a	A shadow of its former self.
8714	0	a	I've been playing this game for 227.7 hours in total. I honestly have mixed opinions about the game. I haven't played it for 6 months, but I can tell you everything about it.  What I really loved about the game itself was:  - The customization features - The cars, weapons, and clothing  - Cooperative players (If you have friends)  But here, are reasons why this game came into a disappointment:  - Bad shooting mechanics - Bad gaming optimization - Laggy servers - Noxious community among players (Hackers, idiots, aimbots, cheaters, etc.) - Unbalanced matchmaking - Misleading tutorials - Too much microtransactions - Greedy developers  What I overall think about the game itself is that it's cool in its own way, but it's not a game that you'll like to play very often. I would recommend this game, but not at the same time. You're free to try it for yourself if you like, but be cautious of what you're gonna face in the game.   In the end, I'll give this game a rating of 5/10.
2678	1	a	It's pretty good. There's no harm in getting it, so if you're curious try it out.  However, be wary of snipers.
2175	1	a	Unbelievable....  1. The graphics are Good, You can customize your cars and characters.  2. The gameplay is Super EPIC! You can choose Terrorist or Cops!  3. The FINAL... Its not just singleplayer missions and coop. Theres even PVP Missions!   THIS IS EPIC!! You should have this...
9217	0	a	servers down everyday 2-5 hour maintenance everyday still the same bugs and glitches since 2009 the falling damage is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing stupid, i jumped off a roof and landed on another building beside which was only 1 or 2 foot smaller and it took most of my health away been the same since 2009 dunno why they cut half of the starting areas most of them were good restrict everything down to the stupid queue time were you have to spend money to permamently raise it aswell as character slots(how stingy)
5808	0	a	'Oh man this game looks awso-' Got headshoted in the head by a sniper. *respawns* 'Alright! let's g-' gets a pellets from a shotgun in the back. *respawns* 'Just give me a mome-' gets blown up by a rocket launcher. *respawns* 'What the fu-' Gets ran over. *respawns*  'Ok â¥â¥â¥â¥ this gam-' Gets banned. Morale of the story: Just give up. Besides music and customizations, this game doesn't hold anything intersting. And though it seems like I don't know anything about this game in my 16 hours of gameplay, I have another 200+ gameplay hours from an older account that I played it back in 2013, and trust me, this game almost hasn't changed a bit since.
1780	1	a	Great game if your a fan of GTA series.
2134	1	a	You know, as much as I rage at this game, I find myself coming back to it time and time again. For one reason, it's addictive, you might have a bad day, not win a single damn mission, but, when you finally do, it's a feeling so damn sattisfying that you can't help but cheer. If you're a fan of third person shooters and Online play with against and with other players, this is deffinatly a game I would recomend. Another reason as to why I enjoy this game so much is due to the sheer ammount of custimization possible. Especially with premium. With premium membership, you can place up to fifty. Yes, 50 different designs on a peice of clothing, not to mention tattoos, hairstyls, a full face custimzation with pleanty of sliders to play around with to get it just right. Try it, you just might like it.
8264	0	a	Can't even start the game,please fix this problem.
1302	1	a	I saw the reviews, I've played the game for quite a while now, And yes, I am still a silver, But the community isn't that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. The â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥iest thing that I saw was someone typing 'OMG NOOBS' in the chat once when we lost, but that's it..  Also, yes, the game IS P2W, but I didn't pay a single penny and I'm doing just as fine and enjoying the game.   This game is definitely a fun game, And you can enjoy playing this easily, even if it is P2W.   -The almighty Paban.
5104	0	a	Booty Game It Sucks P2W TO THE MAX Bad Mechanics U New U Suck thats life in this game 
4058	0	a	Alright.  So, in a world where GTA V/GTA Online had not yet existed, Realtime Worlds (the creator of, among other things, Crackdown) decided to break the bank on an MMOFPS called All Points Bulletin, or APB.  It was a highly ambitious but deeply flawed experiment in open-world GTA-esque sandbox gamplay in multiplayer. There were a number of serious flaws to the game's design, implementation and operation that gave it pretty lousy reviews, and in the end it was one of the reasons why Realtime Worlds went into bankruptcy.  After this escapade, a holding company bought out the rights to IP ownership and services administration of APB, which would eventually become known as GamersFirst (a highly ironic title for a game company that seemingly throws everything they can get their hands on into a pay-to-win woodchipper as soon as possible).  These guys seemingly haven't done a whole lot else with the game besides random bugfixes that in the end might have made it impossible to play on my computer, either through the retail launcher or via Steam.  But when I WAS able to play it, there was a nugget of intrique buried in a pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ issues that prevented me from enjoying the game as a new player. The anti-cheat system was terrible, allowing for way too many impossible snipe-shots from other players in free-roaming or in missions, the community was pretty awful except for those who often hung out in the social servers (thus giving me an opportunity to entertain them by dancing like an idiot a few times, what MMOFPS fun) and player advancement was really meager as a result of how stratified the playerbase's levels of experience were.  To be fair though, there are some positives. The character/vehicle customization engine was mind-blowing at the time and is still pretty impressive today. If you can get together with people you know, you might enjoy causing havoc knowing that police dispatching is wholly reliant on the number of Enforcer players on the server and vice versa -- in other words, the world swings from one extreme to the other, chaos or dystopian order. It's pretty entertaining in that regard, I guess, although it's just a side effect of how unbalanced the game is.   Lastly, the missions I could get into were pretty entertaining in the world provided -- one of my favorite things about Realtime Worlds' open world games was the environment they designed for them. I don't exactly know why I enjoyed them, as they could be rather generic at times, but they always felt alive to me for some reason.   Maybe if a whole lot was changed about the game I'd consider going back to it (once I could ACTUALLY go back to it, as well) but in the meantime I'd not recommend this mediocre excuse for a massively multiplayer GTA. Now that GTA Online's out for PC, I'd suggest you check that out instead, its flaws are much more forgivable. It's weird that I can actually say that and mean it.
10577	0	a	Well, this game has definately got a case of 'Money Grubbing Developer Syndrome,' Doc. I never really played it that much, because I didn't have much fun at all. Practically everything half-decent in this game makes you do one of two things: Get stupidly good with your default class and get tons of gold, or pay stupid amounts of money. I mean, even F***ING PETS COST REAL MONEY! F***ING PETS!
8297	0	a	Hungry â¥â¥â¥â¥ing devs and wasted my â¥â¥â¥â¥ing money.  1, This game just wasted my money.I regret playing this game. u messed up and then u need to create a new account and play again and over and over again.  2.â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Graphics Even with Max Settings.  3.No F2P servers.  4.2op players is so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing unfair.  5.uninstalling the game is so good.  6.made me break my computer.  7.i rate this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥/  1/10 would â¥â¥â¥â¥ing uninstall this game again.  
10403	1	a	Lots of similarities to WOW. Games is F2P, but if you buy a subscription you can craft items faster and you can buy stuff from their site. Apparently you also get points to use every month even if you never pay.  Game has an interesting story line, post-apocalyptic, with a very large map. Community and clans seem very nice and I was invited to join a clan quite early and even when clan players aren't available there are enough people playing that you can temporarily team up with someone to finish a quest.  Crafting list is immense with 9 or 10 categories and loads of items in each category.  Melee &amp; ranged combat pretty balanced.  Definietly having fun so far.
9286	0	a	welcome 2 update simulator. so first lets update. 2 hours later (in-game time doesn't work propperly) let's start. i was very excited and then it happend. error..... so let's try again. error again. so don't waste your time.
4611	0	a	So, where to begin with this game.  The gameplay is good, that's all i'll say about that. What's wrong with this game?  - The Community  - Pay2Win  - The constant fps drop every minute or two  This has to be the worst online community i've ever seen. If you want to play with a bunch of spoiled kids who insult you because you didn't have your 'mommy' buy you in game skins and overpriced/powered weapons and don't play good when you've just started and go into a level matched mode, have fun.  Everything else, yeah, you already know. No need for me to explain.
2648	1	a	This game is very fun! You can do many things and it has that one thing GTA 5 dosen't have a Cops and Robbers mode and this game is entirely based on Cops and Robbers. Each has there own Vehicles and Weapons very fun and i really recommend this game mostly for Roleplayers or Cop Lovers!
620	1	a	Love this game very much! No words can explain &lt;3
623	1	a	one of the best games ive ever played but this small community has a big chance to encounter â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s and 99% trying to be cool with like 20k gametime mlg pro nolife or speedhack and aimbot and all of theese fat virgin â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ who will die alone without friends and family destroy the fun of the game the best thing will be that you will never chat with this fgts cuz from over 1000people i see there i just found 4 normal persons and i like them very much ^_^ sad but true :D and for the negative guys who dislike everything i am gold rank and i am the most time mvp without hack l2p mad â¥â¥â¥â¥
6566	0	a	It is a great game however, they need more free features in the game. Technically the game is pay to win, thats why I did not enjoy playing it :(
2169	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game
1061	1	a	:) 
5932	0	a	Best part is when you are going to click the uninstall button!
191	1	a	This is one of the most fun games i have ever played!   But. This can get really annoying with all the hackers and players that are on the wrong server (Gold on Bronze and Silver). 
1993	1	a	it's kinda gta for free, but not as good
2745	1	a	Yes very cool game!play lot of time!
10164	1	a	this is a good action and aventure game for people who like killing stealing and dieing
2230	1	a	nice game buy i dont know how to buy colision? ! â¢ 
897	1	a	Good game, wouldn't call it awesome though, if you like shooting the crap out of people, but it's pretty laggy/â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
4007	0	a	This game is cancer.
8228	0	a	Do not play, trying to open the game will literally open a tab in your browser asking for you to like their Facebook page and redeem a code
1831	1	a	Did you like cops vs. robbers as a kid? Do you like games where there's no well-defined 'good' guy? Do you like the GTA games? Do you like Saints Row games? (no air or water vehicles, and no motorcycles) Do you like semi-controlled world PvP? Do you like team play? Do you like team battlefields? Do you like weapons, vehicle, and character customization? Do you like skulking around solo causing mischief? Do you like ramming into unsuspecting vehicles with a dump truck and watching them expand into a cloud of incandescent vapor?  APB may have what you're looking for. ^.^
6792	0	a	This game is the drunken asian Grand Theft Auto. (No racism intended). The tutorial gives you a nice feel for the game, which is good, i liked that, but the game itself has a large delay, driving is near broken, and the graphics, arent all that great at all. I mean hey its played by lots of people, but personally this is just a waste of time.
8062	0	a	The definition of Pay 2 Win.
2568	1	a	awesome fun.Lots of players andd missions.customizing is amazing
347	1	a	I couldn't wait to play this game, but once I downloaded it and installed it I would run it anndddddd It would freeze... I would ley it load.. And Load.... And load..... AND LOAD..... Still nothing.... It says I have about 72 hours on game but I think it glitched out something... Trying to reinstall it to see if it makes a difference. If it does I will change my review!  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~EDIT~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I finally got around to building a 64 bit machine, so! I found the game CAN Work properly with a couple of tweeks!  Pros: Very fun, good storyline, lots of things to do in the multiplayer, free. Cons: Lots of hackers online, Lag issues, Nothing else more... I really enjoy this game, now.
5598	0	a	It says I have 4 hours, but that is not the case. Those 4 hours are from the game not opening properly. I have not had a chance to see any actual gameplay, but from my experience with the game as far as I had gotten, I wasn't going to continue. Many people have complained about the dev, and I kinda agree! Don't play this.
10546	0	a	Don't waste your time, any fun this game had months prior to coming on steam was very methodically removed by the devs. The very over inflated cash shop prices help drive the point home that this will never become anything awesome either, just a vessel for cash scam.  The original concept of the game was a simplistic fun game that allowed large groups of people to collaborate into an army to eventually topple the mad god. People would band together in very large groups to help level each other and take down bosses. A fun concept but due to the simplistic nature of the game, hardly something you want to dole out money for, especially considering the game is built largely from graphics that are open source. Cash shop perks however created the rise of the 'cashing loner' who could do alone what 50 or so players could accomplish. That also created these loners to corner anyone getting good equipment, creating a large rift in the player base, this essentially leads to 3 options in the game: 1) hack your way to the gear. 2) be forced to cash. 3) spend ages fighting for any progression.  Now these 3 routes are actually pretty typical of a free to play. Except Mad god has one more aspect that makes the taste even more sour, permadeath. Again with original concept of the game, permadeath wasn't so bad. The game was very pick up and play again, you didn't mind starting over because you never really had a lot of content to chew through so you never got too invested into any one character and there was other classes to try the game over from a new perspective. Now there is a lot more content to the game so dying for a free player even if they do as much planning as humanly possible, is a major setback, cash players can buy additional storage and even have soul bound items so they aren't exactly starting over every single time, adding to the gap between the players.  In all this game was a fun concept that was bled dry for every cent they could get and it shows plain as day.
7276	0	a	-Weapon balance is â¥â¥â¥â¥  -MatchMaking is â¥â¥â¥â¥  those two points ruins the entire game.
3390	1	a	i drove a car once or twice
3271	1	a	Everyone has to try this game and experience what F2P GTA is like
10230	0	a	Was not fond of it 30 seconds in. Did not even give it a chance, looked like poor mans fallout. HUD way too cluttered right at the start.
10349	0	a	horable game devs worked none on this game pray that this game gets taken off steam
10758	1	a	This game is a fun to play game with tones of customization . Many people may quit the game from frustration after dieing. That is half the fun though is building your way back up to the top. I love this game and I am certin you will too.
1804	1	a	11/10-ign 2 little freddys 2 mennu hekers -spooderman   You should play this game. One of the best F2PTPS(Free2PlayThirdPersonShooter) 
3262	1	a	why is the gun play still so bad in this game, no such thing as accuracy at any distance and no patern at all. The best example being, assult rifle at close range kills full health enemy instant even when they have a high power shotty and fired first, the next day same senario but at a distance with shotty killing enemy with full health out side of shotty range. Love the rest of the game but the gun play is maddening at best with its lack of consistency...... i recommend only based on customization only.
1921	1	a	Amazing game!! A must play for pc gamers.
8309	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥
1069	1	a	This game is cool guys
7729	0	a	Pay2Win in every sense of the word, I can't really recommend it for anything besides playing with close friends.  Amazing customization though, so if you're into that, you might still get some fun out of it.
5980	0	a	i can't play it it just loading at the desktop
2554	1	a	come try this game out with me! my name in game= Mimistacy (enforcer) its not that populair but a bunch of ppl still play it! super fun game and rek ppl on and also costume ur own cool car/costumes (see my screenshots of APB)  HAVE FUN xxx
2215	1	a	Brilliant online MMO and completely free! Easy to lose hours at a time.
1312	1	a	This Game Is Awesome
5606	0	a	Great game if you like getting killed over and over by the monsterous waves of â¥â¥â¥â¥ing grenade launchers, Sniper smg's, or the nuking lock on timed grenades so ya 10/10 â¥â¥â¥â¥ nuggets
8154	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥in sucks 
341	1	a	Get this game
2695	1	a	very real.....good game 
5167	0	a	When you first start the game very hard. Even mid-hard. Once under stress and, it will be BIow. Bye ~ bye ~ bye ~.
6370	0	a	This game had protential but it did not come through.
4664	0	a	Not cool.. Why? Never could play on that game and have fun on it... (sadly) Never could make a chracter I like will looks like.. Never works= always crashed..  Never like it Thought - its copy of GTA.. I not like it Saw the multi not liked it thogut ..  Annd my score is 3/10..
9984	1	a	It's pretty good both gameplay wise and story wise. It only gets better with friends and even better the farther you get, and as you explore the world of Fallen Earth.
10045	0	a	It's an ok game but it gets boring and repetitive quite quickly :/
9333	0	a	I had several problems with this game the first being the graphics. The graphics were so bad that I had to use a graphics card and turn the settings all the way up just to be able to see anything other than my charcter. The second problem I had was with the controls they are a little odd because you have to change between 1st and 3rd person constantly. 3rd person for movement and everything else, and 1st person for using your weapon. The final problem I had was driving the vehicles, the first time I drove I barely bumbed a wall in what I think was an atv exploded and killed me.   I wouldnt recommend this game but it is free so why not.
6334	0	a	confusing, laggy and pretty much dead
1263	1	a	I will recommend to all my friends
1038	1	a	My only advice to the people who wants to play this game is dont play it alone because when you are alone its really boring and lots of trolls will destroy your game experience.
7300	0	a	What the â¥â¥â¥â¥ is wrong with this game?!?!?!? When I get into a district, it takes years to load. Then I try to get out from the buliding, but the game has no response. And finally, when i find some car to steal, the game crashes. Everytime when I play it runs out of memory, and it still says on Steam that I am playing.  I won't play this game again.
7454	0	a	Really, really boring. repetitive. and above all, just annoying.
148	1	a	MEDIOCRE GAME BUT IT GIVES YOU FREEDOM WHICH CAUSES ANARCHY â¥â¥â¥â¥ THE POLICE. 6.66/10
6382	0	a	Planetside 2 runs better than this.  That's saying something.
985	1	a	okay, so, i dont have many hours but i will say this, it is a hit or miss game with the public so here is a list of pros and cons as of 2/23/2016 pros: the community is alot better now that bans have been handed down over waves and such, the graphics are great for a free to play and game play is simple to learn but hard to master considerably less hackers, still out there, but i see at least five banned every day by this new system 'fair fight' awsome custom jobs and such, and amazing artwork in and out of game, and awsome player made clothing and charectars to boot, (yes, even enforcers love the way some crims stylise  now that the pros are over, he are some cons  1. hackers, still, not as much, but still there 2. PAY TO WIN, gamers first prides themselves on allowing people to have a amazing fun time, even when your loosing, but 'why is this a con?' i hear you ask? because gamers first, like any other company, like jagex and blizzard, loooooooooooooooooooooooooove money, gamers first is just a bit more open about it, they cater to the rich with awsome cars and weapons, that to have them permantly, you have to pay around 20-30$ usd to buy, and in this game, they almost force you to buy them with irl cash, which brings me onto number 3. 3. expiring weapons, after 7-10 days, your weapon you bought from your contacts is unusable, no reason why, just it, if you ever wanna have a good perm gun, your gonna need to fork over some cash. 4. community moderation, No, i dont mean 'oh admin where are you, this guy is hacking' moderation, i mean fourm moderation, gamers first doesnt really have that great of a customer service really, just a few copy and pasted anwsers most of the time, but hell, most game comapny's do this,  so, in the end, my rating would be. 7/10
1119	1	a	I love this game, It's addicting and fun, and I met alot of awesome people because of it.
1057	1	a	Nice game! if you like to edit your own character, This game is for you
6904	0	a	i play this game often but its fun, but there is one major thing i dont like in a PVP F2play. ITS A â¥â¥â¥â¥ING PAY TO WIN. There is no form of pve(maybe a bit for crims so mug and steal) like there is nothing to fight when you aren't in machmaking. (oh and before i forget SPEND 1,000+ DOLLORS TO INJOY THIS GAME IN PVP). The matching in this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ gold like to farm kills in new and bronze lvl sever(G1 fix that) most thing in arms is over priced and OP(i TRIED some) there is also lots of grinding for f2p players. And let me not forget. I HAVE NEVER SEEN SO MANY â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ IN ONE VIDEO GAME AT A TIME ITS SAD ALL THEY DO IS TALK â¥â¥â¥â¥ AND GO AFTER NOOBS. AND THEN INSULT YOU ITS SAD. Oh and dont get me started on bountys. &gt;_&gt; thats all i gotta say(wen you have a bounty no one can help you now kiddys .-.)  Now some good things(the few reasons i keep playing this game BUT havent spent a peny on it). The costumisation(it also has cons on to it). It is nice the fact you get to costimize your character BUT for F2P platers its limmited.   THE CARS(I LOVE MY CAR &lt;3) cars they have nice cars in game when you unlock them. (as a crim) MUGGING AND STEALING-FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN, BUT hold up there are some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥(if the car isnt owned by you) who will take from that car you stole and stored stuff in. They can also blow it up even if its yours or not. NOW FOR A LIST OF MORE CONS IN GAMEPLAY #1-Hit box-delay #2-aiming-SHOOT INTO THE WALL WILL YAH #3Cover-DONT HIDE FROM A SNIPER BEHIND A CAR they can still get ya #4-Pay 2 Win- OP guns in arms anot enough good ones in game #5-SSSPAWNING(more in fight club) GET READ TO BE STAWN KILLED #5-The matchmaking- unfair matchup (one team new players other golds). #6(im not to sure on this one) HHHHHHHHAAAAAAAXXXXXXX-from what ive heard that is. although ive seen some imposible stuff(no not like 360 noscope like in cod like shooting through walls always knowing where you are aimbot(i think)).  Over all I would recomend it but it has alot to fix, so its up to you if you wanna play it. And plz try to have fun dont take anything sereusly mainly because its a game.   (i just want car parts new clothes and drive around fancy looking is that to much to ask in a game).   (i am sorry for my spelling)   5/10

6631	0	a	I really wanted to like this game. I really did. The customization is amazing, more games need to have this type of personalization. And that's the only good thing about it. The game itself barely works, controls are awful, the community is horrible (you get called a n00b by others when you ask politely for help and their best advice is to 'git gud â¥â¥â¥ lel'), glitches everywhere. I'm going to quote another reviewer because everyone else has pretty much summed it up: 'Complete garbage and full of hackers of all kinds.'
8328	0	a	You CAN have some fun while playing with friends, but as of 2015 it's waaay better to just get yourself GTA V and play Online with your buddies
4871	0	a	The launching page took me to a link to like them on facebook and it isn't even working. I was so excited...
8356	0	a	cuz the â¥â¥â¥â¥ wont play cuz i dont have the right graphics card so yea peace of shir steam ur a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing shity gaaming think i made i wait three hours for the â¥â¥â¥â¥ to download then it wont â¥â¥â¥â¥ing play so im gald it was free cuz i would br getting my money back
4980	0	a	Good game. Too bad the pay-for-guns part is giving an overhand and makes the game less fun to play.
1895	1	a	Absolutely addicting! A must have game or at least a must try! If you are into the Grand Theft Auto series or the cops and robbers genre? Then, APB Reloaded will keep you busy for hours on end! Lots to do and complete character customization. Leveling up your gun role progression is what makes this game one of a kind!!!! Very unique and original MMO 3rd person shooting game!   aka Badnuz (Colby)

3139	1	a	ok if GTA met pc for free here it is you get to choose either crinimal or enforcer thats up to you the game is good but lag issues are a major issue
7735	0	a	I thought to myself why not to try it since it's free to play. However I was quite disappointed. The best part is sadly the character editor. 3/10
2981	1	a	This game still exists?
3213	1	a	I get in game do a mission and get rekt by kits that paid for guns that are better using their moms credit card. 10/10 would get rekt again
8840	0	a	Updated Review 2016 - The bloom in this game is awful, picture this...fingerprints all over your phone screen and then smudged. That is what you can expect to see while playing this game. Now once you get past the dated graphics the actual core of the game is fun..provided you don't mind PVP. Tons of customization options to your character and your items. Sadly the Armas Market (real currency required to purchase vehicle body kits, guns, weapon skins etc..) is very pricey. The real bad part is the insane amount of cheaters since this is a free to play game...you can expect to come across them daily and just about every other match. The anti cheat detection system is fairfight and some in-house countermeasures....all of which puts its fair share of catching and banning them on a daily basis. SO dated graphics, gnarly amount of cheaters, expensive market place...and a toxic community are what you can expect here..oh and I shouldn't forget this game's developer has an uncanny knack for UNBANNING hackers/cheaters which really should deter you from investing any amount of time and money into this game.    Old Review 2014 - The most expensive FREE to Play ingame items.

5906	0	a	This is a game where cash is king, and not in game cash, I mean real cash, I dont want to spend big bucks for better weaponry and cars, this game would be good if it wasnt this way and the dlc was less pricey more guns were available ingame,same with cars, and a easy to understand tutorial too
81	1	a	nice game good graphics its gta mmo
5416	0	a	dont spend time on that game. full of hackers. anti cheat ban you when you get over 50 reports. this game fall into a wrong hands (GamersFirst)
9717	0	a	Game is horrible, not much more needs to be said
6547	0	a	For now im going for not recommended because the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game forces you to create a profile on another site WHERE !!! You cant even â¥â¥â¥â¥ing register !!!!!! So i havent even got to the stupid game :((((
4545	0	a	Pay to win.   I mean, nothing more to say. All 'New' players are re-rolls, and are hardcores so they know everything about everything, and make sure that true 'new players' know that they are far more apt to everything the game has to offer.  This being said, I played this long before it was a steam thing, and used to be very good at it as well, but it lost its glory when it became pay to win.   3/10 - 'I'm a noob and know it' Simulator
1573	1	a	This is a amazing game. i would recommend this game to anyone who likes Gta 5 or wants a experience like Gta if they cant afford it.  Keep up the good work.
3789	0	a	You don't want to play this game. I had typed out a long review, but Steam decided to discard it, so let me summarize:  Bad matchmaker. Low level players instantly against high level ones, over and over again, and level makes a difference in this game, both in skill and gear. Buggy gameplay, with bad shooting mechanics based around spread AND recoil, with few guns being able to perform more than one singular task. Horrible players who alternate between hacking, griefing, and acting like total tools to the rest of the community. And a game company managing it who doesn't know what the word manage means. Literally has let the game get worse and lag more and more over the past year and a half. If you must play this game, do not pay for anything, there is no reason to, and it's just as likely the game will die in the next year, flushing your money down the drain.

436	1	a	a very nice game, and you can collect and group conflict.
7540	0	a	APB... APB its, its amazeing! The customization, The Detail. It had me playing it for hours. To the point where I wouldnt even know the sun has passed and the day was over. Though the community can be harsh. Thats not so bad. All the guns are ballenced, So i thought.  All the guns you get (In-Game with out paying) are ballenced, I am even talking about you annoying OSMAW, You are balenced as well. The thing is, Some guns in the 'ARMAS Market' Are just plain, stupid. I mean like the universal ATAC or the NANOS. Those wouldnt be so bad if it wasnt mixed in with the commonly known 'De-Threaters'. People who lose matches (So they may join bronze servers, Though they may be a gold threat rank) often ruin the fun time, Win or loss, i may be haveing with my friends. It is just a major killjoy when a bronze comes in with a ATAC and NANO, His skills are just way beyond me or my friends. As they reck havoc on all the missions, till they hit gold. Just to dethreat back to bronze, to repeat the process.  Another problem is the rerolls, People who make new accounts so they wont have to 'De-Threat'. Rerolls are quite common. As the fact i am a R212 and a R009 will join and kick me and my teams butt... Alone. With no help. Not saying they hack, I know some ppl have VERY Good skills on games. It just makes it hard for me to return to such a beuitifull game. This legit  'One of a kind'  game. It saddens me about all the problem this game has.   Lastly my ending result for this game. Sadly would be to  AVOID IT . It is very fun, Very Addicting, Very... Frusterating, Screen punching frusterating. Unless you are a natural born shooter. Evrey one I have talked to agree, that g1 (The Game owners) only have this game running because it is a 'Legit' Money farm for them, All they do is care for the money. I mean look up the prices for your self. All and All this game would be a five of ten for me.  Thank you for reading this review on this wonderfull game. 
1398	1	a	Downloaded game, entered the city, got into a mission, I rekt a guy, guy accused me of hacker.   10/10 would Rekt him again.
10049	1	a	Ok so, where do I start? This game was a game I was very fond of (As my time spent playing it might show) and I've already written a review before but since it was kinda choppy I stepped upon it again and decided to add to it.  I've been playing this game for around 4 years back when I started around 2012 when I was also first introduced to steam, so along with downloading TF2 this game caught my eye as my love of post-apoc settings for games sparked my intrigue. Back then, this game just had so much to offer, to me in particular as I was fine with discovering most of it for myself with managing to obtain an ATV early on.   In terms of gameplay, the whole grinding aspect didn't really bother much as I was still managing to have fun cooperating with various people I would meet around placed like Embry (I think that was the name of the main S1 city?) and City where there was an event to protect a town made up by players from enemy mobs (Called Shivas If I'm correct) where you would see people showing off their cool gear and mounts.  The PvP aspect of the game was never really anything I tapped into, It just didnt really intrest me, but I'm sure theres some players out their who saw its potential.  To end this review of, no matter how bad it is, I guess this game is kinda dead with its peak being off in the earlier years where I made a few friends on my way to Lvl 55.  If anyone remembers me, my main characters name was Brad Carson, with other names like Pvt.Brad being another char of my mine, and to anyone who remembered me, It was a pleasure having played a fun game with you for quite a few years.   Sorry if this review was pretty bad, I'm just really getting over a lot.
2365	1	a	the game is good but the ranking system have to change but it is fun playing as both :) do get down and ply see ya in APB :)
1340	1	a	Its like a GTA but free

2690	1	a	apb is a really fun game it provides lots of customization and u can go out on the streets of san paro with friends and start doing missions or just fool around its up 2 u.
3756	0	a	Updated as of 26/08/2016: So as a game that I have known for over 5 years now, there are times where you feel like coming back just to see what's up, and see if anyone you once knew is still playing. Keep in mind I haven't quit this game, but more of retiring from it until futher notice.  Now I can agree with a large amount of new players who have just tried this game, yes there are a few hackers out there, it makes it fustrating and you never want to touch this game again unless they fix it. However you'll find some sort of cheater in any F2P game, whether it be an aimbot, they're abusing a glitch, wallhacks, invincibility, etc. I understand that with FairFight they're trying to push back the amount of hackers in the game, but with each new day that passes by, these people will find a way to try and bypass it and survive on this game a little longer, even if it means one extra hour of tormenting the playerbase, and once that character is banned, it's that easy for them to make a whole new account and start it all over again.  However I've put up with my fair share of hackers and all that crap over the past 5 years in this game, and while it does tend to annoy me, it's never gotten to me to the point I've uninstalled APB. I just put up with it and wait for the next mission. My problem with this game at the moment, is the lack of content recently. It's been over 2 years now since the last contacts were released, and basically everyone who is R255 either sits in social cause there's nothing to do, they make a brand new character and level that to 255, rinse-repeat, or just leave the game until something new comes up to bring them back for a short period. Some players have even asked for a new game-mode, such as turf wars or racing district, instead of picking between repeated missions with the same opp, or fight club.  But what do we get instead? Joker box after joker box with a new gun that tends to be useless compared to some of the original weapons, and then you decide to release another version of that JMB weapon for credits or by forcing your players to spend 100's of dollars just to get it as a loyalty reward. I get it, a free-to-play game needs to get it's revenue from somewhere, and for APB it's the marketplace, but to care more about another gamble box over actual content for players in action districts like a new contact? No wonder why everytime I get on the game looks dead as f**k.  It really dissapoints me, as I saw alot of potential in this game, but to see where it's landed itself now makes me wish I could pull the plug on it before it suffers any longer. So to anyone who's thinking about installing this game, as a veteran of this game, I suggest you hold back and wait, it's not worth the hard drive space as of this moment.
10861	1	a	 Cooleo
6726	0	a	from the 'less than an hour' i played of this game, it has way too many problems for me. first off, in installing the game, it takes forever to download on even my connection, and i have 35mb/s up AND down. once it finally downloads, and is playable, i get some sort of registry error.   at this point, i was able to get into the game, the login system is a little strange. after a few minutes playing the game i got kicked from the server by punkbuster after dying, and am unable to rejoin the game. message i got was 'restriction:service abnormality'  i was hoping to give this game a good review, lokked really cool, but cant do that if i cant even get into the damn game.
8286	0	a	if you seriously like this game there is something wrong with you lmao
4572	0	a	dont get it it yhas to downlaod punkbuster which nrver downloades
3817	0	a	Alone: 3/10 With friends: 7/10  Dont bother playing alone.   Grouping system sucks and the community is poor.
3507	1	a	.
9707	0	a	Not even worth downloading. Its impossible to play 5 minutes without it freezing up your computer. I even set a timer on it. It actually freezes after exactly 5 minutes of gameplay. Wierd.
417	1	a	If you want a Grand Theft Auto type game, GET APB RELOADED. This game has amazing missions as a police storyline or as a gangstar storyline. If you think the Cops are the 'goodie-goodie' type, you thought wrong. The Cops also have the capability to beat up citizens, so they are definitely not to be overlooked. The gangstar storyline is your classic gangstar with the girls (or guys depending on your gender), the theft, the beating up, mugging. Massively Multiplayer. Action. FREE 2 PLAY. Get it while it lasts.
10486	1	a	Amazing game just had to uninstall because was unable to get dlc content
4097	0	a	CrAP
4597	0	a	The game is a cheat fest at this point, and the developers do nothing about it. I wouldn't recommend playing it unless you're a revenge hacker.
2137	1	a	Pros! 1.) Open World 2.) Game Currency 3.) Missions 4.) Carnage  Cons! 1.) Long loading screen 2.) Not enough cars/ cost too much 3.) Not balanced teams
10748	1	a	Despite many reviews saying Kabam ruined the game, I have to say the game is quite fun. Paying in this game won't make you automatically win, you still have to have enough skill to survive, BUT paying for things such as extra character slots or extra storage space is super helpful. After playing this game, you feel inclined to purchase things, instead of forced to. You can easily have a fun experience without spending any money.
3284	1	a	this game is awsome
2677	1	a	i have a lot of fun while playing this game it is difficult but amazing 
8060	0	a	this game made me kill myself when i saw the lag
7648	0	a	this game keeps on crashing and hanging i do not recommend it
6946	0	a	The best part about this game is uninstalling it. &lt;3
6310	0	a	dont play this game
2285	1	a	i think i would like it but my laptop cant run it
3255	1	a	Not Recommended for people who don't understand that this is just a game.
9866	1	a	A good game but the grinding takes to long the game could have some better missions they get boring overtime .... 
1509	1	a	Super game. been hacking since day one.   Fun to hear kids cry.  Helios hack FTW !!!
3353	1	a	Great game can be Paid to win, but you dont really need to pay it just makes it less of a hassle. If there are no people on the server it goes to crap because your stuck running around collecting things or having to play vs a very high ranked player and he just camps you over and over. Mic is required or fast typing skills lots of communication. Servers are dead lately so might want to check it out before you spend any money.
7067	0	a	This game is incredebly glitchy and has issues around every corner. The game gives you misions to complete and once you have done so it just continues telling you to do it. When I first started it was ok but for the past 3 days I have been getting major game glitches and have not been able to succeed in doing anything the game wants me to because of it. The game also has severe network issues and is continuesly losing connection to servers even though my internet is just fine, quite annoying.
190	1	a	While not the best sandbox game around, APB Realoaded gives you a great online world for you to play in with your friends! The map list is a bit short at the moment but this can easily be fixed with updates. The Character creator also is very nice and has some depth to it, allowing you to make a really unique character. The microtransactions are a pain but they can easily be ignored. Weapons are also a pain as you can only buy them temporarily unless you spend real money but this also doesn't ruin gameplay, as the starting weapons are pretty good. Veichles also have a decent amount of customizeation, letting you put your own logos on and you alos use those same logos on your clothing or as tatoos!
4540	0	a	I personally would not recommend the game. This is because of the fact that the matchmaking system sucks since a lot of the veteran players like going up against new players since it's easy. Also the fact that people do hack and the devs seem to not care.
9959	1	a	Not a bad game, it is free to play so of course the better items cost money to buy. Just like the turbine games such as Lord of the Rings and Dungeons and Dragons. Other than that fault, the game is just about like any other MMO. This one has a Fallout taste to it being set in a post apocalypse world. The main down side is the crafting can take a lot of time to do unless you pay to remove the limit.
9795	1	a	apperently im allowed to post a review even though ive never played this.
9282	1	a	An interesting post-apocalyptic game. Usually when I think of post-apocalpytic games I think of a generic zombie shooter, so when I went into Fallen Earth, I was surprised (Granted there is a part of the main story where they kind of have zombies). Fallen Earth is a open world MMORPGFPS. It's alittle more hardpressed towards the survival aspect then the shooting aspect. Crafting is a big thing in Fallen Earth and is probably one of the funnest thing to do. Almost everything you can get, can be crafted. From weapons, armor, and even your ammo. Sure you can buy most of your items from the auction house, but there's a certain feeling of just crafting it yourself that is so amazing in the atomsphere that Fallen Earth has created. The combat is a twist between a FPS and a TPS. You can shoot in a third person camera view but I perfer playing in a first person view, Although it feels just a tad bit off and could use some work it's generally pretty good. Although not the most innovating or new, that's not really what Fallen Earth is about. In my opinion Fallen Earth is about the grander feeling of the atompshere of a Post-Apocalyptic world. Not saying anything about it being a hardcore role playing game but if you can get past the generic combat, it is quite an intriguing game. Theres plenty to do, and even from a story perspective, with all of the side quests and even the main quest is kind of interesting, it caters to a wide audience. If you're looking for an openworld MMO that focuses on elements other than combat, than look no further.
10888	1	a	Fun, but make sure you have good specs and internet or this'll lag like a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
7436	0	a	APB Reloaded is not a very good game for a few reasons.  One: driving. Driving in this game is a chore. The streets must be made of solid sheets of ice, because cars slide around on turns. They're very hard to control, especially for beginners.  Two: unfair advantages. This game features microtransactions, which, when done properly, are not a problem at all. APB does it wrong. The more expensive guns are clearly better than others, putting inexperienced players or those who don't want to spend money on this game at a severe disadvantage to those who do. There is also no skill match mechanic, meaning that new players have a chance at going up against top-level players much of the time. This quickly leads to much frustration at not being able to do anything. For the new player, the only way to advance is to get lucky, which is not a good first impression.  Three: the game constantly pushes these purchases on you. If I wanted to buy something from this game, I would visit the marketplace myself. You don't need to constantly remind me that something's on sale. If I cared enough, I would check the sales out myself.  Four: the gameplay itself. Gameplay is unbalanced and frustrating, leading to much confusion for the new player. Objectives are hard to find, and the instructions vague at best. Rest assured most of it involves killing.  There is only one possibly redeeming quality about this game, and that is that there are good customization options for your character. This is dragged down by the fact that to get these customization options, you need money, which is earned by either trudging through the impossible missions or buying currency.  All in all, this game is only playable if you're willing to spend hundreds of dollars on it, and even then, it's mediocre at best. This game left a bad taste in my mouth, and you can be sure I won't be coming back for another bite.
204	1	a	this game is good exepct some of the things i would change the auto balance should be improved bigos sometimes they are a bit sucky
10375	1	a	Positive: i absolutely love this game although i may not have much hours on it due to how busy i am, i still have some free time to play this game i love the graphics and i love how its not pushing you into doing things (in other words they are not forcing missions on you) i would recommend this game to anyone who loves medium paced games and games that you can basically do whatever you want. the only thing that i am not a big fan of is the price of gas for my atv, other than that this game is overall it is an okay game. Negative: although i may have a good review above i think i should put some negatives in the review. it has extreme lag even for my friend who happens to have great intenet and a beefy pc, the game needs to have seperate servers and it also needs to have a singleplayer added even if the servers cant be added due to money just add a singleplayer mode. i honestly think that the game needs to have a plot that actually goes somewhere, i may not have a ton of hours on it but i can tell by where i am at now the plot goes nowhere. i hate how people can interfere with your missions, it really sucks how i am doing a mission and soe other person can come up and kill everyone so i have to wait a while for them to respawn and have to basically restart. oh and on a recent mission i was not told how to use the weapon that they gave me so it took me 15 minutes to get someone to tell me how to use it and it was too late because i had 30 minutes to do the mission and i didnt finish it in time.  i would give this game a 5/10
5469	0	a	Corrupt devs make this once amazing game an utter nightmare for any players wanting to sink 40+ hours into it.
3713	1	a	It's great game about cops and criminals but need some huge update....
2423	1	a	I have just one question. How hard is it to make controller support? very shameful
10314	1	a	Best survival Free2play game on steam
8473	0	a	i might change my mind when i finally get it working. but for now it has been only annoying.
10842	1	a	This game is just great ! It's lots of fun to hunt down gods or to run dungeons with your friends :D I'm playing Realm of the mad God for 2 years now ( I think ) and I did some breaks for 1 or 2 months from RotMG, but after all, I came back and enjoyed it again and again. In the beginning it's pretty hard to stay alive and survive for longer than an hour, but when you played for some time and learned how the game works and how to farm stat potion's, the real fun beginns. But already in the begining I enjoyed the game, even though I really died a lot :D
9738	0	a	Its super buggy and a boring intro. I played for maybe 10 minutes and i couldn't play anymore. The worst of it was the visuals. I couldn't see my character like i made him, and most of the environment was transparent. I can see potential for this game if it was fixed up a lot
8492	0	a	APB Was A Fun Game Until Getting Into The Salty Horrifying Community... Just dont get the game.
8056	0	a	fun and unique game, but it became pay to win you will download it, try it and delete it eventually...
3896	0	a	3 words: Pay, To, Win
2875	1	a	Awesome game. It's like GTA Free to Play... Neverending customizable options for your Character/Car/Music. Run through the City, fight for/against the Law, Spread the safety/terror. Shoot, steal or complete the randomly generated missions. Run up your rank/Prestige, buy weapons, cars and upgrade them. Definitely worth a try. Only problem were cheaters.. but that's from the time it wasn't on Steam and like almost 1 year back, I wonder how they solved that problem.
6137	0	a	It's very pay to win in some aspects,but let me get the pros and cons sorted out here...  Pros: -It's fun at first when you're just goofin' around... -Kinda funny to look at glitchy vehicle system -Funnily bad in a lot of aspects such as Driving,Shooting,Threatening Civilians,Doing anything that leads to an 'animation' etc. -It's free (For the most part) Now onto what everyone wants to actually hear about...  Cons: -VERY pay to win -Lots of things in this 'open world' look very bland,lifeless,and boring. -Looks like a game from 2006-2007 -Has kinda bad optimization (even on a $1000 rig) -Bad hit boxes/hit detection -Pathetic AI -And much more i'm not willing to type :)
5092	0	a	It's a GTA clone without the charm of the characters, all the characters there is have the same bland 'bad boy/girl' theme to them, the voice acting can be pretty funny on some of them. Well, in my first hour of the game, i spawn in for the first time, guess my guns are ok, bullets come out one end so i can't really complain, then i get completely destroyed by somebody who payed hundreds of dollars on this game, fun fun fun! The customization this game boasts is soooo limited, unless you give the devs money, of course. Also, is it just me or is everyone with a female character dressed like a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥?, with all that customization i would figure you could at least be creative. The gameplay is kinda stiff, but not horrible, driving cars feels like your wheels are covered in vaseline and it handles horribly, bad driving in a game where you need to get around ruins it for me, but just throwing in the PTW and crappy starting gear complete's the package. I give it a 2/10, dont bother
5781	0	a	no no no no no no no no no after waiting for 2.5 hours for this joke to download then had to register to play it only to find out i have to download it again while its just finished downloading i will unistall after this full stop.
477	1	a	I played this game a lot everybody says that it is P2W but its not you can be better normal weapons,yeah the Premium thingy is a little bit P2W but you can solve it whit playing more highly recommding this game one of my favorite games (i didnt play on steam account thats why it only says 118 hrs on record)
7235	0	a	Can't even launch the game anymore. Tried every possible fix or workaround. Reinstalled 3 times.
2305	1	a	very fun game. the connection does get a litte ehhhh. but other than that its great. i hope that they put money into making the servers and connections to the game better. if you are reading this, hit download.......
9269	1	a	It lives up to the definition of mmofpsrpg. The presentation's a little rough, and the game elements are thrown in your face kind of suddenly at the start, but it all works. Graphics seem a little dated but not terrible. Shooting is good, custmization is good. Plenty of story to discover as well.
3330	1	a	Yea i REALLY like this great game
1720	1	a	This game is ok. I bought it back when Real Time Made it So Im still stuck on it as that time. I always hated game with a Weapon Rental system. That is the First thing gamers First Did to the game. This game Is Good if you like being mad cause It dont take long and it will put you there. There are unbalances and It has turned into more of a Pay to win type Game. So If you want to play for Pure Fun good luck and Dont get to upset.
9555	0	a	HEAVILY touched up 'Screenshots' mislead you. This game does not look half as pretty as they mislead you to believe.   It is a 6/10 average MMO
10853	1	a	This is a very simple game which involves lots of grinding, learning through death, and losing everything in your inventory when you die, so why is it such a good game? That feeling you get when you get the loot. When you see a white bag for your first time, or get a Blue bag from a hard boss, they are what keep everybody in this game. That indescribable feeling of overwhelming excitement and happiness has kept me into this game for a long time. It's a very relaxing game, very little competition, but tons of fun!
1549	1	a	This game ruined my life. I love it.
5174	0	a	full of cheaters
7160	0	a	MIDDLE EAST , ASIA , SE ASIA NO SERVERS .................... SO IT LAAAAAGGGSSS................... DAMN THIS LAG !!!  IT WOULD BE SUPERB IF THEY HAD STEAM SERVERS IT THESE PLACES  CAUSE THIS GAME IS REALLY NICE !!!
10407	1	a	Not too bad of a game.
4593	0	a	The devs are stupid, the players are stupid, the client is laggy, the servers are laggy, the game is buggy and everything else that isn't forementioned is stupid/laggy/buggy/broken (or a combination of those).
10135	1	a	This is definitly a niche game but if you like games that do not hand everything out to you and have a steep learning curve this game is for you. Barely any useful quest rewards, if you want something you have to go out farm for mats and craft the items yourself or pay someone else to do it. Beautiful graphics and fpslike gameplay seal the deal. Definitely not for everyone, but those who it is for it is a hidden gem.
3588	1	a	Car Smashing Griefing Simulator whichever year. Of course there is more than that to this game. You buy clothes, you buy cars, you buy guns and feel fabulous about yourself, but all that comes with real world money or countless hours spent in this game. Is it worth your time you ask? Well if smashing low tier cars into high tier super cars until they explode until you get reported is your cup of tea, by all means create a bald naked fat guy and go ram everyone in the street. Also cherish the time introducing your friends to the game and finding them as disappointed about the community as you are.
9432	0	a	Literally Only Played Because I Was Out Of Money Awful Story 0/10
9834	0	a	I did not get to play the game, since the game kept freezing about 10 seconds after my character started moving, I could stand in one spot for up to 5 minutes, which is the most amout of time I was willing to wait, and then the game would freeze after a few steps.  Hard to review a game that won't work properly.. and before anybody says anything, yes, I did try using the launcher fix tool, I went as far as uninstalling and downloading again.. just to be met by the same error.  So yes, it could be my computer, but then, I can play other games without them crashing every few seconds, so maybe it's not all on my side.
1775	1	a	Summary: In APB Reloaded you take on the role of a Criminal - hell-bent on causing havoc and making money, or an Enforcer - tapped by the city to keep order. The city never sleeps and the fight never ends in this fast paced Massively Multi-player, Action Shooter! 
5526	0	a	p2w not cool.
7921	0	a	so there i was, a criminal. an old man with gray hair, greased back, wearing a black business suit with black gloves (Iknowyouseemestylin), i just robbed a couple of stores in my big white windowless van, complete with the words 'free candy' sprayed on the sides, when i decided that i wanted to do some missions. so i hit the auto mission button and was thrust into one of those bring item A to area B missions. i get to the door i need to break open to get the item, when suddenly POP, i'm one shot buy a cop with a sniper rifle. i think nothing of it, and go on with my missioning, i start running back when i suddenly hear 'SHHVOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAA BOOOOOOOOOOOOM', i suddenly become tomato sauce and see the death cam, another cop! this one had a rocket launcher. now i'm starting to wonder, how did these 2 guys get such nice things, yet i only have a bloody starter machine gun and pistol. so the match ends (we lost completely), and i go to look for the weapons. none of the merchants I had access to had such nice boomsticks, then i noticed it, APB STORE. so i go onto the arma store and LO AND BEHOLD, Snipers and Rocket Launchers. a can buy PERMANANT guns from the apb store for real world cash. THAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATS RIGHT FOLKS, guns you buy ingame are 30 day guns, the permanant ones are either horrifically expensive, or cost irl cash (and are also expensive). who has 2 thumbs and won't be playing this game? nathan lane. I too will not play this game.
4199	0	a	First of all imma just let people know if you love customizing and making cool stuff in a video game then this may be the right game for you. If your competitive play then this game is not for you. APB has to be the most fustrating online third person shooter i have ever encountered. I literally sit here and rage day and night. The game comes with horrible lag right now hackers and any other and most of these hackers return for round 9 yep round 9 they are that determined.   APB's gun play is the most horrible i can say comparing it to csgo, csgo has to be the bomb atleast their gun play makes sense and there is some pattern and strategy to be used but for apb i would just say majority of the guns act very unrealistic and are very difficult to master and for some of them even though you master them they still â¥â¥â¥â¥ you up in alotta ways.  The armas maket place is where you spend real money for guns,cars,clothes,etc. As many have said gamers first should just call themselves money first and even i agree that the cash shop prices are super unreasonable making this game look like its for the rich and famous.   The community is extremely toxic thanks to hackers who aimbot silently and you average 4 year jerk off who will just make you feel like crap cause your not at their level. Their are alotta cheap ways players can win a game in apb for instance you will find urself getting to a final mission where you have to capture an item and the opposing team or your team will take the item and run away with it and you now have to chase them and depending on the type of vehicle/ mods/ level of the play you wont even stand a nose hair of a chance at reclaiming the item making this game obiously onesided, trust me you can litterally see when you should just stop trying sometimes.  This game is still gun but like i said its fustrating. I can see myself leaving this game pretty soon.
2225	1	a	Best thing to realize is that i cant play the damn thing because my account doesnt 'Work' and im stuck at the damn loading screen forever  10/10 Would play loading screen simulator again.
8676	0	a	You start out at a low level wandering the city with bad guns then u get rekt by everyone and thing out in that city cause you're level 1 and everyone else is level 5 million

8630	0	a	I'll probably get lynched for saying this, but there's nothing to do in this game. In addition to the lack of activity, the two main elements of the game - driving and shooting - feel cheap, weird and unrewarding. There's a big fan following though, so you might like it. I didn't.
8319	0	a	Low population. Like any games that are dying, only the pros @ hackers are left. Sad.
10226	1	a	This game has its own unique charm. I mainly played it when it was a P2P payment model. It has gotten a lot better and is unfortunatly under-rated. Although it still has some of its issues with animations and what not there is something that sparkles in this MMO's eyes. The crafting is genius and sometimes it feels like im in a real open world experience. Its built well to immerse you out of the MMO feel and not in a bad way. The combat is fun since you can approach it many different ways. Again with the crafting, its amazing.   There is absoultely nothing as satisfying as crafting your first ATV. Its a pinnacle moment of â¥â¥â¥â¥ yeah im bad. Another thing i really like is the no class style along with the in depth RPG elements. Im not really a fan of no class MMO's but it works perfect for Fallen Earth. My main issues with the game is for some people it can be somewhat confusing although the new tutorial is really helpful. I hope the community welcomes people who try the game with open arms. It would be a shame if it ever got shut down. City of Heroes was a tragic loss in all honesty for the MMO genre and would equally be so if Fallen Earth was to. Remember FE players, never make the new guys hate the game because you want to be an Eliteist and call the noobs and what not. That helps games die away.   All in all. My experience with FE has been one of a kind. Im going to give it another go with the F2P and see where i can go all over again. If you havent tried it, give it a go. Its worth getting into. It will seem odd and wierd at first but once you get used to it you will discover the genius behind this game.
126	1	a	It is not impossible to do well in this game without paying real $$, it is however very difficult. The only reason this game has not faded into obscurity is because it has a great customization suite that allows for your characters to truly be unique. The mechanics and gunplay are addicting but the issues with a competitive 3rd person perspective will occasionally leave you frustrated. GamersFirst really needs to reevaluate its monetization policy and look at maybe moving away from pay to win. Depending on the server you play on, script kiddies will be an issue, the game is 'free to play' which means you have people creating new accounts as soon as they get banned. Overall the game has its issues but for me its redeeming qualities outshine its issues. With all that said, this game is definitely not for everyone, but as it is free to play I recommend that everyone tries it out, this game could use a larger population. I have about 2000 hrs total playtime (before steam integration) and I can firmly say that its potential is being squandered by GamersFirst. IF changes come about, I could realistically see this game become a huge hit for more than the small number of people who play it nowadays.
79	1	a	This is one of the worst games I have EVER played. That still doesn't mean it's not fun, because it is. It's a ton. A ton. of fun. APB: Funloaded.
8014	0	a	game will not even play, says apb failed to initialize physx??? game wont play at all. i have a gtx 980 i7 4790k and still wont play
742	1	a	So far, still extremely fun as hell. A lot of ways you can show off your creativity, and even though the missions are repeative, if you have a good team they can prove to be a bunch of fun.  10/10
3922	0	a	An extremely poor game, riddled with hackers and bugs. This game was originally a subscription based game run by an EA owned company, but they folded and RELOADED Productions picked this game up, hence the game being renamed to APB Reloaded. The European servers I can only describe as awful, with many experiencing critical lag spikes and rubber banding. Some experienced hackers even use methods to lag switch, increasing your ping- forcing you to stay in one place; while he/she can shoot you on the spot. The hacking in this game is awful, the game company are powerless to stop it, and they have refused to update the game's anti-hack engine to sort this out. To add to insult, it's considerably easier for Criminals to make more money than enforcers, and many people have an account on both, one low ranked criminal that farms money from ram raids, and one enforcer who's a high rank and gets given the money through another account.  THE GAME: Gameplay is of a basic F2P 3rd person shooter, overly average graphics, with below average gunplay (some sub machine guns kill in 5 hits, while an assault rifle in a bigger calibre may take 7, go figure). This game is extremely pay to win, with many locks put on the player as a F2P member. See all those awesome car decals? That player's got premium. So you got premium, you've made your car but it looks all pixely? That's their new decal system, to skimp on money they lowered the texture qualities so they didn't have to purchase more servers (confirmed from staff from inside source). Many of the buy with real money guns are overpowered as heck, killing in half the time of in-game cash guns, while also being more accurate and considerably faster to reload.  THE FORUMS: Don't use them. A nasty throwback to the past, and rife with overtly corrupt staff. There are many stories of people being banned for hacks, when they get unbanned for no reason by an Admin, the two suddenly emerge as best of friends, and anyone who argues is labelled a troll and silenced. Also, some of the moderators aren't even old enough to play the game, when they recruited Forum Mods they didn't check ages all too well, and I can name a few mods who aren't old enough to play the game, let enough be a member of staff. Finally, the banning system in this game (when it works) is highly flawed. A few people have been banned innocently, but the game company refuses to hear your quarrels, as it has a policy of not contacting people on banned accounts. Have fun watching all that money get sucked away!  VERDICT: Waste of memory, this game had so much potential under EA (something rarely said) but the company who created this went bankrupt, and RELOADED products sucks. Don't get the game, it's a waste of time and memory- with nearly 550 hours on it I should know. I'll give this game a rating of 2/10, with lag spikes and hacks breaking gameplay, with a poor out of game support system too.
3556	1	a	play the best game apb and i might let you playy with me XD 
10216	1	a	Worst f2p game in the world awful controls awful gameplay you spend most of the game getting stuff for people and all you ever get for compeleting quests are dumb books first person mode looks like you're playing it on gamecube
4901	0	a	Great game, looks attractive, nice gameplay and such.. But ehh.. Doesn't really want to run.. So...ehhh.. Yeah..
6298	0	a	too boring
10298	0	a	The game 'Fallen Earth' is but a sorry excuse for a free-to-play game. This game- not being worth the memory needed to download it - would be better off unplayed and unexplored. It does manage to show a slight glimmer of a good idea/story. However it is poorly executed and continuously provides a relentless assault on both the visual and mental parts of peoples minds. With its terrible graphics and horiffic story, it made it impossible to play. Aside from the 'fantastic' amount of frames per second when I walked near an elevator, I was able to do nothing but fail to complete a mission as my game would not run past a low 12 fps. My computer plays 'Arma 3' on high at 38 fps and 'Battlefield 3' on high at 43 fps. Yet a game with graphics at par to a nintendo 64, I can not play it at past 12 fps on low graphics. Do not get this game because of the fasad of a good story. All it provides is bordem and poor execution.
1386	1	a	APB is a better GTA. Ton of customization from your toon to your car. Its very addictive. Dont lissen to the trolls on here. Sure you can buy guns for real cash but what ftp dont have that. but keep in mind the noob starting gun is just as good as a $40 cash gun. Its about your skill no the gun.   I have to admit that there is a lot of trolls. A lot of players talk â¥â¥â¥â¥ about the game on the fourms but yet they are playing the game 7 days a week. If the game is soooo bad then why do they keep playing it?   For me this game gets a 8/10 Great customization, Great over the shoulder FPS action.
7320	0	a	The most Pay 2 Win game ever created in Universe, if you like to be killed in 0,05 sec by a Player who bought premium weapons than this is your pick! Enjoy repetative missions while being called noob cause you didn't pay to win, unload 7 clips of ammo in to one guy who then kills you with 2 shots from a pistol. Only thing that is fine in the game is costumization options. This game is the worst crap ever ressurected to be a Money Milking Machine. Don't play this game.
8299	0	a	Dont waste your time on this stupid â¥â¥â¥â¥...
7385	0	a	GamersFirst is a terrible moneygrabbing company. Despite APB:Reloaded having fun gameplay and a good somewhat worthwhile (and repetetive) experience it is a 'Pay to Win' multiplayer game, where the more money you put into it the more you'll be favoured in-game. Be warned, if you do decide to pay to win, they can and most likely will take your privelages away with a delicious ban, it happened to the infamous me, twice.   Play this game at your own risk, feel free to play it even more when it's taken over by a different company that's somewhat more involved with their community.
8635	0	a	I have recently gotten back into this game, alot has changed but not all for the better.  Aside from its incredable redeeming characteristic in its diversity in customization, it is dificult to play with out getting upset, or feeling cheated. The weapon system, while reballanced slightly, remains unballanced and biased to paying players. There is still no way for a free player to obtain permanant weapons regardless of their playtime and support. Also, a word of warning for new players, G1 apears to be more concerned in making money than securing their game, paying into APB:R seems to justify players who use 3rd party programs (ie artificial aim) these players tend to have a higher concentration in the 'gold' rank.  While the world(s) are large, they lack the ability to captivate players. The only anarchic activity is played out by players, making the non-player enviroment feel boring and unrelated. Every citizen of the wold is weak and feble (killed by 1 shot from any weapon). Contact storys are boring and disregardable, and sometimes get in the way. In all the wold only feels like it was designed for PVP while i could have a more chaotic nature with a few AI alterations. If the wold felt more dangerous the storyline and premise would feel more believeable.  With the occasional trolling with cars and symbols this game, and the sparce pairing with decent  people, this game is worth playing, so long as you dont let the bull get to you. Please dont pay into G1 as it only encourages lazy developement and biased gameplay, generating a disturbingly Pay to Win enviroment that drives out good people.   This game is worth the play, if only an example to build off of and improve.  2 stars/5 and a comendation for updating glitches and issues that broke the game.
1550	1	a	good gmae. long loading screens
9571	0	a	It fell flat quite quickly, but you could have fun if you get with others
2824	1	a	Combine GTA with E-style GunZ and you get this game. It isn't a new game on the street either - its just recently been converted into free2play. Granted, the nearest Asia server is at Hong Kong, but its still hell of a fun and a challenge to drive cars with one second delay on steering. Shooting's fine though, but expect certain moments where you get awkward kills/teamkills. Yep friendly fire's on, no trigger happytarding here.  The tutorial of the game is limited to the point of being inexistent as of writing, but within minutes you should pick up the basics. Theres a (uncompleted) wiki on the game anyway, go check it out for more info  http://www.apbrwiki.com/wiki/Main_Page 
10833	1	a	Really awesome game! I reccomend this game to everyone it is amazing! You can fight and hunt down monsters! The best part is that it is completely free! Yay!
2410	1	a	ITS SWEET BETTER THEN ALL THE GTAs.
3573	1	a	Amazing customization GTA like gameplay online anarchy i love this game!
2290	1	a	Even though it looks similar to GTA, this game is unique and has a lot of potential.  Too bad, the servers are made of potatoes, the developers are the worms and the community is the salt on top.  I have been playing for about 5 years from now. An indie team could have done a better job on this game in 6 months, than the current development team in all those years.  Communication with the team is a joke. Their so called 'Community manager' posts about :  -10 nonsense comments about horses,   -4 empty patch notes,   -1 excuse why are they still not making progress with the engine upgrade,  -dozens of newly added premium stuff, they happen to create while the server room is on fire  I am still recommending the game, because the content itself is great. It's only the team behind it that su..ks. If I could I would give them 0 stars. 
7154	0	a	This game is fun and everything but if you win or if you lose is basted on luck. If your team sucks then you suck and your gonna lose but if the other team sucks more then your team sucks then your gonna win so if your team sucks its better to just leave. This game is fun but is a broken peace of â¥â¥â¥â¥ shooter that you can play if you want to but if this game was not free I would not recommend it at all. And btw to start this game is a nightmare the first time. 2/10
1272	1	a	this game is cool
266	1	a	Best F2P shooter out there. Tons of content, and Micro Transactions aren't needed to survive.
7134	0	a	LOTS OF SCAMMERS. 0/10 would never play APB again
1557	1	a	Very realistic game. Recommending it for everyone.
4139	0	a	The gameplay isn't bad... if it wasn't for the fact that this is a micotransaction filled game. All the guns have that 'buy it and own it for 9 days' kind of thing, which is annoying as hell.   I also can never seem to find other players to actually play matches with. Are people just not playing this or is the system just broken?   Has potential but just kinda sucks.
8545	0	a	If they could remake this game but making it good.. it would be soo â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ best game for some good years. But not how they fked it :3
9335	0	a	JUST BUY FALLOUT 4 OR 3 DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS 11/10
1229	1	a	Amazing alternative to gta. Awesome customization down to every single detail. 8/10 Sorry but no. So unbalanced, so glitchy. The most fun you'll have is screwing around the map killing innocent people, and trying to shoot through everybody's bullet proof glass. 3/10 Has good potential
2888	1	a	It's really got a lot of potential and is already fun if you like games like Saints Row or GTA. It has a lot of customization features and in great detail as well. The only thing I don't appreciate is the rental systems for guns, and the over priced real money purcahses. So for a free to play game it's current structure of real money purchases is highly over valued.  7/10
2115	1	a	never lets me load the game dont know why
5360	0	a	Why cant i play it?
1082	1	a	this is a good game becuase it has a uninstall botton
10696	1	a	Wont let me open version error help (recommanded DO NOT play daily or you will be to addictive listen to me)
997	1	a	This game might not be perfect, and it might be plagued with issues such as optimization, server performance, hack prevention, terrible matchmaking system (one that relies on a faulty threat level system), and more...  But, it's a game that is unlike any other, and one that has a lot of potential. The customization offered in APB: Reloaded is unrivaled: allowing you to customize your clothing, appearence, car, music, and graffiti as much as you want (within defined symbol limits; premium members [A 10$ish fee] get more layers to use).  I've played this since before it was APB:R. It's been about three long years (or, technically, like two years and like three months). It remains to be seen if APB:R will last. Management has not been kind to the game in the last two years, despite their attempts. The newest management claims to be more dedicated to fixing the game... that remains to be seen. There's a lot that needs to be done.  But if this game does get its â¥â¥â¥â¥ together (and I really, really hope it does), it could easily become popular again.   It's just got a long way to go.    Still: Give it a shot. At the very least for the customization. The game will seem bad from the get-go (the learning curve is steep and the community is awful), but try to stick around.
9228	0	a	I can't sign in. It just doesn't work. Don't know if this just is my fault or something wrong with the game. Looks like a good game but I can't make a certain justification on any gameplay as I have not yet experienced it.
2027	1	a	This game makes me sick to my stomach.  Best game ever.
2717	1	a	Fun at times but it can turn boring quickly
9858	1	a	What is Fallen Earth? Fallen Earth like a MMO Metro 2033 only minus Russians talking in English with silly Reznov voices.
2332	1	a	APB reloaded is Very Closely related to GTA however it is far from it. The game can be fun with a team or group of friends. The team Is Highly Pay to win though. People whom Pay for Prem get Everything just about and Is/are able to have better weapons and when 2xs more money in game to get things. The biggest Issue with the game is team Balance. There is none. You get matched up with people that are WAY higher ranked then you're self and they Expect you to deal with the fact that that have Armor on and BEtter weapons that wipe you out in a heartbeat. Would I recommend the game yes but For more of a casual play on occasion sorta thing
7563	0	a	When i joined this, it was fun, but it forced me to have to buy more ram just to play, but even then i lagged during any battle..  reason i dont reccomend this: SUPER cpu heavy, it lags bad if you dont have a serious up to date graphic card or more then 8gb ram, seems they put alot into graphics which causes older computers or people who dont buy computers every year not able to play it.  i still login from time to time, but it became un-fun when it was nothing but trolls bashing your car/truck into walls with garbage trucks, or children screaming on the voice system just to annoy you.  i dont reccomend this if you have a older cpu, or cant handle the graphics, also if you cant deal with kiddy trolls bashing you every 5 mins not allowing you to do anything.
6939	0	a	This game is poopoo
10053	1	a	Rich in content and F2P, no real pay wall that I've noticed.  One of the best MMOs for weak hardware, runs great on my super old laptop AMD A6-4400 APU, which is weaker than an intel integrated laptop gpu from 2013.  The grind is there but not too excessive.  You get a horse early on and other useful equipment like guns.   Easy-ish to learn. Can be confusing at first or if you haven't played in a very long time.  Great looking environments.  Can not be beat for free price tag, i'd say even at $20 it would be a great bergain. I'm not sure why people don't recommend this game more. I've always had fun in my short time with it.
2483	1	a	AWESOME GAME JUST LIKE GRAND THEFT AUTO GET IT NOW
1686	1	a	APB is a very nice game but too bad I mean get stuck in the game I play 2-3 minutes and locks. Pretty please help me. Thanks
3670	1	a	i seriously never understood what i was doing in this game, but it's fun.
5646	0	a	not worth playing...
5853	0	a	CAN you make a game that start up faster not that takes 10min to start up
4386	0	a	It's lame and it;s keep kicking me :[ P Please help ;[
5550	0	a	this is a bad game. buy gtav idiot.
7958	0	a	10/10 would never play again. game sucks. small map just a really really crapy version of GTA  
5679	0	a	Long loading screens, many time wasters, worst game ever. I deserve some hash browns.
2680	1	a	Great fun, some problems but they only small.
123	1	a	Fun, And the custom designs of clothes and cars, never end. better playing in groups of friends
10865	1	a	The game is amazing, raiding dungeons is fun with friends but you can do it by yourself if you are a high enough level, the perma death adds a bit extra to the thrill factor of the game, I haven't played it much but I am in love with the game. Me and my friend has been playing it together and I have only died twice, probably one of the best mmo's yet
9957	1	a	If you want a Fallout like MMORPG then this is your game.
512	1	a	Ive been playing this game for years and i think its time to write a review.  Cons:  1.Toxic people, a ton of them. 2. Horrible servers. 3. Everything is too expensive on the Armas marketplace, i mean seriously, 20$ for a weapon thats a reskin of the base game item. 4. Matchmaking is horrible. 5. People take the game too seriously, they have to win every mission and hate people that do bad, its kinda pathetic.  Pros: 1.There are some good people in the toxic community. 2.Its pretty fun when you get used to the game, if you can handle the servers, that is. 3.The cars/customization options. 4.Same as 3, but with clothes and character customization.
6181	0	a	This game is literally the most horrible game ever made by man/woman/aliens/zombies/whatever. It doesn't have a good community the new players gets insulted straight up,  They do not get help from any veteran players, and most of the players who see's the new players will tell them to 'Uninstall' the game and so on.. incouraging players to leave the game even more..  I'd advice GamersFirst or whoever the â¥â¥â¥â¥ runs this company's game. To take action to those who violates the term of 'Respecting New Comers to the game'  Its a thing, Please try to put it to good use. I don't see this game going anymore further in the future.. The community in this game is horrible and it literally needs a reality check. So help me, take this game down if this game gets out of hand with 'Insult every new player that steps in the game'  My rating? Not a recommended game. To those who wish to learn how to get started with the help of veteran players.  It's also P2W, So forget about it.
9132	0	a	Hmm, Hmm , yeah well this game looks cool at first but uhh yeah you have to create a account on another website, which costs  money/and,or/wasting  time watching adds to get so-called 'credits' . complete waste of time considering its free on steam, but you cant even play it unless you go through this second rate gaming site and give them money so you can play this game and get bored after 4 hours TOTAL of gameplay . Honeslty im not poor , i have money, i just wish it wouldn't be under free-to-play cause ITS NOT FREE-TO-PLAY!!!! 0 freakin' stars out of five .
4779	0	a	?
9358	0	a	Every time I tried to leave the tutorial level, the game would crash.
8067	0	a	This game is a peice of sh*t! Do not install this game UNLESS you want to fork over a good $1000 to the companies whop made this game. This is just amazing how I thought it was a good game, then all of the sudden I start playing it. For the first 10 minutes, it's OK. But then high ranking players sniper me from a lightyear away. It's redicious. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!
7103	0	a	Dont play game has gone to â¥â¥â¥â¥!!!!!
10569	0	a	This game WAS good. Then the Kabam nation attacked. They made it severely Pay To Win. When Wild Shadow owned it and oversaw the game, it was great, there was almost no pay to win elements in the game. Now, it is almost like an IOS game that is freemium. Sure, skill is still involved, but you HAVE TO PAY $$$$ to be good.   It is literally impossible to be good at this game unless you spend some money. You cannot be nearly decent at this game until you have a few character slots(you start off with one!!!!), a few vault chests(again, you start off with on!!!!), a good pet, and EXPENSIVE items that upgrade that pet.   As someone who has let their wallet vomit a bit too much( &gt;100$ spent in game), please for the love of not supporting this disgusting Pay To Win Freemium game model, don't get this game. And if you have it, dont spend $$. If you do, you are telling developers and cash grabbing companies that these kinds of games are okay to create and release to the good folk of the gaming community.
10118	1	a	Downloaded.... few minutes later. Yay! about to play the game , woops new updated, downloaded... downloaded... downloaded... meh uninstalled.  WASTE YOUR TIME SIMULATOR 2015 10/10
4196	0	a	i played this game for well over 300 hours, it full of hackers, unless you wanna spend real money on this game. i would say dont brother, this game is truly cancer
3408	1	a	armas marketplace
9447	0	a	This game crashed every time I ran it and still had bugs and when I got past the crash part it crashed aagin.... Horrible game.
1946	1	a	Meh, nice. It has the formula for a P2W game and getting items and the tutorial tasks is hard and making a decal and customising anything is far to limited. Cars and guns are good though. Love playing as my Enforcer mainly because I have done more progress on that one and im still debating whether my Criminal profile should be male or female. Plus, as both a pro and con, there are items that look awesome but are restricted which is annoying like good cars, guns and epic looking clothing and skills. Thumbs up but needs more cheap weapons and everything needs to be constantly availiable with the really epic â¥â¥â¥â¥ needing contracts.
3052	1	a	Like FTP GTA, Hoping Rockstar will be able to do something like this one day.
1513	1	a	Great game! Try it out its free, nothing to lose, great graphics, gameplay and a lot of different customizations.
2994	1	a	its like a ex wife thats really hot, you play it for one part that turns into a addiction and hate all the other parts.
1013	1	a	A truly unique gaming experience, almost endless character and gear customization, fast-paced FPS action, and the timelessness of cops vs robbers.
2265	1	a	Pay To Have Swag.... This will hold me off until gta5 comes to pc.
2625	1	a	good game with friends
4019	0	a	I haven't played this using steam but over my two accounts I have over 1500 hours and it spans from 2011-2013 , and then rest of my second account is all from late 2014 to 2015.  The game had a lot of potential but the increasingly poor decisions of the people in charge are really putting the nail in the coffin as time goes on. The game was playable and enjoyable, FPS was good and there wasn't any lag. The game has cheaters but what F2P game doesn't?   Then as time goes on you lost FPS with every patch, you can no longer play on ultra settings but need to play it on low with a special launcher that reduces textures even further, I have upgraded my rig since I've first started playing and the performance I get is absolutely laughable. The servers, for more than a month, have been having aboslutely awful connection problems due to getting 'ddosed' ( doubt it, probably just a lie) which result in constant ping spikes and people constantly teleporting around.  But as the game continues to go down the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, you can guarantee there will still be sales on the Armas marketplace so they can try and squeeze every last penny out of you before you get fed up and leave because of sheer lack of progress, transparency, and GM's that actually play the game.  Save yourself the heartbreak, maybe if you could get in a time machine and play it early 2013 you would be happy, but the state it is in now is absolutely unplayable. It's sad to see what it has become, but it's just how it is when you have clueless fools in charge.
9799	0	a	I played it. Got renamed to a ridiculous name because my name offended the you know who. Then the same mod who had renamed me popped up in main chat to ask people to keep the discussion to game related Q&amp;A. I wasnt even chatting at the time, and the people who were were simply chit chatting. Apparently this is too much for this concentration camp of a game. No fun allowed. Only talk about the game.  I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hate this â¥â¥â¥â¥. Burn down every game company that manages its users like stupid cattle. God forbid giving personal details or talking about fun stuff. It might create you know, DISCUSSION. We dont want that. We want stupid morons who only talk about the game and pay their dues. Die. Eat it and die.

I also asked a friend how he got the game to work because i saw him playing it, but he replied with 'I havent even gotten it to work, ive just been stuck in the launcher trying to fix it'

10858	1	a	Hard to master? no doubt about that, this game may look seriously old, but it's actually pretty new, it's just retro style, it's totally free to play and it's really easy to get hooked on it :D
2822	1	a	Very fun to play with friends or without friends. Either way, it's solid. Being a good change to other MMOs. The game looks amazing and even with minium settings. 8/10 stars.
3981	0	a	My computer's graphics card far exeeds the requirements of this game and yet after the 4-5 hour download supposedly my graphics card is not compatable. Just a word of warning, don't get your hopes and fall into the same trap that I did.
4986	0	a	This game sucks if you dont have real money. You only will be pwned by Professional P2P players.
1859	1	a	one of the best games ive played on steam 
365	1	a	I joined a place, I killed civs, got cops on me, robbed stores, this game is like gta  10/10
6729	0	a	Fairfight? FAIRFIGHT?! Yeah, sure, if you consider a fair fight a team of gold threat players going up against a team of new guys/girls, then sure, but for MOST people, it's horrid! How does anyone expect to advance if these matches happen every single time? GamersFirst would be better off making the game singleplayer or co-op, in my opinion, and don't even get me started on the pay-to-win part, I'm not gonna waste my time complaing about that because no one would listen in the first place. And as I'mst looking at these other reviews, I see the same thing, Horrid matchmaking, Pay-to-win, and the only good thing being great customization.  Do NOT waste your time and money with this â¥â¥â¥â¥, I've been with APB since it's beta stages, and I say that I have a better chance stumbling on a long abandoned diamond mine in the middle of the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing ocean than actually progressing without paying a cent to APB.
9130	0	a	too much lagg and it take at least 2 and a half hours to download if lucky plus another 3 to get the updates required than every once in a while while its updating itll crash so all and all this game is a P.O.S!!!!!!!! &gt;:( waste of space and i could've been playing 3 other games that r better and dont take as long to download whoever invented this game needs to fix the bugs and stop doing a P.O.S job on games like this all I have to say is you are so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing lucky this didnt cost money of so help me god, well hopefully you got fired for making this P.O.S!!! thanks for wasting my â¥â¥â¥â¥ing day waiting for this garbage
8266	0	a	This game has been rendered a 'Play only if you can't afford GTA 5, Fee to Pay game'.
7880	0	a	worst game ive ever played, the trailers look amazing but that is nothing like the game DO NOT DOWNLAOD 
5691	0	a	worst game ever, looks just like gta. but its really more like minecraft.
3	1	a	Hiya, I've played this game for a little bit now, and here is some of the reasons for me playing such an ungodly amount of time on this game APB reloaded.   1. This game is a competitive fast paced game that makes you think or die(in-game, can't speak for strokes.) I personally greatly enjoy out thinking my opponents in 1v1-3 fights. The P2W elements doesn't exist. And. the few exceptions with guns on armas(real cash store online) have usually been balanced in a couple of months.  2. Now for some of the cons, laaaaaaggggg. If you don't have a good computer your frames will be 20 fps or worst which will cap how well you can do. Not to mention the servers lag spikes that happen occasionally. Now lets deal with the hacking element. Hackers are rare. I usually see 1-3 blatant hackers per month. I.E. teleporting with a light machine gun(shaw) shooting my car as I (unsuccessfully) escape. ahhhhh the memories. They are usually banned real quick. But, there are more subtle hackes like aimbot and small speed increase that seemingly take longer to ban.   3. Now my raging is out lets focus on the positives. Designing is almost unlimited to your clothes, car , and even the music theme you victims hear when you kill them. There is a design cap for f2p players (like 4 symbols per clothing piece) but G1(the company that owns the game) is pretty good at reguler events that you can win subscription for 3 days or so. So design your heart out! Playing with friends or making friends in game and playing with them is alot of fun, win together and rage together.   4. As I referenced above G1 does holiday and sometimes random events where you can win subscription for a few days, guns, g1 coin(real cash money), or joker tickets....ect ect. I've actually collected enough g1 coins from events to unlock 2 guns permanent for account when they were 50% off. The events themselves are generally fun and different than normal missions. Like the holloween event :).  5. The community, one controversal topic. The general population of apb are usually not jerks (to put mildly), but it can be toxic, and if you don't have some tolerance for idiots you will rage alot. My best advice for handling the community is to have a friend to show off how stupid they can be at times. That is not to say there is no 'good-guys(or gals)' in-game. I have interacted with my fair share of friendly players and (rarely) people I now call friends.   6. This game can be brutal to new players starting. There are many veteran players who will decimate anyone they can heartlessly(sniff sniff). So If your thinking of starting out I cannot emphasis this enough. Stick...to...bronze...districts...........,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,.....................,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,............................... The game has a threat system. Green, Bronze, Silver, and Gold. Based on how good you do, and there are bronze, silver, ect districts you enter where people are the same threat level(skill level) as you are. Good system right? Not so much. The game allows you to enter a district that is one threat level below you. So all the golds (veterans) are in silver disctrict. So silvers and bronzes go to bronze if you want to play against players your skill level and get better(As I did. I spent over half my play time on bronze till I got better and went from silver to gold) Go to disctrict select, go to advanced selecter on the top left, go to a bronze district and hopefully not rage as much. So whenever you are silver go to bronze best advice I can give.  7. The game is a gem of a F2P game and I haven't seen one like it ever. There is alot more details in the game but I think that covers the gist of it. So, I would recomend you to try it. Worst happens you don't like it nothing lost but time, or like me, you can find a game that is alot of fun.   So in closing of this review, thanks for reading it(or skiping to the bottem of the review) Have a good day :)  Firestorm
10443	1	a	This game sucked and its not worth downloading nor playing.
2998	1	a	Awesome game recommend playing it.

5128	0	a	Too much hackers.
5463	0	a	Unbalanced pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥.  Until they actually decide to use the rank system to make the game FAIR, don't bother playing it.
8007	0	a	Bored to tears, that's what.
4878	0	a	PAY TO WIN
9559	0	a	&lt;---(Fallen Earth)- I played this before it came to steam and quit because it sucked balls. The biggest problem was the abysmal map system combined with lack of direction. I thought that would be fixed since it came to steam. I just tried it and its exactly the same stupid â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. There is no excuse for such dumb â¥â¥â¥â¥ in the year 2012. Quit making games that make human beings look like they haven't evolved passed the Atari and Donkey Kong. This is a really crappy game. It feels generic as fk and is a total waste of anyones time. ANYONE.
9403	1	a	Open world, sandbox. No linear story. Start from anywhere, anytime. No limited zone based on player level.  Limited outfits only for faction armors, weapons and accessories; 90% of the items in the game can be obtained and worn. Huge array of cosmetics items for your toons.  Crafting-based game with about 90% of the items in-game are craftable.  Huge world using real topography of the great Grand Canyon.   Been playing online games since 1999 and by far this is one of the best in the apocalypse category.  Best game ever!
7165	0	a	10/10 Would drive on ice roads again
4190	0	a	Slightly enjoyable when playing with a group of friends... not a stellar recommendation but it is words put together to form a quasi-sentence.
2961	1	a	A Good fun game , It's much better with friends, The only thing i can complain about is the fact that you can only buy weapons that run out after 10 days, Or you can pay real money or farm for 1-2 months to earn one, If you go to buy one with money the cheapest for a character is 28 euro. (Perm for that char)
5919	0	a	Games trash. Not worth any time, pay to win
8599	0	a	Don't â¥â¥â¥â¥in play this game  is cancer  I broke a chair
5199	0	a	Ugh, so i played this game in 2014 and had around 600+ hrs.. I saw mostly positive review's on the game thought it got better or something, downloaded it, and reminded myself why i removed it from my pc in the first place. ------------------ Game: ------------------ Graphics - Good. Character Customization - Probably the best i've seen. Physics - Bad Car Handling - Fine  ------------------ Is this Game P2W,  ------------------ Yes this game is p2w probably the worst p2w game you will see on the market, people with just a little bit of experience and some money on their mom's credit card will top frag anytime.   ------------------ For those who wan't to buy DLC's or such: ------------------ Don't download anything, the game has too many cheaters its just not worth the money! The game concept is made that you have to buy at least 5 types of weapons to actually be good at the game, having premium gives you at least 3x advantage.  ------------------ For those who say the game is not p2w. ------------------ Many people that leave positive review on the game bought ig weapons and dlc's the players constantly claim that the game is not p2w even though it gives you way more advantage. The game is not skillbased game if you are best player in APB and playing aginst a enemy that is decent with a p2w weapon he will kill you 1000%.   DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME! YOU WILL GET ADDICTED AND GO TO THE PART WHERE YOU CAN'T PLAY AGINST P2W PLAYERS. JUST NOT WORTH IT! NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL!!!!!      
5533	0	a	This game is aids and you shouldn't spend money on it
9770	0	a	Lmfao I keep crashing at the beginning of the game and when I try to edit options, the menu that pops up will close itself immediately after. Too buggy.
8663	0	a	An awesome game , ruined by his publisher. Try it just for fun , if u wanna win , you will have to pay.
2384	1	a	This game still exists?
9256	0	a	Dull system, dull quests, dull story, dull interface, dull graphics, dull sound... need I go on?
511	1	a	Hey guys, after a shÃ­tstorm of playtime I decided to give the community some of my toughts.  Obviously, we are talking about a game thats still alive after several years, and it has a reason, but I think this is about to be gone. Back in 2013 I stopped playing this game, and now in 2015 I gave it another go. I was dissappointed, not because it went worse or dead, it isnt. But there is no such new stuff that players were always dreaming of. More than a year gap, and I can say, nothing new, just some OP Armas Marketplace weapons, and a car kit. I was expecting at least a new vehicle, a roadmap, or at least hackers gone (and im not even that courageous to dream about a new district). Anyways, I hope once the server merge is done, devs will give attention to such a stuff like these, so now, I suggesting this game.  The pros: -Big community, you will always find buddies to play with, or get help. -Promo codes, I hope devs willing to keep provide them. -Open worlds with some gamemodes, and different servers for each (to make the matchmaker more fair). -Random and kinda colorful missions. Every mission is a different story. -Customization, including: music maker, car sound/kits/paint, Sims like character making+tattoos, and a lots of clothes...And this is the main point of the game, seriously, it has no pair. I would rather describe this game as a F2P art game with shooting possibilities. You can almost literally can customize everything, if you like designing, you will love this game. -Decent amount of perks/mods for cars/character/weapons, there is no best or worst set, everything depends on your playstyle. -Marketplace, where you can sell and show your badass stuff. Or buy. -Events. Make use of them, they are usually nice farming possibilities.  The cons: -Unbalanced weapons. Some of them that you can buy for real money, are obviously the way more powerful than those you can buy for in-game money, giving a p2w feeling. Still, you can try out some for free. -Server lags, not an usual problem, altough when it kicks in, you better just log off (I hope server merge will kill this). -Hackers. They will be always around with tasty aimbot and wallhack. FairFight is not enough to keep them away. -A lot of annoying no life as$holes, who like to harass others, even if they are on the same side. I just suggest ignore asap. -Weird car physics. They seem to be too slow and too heavy. -Designing possibilities are too limited with freemium account.  The two sided: -If you dont want to play missions, there is a possibility to hang around, race etc...That means of course, if you are on a mission, you still can get rammed and harassed by any other player. -Epic grinding. It keeps you playing, although without premium account its much harder to get money.  Tips for newbies: -Do the tutorial missions asap, look for the one that gives you a LIFETIME weapon. You will need it, you really dont want to re-buy your weapon every 10 days. -Spend some time at Social district and try out every editor. Also, thats the best place you can ask for help. -If you harassed by anyone 'superior' to you, just use '/report *name*' then '/ignore *name*', and if needed change instance. -Make sure you switched off auto-ready system, so you wont go on mission until you dont want. -Save money and joker tickets, dont spend them inmedetadly. -Always go for sure, check your ammo and grenades every time. -Just a performance tip, when you enter a district, take a trip from its end to the other, so most things will load, and you lower the chance of a performance lag.  I hope some of you can use it. If you have questions just ask. See you on battlefield!
729	1	a	I know I put recommended, but it's only really because the game is free. It is extremely pay to play/win, but there is decent gear you can get for free. I did on the whole enjoy my time playing, but when the enemies had OP â¥â¥â¥â¥, it was EXTREMELY annoying. If you dont mind it taking quite a while to get good â¥â¥â¥â¥, and/or spending a few bucks, its great, otherwise, play a different game.
9331	1	a	Love the game reminds me of a old fallout game classic!
1001	1	a	Its ok
9316	1	a	I Didnt figure out the system to play, but i think its decent for a f2p!
1328	1	a	this game is good, i made a character named LegolasTheGreat and put custom made swastikas and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ on his shirt, so far ppl have been telling me that im reported and i should kill myself cuz im a nazi monster. im not getting banned long time, tho. so if u wanna burst some bubbles and make some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ butthurt - this game is for you, cuz u can design the ultimate nazi gear.
125	1	a	A very cool openworld shootergame with alot of costumization options (cars, death theme's, clothes,...). This game provides alot of weapons you can choose out. I playing this game for a while now and i'm still loving it! For beginners is it in the beginning of the game very frustrating that you gonna play against very good players. But when u play alot u will become good 2. :) (sorry for my bad english)
7126	0	a	Gameplay is not smooth at all, and it is unoriginal. Well, atleast I did not loose any money, time, or my soul to this game
8853	0	a	PURE SHIIIT
1073	1	a	Good game, terrible company. By the time you read this the servers will prolly be dead.
8100	0	a	Don't touch this game unless you have friends (AND U GUYS PRBLY DONT LOL). It's completely and utterly garbage without it. No but seriously, this game is an utter mess, it's good fun with your friends but otherwise you deal with a toxic community, a questionable company and so many hackers that the braindead community can't distinguish between the real ones and players that just play a lot.
2319	1	a	This is a good game.
1281	1	a	1. Steal a car 2. Crash the car into a shop window. 3. Rob the store and load the car. 4. Deliver stolen goods to black market dealer. 5. Repeat process.
10294	1	a	Good game with Oblivion and Fallout elements
7702	0	a	hello?....hello? is anybody there....no okay im gone
3026	1	a	good to play with friends

2052	1	a	If only
1916	1	a	Such A good game obviously it is better with DLC but good game and its the only style of game for free
5842	0	a	this sucks, i can't even get on 
2769	1	a	APB Reloaded through steam was ten times fasted on the download/patch and game update. It like playing gta 5 online for free, with much more customization and its just a un experience. I have recomanded this game to many of my friends and i recomand that it should be played through steam.
7861	0	a	A run of the mill third person shooter disguised as a free roam gta style type game, the world is dead, theres nothing to do but objective based missions against other players the only thing this game has is its customization. Not to mention this game defines the meaning of pay to win.
10431	0	a	This is the worst game I have ever played. It is ugly, and has horrible gameplay.
5262	0	a	this game takes your money like an insurance company claims tax.
6897	0	a	Sorry but this is a joke, after many hours of downloading, it installed and started updating which was fine by me, seemed normal, until the update got to 100% and nothing happened, it started saying 'installing Direct X' which i obviously already have. After maybe 20 minutes of confusion i looked around the steam forums, followed some advice, but this time when i clicked play, it bought up the same download window and just started downloading something different. After this it successfully ended, however the game STILL won't play. It either does nothing or says the application is already running (which it isn't.)  Pretty disgraceful, i downloaded Left 4 Dead 2 without a problem and it works fine. APB seems to be severely fukced. I know it's free to play but you still expect it to actually work after the installation progress.   EDIT: Just found out that on this game you have to pay REAL LIFE money for IN GAME guns, games like this should be ended. Money grabbing bull****.  ANOTHER EDIT: So yeah since this i've downoaded many games via Steam, none had any sort of problem what so ever, games i've downloaded and am able to run normally include Rust, Outlast, The Forest, Next Car Game, Battlefield 3, the list goes on, APB goes in the â¥â¥â¥â¥ list with gaming atrocities like Velvet Sundown who wouldn't even run.
130	1	a	This game is a lot of fun. If you like Grand Theft Auto but want a straight PvP experience, this is for you. There are NPCs who give you missions, but the missions are all PvP. It's still fun to play alone when I have some time to kill, but it's a far better experience if you can partner up with at least one other person to help coordinate against your opposition.   A wide variety of mission objectives keeps things very interesting. It's rarely a situation of 'kill all the cops before they kill you.' Jacking cars, tagging walls, hacking satellite dishes, stealing people's organs for sale on the black market, bounties on high threat players, bombing buildings, mugging people, stealing and destroying evidence before it can get into a court, street racing, raiding electronics and jewelry stores, fencing the stolen goods, laundering money...it's crazy how much trouble you can cause!  Customization is awesome. You can apply custom graphics all over your car, your clothes, your body. People who don't like the in-game clothing options will often tattoo their own clothing designs right onto their characters' bodies. It makes for a really deep customization experience, and you'll regularly be turning your head to get a closer look at what cool customization someone else has come up with. It is amazing.  I have one complaint. This game is most definitely 'pay-to-win.' $40 of G1C (cash shop currency) gets you an amazing gun with amazing mods that eats through all other players easily. So if you usually spend $40 on a game you'll play for a couple hundred hours, go for that since you otherwise don't need to spend any money to play this game. People who spend money will often beat you no matter how skilled you become.   The cash shop has cheaper pay-to-win guns, but they expire after X number of days. The guns you buy with in-game money all expire after 10 days. Fortunately there's not much else to do with all the in-game money you accumulate so it doesn't really hurt.

7179	0	a	The most Pay 2 Win game ever created in Universe, if you like to be killed in 0,05 sec by a Player who bought premium weapons than this is your pick! Enjoy repetative missions while being called noob cause you didn't pay to win, unload 7 clips of ammo in to one guy who then kills you with 2 shots from a pistol. Only thing that is fine in the game is costumization options. This game is the worst crap ever ressurected to be a Money Milking Machine. Don't play this game.

10210	0	a	Trust me when I say this game is awful. It has terrible loading times and over all is a glitchy mess to play. And since it's a free to play game it is legally obligated to have microtransactions in it, and boy are there plenty.
8956	1	a	Still waiting for that Fallout Online pipedream?? While it may be on its way with a- and lets be honest, long overdue announcement. Fallen Earth is here to scratch away those Post-Apocolyptic itching blues.
5499	0	a	i will install this game back if the company stops focusing on the money and starts focusing on feedback  2/10  (i dont have 16.4 hrs on apb btw)
5465	0	a	I don't know why I am reviewing this to be honest I didn't play 26 hours of this game. It kept coming up and when I closed it then it came up again. So this game is alright, I guess you could call it a cheap rip off of GTA. This game really isn't to my interest I do not recommend this game. I would rate it a 4/10
5854	0	a	No. Not right now
9762	1	a	like every other zombie survival game but free2pley
8347	0	a	I honestly would NOT recommend this game to new players!   Some Resons Why:  -No balancing system at all -Pay to win -Takes f*ck loads of hours to get a gun decent enough to fight people with -Did i mention pay to win? Oh i did? Its soo pay to win i put it again -Grindy as â¥â¥â¥â¥kkk!!! (it takes wayyy to â¥â¥â¥â¥ing long to get CLOTHES! CLOTHES FOR GOD'S SAKE)  Here are some things that happen in this game.  Only played for about 7 hours, get on to have some fun expecting a balace system, gets into a match, gets â¥â¥â¥â¥ed as soon as it loads up. Holds tab, finds out that they are MUCH higher in rank. Loses match.  If you enjoy all of these things...go ahead and play this game. I still probably will but i still hold firm on saying that new players should NOT play this game unless there is a friend who can guide them.
3935	0	a	I love what this game could have been. Pros: - Fantastic customization  - Some fun concepts  Cons: - Repetitive and boring quests - Performance is poor - A 'Toxic' community - The definition of pay2win (Very strong weapons locked behind pay walls) - A good portion of players hacked the game when I was playing - Developers that just don't seem to care at all about any of the present issues  The reason I played such a long time was because I met a really good group of friends in game.We made our own fun and just screwed around most of the time. It's a shame that the game turned out the way it did.I know I would have loved it if it wasn't so incredibly broken and neglected.  Don't waste your time on this game ,because the devs sure haven't put any of theirs into it.
2228	1	a	This game is pay2win
175	1	a	very fun, its basically a f2p gta
1467	1	a	Great game, bad hosting company.
5982	0	a	This game needs controller support, just saying....
1561	1	a	The game is fairly decent, but I think more can be done to make this game perfect. One of things I believe this game needs is some sort of Campaign or PvE mode. Why you may ask? Well, due to the fact that not everyone is professional at PvP battles. Something like that would defintiely make this FTP game a whole lot more fun. That, and it would probably bring in a lot more players into the game as well.  And with that being said, it's a decent game. Just not perfect...
4890	0	a	It's like a really bad version of GTA 5
693	1	a	[8/10] Nice action shootem up online game
1694	1	a	It's kind of like GTA but with more grinding and hella unbalanced weapons. You'll rage a lot, but it's such a wonky and silly game that you'll enjoy it anyway. But bring a friend, if you do.
8298	0	a	This a great game, but the community sucks... And the Support don't care about you just care about your pocket if you have money they will accept it, but if you need help they will just ignore you or say that they can't do nothing for you. So that's why I don't like this game, but I'm already addicted, I'm getting cancer and bla bla... So for your life if you want to be happy and get a family one day don't play this game.
4997	0	a	Big waste of hard drive space, time, and money. It is boring and has TERRIBLE gameplay mechanics.   Do not download!
9949	1	a	Not a bad game by any means. It's fun, enjoyable, does get repetitive at times..but you spend no money on it out of the box, and there is no box.  Thing is, you can only craft one item at a time, before having to buy at least one thing, to get more slots. Can suck, as that's 'one item', not 'one stack of items'..
7878	0	a	the game is really fun but its ruined by how badly they want you to spend real money on the game. in order to get anything decent or cool you need to pay money for god damn points. you can only have 2 decals on your car if u want more u need to pay. character stuff u need to pay. f that. basically this game should be called money waster simulator. if they get rid of the money and make a way to get those stuff then 8/10.
7225	0	a	i dont like it, you shouldn't either          don't ask why
6262	0	a	This game is more disgusting then my great grandmothers MeatLoaf. I dont reccomend it, They leave you with no clue how to do anything
6791	0	a	Until this became 'pay to win' it was a very enjoyable game. I spent many hours with friends running down cons in our pimped out squad cars. I was happy to pay the minor monthly fee back then for that bit of near hackerless fun and no PTW store. I noticed a lot of 'features' cost $ that before the changeover didn't, a way to make an extra buck for the devs I guess.
6757	0	a	I played this game for a very short time, but i can say for sure certain its a waste of time, the bugs are horrible graphics are glitched and things can appear blurred on high spec machines the gameplay between the two factions is also disgracefully unbalanced. its more P2W not F2P.
478	1	a	A very good game, really fun if playied with your friends.  It's a bit complicated to understand when you're a newbie, just look for a veteran that will explain you ;)

10588	0	a	Used to be my fav game, but now you have to buy heaps of stuff to be good, tis a shame.
3539	1	a	IT'S NOT AN ADDICTION MAN! I CAN STOP ANY TIME DON'T â¥â¥â¥â¥IN JUDGE ME!I JUST DO IT IT IN MY SPARE TIME DON'T THINK I HAVE A PROBLEM YOU HAVE A PROBLEM â¥â¥â¥â¥FACE!
1749	1	a	I honestly don't understand what people are complaining about- granted so far I've only clocked in 4 hours of gameplay in the two days that I've had it. Yeah, it's a bit glitchy, has a few hackers, and omg the car controls are so wonky I can hardly drive... but for what it is- it's a good game. You go around shooting people, making money, and unlocking content as you go to customize your character even more. Yeah, some things you have to pay for obviously the money is going into keeping the game up and running. And yes, it can get kind of boring after about 2-3 hours of consecutive gameplay without any friends.. but if you switch servers here and there (which can be tricky when the glitches decide to act up at this moment) and focus on getting your loot (so your character isn't boring as heck to look at).. you fill the time. If you actually talk to people you will see a lot of them are pretty decent and nice- not trolling asshats. With the reviews I've read around various sites, I was expecting everyone to be on my case because I'm new. I was expecting total disregard for teams. I was expecting huge trolls and hackers sitting around waiting for a guy like me to come around. Not the case. Besides, what are you expecting from a game that you play online, objective to kill, and it's free? I totally recommend the game to anyone looking to have some fun. It's pretty casual for the most part. You can even just stand around and talk if you feel like it. Rating: 7.5(almost an 8)/10.
2201	1	a	10/10 good for kids who arent old enough for gta yet i started playing this in 4th grade i played the crap out of it this game is technically almost like gta online but this came first some parts simular some parts not seriously try this game amazing best game of 2011-2014
25	1	a	This game obviously still needs some development such as optimization, but honestly that's about it. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys teamplay or just fun. Once in to Silver servers it become more competitive so practice to be able to play there against most players. The game still has a small issue of dealing with hackers but from the start hackers have been less and less seen. The game is NOT pay to win, all the armas market items are simply reskins of guns that you can buy from contacts, and even some of the guns you can buy from contacts seem to be better then a lot of the guns you can buy from Armas market.  All in all a good game. :)
1239	1	a	The biggest most funnest online open world multiplayer out there!
10619	0	a	well the game is completly PAY To â¥â¥â¥â¥ING WIN! now that it sucks! i realy hate kabam!
5127	0	a	Close to being one of the best games ever thats why i play it but there is still so much wrong with it 2 traniees vs 2 max rank golds with a OSMAW and Atac
1939	1	a	I got killed by jumping off a 1 story building  10/10
10323	1	a	Scratches that fallout itch for post apocalypse good overall free to play. 7/10
4488	0	a	This game is absolute garbage. Unless of course you feel like spending your money to have an advantage over everyone...
9061	1	a	Fallen Earth, in my opinion, is one the best MMOs I've played; the community is very helpful when needed and the GMs keep the help section of the chat regulated and reduce spam as much as possible. There are a total of 55 player levels as of now, im only level 30 so I havent really seen everything, but from what I have experienced, a very enjoyable game.    For me, the one biggest problem is definitely the client-to-client synchronization. Players may look as if they are in a position, but really they may not be there. You may also see NPCs glide across the screen due to the synchronization being terrible, but it has improved a bit. In the beginning, you start off with an axe, two knives, and three pellet guns (one being an air rifle and the other two being pistols). After about two or three of the beginning missions, you are awarded a horse for basic transportation, but as you progress further into the game, you get other mounts/vehicles. The basic vehicles are: ATVs, Motorcycles, Dune Buggies, and Interceptor Speedsters (basic cars). Each vehicle has many different variations that you can craft.    The crafting system isnt too complex, but it can be very slow; vehicles can take up to a few days to fully craft from raw materials, but smaller items, such as ammunition, can take a few minutes. If crafting isnt your thing, then there is also an auction house in almost every city; here you can buy player-listed items for how ever much the player lists the item for.    If youre someone who absolutely has to have good graphics, then you may not be too fond of this game; the graphics are pretty bad, but that shouldnt really be too big of a deal if you dont mind it. There are also limits to free to play players however, but they can easily be negated by purchasing any single item from the game's market place. The only limitations i am aware of are a limit to how many chips you can have (currency), a character limit of only one character and no access to the Global chats, but there may be more. In my opinion, its definitely worth it to go 'freemium' by just buying a really cheap item from the store, or by purchasing the Survivalist Package that is offered by Steam. I believe that the limit to the amount of chips you can have if you are free to play is about 100,000 chips. This would be 10 red chips and each red chip is 10,000 chips. Chips go by: Yellow&gt;Red&gt;Blue&gt;White. Blue is 100 white, Red is 100 Blue and Yellow is 100 Red.    There is a total of six different sectors in the game (The entire province is huge, roughly 83km by 83km, according to the Wiki) which all have different fast travel locations that you must first travel to via mount/vehicle. The game also encourages palyers to use roadways with vehicles as they provide a 'boost' and significantly increase your speed. There are also six major factions you can choose to be a part of once you reach Sector 2: The Techs, The Enforcers, Travelers, The Lighbearers, The Vistas, and The CHOTA. Each faction provides unique equipment that you cannot use unless you have a certain reputation with the appropriate faction.   All in all, a very enjoyable game that will last a while if you can dedicate yourself to playing.
7776	0	a	This game's anti cheat/hack system is a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥.Kicks you out when ever you attempt to login b/c it thinks you are cheating. Not to mention this game is super glitchy. I can't even play for five minutes before it freezes or boots me out. 0/10
10165	1	a	A Cool F2P Apocalypse game!
600	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ my â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ this games good
2040	1	a	I'm tom cruise and I say this game is good.  I like pie.
1121	1	a	Can't even register an account.   Best uninstaller simulator, 11/10 Would uninstall again!
9111	1	a	I was there at start before the layoff when everyone got to eat their contract and was told to walk. The skelton crew that followed and the people who tried to keep it together (sorry Tiggs) just couldn't do more than bandage the wound. Was an awesome idea and I loved what it could have been but it's over. The company who owns it now isn't even the original one because they gave up on it and essential bugs that needed to be addressed never will as the only people who really understood it were fired early in a bid to get what little cash they could. My guess is the company that now holds it is just doing the same thing, trying to get some random subs before dropping it too. RIP Fallen Earth and thanks for the few good memories there were.
6073	0	a	Poor optimization
9748	1	a	
813	1	a	I took out 3 snipers using bricks 11/10   (Also IF you see a reveiw saying this game is P2W its really not if u have the skill u can deystroy ANY weapon u find in the Armas Market i would say this game is more like P2C=Pay to Convience which bascially means ur able to get bttr modded weapons quicker BUT i will say there WAS one p2w gun that they NERFED which was the Vas r2 Troublemaker which so OP that it could out gun a sniper at long ranges Sometimes)
3972	0	a	The concept of this game is really cool. Its kinda like a GTA online shooter, its completly open world and the customization possibilities are HUGE! You can literally create everything for your character!   A big downside of this game is the ingame shop. Im playing at gold rank without any premium stuff and weapons and 90% of my opponents are just people with premium to get more money and Golden Weapons with max Upgrades from the store. Not having these can make the game very frustrating since your opponents will just be stronger in any way without much skill. They reg Health faster, their weapons deal more dmg, their accuracy is higher. For example there is a premium SHOTGUN, that hits you for almost full dmg without being in melee combat, which is highly frustrating to play against. This is just an example.   The principle of the game is still fun, but the P2W model ruins it a lot in my opinion.
8381	0	a	An empty shell of my favorite game. Overrun by hackers and bots.
9573	0	a	I used to view this game positive since it reminds me of my childhood but after playing recently I realised how much this game sucks its like a degraded boring version of Fallout... If you are still playing this then go try fallout already
8565	0	a	I don't get what this game is about
10394	0	a	Worst game ever 2014  Wouldneverplayagain/10
5244	0	a	FPS drops harder then the twin towers
7691	0	a	After some time playing APB, and spending some money on 30-day premium account, I would not recommend the game. The game is full of hackers, the matchmaking is awful. Gold-rated players vs Bronze-rated players. The server lags every 5 minutes. The 'comunity' is full of annoying and toxic people. For new players, the game is non-friendly.  If you plan to buy guns, vehicles or stuff like that, for 30-day or lifetime, prices are way too high. I find the developers so greedy.   However, the game has a lot of customization chances, and the open world, free roaming and missions are good. But they don't justify the game itself.
8277	0	a	Pay to win crap...ad that is all i have to say. Pay to Win or pay to do anthing really..cant customize anything unless you shell out cash
5372	0	a	I don't know why I have 72 hours on this game. What the â¥â¥â¥â¥?
1250	1	a	it's fun try itr out
5581	0	a	I would call this game Pay to Win. Argue if you want, but it's a multiplayer PVP game for the most part and you can buy cooldowns, permanent weapons ( some with exclusive mods, ) 2.25 times more cash gains etc...  You can buy pretty much everything permanently with real money right off the bat, be it cars, weapons, etc. If you want to be 100% Free to Play, be ready to spend tons of gold on 10-days lasting weapons. You will have to gather money for days to get one permanent weapon, only if someone is selling one on the Marketplace. The community is terrible, there's many bugs, random downtimes which cancel your missions and you lose the rewards you would have gotten for that misson. Also you can slaughter the whole city and be unnoticed, but be wary that breaking a store window by mistake, not even stealing anything and the other players playing enforcers can arrest you and steal all the money you have on you!  Also the matchmaking is terrible, sometimes you get matched with 2 other silvers and you have to face 3 golds. Your whole team could be rank 20 and you play against rank 200+ which have more mods, better cars, knows the game more and have better weapons. You have ''Bronze, Silver and Gold'' servers, but they're full of golds who like to pwn noobs either way. Only the leader can call for backup and people go AFK randomly pretty often.  Also, if your team leader ( which seems to be random because 90% of the time I join a mission I am not the leader, ) decides that he dosen't like you, he can kick you right before the mission ends to make you lose all the money and experience you would've gotten. He can also kick you just because you killed him by mistake, just because you sprayed a tag before him or even because you are MVP and he wants to be MVP instead!  The good? It's probably one of the only MMO that looks like GTA and Saints Row. The graphics are ok and the game has alot of content. Sadly, it's not a game I would play more than I already did after noticing all the flaws it has.  Here's the benefit of premium ( forums says it's 12.50$ per month: )  Around 90% bonus to all Contact XP gains. +125% bonus cash gain ( Instead of 500$ for a mission you would gain 1125$. ) 20% discount on the Armas Marketplace ( Real money marketplace. ) 50% shorter cooldown on abilities like Field supplier, Nitro booster, etc. ) Deeper Customization (50 Symbols per Vehicle / Clothing items, 100 layers per Symbol. ) Removal of Subscription ADS ( which appears at the end of all missions. ) Armas Trials for weapons and vehicles last 3 hours instead of 30 minutes ( which makes using the 200~ trials, 6 times more effectively. )
7515	0	a	Game always gives problems no matter what computer I have. For about 3 years i've been trying to get it to work. Welp
10121	0	a	Boring and mediocre.

3908	0	a	Been playing since Real Time Worlds. Very customized, upgraded, armed characters. Migrated account when G1 took over. Had a lot of fun. Bought lots of G1 items. Premium too. In one of the first ban sweeps I was banned. Apparently they erroneously banned over 2000 people when this happened. I got unbanned. Then got banned again the next day. Contacted G1; my support ticket was locked, I was banned from G1 forums after posting what happened, and all my accounts were locked. Over $100 down the drain, and my RTW character. Avoid this game. It had a time when it was good; that time is not now. Maybe when they upgrade to the next Unreal engine but besides that, avoid. Bad customer service, money hungry devs, rage-filled community, very PTW items and fair matchmaking does not exist. The Bronze Gold Silver tier matchmaking just doesn't work. Avoid.  Pros: good customization Cons: Angry player base, PTW weapons, bad customer service, money hungry devs, unbalanced matchmaking   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   they banned my original RTW account, unbanned it, then rebanned it again for no reason. My account name was Flonga, and was completely clean. i was banned in a erroneous ban along with 3,000 other players. I paid lots of dosh and played many hours. I hate this game. But I'm redownloading it because I love it so much. But my RTW account is forever gone and for no reason at that. My thread that I created on the forums got many hits and replies and was brought to the attention of the staff. They unbanned me along with many others. In a short amount of time I was banned again for no reason, just like the first time. I posted in the forums again and was BLOCKED FROM ALL FORUM COMMUNICATIONS BECAUSE THEY WERE TRYING TO HIDE MY THREAD THAT EMBARASSED THEM. I made another account to post on the forums and that was blocked as well. I love RTW, I really hate Reloaded studios. And still I'm redownloading it. I hope one day they will unban me (because I did literally nothing wrong like wtf). Until then, this game is terrible. But I love it. But it's terrible. I had so many weapons cars and mods and weapon mods and apparel and symbols and everything is gone. For what? Give me my account back that was TAKEN away from me
3165	1	a	This Game would be more fun , if it have boat or motorcycle
6127	0	a	from the moment you install this game , one thing becomes clear , you can pay to win , you have to pay to win , did i mention that winning is for sale ?  on paper the concept is solid , cops and robbers , sounds fun right ? well its not exactly cops and robbers , the police faction is exactly the same as the criminal faction functionally speaking. you can run over pedestrains as a cop and no one gives a â¥â¥â¥â¥. theres no stake here for fun , the combat is â¥â¥â¥â¥ and P2W , the cars arent fun to drive unless you grind like a korean , thats so will cave in, just say â¥â¥â¥â¥ it and pay them. look just do yourself a favor and stay away from this one, trust me , i know i wish i had.
7207	0	a	Download, click play. Open popups in Firefox randomly, Close popups. Opens random instaler for updates, takes an hour on 50mbps fiber optic line, once updated click Start, never starts. Bring up control pannel, it's running, end process, repeat that action 3 times, game starts, black box around screen because it can't support my huge tvs high rez, overly long tacky loading screens, then logs me in with steam, then asks for Email to create account. Nhilisticly shake head, uninstall. 10 turds out of 10, would not turd again.
10753	1	a	Have Fun with friends for a couple of hours. Nothing more.  Pretty heavy pay2play, I mean a lot of features are only available by spending money on this game. There, I prefer to buy a game once and play.
2102	1	a	this game is amazing (if you have friends to play with)  you can be anyone you want to be, from ugly â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ to adlof hitler lol ( thats okay im jewish) 
9502	0	a	this game is sooooo bad. Physics are terrible, no sounds when walking, shooting, punching, i will never play this game again be the way this game's graphics are bad and in pictures are better but... I don't recommend to play this game.
1680	1	a	This Game Is only fun with friends but if you are anti social and want to play a dumbed down GTA clone with other people this game is perfect for you
2264	1	a	OK Game. The graphics are alright, and you have a fun experience.
2835	1	a	APB Reloaded, pretty fun MMO. I enjoyed the time I played it. I recently stopped playing it. Idk why. It got really boring after a while. Pretty much this is a Grand Theft Auto MMO. Which I was excited about! Grinding for money also got boring. The game was really p2w. All the good weapons you had to pay money for. I recommend this game to GTA and sandbox type game fans. Just try it out, you might get bored, you might keep playing it!
255	1	a	People saying this game is pay 2 win are just extremely poor at the game. Sure some cars are expesnive. But who gives a â¥â¥â¥â¥, you always end up stealing a car on the street for the missions. Skins on the guns are useless. Some of the weapons are very good, but they can all be bought for ingame currency which isnt hard to get any of. Weapons are very balanced. Snipers arent overpowered at all.
1903	1	a	Me: 'What's that sound?'  Brian: 'I didn't tell You? This is the Talavan.'  Brian: 'Talavan? Wait, why did you get ou-' BOOM (Assorted laughter) Me: 'F*** You, Brian.'
4580	0	a	This. Is NOT one of the good ones. Beta was great, now its just full of P2W items and teamkilling â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Sure the reviews are ''mostly postive'' but aint nothin positive about this game.
9956	0	a	Horrible game. The interface is clumsy and unintuative, even with customization. The graphics are sub-par, and hardly anything in the game can be interacted with, even though there are what appear to be useful items strewn about. Don't waste your time with this one.
7985	0	a	The customisation is immense, and it was enjoyable buying a new car and pimping it up. Being able to play while listening to my own music and hearing that music muffled blasting out of the car when I left it really made me feel like this was me doing the crime. I found driving around committing small smash and grabs did get a bit tedious but I did have some fun playing with real world mates in this game. The weapon and firing part of the engine is a bit wack and playing with the default guns against people who have rented or paid real money for better guns felt totally pointless.   I did really enjoy playing this game but the higher the level I got the worse the attitude of my team mates became. I counted one night I was booted from 9 out of 10 attempts to play a team mission. I frequently got private message abuse after being kicked.  I have played MMOs and FPSs online for 15 years and these are the worst players I have seen for welcoming people with less skill than them. This is the sole reason I stopped playing.   I would however not recommend it as the game modes and ways to make money are not as immersive as other games out there even though this is FTP.
10495	1	a	It suck serious â¥â¥â¥ 
1425	1	a	very good....to a point....but the good is way more then the bad
327	1	a	Honestly a overall good game only current issue is the players otherwise this game needs some new players so dont rage keep playing and you'll see you can have fun in the end
10630	0	a	If You Run out into the realm like a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ with expensive items you bought with real money   Youre gonna have a bad time
4539	0	a	Pretty bad game, gets really repetitive and boring, the shooting is kind of off... But it has great customization. Must put a lot of money or a ton of time into the game to really get something out of it. Used to be a great game... used to....
3714	1	a	its so bad its good
10508	1	a	Realm of the Mad God (RotMG) is a great game at certain times, but then you can feel like you have wasted too much time on it. Once you get to level 20 the game is going to give you a cookie, then kick you in the shins and take the cookie back. Generally speaking in a neutral point to review, this game will most likely pull you in once you put some time into it and you will grow to hate the game when you die, and then find it creeping back on your a few weeks/months later and have a sudden desire to play again. Once you die there is no way to recover your character or any of the items, which is the most frustrating part of the game. However, you can pay real money (which I'm not a fan of, but in no way would I consider this a pay-to-win game) to get more characters slots so that you can still have the other guys when you die. Play this game if you have a lot of extra time because it will pull you in fast.
3377	1	a	Easily a great game with amazing customization aspects and gameplay, but unfortunately falls short due to a mediocre matchmaking system. If you're persistent enough to push through the bad parts of the game and play with friends, there is a huge potential for lots of fun to have.
3542	1	a	More or less like a free version of GTA Online.
9194	0	a	This game gave me cancer
952	1	a	This game is like Yoyaz's house.Dark and full of wierd smells.

4680	0	a	Not cool.. Why? Never could play on that game and have fun on it... (sadly) Never could make a chracter I like will looks like.. Never works= always crashed..  Never like it Thought - its copy of GTA.. I not like it Saw the multi not liked it thogut ..  Annd my score is 3/10..
8357	0	a	do not go near this game, hackers the likes of which makes WoW looks safe. Pay to win doesnt even cut it, its literally pay to play. if you dont spend large amounts of $$ you will not be able to do anything as every aspect of this game is tailored to making non paying players (even those who originally paid for the game) heavily inferior to those whom are willing to pay.
3114	1	a	This game is the bomb! Must Must Must play
7171	0	a	It was a great game until they change the game. The server so laggy when they put the server together {west and east}. Building load slow, bad community and banned for no reason even if its 'skills'. I believe the banning is causing the game to be low population 'silver is now gold' from what i heard. I hope they fix the game ASAP or its gonna go POOF.
9751	1	a	Free verison of FallOut 3! Its awesome. :)
7461	0	a	I would not recommend this game. If you're not willing to cough up the money, then the game isn't that fun. As either a Criminal or an Enforcer, you get mauled by others before you even get a chance to try to learn how to play. If you're new, then no one wants you. For me, probably because of my location from the server, it lags. This has a big impact. If it lags even a tiny bit, and makes it so you can't aim straight, or drive the car correctly, let's just say, 'It's not fun.' So, unless you don't have any lag at all, you can pick up how to play in the first few minutes, and you're willing to cough up the cash or barely get anywhere, then all the luck to you.
6071	0	a	P2W Reloaded  P2W=Pay to win just in case you ask
4444	0	a	You know how when a horse breaks its leg, you're supposed to shoot it? Yeah, that was APB from the start. And then they tried to perform necromancy on it. But that didn't fix its broken leg. Now it's just rotting AND crippled.  Sure, you can dress your zombie horse up however you want. Give it a little hat. Try to pretend it's alive and well. But the truth remains; It's not. Every moment it exists is a plea to stop its unending torment.
8061	0	a	lol â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ this is â¥â¥â¥â¥
972	1	a	Recommended, ONLY if you got good to Great Internet speed and Good to Great amount of RAM.
9877	1	a	A decent post-apocalyptic MMO with a deep crafting system and a lot of content. Not really pay-to-win either. Definitely worth a try if the genre appeals to you or you want an MMO with something a little different to offer.
8810	0	a	the leaning system is crap beacuse you have to aim in order to lean and it goes into a over the shoulder POV witch is crap i feel like what would make this game better is if it was both 1st and 3rd POV
8392	0	a	This game is pretty awful. There is virtually no one on the servers. The game itself has a lot of unrealistic physics and gameplay is pretty choppy. The character creation menus are annoying and tedious to work with. Even the tutorial is boring and virtually helpless.. Not a fun game to play.
9677	0	a	Just terrrible. No real action what so ever, Nothing FUN to do at all, Its just another borring â¥â¥â¥ RTS like game. Very very very very very disapointed in it.
1026	1	a	really good game but you need really good wifi to make it work top noch id give the game 97-100

6922	0	a	The Pay2Win level of this game is just........ It can be played casually and without investing any money in it but then you would be at a huge disadvantage due to the fact that you have weapons that barely match theirs. I honestly tried to get to the max level....... But every time they updated the level cap would just increase, and the fact that you  rank up too slowly without the exp multiplier that the Premium players get just forced me to play this game for hours on end. I eventually stopped at rank 100+ The max rank is probably 235+ by now. The game's matchmaking system is purely unbalanced. If you're a bronze threat player.... You basically get treated like dirt and get matched up against goldies, and also.... The backup that you get usually doesn't match the power that the opposition has, unless of course you roll with a clan that's filled with 150+ ranked silvers and goldies. But then again, there are some actually decent people that actually have skill in playing this, it's just a bit sad that the community is just.........  But still, I would recommend it with friends, and also don't take this game too seriously
9693	0	a	Awful gameplay
674	1	a	Good game but u need to be smart to play
8822	0	a	It's a fun game however lacks updates and fixes. The map becomes boring after a few hours of playing, and is certainly pay to win.
7027	0	a	San Paro...A city in peril with its streets overrun with gang violence, all at the feet of the Evil Corporation, 'Gamersfirst'. Will you escape the clutches of poverty and take what isn't yours? Or will you be the few and proud to standup to this chaos? Are you ready to take the fight to the streets? Well don't, stay at home and dont spend any money on this game, all it does is make the Jews at Gamersfirst more powerful....
3187	1	a	awesome fun.Lots of players andd missions.customizing is amazing

3661	1	a	This Is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ING Good game
4618	0	a	I have played this game for 287 hours and honestly was one of the worst experiences i have had in gaming. From the ridiulous leveling system, to the quite frankly pay to win aspect of the entire game, i would honestly NEVER recommend this game to anyone.  The community can be extremely toxic and vulgar, with casual swearing and slurs in chat, just a small anoyance, but nevertheless.  The only good thing that this game has to it is playing with friends. The only possible way to beat the NUMBER of broken guns is by using a 3-4 person group on a single person. This might sound absurd, but unfortunately, this imbalance does exist.  The only reason why i have this amount of hours on the game is playing with friends, and the addiction that this game shoves down your throat, along with the 'you must pay to play this game evenly against your opponents' attitude.  Dissapointing that trash like this exists on steam.  EDIT: Grammar stuffs
134	1	a	At First become addictive, but at the end you get over it.
2193	1	a	OMG I Love this game. Best game. Just like GTA
2474	1	a	Difficult to get into, even as a vetern to shooters. Lots of customisation and tons of gameplay potential, ruined by the focus on payments and korean level grinding.  It's mainly an mmo and the limited player TDM is squashed by that fact.
5515	0	a	GTA 4 wannabe game without the polish- effectively just a turd. There litterally is no purpose in the game, microtransactions. Not worth the 10$ in bandwidth to download it!
8617	0	a	This game is a really good game but at the same times... its suck.... , Theres many hacker in this game....,I got ban for no reason... , 4 of my friend get ban for no reason.....and i spent over 400 usd on it and yet i got ban for no reason....i send ticket to gamefirst and they close my case...... :l
7516	0	a	I am very disappointed about this game, I was told this game had genitalia and it doesn't, shameful.
943	1	a	APB reload is a fun open world cop vs robbers game and yeah there is a few bugs here and there but over all a greatgame and yes you need a somwhat good computer to run but its woth it so go have fun
8661	0	a	UPDATE--9_7_2016 If you guys know by now the game now simply a PayToWin! I sorry G1, after i see what marketplace sale with useless and dumb equipment and other stuff, i have no choice to set this not recommend. You guys(G1) said going to update the engine, but for me, i suggestion move on! Meaning make new game,new APB, advance than GTA5 and MGS5, combine 2 into 1...  I hope one day someone made that happen!  --This is the preview review below when the game was great before, feel free to read what i felt if you willing to!--  For those who wanna step up into hardcore battle similar like COD and GTA stlye, here want you looking for!  Honestly i have few word of reason that recommend and not recommend for you guyz..So here me out then! Why i'm recommend?  This game have customize character, art design for clothing and cars and make cool music that the game provide the tool they have~  It was amazing how you can choose you own way depending what you like it.Well you can't make any art design and music of your own, why not buy other creativity stuff then. The gameplay was awesome just like gta but it most liking of COD battle stlye when health can regen itself if you take cover! And now, why i do not recommend?  1st, the game is hard.Few players that you will might encounter was a pro or averge that think themself they are the best but not and among of them might mock you or takedown many times when you about to learn how the game work.After that you might give up by the stress from them and play other game~  2nd, Some newbies give up this game easy,right?...Well some newbie might not giveup but will break the rule of the game.Yup! that right, other you will encounter is cheater and hacker that might ruining the game and your's fun times.  Lastly, well everyone already know that some server you enter is lagging. No matter where you choose, it will still lag.  Lagging might come if your internet slow, sometime is your grapfic card or memory ram not enough for the game to run it. But this year lagging alway be there wheather your pc low or high that another topic that ruining the game else well...but hopefully, next year i think, G1 try to fix the problem of lagging so hope is work.But if the next year didnt fix the problem, well it up to you guy to decide then.     Overall, the gameplay, customize character, design stuff is really awesome for me but sadly there might few downfall to it, so it 8.5 out the 10 for me.  The game very old now, so if the Game Creator planning to make 2nd installment with improvement gameplay most similar like Metal Gear Solid 5, i definintly want help out the character design then~ :D
9488	0	a	Very difficult to get your bearings set from the beginning. There isn't much of an in-game tutorial to help you ease into it. Quests seemed standard 'kill X of Y in zone Z' or 'gather/craft X of Y'. The combat system is crazy weird to me, and I cant even begin to describe the crafting system... The fact that its Post-Apoc wasteland is about the only thing this game has in common with Fallout. I feel as though the game HAS potential, but that alone doesnt merit a good game. Implementation and execution on things seemed lacking. I uninstalled without a second thought.  I didn't play it for long, so I speak on a very limited experience, but I still wouldn't suggest this mess of a game on anyone.
2529	1	a	awsome ame i know i spelled awesome rong but still oooowee whats with that whats up with that 
7632	0	a	Realy bad for new players as people have 2 many op weapons and you cant catch up
8827	0	a	This game never worked so â¥â¥â¥â¥ this
9520	0	a	This game is way to complicated to set up. - make a Gamersfirst account - give email and make a password - start game  When I started the game, it took me to a log in screen. It asked for a username (which it didn't have me make) so I thought, 'Maybe I just need to type my steam log in.' and I did that. It didn't work. I went onto the Gamersfirst website to see if they (for some reason) made the username for me. i would then change it to my liking. i get into the fallen Earth profile page and the username is a combo of numbers and letters and dashes. The number of tacks for the password was WAY off to the one I had created.   So unless you know what you are doing, save the headache and don't waste your time trying to download this.  (If I was only making it hard, tellme what I did wrong. Until then, I don't recommend this game)
5052	0	a	I thought I'd give this game a try after hearing about it via word of mouth.   One element that I love, is the character customization and being able to design unique outfits with the designer mode and the player/map interaction. I've only tried playing as a criminal character so far but honestly as a new player I've found it next to impossible to win gunfights and get kills, whether that's due to hackers or not I'm not sure because on numerous occaisions I've scored multiple hits on players and they haven't gone down, yet I get taken down almost every time with only a few shots.   It's not newbie friendly by any means and I'm pretty sure the matchmaking doesn't work at all, everyone I go up against seem to be much more experienced, their clothing designs are a giveaway since you get next to nothing early on. The game itself is also very laggy and vehicle controls are absolutely horrible &amp; unresponsive as vehicle steering also seems to be linked with mouse movement.  To summarize, it's not an enjoyable game for new players and is not one I'd consider spending any real money on since the developers don't seem to be all that engaged with the players, nor fixing obvious flaws with the game &amp; actively dealing with hackers IG.
4204	0	a	Its a decent game, with great content. but all of the weapons and vehicles are purchased for 1 day, 7 days, month, or permanent. Permanent costs real money or so much money it would take you weeks to months to afford a car. Game is a basic pay to win game, with content that requires ingame money that you can take FOREVER, or you can use real money to get what you want. If you have multiple friends that play this game, then investing is not a bad idea. GTA 5 is a newer version of a freeroam MMO, but lacks the content as APB/ customization.
2665	1	a	OMG GET THIS GAME BE CRIMINAL AND DO STUFF! ITS SOOOOOO AWESOME
7800	0	a	I remember when they announced this Game, i was very excited, i mean who wouldnt u could make a clan with your friends, run around the city on customed cars and clothes make gangs catch bad people. Ect. well the game didnt live to anyones expectatives, it started as a pay to play after a few months became free to play. enough said.
4312	0	a	its like GTA but with a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ier community and â¥â¥â¥â¥ controls
4310	0	a	it needs more stuff for the free to play players
9673	0	a	I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone who doesn't enjoy â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t that makes no sense. When loading up the game it requires you to make a login, get it verified and all that jazz, but when it comes right down to it, it literally makes no sense at all. There is no username, and if you go into your account, there is a username with a weird series of numbers and letters, and even when putting those in, it does not work, so for those who do not have half an hour to spend â¥â¥â¥â¥ing around just trying to figure out how to get into the game, it's not good.
3679	1	a	  this game much fun   
10185	1	a	Amazing game used to Co-run a clan of 300+ then took short break clan fell apart still think its my fault cause i left then all the other higher ups left as well. came back clan was dead want to play again just have noone to play with and solo/ random party raids get boring fast.
2425	1	a	Excellent Graphics, Interesting Concept, Hard to learn Gameplay. The gameplay for me is quite confusing and even after as much as I have played it, I mainly just get killed. I don't know if it just me but definitely give the game a try as it can be quite entertaining if you learn to play.
6397	0	a	One of the worst games ever made.
2454	1	a	This is like gta4 cops and robbers mode excpet you get to actually break into houses and customize your character
10608	1	a	This game â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sucks â¥â¥â¥ and â¥â¥â¥â¥. In order to have any fun in this game, you need to hit level 20 with your character, but the game does everything in it's power to stop you. â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t, that's what it is. When you die, YOU LOSE YOUR CHARACTER AND EVERYTHING YOU HAD, â¥â¥â¥â¥ING â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥T GAME! Even though you swear never to play this game again, you always come back for more and the same thing will happen, resulting in a endless cycle.   -10/10 would play again
9123	1	a	OMG! Guys if you like Post-Appocolyptic things then this is your game. It is so fun with real plays even though there is still NPC's and Mobs. It has missions to do and the XP to rank up to lvl 55! Now i know some people might say that, 'are you kidding? lvl 55 will take forever!' But seriously not, I've played this game for a month and got to lvl 55 and to do so all you have to do is kill loot and sell and get a good clan to get some new friends and hang out in the Wasteland. It has all kinds of cool looking armor and weapons but here ammo can become scarce sometimes if you dont watch how much u have. BUt anyway I would want all you appocolypse fans to play this it is realy worth the download.
4471	0	a	Deleted. I've tried to enjoy this so many times. But every time I play it just tends to make me really angry. The matchmaking, hacking, and the fact you cant leave a mission when your team mates aren't even playing was enough to finish it for me.   If they fix that stuff, I'd be interested in looking at it. Until they do, game over APB.
10104	1	a	For the short time I've been in game it didn't seem too bad, the other 7 hours were spent trying to load in or update.   
735	1	a	A nice third person shooter that pits two factions against eachother in mission-based PVP. One of GamersFirst's finest in my opinion. You can gain standing through completing missions for contacts and climbing up in the ranks. Earn guns, clothing, cars, and more as you increase your standing and move up in the city of San Paro. There are three districts, the Financial district, the Waterfront distrect, and the Social district. The Financial and Waterfront district are the two main districts that use the PVP system. The Social district is where people go to sell items on the in game marketplace, pimp out their character, or just hang out. Overall I think APB Reloaded is a great game and I recommend it to all.
2309	1	a	One of the greatest games i've ever played. People whine about pay2win, but that's only noobs and low lvls. At a higher level, that isn't even hard to obtain from just having fun and playing without paying anything, you will notice the free weapons you buy from apb$ is just as good as the ones you can purchase for real money.   Original apb 5/5 Reloaded 4/5 - Everything is nice, but the graphics engine is really messed up. But they will soon release a new one and i will start playing this game again.
4443	0	a	Recently hacks have been released again and the game is now dead every person a hacker. its hackers vs hackers. and now brazilians are allowed on NA SERVERS. but you know their â¥â¥â¥â¥ favela ping wont affect out gameplay ohhh nooo dont worry g1. but seriously i didnt think it could get any worse till i say that. download it to expericne raw footage of the highest scum. Peace.  I decided to give a little more insite to never download this game......   Alright. I got lovely info for the â¥â¥â¥â¥sticks who wanna play this game. you mind as well get your doctor to live with you in this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. got ltl camping double teamers hacking. oficially every person besides me hacks. Ik people who have just for the purpose decided to hack to see how many people actually wall hack. almost every person we faced was using aim bot. How badly could you â¥â¥â¥â¥ this gamers first. you dislexic or somthing? like your fairfight is actually â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t and works for â¥â¥â¥â¥. â¥â¥â¥â¥ the game. just wanted to take one little peek from playing it a while ago to see this even worse. people just hack cause other hack. you dumb â¥â¥â¥â¥ reatrds can easily fix the game but you wan tto sit on your â¥â¥â¥ and do â¥â¥â¥â¥. â¥â¥â¥â¥ Apb.  So ik somone who was banned technically by accident. so as he requested some support, they replied with this 'we will no longer receive emails from this account thank you'. so he spent like over 1000 dollars and he will never get it back. Also i was in game and i called this Gm out and asked him 'why did they do that to my friend'. he went silent and instead muted me for 3 days........ like??  You will often see people on these reviews saying they cant quit but they put a thumbs down like me. well just watch that south park episode when stan gets hooked on that free game app but spent thousands on it. Episode i think was called 'FREEMIUM' or somthing. Its basically that. ill urge anyone to not join this game. sure you win lots and you lose lots but when they ban a guy who â¥â¥â¥â¥ talks then gets banned the next day, but a hacker hacks for 6 months trigger bot and everything fully blatant hacker to get banned. idk you tell me.  Update 5 FINAL REVIEW UPDATE. Play to lose. â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ This game. Had a little kid yell at me on Voip and i said one thing and he ignored me. best experience yet.  So ik i have like posted these reviews so close together but the first few were over some time. Officially im no longer going to play this game till the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Developers make a new god dam sever to put the ultra try hard reroles out of the game. its no longer fun. like this game will ruin you. I beg you dont play please god let this game die and let the company go bankrupt please. All it is, is rerolles that when you died once they tea bag you just cause they camped around a corner. This game has lost me as a player. â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ you gamerfirst suck C-O-C-K. Listen to you players and maybe you wont continue to lose people to these no life 30 year olds with no jobs and on welfare. True story to people who do not play and mostly mexicans for some reason on north amaerican servers. Good day. And please take this into consideration, iv never played a game where the community will make fun of you just for saying 'i have not gotten a good team in a while' it was like i was in court and i had to fight if i was gonna die or not. these people were like completley smothering me like i was a mass offender. im a player. who will never again play this game till i see change. Good day. #killapb  Update 4. Officially the worst game now.  So i come on and all it is is max rank golds that are 30 year old men â¥â¥â¥â¥ talking and all they say is you bro salty man lmao dude salty â¥â¥â¥â¥ THE WORD SALTY â¥â¥â¥â¥ING â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ STOP USING THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING WORD. they say they are good and they have 30 000 hours on the game. like get a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing job. Sad. Die game just lay down in a dark hole and â¥â¥â¥â¥ing die.  Update 3.   I have 2 days off of work this monday and tusday and these no lifers play all â¥â¥â¥â¥ing day with shotguns like do they not have lives do they go to school or work or just sit on this game. This game is DONE this game is dead. DO NOT PLAY this game. you will want to shoot your self . all iut is is shotgunners that go back behind a wall and shoot over and over. like this guy i see him on 247 like he should be banned for how much he plays like honestly get a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing life. WORST GAME EVER 10/10. plus i play enforcers as myt main and the matches i was just put in was Max gold Max rank/level and my team was like level 50s and my like 200.(or whatever) like how is that okay Apb get your â¥â¥â¥â¥ together for â¥â¥â¥â¥ sakes.  Update 2. I have decided to change this game back to not reccommended due to the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ lagg and that if you start playing at night the ultra try hards come on. I just faced a group of 4 people with the bolt and attachments or cj3 and ect. At night there is no point in playing this game you will have no fun. i will no longer play after 8:30 cause all the 30 yo old dude come on with their whole team and go on team speak and like get this game so far up their â¥â¥â¥ they can smell it. DEVS****** PLEASE implement a god dam platnum rank so they ultra try hards can leave. ill be honest im deacent at the game but since im in gold i face th etop players all the time and they are max gold 10s. there should be another rank that is harder to get into but puts those super try hards out of these servers. yeah i could play on bronze servers but its too easy and gold is too hard. so what else is there to do. FAZE OUT THE TRY HARDS INTO A NEW SERVER******* i have told this to people on apb and eveyrone says this is a great idea. but devs will do nothing so. Not reccommended. Have a fun time with my â¥â¥â¥â¥ spelling. have a great day.   Update 1 .  After playing this game more i decided to change my review from no, to yes. due to the more experience you have in the game you start knowing whats good any whats not. its almost impossible to play on your own though as a begginer i will say that. but i met some people that were playing for a long time and joined them. I got to know more about the game and yes i did have some money dumped into my account. the game is still fun once you start getting things and i do enjoy that they give some promo codes away from time to time even if the things i get only last a while. The only thing i dont like is i guess that buying some of the things is a little expensive but thats what im just saying. i was going to buy one gun and it was on sale it was like 3000g1c or whatever and it came out to like 33$ to buy and i said forget that and didnt buy it for that reason. so buy it if you want a game to play and be ready to have a little frustration with some people who do buy op guns and you tempted to spend some as well. not saying the begginer gun is bad. it isnt if you know how to use it. There is lost of techniques.
188	1	a	Very fun to play with friends. Alone it's not as fun but still it is. Being a nice change to other Free 2 play MMOs. There were alot of bugs in the earlier version but they are mostly fixed. New patches and updates are coming so the game won't get boring for a while. The game looks good and even with minium settings
9413	0	a	It's â¥â¥â¥â¥.
6004	0	a	The game lags like crazy. The graphics in the game are way lower quality than showcased in the trailers. And also its impossible to find objsctives as there are no waypoint markers.
4941	0	a	well many hackers like in every game whit guns lol
5448	0	a	$20 says that when this game stops making money, we'll start to see a LOT of changes that should've been added, such as: -SIMPLE weapon balancing -A much more alive city -Cheater enorcement -More FREE customization options -LESS P2W features -Better Hit Detection -Loads of apolagies from the devs for being negligent re-re's
9935	1	a	An A-OK Post-Apoc MMORPG and believe me most Post-Apocs MMORPGs suck!
7265	0	a	Honestly, this game has gotten pretty good on PC, they are really working to improve the community by banning hackers, and releasing frequent updates on how the game development is going.  However I'm not going to talk about the PC version, I'm going to talk about the Xbone version which seems to be doing terrible as of this moment. I mostly want to talk about false bans but there are other issues I will address here as well.  First the game was super laggy and broken when released, which is to be expected. However it still frequently crashes and lags up pretty hard despite the 'fixes' they have released.  The community is â¥â¥â¥â¥, but that comes with territory.  So I personally don't play the xbone version, I'm pretty loaded on PC and I'd rather not start over. My girlfriend however, plays the game almost religously. The clan she is in is pretty huge in the community, and is well known for elite players who have way too much time on their hands. Recently however a rival clan started PAYING people (he admitted to it, the owner has a recording of it) to mass report members of the clan my girlfriend is in. Pretty much half the clan has gotten false bans at this point, and G1's only response is 'we don't issue false bans' even after posting said proof of false mass reports, they just ignored it. The man in question paying his clannies to false report, is sitting back, laughing, and bragging in social about how he's gotten an entire clan banned, and G1 STILL refuses to do anything about it.  This is beyond pathetic, some of these players have already put quite a bit of money into the game. So why would it bennefit them to mod their xbone, and hack in APB? Also why haven't they been console locked for modding console and 'detected' hacks yet?   Exactly, because there was no wrong-doings on the part of said clan, except they were rivals with another huge clan that just wanted them out of the picture, and G1 doesn't give a single â¥â¥â¥â¥ about what goes on in the community, only what they feel is right and wrong will be addressed.  SOOOOO, until they decide to start giving a â¥â¥â¥â¥ about the xbone, which a lot of players have now moved to, or started playing. I'm not putting another â¥â¥â¥â¥ing penny into this game.
9106	1	a	This game it cool and if you like post-apocalyptic game this is for you i playd it and i like it  have a nice day playing :3
6390	0	a	This game is a huge money grab.
163	1	a	Always fun and really cool TRY IT
7588	0	a	Lags All The Time Even With My Monster Computer.
9950	1	a	Fun when u know how to do it .. :))))
4912	0	a	Before I re-installed the game through Steam I had been playing APB for more than 2 years. What caught my attention to the game, apart from the fast paced shooter mechanics, was the mind-blowing amount of customization, encompassing character, clothes, tattoos, cars, death themes, etc. This is, I think, the unique selling point of the game, as I haven't seen something so broad in terms of customization in any other F2P game. Some of the holiday events made by the devs were genuinely brilliant and my liking of the game eventually got me to spend some money to support the devs so they could fix the server issues, lagging, etc. Sure, since Day 1 one of my biggest issues with the game has been the considerable amount of toxicity, but then again the developers are not to blame. Oh, and the occasional hackers too... oh dear. But whatever, I loved APB.  Then the Fire Natio- sorry, the Server Merge happened (supposed to fix the lag).  For crying out loud, what happened?! More lagging!?  It's disappointing to see that most of the server issues, weapon balancing, severe lag, (add any other claim made by the players) haven't been resolved and instead G1 has focused on releasing re-skins of weapons in their insanely expensive Cash Shops. Now I am partially kicking myself for having spent money on the game, but I really hope that the devs can turn this game around and actually listen to the players for a change. Until then I'll keep playing APB (I spent a good amount of money in the game, so I might as well continue even if it pains me).
423	1	a	Played this game alot, the game has alot of potential and is alot of fun, but the admins arent too sure of what they are doing :/  10 outta 10
7889	0	a	Tried jumping back into the game but got error after error after error trying to log in and play.  Don't know what you guys are doing but something this buggy should not be present in a 3-4 (?) year old game.
3141	1	a	This is an overall great game with all its fun.
5956	0	a	Complete Pay to win game. dont even bother
10292	1	a	This game is sorta like the fallout series, but some very noticeable differences. you can create items from raw materials, which range from simple farming(actual farming, you know, with veggies and stuff) to badass looking vehicles (along with weapons) there are several tradeskills, such as construction, armorcraft and ballistics, skills such as, intelligence, perception etc. to level up and to benefit your playstyle, there is an auction to sell off on the worldwide auction to the highest bidder, the story is very interesting in my opinion, seeing that you are a clone that never truly stays dead. there are quests to complete, items to craft, enemies, including bosses to fight and several sectors to explore. i highly recommend this game if you are a fan of mmorpg's and post apocalyptic gaming
8907	1	a	Fallen earth really was a surprise for me. Ive been playing for around a year now on the standard client and I can't say enough about this game. Switching over to steam client version was perfect for sharing moments with friends. I am really having a blast playing it right now. Steep learning curve keeps a lot of the 'usual' mmo crowd out. This I like! Huge open sandbox world. Think I read over 5,500 quests and 11,000 square miles of area? MASSIVE!  The game has some amazing developers under its wing too. They are trying to improve the game daily with small updates, bug fixes and is one of the minor few games which takes community thoughts and feelings into persepctive.  Great community and if you get stuck or need a friend to help there are help chats, auctions, private chats &amp; town chats (In-game!)  Class-less characters to play as you wish and 6 factions and the factions are not all against each other but have their enemies, arch enemy, and allies among those 6. The character design feature is superb also! Very open and user friendly.  The graphics and model designs are not the best in quality terms but its not about the graphics on Fallen earth. The quests and community is the main focus in my opnion; which is great! Got a nice mix of PvE and PvP. PvP in certain areas as well as conflict towns in the higher zones.  Concluding, Fallen Earth is a great game if you have a varied lifestyle with a couple of hours every week to login and play. System specs are a little high but this keeps the younger generations away, A more adult style game.   Worth a try! (4 Stars)

8135	0	a	Hackerfest and the absolute definition of pay to win...steer clear of this game the best you can. The company is absolutely horrible and cares nothing about their customers. They rip people off on a usual basis and are pro-cheater as they consider cheaters paying customers. Additionally, the servers are very shoddy and lag on a fairly consistent basis.
6286	0	a	waste of space!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i cant even start the game. i have to download a bunch of 3rd party crap. my adivce? stick to GTA
6428	0	a	I bought this game on it's original release when Realtime Worlds developed it. It had a good concept but they didn't handle it well, hackers took over and eventually the lack of profit helped Realtime Worlds collapse. It lasted about 2 months until it was shut down.  Moving along it was taken over by Gamersfirst and, believe it or not, they managed to make things even worse.  It's still a hackers paradise ... but now with a ridiculous cash shop.   It's a shame, the concept is still great and the customisation is still fantastic but it's still being handled badly.
2153	1	a	Great co-op Grand Theft Auto. But bloody hardware requirements... :(
4644	0	a	This game is miserable.   The gameplay itself is decent, playing as a poor man's GTA Online (years before GTA had online). The customization is second to none. The amount of options you have for clothing, tattoos, decals, car paintjobs, and spray tags are limited only by your imagination (and subscriber level). If this was simply a graphic design sim, it would be the best around.  Unfortunately, it is an online shooter. It is in this aspect that the game fails horribly. The matchmaking is either insane or non-existant. The game ranks your skill in four levels: green, bronze, silver, and gold. You will come out of the tutorial as a bronze or silver, and be immediatly pitted against gold players that are maxed on rank. You will look at your own team and see another bronze, two silver, and an enemy team of five gold players. Now, the fact that they are max rank does not confer any actual bonuses on them (aside from weapon mods to slot into their weapons), but it does show a blatant lack of balancing.  This game is also infested with lag. All those customization options from earlier? It takes awhile for all of those to load in when the action gets hot and heavy. Expect frequent pop-up while driving, and cars that will seemingly continue to drive themselves after you hit the brakes. Ending the game does not end the lag either. About 25-50% of the time you exit the game, it will continue to run the process in the background. Meaning to fully close the game, you will have to ctrl+alt+del and kill the process manually. This game lags so badly, it can even lag you out when you are not in-game anymore.  The weapon purchasing system is a bit of a pain as well. You start with a generic assault rifle and pistol, and need to lease any other guns you wish to use. This gun will be available for the next nine days, after which point you will need to re-lease it again. If you do not feel like grinding through the ranks, you can spend cash in the shop to lease unlocked guns, as well as some guns that have mods that are not available with game currency. This leads to pay2win guns that are simply better than the guns you can unlock through playtime with game cash. It is important to note that even the real cash guns are not bought, they are returned at the end of the lease and must be purchased again with more real life money.  The community is a mixed bag. You have ultra-creative people selling outfits, tattoos, cars, and paint jobs that look like professional designers made them. Then you have the usual toxic shooter crowd in the other districts. There will be lots of griefing, whispers of hackusations, and you will be sworn at in practically every language on Earth. It is very easy to fill your ignore list up in two weeks of play, leading to needing to delete past offenders off the list. Since the game is rated-M, there are no limits to what you can say or display on the boards. Expect to see â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, swastikas, and other unpleasant things sprayed on walls throughout the city. This game is truely a troll's paradise.  Pros: - character customization - vehicle customization - creative community  Cons: - matchmaking - performance - business model - toxic community
8158	0	a	game needs balance. ex) every bronze sever in high levelers. the goldgun code is spread. aim haker in game.  and sever is insecurity. ex) sever shutdown without notice to steam users. asia users only have high ping(150ms+).  
3241	1	a	When I first started playing APB few months ago I wouldn't have recommended it as it was a lot of gold tier players stomping me every mission but they have added new match making which has me playing against other silvers and I'm actually having fun. The combat in this game is very fast paced like GTA 2 or 3 in fact specific weapon types are made to run and gun rather then usual iron sight shooting I'm used to. The cars are also realy fun to drive around and the physics of crashing them together can be hilarious at times especially with the heavier vehicles.   I should note that if you don't have the paid subscription (premium) that the very very good clothing/tattoo/body modifications are severely limited to the point where you will won't get the crazy details you see in most screenshots. The same applies to cars though even with subscription it is still much more limited then player models.  The game is free to play so you have nothing to lose to just jump in and run over and or shoot people to see if it's something you can play for a while there's no hidden pay wall or 'pay 2 win' though they do sell guns and some are a lot easier to use then the default weapon but skill plays a lot into it.
1131	1	a	This game is not for filthy casuals. It needs a good amont of time to 'git rly gud' at it.
9400	0	a	IDFK what to say. Lets just say like all f2p games. I stop playing after a few days, but this game? Only lasted three hours before I said ' I am bored, â¥â¥â¥â¥ it time for Fallout 3.' Also don't even buy anything from this game, no. Just save that money and buy the entire Fallout series. You won't regret it. This is just a â¥â¥â¥â¥ online version of Fallout 1,2,3, and NV.
4818	0	a	The only good thing about this game is the amount of Character/Vehicle customization.
8894	0	a	OMG This game had the potential to be great, not good but GREAT! As usual they are out for money, but they don't care about their customers. Features are there but due to the bugs are unusable and do not get fixed. The customer service either is incompetant or just unwilling to help with some issues and that makes the game not worth anyone's money let alone time. The crafting is good except for the time to craft gets very bad. Grouping and their maping system is terribly executed and still not fixed. MOBs are everywhere including areas that do not need it but in areas you would expect it, it is empty. it is a game that you can play and reach max level really quick if you want. No real story and some quests are terrible while others are set perfectly without any rhyme or reason. Tradeskills are about 90% to where they need to be but better than most other games out there. Storage is okay but needs more upgradablity.Help channel is okay but don't bother trying to talk to the GMs about anything because they really don't care and would rather help their friends not you.
10155	1	a	great rpg if you love fallout
7453	0	a	The only fun this game is for screwing around on a terrible gta clone.

9654	0	a	This game seems like it would be cool, but i cant get past the first part because the game crashes after i kill the first guy. When i go to options to turn graphics down, it immediantly glitches and closes the option menu out. Take my first experience with the game in consideration when you try to get it. Otherwise, it looks like it would be cool.....if it didnt crash every five seconds.
7526	0	a	Pros:  - Fun Gunplay (to a certain extent)  - Extremely indepth customization.  Cons:  - Balancing issues (Certain guns can 1/2 shot lower level vehicles.)  - Terrible Matchmaking system. (Someone with &lt;1 hour of gameplay can get matched with someone of &gt;3000 hours.)  - Server Issues  
509	1	a	This game is gay 
3822	0	a	This game was really a blast. The best part was when I got really high level were everyone had an aimbot or threw around $4,000 dollars to the developers to get really overpowered sniper rifles and machine guns. If you are not willing to buy the $500 dollar guns then you cant have fun in this game.
5512	0	a	kinnda like gta but with more customization
1145	1	a	You can become a gang member in this game.
368	1	a	Hmmm. It's a Solid game. However... there a couple of things that disturb me. For instance, high level players on a certain level get access to what we would call a Rocket Launcher. And this gives them godly powers. If you have to battle against a high level like that you're doomed. Its so overpowered. Some weapons are overpowered aswell, it's not like really balanced.   However, im glad this game is not Pay2Win, you can pay for extra options like cars and stuff but its really like a short cut. If you play long enough you will get access to that gear aswell sooner or later.   Finally i want to mention how wonderful the customization is though. I wish more games had such awesome custonization. Because, you can customize all your clothes, guns, cars, tag and much, much more!  UPDATE [24-05-2013] APB is the Most Hateful community i know on the internet. You can't go around, playing, for 1 hour without getting called extremely bad names, cussing, rage or false accusations.   On top of that its full of cheaters with aimbots and wallhacks. Reloaded Productions however doesn't make ANY effort to punish these people. And the updates they are bringing lately are Sad, repetitive and overpriced. â¥â¥â¥â¥ you APB!
2672	1	a	the best

1985	1	a	is a good apg game 2ond opticks but the bullet damage is the same on the headshot and the body . thats all i have to say
9965	0	a	you should probably make sure your game doesnt lag to hell when you look at an entity... especially when a large bulk of the game is combat oriented. im not wipinng myself with this game unless they fix the lag issue. its bad enough that they make the player wait for a dogs age waiting for updates and a million agreements. if the lag wasnt a problem however it would be pretty good.
4949	0	a	the matchmaking system is bad the higer level players are often placed with low lovel players me my self am a low level bronze player and i often get placed with gold players. can the game develepers please fix the matchmaking system plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

3089	1	a	Not enough guinea pigs
9925	1	a	only made it to lvl ten, but so far it is a fun game to play. Plus its free can't beat that.
3943	0	a	This game used to be awesome. Keywords are 'used to'. Now it's just a circlejerk of hackers, rerollers - experienced players who make new characters 'cos can, troll characters - characters that are meant to look as hideous as possible, and a company that does a really poor job of not only getting rid of the hackers - they usually just ban innocent players - but making the game run well. It runs on an outdated engine and is poorly optimized. I have state-of-the-art hardware in my computer, and even with the graphics turned up to the fullest there is still aliasing, texture and animation problems. The company who owns this game, GamersFirst - they didn't make the game, but instead revived it from the company who originally created the game but had to shut down for some reason, can't even make good content for the game. The last, like, four weapons they've added have been reskins of existing weapons. But these ones you can only get by spending REAL MONEY to get, and it's not cheap either. Permenant weapons for a single character are forty dollars. FORTY DOLLARS. I could buy a completely new game with that.  The thing this game does well at is the customization, my God is it amazing... Only if you are a wizard at making symbols; otherwise you look absolutely stupid. The designers for symbols and themes - you can make a five second tune, usually an ear-piercing screech, that someone hears when you kill them or become MVP - aren't the most user friendly, and because of that there are only a handfull of people who can decently make them.  The gameplay is really repetitive and grindy; do the objectives and shoot the bad guys. The objectives don't mean crap, though. You can do all the objectives, but if you don't kill anyone you get barely anything. You level up at a snail's pace unless you, or course, spend REAL MONEY to get Premium, which allows you to get insane bonuses - something like 200% - to money and experience incomes.   I started playing this game right around the time it came out, and it was fun for a while, but for the past year the only thing that has kept me playing is the hope that GamersFirst would do SOMETHING to fix this crap-heap of a game. I would not reccomend you play it. If you do play it, however, do NOT spend any money on this game - it's dying, and fast.
9941	0	a	Boring and mediocre.
9906	1	a	Pretty fun, takes a bit longer to level up with spending money, but all in all still a pretty fun game!!!!
1240	1	a	It`s a good game when you play ,why,it`s very simple i know it lag a little bit but , it gives you personage customesation it`s multyplayer , have good graphics good bullet effect ... etc and i like it
1494	1	a	8 Hours gameplay, 40 hours downloading. GG
6145	0	a	Noob game, so many hackers and they aren't banned, â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game -.- Unistalling now
4278	0	a	There wasn't a game my old computer couldn't run. There wasn't a game it could run well, either. I could have bought the highest end graphic intensive game that existed, and it would still atleast /run/ at the minimum, sure, I wouldn't probably see a frame past the first, but it wouldn't crash and it most definitely would run everything. This, however, is an exception. This said that 'This computer couldn't run this' which was a first for me. It should atleast let you play the game even if you aren't optimized to.
8583	0	a	Alright game but most of this is pay to win.
7497	0	a	They make the game look amazing in the preview, but once you play the game it sucks, there are never any cops and never enough people to play with
4025	0	a	3 years ago probably one of the best games out there. NOW probably the worse one you can play if you play it for the shooting aspect. THE BAD #1 Get good with carbin or lose #2 Premium or die of old age #3 VERY toxic community (salty,tears,getgud,â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥) typical vocabulary amongst #4 Porn #5 Animation canclation a thing #6 Seeing through certain walls (not fixed over years) #7 Unjust bans #8 cheat scripters not being banned? #9 very very lacking on updates #10 The more money you got (real cash) the more youl succeed -spent alot - notices difference   THE GOOD #1 Amazing customization #2 Good game to hang out with people #3 Car customization/Driving is awesome Thats it i give this game a big thumbs down - about 8K hours of game play over the past 5 6 years WORTH IT back then NOT WORTH it now .
1701	1	a	One of the best games i have played in a long time, 9/10!
7263	0	a	It was good,it's bad now.
4096	0	a	This game is good, but we want to costum must buy -_-
6061	0	a	- Game is exploitable and allows you to win simply because you utilized the dirtiest tricks. The rage when doing this is gold, though. - Matchmaking sucks. Time to take out the stun guns. - Weapon balance sucks. Just use OP weapons all day, every day. Bam. Win streaks. - The servers are so bad, combat looks like a DB:Z fight. - The game will lag no matter how good your PC is. - There's like 100,000 players that play around 2 - 3 days a week, and 15,000 that play over 3 days a week. 1,200 of those are cheating. - You would be better off selling your soul to Satan.
6407	0	a	I have 2,000 hours on this game, I played it without Steam until 6 months ago.  This game is 'okay', but seriously, don't play it. I can't stop playing it, but for those interested, stay away.
1268	1	a	Pretty good game idk why u guys are so mean like yea it crashes it makes you play more, i dont feel like it makes me play forever im not so good at designs but i like it!!! 9/10
1850	1	a	its good but matchmaking is a bit bad :/
5640	0	a	gta multiplayers worst copy :(
670	1	a	best game u will ever play
9024	1	a	This is the MMO that I keep coming back to. If you want crafting, questing and sandbox, some would say one cannot go with the other, but it works here. There is also farming, pvp, only in certain spots, but those spots are rich with resources, so there is no griefing the noobs. Also the community is pretty good and the Help channel actually helps. To top it off players moderate the chat and I have seen the ban hammer come down more than once. Yes the interface is clunky, yes the graphics are not AAA, but I love this game and it gives me a sense of accomplishment when I can go out, gather stuff and make myself a shirt. Although its F2P i have played with and without subs and I have not really seen a differance. But for $10 a month you cant go wrong.
716	1	a	if you dont have the money for gta than git this it is so goooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
5466	0	a	wont even â¥â¥â¥â¥ing work and its forcing me to like a facebook page and then says app is running.
4150	0	a	Its like a frog.  It croaks, then totally derps and and falls into the water, drowning itself in the process.  Black screen.  1/10
3457	1	a	Very fun game. I personally enjoy it, just being a cop is a bit harder of a job. I don't like the long loading screens, but of course, that depends on your PC.  Over all, very fun and good. Definetly check it out!
7983	0	a	This game blows! Don't know where to start. No solid tutorial, just kinda of throws you in the action and has a little pop up telling you to do something, but without telling you how to do said item. Also while you're running around trying to figure out what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ your supposed to be doing. Players with far more experience are also in the same area trolling the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of you. Game is definitly Pay-2-Win with the in-game store being packed full of more powerful guns and faster cars. Honestly not worth spending any real money on. Played for a couple of hours and uninstalled it. Best of luck to everyone who keeps playing but you won't be seeing me.
8316	0	a	Low population. Like any games that are dying, only the pros @ hackers are left. Sad.
8889	1	a	Fallen Earth. A game based on around the Apocalypse in the year 2156. It's a cool concept and was definately in its own league when it was averaging in the thousands for players on daily login a few years ago.  'Is this game like Fallout?' No, they share the same genre. Nothing more. Fallen Earth tops Fallout when it comes to roleplaying and exploration. I've been playing this game for 6 years, I've still only achieved 25% of the achievements on Steam and still haven't found all the tourist spots.   'Is the game dead?' Compared to its prime? Yes. I'd prefer the term 'quiet' there's still a large number of people playing Fallen Earth in areas all over the game world. If anything, it adds to the genre of it being a post apocalyptic game with players being few and far between.  This game is heavily based around crafting, as such the in game economy is subject to amazing highs and devastating lows. Inflation sets in, items you farmed for hours are worth nothing and that one item you kept hold of is worth a small fortune. Give or take a certain length of time it returns back to normal.  The controls in this game leave a lot to be desired, it doesn't compare to your up to date MMORPG currently on the market, but that is not where this game is a powerhouse. It's not in PvP either.  So what has this game got, that all other games on the market seem to lack? A social community. Fallen Earth was and is full of players who have roleplayed with one another and had a blast, those who have made clans numbering in the thousands for membership and those who organise fairs for everyone in the game to attend.   So should you play this game? Yes. Don't expect the game to blow you away. The game is what you make it and for me it is not only a game that has allowed me to meet so many good people but also blow me away whenever I come back to it.   The only way for us to get this game worked on again is to get enough players to come back so they will realised Fallen Earth should not be abandoned. The potential here is massive. Lets not waste it.
4785	0	a	this game is a typical pay to win with guns that are immensely overpowered from the in game purchases
3202	1	a	It's a good game.
2004	1	a	Not bad at all.... Kinda boring at beginning, but Nice Game, thats all ; )
1007	1	a	i have played this game like for a 1000 hours and still loving this game so i invite you to play it...
2276	1	a	Its a fun time kill, some aspects are a little clunky but not hard to overlook. Customization is fun
2647	1	a	It's from one of the designers of Grand Theft Auto. So think of it like that. But better, because this is not a serious game in any way. It's all about fun, and it is. I love the customization-- crazy stuff!
10729	1	a	this is a really good game with coop with your friends and slaying anything and everything together is really cool
6630	0	a	APB:reloaded.... i simply dont like this game, everything, EXACTLY everithing MUST BE PAY2WIN, also the missions are bad. this is my personal opinion btw... if you like open world but hate p2w (pay2win) then simply dont download this game.
10776	1	a	yes its so great i luv it
5571	0	a	Cant play it sad face WINDOW 7 BALL â¥â¥â¥â¥
4470	0	a	It has been a while since I played, it used to be a fun game, but I was tired of lag on here due to the tech people not knowing what the hell they were doing and screwing it up more and more with each update. I was going to try it again as my brother had convinced me to play because they fixed all those issues. However, after 11 and a half hours of downtime today, far past the original estimate they gave, and with them expecting another 3 hours on top of this, I can clearly see that the programmers still cannot program properly and I feel I must give up on this game again before I was even able to give it a second chance.   Update: So I finally get to try this again... only logs me in every other attempt.. game decides not to render my enemies till there is already a bullet in my head... oh, and I absolutly LOVE having to wait for 5 minutes after closing the game to get control of my computer back. So in conclusion, it is still broken, the programmers obviously still don't know what the hell they are doing, and I'm done with it. Not worth the headaches that come with it. Such a shame, waste of a decent idea and semi decent gameplay. But that's what most free to play is, great idea smashed to â¥â¥â¥â¥ in practice.
5730	0	a	ok ever since i started playing and realtime worlds went bankrupt and you guys took over there has been constant server problems the same dam issue has been going on for months and you guys dont seem to give a â¥â¥â¥â¥. this would be a good game if you people would just fix these dam issues. obviously the servers this game is on now cant handle the â¥â¥â¥â¥ so maybe you should switch the â¥â¥â¥â¥ over or something. tired of paying for for this game i feel like im just wasting it making money of of us yet you guys dont want to take the time to fix these problems. so as of now my rate is pretty dam bad if you tell me. you guys dont deserve a good review at all.
5479	0	a	glitched my account
3990	0	a	It's not a bad game, but it's anything but good. The driving is annoying, the gunplay is nothing spectacular, and the AI is crappy (this is the best word I can think to describe it as).  All this is a pay-to-win mediocre cop vs robber game that's not really all that fun and could really use some major fixes and fine-tuning to mechanics.  However, because it is free, give it a try and see for yourself - some people actually enjoy these kind of shooters, so you might as well. 5/10
3592	1	a	You either like it or hate it... Try it for yourself and youll get what i mean
4320	0	a	Used to be fun back at the day but let's have a review shall we? No? Well go â¥â¥â¥â¥ yourself. This game used to be the best back when it came out. It's like GTA but free version and pay to win version. As you spawn... you look ugly af and ugly â¥â¥â¥ car. Not even a car! Just steal one. But then you see other people with awesome â¥â¥â¥ guns, cars, outfits. Can't do â¥â¥â¥â¥ pretty much. Well... dissapointed..
5248	0	a	I want my 2 hours back ! car driving 0/10 guns 3/10 graphics 4/10 pay2win cheaters everywhere please don't download this game...I repeat do not download this game ! do you copy ?
8891	1	a	how can a planet fall
2691	1	a	Awesome cops and robbers style gameplay that pits criminals against enforcers. Crims get to ram-raid shops for quick cash and Enforcers get to use 'less than lethal' (LTL) weapons to bring an enemy in alive by arresting them for more points and cash, along with 'witnessing' crimes by pressing ALT on a criminal commiting a crime in order to get a bounts mission on them.  Overall a great game with tons of customization options and a wide variety of weapons.  A solid third person shooter with a solid style.  9/10 [Mersey seal of approval.]
93	1	a	APB is a great game though it has a toxic community that might deter new players. It's a milestone for customization in games. You can cuztomize any part of your character (height, weight, muscularity, freckles, hair) you can make your own symbols to use on clothes and tattoos and cars. You can cuztomize your car with kits, symbols, upgrades, paint jobs, etc. The player can also cuztomize their weapons with skins and upgrades. Most of my time is spent socializing, driving, and designing then showing off my clothes. I highly recommend it to anyone with a creative mind.
8103	0	a	Avoid this game like the plague. The shooting mechanics are horrible, and the objective fighting is bland. For something that shouts out MMO GTA it just feels empty as hell, with the largest battle I had being two versus two. SHIITTTTT
3792	0	a	The #1 worst thing about this game isn't the devs, it isn't the cheaters, it isn't the performance. It's the community.
2394	1	a	It's best Game...download and play it.  It's Funny xD  E na figata scaricalo e provalo

6560	0	a	This game is plauged with problems, from cashshop guns/overpowered guns, to match making issues, a cancer player base, to cheating, and basically zero new content while the content they have is broken.  Don't even install it.
4069	0	a	This game is a great concept that was executed by a horrible dev team.  First and foremost, this game is largely an FPS game; every mission boils down to a gunfight so you need guns to shoot where you're aiming, unfortunatly for APB the dev's decided to use random spread patterns for the guns. What does this mean? It means your gun will sometimes shoot straight, sometimes not, it's about 50/50. Even though the game does have a smidge of recoil, managing it does not increase accuracy or spread at all. On this fact alone you should not play this game, then throw in all the 'Pay2Win' weapons, horrendous server 'rubber-banding' (aka. lag spikes every 5 minutes), and this game becomes horribly broken and unbalanced.  As far as 'shooter' games go, stay far away from Gamers First, they are very incapable of utilizing common sense when create such genre of games.
6197	0	a	too many hackers and cheats the game is rather pointless and greatly unplayable because of this and the free to play is hugely limited and again pointless. I would rather put my money into a single player game before putting a dime into a cheater run disappointment like this. only thing thats worse than the world full of cheaters in this is the pathetic company that makes it impossibl to do anything about them, but then again why would they the cheaters are the ones giving them cash so like NFSW they will pander to the cheats as usual.

8282	0	a	IT was an ok game until i started getting killed by the same person over and over agian pz fix this to where if you get killed killed so many times that it activates the heild i would reconmend this game if you just fixed it
349	1	a	fun game to play whit friend's it's a mmorpg and you are alway's online.. awesome
7870	0	a	Good idea, bad execution. It was interesting at first having a GTA clone MMO but it was ultimately really boring with not a lot to do. To top it off, you only get a few days with a certain gun that you purchased with in-game currency, first time I saw that in a game and didnât like it.
1472	1	a	Give it a chance,dont write bad reviews about it if you play for 1 hour  *Please fix the achivements in steam,they are bugged*
5748	0	a	This game is full of tricks to steal your money. They have the least balanced game I've ever seen. The game is far from realistic taking way to many shots to kill, and having way to much muzzle rise. If you're after a not so serious game, this might be fun with some friends if you're just driving your vehicles around like crazy, but it gets old fast. This game pretty much sucks all around...
137	1	a	played it for a bit..it was fun
4271	0	a	Had a lot of bugs, was hoping it would be similar to GTA or another open world game, I weas disapointed. It was very hard to move, very buggy, and laggy. Was not impressed with this game. 
3256	1	a	Spawned in my friend Mr Super Swag Money picked me up in this grey van and we drove around the hole city in the van running into shops and stealing tv's. 9,5/10 pretty fun game.

466	1	a	good game its a mix of gta and saints row in one free to play game
2719	1	a	I love this game. I have played it for years. It's all pvp which keeps the game fresh mission to mission. The character, vehicle, and weapon customizations are awesome. My only suggestion is they should have cooler weapons and upgrades as awards for fight club. My biggest complaint is regulating people who use cheat mods...Gamersfirst has gotten better about it but there shouldn't be an ability to have them.
5273	0	a	A waste of time and money.....  I played this game originally... Just after it launched as a F2P release. Spent around $35USD to unlock some premium gear.  Took a break for a while due to life intervention, work, work, work, etc.  9 months (and change) later.... The game is crap, driving mechanics are worse than EVER, and the overall gameplay mechanics are utter JUNK!  Keep away from this turd, its stench will just make you vomit all over your keyboard.
3243	1	a	Ok. So you like grand theft auto? Do you like MMO's? Cause if so, this Free-to-play game is a fun one. Its a very skillful game is a lot of fun to play. Now with all F2P games, there is a paying part to it. But listen to me, the paying to win part is not that bad as other games. In this game, for most paying purposes, it would give that SAID player a Advantage to OTHER players. In this game, I like to think of it as the COC iOS game. You can do it all legit, or you can pay for shortcuts. Those guys who kill you and seem so good? Its cause they have 1000 hrs+ alts and have spent ACCOUNT PREMIUM stuff. Now if you start out BRAND new, you will have Abosoutly have no idea what your doing, but it does have a VERY rewarding tutorial. Anyway The real P2W part about this game is the PREMIUM. Yes just Premium. This 'Premium' is alot more powerful than people think. This P2W aspect makes you make your normal cash, normal contact XP (XP) and THEN, the EXACT same amount with a 50% increase added to it. so in all, its like your getting a 150% increase in your stuff. Anyway, enough rambling, this is a VERY good game, giving people free Codes to enter and enjoy some of the P2W stuff. Now this is the kind of game that you either like or dont, but there are so really dumb aspects to it. Anyway, overall Good game. The P2W's and Smurfs (CS:GO Lingo meaning alters) kind of make it hard to join in. But this game is very skillful and, if you get some friends, its ALOT of fun.   ------Stay Awsome-----

5287	0	a	it sucked i didn't even get to play it. it took five ****ing days to install it and then 2 more days to ATTEMPT to make an acount. DON'T attempt to download this wast of electronic space &gt;:(
23	1	a	I did not spend that much time.   (Update) I have now realized this game has been causing me a great amount of stress. This game is exactly why my wooden chair i would sit in won't stand on its legs anymore.
6626	0	a	The idea was good, but the world feels to small, the way people misuse the system, even without hacking/cheating, just makes the game bad.
5772	0	a	Bugs, trolls, unbalanced combat and a general pain in the â¥â¥â¥â¥.
8152	0	a	WOW, You name the hack, here it is.. shocking amount of cheating, And high lvl VIP coming into servers just to blow you away Most likley because they are bored!! I gave it every chance and tried to ignore the warning`s posted by other`s and give this a go..OMFG!! be warned DO NOT DO THE SAME.. I promise you, I deplore you not to download this game.. Unless you have every intent on hacking like most in this game.. then join with your hacking brothers!! Such a shame has great potential, But clearly made to make a few quid and close this one down like they did the first!! Cant give this a lower thumbs down if i tried 100% thumbs down!!
4637	0	a	not interesting game,the missions are stupid...
2731	1	a	I can describe this game in two words ' APB Reloaded ' now play it.
2459	1	a	Not sure if I can say yes or no to this game. Full of griefers, full of rude people but so damn addictive... Just one more mission all the time.. I've been up all night on this. Gameplay incredibly unbalanced for PvP but still addictive. I have both criminal and enforcer. I probably spend more time in the designer than the game.  The intro movie makes you want to play it... the really crap player matching makes you want to throw your pc out the window. Too much microtransactions IMO but I have blown Â£100 on it so far just to have a few cool bits... its no different than subbing WoW for 10 months so why not. Its worth a shot if you HAVE THE PATIENCE and don't care about losing so some tool who has a grenade launcher in a n00b mission.
2706	1	a	Its like cookies, sweet and sometimes bitter
8047	0	a	My main game to play, loved the customization, but have to say that it is pay to win, also lot of hackers / cheaters , and nobody cares.. so i canÂ´t reccomend this game sorry
3067	1	a	Closest game to gta I have ever had   9 out of 10
948	1	a	If you want a good free game, this game is for you!!!
8440	0	a	'Gamers First' Love the name, but you got it all wrong, its money first remember? or thats atleast all you show.
5336	0	a	Spent 2 hours, editing my car, would have been more time wasted, if I didn't attempted to save my car. Realised that there was too many decals, because I had a 'free account', didn't let me save it. Mediocre gameplay, shiÑÑy guidelines and rules. Do me a favor and never play this shiÑ, don't even eyeball it, what ever you're looking for, in the Steam Store, this isn't it.
2820	1	a	All Points Bulletin, or APB for short.....what to say? It's a 50/50 with me,   This is a great free-roam game, and the ability to make your own character is good. all the different vehicles you have to choose from are great, and the fine details on everything is nice to see.  However, there are problems (still decent for a free game). First thing being that you don't own any of the guns unless you go to Armas (and pay their BS prices), which could very well ruin your experience in the game; seeing as they don't know how weapon-fairness works. If you don't have a premium account, then you're limited in EVERYTHING (so don't go thinking big with those decals and clothing designs). While you're driving you might also experience this funny lag where your commands are a little late and you end up smashing into something.  Don't get me wrong, I like this game alot. Just don't go in with high expectations or you will be disappointed
2249	1	a	best free to play game ever
575	1	a	APB Reloaded is an awesome game that gives you the chance to play GTA free :D
2657	1	a	Really addictive high octane 3rd person shooter reloaded with adrenaline shots on every single mission. Huge cities, nice environment, pimped cars, cool music, extreme customization options, tactical missions, good people, good fights. Almost ruined my life!* 10/10 &lt;3         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  APB Reloaded Live Action Trailer HD&nbsp;
6072	0	a	Can't even start the game
929	1	a	best shooter game ever good quality and great graphics i really recommend getting this game
10736	1	a	The game is great fun and an amazing game to play with friends. Tons of room for progression and customization isn't half bad either (Through the use of dyes/skins).  One downside is the presence of micro-transactions. While they are there, they are not obtrusive and pay to win is kept mostly to a minimum, almost every item you can buy with gold can be gotten in-game for free. Some exceptions include backpacks, xp potions, pet food, and loot tier potions.

10167	0	a	Don't get this game. I got this thinking it would be like the online version of fallout. I was ever so wrong. The interface is confusing, enemy spawning is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and it altogether is a giant pile of mutant dung.

6516	0	a	Heyyo, DON'T GET THIS GAME. They ruined it. Bunny-hopping-galore even with sniper rifles it works perfectly. NTEC is useless compared to Joker and it's brutal how much Gamersfirst ruined this game compared to how they first started off in APB R beta when they balanced LTL weapons... now every gun is â¥â¥â¥â¥ed. RIP APB.. maybe you should've just stayed dead. :(
10672	1	a	It's k.
4010	0	a	 If you enjoy grinding consistently for months/years and forking out Hundreds to Thousands of dollars a year for a premium membership and/or Pay2Win weapons, then this game was made specifically for YOU.
8571	0	a	Never play this game... I've played it nearly since 2011 but the game is always sucks. So many hackers and owners of the game just cares about your wallet. Bad.
9537	0	a	It's kinda... 'Eh'
8051	0	a	You have to pay for things and you do anything
4349	0	a	If you play this game without pay RIP or rather Rest In Grinding. Unless you pay for this game, you will find yourself grinding hour after hour. The customization is horrible if you are not a premium player. You should probably not play this game if your going to not play as a premium player. It was fun while it lasted. RIP APB and RIG all non prem players.
9173	1	a	yup. i recommend it
10050	1	a	I &lt;3 you G1. And this game is rather monotonous. Still nice though. Instead of sleeping pills or such. Works.
3441	1	a	I got this game before i had steam so i have about 1000+ hours. This game is somewhat pay to win but then again you can reach almost everything without paying. The physics engine might not be the greatest but boy you can have a lot of fun with it. 10/10 would stunt again.
7288	0	a	Not cool. I have like, a super video card and i waste like 2 hours downloading it to get 'Unable to load dude to video card' FIX PLEASE
4140	0	a	I thought this game was very bad as the setup was very slow and i had isues installing it due to it containing a virus and hacking my firewall.

1843	1	a	Nice shot!
3673	1	a	I love this game. But there is lots of hackers playing it. So that is the bad side of the story ;) If you are playing as a cop you are cool, because it's not that easy. But if you are the robber then it's just too easy and it's just boring. Believe me. It's a good game. :D (PEACE)
3724	1	a	I really like the game. It might look like its hard to get into but with the help of some friends you can get better really quickly.

5098	0	a	This game is free to PAY  the microtransactions are VERY expensive, and worth less because the things you buy AREN'T PERMANENT, they stuff you buy with REAL MONEY are there for like a week. then you have to pay more. and if you are smart and don't pay money this game is slow and impossible to enjoy this game DONT'T PUT MONEY OR YOUR TIME IN THIS CASH GRAB

8470	0	a	Hackers everywhere, just don't spend a single dime on this game.
106	1	a	Ok i have been playing this game for a few years, ill keep it simple, Game is full of (Rage) This game is based on color matchmaking which kinda ruined it, green,bronze,silver and gold. Golds going against silver and below is pretty unfair and can be furstraightin, matchmaking needs to be improved,new players never have an idea of what to do because tutorial needs to be improved as well. Game also needs more content like (Maps) (Missions) and (Cars) not weapons and contacts. people buying guns for $60 and getting #rekt by a free gun lel? Moral of the story the game has potential but no one is putting in enough effort.
5279	0	a	Dont bother downloading it or playing what use to be a decent game has now turned to â¥â¥â¥â¥ and go figuer its G1 (Gamers first) fault. a year 1/2 ago it was 1 out of 100 were hacking (cheating) now its like 1 out of 5 are cheating and the rest of the 4 that arnt eather become cheaters or quit, i quit again. if you want to waste your time cash just buy a hack like everyone else they seem to not care anymore.
3944	0	a	once you run out of missions it is really bad
6018	0	a	AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO CANT GET THIS GAME TO LOAD? &gt;:[
4042	0	a	i am still having log in issues with this trash game 
2281	1	a	Its ok.
569	1	a	The game is absolutely incredible. I've read a lot of negative reviews, but I believe most of them aren't justified. People call the game 'unfair' to new players. But seriously, the game is no different than any MMORPG out there, you can't start a character on level 1 and expect to kill level 100 players. The difference is a lot smaller though, I've made 17 kills in a mission versus top-level opponents as soon as I started playing the game, with only starter weapons. Other complains are that it's 'pay to win', which is also untrue. Basically premium only helps you speed up the process and get money faster to buy weapons, also unlocks more customization options. However the premium doesn't even affect the gameplay, it's mostly like an EXP boost which are being sold in most MMO's. Other complains are that the game is dying. Actually the community is slowly starting to grow back. It gained 16% more players just this month, so the game isn't really dying at all. Some districts are so crowded that it gets even annoying. Another complain is that the community sucks and people are teamkilling eachother. Basically it's no different than CS:GO. When you kill more than 5 teammates you get kicked from the game, so I don't see a problem here.  The only thing that I agree with the negative reviews are that the game lags. A lot. I cover up the recommended requirements all the way, yet the game still lags on low graphic time to time. I still don't know what's the problem, but even with lag I can't help it, but enjoy the game. It's just awesome. Tons of customizations, tons of fun, cars, weapons .. everything. I hope the devs do something about the lag issue, then I will count it as the best f2p game ever.
6763	0	a	lag, terrifying community, idiots on your team, gold and silver players join bronze districts, and the matchmaking is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t, â¥â¥â¥â¥ing kids talk â¥â¥â¥â¥, and #2muchpay2win #animeâ¥â¥â¥â¥everywhere #sickdriving --&gt; means driving is â¥â¥â¥â¥. cars are rediculous, too much armas noobs. at first this game was one of my favorite, me myself played this game for more than +650hrs, i have never experienced such horor in these last few years. as a sum up, dont even.
4639	0	a	Probably the worst MMO I've played. Actually, probably the worst game I've ever played, and I've played quite a few â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ in my day. Let me explain.  First off, the only feature I loved about the game was character creation. So many options and the ability to adjust things to your liking without having to use presets, which I assumed a game like this would. (Judging by the graphics and how similar the characters look.) I spent around 25+/- minutes creating my character alone.   Now once I finished and chose my spawn location, I was pretty excited about getting into the game. Once I loaded, the first thing I noticed right off the bat was the graphics were less pleasing to the eye than they were during character creation. Checked my graphics settings and they were the same as they were before, so I'm not sure what that was all about. Changing them to a lower one and then back didn't solve the problem either.   You're immediately given tutorial quests which basically give you the run down on controls and game basics, but I was shot and killed before I could even finish the second list. Apparently you have the option of being or not being ready, and your decision effects whether or not another player (real person, not npc) can come and shoot you, bash into your car, or any other way to â¥â¥â¥â¥ you and your â¥â¥â¥â¥ up. I'm not sure when I became ready, was probably just an accidental setting I did while being a derp with the keyboard commands, but I wish that would have been earlier in the tutorial lists so that I would know 'Hey don't go outside while you're ready or some random will see your noob â¥â¥â¥ and kill you on sight.'   I was then asked to hijack a car and drive 500m. First, I had to hit the F key 3 times before my character would even consider the possibility of taking a car, and it took me a few times to finally hijack one because by the time I hit the F key enough times, the vehicle was driving off and my character was just standing there in the middle of the road being the prissy little â¥â¥â¥â¥ she's been since the start. Once I finally got a car, I tried to drive it per the 500m quest goal, and I have got to tell you. It's like learning how to drive all over again. You go left, the game decides to go left 3 seconds later. Oh, you want to straighten out your car so you're not ramming into pedestrians on the street? Okay, just hit the arrow key once to go the other direction and we'll just ram you into on-coming traffic because what is smooth movement, am I right? I was zig-zaging down the road until the quest was finished, then immediately got out of the car and ran far away from it never to drive again.  Trying not to give up on the game just yet, I started running around to see if I could find other players who hopefully wouldn't try to gun me down at first glance, but was set in 'not ready' just in case. Mind you, I was pretty much naked because somehow from the start to the car ride, I lost my clothes and I never tried to figure out how to get them back. /secretly calls out YOLO/ After running for about 5 minutes, I finally found another player at a vehicle spawn machine thingy and tried to communicate with him using the chat. After waiting a minute for a response, he turns around, sees me, tries to shoot, realizes I can't be killed, then hops into his mini-van and drives off towards the sunset unscaved--while all I was trying to do was make a friend who knew how to play the game.  All in all, this game gets a whole whopping 0.1/5 from me. While I know there are fans who love it, which is perfectly fine, I can't find myself playing this any more, which is what I usually force myself to do when I'm really trying to find the good parts of a game, but first impressions go along way with me and this game makes Nexon's look golden.   I'd rather play GTA Online with all the f-ckery that goes on there than deal with this game. At least it's optimized better, has better graphics and playstyle, and doesn't make you feel like you're playing GTA 3's crackhead cousin of a game.  Last but not least, this game is practically p2w, with premium members getting a 30%~ bonus of cash and experience from missions and people who are willing to pay for weapons and such get all the good stuff from their cash shop. The store page should say 'Free to download, but must pay to get anywhere in the game without wanting to rip your hair out with the normal sluggish process,' not free to play.
8330	0	a	What a waste of space on my disk. Where should I start? Graphics are terrible. Even for a f2p game they are bad, and I know how to make graphics for games so they just completly failed there. Most important issue is the game play on it's own. 3rd Person camera isn't the best, driving cars is just a joke - Even ps2 games had better driving controls than this. Maybe add some kind of objectives or mission that new players would understand? If they want to fix a game a new game engine would be a good start. If this game will get to a level of sainrows 3 or gta IV I will play but since I doubt it will ever happen you are getting negative review. Beside paying Â£22 for a dlc for this game is like a sin. From the money you made you should be able to make a good game, not a â¥â¥â¥â¥ like that. I will not go even to mentioning that the game crashes on first lanch and that I have to go to the task manager to fix it. 2/10
8390	0	a	Made a break from this game few moths ago .. I was max level.. Didn't start again P2W and full of cheaters .. Try h1z1 .. Oh I remember how whenever we start a match we would see a guy on enemy team with oca nano .. P2W gun .. We just give up at that point :D
8336	0	a	I played this game quite a bit a ways back, I think about 6 months ago. And then I stopped.. I don't remember what frustrated me so much that I stopped, so I decided to give it another go. 1. EXTREMELY long load times. 2. disconnection problems (VERY BAD). we're talking every 2 or 3 minutes getting disconnected and dealing with 4 minutes worth of loading to get fully connected again, just to be disconnected 2 or 3 minutes later once again. 10 disconnects in 1 hour, total play time 11 minutes maybe in 1 hour, 20 minutes in 2 hours?? SOOOOO BUGGY!!! I tried using steam to verify installation, and then I also did the repair option on the APB launcher.. 5 times. Have not found it to fix the problem of constantly disconnecting from the game every 2 or 3 minutes. Makes the game completely un-playable for me. What a complete waste of 2 hours for me trying to get any play time on this. Seriously BUGGED. They have had PLENTY of time to fix the problems with this game, but it's performance indicates that they have no intention to. Back months &amp; months ago it was LESS buggy than it is now. I actually have 240 hours logged on this game from back then. It was still buggy then, but less so. However, they must have screwed something else up since then. Others may not have the same problems as me, but is unplayable for me due to constant disconnects.... something I am not experiencing with other game titles.
7837	0	a	This would have been awesome at launch with tonnes of peeps in constant battle. Small crowd playing now, most of whom are too deadly to really get a start in

3780	0	a	Pros:  -Best character customization in any game -Many cars -100 people districts -Fight clubs for constant action  Cons:  -â¥â¥â¥â¥ load of hackers/Triggerbotters -Heavily pay-to-get worthy things but not necessarily pay to win because most ARMAS guns are reskins -Bad graphics -Bad optimization -Matchmaking is garbage -Big health pools that favor central europeans mostly when it comes to ping so they kill you fast even if you hit them first and with more bullets -Small development team and a very greedy one. They do not even have an animator even though they made millions through ARMAS -Not new content since 2011 -Not solo-friendly -Not really a way to make big profits other than being a talented designer. -Silvers must play with golds because of the ridiculously low population -Combat is â¥â¥â¥â¥, hit the head or the legs, same thing. -Not really any new content announced for the future 
4687	0	a	Fun for a while, but very pay to win and ruined by hackers. Punk buster was a hassle to even get working but now that that's gone it might be worth playing again.
984	1	a	I Recommend this game to others because it is a fun faction game where you get to have more freedom to how you customize your cars and character than you do in GTA, and as in the name of the game, All Points Bulletin, ranking is eveything and allows you to unlock new cars, clothes, emotes, and weapons.
2487	1	a	The game is realy cool but not everybody have the graphic you need a strong computer but it s realy cool
8022	0	a	so last year i wrote a review on this game where i rougly said: gameplay is junk, the people who play it are jerks... it's pay 2 win... it's sloppy, the controls responds slowly and the graphics load slower then a snail could win a god damn marathon.  BUT THE CUSTOMIZATION IS GOOD!  thats everything positive... the clothing and tattoos... if they had this kind of custom items in a game like grand theft auto it would be the BIGGEST GAME EVER... but it dosen't, it's the worst damn â¥â¥â¥â¥ i've tried...  do NOT try it! if you have ever tried playing a first person shooter and someone kills you repeadetly thats only the tip of the iceberg, here you will be kicked off servers by punkbuster because someone SAID you were hacking  i was stupid enough to recommend this only for customisation but i regret this now...  NO! do NOT play this...  I CAN'T WARN YOU ENOUGH! DON'T.... DO IT!!!!

4651	0	a	I'm not quite sure if some players are using hacks or they're just too pro as in too pro to know where we guys would come. lol
2468	1	a	this is nice game
9418	1	a	Loads of content for a free-to-play MMO. Some of the game play can be a bit grinding, but the crafting is rich with variety.
4474	0	a	Pay 2 win, everwhere.
10327	1	a	Not bad, just not great.  Fallout 3 with no VATS.  Cool for a free game.
9301	1	a	Thumnbs up for this game,It is very diffrent from the other games I have played before but is loads of fun!!!!
307	1	a	Beautiful game, it starts slow as getting used to it is quite dificult, much more with all the other experienced players. Essetialy, it's a GTA like game, online-only, with much more to do in terms of missions sadly not in terms of interactivity. Still I recommend you all play this, puT some time into it and you'll start winning, guides also help, you should also take in mind lag is part of the game, driving is also horrible and some weapons are completely useless whilst others amazing so make sure to spend your money wisely, my top picks for starter weapons, if you really wanna get kills, would be the colby-smg (for close to mid quarters) and the H-NVR 7 (a 2 hit kill sniper), if you know how to tap fire but an N-tec, they're really good once you know how to use it! Remember the tutorials always help!
8155	0	a	Imbalanced Pay2Win game with a lot of potential, only pay when you have the cash to invest! If you really do it can be loads of fun, watch out for griefers though.
7564	0	a	First of all, no, I have not played this game for 10 hrs...barely 15 min is enough suffering.  The reason that the couter is on 10 hrs probably due the uncloseable trashy game egnine, I have to restart Steam 3 times and not less than 10 times from the library to actually launch the game. And when you try to exit, the crappy game engine will not close and decide to stay in your computer to steal your computer resource.  Okay, maybe it is just my computer. Let get into the game. Principle of the game is good, bad guys vs cops in an open city and bad behaviour leads to wanted level and popo would then hunt you down.  However the gameplay experience is just bad as licking turd on the buttom of your shoes. If you try to drive any vehicle, the steering has a horrible delay like your are controlling Mars rover on Earth. Go check in the forum and you will see how comman this problem is. Customize your character ? cool! Even better if it does not take you 30 seconds to load a new hair style on the each selection. It is a free game, so I would not complain about the pay-to-win mechanism here. In fact I manage to kill an enemy with only half the magazine of my first rifle, not too bad. Oh yea, not too bad if you can withstand the dial-up-alike ping. For the record I played a lot online games and I am pretty sure my connection is decent on normal games. I lived in UK and the EU server gives me 140ms ping and very constant lag spikes, I guess the game server is just too busy to serve me then.  2 / 10. Rubbish game, but its free, also lag like a very unfinished development game.  Good for you spending your time reading this, now u can save your computer space, also your treasure time instead of investing into the game. You are welcome.
4013	0	a	This game is what would happen to GTA if Rockstar was feeled with ****ing vegatables
7489	0	a	I know the game is free. I know this. Does it mean I have to forgive it for being crap? No.  This game is exactly what I would expect from what is essentially a free-to-play Grand Theft Auto. Everything feels about ten years old, there is lag and general bugginess, and not a sh*t was given by anyone else as to whether the objectives were being carried out.  I didn't play a ton, but sometimes when you experience something, you are able to read it for the best that it could be independent of the momentary experience. This game doesn't have the capacity to entertain for the long term. Free-to-play games rarely do, though I feel I do have to mention Counter-Strike as one of a few exceptions to that rule. To be fair, though, this game is much newer than CS, and yet learns nothing from it or games like it.  This game seems more or less like a controlled environment from which get trolled other people than a legitimate attempt at entertaining; I knew that the first time that I attempted to kill the person with the briefcase, only to be shot from a vantage point directly above me that I had no hope of approaching from any other direction.  Take it for what you will - I played the game as long as I could stand to.

13	1	a	Awesome game! Definitely worth your time!  I am a leader of a clan and i have 5 years of experience in this game. I make this review to proof to you that this game is worth your time.  1) I never payed for this game, i'm gold for 3-4 years in a row now (In the first year i had a very bad pc and internet connection which was the reason me being bad mostly). I use free to play guns, mostly N-Hvr (Given or Bought with game money) and i'm winning against 85-90% of the players who are using guns they bought in shops for real money. Its true that i had some struggling moments at the beginning, but it was all worth it. Don't forget that i started 5 years ago... They made it more simple for starters now. I also want to inform you that there are many opportunities to earn real money (G1C) to buy stuff (guns, kits, ...) in the armas market for doing events which are explained to you in the forums of this game.  2) The community in this game is awesome, i can't give it another word. In every game there will be som D**ks but that is inevitable, generally speaking, 8 to 10 of the people you will meet are very friendly.  Other good points i experienced in this game; -Updating the game on regular basis -Good graphics. -Detailed character/car design capabilities -Can make nice music themes / songs -VERY good player support  Some lesser points i experienced; -Some people out of your mission are preventing you from proceeding, keeping you from critical time (Happens rarely). -I myself do not have this problem, but some of my friends can't play the game cause of FPS lagg. -If your friend is silver and you are gold, it is highly possible you get 2 golden opponents matched against you (This is the only major problem in this game at this moment in my opinion). It is even possible that 3 golds are matched against 4 silvers. The 3 golds win easily cause they have more experience / team play. This is also the reason for the negative comments about people saying this game is p2w, which it isn't. The game itself is perfectly playable with f2p guns like i do. Its just the matching system which needs some more attention.  Hope this helped you :)  P4wn - Enforcer- 'Sharp' Leader - Patriot EU2

6294	0	a	Played it.. sucks. Too many things happening, crappy controls, ugly graphics.. not worth 'Free to Play'

7368	0	a	Honestly, APB: Reloaded itself is great and fun. The game type is entirely unique, in that it's basically criminal gangsters versus lawful gangsters (Criminals vs Enforcers), destroying the city through random missions and the robbery of citizens' belongings by means of ram-raiding shop windows or mugging them on the street. The open world instances are flashy and fun to look at and explore, even if the majority of buildings can't be entered. The game's customization is, and maybe always will be, the best of its class -- if there even is another in that glorious top-tier -- simply because you can make your own theme songs, decals, and more through the in-game editors. Even if you aren't very good at art, you can still enjoy the simplicity of the game's customization, and make complex designs very easily.  The reason I don't recommend this game is because of the company that presently owns it: GamersFirst. Whatever good content they can add is made worthless by one of two means: The slow ranking system, or the simple fact that it's exclusive to the cash shop, making it one of the largest pay-to-wins I've ever played. There's also the major problem of cheaters/hackers, and the terrible security that's presently implemented. Still, I found a way to look past all of that and enjoy the game for about a year, even if the servers rubber-banded every now and then. Unfortunately, that rubber-banding has gotten worse over time, as the servers are simply getting more and more degraded by the second. GamersFirst is incapable of understanding that they need to upgrade these servers, and now the game is in a state where every movement has a 5-second delay, rubber-banding runs rampant, and disconnections occur every 5-10 minutes which won't allow you back on for another 20. GamersFirst does not understand the real ideas behind running a good game besides content, and in that they have ruined the experience of the game completely.  This is not the first good concept they've destroyed. WarRock is another shooter that now belongs to Nexon Europe, and once belonged to GamersFirst. The vehicles in the game are solid, and plays like a free-to-play Battlefield, in its own way. When my friends first told me about WarRock, the first thing they warned me to avoid was the public servers. I asked why and they gave me one answer: hackers. By the time I got that warning, though, I had already joined a public server and saw a flying tank getting destroyed by a glitched helicopter. I quickly left, and played in a private room with my friends, having a great time until the servers suddenly went down. They didn't come back up within half an hour, and we all decided to uninstall the game shortly after.   It saddens me that APB has been ruined by such a terrible company, to the point where I can no longer recommend it. I've heard rumors that Perfect World Entertainment is looking into buying APB: Reloaded from GamersFirst, and I must say that sounds like a far better idea than letting it run on the slowly melting servers it's running on now.
4461	0	a	This game worked once for me. ONCE. it was super laggy, i didnt know how to play the game and i got spawnkilled by a guy with a rocket launcher.    So whatever you do, dont waste your time on this stupid game. it could have been a good game but its just â¥â¥â¥â¥. evreything is â¥â¥â¥â¥.
7032	0	a	this is a good game  but have â¥â¥â¥â¥ing bad engine
8978	0	a	Typical Free2Play game
7876	0	a	I did not recommend this game it's Pay to win
9637	0	a	This game seems like it would be cool, but i cant get past the first part because the game crashes after i kill the first guy. When i go to options to turn graphics down, it immediantly glitches and closes the option menu out. Take my first experience with the game in consideration when you try to get it. Otherwise, it looks like it would be cool.....if it didnt crash every five seconds.
2925	1	a	I love this game ! You must to try it &lt;3
3071	1	a	idk if is good game have not play it but it look fun it almost look like gta5 in a way
5893	0	a	damn this game looks cool IF I COULD PLAY IT whenever i try to start up the game it screws up its bs
4620	0	a	Was a really bad game, I didn't like it, do not even try it.
577	1	a	Fun game to play lone wolf or with a few friends. Long wolf you'll be play with others regardless. With friends communications will help you a lot, which is a given. Unlimited ways to customise your character, clothes, cars, symbols and themes. 9/10 imo
2886	1	a	Really good game overall.
6571	0	a	Cant even figure out how to beat the tutorial  -10/10
3025	1	a	Game is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥T alot of the time but its unique in its own way. Lots of costumizations. i still love playing the game. i rage here and there but its nothing i still have fun
4401	0	a	The game is now based purely on micro transactions. At the end of the day, If you pay you win.
4056	0	a	Want to waste your time trying to do missions, only to be rolled by smurfs on -every- district of -every- server? Buy this now! There is no stopgap to allow you to level up or compete with the higher end players. they just destroy you.
7954	0	a	Volvo pls buy this game and make it more awesome because 'gamerfirst' just suck â¥â¥â¥. Every week they release a new weapon but upgrading the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing servers ? no.... why should they its not like the servers suck balls. They don't even care about the game those greedy â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s.
9848	0	a	OK, I am not saying anything about the game (in fact never played the game), but i am saying somthing about the account system. The account system is the worst thing since the Pet Rock (thats an actual thing). The reason it's bad is because I can't login. Every acount I make from Gamerfirst I can't play with. So I make the account, then put my email, THEN my computer crashes. But it saves my email and nothing else. So when i try and make a new account, since it saves my email I can't make a new account. I can't login because the account doesn't exist. This happened every time with every game. Again not played the game, Just wasted an hour of my life on an account that is not real...
8114	0	a	Credit card = MVP EVRRY TIME!!!!
5176	0	a	Its been a year since ive played this game. I installed the game wondering why I stopped in the first place. I instantly realized why I stopped playing it.   -Constantly micro-freezing on a computer better than the one I originally played it on in the past with no issues.  -Toxic community of hateful wads of sh!t.  -P2W system of weapons and skills.  -Hacking around every corner.  -Constantly being reminded by the game to buy things with real money, also opens up the marketplace for the game on start up, really subtle.  -Completely broken matchmaking system where brand new players are set up against seasoned veterans of the game.  -Hit detection is non-existent.  -You 'rent' weapons unless you cough up about $15-$70.  -And overall one of the worst experiences ive had with multiplayer games. ever.   and they somehow managed to make the game even worse over the course of 2 and a half years on top of having already been a steaming pile of crap after leaving the initial membership model of the original company.   We need an APB out on this game's current developers. Be sure to send the San Paro PD, with their OPGLs.
8640	0	a	  Its a fun game. But its pay to win. Which no one likes games like that.
567	1	a	It's ok
10709	1	a	These graphics are â¥â¥â¥â¥ing, next-gen holy â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. If I could wear the Oculus Shift with this I would whip out my â¥â¥â¥â¥ and â¥â¥â¥â¥ing stick it in the computer usb port, y'know it fits, and then I would ejaculate all over my keyboard and then take off the armor of my Paladin and wank harder like holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ man. These graphics are intense. They get me so erect.
6204	0	a	GTA 5 but worse
5063	0	a	This game sucks first of all i hate games where you have to log in its the gayest thing ever and it sucks. lots of problems when i finshed makeing my character it wounldnet let me join a game so this game sucks hate this waste of space do not download not worth it .
1106	1	a	Eh. It's ok I guess.
9268	0	a	The game looks pretty fun to be honest, but i don't think i'll ever play it.   too many problems preventing me from even getting into the game.  -Official site nearly always down, you have to wait a long time on high speed internet for them to send you a verification link after making an account -if you manage to even log in, the faulty launcher gets stuck in an infinite loop, constantly deleting and redownloading the same files.  take a look at the issues the playerbase has with getting access to this game, and save yourself some time.
4921	0	a	I thought I'd give this game a try after hearing about it via word of mouth.   One element that I love, is the character customization and being able to design unique outfits with the designer mode and the player/map interaction. I've only tried playing as a criminal character so far but honestly as a new player I've found it next to impossible to win gunfights and get kills, whether that's due to hackers or not I'm not sure because on numerous occaisions I've scored multiple hits on players and they haven't gone down, yet I get taken down almost every time with only a few shots.   It's not newbie friendly by any means and I'm pretty sure the matchmaking doesn't work at all, everyone I go up against seem to be much more experienced, their clothing designs are a giveaway since you get next to nothing early on. The game itself is also very laggy and vehicle controls are absolutely horrible &amp; unresponsive as vehicle steering also seems to be linked with mouse movement.  To summarize, it's not an enjoyable game for new players and is not one I'd consider spending any real money on since the developers don't seem to be all that engaged with the players, nor fixing obvious flaws with the game &amp; actively dealing with hackers IG.
4105	0	a	This â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game is so bad, the matchmaking system is â¥â¥â¥â¥ and this game is absolutely pay to win. Don't â¥â¥â¥â¥ing spend your time on this stupid game and play somethng else. â¥â¥â¥â¥ing time waster, cars are expensive as â¥â¥â¥â¥ and normal guns can't win agaist armas ones. The graphics are also â¥â¥â¥â¥ing horrible.
9546	1	a	I would have this game's babies
7297	0	a	Used to be fun, it's simply a Money grabbing title now with hackers and 'wtf!?' moments every 5 minutes
8468	0	a	Hello Guys, I've played this game for years starting in 2010 with some friends and I have played around 2000+ hrs on my account and 60 something hours via steam, But the reason I'm writing this review is to give advice to the next Innocent person walking into this â¥â¥â¥â¥ hole of game. Firstly the game is a love hate relationship you either like it or hate it not to mention also customization is brilliant but here comes the negative aspects.  Apb is a free to play mmo cops and robbers themed game, With free to plays you expect microtransactions well there is but the problem is they milk people for money, without considering what people actually want. For example people want the engine update or fix's for annoying bugs, but instead of good updates which make people more happy they slap a armas gun on the market place claiming it to be something magnificent, but it is only a reskin of another weapon in game.   Another reason why this game is bad is because of it's own community, the people in the community are absolutely cancerous and only strive to â¥â¥â¥â¥ you off or make your day worse, Not saying everyone is cancerous because I've have spoke to quite a few nice people it's just the majority. Not to mention there are quite a few unbalanced weapons, like before I used to think 'Well that guy is Just better than me' Which in most cases it was; but if you put a unbalanced weapon in the hands of a good player or even a bad one they can â¥â¥â¥â¥ your entire match up.   After all of that Negative â¥â¥â¥â¥, I'll come down to saying this I'm giving a Warning to all players or people thinking of Playing this game. This game can cause you stress like nothing else and if you have anything like epilepsy or some sort PTSD stay away because it will cause you so much stress and make you soo â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ that you're either going to have a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing seizure or just freak the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out. Last thing I will say just to give you another reason to not play is gamersfirst make tons of promises which never happen.  Out of 1-10 It's a 4/10  Thus that makes the end of my Extremely Negative review and if any of you are interested I'm selling 4 of legendarys on Jericho (NA) add Ryoukomatoii and PM me or leave a message in this â¥â¥â¥â¥ review. Legendaries, Grenade launcher which shoots Concs, Nano, Ntec 7 Ursus and Hitchhiker I believe. I'll take real money these Will be going at a cheap price
3493	1	a	I love this game, years of playing it. 1300+ hours between Steam and In-Game. It's a little buggy and full of raging teenagers, but the shooting and fighting is great. I've spent hours just driving around and ramming things. If you want a F2P Third Person Shooter with a little bit of a learning curve, I'd recommend this one.
4739	0	a	Okay, I don't write reviews at all so don't take this as a grain of salt but a whole flippin' mineral.  It's bad. I downloaded this because of nostalgic memories, playing this at my exes house and actually somewhat enjoying it. This was what? 4-5 years ago. Not sure what human smashed their head off the keyboard to produce the code and ideas I see present now.   As I write this the game is loading, I just checked and it disconnected me. Now, that sounds all fine and dandy if it wasn't the second if not third time this has done this....  Honestly, the only reason I have 5+ hours on this game is because 2 was spent on customizing my character and the rest was loading screens or errors.  Save your time and find a better game.    Love, a disappointed and drunk peep.
1639	1	a	lol this game still gets updated?
5949	0	a	I have just downloaded the game, and i can't even create a character before i get disconnected. I't keeps saying it might be connection error, but that can't be it because i can play all other online games without any problems with connection.
4999	0	a	Its lame,bad,pay 2 win,buggy and the car drives like there were on ice
2726	1	a	it wont let me play the game this is bull â¥â¥â¥â¥
10875	1	a	is rlly good
4476	0	a	One word to describe my experience in this game : Hackers   Another player openly admitted he was running hacks during gameplay and then proceeded to highlight every other player in the server running them for me. I didn't believe them at first but then after seeing what they could do there was no doubt these players are running hacks.  I thought when I saw the huge green banner saying 'Fair Fight' that is what I would get... WRONG!!  It is a Pay 2 Win game loaded with Hackers and Whales. The lag is so bad that I thought my keyboard was messing up but nope-- turns out all driving input is tied in with your latency so if you get a bad ping spike (which hackers exploit to no end) your vehicle becomes 100% uncontrollable.  Avoid this game at all costs. I would say to buy GTA V instead but they have the same issues and others with a worthless customer support team who avoid responding to tickets via any loophole they can think of even when not based on factual information.  Great game concept APB has .. terrible delivery.
6464	0	a	if you wanna play a free 2 play game, then don't play this game it's a pure p2w game. guns from the store are way OP. if you wanna spend money or have enough keyboards to break, play this game :D
9503	1	a	great survival game good crafting recipes this has a good storyline to it its awesome
7415	0	a	Most broken game i have played!  performance is â¥â¥â¥â¥, uses ages to load anything, have to use 48x AA to fully use the gpu, and you're stuck with 75 fps the pvp is complete â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t as mission makes you face people with rpg's that instakill you or snipers while new players are stuck with a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ assault rifles and a pistol with barely any damage.
2783	1	a	I am so addicted to this game. If I could afford to, I would skip work to play this all night tonight and all day tomorrow. Simply amazing!
9663	0	a	An okay mmo with a dead community.
3140	1	a	this game is well made and its fun to play and blow tings up
3373	1	a	To be honest I do really like the game but it is more of a pay to win game since you need to buy weapons with real money to actually own them forever, other than that it's great.
9920	1	a	if fallout and some random mmo made a baby fallen earth would be it this game has a lot of amazing things that have been put together but the thing that i love the most is that you could have your wepon on your right hand left hand or if you have two you can duel wield so thats about it thanks for watching
2510	1	a	Hell yeah, awesome game!
1884	1	a	Really the best F2P game i've ever played!
9330	1	a	its â¥â¥â¥â¥ing trash 0/10
254	1	a	It is good
1640	1	a	it sucks, constantly drains me, and screaming, and im not talking about my girlfriend
5368	0	a	This, my friend, is the worst game in the planet. I installed this â¥â¥â¥â¥, got fps drops af with a gtx 1070 and i5 6600, after that killed a team mate, because i was noob af. Then got some weird internet problem (im pretty sure it wasn't a kick, at least it wasn't saying anything like 'You got kicked blablabla')  Meanwhile i was talking with ma bois without any lag.  So i decided to uninstall!  Hope you had a good time reading this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t, but serious just buy GTA!
8294	0	a	This game is an awesome idea,but there is just too many mistakes made in it.  First of all its complicated,atleast it was for me. No real tutorial rather than text. Pro players in starter area. Glitches. Pay to win.
10236	1	a	Like a less fun version of fallout but its free!
4211	0	a	If you play this game without pay RIP or rather Rest In Grinding. Unless you pay for this game, you will find yourself grinding hour after hour. The customization is horrible if you are not a premium player. You should probably not play this game if your going to not play as a premium player. It was fun while it lasted. RIP APB and RIG all non prem players.
2408	1	a	This game is oodles of fun. But don't let that mask the greediness of the people of Gamers First. Yes this game does intail all that it says. But you have to 'pay' for more then half of them. Customization, Permement and Exclusive Guns, Cash and Progression (Exp) bonuses, Car Parts, Symbol creation, and I'm sure there is lots more you will find.   Premium (Which entails Bonus Cash and EXP, Symbol/Car Customisation and... I think that's it.) costs 799 G1 credits which ammounts to 10$ US total. But that I beleive is the beta price. Because the image has a 1199 (15$ US) crossed out in the back which makes the current price a special and assuming it doesn't last until it's fully released.  Permament/Premium guns. Guns can range in price from 17$ all the way up to 60$. 60 Dollars! I cannot fathom who decided to begin the price range like that, but for G1 to agree on it takes the cake. These guns are character bound. So if you want a gun on your Criminal and Enforcer then your lookin at 120
6958	0	a	As of now i cant even spawn i try over and over and i can't spawn and until they fix this i would not recomend unless you would like to sit through 5 minutes of loading screens for the game to crash.

8174	0	a	Want to try an MMO that's Free to Play!? This game has some of the best customization out of any game I've ever played. You can customize your character's clothing, appearance, tattoos, and even your car. It's FREE, check it out today!!!  UPDATE (1/1/2016): If I were you, I wouldn't waste your time on APB: Reloaded since it has become a Pay to Win style game. The company that took this game over has changed it from the glory this game once was.   You'd be better off NOT wasting your time with this title.
1447	1	a	its good game i like this game

8376	0	a	I've put a few weeks into this game.  The missions are good and varied. The customization is pretty decent as well. Though, a LOT of customization options are behind a pay wall in the ARMAS marketplace, which is overpriced as â¥â¥â¥â¥. The combat comes down to gear. The Meta is spam and pray. SMGs, Assault Rifles, RPGs, and grenades. Being outgeared is a common issue. If one person has a better gun than the rest of your team your team is â¥â¥â¥â¥ed. Hit detection isn't pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥, getting hit behind walls and cars is common.  I wouldn't recommend this game for anything but the customization. That's the best part of this game, and it's a grind to get anything worth customizing.

1298	1	a	basically the free version of gta 5 and sort of gta 4 with no campaign mode and only multiplayer. The fact that it's free is amazing!, and you get the choice to be a police or a bad guy, unlike gta Overall. I really liked this game and the fact that its free is baws, so i rate it 9.5/10
1322	1	a	hours of fun customizing cars and outfits aswell as lots of fun killing and driving through the streets running over pedrestrians

6969	0	a	I do not reccomend anyone to waste his time by playing this game. It's poorly made and very inbalanced. The match-making system is terribly broken. You'll often find yourself, a low lvl 5 guy against lvl 200 players. It's very frustrating, progress is very slow and unrewarding. The game is very poorly made and optimized, the physics engine is terrible, steering lags a whole 3-4 seconds making car driving close to imposible. The game is full of trolls and rammers and the overall atmosphere of this game is of hate. The most commonly typed sentence in this game is 'â¥â¥â¥â¥ y0u N00B di3 â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥!' Many players were banned for no reason because of an upsurge of cheaters and with every patch the game just keeps getting worse, the only additions being new stuff to rob money from you with. I DO NOT Reccomend this garbage to anyone.

5488	0	a	If you like getting camped by rocket launchers straight out of spawn. This is the game for you.
7026	0	a	This game USED to be truly great. But due to severe mismanagement of the original developer company. They went bankrupt which meant the Game got taken down. About a Year or so later Gamers First aquired the game.  Everyone was excited and happy the game was comming back. What followed as the DEV Blogs started comming out was a step by step description of how Gamers First was taking an axe to the original game.  They ruined several of the key aspects of the game. Most notable the Editors. But gameplay suffered greeatly aswell. My freinds and I had spent several hundreds of hours in the original. And every now and then we will give the gamers first version a go. But the game is now just a shadow of what it once was.  Dont waste your time with this...Thats the best advise I can give you.
2232	1	a	Always come back to this game, it's just different to everything else that it's compelling honestly. It's not very rewarding or welcoming for newer players, and basically has a skill 'cliff' once you start playing with better people. It's an amazing game once you get into it. Please don't â¥â¥â¥â¥ing listen to the 'p2w' â¥â¥â¥â¥ that some people still believe, the N-Tec, Joker Carbine, PMG, and HVR are the best guns, which can all be bought very quickly as you hop into the game for the first time. A lot of the guns you don't know are usually just reskins of the HVR or N-Tec you get through loyalty rewards, purchased on the store, or from endgame contacts. Some missions are flawed, like VIP missions and a few unfair locations for them. All guns are usable at certain distances, and you change a lot. It's nice. Trust me son.
2211	1	a	This game is great fun and you easily get hooked to it. Both maps are amazing and teamwork strives in this game. The customization is epic and will get you editing you characted/cars for hours. The major problem to this game is that it is a pay to win, if you are going to spend some money, think twice.
850	1	a	Its a fun game to play with your friends or just solo.  But if you wanna get good...  be ready to get your mom's credit card.  
6161	0	a	only P2W, unfair enemies and cheaters !!! this is what I think about this game 0/10 or -10/10 :(
5240	0	a	This is honestly my first serious review... I wrote a review awhile back, but I felt the need to write a serious one cause this game's gotten even worse than before. At the time of the review, I had 111.7 hrs. And I know it's still counting and all, but this game is actually a real piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ game.   Let's get down and dirty. Pros:  Gameplay is decent  Lots of customization (I spent around 60 hours just trying to customize my crap so I looked sugoi as f*ck),  Absolutely and ridiculously fun with friends. (Honestly, and thing is fun with friends... I have no friends. this is a lie.)  Cons: â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ community â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Company â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ optimization â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ hackers â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ b*llshit â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ servers â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Anti-cheat (One review said False ban for hack? Like ffs) â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Service (Automated replies. No help at all.)  I'm for sure gonna keep playing this game, cause I freaking love the customizations in it, but I really recommend you stay as far away from this game as possible. You gotta work for the money, and working for the money is complete hell because of all those cons up there.  TL:DR This game should literally kill itself.
591	1	a	An Awesome Game!! XD This game is just like GTA 5 basically, but just less features thats all. No lag in all servers that i have played. Really fun game when u play with friends

1893	1	a	Has more crying kids then Call of Duty eventhough is has less players 10/10
2145	1	a	Good Game but as soon as you reach Gold there is many people with Hacks - Triggerbots etc. Kind of sad, very low hack protection and a lot of very low Rank people without anything but are gold, mhmm suspicious.. Apparently it should get better soon
1645	1	a	Very cool game :)
3704	1	a	Alot of pay2win elements, and there is no chance for you to win against players who've spent over 300$ on this game, cuz they got more 'power' cuz of bought modifications and stronger weapons.  Balance is not always good, ''mostly''   I've played this game around 100-200 hours and i do recommend it if you are in state to give money to it and kick some asses as a pay2win player.
8603	0	a	I played a total of 14 hrs. I would not recommend this game for some reason.  1: you can't permanently keep a gun after buying it with real world money and would only last 10 days  2: gameplay is bad  3:erverybody even your own team can be â¥â¥â¥â¥ most of the time. 
3976	0	a	The concept of this game is really cool. Its kinda like a GTA online shooter, its completly open world and the customization possibilities are HUGE! You can literally create everything for your character!   A big downside of this game is the ingame shop. Im playing at gold rank without any premium stuff and weapons and 90% of my opponents are just people with premium to get more money and Golden Weapons with max Upgrades from the store. Not having these can make the game very frustrating since your opponents will just be stronger in any way without much skill. They reg Health faster, their weapons deal more dmg, their accuracy is higher. For example there is a premium SHOTGUN, that hits you for almost full dmg without being in melee combat, which is highly frustrating to play against. This is just an example.   The principle of the game is still fun, but the P2W model ruins it a lot in my opinion.
9467	1	a	This game took me a little bit to get used to, I am very glad I took the extra time and didnt just stop because now I really enjoy this game. I have put in a decent amount of hours into the game, and I have really become addicted to it. Great crafting set up, decent amount of story type missions for you to do, and actually a pretty friendly community. There are a few things that could really be worked on that I will mention but for the most part a great game.  I very much like the crafting, and sometimes find myself staying in the same shop crafting for hours. You could pretty much completely stay away from anything mission or town wise and be completely happy making yourself food to keep healed up, or use your wide range of healing abilities. You cant completely do that though, there are a few different items that you can not craft, that you would have to get lucky on a drop with or buy from a merchant. From what I have seen you dont get chips(credits) from loot drops though, it seems to come from missions or selling your drops.  The two things that I have noticed that needs improvement are the enemy AI, you can almost walk five feet away from them and have them not notice you at all. The other thing is some of the vagueness on missions. There is not a lot of detial with some of the missions, some of them you really do need to just figure out on your own or ask the help channel for any input.  All and all, I do very much like this game and see myself playing for awhile.  
1236	1	a	Okey heres the deal, this game is a hackers sandbox....with potential. All the old players understand that this game is good, it can be played for free even if its not ideal, and the customisation is what realy sets this game apart, but them hackers tho  Honestly when this game has cleared that problem up then this game will be great again, for any old player has played those matches without hacks were genuine skill were what counted and enjoyed them
4091	0	a	I originally played this game over two years ago on the Gamerfirst game client. I have to say that the game is full of potential and could be way better. Especially if there was more lore on the characters. Besides just being there some of the NPCs that you get missions from seem like a shell with no personlity. Like Double B or Seung Bloodrose.  The customization is very amazing and thats one of the key features that sells the game and that got me too play. Though I did hear about the game on a sims forum  After a while the missions get too repetitive.   ____________  tl:dr, I don't recommend playing the game unless you play it with friends otherwise you'll be amazed by the customization and then be bored to death because of the repetiveness. :D
3839	0	a	This game had so much potential. But the develepors ruined it with these things -Pay to win You could literally just buy your way through the game, I mean, every time you entered the shop you would see things you could only buy for cash -Lack of tutorial There was really no way to know what you were doing in this game. They just drop you in the world and expect you know what to do -Lack of Diversity This game felt the same. The guns felt the same, The cars felt the same, The missions felt the same, and it all just blended into a big gray lump of boring

If you are looking for a tactical team based competative shooter with realism and skill continue your search or I recommend CS:GO.

The review may seem harsh but it isn't a bad game just know what you want from your games and play it!
1217	1	a	This game is awesome and the customization is awesome but prices in armas is real expensive its like 50 euro for 1 car and its super laggy you gut to have a real buff computer and awesome internet connection to handle this game without lags. i recomend this game if you are planing to play much because when you are beginner you dont get really much of the game and you will only met pros in misssions. 9/10
4773	0	a	I do not recommend this game because it's own and run by Gamers First. Whose real name is actually 'Gamers Last' or 'Gamers? Never!' this company doesn't give a damn about players. Their support is â¥â¥â¥â¥, their 'anti hackware' is not only completely buggy and full of vulnerabilities but they also get countless false hits. They use a program called 'Punkbuster', that 'Scans' your system for anything that 'looks' like a hack tool, often getting false hits (Like Torrent Software, Developer tools, worm scanners, hex editors, anti-virus software, a variety of programs and even other games) and sending it to Punkbuster developers called Evenbalance and the company who owns and moderates the game. And although other games use it, those companies have a filter to tell what is a hack and what isn't.   Gamers First doesn't do this, they will ban you for ANY reason, even if it's unjustified and unreasonable, even if you weren't hacking you will still get perma-banned. No second chances, no investigations, no support, no interactions, no nothing. They will refuse to accept any and all tickets, they won't communicate with you, they won't listen no matter how much sense you make and even if you have proof and evidence that you weren't hacking. They don't give a damn about players. Even if that player is a founder in one of their games and has put a lot of money into funding their games. They KNOW their system is broken, they KNOW their software gives them false hits, they KNOW Punkbuster is the worst anti-cheat software ever made, they KNOW they are banning innocent players all over the place, they just don't care.  Play this game and any game run by Gamers First at your own risk. But don't trust this greedy and cruel company with ANY of your money. Don't buy anything from them. Don't put any money into any of their In-game cash or store items or vanity clothing or anything. They will quickly ban you as soon as they have your money and spit in your face like you were nothing but trash. Because to them, all gamers are trash.   Now for the actual review of the game. This game is what you would call a rage game. It is completely saturated with crap and played only by trolls and children. This game will stress you out and make you want to pull your hair out. It is purely PvP and caters to players who are in clans and gangs. Playing this game solo is not advised as you will get picked on, abused and trolled even from the start. The game is practically almost completely pay to win and because this game is like an MMO GTA game, a lot of kids are drawn to it. This is Gamers First cash child, cause so many dumbasses are freely giving away their money into this piece of crap game.  APB Reloaded is actually monitered closely by the faulty Punkbuster software, and they WILL ban you for no reason. The tiniest hit on ANYTHING that the software *THINKS* is a hack will get you automatically perma banned. Even if you don't have any software that can be mistake for a hack, doing something as simpley as clicking too fast or moving your attack button to your mouse wheel so you can fire semi-automatic weapons rapidly just by scrolling your mouse will get you banned. (Sadly, I read that there have been players banned for doing this, simply using the game's own key binding changing option only to get perma-banned.) What's even more ridiculous, is that there are tech savvy players have figured out ways to bypass the punkbuster software and are aimbotting left and right. Don't believe me? Play the game and do a mission, see that guy who keeps killing you with head shots while sprinting at full speed with a pistol? Yeah he is one of them. While there are hackers rampant in the game, players who *ARE NOT HACKING* are getting perma-banned all over the place.   Still don't believe me? Google Gamers Firsts Bans.  you can also go here.  http://forums.gamersfirst.com/topic/301621-november-16-false-positive-bans/   ^That statement is false, as my account was one of those mentioned in that post and I never got my account back. And despite this 'claim' gamers first is still banning people unjustly through these 'false positives'. The false positive they got from me is still unclear, as I never cheated in my life in ANY game. Yet one day i get a noticed I got banned for using a 'macro'? okay, sure, whatever. I don't even know how to use macros.  My honest to God recommendation? Avoid this game and all Gamers First games like the plague, there are a lot of games out there that do what these games do but far better.
3171	1	a	I didn't do a single mission. I just customize my character all day. 11/10
9170	1	a	Detroit, Detroit never changes.  This game is a simulation of the aftermath of the collapse of Detroit. As you roam the streets and search for other sane denizens of downtown Detroit, you will encounter many vile mutant hobos, street gangs, feral dogs and even the fabled Detroit Lawnmower gang, who truly are a formidable foe. As you fight to keep your sanity in the streets of Detroit you will uncover its darkest secrets. Detroit is a dangerous place, children, remember to pack your gasmask because Detroit's atmosphere is toxic due to the large amount of drug and automobile use. The number one way to survive this harsh enviroment is to do the Detroit shuffle, I know that this might seem to be a difficult task at first but once you've done it, you'll never forget. Detroit truly is a dangerous place. Overall this Detroit simulation is good, it sums up the trials and tribulations of downtown Detroit perfectly. The weapons are a perfect representation of what one will find in the dark corners of Detroit. The only con to this game is that there is not enough Detroit, as one can never have enough Detroit. Overall, this game is good. If you are looking for a good Detroit simulator then this is the game for you.  10/10 -Detroit Remember kids; when in trouble, do the Detroit shuffle.  
1101	1	a	The game just stoped working for some reason .. Something about an error but ive done the updates and everthing?....But other than that its a good game

6858	0	a	Gamers Last. â¥â¥â¥â¥ this garbage.
3776	0	a	After putting in a little over 70 hours into this game, I believe I can finally review it.  Pros: -Customization is fantastic in this game, regardless if its clothes or guns, you can change very small details to make your character  feel  your own. -As what on the outside looks like a generic Cops n' Robbers game, it actually is much deeper than just run and gun missions. There's a story behind each contact, and the relationships between the contacts begin to form as you rise through the ranks. -The weapons and clothing (no armor, per say) really do set you in the mood of a city that breeds anarchy and violence. It's depicted so well on the criminal's gear, wild and more punk looking. The Enforcers however, look very rough and beaten, but very strong.  Cons: -Connectivity issues are a huge problem when it comes to their servers. Regardless of what computer you're on, you still seem to lag out and drive right into a wall, or run right into a room full of baddies. Eventually coming back to full connection dead and respawning. -Hackers. Oh my. Hackers. There are times when they get confused with people who pay to win, but I'll get to that. There are massive ban waves that the moderators do to wipe all hackers that they detect. However, it's an IP ban, which means simply changing your IP address will let you back in. I believe it's the three strike rule, and then your character is deleted from that game. Regardless, for every one good player there are two hackers, and they usually farm kills on low-level servers. -The leveling system (Reputation/Threat). This system is flawed, I believe, as when you start out you get a letter 'T' next to your name. This stands for Trainee, and that's where it ends. There is no closed tutorial, as you are learning from a menu that tells you what to do in the active game. No training wheels, kiddies, because you could go into matchmaking as a trainee and get paired against a gold or two, and be completely destroyed. This wouldn't be as frustrating as it is, if the system wouldn't go by threat level. It doesn't detect threat level until after 5-10 matches of pure hell and dying, which is what usually drives people away. -Pay to Win. Finally, we're here. Considering this game is F2P, I was overjoyed when I first entered. I looked past my many starting matches and hoped that I would eventually find something that I could latch onto and love...I was wrong. The guns and outfits for normal players are nice, and take a while to get (A while is doing repetitive missions for the same contact until you unlock that tier), buying from the ARMAS Marketplace is 10x better. I played for 40 hours normal, and I was struggling at best on a Bronze server. Bronze. Only a step up from Green when are literally entering servers. I have a fully decked out character after spending $40 in the marketplace because everything is so overpriced. Overpriced weapons for overpowered players.  I really wish I could reccomend, but finally, I cannot because of the frustrating issues that this game not only displays as 'learning the ropes and playing with a great community' but disagrees and actually begins to kick new players from parties who say anything bad about the community or the game.
6638	0	a	Cannot even play the game. My brother uses a PC with MUCH lower specs than mine and he can play with no issues minus slight lag but anytime I try and join the game it freezes right away. I can't even review any of the actual content because IT DOESN'T LET ME PLAY! Two thumbs down (-10)/10
3801	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game. Horrible community rife with cheaters, bare bones, barely functional gameplay, and horrible business practices on part of the developer and publisher. This game makes me cry everytime I play it and yet I keep playing it - perhaps because I've invested so much money in it. The only fun I have anymore is with the music studio and recreating my favorite songs in it. This game has dried up and I strongly urge anyone who hasn't already tried it to avoid it.

7527	0	a	AWFUL, AWFUL GAME. The controls are horrendously awkward, and the entire time playing it feels like a game that wants desperately to be Saints Row. The entire time spent playing is wondering what i am even supposed to do. It feels like Gmod Roleplay added some cars and said 'yep that looks about right' and then tried to sell you expansion packs for $100. Dont waste the time downloading it. Buy Saints Row instead and you will end up gett a better gameplay experience, a story line, and characters that dont feel like cardboard cut-outs with speakers taped on.
1163	1	a	Best Online Game Ever. If you like GTA series, then you would like this game too.
6955	0	a	APB Reloaded, what can I say. The game is pretty fun and there are alot of options with cars, guns and clothing but it becomes a little bit pay to win. I have 220+ hours on this game and that tells that I have played this game long enough to give my opinion. It is fun with a group of friends, but if you ar going to play it solo it will get boring (if you play it with friends it will also get boring) So sadly I dont reccomend this game even though this game KICKED â¥â¥â¥ back in 2011 when it became free to play (it wasnt free to play before 2011 you had to buy it as a disk and install the game with that) When u bought that u would get some G1C and a free gun for lifetime and some more things.  Theres nothing wrong with the game itself though but it became pay2win which is dissapointing.  Conclusion:  If you have some money to spend and some friends that can also spend some money (about 100$ for the tommygun) thats not the best weapon though but just and example then I would recommend this game, if not search for something else.

7517	0	a	The first impression is that you're in for an amazing experience. But the more you spend playing, the more you realise how much troublesome it is to play this game. Firstly, the servers are underwhelming. Secondly, the game is absolutely pay to win. I repeat, you WILL NOT be able to achieve ANYTHING WORTHWHILE in THIS DONKEY GAME unless you're willing to spend your whole monthly savings. A no from me.
5975	0	a	  I've played League of Legends and its community isn't as toxic as APB's community. Download this game if you're rich and want to spend a hella ton of money on this game, if you're not then you're better off downloading another game.  Sure this game can be fun but there's always a gold player that's going to anally â¥â¥â¥â¥ you with his grenades and cars.  But if you ignore all its faults and its rabid and toxic community, APB is a good game that is worth your while. Even if it's for a little bit.
10920	1	a	I used to be a lot more into this game before amulets of resurrection were removed. Also it makes me mad that they pretty much destroyed all my work. Hey! I worked hard for those ammies. So if ammies ever come back I will probably get back into this game as much as I was before but as of now it'll just be a game I will come back to every now and again or when a friend tells me to.
3303	1	a	I liked APB.. but didn't continue after a couple of plays.. simply becuase it lacked controller support. There were a few features I would have liked to have seen also.. radio stations, more solid single quest modes and not just MP, because if your just starting, single quests is where you learn your tools to play the mp. a more detailed customisation of char. but I havent played in around 2 years so maybe they have these features now.. if your Kb&amp;M and stuck for cash, it's F2P.. worth a tryout, if you don't like then no harm done.

3430	1	a	Nice game :)   Very deep customization, make your own unique Character, Clothes, Cars, logos, music themes etc.   You can buy permanent guns and clothing items in the Real money store, but all the guns in the store can be obtained free aswell from contacts just not permanent (7 days etc for ingame currency).  One of the best F2P games yet imo, but if youre thinking of starting to play now i would hold off until the upcoming Engine change.

2269	1	a	Is a fun game best to play with friends
4857	0	a	Good for the money (nothing) but it gets rather boring very quickly.  The game doesn't hold much for people not playing with friends, since it's either hard to communicate or you get stuck with a pack of people who don't know what they're doing.  Aside from that, premiums get very big advantages, including one shot weapons, which sort of removes the 'free to play' element.  If you've played everything else, and you want something for you and your friends, get it -- if there's something else, don't.
4183	0	a	I'm so glad to see people agree with me. Let me just give you guys my opinion on this sad little potential wasted game. On the outside, this game looks pretty good. It's true, you get to customize your character, do some fun things around the city and play games in teams with different objectives. Sounds good right? Nope. This game will constantly pester you to become a 'premium member', and if you do that, you get more money in game, and even get things like more tattoos. Premium members can have up to 50 tattoos. Guess how many normal players get? 3. THREE. And even if you do pay for premium, there are still other things you have to pay real money for if you want to enjoy the game, for instance, guns. The most important thing in this game. You'll find the guns you are given to start off are awful, but fair enough. You can buy guns with ingame money and 'joker tickets', which are a pain to get hold of, and the gun expires in 7 days after you've bought it, so you'll have to collect the funds to buy it again! You could buy guns with real life money of course, which are overpowered and very expensive. I thought this game is decent enough to maybe pay a little more, so I decided to check out the store. I found this gun I liked for Â£5. I thought, maybe as a one off. Then I looked and it said I'd only have it for 30 days. There IS an option to keep the gun forever, but guess how much that would be? Â£25! You could buy a whole new, better game out of that! And this is just for 1 gun, out of the wide variety of guns you can get. And the thing is, this game is not 'OUTSTANDING'. It seems like it could be a decent game, fairly fun (if you weren't getting constantly killed by those who do buy over powered gun), and worth playing, and maybe paying a little for. But it's just ridiculous how much you'd have to pay if you wanted to have a good time with this disappointment. Thank god GTA 5 and GTA Online is coming to PC.
7732	0	a	Complete pay-to-win. If you think this will be like GTA you will be sorely dissapointed. Save yourself the few gigabytes and don't bother with this game. 3/10
10144	1	a	Yes Its its a ummmmmm ya get it
1863	1	a	The game is really fun when played alone and with friends. Played the game for some time and really liked it. I recommend it to all fans of TPS games.

Unless you have every intent on hacking like most in this game.. then join with your hacking brothers!! Such a shame has great potential, But clearly made to make a few quid and close this one down like they did the first!! Cant give this a lower thumbs down if i tried 100% thumbs down!!
3292	1	a	its hard but thats what hard core gamers like, like me
4738	0	a	'lol what's a launcher? what's a registry? lol steam thinks you played it while i crahsed lololol' -The Game's Launcher  I wanted to play this game, since I thought it was a free alternitive to GTA V or something like that, so I got it, and installed the assets. When I clicked played, it gave me an error saying that the game could not load itself into the Windows Registry, then it quitted. Then I relaunched it. Stuck at the splash screen. Launched it again, at the launcher, clicked Play, it just quits, Steam does not register it as a crash, but a 'You played a game!' sort of deal. So I just gave up. Hopefully they will fix it.

4371	0	a	After 1,700 hours of the same repetitive actions, no cover system or evasion system, Hackers galore, I'm giving up on APB. The game feels like it does when it was in Beta. Hardly any changes at all (there are changes but nothing that makes the game 'better' just more weapons added on to Armas to milk the Cash Cow that this game has become). Utterly dissappointed I spent so many hours of my life playing this game when I could have been doing something more cnstructive with my life. I highly recommend all to stay clear of the Trap that is APB: Reloaded and invest your time and money into something worth wild, and better, Like DayZ, or stocks from NASDAQ.
9644	1	a	  I really enjoyed this RPG game and I enjoyed the first 10 seconds of the charecter creation. The problem I got is when I got to the part were you get your first rifle and you have to go to the Medical bay where the woman said they do operations I have 4 gbs and my frame rates dropped to 2 so I had to fight on 2 fps and I managed to win, I got outside THE VIEW WAS AMAZING!!!!!!!!
9822	0	a	I played it. Got renamed to a ridiculous name because my name offended the you know who. Then the same mod who had renamed me popped up in main chat to ask people to keep the discussion to game related Q&amp;A. I wasnt even chatting at the time, and the people who were were simply chit chatting. Apparently this is too much for this concentration camp of a game. No fun allowed. Only talk about the game.  I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hate this â¥â¥â¥â¥. Burn down every game company that manages its users like stupid cattle. God forbid giving personal details or talking about fun stuff. It might create you know, DISCUSSION. We dont want that. We want stupid morons who only talk about the game and pay their dues. Die. Eat it and die.
3570	1	a	alright cops and robbers game, dont expect much, not p2w though, star 556 is more than enough
1157	1	a	This game is so awesome in so many ways that I can't even describe, the customization system (amazing), graphics (pretty good) everything is good in this game but I would like the game to be patched because it still has some bugs so I really hope you get that fixed.
1530	1	a	Fun game, although you can get pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ sometimes.
797	1	a	1/10 Would not load again.
8408	0	a	While before I have gave this game a good rating, urging players to just give it a try. Well, that was back when the community was still pretty decent.   I base this review on my new experience, starting brand new character instead of playing as my old one.  Now, the community is just toxic. While I didn't notice any hacking of late, also did not get much time as people are quick to isolate and force out the 'noob', as I did not have easy access to good weapons when first starting. It is this kind of behavior that sickens me and will cause this games death as new players are instantly deterred and old players will simply stop playing.   Other than that, same as before, customization is in depth, still far beyond any other MMO I have tried. The driving mechanics feel like you are driving on ice though. And it is incredibly annoying, popping up my browser to open the store every time i switch districts.  I would not reccomend this to anyone anymore, which is tragic as me and my friends used to have a blast. Sorry, APB, it is time to move on.
3626	1	a	Great game but there's a lil delay when turning
4832	0	a	Got banned twice for cheating - R.A.T. mouse drivers. No contact with support, even that I spent some money on that game.
10856	1	a	Realm of mad god may have many microtransactions but there is no need to spend anymoney they give your 400g at the begining of the game to get you started so u can buy 1 item and gt the rest buying the items is not nessasary some arent even rare (and they cost like 5$) and you can trade items you dont need for items you want (pots are the best) so lvl up go kill god/dungeon bosses and get your loot

7414	0	a	I used to love this game when I didn't have many games to play, but after going back to it I have noticed how glitchy and also how extremely pay 2 win this game is. Also, it'd be wrong to call this game 'GTA online' but it has a lot of potential and I did enjoy this game a lot playing till midnight with mates on Skype.   But to sum it up, the game simply has reached a dead end, the playerbase is basically dead and the gliches and P2W aspects are just stupid.
302	1	a	another great game destroyed by hackers
865	1	a	It's a fun game, kind of like GTA, but not as sexual or 'rude'.  It could be fixed abit more, like things need to be more balanced (guns mostly), but over all earns a 4.5/5 stars by me.
2866	1	a	I loved this game, but i have a problem with it. Everytime i play APB Reloaded after around 2 or 10 minutes it Disconnected, I couldn't find the solution, What am i going to do? P/S : Sorry for Broken English
3947	0	a	APB Reloaded is a cops and robbers MMO that couldn't quite pull it off. The game has SO much potential that it almost makes me angry when they fall short on almost every game features. The lack of locational damage means accuracy is not needed. Combat often ends in a jumping match, and corner camping is one of the few strategies thanks to the third person camera.   The games micro transaction system and F2P model are majorly flawed. When buying guns in game you rent them allowing you to use it for a set amount of time before you have to rent it again. Buying an account bound weapon costs more but allows any of your characters to use it. This will run you anywhere from 20-55 dollars. You can also purchase character bound weapons for less, these cost about 10-40 dollars. When buying cars you can do the same rent, or own. An account bound car will run you about 15-35 dollars.   All of these prices can be discounted by owning a premium subscription.  Other premium benefits include a 20% off the cost of premium subscriptions, up to a 90% bonus to all Contact Standing (XP) Gains, 125% bonus to all Cash gains, 20% discount in the Armas Marketplace, 50% reduced cool down on activated abilities (Field Supplier / Nitro Booster), advanced access to Customization Suites (50 Symbols per Vehicle / Clothing item. 100 layers per Symbol), removal of in-game premium subscription advertising (which pops up at the end of every other mission), extended duration for Armas Trials for Weapon and Vehicle Trials.  Premium costs about 10 dollars for 30 days and gets cheaper the more time you buy. All in game prices are set in G1C which come in inconvenient amounts to make you buy more or additional packs. An example of this is a non-premium 1 month subscription costs 999 points. You can only get 999 points by buying spending $15 (1200 credits) because $10 is only 800 credits.  The best part of this 3rd person MMO shooter is the customization. While it is extremely limited as a non-premium user you can still add some flavor to your character or vehicle. Premium allows for you to create a truly unique look with 50 Symbols per Vehicle / Clothing item. At 100 layers per Symbol.   The in game missions are not over exciting and after playing for about 2-3 hours you will have played all of the available missions. Other players not in your mission are still in the world and can interact with you. They can do things like ram your vehicle or block you in buildings, but it is difficult for them to directly kill you.  The favored anti-cheat system of APB is Punkbuster. This program doesn't work very well at all and allows hackers to run rampant. In my short amount of play time I had encounter roughly 1 hacker per hour.  Overall this game has such a great idea, yet such terrible terrible execution in nearly everything the developers tried to do. 
324	1	a	Great Game, a FEW!!! back hackers though, still a fun and game i would highly recomend to try or even to get addicted to!
9558	0	a	Literally one of the worst MMO's I have ever played. Graphics are bad, UI is terrible, questing is boring, gameplay in gerneral is lackluster.

8391	0	a	I spent some hefty time with this game, even before it was on steam. It was bad before, and now, worse. I just installed it again today and tried 3 matches. All 3, all Premium vs Non-premium. The animations are still choppy, awkward, with no improvement. Graphic overall, still unpolished as it was 2 years old. The only reason I can possibly think of for one to spend time in this game is for its customization system, but that thing is soo restricted for non-premium (like ridiculously resticted). This is a perfect example of a failed Free to Play model. Don't play this unless you're willing to invest alot of real money, otherwise, you will not have a good time against premium players with all their boons.

9422	0	a	I had several problems with this game the first being the graphics. The graphics were so bad that I had to use a graphics card and turn the settings all the way up just to be able to see anything other than my charcter. The second problem I had was with the controls they are a little odd because you have to change between 1st and 3rd person constantly. 3rd person for movement and everything else, and 1st person for using your weapon. The final problem I had was driving the vehicles, the first time I drove I barely bumbed a wall in what I think was an atv exploded and killed me.   I wouldnt recommend this game but it is free so why not.

4634	0	a	Unfortunately I'm going to have to say this with a heavy heart. I do not recommend APB Reloaded. I put a lot of hours into this game and while it can be irritating it is really fun; but here's the kicker: once you're leveled up enough you then deal with hackers. In order to continue to play and actually have any decent fun, you need to hack yourself. It sounded dumb and at first and I did not believe the person who told me so I kept playing. But over the next couple of days I realized he was right. Not only do the players hack but while I played all the servers were hacked as well and these actions made it almost unplayable. The idea is great and the gameplay is great; but all the constant hacking done do this game ruins the fun. If it weren't for the hackers I'd highly recommend this game.

2525	1	a	A great game with alot of good weps and armor, Alot of players enjoy playing this BUT there are too much wall glitchers which stay there and kill people as a bounty. This game is A bit of PTW (Pay To Win) Needs to add Good snipers with Ingame money.  But as always, i love this game, it is so much fun, enjoy.
200	1	a	If you like games similar to GTA Vice City you will love this game. In my oppinion APB reloaded is like the Grand Theft Auto games (GTA3 and after) except it has what we've always wanted, Multiplayer. Customize your character and cars and unlock/upgrade your guns through a level/rank system. I think its a great game and recommend it.
1256	1	a	i dont even know how to start up the game LOL!
10891	1	a	It's really a fun and addictive games
4788	0	a	This game is a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ worthless dont even waste your time â¥â¥â¥â¥ing trash â¥â¥â¥ game no wonder why its free its free for a reason
5386	0	a	I used to love this game. It was a 'cheap' GTAV. I was thrilled, I could play a game just like GTAV for free!  It's never that simple.  I spent around 200 dollars on in-game items. It would of been cheaper just to buy GTAV.  There's a reason 'hacking' is a popular tag for this game. Also, there's some odd obsession with naked anime girls here. Not that that's a bad thing.
6942	0	a	THIS GAME SUCK LAGGY AS â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥ HOLE PLAYERS O/10
6906	0	a	Game won't load. But I wouldn't say its bad. Just putting thumbs down because it won't start up.
7718	0	a	i hate this
10258	0	a	Probably the worst Post Apocalyptic Survival i have played. So much lag, graphics are completely terrible, i noticed a lot of hacking as well along with overpowered enemies and you have to put tons of money into the game to be able to get anything good. As of all the game is not worth it, it is a waste of time and space.  2/10 i would say to be honest, The game has achieved to be on steam and has gotten many players to play it. But everything is off on it completely. And also to add the website is off 80% of the time and so is the main server. (I have played for a whole day\24 hours and it still sucks â¥â¥â¥...)
8589	0	a	Was a decent game at one point in time, now is full on Pay To Win and everyone is Level 100+. Also Controls feel like crap, wasn't too bad when the game was fun but now it's very noticeable.
5084	0	a	i accidentally left this game open while sleeping
10871	1	a	Probably one of the best games i play, If you play it take some time don't quit instantly get some items and into the game before you decide.
5633	0	a	this game is awsome ranging to 100% custom gear/cars to heated combat and a very origanal plot but theres just one thing it recomends alot of stuff im talking about 4 gigs of ram they should of put at LEAST 6 gigs THIS GAME IS A MEMORY HOG!! many people notice that there computer heats up almost everybody wellmy game will turn off at random oh did i metion IT SHUTS DOWN MY WHOLE COMPUTER not just the game the whole system i would play this game to death if it wasent for tha one thing.
9005	1	a	After playing this game for 1000+ hours I can finally make a statement.  Pros: - made lots of friends, - had fun for a few weeks,  Cons: - outdated graphics, - juvenile and trolling player base, - balanced PvP? BAH! Forget PvP if you use rifles or pistols. - late game is definietly a money sink. If you don't pay, forget about the Alpha zone or later areas.  Still recommend it as a friend finding application :).  Edit: You can craft grilled prairie chicken. 11/10
10855	1	a	really stupid, fun game
4799	0	a	I tried loving it, gave it so many chances but in the end I just cant bring myself to play it anymore
3222	1	a	great game ive always wanted grand theft auto v but this can work the same as it so yeah 
3849	0	a	This game is very demanding and ohh would you look at that a storm broke out outside my house,its far more interesting than this game.
9718	0	a	Way too hard to understand, full of 100's of hard to follow tutorial, and unclear instructions. During my 0.7 hours i play, i achieved 3 deaths, a couple of kills(NPC's) and litreally nothing else. I tried extremely hard to find a storyline, or quest but could only find one's i needed higher levels for. 3/10
6368	0	a	I think I might have cancer.
6256	0	a	today this game is pay2win.. y dont need skill anymore in this game y have use moneyz
6705	0	a	if you like constant run ins with cheaters/aimbotters/wallhacking all that crap then this is the game for you, if not steer away from it they have punkbuster but it doesnt do anything cheaters run rampant and on the weekends they are ever present G1 doesnt do anything to stop them either or even try
891	1	a	After playing this game I strongly recommend you to play this game and not read any of the non recommended games. To me personal this game is like every other game hard at first but you get the hang of it and it becomes fun! Whats a game without challenge!! Besides, it's free whats their to lose? I strongly recommend this game to anyone! A fun GTA 5 like Game with a good servers that are almost all the time full with 100 people!
7860	0	a	worst game ive ever played i cant even play it because every time u have to sighnin
5292	0	a	This game originally failed because of core problems that existed in the game and the complete ineptitude of the developers (when they were Real Time Worlds) to fix or at the very least alleviate these problems.  Now on top of those issues you have an utterly broken cash shop system that will ruin your experience 95% of the time.  To start I should address some of the original problems that plagued the game on it's original releaes, guns were (and still are) terrible to use and the application of modifications does not make that any better. The gunplay feels clunky and the recoil on most weapons make it impossible to hit anything less than 5 feet infront of you. that is unless you use specifc weapons.  Cars are in the same boat as guns, for a cops and robbers MMO, you think they would be able to get the driving down. This is not the case. The car physics are terrible and they don't control that great either.  The mission system is absolute garbage, you can follow through multiple objectives, winning one after another. but if you fail the final one (, you will instantly, ignoring the fact taht you and your side were dominating the opposition;; fail the entire mission (And I find this happens more for the enforcer faction than the criminal faction, in all my time playing). This is further problematic with the addition cash shop weapons.  Now your thinking: Wow, hopefully the new developer and publishers would of picked up this game up and would of tried to fix these issues, which while do not make the game unplayable, do not provide an enjoyable experience for prolonged periods of time.  Well, no. They ignored these issues.  And I haven't even mentioned the games instability, poor performance even with modern hardware. or the failure for the game to completely shut-down once your done playing (One of the processes used in the game will ALWAYS STAY UP).  What they did bring to the game. was one of the worst things they could of done. They added a cash shop for guns, no no, not cosmetics. these guns have an actual performance advantage over other guns that you can actually aquire through gameplay.  These wonderful items provide superior damage, little to no recoil in addition to some other effects they can provide.  This damages the poor mission matchmaking and balancing because if your enemy team has these weapons, and you don't well, your screwed. in laymans terms.  Now to be fair, the new devs have actually added some content in the game with the addition of the 'Chaos district' and in game events. These aren't that great though, they aren't even the quality of the RTW content (Which isn't that great either), and the events are hampered by people rampantly cheating. Which I forgot to mention, is incredibly commonin this game (from outright use of hacks, to exploiting faults with the game or going out of bounds.)  the only positive thing I can say about the game is it's customisation system. and, unfortunately ,that hasn't seen any improvements since release of the ORIGNAL release. There is very little added to customise yourself since then (that that which is added is cash shop items -- go figure.) and while the emblem creator is nice and all that, if you don't have the ability to use it (since you cannot import emblems and pictures, you use geometric shapes to create them) thats just a wasted feature, and you will be dependant on the auction house to find anything you want. Which is ALSO an issue since people find it prudent to sell their crap for stupid huge amounts of money, and you can't filter or search by name of what your looking for. so if you want anything past 'T' for example. be prepared for LE EPIC TROLL FACE MEME XDDD!!! for the next 40 pages.  To sum this up: If your looking for a GTA MMO, this isn't that. go play GTA instead, if your looking for a fun Free-to-Play game, this Definitely isn't for you. becuase this game is by no means 'Free' and it's not fun either. I tried to cover everything I experience in my time playing this game, I probably missed something that would make me go for another 5 paragraphs. so it's best to stop here.  TL;DR: Games â¥â¥â¥â¥, p2w garbage. devs don't give a crap about the game and army of cheaters, go play some other game.
1366	1	a	This game is Heaven for all PvP'ers and MMO players
2361	1	a	Best gangster dress-up simulator I have ever played.
9454	0	a	its way to dark not even the britness hepled it #poo face 
10139	0	a	This game is complete garbage
3876	0	a	super pay to win and new players have no chance at all. if you havn't already be playing this game for months don't even bother with it it will only frustrate you 
2304	1	a	Meh, got it to play with a mate, plus its free so cant complain.
8073	0	a	I don't like writing bad reveiws. I am saying a no on my recommendation,(The little hand thingy),but I am saying yes at the same time. It is a very good idea of a game. It was developed well,the idea is good,and they came through with the idea. But the bad part is that it is a PAY TO WIN. I mean,come on. You have more gun verieties than GTA(From what I've seen,but you can buy them with real money,or rent them. Really I would only spend money on this game if I just had EXTRA money on my account that I have no other use for. To recap,the game itself was good,but any customisation that you actually want to look good (That's not basic) you have to invest money into. I would highly recomend this game if they change their Pay To Win ways.
2876	1	a	yes great game 
7246	0	a	Game used to be fun. I've been a player since about 2013. Got some ups and down, but it was mostly fun. Today, as I come back to play with my friend and wait for the upcoming halloween event, I get perma banned for 'breaking the terms and service'. How can someone break the rules of the game if they haven't played in 3 months? Really sad as this game was really fun, and they are now banning innocent players for others crimes.
6093	0	a	I really liked it. I was able to get kills in some cases. But it's Pay2Win. Gotta admit it. It's not an actual F2P game so, misleading tags?
7519	0	a	Not that great.
9781	0	a	I'd recomend it, but the Devs are lazy â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s that only care about money, and not the players. They won't get up off their lazy asses and update the game, as the graphics are outdated, and it's full of bugs and glitches, leveling up it painfully slow (at least for me, anyways) it lags like a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, and there's loads of spammings in the help chat when you are trying to ask a question if you're at the time when Cylen isn't on.   However there's the good side. You can get helpful players that get bored of the game, and go around helping people. The missions aren't too hard wth a friend, and it's really helpfull to join clans, ecxept some can have control freak â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s as leaders, so it's best to join a small clan, as this way it's all closer and easier to communicate with clan members.  Pro's:   Helpful players  Nice missions  Addicting  Con's:  Lazy Devs will never update this game again  Graphics outdated  Full of Bugs  Leveling up is painfully slow  Lags like a baws  Spammers and adbots in chat   My rating: 4/10 
10357	0	a	game sucks balls
5552	0	a	It is â¥â¥â¥â¥ you can get banned for nothing Dont waste your time
3160	1	a	I love this game and the fairness it provides to all players. Looking for a fun fair game with instant gameplay? This is it. It's like GTA V without limits. Play with me on the 'Colby' Server and be a criminal- my name is Drakonite; pm me!
6854	0	a	Before, this game was great. Good community, good updates. Now it's the complete opposite.  Unless you want to play the same thing over and over, same mission and what not, go ahead. But it's as bland as plain oatmeal. Usually the maximum of 7 people on fighting districts. The only thing that's good is the exit button.
9305	1	a	I like this game a lot! I have played the Fallout series and it is simliar to this. Graphics are nice and there are tons of recipes. There is a lot of reading involved and you have to follow what the charecters diretions well.
3072	1	a	seriously, wtf are you doing reading this? PLAY THIS GAME!!  APB is an online 3rd person â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t simulator.  Hours of fun can be had and sometimes you just cant help yelling 'â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥T!' at your screen as you get your â¥â¥â¥ handed to you.  Though nothing beats the feeling of rolling in a car through the city with some good friends who you know got your back.
10885	1	a	It's one of the greatest games I've played lately - it's addicting and interesting... sure I might not be the best at it but it's worth the time to try.
2689	1	a	for those who are fans of playing TPS-type games, or you're just looking for something new....this game right here? totally worth it.

2997	1	a	People say this game is Pay To Win... But it's not, when i started to play this game i killed people that had Payed items which wasn't that difficult, However if you save money like me you can get really cool and good stuff from the shops in the game. For example if you spend real money on to the game its just giving stuff that looks better and its upgraded little bit too. I played this game for few hours and i am so close to get a really good car without spending no real life money. Hope this changed your mind about this game. :)
8537	0	a	Game used to be great in the past....used to play it ALL the time. I mean ALL THE TIME! But things have changed.. Back in the day you had to have actual skill and had to grind to get the most op of weapons and whatnot...these days you've got lvl 9's ( starting rank ) using an Orange weapon and then dominating the whole match with it....Then there is the Nano..the most overpowered weapon in the game and the sad part is low ranks use this to get Gold threat..oh and did I mention the OCA Whisper? Then you have the Developers...they don't give a damn about the game other than adding more P2W â¥â¥â¥â¥ and then adding in 'Events' like kill these many people with a specific weapon and get â¥â¥â¥â¥....they add absolutely nothing new to the game ( like they used to back in 2013-2014 )... Just play it, buy an Orange weapon and BOOM! you're a pro with no skills...From me this is going to be a sad No due to the MAJOR P2W the game has got
5172	0	a	When this game was first released (before being 'Reloaded'), I had really high hopes for this game. The videos of game play and the character creator looked amazing.  But this game fails on every front. The character creator is miserable to use, the interface lags and sometimes glitches, and the models are of the poorest texture quality. In fact, it was so miserable trying to make a character, that I quit and uninstalled the game before I ever got into the world.  Only GTA5 has a worse character creator. (But everything ELSE about that game at least makes up for it.)  It's free, so if you doubt me, go ahead and try it. The only thing you have to lose is your time.
814	1	a	This is my favorite game ! But you can add some new events like races clan battles or something like this!
2482	1	a	An entertaining rage game, I find. Taps into very strong team playing skills when versing strong or large teams. Some missions might have the same objectives but will never play out the same way, the wide range of guns and play styles insures that no 'camp spot' is impossible to defeat. Orgainzation and teamwork can win any fight, you just need to be more orgainzed and strong team then the opposition. Even with team mates the occational hacker can make the game tiring. Can also be demanding on older computers as I recently fixed! XD
1393	1	a	It's true that this game is Pay to Win and it's not exactly newb friendly.  But if you manage to ignore the many deaths you have and just continue playing the game just to have fun instead of trying to win everything, you're in for some lots of fun.  Now I know this game is unfair at the most. But play this game long enough and just ignore all the deaths you get. Sure enough you'll get decent equipment so you won't die so much.  You just have to have patience guys. Also, bring a friend if you can.
3227	1	a	Stands for Action Police Brain.
662	1	a	From the first 10 minutes of playing, I knew I'd love this game
3568	1	a	I would definately recommend this game to everyone but please apb PLEASE do major updates dont disapoint your community you have lost loads of fans by that
10818	1	a	DECA GAMES.... I have been a realm player for a long time and have been enjoying the game for years... kabam made me sad and i can't wait to see you make realm great again ;) Love you and hope you succeed
7761	0	a	my pc meets all requirements but it still doesn't work
6646	0	a	Sorry but this is a joke, after many hours of downloading, it installed and started updating which was fine by me, seemed normal, until the update got to 100% and nothing happened, it started saying 'installing Direct X' which i obviously already have. After maybe 20 minutes of confusion i looked around the steam forums, followed some advice, but this time when i clicked play, it bought up the same download window and just started downloading something different. After this it successfully ended, however the game STILL won't play. It either does nothing or says the application is already running (which it isn't.)  Pretty disgraceful, i downloaded Left 4 Dead 2 without a problem and it works fine. APB seems to be severely fukced. I know it's free to play but you still expect it to actually work after the installation progress.   EDIT: Just found out that on this game you have to pay REAL LIFE money for IN GAME guns, games like this should be ended. Money grabbing bull****.  ANOTHER EDIT: So yeah since this i've downoaded many games via Steam, none had any sort of problem what so ever, games i've downloaded and am able to run normally include Rust, Outlast, The Forest, Next Car Game, Battlefield 3, the list goes on, APB goes in the â¥â¥â¥â¥ list with gaming atrocities like Velvet Sundown who wouldn't even run.
5201	0	a	STAY AWAY!!!!  This game have a really newb hostile community in its core.... **********************************************************************  I have been playing this for about 4 days now. In those 4 days i experienced,  a lot of hostility towards new players from highlevel players.  I was trying to get my wife into the game too, so i went afk for about 15 secs (in a mission) because she needed my help. when i came back to my screen, i had a really hostile whisper from a team mate, because he had seen me stand still.   I ignored it and resumed our mission, now that same guy started to TK me, and when i asked him why he did that i got 'because you are dumb' Again i I ignored him and tried to resume the mission, but he kept TKing me for the rest of the mission.  Now the mission was over and freindly fire went off, the guy started stalking me and yelling stuff about my mothers â¥â¥â¥â¥ in the global voice chat.  Another episode i had, when i joined a mission was another highlevel player, he started whispering me about my in hes opinion sucky weapon choice. I replied that i just took down 2 of the enemy team with my sucky gun.. but i was assured that it was luck.   After a while the same guy is telling us newbs in the team chat that we should â¥â¥â¥â¥ off the the bronze district and ruin the missions there instead.  Yet another episode was yesterday, when i joined a mission with 3 gold ranked players, all from the same clan (WASP) one of them ran me over with hes car, i asked him why he did that, he replied 'â¥â¥â¥â¥ you, you dont look where you walk' so when tried to return to the mission objective they all 3 started TKing me, and i was told that they liked to shoot low lvl players, so they ended up hunting me around the map untill the mission was ended.
89	1	a	good game just waiting for a mac version!
10209	0	a	dont play this  its okay but not as worth your time as some other similar games
10811	1	a	This game is a lot of fun, it may seem very simplistic at first, but once you begin playing its a very rage indusing but rewarding expierience. Would reccomend to any gamer.
10305	0	a	Not very good. Even for free. Not worth the time.
1009	1	a	this is in a way a online grand theft game... but i like it more you get to drive cars/kill people steal and other fun â¥â¥â¥â¥. in a way its pay to win but you can win with out ingame â¥â¥â¥â¥ :P
7975	0	a	It's like GTA    Except it is not GTA    Just get GTA
10774	1	a	-=WARNING THIS GAME IS FOR PEOPLE THAT CAN HANDLE DYING=- This game is extremely fun, but you will die ALOT. This game is permadeath..sorta. You see when you die you lose all the items you had equiped but there is a vault witch keeps your stuff between characters in the chest. Witch means you always dont want to equip your best gear because your afraid of dying.i have only just finished getting to lv20 for the 3rd time and after that dont go running to gods rightaway you want to stay back do enough damage to get loot. Players in RotMG have a thing called 8/8 it means 8 out of 8 of thier sts are maxed. To max a stst you have you get sts potions witch drop from gods yet since your not 8/8 its very difficult to do. If your new to this game dont go asking people for stuff or YOU WILL BE YELLED AT. Overall this is a very good game but very difficult to 'beat'. I give this game a 8/10 for its very fun gamplay and the community that comes with it.
5389	0	a	This Game IS free 2 play, trust me :)
9125	0	a	Um.. Where to even begin....    Pros;   -Free -Easy to learn -Good for teaching / good first game to get into if youre trying to learn how to games -Doesnt take up much space -Runs really well / Isnt CPU nor GPU sensitive      Cons;  -Poor/Uninteresting/Generic Story -Looks like... Well, Pixel games are better. -Extremely repetitive/boring gameplay. -Enemies have the skill and threat of a one legged kangaroo. -Theres only like... One of each type of gun. (Im serious...) -PayToEnjoy.
767	1	a	The game is nice, but in total ITS A PIECE OF â¥â¥â¥â¥
5786	0	a	If you download this game you will find 3 important things: LAG,CHEATERS, and, the most important of all, UNINSTALL BUTTON.  Just...nope, it doesn't deserve to be played
2223	1	a	takes a long time to load but it is fun 
6856	0	a	used to be my favorite games before... but later in 2013 they ruined everthing, starting from the weapons they make the normal weapons do less range and damage from the weapon u buy from the market using real money, the lags, the random kicking in the middle of mission by punkbuster, and the worst part is the hacker that didnt get banned because they friends of the GM or they spent money on premium. now im gone for good. (colby player)
9926	1	a	Simply one of the best MMO's. It's complicated enough to get rid of all the kids. And not too complicated to keep it at a Mature level. This game is for grown ups who want to use some brain while doing things instead of just hitting 2 buttons and changing looks.
10451	1	a	The game is great when you play with friends. Me and my buddy's never play the game alone. As soon as we where all home from school/work ect we would play. Goof game when you are with friends
8912	1	a	Cool game to play with your friends/roleplay/explore. The world is pretty cool and the crafting system is neat but it's also a bit grindy. Would recommend for people who like to grind or roleplay with their friends. THANK YOU.
1465	1	a	Fun game with my friends .
1698	1	a	hea :)
9527	1	a	this game is an epic adventure/survival game that will eliminate all other free to play games on steam. most defanantly worth getting it. Especialy because its a free to play game.
8212	0	a	Spent the last 3 hours tring too install its 'Game Files' and it can't even run the application.. I recieved a Steam Error when it tried to run.. Don't download, the game makes your download a lot of other bloatware which the game itself doesn't need.
8400	0	a	its bad... granted ive only played for about 2hrs, but.... its so bad. cars? bad. players? bad. Community? really bad. when driving a car, trying to steer the bloody thing takes forever, like turning a yaught or however you spell that. its guns are generic and you'll easily die if you didnt pay for any new guns. it doesnt matter if your on either side, both sides will team kill for â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥'n'giggles. its just bad... so bad 
8786	0	a	Would have recco'd but takes for ever to update Engine scene is dead. VVGT
7934	0	a	This game wont even start and i know people would say its my computer but the launcher doesnt even show up it just flashes black then nothing happens
6473	0	a	game will not even play, says apb failed to initialize physx??? game wont play at all. i have a gtx 980 i7 4790k and still wont play
3791	0	a	A joke of a game, when all is said and done about the game.  The game offers a lot that many other games do not, meaning it's near endless levels of customization from your character, to your vehicles and your weapon (albeit pre-made skins upon your weapon.) The gun game, whilst often subject to horrid servers is satisfying, regardless of it's Call of Duty-like TTK (Time To Kill) meaning that most fire-fights will be over very swiftly. The game suffers from a plethora of issues however, and many of them are game-breaking.  There is a heavy influence of cheaters in the game, and they are not removed appropriately quickly due to the anti-cheat measures put into the game prioritizing microtransactions from the cheaters instead of increasing the quality of the game by banning them as quickly as possible - which is a very shady practice seeing how it's a lose-lose situation.  The community is probably the most toxic and vile you can find. I have never seen such a hateful community anywhere else which directly affects gameplay as you will find many people griefing your mission and other missions just for the fun of it for them. This is also why it is almost impossible to stream this game and have a remote amount of viewers, as many will target you for griefing.  The development behind the game is barely there, and they also do very shady practices. They falsely ban players with zero evidence of them cheating or the like, or simply ban them because they receive too many reports about the players without checking into their playstyle and seeing if they are good, or cheaters. GMs are non-existant, they are very few and very rarely around - even when they display themselves, they hardly do anything against blatant cheaters.  The development team has zero clue about the metagame, what should be fixed and what should not be fixed, along with pretending some things are not an issue - server issues being a particular subject they prefer to avoid.   If you have a severe case of masochism, it is worth trying out. I have played it for many hours, and I have an entire channel dedicated to the game on YouTube. If you want a game that is as new player hostile as Dwarf Fortress without one ounce of it's depth, this is it. This game breaks friendships faster than Mario Party 2.  If you want to play a third person shooter that's free to play and something to just calm down to, I would probably keep looking elsewhere.
8686	0	a	just going to say this right â¥â¥â¥â¥ing now, do not waiste your time downloading and playing this game, its worse than â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hitler
8665	0	a	When I saw videos of this game I thought it looked fun. I was wrong, I'm not paying just to get a in-game gun, car, clothing item or anything like that. No more pay to win games for me!
7122	0	a	I think you should probably take this game off Steam. â¥â¥â¥â¥ing used 5 Gb of my data &amp; the game didnt even start.

7488	0	a	Alright, so I downloaded this in 2 hours. I was all happy about playing. Started playing, I loved customization, but then, when it came to playing, it was horrible, Enforcers are OVERPOWERED, with the stun guns, it's impossible to play. Don't waste time. Play some real things instead.

8508	0	a	Was tempted to play the game after watching some gameplay. The only thing in the beginning that had me a little uninterested was the fact that there were people running around in weaboo outfits but that's just a small personal issue. After playing it with a friend for a few hours it was pretty clear that grenades were a fan favorite. Didn't have fun at all, we were going against players who were 'Max Prestige' I never cared to look at how the leveling works but that seems to be pretty damn high. First review I have done on a game and my butt hurts so much from this weaboo-grenade mess of a game.
5829	0	a	The game was fun while it lasted, arresting people, clan war all that stuff was fun, however, two things ruined it; One, the game became very pay to win. I mean, you could play and still kill SOME people, but if someone has a gun that cost 3.99 and you've got your little peashooter, you're dead meat.  Two, and this is the main thing, and if it gets fixed, I'll come back to playing it, and I may be tempted to pay some money, but this really isn't easy to fix. Here goes: The game has a few servers, one for newbies, one for casuals, and one for veterans. The problem is that casuals and veterans will repeatedly get themselves killed to lower their rank, and then they gang up on the newbies. Yes, people are that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. They think their big and bad when they do that, and they call everybody 'Noob!' and think they're good.  Overall, I think the game is really awesome, but until they find a way to keep veterans away from the casuals and newbies, the game is unplayable. You can't even get better, because you're litteraly dead within seconds.
4171	0	a	current state of this game ? -waste of time. not even worth a long review
8519	0	a	This game is full of cheaters. RIP Do not waste 5 gig on this â¥â¥â¥â¥.
69	1	a	This game is literally crack. It will addict you and eat your soul. 10/10 would smoke
4610	0	a	The game is a cheat fest at this point, and the developers do nothing about it. I wouldn't recommend playing it unless you're a revenge hacker.
2064	1	a	i dont care about the rating or other reviews. this game is what i'd call the second gta 5 online. its great and its for the computer which i'd call a cool game so argue all u want about this i still say this needs more people
6785	0	a	PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK  The game is filled with foul-mouthed creatures that, if you have very, very low patience, will infuriate you to no end. Despite the multitude of weapons available for free-to-play players, the best weapons you'll find will be either in the in-game marketplace costing ridiculous amounts (yes, i'm looking you all who expect so much for such a simple weapon) or in Armas Marketplace which costs real money. The lag is terrible, causing rubberbanding effect, which is very, very annoying in and out of missions. Not to mention higher level players invade the lower level ones and calls people who can't shoot them down losers or noobs. Matchmaking is bad. Low level players are often pitted against higher ranking ones.  It's not a bad game, all in all. Like many other MMORPGs, it is plague with many problems. On the up side, this game has by far the best customization I've seen out there. It's just insane with how many things you can do that you will literally spend hours just to design your clothes. There's always a lot of action going on and different faction-specific tasks you can do.  I don't recommend this game for casual players. However, if you are a fan of profanity, hours of dressing up your toon just to shoot the hell out of people, then feel free to play it.

4122	0	a	If you are not willing to spend $1500.00 on the game then dont get it. Its a P2P community where the kids cant earn anything so they steal their moms credit card and buy all the more powerful weapons.   While the players who want to play without putting any real money into the game have to use crappy guns with crappy accuracy, and the only way to get anything decent (Which you can only have for a short period of time) takes months of grinding. Ive played this game for 119.3 hrs and only gotten just over $17000.00 ingame cash. Which doesn't get you anything good if you were wondering.   This game is a waste of time and there are many other games out there that beat this one in overall performance and quality of the community, I give this game a -100 out of 10 due to its lack of free to play compatability ingame and its lack of a mature and friendly community, all I see in this game is a bunch of rich 10 year olds who get their parents to give them $500 allowance a week to spend on this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game.  For your own sake and the sake of you're mental ability to play and have fun.   Dont download this game, play minecraft or something, which overall is a million times better than this â¥â¥â¥â¥ show.

3734	1	a	Good game considering it's free. Fun if played with friends but solo is boring
4889	0	a	This game is a giant Microtransaction. It revolves around your purchases and is the essence of P2W. This game had such potential, but they devs turned it into a disgusting sack of â¥â¥â¥â¥ that I will never touch again. I Can't complete any missions without some naked â¥â¥â¥â¥ running around with a Golden LMG and RPG between her cleavage while I'm stuck with an Anti-Material rifle that shoots Butter and Chick Peas. The community is toxic, too. I've only met 1 nice person, and he was P2W, too. I understand why you need to add Microtransactions, but, for the love of all that is holy and untainted, don't make the Premium â¥â¥â¥â¥ TOO OP. Learn from Valve. They made TF2, which you can play for nothing. You can best everyone without paying a single penny. It's not constantly shoving 'Deals' and 'Special Offers' into your â¥â¥â¥ all the time. The vehicle mechanics are Pretty decent, though, (Kudos :3) but it feels like the tires are coated with Cillit Bang Bleach, Translucent Vasaline and Lemon Lube mixed with spit. I played this back in 2013, and Only recently got back to it. Still hasn't changed. (Neither does war. :3) I have nothing else to procrastinate about, because I wanna go watch some Animemes, so i'll tell you a story of what happened in APB Reloaded to me.  I Load into the Financial District, excited to see what had changed, When I pressed K By accident and got shot into a Mission faster than the Speed of Light. I was put into a Vehicle Drop-off mission with someone with the Default 'CPA In Training' Shirt and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ trousers, and a Battle-hardened P2W Girl who was, pretty much, butt naked with an RPG and Golden .44 Squished between her crack and cleavage. I was stuck with the normal STAR 556 at the time, so â¥â¥â¥â¥ my life.  We got into our Cars, the Newbie's being the first car you get, and the P2W Girl's being something that popped out of a Tron Movie that had morphed with the General Lee from the Dukes of Hazzard. I had something that resembled a Dark-grey Golf GTI, and we set off. Little did we know that they were lying in wait.  As soon as I turned the corner to get the Vehicles, I was bombarded my Bullets and Cooked grenades. I felt like I was in a Video made by FRANKIEonPCin1080p (I Love his channel :3). I pressed onwards, but my car was shredded up within 5 seconds because of someone with, what looked like, a Portable .50 Caliber Heavy Machine Gun firing from a roof opposite to me. I made a run for it, and managed to get behind cover, but someone was there. Waiting. They busted a cap into my buttcheeks with some Futuristic Asiimov Rifle from Battlefield 4's New DLC, 'The Piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ future'. The P2W Girl on our side had gone behind the enemy, and had blown her into space, creating the ABP Space Program as she did so. I was feeling the adrenaline. I jumped into my car and sped to get the pick up, when... all of a sudden...  I got Teamkilled by the P2W Girl. And we lost. I then proceeded to drink Brake Fluid for a Panzershrehkt Tank Destroyer, which destroyed my Organs. And i Died.  Fortunately, I got better.  I'm basically saying that this game is a waste of time and money.
10775	1	a	If your looking for a great rpg mmo rogue like feature game THEN this ones for you, having over 200 hours on record the game still doesnt get old, having the feature to play a different character everytime is ideal for people who get bored easily, I recommended this game to any Steam player. 10/10
151	1	a	Amazing game for a Free To Play
8403	0	a	First of all good idea , but everything else sucks. Glitching, buged, can't drive a car properly from the latency.
3805	0	a	Gold players invade bronze servers to get their ranks up, not to mention at any time, you can go onto the store, buy the most OP weapon and use it forever and ever. Unplayable, unfair trash excuse of a game.
10291	1	a	this game would be fun if it work 
3686	1	a	I'm just gonna write basic Pros and Cons of the game, but in general I'm definitely a fan.  Pros: - Awesome customization, sliders to customize face and body in anyway you want, also available customization for clothes and cars. - Fast paced - Cops vs robbers / good vs bad theme - Easy lvl up as a Criminal - Great to play with a group of friends  Cons: - Devs abandoned the game for quite some time (originally APB), now we have APB: Reloaded (which is now slightly abandoned also) - Community usually quite arrogant to newcomers, and despite it being a 18+ game quite imature people. Dont expect immediate help being a newbie in this game, or at any point. - The side that has less players online is harder to play for - Harder to lvl up as enforcer (which is a bit unfair) - Hackers... (usually enforcers, but ocassionaly criminals).  (Not all pros and cons are listed (obviously), those are just the ones that I notice the most (and that I care more about))  But, you should try it, if you don't mind the cons.
5831	0	a	Love the idea of this game. What I don't like is that it feels like playing counter strike. Everyone spends their time jumping up and down to avoid bullets. And the initial load up procedure is horrible.
766	1	a	PAY2WIN BUT IT FUN
5403	0	a	field field field warnning dont play this game if you dont want to kill youre self and always be angry this game is full of cheaters 60% of this game using cheates because all of them can make a fake account with 10min emails and use their cheates without gamersfrist ban they real accounts this game dont have any ip ban so if someone use cheates and anti cheate ban him he can make a new acc and use their cheates.  its one of many problems of this game other is: 1:this game have fps problem in the battels youre fps randomly go 10 from 90 im playing bf4 but i dont have fps prbolem so my pc is so good but i have fps drops on this game. 2:this game was not a p2w game in 3 years ago i played this game but now mrs tiggs make this game a full p2w game with many p2w weapons cars and perimums. but immportant is so many cheaters is already playing on this game this game have only one anti cheate and that is fairfight but they cant find any cheaters agin:D so i really dont reacommend this game for you guys i think soon this game lose all their players and everyone can see servers empty
2777	1	a	Awsome game. Awsome when alone and even better when playing with about 2 friends.
5352	0	a	JUST READ IT BEFORE YOU PLAY. THIS WILL SAVE YOU FROM A MENTAL BREAKDOWN  F UCK.THIS.S HIT. DONT PLAY THIS GAME IF YOU VALVUE YOUR SANITY.At first this game was awesome alright, having fun doing good stacking up the g's. Now my first thing i want to say is that there is A F UCKING R ETARDED GLITCH where when you buy a gun it will charge you for it 2-4 times losing the money you just spend 6 hourss working for. Next complain. ALOT OF THE PEOPLE, mostly the criminals, WHO PLAY THIS GAME ARE F UCKING D IPSHIT A SSHOLES WHO FEEL THE NEED TO OVERCOMPENSATE FOR THER F UCKING MICRO P ENIS'. When your trying to earn chash,the point of the game, you'll have people who decive you, say they will help you and right before you are about to get money they will f ucking r ape you and give you their F UCKING AIDS so that you die and they can steal your money. Next, when your in a van your IMMEDEA TELY F UCKED; having a van basically says 'hey im transporting a s hit load of money come and f ucking get it you c unts'. Now that will trigger all the squeakers around you and they will immedeatly flock to your a sshole trying to wait for you to get out of your van to steal your it, the f ucked up thing is that you need to leave the van to stat making the money, not going to explain ho because it will take too long. Just image the scene from finding nemo with the seagulls, great now replace them with R ETARDED 7 YEAR OLDS. Ok, my final point is that one of the easiest ways to make money is ram raiding which is what i have been talking about mostly, when you have been sweating your a sshole off for the past century to the point where it's dicintegrating your gonna have a nice fat stack of chash available in the back of your van. When/If you get to turn this in with out the f uckboy's around stalking you. Your gonna be on the map if you have above 2.5k dollars. When you've been working THAT F UCKING LONG AND THAT F UCKING HARD AND YOU GET IMMEDEATLY F UCKED IN THE A SS AND YOUR MONEYS BEEN STOLEN YOUR SOUL GETS SUCKED OUT OF YOUR A SS AND YOU WASTE 30 MINUTES OF YOUR LIFE JUST LIKE ME WRITING A RAGE REVIEW ON STEAM BECAUSE ANGER IF THE ONLY THING THAT KEEPS YOU ALIVE. And so concludes my review/essay on why never the play this CANCER GAME.

6632	0	a	saints row, free to play version with all the features that you will never use. you need friends to play this and it's still boring most of the time
8817	0	a	When I heard about this game I was ecstatic. It was much before GTAV got out with online mode. I saw myself as a veteran criminal turning the whole city into a battlezone, making my money from extorsion to laundering and why not trafficking. HOW DISAPOINTED WAS I. People are WAY TOO FAST, getting a sniper shot in the head doesn't kill most of the time, and if you want to be decent, get your credit card out. Also, if you are a criminal, you can mug people on the street, it should get you far enough to buy a kitkat bar and some sweets. You can also try to ram a shop display to grab everything in it, you should end up with MUCH MORE, like, enough cash to buy yourself a new scarf. If you are a cop tho, ho ho ho, you are in for some pain. You get money from missions only. So if nobody is playing criminal on your server, you are bound to be a poor officer without enough cash to start your alcohol addiction untill the rest of your life. Even tho, you got cash, what next? Buy yourself a weapon, keep it 30 days and give it back. BUT YOU CAN CUSTOM YOUR CAR AND IF YOU ARE SKILLED ENOUGH YOU COULD MAKE PINGU ON THE SIDE OF YOUR CAR AND START THE NOOT NOOT PATROL. So yeah, if you want to stay alive, keep sprinting in ALL DIRECTIONS and hope for the dude to not have a VERY GOOD AIM.

1427	1	a	I really like this game, the events are the fun part of it all....sure there are people who are like pay-to-win but that's not the case....better guns dosn't mean better player. The costomization is amazing....this is like GTA with more costomization
1448	1	a	Drive by shootings. High speed driving on freeways and then hitting a ramp and soaring. Robbing shops like a boss. Shooting up Criminals like a boss. I like cars.

6745	0	a	Absolutely terrible balancing, poorly polished, and just not very fun to play. This game had the most potential out of any free to play game on steam, but everything that couldve been was poorly executed. Gunplay is average, weapon balance in this game makes call of duty look like Blacklight retribution. If you have about 60 dollars to drop on this game for better weapons and vehicles, go right ahead and play this game because the best weapons cost about 15 dollars
5525	0	a	stupid game. so mutch bugs
5159	0	a	  Complete Trash
5010	0	a	I can't do much of a review game never truly launched. I use windows 7 professional 64x. Pro free Con wasted about 90 minutes trying to get to play it.
486	1	a	sorry about the scar.
10391	1	a	OK, it seems to me a lot of people have negative things to say about this game. I personally love this game, I cant stop playing. I think what happens a lot of the time is people start playing the game and dont realize just how immense this game is. They get like a whole 0.5% of the game played and dont understand it, and quit out of frustration. This game isnt the prettiest, and it does have its share of bugs. But, I expect games this immersive to have bugs, and I'm more about gameplay and less about graphics. If youre looking for a great MMORPG game this is it. The skill builds actually make sense, not like most games that give you the ability to max out all skills, this game makes you choose a specific build set to your play style. The crafting system is rich and really what i love about the game, Im always striving for better gear.   My advice. If you love crafting, skill building, tedious looting(i did say TEDIOUS) this is a great game. Play it. If you're not willing to atleast put 30-40 hours into the game before you make a decision on it, dont play it. This is a game for people of patience.  ALSO, for a free to play game, its still very possible to advance in the game and play it to the near fullest, unlike a lot of other free to play games.
2580	1	a	Damm good game 51 hours of play 2 characters. This game is pure epicness definatly get it
10247	1	a	I don't recomend this game. I haven't even played it...and that's the problem. It takes forever just to check for updates. When you actually get in the game, there's no cursor or anything. It's hard to push any buttons it displays. I can't even click the freakin PLAY button. If this happens to you, don't even bother. If it doesn't, play away.
633	1	a	I don't know why, but i really recommend this game. Good soundtrack, pretty nice graphics, cool gameplay. Just play it! No matter if these â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s that pay by 'Microtransactions' are rekting ya. Just have fun! &lt;3
9274	0	a	Its free, no game should EVER need to update in game. if your going to download it over steam NEVER EVER EVERRRRRRRR MAKE YOU SIGN UP ON A ALTERNATE WEBSITE AND HAVE TO UPDATE IN GAME. other than that i have not even played the game because of that!
2793	1	a	-Pros Good open world with lots of landmarks and combat-friendly areas Fun car controls &amp; car variety Lots of stuff to do Music player in vehicles is pretty cool Amazing customization of characters and cars  -Cons Pay to win Really bad servers (although they're getting better) Unoptimized, lag spikes (even on great hardware) Takes several minutes to launch for some machines 
5306	0	a	This game would be really nice if it wasnt pay to win i mean why do i have to pay money for an ingame gun 40$?I can buy better stuff with that
7459	0	a	Much of the UI for character creation work sporadically at best. You get dumped in at a spawn point with no idea what to do. My spawn point was/appeared to be a bank. Peopl ran in and started shooting and I couldn't tell who was on what side. Makes a game with two factions difficult when you don't know what side the players are on.
3266	1	a	Very addicting, even if it's a bit repetitive. Admittedly it's hard to progress without premium once you get to a certain point, and a lot of the premium weapons are overpowered, but not to the point where you NEED them to do well. Admittedly, I haven't played in over a year, so this may have changed.
1230	1	a	10/10 from me just wish the licence plate was a bit more readable :) All in all great game you should get.
793	1	a	fun big learning curve
9373	1	a	how do you make a account? 
4567	0	a	I would recommend you don't start playing this game in the first place. It has so many issues that never get resolved. They release the same thing over and over. Unfortunately I made the mistake and started playing it 3 years ago, now I am hooked. It's like an abusive relationship, you get tired of it and leave for a little bit, but end up coming back for more.
2221	1	a	Crashing realy gets me wet, I love this game
6490	0	a	It's a pretty good game, but it's the BIGGEST PAY TO WIN I HAVE EVER PLAYED. For example, it takes a while to unlock the rocket launcher. I've played this game for days and haven't come close to getting the gun that can one-shot cars. People can go straight in with real money, buy a rocket launcher, then run around blowing people up when they are such a low level. It doesn't seem fair that the people playing the game like it should be played are getting crapped on by the people who run in with a wod of cash and buy everything in the game.
6233	0	a	This â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥ makes me want to puke!  I swear this is giving me nightmares...

995	1	a	Yes, i still love this game... even tough i am bored of it, for a few reasons, well first i'm really tired of the same aspect of the game beign, just getting called to a mission and do the objective, and or shoot enf/crims it's fun for a few hours, but noticing that im not the only one noticing that this game get really repatitive, and has pay2win weapons and other such of quipment, other then that, unlocking things is cool, but i wish i could unlock some of the lastest things, and all the new things like clothing items, and much more.... I my self, and are one of the most people that play this game, morally for the cuztomization purpose. Pretty FUN game, if you are new, also can be funner, if you accually play with a friend.
9407	0	a	It says that I played this game for 14 hours... this 14 hours of trying to get it to work, this incluedes making an acount and trying to verify it for ages and also I had to make several accounts attempting and waiting to see if it would work but in the end I gave up!
6467	0	a	Extremely P2W. Over half the things you can buy with money which provides an unfair advantage to those people who have more money than others.
7413	0	a	WTF IS THIS GAME ITS PAY TO WIN HARD TO SHOOT HARD TO DRIVE LIKE OMG THIS GAMWE IS SDHITTY I SUGGEST YOU DONT EVEN MOVE YOUR MOUSE NEAR THE â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ DOWNLOAD BUTTON IF YOU CLICK IT IT WILL DOWNLOAD A CANCER GAME 
3902	0	a	game is pay to win, community is a hybrid of league of legends and middle school edge, gameplay is fun but ruined by these two factors
4862	0	a	its like if grand theft auto had a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ baby.

3337	1	a	Has lots of problems, mostly created by G1. Fun though. Lots of potential.
4570	0	a	I've had more enjoyment being on â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ discord servers than playing this game.
2198	1	a	Not bad! Plenty of customization and quite a bit to keep you busy. Great gameplay with freinds
2073	1	a	Dont let my steam play hours fool you. I've been playing APB off and on again sense Key to the City was a 3 day early access pre-order bonus under RTW (makers of the game) and not a +$90 cash shop bundle. So iv got closer to 500-1000hrs.  This game was great in its early years. This is the game that got me into PC gaming. This is the game i joined my first clan in. Nothing is more fun than a GTA style mmo. I dont even know how to write a review about this game so im just gonna do another Pros and Cons.  Pros:  Gameplay - its just plain fun to play cops and robbers Competitive - people talk trash and tbag. If your a big baby then dont play this game. There are REALLY good players that will seem like they are hacking but most aren't. Ranking - theres Green, bronze, silver and gold that indicates your win to lose ratio. Customization - ITS CRAZY. It no Illustrator but some artists could fool me. Thereâs little more thatâs as satisfying than when you sell a car and you run into the person that bought it in game. Guns - Guns, guns, guns. I love guns. Down bullets go. Into ur torso. mm mm mm. Little guns, big guns, guns that go boom. i lovem all. 1-3 mod slots with each mod having their own pros and cons. Prebuilt guns if you not a high level for slotted ones too. Missions - Theres only a hand full but there's enough variety and locations on the map where they take place that you hardly notice.  TDM - eh, not my thing but people like it. I like to have a mission instead of just running around shooting peopl. Music - you can play music from your PC in game to feel like a badass. I'm not entirely sure how it works now but it used to be if the game didn't know what the song was it would play it for you and play a song of the same genera for others.  Cons: Pay to win (?) - it used to be VERY pay to win. in the last week or so that iv started playing again i havenât noticed this as much. Prices - A single gun can cost $40 to keep it permanently. Luckily thereâs a try it first mode. Renting guns - you donât buy a gun with in game money and keep it. you rent it for 10 days, buy the ammo and rent the gun again if you like it. Its a cash sink to get you to pay for the monthly sub. Im not gonna list the sub as a con because you only need 2-3 months of it to get what you want. Crybabies - SOOO many people cry hacker. People will just sit back and let the timer run out on the mission or straight up rage quit adding another loss to your ratio. In the early days my clan was accused of hacking almost every match. Its hilarious sometimes. Ranking - this is also a con because of the lack of gold ranked people. Almost all servers are rated for silver or bronze players. If youâre a gold ranking going into a silver or bronze rated server then you get penalties in XP and money. This is to keep golds from rolling over the less skilled people but sense thereâs less people playing these days itâs more of a problem for golds. False Promises - Gamersfirst are just a big bunch of liers. They promised racing maps, more mission maps and bla bla bla it was all a lie. Maps became a chunk of a mission map for TDM and racing maps still donât exist. Racing was supposed to be a way to unlock car parts but i guess they just want cash for that.  I love this game and as long as they keep the hackers out and the P2W model down low, ima keep on loven.  P.S. its bested played with a group so find a clan.
3595	1	a	Its nice and fun game to play with friends. But the support is â¥â¥â¥â¥.
1847	1	a	love this game just wnat a pvp server so you can free roam and kill at same time
1197	1	a	It has something the recent Saints Row have, but infact this game is alot better.   Gets out car, car goes kamikaze and kills me, would kamikaze again. 10/10
8165	0	a	I will say this game has the best customization in a game I have ever seen! but as for gameplay goes, driving in this game is horrible it's like every car is on ice being a free game as well has invited a lot of hackers to play and the game is just dead now.  Don't waste your time.
780	1	a	i like the game its awesome
7079	0	a	The game si old and full of cheaters. I don't recommend this game is those days :D.
3221	1	a	this game is realy fun so i will give it a thumbs up the only down sides to this game is the 50 minute time it takes to load and the lag
2139	1	a	pretty snazzy shoot shoot bang bang dead
4992	0	a	Basic rundown of APB mechanics:  Miners (known as 'Criminals' in-game) run out and 'mine' stores for ore, or 'mine' civilian NPCs for ore. Then they load their load of loot into a car - which they pick up GTA style usually - to drive it to the shopkeeper to sell each individual peice.  Police (known as 'Enforcers' in-game) run around attacking miners whenever they manage to lay eyes on a miner when they do any of the above. Police can start a battle against miners and kill them to take all of their loot.   The miner faction is unable to attack police unless police start attacking first. This setup lends the power 100% to police. Police typically [always] just don't start the battle if they don't see a win from it. This usually tends to mean the police will have a severe advantage over the miners if they attack; a group of three or more against a single miner, outrageous weapons comparitibly, or outlevel the miner immensely. Almost always by the time the miner knows they're under attack they're already half dead (or less than a second form being run over) and haven't a chance to make up for the poor head start.   Ironically it feels like they gave the mechanics to the wrong factions. Enforcers are usually the antagonists and Criminals are usually the innocents in this game. It doesn't help that the situation causes most Enforcer players to get very cocky and the Criminal players to get very defensive.  The server is unstable. It crashes constantly; which sucks mostly because it takes about 15 minutes to load the game completely and it can last as little as 10 minutes before another crash.  The community is FULL of confirmed hackers on both sides. If you go into higher ranked areas you'll be tracked through walls and hit with aimbots. Lower level PvP is fun, but don't attempt to play to be the high rank. While there are no doubt some legitimately skilled players there are far more hackers. As far as I can tell hackers don't even get banned for hacking.   Final verdict:  The game is alot of fun. Sadly its mechanics imbalanced and it's full of hackers. The Enforcer faction is also highly antagonistic (albiet due to understandable environmental and psychological circumstances). I'd recommend anyone that still has any desire to play to avoid going Criminal faction. It sounds fun and cool when you hear about it but you can't do anything but be killed and robbed.
7196	0	a	Dreadful. Punkbuster, whom i assume is the equivalent of valve. Doesn't include the full game in the steam download. You actually have to manually patch the game or you get kicked every 2 or 3 minutes in game which takes about a 30 second load screen in and out. The game looks cool but literally one of the worst installs on steam
3326	1	a	Doesnt Support dual screens, so i had to disable a screen to play it, throws you into a game with no information on what you have to do or when or how. all the quests are as followed, go to point Hold the F key. Pick up thing with the F key drive back to start point. get reward. Driving is terrible cars handle like they are on ice every mechanic in the game is clunky and un refined to the point of it being unusable. Quests that use PVP are simply defend point or capture point while killing people that respawn over and over for 10 minutes. when u die ull respawn about a half minute walk away from the action. youll die in 2 hits, they will die in about 2 Clips. no exceptions. camera sways from side to side like your drunk in gta4 with roman. everything about this game is complete â¥â¥â¥â¥. a person i know just said that you have to get used to it, but id rather not lower my standerds of play. The only people that play this are the sad people that cant justify paying for it before it was f2p
8807	0	a	This game has people that spend money on items that are either perm or temp. Before their were any hackers but now we got aim hackers and speed hackers everywhere and the anti cheat is just plain garbage. If you dont spend real life money on this game you will not get anywhere unless you get boosted. I get 1 shot by a pistol when my shotgun cant even kill them close range which is what it is meant for. I wouldnt recommend this game if you dont wanna waste money. But if you do then go ahead.
4586	0	a	DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME IN DOWNLOADING THIS GAME IT IS FULL OF HACKERS AND THE DEVS DON'T CARE!!!!  It has so much potential to be a great game, but unless you're hacking, don't waste your time!! You can purchase the hacks online, those are the ones that the Devs don't do anything about, do not download a free hack or it will be picked up!! Why am I telling which hacks work? Because I want this game to go down and be destroyed along with all the hacker â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and useless devs. If you make a game, get rid of hackers or land up being a â¥â¥â¥â¥ title that is overrun by a small population of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s and loses out on a possibly very supportive fan base.
322	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME IT IS SO FAUHKOING AWESOME! TRY IT! LOVE IT!
10	1	a	Ahh an honest review?Huh,that can be kinda hard but lets see: 1.Amazing Customization Features 2.Fast paced gameplay(unless you are camping with a sniper like a total idiot) 3.EXTREMELY long-like to unlock everything in a game is a gamer's worst nightmare,but here...well.. you can have a solid 1000 hours and still don't have every unlockable item for your faction,not even gonna talk about maxing both factions. 4.EXPLOSIONS 5.Gamersfirst(the company that made the game)recently changed their office from England to the USA and they are planning to recruit a lot more people and 2017 we are expecting a new engine from Tiggs.Here is a video:         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  APB Reloaded engine upgrade render test (in-game capture)&nbsp;
7549	0	a	Ive downloaded this on my laptop, 2 of my other desktops. Specs are beyond what is needed and it is up to date. The game doesnt run...
7986	0	a	The handling and mechanics are clunky, I gave it a try because APB made some noise when it was announced back in the day, now I understand why this version is free. Though there's a lot of interesting initiatives (like a software that lets you compose tunes... in the game), all in all it feels slow and awkward. Don't waste your time on that game.
3298	1	a	i would recomend it for fast computers but not for slow ones or you will have a verycrappy time
1948	1	a	A Good GTA Clone
4182	0	a	I just want to say this game is perfect example have Pay To Win in Free to Play can make game worst..... Game is soooo good for about 10hrs but after that you can see and get in lobby guys what have a lot of payed stuff and that is really bad becouse it gives them a lot of boost and advantage.. You can see how game is set around Pay To Win becouse every time you start game it shows you shop with stuff for reall money... Its really good game but only if you buy in game items for reall money.... Gamersfirst Fix this ....
7158	0	a	Almost worse than LoL
10370	1	a	Very fast pace :3

5976	0	a	  I've played this game hundreds of hours off Steam, and the only valid reason this would still be a playable game is for the nostalgia. Really, it used to be a great game with an intresting concept, BUT NAH! Let's make it pay-to-win! I wouldn't waste more time on this than I already have.  Matchmaking: You're bronze rating? Cool, we're gonna match you with gold players at lvl 255, sure. And they're not even gold players themselves, they're just some rich kiddos with aimbot.  Updates: Well, tons of updates. Every week a new weapon. Which you have to pay for like 15$ or buy it on the in-game market for 2 million game cash., which you can grind in about 3 months. Without premium, that is. Buy premium and it's in 1.5 months. Boom.  Physics: If San Paro was a real place, it wouldn't really be in our universe. Strange things happen, I tell ya. The vehicle physics are little said funny. There's just so many things you can do with 2 cars, and then there's the Vegas 4x4. It used to be a premium-only car, but then they added a refferal system so if you play with friends you get points, and if you gather enough you can get it for free. That thing is so overpowered, you can literally land on rooftops with it, also add a Nitro 3 mod just for the fun of it :D The character physics can be frustrating sometimes, and the interactive objects like doors and ladders aren't of any good. Hey, this game has something good, at least!  Customization: This is where the real pro of the game is at. They say. But in reality, you can add, umm, a few decals that you can make yourself by using only boring shapes and stuff, and yeah. BUT HEY, BUY PREMIUM AND YOU CAN HAVE UP TO 100 DECALS ON YOUR CAR! Isn't that just great! Well no, it isn't if you don't wanna spend money on this.  Overall, this game is fun for some weeks to mess around with a friend, but otherwise don't waste your time.  AND THE TROLLS, MAN! SO MANY TEAMKILLERS AND NOOBS!
6972	0	a	Rather play GTA online. At least GTA online not PAY to WIN.
9209	1	a	its a nice game keep up the good work :)
1488	1	a	I recommend that you do not play this game.
5793	0	a	This f*cking game, it almost gave me an aneurism. It is so terrible, as my friend Jack mentioned you either fork out $30 for a gun that isn't very good, or grind for weeks for a sh*tty cosmetic item such as shoes. The optimization is awful, the community is a bunch of 12 year olds, cars handle like there's no gravity, and the interface doesen't even work and/or is confusing as sh*t. Hackers everywhere and glitchers constantly killing you. Even with the poor anticheat if there even is one. This game is truly, one of the absolute WORST programs I have ever had on my hard drive. And who the hell sells a $100 DLC that has very little to offer??? Dafuq?  1/10.
2683	1	a	This game man. I played it in its original form before it shutdown. I still have never played a game that beats this in character customization. The game itself is fun. More enjoyable with friends. It just feels really cool to be driving around with your buddies and having them hanging out the windows with guns blazing.  Now that the game is free, it is totally worth checking out.
8313	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ game, way 2 laggy, the idea is great, but the game itself is terrible
3068	1	a	its sort of fun
1983	1	a	I thought it was fun. Not sure why so many negative reviews
3968	0	a	Be prepared to spend $500 on in game items and still need to use an aimbot if you want to have fun
2930	1	a	APB Reloaded is free to play, free roam game.  (i have played roughly 8 hours, so this one may be lacking)  To begin, this game is deffinatly a game you should try, it's a fantastic alternatative to the famous 'Saints Row' or GTA that everyone seems to love.   The game has 2 factions that you choose at the begining of the game  Criminal or Enforcer.  These 2 factions fight eachother to either destroy the city or rebuild and defend it.  The free roam aspect is done well, gameplay is smooth and there's always somthing to do. Gunplay is a bit laggy but manageable   Like all F2P games, there is a Pay sectrion where you use real money to get exclusive items, this may potientally abe a game breaker, as alot of the items are pretty overpowered.   There are also a heap of customisation options avalible to make your character look uniqe.    APB is a fun game with stuff to do in it, Deffinatly give it a try. 
9416	0	a	This game completely sucks, I didnt like anything about it, and its missing sound....... Not recommend
1140	1	a	If you're looking for fun, I guess this is a good substitute.
1828	1	a	play this game
6406	0	a	Meh...just wait for GTA Online.
2558	1	a	Very fun to play with friends or without friends. Either way, it's solid. Being a good change to other MMOs. The game looks amazing and even with minium settings. 8/10 stars.
9539	0	a	Crap game, don't bother...
2878	1	a	i would recommend this game because it makes my penus large
1487	1	a	I mean its good , but i dont like controls
5697	0	a	its piece of crap on a stick
7084	0	a	APB: Oh that's a nice song you've spent several hours creating. Me: ~Scrambles to hit save~ APB: It's be a shame if... Me: ~Starts crying~ APB: I CRASHED FOR NO REASON ~crashes~
181	1	a	Nice game
5814	0	a	Meh its just meh, its not good or bad just... meh. Its free so you can give it a try, i played 20h on â¥â¥â¥ or smth like that. There are beter f2p games on steam like team fortress 2 or warframe.
9414	0	a	Wasted 30 minutes of my life playing this game. Bad sound effects bad controls bad graphics bad gameplay.
2778	1	a	 Easy to learn, a lifetime to master
8771	0	a	I was banned for literally no reason.
4703	0	a	I downloaded this because the picture reminded me of Jet Grind Radio. The game didn't so I uninstalled it.
5323	0	a	Sadly I cant recomend this abysmal game to anyone, the screenshots make it look cool, REALLY COOL! but it fails on the worst design choices. The Driving is worse then Alone in the Dark (2008) im not kidding, and the Shooting is so hard to get a good shot, all this due to the DAMN CONTROLS BEING MORE UNRESPONSIVE THEN SHAQ FU ON THE SNES!   DONT BUY THIS SH**TY EXCUSE FOR A GAME, PLEASE DONT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE AS I DID!
8522	0	a	On the store page it says free to play. This is the worst free to play game that i have ever played you cant experience everithing without using money there are some game that you need to grind in but this game tops all of them.i havent played much but if i play a game and i get frustrated from it in 1 hour then its a bad game in my opinnion,but give it a try you might like it.
6429	0	a	worst game ever i played so far,just got in,got banned,by being new,10/10 would pick up a pistol and shoot Reloaded,took more than 40 mins to download,what was very boring,then i could play 20 minutes (its a disgrace to steam,its the WORST game i've ever played,yes,even out of the bought and free games)
3590	1	a	I remember playing this game very often and having so much fun with it. It was the first of its kind that I had seen, and was just so addicting. Not exactly a P2W game, but all their paid items do get annoying. Another thing was the unforgettably bad community. Honestly, it's not the worst I've ever seen but it was still pretty bad. Lots of cheaters and hackers, too.   Other than that, the game can be very enjoyable. It becomes so much more fun once you find a friend to play with. The gameplay itself isn't the worst I've seen, and the customization is just awesome. Now that I think about it, you can basically customize every single aspect of your character (including vehicles) in great depth.  The game is fun but does have its flaws, but it's free, so what do you have to lose? Download the game, try it out, uninstall if you don't like it.
6169	0	a	1 word. No its 3 words i think  PAY TO WIN
6230	0	a	Bad game. Long Loading times.GTA clone
8448	0	a	Dont Get me wrong the Game is funn but theres some game changing bugs such as if someone is close enough to the wall the can shoot you through it killing you. another thing theres only one server For NA(North America) and theres way to admins that abuse i was kicked about 12 times in the middle of gameplay i enjoyed playing for a bit but the admins really didnt allow me to play its worth downloading if you Are able to play without getting kicked. good luck dont download this game if you dont have the patients
2452	1	a	it is hoorrrible trash.it keeps saying i need the D3D9 device or something.and, i cant even play on ONE server because it says i need some device or whatever. so my rating is negative 1 out of ten.
9689	0	a	Take Fallout, WoW &amp; STALKER and throw them in the trash. The result is this game.
171	1	a	Very gud
7905	0	a	Excuse my last one but now, I hate this now... It used to be great fun. Bought a Shotgun, a crappy auto shotgun. Won a few scraps. Earned enough money to bid money for a well created Cerberus Jacket. Got a Robo-Cop kill theme. Watched a few people role-play. Had fun in general.  But now, now it's all gone down in a spiral. I used loved to play this game, the customisation, the role-playing from time to time. In truth, I really, really, really dislike (absolutely hate) this game. But the reason why I play it? I play it in hopes that it will be back the way it used to be.
8089	0	a	This game is so confusing and never got to kill any crooks or cops because of some reason and all of the stuff is pay to get
3522	1	a	TLDR: Great game, lots of customizations enjoy it  Let me start by saying, my steam hours do not reflect my acutal playtime, I played many more times before this came out on steam.  This game is great with it's ups and downs, as most free to play are but overall, it's a very good game.  Let's start with some of the bad things so you can end off on a good note. It's hard playing at the beginning because you can get vehicles stolen that you are using to make your money (vans usually), the combat might seem pay to win because you are up against high level or high threat players with much better when you are low level/low threat due to glitchy matchmaking however this can be avoided in premade teams and you can always win against better guns even though it might seem hard, using even the start gun on a new character I can take on quite a few people. There are quite a few glitches and bugs but most free to play games have these and you get used to it pretty fast.  There are quite a few good things I could say but the one thing that really sticks out in everyway is the customization. Customization. Customization. You can customize every aspect of this. Your character, car, weapon and everything else is completely customizeable. Don't like your character look? Head on down to the social district and buy items made by other players or make your own. Hell I ran into iron man playing 'I am Iron Man' and during any of the parts there weren't any lyrics he would scream 'I AM IRONMAN!' The community is great while at the same time very toxic depending on who it is. You can also customize your car. Pick your type of car, choose a color and make graphics or buy graphics to put onto your car and enjoy. One of my favorite points of customization for this game is how you can upload your own songs and play them while ingame in your car and people outside your car who have not downloaded the song onto their computer can hear your car. Customization is one of the biggest parts of this game which make it appealing but overall the game is fun to play in most ways where you can enjoy yourself and have fun.  TLDR: Great game, lots of customizations enjoy it
10595	0	a	I'm kinda new so how do I close this game?
10723	1	a	Brilliant....Utterly Brilliant
2806	1	a	Imagine GTA where you should buy everything for REAL money.
8317	0	a	While they are not bad, this game's graphics require more hardware power than games that look twice as good(for example FarCry3) I also found that controlling the car was quite difficult with the keyboard making the game (to me at least) nearly unplayable.
5472	0	a	DO NOT get this game. It is terrible!! The driving is off, the shooting is off, and the controls are terrible! It is no wonder the company that made this went under!
4844	0	a	I love APB, but the game managers doesn't even care about their customers.
3123	1	a	Still one of my Favorite games to play, it's F2P and has lots of action and fun  Wacky physics, great gun play  Smart strategy and skill is key to become a gold level player  New players can easily dominate vets if you have the skill and ability to stay calm and play smart  APB:R atleast try it!
4959	0	a	A lot of people say this is a pay to win game.. It's not.. It's a pay to be slightly better than you were before but still getting destroyed...  1 SMG=27$? That's ridicoulous...  This game is UN-COMPLETABLE if you don't spend money.. Like.. a LOT of money...
6027	0	a	tried it out for a couple of minutes. didnt really like it.
6325	0	a	its a really bad take on gta filled with asians
4737	0	a	I bought this game when it was just APB with Realtime Worlds.  It was frustrating then but enough people played to make it mostly enjoyable. I decided to give it another go and I just can't even get a foothold.  It's an uphill battle the whole way. Max rank, gold threat opposition every single game. Me and the sad team the matchmaking system would scrounge up for me would get trounced every game without fail.  You either have to buy some better gear (which I get the sense they count on), find a team that's good or slog through the grind until you can compete.  Long story short, this game is NOT beginner friendly.  I also need to add that the 'microtransaction' system is nothing close to micro. In fact, to purchase a gun it costs $20 upwards. That's just a single gun. They've taken the notion of a free to play system and add ons that are cheap and gone crazy.  They incentivise it at every turn as well. It's an impossible grind to obtain items unless you buy them. In many games you almost have to have the purchased weapons in order to compete when the other team is packing them. I'm sure most people would rather just buy a game outright and have everything the game has to offer, or at the very least not pay a price for additional content that rivals what a normal game's price would be to begin with.  It's a shameful, obvious cash grab. I would buy something if the prices weren't so outrageous. This system has strangled and alienated the community at a steady rate. I'd be surprised if within 2 years this game is still alive as a result.  ...Not to imply that the current community population could be considered 'alive.'

4782	0	a	Game should be called 'Fashion Show With Guns'. Everything in this game â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sucks â¥â¥â¥ except customization.  It used to be fun, but now it could get shut down and I wouldn't even notice or care.  I hope G1 goes super bankrupt, because regular bankrupt is too good for them.

9761	0	a	This game is one of the worst game i ever play
4819	0	a	This is a great game to play when you feel like putting a gun to your head and pulling the trigger. Very nice. :^ )
6805	0	a	Are you ready to get blown to bits by people with rocket launchersa and never do anything productive? Then this is the game for you!
10337	1	a	Yeah its good, Not a waist of time. Bacically its your opinon on games
2069	1	a	This game is amazing. Any game I can build a Mystery Machine and rob stores with it, I am for it.
8324	0	a	.
4244	0	a	Well, as you can see i have played this for nearly 24 hours. Yet, i have no idea what is this game about, what is the objective of this game.
961	1	a	Well seeing as how this game's complicated to a fault, ONLY has an awkward 'over the shoulder' camera view that I can't stand, the freeroam is day or night always full of spawn campers &amp; high level cops who either kill you or bust you every 5 secs... (WHY? because the X-box 360 won't map to the stick for stuff like turn left or right in driving mode in your car, amoung other control mapping issues on foot ect. it's not even entirely clear about if the zones [beside the social 1 where nobody shoots you &amp; you can edit your char ect.] are or are not PVP on all the time, who wants to die 10,000 times while struggling to grind a brand new char in areasd full of level capped toons with an inferiority complex... crimecraft was more fun then this @ lower levels. do_Ob
6816	0	a	The loading screen is better than the game... It's another ''free to play'' game. But there are of course all of those people who really like to pay for this stupid game. I don't even think if I should really call it a game. It is like modern art... You pay a lot of money, but it is still nothing.
5297	0	a	This game is terible, the graphics are not good and laggy and just plain terible. Do not get this game, its worse than farmville and its nothing like GTA
10452	0	a	It's an ok game but it gets boring and repetitive quite quickly :/
1349	1	a	APB Reloaded Is A Game Full Of Violence And Crime. Which Means Good, It's Like Playing Grand Theft Auto 5 But More Violence And The Guns Are Really Cool. You Can Edit Cars And Costumize Your Character..... I Give This Game A Thumbs Up! After Playing It, It's Really Good, A Lot Of Users Killing Each Others. Enforces Vs. Criminals. Two Standards! The Standard Of Crime And The Standard Of Justice.  I Really, Really Like This Game! I Recommend This Game For You Guys, So Many Guns And ACTION!
9735	0	a	It sucks.
8308	0	a	I have uninstalled and reinstalled this game 3 times, I am not very good at FPS but the it seems like the only people who play this game have perfect 100% accuracy and they can tell when I am coming around corners its amazing and frustrating. I reccomend not even playing this game as you will have fun up until you hit those types of players that just absolutely know where you are and can kill you in seconds with hard shots, crazy game super fun but i dont believe in the anti cheat system of this game.
9010	1	a	To tell you all how good this game just know I forgot I even played it until I went to the store page. 10/10.
5959	0	a	Just don't play this game.
2289	1	a	really fun with team mates :)
7998	0	a	it's quite fun but...   its kinda pay to win~
8834	0	a	They have a good idea but poor design its a little laggy and it gives trouble when trying to open up i think if it gets more work done to it it could be great but as is gonna give it a 3/10
5123	0	a	It's meh. Really cool concept, good gameplay (if it works well, which it didn't on my old computer, and its performance still has some problems on my university wifi [not the game's fault, just a note]), but my only complaint is that it's Pay-to-Win,   Really sad that they killed such a cool game with such a horrible practice.  If you don't mind dumping money into a game to make it playable (or you don't mind making yourself so OP that the game is too easy [I know lots of you MMO players out there already do it]), then you'll enjoy this TPS, faction-based-warfare MMO.   Otherwise: avoid.
2492	1	a	Cool game if you are playing with friends, but it has a lot of downfalls. Graphics, AI problems, Fps drops and hackers...
3823	0	a	All I know is after 44 hours (some more if you include the hours I palyed before I played on steam) I was about ready to flip my desk. I had a bigger reveiw earlier, but apparently it was inaccurate. If you are good at this game, good for you. The newbs hate you, and you enjoy your time on the game. Me? This game is only fun for customization. Nothing else, considering I can land one bullet on some veteran players.  BUT I CAN'T STOP â¥â¥â¥â¥ING PLAYING!
10831	1	a	I guess it's pretty addicting.
1796	1	a	I just came here to read the comments :o ***
2471	1	a	if you dont care about hacker and if you dont rage at this game you are not human
8633	0	a	I downloaded the game when me and my friend wanted to play a game with some entertainment value. Kinda hard to find that when everyone is teleporting right next to you while you are shooting at them from across the street.  This is what I get for trying â¥â¥â¥â¥ games again...
8762	0	a	50% trying to make the game launch, 50% loading screen...Only good part was the uninstalling.
491	1	a	G1 finally banning cheaters. Best game ever.
4716	0	a	Does't work so I can't recommend it.
9814	1	a	You can ride cars and grind mobs - 12/10 best f2p mmo.
10916	1	a	I absoloutley love games like this one try it and please tell me if you know about anything else like it
1369	1	a	better than GTA online 6/10.
902	1	a	I am making this city safe from Crime!   By shooting people with assault rifles &amp; shotguns running over civilians and standing in a circle.  I'M MAKING A DIFFRENCE
10190	1	a	this is and outstanding game to play its like fallout and dayz mixed together you can get vehicals to drive horses to ride go on adventures kill monsters other people on the server get guns such as ak-47s but in the game they are diffrent names rifles shot guns pilstols and alot more
6825	0	a	For now im going for not recommended because the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game forces you to create a profile on another site WHERE !!! You cant even â¥â¥â¥â¥ing register !!!!!! So i havent even got to the stupid game :((((
5091	0	a	This game sucks. I love this game. I hate this game. This game should have won game of the decade. thats how i feel when i play APB: Reloaded. It is absaloutly NOT new user friendly, but, its fun to just screw around, not even doing the missions. thats what i do. even though there are constant lag spikes, and the driving is really clunky, i love to screw around. some may also say this a a p2w, its is, then it isnt, its not like its all: BUY STUFF 2 WIN DIS MISSION UNLESS U WANT TO DIE 400000000000000 TIMES!!! its more like: you can buy this is u want, but you dont have to if you dont want to. i like that aspect. it also reminds me HEAVILY of the GTA series. overall, with some fixes, it could be a great game. 
10698	1	a	So it goes like this:  Once upon a time, there was a contest for something or other, and so some people started making a game for said contest. They won, of course, and so emerged from the depths of a volcano in some land somewhere...  Realm of the...  ...MAD GOD.  A good game, yes, indeed. No pay to win, no lag... When one day, a terrible thing happened to the realm! It was purchased by none other than...  JACK M. CRAZYFISH! er i mean  KABAM!  No you imbiscle, not like the comic book guy getting punched, the game company. Stupid idiot.  Lag, pay to win, and much, much, worse. A slight delay in spells, just enough to mess up the timing. Harder enemies, more (hard) events, more ways to die.  Soon it became filled with trade bots, TRADE BOTS EVERYWHERE! (gasp)  But what made it pay to win? Well, I lied. It's not pay to WIN. It's pay to save you MULTIPLE HOURS. I have obtained items such as T5 Cloak of Endless Twilight (one of the best cloaks currently in-game) The T10 Staff of some-fancy-word-I-can't-remember, and the T11 Robe of the ditto-from-the-staff-before.  Anyone complaining that this game is P2W is wrong, wrong, and WRONG. It's very fun if you have a couple friends to go adventuring with, but I do not recommend for kids under age thre- I mean, people that have no friends.  6/10
1783	1	a	This game is a real challenge if you play alone, there is alot of players that are really good. Few months ago there was a raid to kick out all the hackers when they get reported and that made the game playable again. Irocammand tha game if you have few friends to play with you in a 3 or 4 player squad if you start. There is NO limits in customization of your clothes to your cars, so your oponnents will reconnize you if your start to be a threat :P. I hope this was helpful, good game!
9233	1	a	Dead game(  http://steamcharts.com/app/113420#48h  
1139	1	a	I think that APB Reloaded is a good game and i think you should get it and make an account.
2527	1	a	nice game but driving sucks big time!
8911	0	a	This game just sucks â¥â¥â¥. Devs aren't going to fix anything. Ai can heal them self to full health instantly if they want, They can jump to roofs and run trough walls and hit you from 100m distance with a melee weapon. This game is not worth your time, don't even try it.
1095	1	a	Its pretty much a free version of GTA V if your too poor to afford GTA V  My first day.. Walk out of the Station...see three pimped out Super cars drag racing down the street...one hits a car, flips over, and exploads... Me: I think I'm gona like this game!  Second Day... Walk out of the Station...See a pimped out van driving down the streets with 2 guys hanging out the sides unloading their weapons into whoever is chaseing them...Whos chasing them? two pimped out Super cars with sirens blaring...one hit a car, flips over and explodes... Me: Yep...I'm definitly gona like this game...
10746	1	a	Realm of the Mad god, The hub world for the latest game! 'Who can ninja the best stuff!' It's addicting as hell!!!
9629	1	a	RealChris said it all. Reminds me of a kinda 'Fallout Online' Crafting system. Auction system. Mounts. It's probably the best MMORPG i've ever gotten into so far. I'm still pretty new, but so far, this game is worth your time trying. Happy Scavenging!
6158	0	a	You can put swastikas on your car and block spawns with a garbage truck but the combat system sucks â¥â¥â¥ and there's â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ of premium. 2/5
3730	1	a	Pretty steep learning curve. Pretty salty community. The costimization options a wicked!
4482	0	a	This game had me REALLY exited to play, and looks cool and everything, i'd imagine it would be super fun if you could get past the stupid and very frustrating Punkbuster issues, i've spent about 10 hours trying every solution in the book and i either get 'no packet flow' message or 'failed to initalize pnkbustrb.exe' this game would be so much better if it didn't have a ****** up and lazily put together Cheat program, if i could scream at the coders of punkbuster i would
9436	0	a	This game crashed every time I ran it and still had bugs and when I got past the crash part it crashed aagin.... Horrible game.
3970	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Pay to win game. Waste of time.
461	1	a	This game is a difficult game to review. It's a very fun game to play, but it really does feel like a Pay 2 win type of affair. I have not spent money on the game so I should probably be on the other side of the fun fence, but not really. I hear constant stories about hackers but they are a rare case in my experience (Do not hold my experience as a standard, just a point of view). The criminals and enforcers differ in cosmetics only (except that enforcers have stun equipment which does feel incredibly cheap at times). Would I recommend this game? Barely. If anything I listed above sounds like a deterent for you then heed this game. But for me, it's free 2 play so there really isnt anything to lose.
8529	0	a	I dont like this game
4407	0	a	It's only gimmick is customization, it's completely biased towards the enforcer faction, everyone is a self-absorbed prick, and I am suffering chronic dehydration from how â¥â¥â¥â¥ing salty everyone is.  Even with the customization, every male character looks like an angsty edgy â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, and every female character looks like a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥toy bimbo.  Surprisingly not pay-to-win, but everything in the armas market is overpriced to hell and back.  Most of the criminals are whiny 12 year olds who try to be edgy gangsters, and most of the enforcers are 30+ year old neckbeard manchildren who get in heated arguments with said edgy 12 year olds.  And the GMs do hardly anything at all.
7744	0	a	i DO NOT reccomend this game to anyone because the sandbox qualitys are terrible i thought this was gonna be a gta BOOTLEG. The game is okay when you take out trolls,OP guns,paying real money,etc
1235	1	a	I think they should implement motorcycles.  - God Bless
4197	0	a	just got it finished downloading then needed to update and takes forever and it stops and dosent save my download%. 
5769	0	a	Driving is sh*t, matching ising balanced, you have new players matched with players with full mods that its just a one sided fight
6384	0	a	Well APB reloaded is a fun game in customizing but the gameplay is utter â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, this is because the game is way too crowded with hackers and pay to win â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s who spend $250 on virtual items wich you only keep for 3 days.  So no, I do NOT recommend this game to anyone! Avoid at all costs!
9923	1	a	Tl;Dr: Only just started playing (13hrs), but I'm already impressed. Imagine a mashup of: Star Wars Galaxies, EvE, Fallout, Mad Max, Revolution and Firefly and you're somewhere in the right place.  -----------------------------  I used to play Star Wars Galaxies, right from Beta until just before it closed and I've often looked for a game to fill the open world sandbox void that left behind. Fallen Earth really comes very close that that (actually it's better than SWG in almost every possible way - add houses and the ability to freely decorate and some equivalent of Space Ship combat and you've got a winner!).  The crafting system has good depth and is a heavily supported part of the game (lots to make, player auctions and pretty much every item is craftable). It's a true open world and seems to have an active community. I'm enjoying the combat system which is pretty much a FPS/3rd person style with the addition of having hotkey special actions.   The skill system is good, very open and it seems to be totally classless, you just level up the skills you want to use and can mix and match as much as you like (It reminds me of EvE in this respect). Most actions seem to earn you xp, so pretty much everything you do helps you level up, but I've not felt pressured into levelling at all.  The screenshots are a lie, the game doesn't look like that at all - or rather, you never see the game like that. I suggest watching some gameplay videos on Youtube to get a good idea what the game looks and plays like.  It 'feels' a lot like Skyrim/Fallout to me.  The missions/quests are actually really well done. They feel much more dynamic than those in most MMO's. There's nothing mind-blowing about them, but they are about as good as traditional fetch/kill/craft quests can get.  Haven't tried PVP at all, so far it seems to be either non-existant or a very tiny part of the game (at least in the area I'm currently in).   There are also dynamic events in the world, they appear to be little theme-park style things. I don't know how limited time they really are but they give the impression that they come and go, which is pretty cool.  Definitely one of the best MMO's I've played - nothing truly ground-breaking, but everything it does it does very well. I anticipate many hours of good fun with this game. The Free2play system isn't abused, mostly it's just timer buffs, a few extra crating/backpack slots and vanity items. I've not paid for anything yet and I've not felt at all like I'm being forced to pay if I want to get anywhere in the game, though because I haven't been forced to I'm very much inclined to look into the subscription to see what's on offer.
8935	1	a	I'm new to this game that's why I can't tell you much about this yet. This game, as the others says, is a post-apocalyptic MMORPG. I love this game even though there are small number of players. Yes, there are still players playing this game that's why it is not yet 'DEAD'. If you have a problem in-game, just ask in the chatbox and many will respond to you. They will help you a lot. There are also many quests (main or side quests). It is not that easy to level up but it is fun killing and tracking monsters. You can craft, ride horses/vehicles and so on. As of now, that's the only thing I can say. I recommend this game. I'm not telling you to expect that it is a good game, but for me it is awesome. It's still best if you review it yourself. Have a nice day!
9105	0	a	Terribly dissapointed with the gameplay and graphics after many hours of downloading it was a bitter pill to swallow. This game is not for me.
7974	0	a	Every time I run it it loads for about a hour, then crashes. Tried it multiple times, to no avail. Get the game, just to see if your system will run it.
1748	1	a	Great F2P   
2074	1	a	Simply put one of the best free to play games ever.
6386	0	a	Worst GTAV-PayToWin-Copy ever made.  1. Joined. 2. Made a character that took about 15 minutes to make and spawned. 3. Missions... wait, where do i get them... 4. Ah ok, completes tutorial and some other â¥â¥â¥â¥. 5. Loses and wins sometimes, gets lvl3. 6. Can't find a shop. 7. Plays with a random team. 8. Fails. 9. Gets a new car that is totally civilian while i am a cop. Also gets a modification that automatically gets set on the old car. 10. Can't de-equip the modification to set it on the new car. 11. Can only find the 'pay with real money' shop but can't find the shop where i pay with in-game money. 12. Can't find the customization place. (the place where you're supposed to make an own logo/spray/clothes/cars) 13. Gets lags while i got about two times better specs than recommended. 14. Quits and tells myself 'what told me to try this?'. Oh right, it was supposed to be a fun openworld-copsandrobbers-shooting-thirdperson-robbing-patrolling-racing game.  + Great costumization. + Open-world. + Many weapons. + A good-looking loading screen.  - Can't access customization. - Can't really call this open-world because the world is complete â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥T. - To get a new weapon, you need to pay with real money. - If you want to buy a new weapon with in-game cash, it will be with a limited time. - Forever-loading loading-screen. - Completely NOT beginner-friendly. - A few minutes-startup. - Download to play, pay to win, don't pay to lose, lose to uninstall. - Only lvl50 players with shotgun that have 500 metres range. (this is total â¥â¥â¥â¥, a shotgun that shoots at this range!?) - You will regret downloading this. - It's total â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t, you won't like it. - After reading some posts, i understand that this game was 1000-billions-millions-thousands-houndreds-100 better before full release. - If you want to play something like GTA for free... just download GTAV cracked instead of this â¥â¥â¥â¥, i promise it will be better to download 30-50GB and wait in forever than download this... how did i call it? Oh right, total â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t.  [0.0000000P00P/10 Would try to forget about it instead of uninstalling it again.]
9878	1	a	fun for anyone wanting to have fun killing things
2867	1	a	good game with vehicles,thiefs,cops,and arsenal but some weapons are with real money so if u realy wana be good game is pay to win
4414	0	a	I played the Beta and even bought it when it was initially released and I loved the game and it was a huge disappointment when the company went under. I was obviously ecstatic when I heard the game had been picked up and re-released but I hadn't really played until recently. Now it's just crap. A clear case of pay-to-win. I've seen cash users shot in the head multiple times with a burst fire rifle and survive, taken direct grenades and survive, seen their cars getting loaded up with Alig and grenade fire and survive. Then on the flip side I've seen just one of their grenades take out a vehicle, kill someone by just being near the blast and destroying people from long range with an uzi type weapon.   I'm not totally sure what happened to this game but it has no real balance from what I witnessed and have been hearing. I am also aware of a lot of promises that players were given for new content and then not fulfilled. Kind of seems like this game is just here to suck in peoples cash dumb enough to pay at this point. Oh, What could have been :/ R.I.P APB 
5938	0	a	Every time I play this game, I feel a tickle in my taint. So I guess this game is comparable to gonorrhea.
10618	1	a	An interesting and simple game. ROTMG is a great 2D MMORPG in which you fight monsters, level up and find loot! The gameplay is simple and easy to learn but very addictive. It has different stategies and approaches such as tanking, evasion, supporting etc. There are many different classes to choose from and you can unlock more as you master the others!  A great free and addictive game, and only a few MBs, worth a download!  9/10
6109	0	a	worst â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game on the internet opened a door i died 10/10 would not play it again
851	1	a	I personally think this was one of the best games ever put onto the market. Yes there was major glitches, cheating problems, and bugged missions in the end but it was still an amazing game. The game kind of put you into the life of a person, being criminal or enforcer, that you got to control and live out their life. The customization was almost perfect, there were glitches in editors, glitches in applying decals, etc, but nothing that couldn't have been fixed with a few new patches. I think the reason why people did not really get into this game is the fact they didn't play with regular groups of people whilst talking to them in TeamSpeak or Ventrillo. To me when I played this with my group of friends it just felt like we were a real gang of criminals, it was just an amazing feeling and you could really get close to the people you were playing with and it almost felt as if you were really with them. I just think this game had MASSIVE potential and if it had the right funding it could have been probably one of the biggest games in history. People like Savino, JusticeMortice, and other hackers just ruined the community. Nobody liked them and they just acted like total â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ bags and ruined the game with their aimbots. I think if the game had more time to fix all the bugs and fix their anti cheat system it could have been the most amazing game. I mean even as it was I would play around 5 hours a day at least. Thats a lot for a person like me, before this game id maybe play a game once a week for about an hour? I think even with repetitive missions this was one of the most entertaining games ever. I truly will miss this game, and I am sad to never have seen it grow into the game it could have been with some more time and funding. It makes me sad to see this one go. Also all the people who based their review off the first week of gameplay, they fixed pretty much everything with the driving that nobody liked, and just everything that was wrong in the beginning with GAMEPLAY was fixed. Not weapons and that stuff but everything else was fixed and running perfect. Especially the drifting in cars, most amazing drifting I have ever seen in a game. R.I.P APB
9962	1	a	This game has very good gameplay mechanics and does a very well job in defining a post-apocalyptic feel :)) definitely recommend this game.
9594	1	a	10/10
6694	0	a	So the game is getting some serious age right now. Decided to take the game for a spin today, to check if network issues has been fixed. Again!  Took my car for a drive, going to check if I could get to the closest gas station without crashing.  Another player appeared in front of me, driving. None of us didn't even bother to touch the steering wheel, but went flat out crossing our fingers in a head to head collision. This is how bad the lag is.  Unplayable.
10597	1	a	It's a fun game , it's permadeath , but you have a vault where you can put stuff for your characters if you die. Only one chest if you're F2P like me. The game itself is hard and requires some getting used to. Dying is normal in the game, every character dies eventually, even if you have the best armors and weapons and you're maxed and have a legendary pet. So buckle up for this 2d bullet-hell farmfest , where you farm for gear and potions, which you will lose eventually.
8124	0	a	-10/10
6067	0	a	It's hard to really express how bad this is. Let's create a scenario: You just got in the game. You get a basic rifle and pistol. The game does little to tell you what to do and where to go. Instantly, other players murder you, because you're on a mission and all of APB is PVP. You finally figure out what to do.  Know what you find? You find the most boring weapon physics ever created. You find that elite items make all the difference between win and lose. You find a player base of suburban kids that love 'gang banging' vs. Neckbeard cop wannabes that drop money on elite items. This is GTA without the fun and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ player names attached to an even â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ier player base.   Skip on this one for your sake. Just get Saint's Row 3.
8185	0	a	Honestly, APB: Reloaded itself is great and fun. The game type is entirely unique, in that it's basically criminal gangsters versus lawful gangsters (Criminals vs Enforcers), destroying the city through random missions and the robbery of citizens' belongings by means of ram-raiding shop windows or mugging them on the street. The open world instances are flashy and fun to look at and explore, even if the majority of buildings can't be entered. The game's customization is, and maybe always will be, the best of its class -- if there even is another in that glorious top-tier -- simply because you can make your own theme songs, decals, and more through the in-game editors. Even if you aren't very good at art, you can still enjoy the simplicity of the game's customization, and make complex designs very easily.  The reason I don't recommend this game is because of the company that presently owns it: GamersFirst. Whatever good content they can add is made worthless by one of two means: The slow ranking system, or the simple fact that it's exclusive to the cash shop, making it one of the largest pay-to-wins I've ever played. There's also the major problem of cheaters/hackers, and the terrible security that's presently implemented. Still, I found a way to look past all of that and enjoy the game for about a year, even if the servers rubber-banded every now and then. Unfortunately, that rubber-banding has gotten worse over time, as the servers are simply getting more and more degraded by the second. GamersFirst is incapable of understanding that they need to upgrade these servers, and now the game is in a state where every movement has a 5-second delay, rubber-banding runs rampant, and disconnections occur every 5-10 minutes which won't allow you back on for another 20. GamersFirst does not understand the real ideas behind running a good game besides content, and in that they have ruined the experience of the game completely.  This is not the first good concept they've destroyed. WarRock is another shooter that now belongs to Nexon Europe, and once belonged to GamersFirst. The vehicles in the game are solid, and plays like a free-to-play Battlefield, in its own way. When my friends first told me about WarRock, the first thing they warned me to avoid was the public servers. I asked why and they gave me one answer: hackers. By the time I got that warning, though, I had already joined a public server and saw a flying tank getting destroyed by a glitched helicopter. I quickly left, and played in a private room with my friends, having a great time until the servers suddenly went down. They didn't come back up within half an hour, and we all decided to uninstall the game shortly after.   It saddens me that APB has been ruined by such a terrible company, to the point where I can no longer recommend it. I've heard rumors that Perfect World Entertainment is looking into buying APB: Reloaded from GamersFirst, and I must say that sounds like a far better idea than letting it run on the slowly melting servers it's running on now.
7976	0	a	there needs to be more added to the streets because they look so empty and i dont think it would be too hard to add stuff as to fill the streets. i think that they should bring out a update to do with the graphics needing to be re-done.. come on its comeing to 2016 there are alote of games that have better graphics and that are free as well.
3322	1	a	Not revamped, not rejigged, not redesigned. Reloaded. APB's new suffix is apt, as this free-to-play reincarnation of 2010's deflated cops and robbers MMO is a retread of the same ground. The same drab city, the same hollow combat, the same lopsided results.  The original city of San Paro has been left standing, a monument to badly judged level design and the colour grey. The first game's devs, Realtime Worlds, intended the place to live and breathe. Instead, it spluttered a few times before its life support failed. Its resurrection is a miserable one.  Reloaded's missions usually pit two small squads of human-controlled criminals and enforcers against each other, asking them to perform a multi-stage series of mini-jobs. One team has to drive to a place, collect a thing, and deliver it somewhere else. The other team has to stop them. Occasionally this leads to the kind of scenes that flicker through the minds of non-players when you describe APB to them: high-speed chases through busy streets, lastsecond jumps into getaway cars.  These do happen more regularly than before â little adrenaline shocks to punctuate hours spent bumbling around between jobs. More often, playing Reloaded's missions is like beating your head against one of San Paro's flat, grey concrete walls.  Mission locations are invariably overlooked by high ground. The first team to occupy that ground is the de facto winner, possessing sufficient cover to pop anyone who comes close. Grenades can't flush them out. Well-versed players will simply set up camp in an unassailable location and sit out ten minutes of screaming frustration. San Paro is so full of hiding spots and high ground that it's far easier to put someone else's mission under lockdown than it is to complete your own.  Urban renewal doesn't seem to have been high on GamersFirst's list of priorities: APB had the same spatial problems, and the same tiresome missions. The new devs have instead focused on the economy. Reloaded is free to play, supported by item, modification and vehicle sales, as well as a premium semi-subscription option. Steer clear of the latter and you get obnoxious little reminders telling you what you could've won in XP and in-game currency if you'd stumped up the cash.
457	1	a	A decent game , fun to play with friends 9/10
3087	1	a	When I first downloaded this game I jumped straight into it and have played it for 62 hours in total, it has its ups and downs. But also holds a great downside which is where newbies are being put up against veterans/experienced players. This could be fixed by adding 3 servers, one for low levelled players, one for higher levelled players and another one for mixed players where low levelled players can still go up against higher levelled players, this would be good because you could have a friend who is a much higher level than you when you're only level 1, you can just jump straight into the mixed server and join him/her
10536	0	a	This game was fun, emphasis on was. I played it back when it was good but after it got sold out it became this big money machine designed to suck your wallet dry of paypals.Not to mention the only way to enjoy this game after you hit lvl 20 is to get high tier gear which is pretty difficult to do when you die easily without the gear and you lose all your stuff upon death, thus you have to use real money to buy items.
4118	0	a	3 words: Pat To Win
6293	0	a	I've +500 hours (without steam) and i can easily say that devs don't care anymore. They don't try to keep cheats away. They just ban the ones using 'DETECTED' cheats. That isn't instant so they just open new accounts and keep cheating. Also you can pay for cheat. It is called 'ARMAS MARKETPLACE'. You can buy some weapons that is equal to cheat. You won't get banned for that though. By the way, when there is a patch i would get excited. I thought they will bring something new and good for the game. Every â¥â¥â¥â¥ing time i check the updates, I see more overpowered weapons and more bugs. Game is done for me.
8814	0	a	I did a previous review explaining why this was still a good game and delved into the issues with hackers and defended this company and game full heartedly. I then got false banned for 'hacking' under the new FairFight anticheat system, along with many others.   This was just another slap in the face by the ironically named 'Gamers First' company. Literally no proof is needed to be banned; so play this at your own risk because you are guaranteed to be an ignored, unvalued player.  I suggest that if the same thing has happened to you, consider filing a complaint against them to the BBB, they might still get away with it for now but eventually action will have to be taken. This is not okay and this company is scamming players.
6380	0	a	1.1 hrs was from the loading screen...
9085	1	a	They Basicly made this game for welfare bums that can't afford any FALLOUT GAMES.Fallout earth is a game about lag switching.And stealing from as many hardworking clans as you can...Gotta survive out in the wasteland.And pretend you're A girl so people give you free items and they can't kill you.

2619	1	a	WE HACK!
2133	1	a	I don't know about any of you but I enjoy the game. I haven't found it repetative like others say, but whatever. I would give it 7/10. Just like almost all games, I want to get that one thing and when I finally get it I don't want to play it anymore. So you wait a while and then the game gets fun again.  Describe this game in one word: Co-op
2076	1	a	A pritty fun game. u can be a cop or gamgsta. extream car chasings, lots of shootouts. pritty much all u can expect from a theme like that. and probably the best and most detailed caracter costumization i ever saw in a game.  Only think i dislike, or maybe am not used too. no headshots. at the end it comes 2 who has the gun with the most damage or who is tricky enough and gides behind walls or cars fast enough. At the end it is a pritty decent game, And funn too play
7102	0	a	They force you to give them you e-mail after install, and it takes forever to load.
2185	1	a	A good GTA like game that has a lot of customizations but it is multiplayer. A lot of missions and contacts that are fun to play with. But there are many hackers in the game which sucks. But it is really an awesome game after all. I will recommend this game to open-world gaming fans. :)
8414	0	a	By far the worst game 'on the market'. It has easily crumbled to ruins after what the current leaders have done to this game. They let it die and they ruined so much behind it. It used to be a fun, great, addicting game. But now it's a struggle just to even attempt to play the game. The issues that are presented are overwhelmingly frustrating. Let's talk about these flaws.  The connection issues that arose as of late making the game unbearable. The server has some serious kind of issues where the game freezes, your ping spikes up anywhere from 1-200 at this exact moment, your FPS drops up to 50% or more, and you start teleporting or 'rubber banding'. I have never, never in my entire life as a gamer, played an online game that had connections issues this bad. These spikes occur a few times throughout the minute, ranging from a couple to maybe 10 or even more.  Next, we get into the development of the game and who's behind it. Basically, the development is non-existant. This game has barley changed over the course of years. The original developers that had heart and care to make this game great and work on have been gone for quite a long time. We are presented with MEDIOCRE updates time and time again. The only updates that do come out take much too long and bring content that is meaningless. The big picture of this game is a complete failure. A new engine upgrade has been in the works for what, close to two years? Where is that development? We get pictures and false promises. False promises is all that this game is made of. The dev team is quite pathetic no matter what the size. I know teenagers that would do a better job with their amateur development skills in less than 3/4 of the then that of APB devs. And those devs that did stay up until recently are leaving to pursue better things.  There is simply no creativity left. There is nothing left. The game has no quality, it isn't fun to play. It's dying and it's been dying.  In game there are so many issues, so many things that need tweaking. The updates that we do get are horrible and frowned upon by the community time and time again. Lots of aspects in the game that are flawed, don't make sense. Bugs, glitches, stuff that has been here for YEARS completely ignored. Lots of cries that were never heard or reached out to. This is negligence at it's finest. The player never had a say in anything.  They attempted to merge the districts together in order to 'better' matchmaking and open more opportunities. However this was the start of all of the connection issues and the real death of this game. Even with the merge, the servers are very much dead. They have less players than the servers had alone before the merge.  This alone paints the picture of how this game has been going downhill.  Time and time again they neglect their fans that have been loyal all this time. And we get nothing at all in return. Customer support has forever been non existant and they really won't care to help you no matter what kind of issues you have. I have been faced with this multiple times. Gamersfirst staff only care about pushing more sales and more 'joker mystery boxes' because they think this is where the appeal lies. They only ever cared about the money. And nothing else. We are all bent over with our knee-pads on and sodomized terribly to this company.  Tiggs was the worst thing that ever happened to this game. I was never even slightly fond of her. She is just a muppet and her personality, tactics, and loyalties are a disgrace to the game. Why, out of all people, her? Just take a good look at this person and realize that she was a mistake.  Today stands the day where I lost everything I had for this game. There was a time I was so addicted I left my life behind for this game. A time where I considered this the best game of all time for how unique and creative it was, different for the time. It was that fun and addicting. However that is no longer. And if I were to rate this game today as it stands, I would give it maybe a 2.5/10. I even think the worst multiplayer game of all time (Infestation Survivor Stories) puts this game to shame.  I honestly hope that this game dies very soon or gets a major overhaul with a complete new owner and staff. But that won't. Once this game dies it will be taken into private hands and modded by fans that will make the game great again.
1795	1	a	This is a great game to play. It is an urban 3rd person shooter game that is an MMO Co-Op version Grand Theft Auto. It has a MMO RPG like system built into the game with progression, levels trading, ect. Tons of customizations to cars, clothing, weapons and charactors. The only issues with the game though are the expensive items and upgrades. Maintaining a lease on the weapons gets very expensive for pure free to play players. I highly reccommend that serious players go pay to play and get a perma weapon and side arm they always use. Also, the general community is poor and very trollish. If you can ignore the bad sides and stick to a good team of friends, it will be a fun game for you to play.
7940	0	a	10/10 would never play again. game sucks. small map just a really really crapy version of GTA  
5857	0	a	If you can actually log in its ok
8871	1	a	The 3 day install was my favorite part.
9750	0	a	Created an account, and it wont even let me log in. I tried my Steam username/password and the seperate account I had to create and both didn't work. Complete waste of time.
1773	1	a	A lot of the combat can be extremely one sided sometimes, especially with a group of friends who know what they are doing, and have ranks in the 200's. BUT, What keeps this positive for me is how fun it can be to just mess around and troll people, as well as the customization. I can't give the most detailed review, if you want that, look at all of the others.

4180	0	a	Doesnt load crap, freezes up lots, slow loading screen
9275	0	a	Another game that isn't made for Steam and should NOT be on Steam. Comes with it's own launcher with the most excrement like interface.  Requires account to be made.  Had only to jump through 100 hoops before I could play: Open with Steam -&gt; launcher -&gt; create account -&gt; opens website -&gt; create account -&gt; launcher login -&gt; launcher agreements -&gt; luncher checks local content just downloaded with steam -&gt; launcher downloads updates (although I just downloaded it from Steam) -&gt; open with steam -&gt; login with launcher -&gt; launcher agreements -&gt; check for updates -&gt; play  Horrendous movement, poor graphics, very very very unintuitive.   Couldn't make it past the first quest, so bad...

5635	0	a	WHY WAS THIS MADE   i cant even make a character, the story is horrible and gameplay is way too glitchy
6347	0	a	Pay to win   not a really good tutorial
9196	0	a	The graphics are terrible. Now, this wouldnt be so bad if its 2014 and the gameplay trailer had amazing graphics. At least with WoW they made the game a long time ago so its an excuse to not have good graphics, but this? But what is worse is the launcher. It took me 3 DAYS to download this dissapointment. To put that in perspective. I downloaded GTA 5, which is 16 gbs in 1 day. Fix your â¥â¥â¥â¥. The gameplay is clunky and the instructions are unclear. The first person mode is glitchy as all hell, and I could barely walk to the other towns without some high level destroying me. The story looks like it was pulled out of a toddlers imagination and turned into a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ vampire love story for teens. Also, the map is big. And I'm not saying this is bad, its just that the map is WAY TOO â¥â¥â¥â¥ING BIG. It breaks the gameplay and is so boring when I have to walk for 45 minutes just to complete a mission. I may have not played a lot, but I played enough.  Overall, this game is a big, dissapointing pile of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ 3d models and bad voice acting, peppered with bad camera angles and broken game mechanics. 2/10.

3073	1	a	great , love it
2216	1	a	it is telling me i need a apb laucher that i did not install it correctly what can i do to fix this issue
3653	1	a	5/10  Positives: Amazing character customization, great car customization, awesome music studio that allows other players to listen to the music that you create, ragdoll physics (hilarious), graphics and gameplay are decent  Negatives: A lot of cheaters and exploits, terrible customer support, terrible supporting company, cash shop, anti-hack is VERY outdated  Rant: GamersFirst is actually GamersLast. The negatives really outweigh the positives. I had alot of fun back in the closed beta, but G1 (GamersFirst) has allowed cheaters to stay in the game. This is due to the fact that GamersFirst makes tons of money from them. Smart on G1. Also, the players are constantly promised new content, but the new content never shows... unless it shows up on the ARMAS (cash shop).
927	1	a	This game is like Yoyaz's house.Dark and full of wierd smells.
5809	0	a	0/10 would uninstall again 
2941	1	a	Fun game, though slowly turned into a pay to win, but still, worth playing if new to the whole, MMO.
6449	0	a	This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ so boring and full of pay to win people
7687	0	a	Now I can see that this game definitely had a lot of potential in the beginning, but the end product is a broken mess that is confusing, tedious, and repetitive. The major upside of this game is that the character customization is far superior to many other games. Other than that, there's hardly anything worth mentioning about this game. My advice: Don't waste your time, and certainly DON'T waste your money on this game.
10494	1	a	Not a bad MMO for its age, its lowish graphics make it easily runnable on even the worst of potatoes. along with the crafting system being rather well done in my own opinion.
4018	0	a	While the graphics are good, it lacks in storyline and general flow. Nothing is really clear when you start the game, the map is confusing. Character Customization is good when you first start but if you want to customize further in the game with things such as weapons, or clothing then its very difficult and expensive. Combat is one-sided, with you being the lesser side and rather often dying and you're always resurrected way back at the beginning where you first started. Its gets a bit easier if you are playing it with friends but not that much. All in all out of 10, I'd give it about 4/10.
1838	1	a	First of all, for those who decide to play without a Premium subscription, the game is unforgiving and quite frankly, very frustrating. Every part of the game screams Pay-To-Win with unfair matchups, overpowered weapons, overpowered abilities, overpowered verhicles, high prices for items and so on. Many fights often end up being a question of 'who payed for what' and not 'who has the better skill', which is a real shame, because the the game itself is actually really fun. Everything is extremely customizable. From characters to cars to clothing. You'll never see the same character design twice. Also with activities such as robbing stores, jacking cars, muggin people etc., you can experience the life of the little Gangster you always wanted to be.  In short, for people who like GTA San Andreas-type of games, APB is a blast. Best played with friends and with a Premium subscription. If you don't want to pay or don't have the patience, quickly forget about this game, because it will make you go mad. Trust me.
4448	0	a	Customisation is awesome! although the gameplay is slow and boring.      4/10
4084	0	a	i am still having log in issues with this trash game 
7580	0	a	This game is complete â¥â¥â¥â¥... just spent the last hour downloading this and updating it to click a start butten telling me to like it after that nothing happens. i click the play butten on steam again and just get a blank screen.
8942	0	a	I played this game for many years before hand and when you see it now. The game is just a barren husk with no content to show for the years I've been away. Nothing new to make me enjoy it also. Everything is now just, boring in it.   Go with Fallout, you'll have more content at your hands than this game ever will.
3115	1	a	Fun game. Still getting used to it.
5894	0	a	Too many hackers and needs a performance/graphics update or something.
4883	0	a	This game is an awful P2W madhouse. The only reason I have so many hours in it is that the game did not shut down properly and was still read as 'running' by steam. I did not pay a single penny but I still felt ripped off.
6302	0	a	couldn't even get it to start yet it says i've played it for 8 hours
1237	1	a	I played this when it was in beta even though my in game hours don't show it. I can recomend this game to others.  Pros: Easy reward system for quests. Easy to fallow Quest system. Cars with atributes that are resonable( maybe not some will come with a big price tag on them), and some what customize-able. Striat forword Totrails when offered. Unlock ranks for some guns/ cars.  Cons: Like any other game that is free there is a paiying side, is the paying side rewarded more, yes and loads I haven't played in a while and can't tell but, some times on either(cops or criminals) side there would be an extremly high level high ranking player sitting on the edge of town with a sniper shooting into spawn, halours events fallowed. Car controls last I played were jarring and unstable unsre if it was becuase of type of car. (Yes that matters alot in ths game).  I cann not say much about the rest of the fetures of the game becasue I acullty haven't exploered all that much. I may change my review later for a better desription and general knowladge.
8607	0	a	This game sucks horsecock, DO NOT INSTALL THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥! even tho you aint doing mission and still are on tutorial u can get killed and has to waste another 3 hours on thes hitty â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. I promise you that will will uninstall this asap. I got 1 day premium and it â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up the game and my pc with 8gb ram ran this game smooth 3 hrs ago but after 3 hrs playhing this game it turned into complete â¥â¥â¥â¥.
6738	0	a	I got this game and every time i played the game would freeze about 4 minutes into a district. It also made me have problems with my computer and i had to call the company's support to fix the problem. I do not recommend that you download or play this game unless your sure it'll work good on your computer.
2122	1	a	You Want a cool looking avatar you need to spen at least three hours on it. you want a cool car 5 hours plus some money. you want to win? you either give up your life savings or your whole life
4742	0	a	This game is completely dog â¥â¥â¥â¥. Don't understand how people find enjoyment out of it.   
4009	0	a	It sucks. You can't even get past the tutorial and you basically do what you do in gta.  You drive drugdealer and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s over, just that you get no money. You shoot other people for fun.  Its funless, pointless oh and the Character Creating is half way broken.
8648	0	a	I probably haven't played APB Reloaded enough to call it trustworthy review. Still, there is a reason behind that. First of all, I played APB Reloaded over 2-3 years - first, when I just started my adventure with Steam, then few months later after some update and my last time was maybe half of year ago. Is this game bad? Not really. Is around 10 hours all the fun you can get from it? Probably not. When I started to play this game, I looked for something GTA-like but focused on online play.   And I found it. Played for a little while with my friend and we had some fun. Still, day after I started to play once again San Adreas multiplayer. After some time played it again and sadly, suddently this error on 32bit operation systems game wasn't playable at all. Some time later I changed my OS and tried it again. Sure, there were some players but once again I had fun only for short time. Played some missions together and one day uninstalled. Maybe it wasn't really for me? Or maybe because of lags, since there were countless time when I emptied my whole magazine shooting on enemy and didn't managed to kill him, only to find out that there was lag and I'm already dead.  I know one thing - it's free to play game, you can at least check it out. Maybe your experience with it will be much better and you will find something that is worth spending in your time. I probably won't install APB Reloaded again and even if I will, I doubt that my opinion will be changed.
673	1	a	puts a fun creative spin on cops and robbers with the adition of guns,cars and hole lot of customization toping it of with the fact  its massmultiplayer and free roam U CAN BE CRIMANLES AND KILL TINGS CAUSE U KNOW THATS WHAT CRIMS DO
10456	1	a	I mean, if you've always wanted to play Fallout but never could for whatever reason, then this game is not really like it. Though it is enjoyable.  7/James Franco
2494	1	a	ITs good .but beware of the lag friends .....!! LAG!! isay LAG!! It can be devastating ... WELL YOU CAN GET USED TO THAT I FEEL CALM WHEN I GET USED TO IT      LAG!!!! I SAY LAG!!
9755	1	a	This game has pretty much everything, except the usual dragons and things like that and thats the main part of the reason i like the game, im so fed up with RPGs always being some kind of D&amp;D spinoff.  I joined FE when it was still rather new and the seamless huge world in which it takes place, really appealed to me.  At some point though, this game went F2P instead of subscription based as it used to be and thats about when i stopped playing, because it became much like the channel packages u get u choose from at ur cable provider, where the basic setting contains all the crappy channels and the channels u really want, only comes in a bundle where u pay for 5 channels to get that single channel u actually do want.  I liked it better when FE was subsctription based, everyone contributed the same and everyone was equally set in the world of FE, no one had special advantages and the same amount of in-game effort, would earn anyone the same amount of gain.  Apart from that, the game has a ton of hrs of fun, especially if u team up with other players and maybe even join or found a clan.  The crafting system is brilliant, crafting takes quite some time (unless they changed it since i played that is), i recall it taking like 2 or 3 rl minutes to make a bandage and 10 mins to craft a small batch of ammo.  Crafting things like mounts, may take up to several days depending on the level of the mount and while that may seem like a lot, it soon becomes very natural in the game as u dont find urself waiting around for crafts to complete, because u actually learn to plan ur crafting and that becomes a part of the game that contributes to full experience in a very good way.  There are safe areas where other players wont be able to attack u and that makes it possible to settle as a crafter/merchant with little or no fighting skills and as u can have more chrs, u can do good by building a 'money farmer' to supply ur fighter chr with money.  Missions are good and works well and u are free to complete the missions over and over again to farm special drops, xp etc.   Beware that like i said, its been quite some time since i stopped playing and some things may have changed. The only change im pretty sure of that hasnt happend but has been awaited since the game came out, is player housing, that part unfortunately doesnt exist, so everything u gather in game will have to be stored in 'vaults'.  The vault system works well though, its put together of different vault types where some vaults appear more often than others, so the stuff u need the most, will have to go into the standard vault in order to be easily accessed from 'anywhere'.  The vaults has a fixed amount of slots and ofc u can buy more slots by paying money, but at least (afaik) its still a one time fee.  When u pay real money, u can get your xp gain furthered and basically it means, if u wanna level at a descent and not too boring speed, u will have to pay and so it goes for other things as well.  Id still vote that this game goes back to subscription based, so that a good handfull of the players wont have to pay for all of those who play for free.  The only good thing about F2P is that u get to try before u buy, but that couldve been achieved with a normal demo, i seem to recall that when i joined FE, it had a demo that allowed u to play until u reached level 15 or so, after that u couldnt level any further.  Playing until level 15 were more than enough to decide whether to buy the game or not.
8240	0	a	this game does not start after i click start it just does nothing and i cant get on the starter now
3751	0	a	Date was like 2/3 years ago.  I've played this game for years and right at the end it turned into a Pay to Win game with hackers every where.  Im not going to pay 40$ for a Ingame gun...  Since people keep commenting on my Review here is an update to stop everyone arguing with me.  The premium Weapon are Far better like the shotgun has a fixed pattern to its spread so if aimed right it would one shot you. The premium HVR allowed you to run with it when the non premium would not. The premium Car parts gave a boost to you vehicle to allow you to over power non premium users. the list can go on of small things that over time will add up..  I under stand they need to make money to keep the game alive... however I believe it should be kept at a cosmetic level of game play not core mechanic of the game.. not to mention the idea of renting a gun for a week for real money or spending 40$ US to own the gun, Like really I might as well buy another game for that price..   Bottom line is I shouldn't have to be a MLG level of gaming just to compete with some casual gamer who spends 80+ dollars a week to get an over powered weapon/car.

9469	1	a	Started to play because of the post-apocalypse feel. Stayed for the random flashmob dance :P
4261	0	a	This game is buggy even with decent hardware. Apart form that, it has tons of security holes which means hackers can easily deface this game. And the punkbuster is a wase of time. Plus, it has become a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ pay to win.
6269	0	a	The game wouldnt get past the splash screen. Yeah I googled that you could run the exe by itself, but even then it took a very long time to actually load so I didnt bother...
5699	0	a	Horrible
2138	1	a	I played this game befor it was on steam and I like it. The custimization is everything. no Joke if it is in the game you can custimize it. A game I suggest to play. But the game gets repetitive, and some weapons like the sniper rile ae over powered. And people like streaking so yah. p.s. JOKER AMMO HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.
4961	0	a	well having about 400 hours on the game and spending approx. $200 i get banend for 'cheating' and after that its just horrible, game is only focused on irl $ and without $ theres no fun to it
6692	0	a	Pay to play garbage. I hope you like renting weapons, because that's all you're going to get to do unless you drop real cash. The combat is third person awkward and boreing.

5723	0	a	As much as I like the idea, and feel that if it was a bit better made that it could be something wonderful, it's just not that good. If it wasn't P2W and was polished up, the game could be SO MUCH BETTER. If somebody actually made this better, it would be one of the best games IMO, but I just don't see it ATM.

5744	0	a	spent all my time playing in a laggy as â¥â¥â¥â¥ character creator that didnt even change some aspects of the character even when i was supposedly changing them, just to sit at a forever 'Connecting to District Server...' screen.  no, its not my end that is faulty. i have high end hardware(not some junky poor man's piece), win7 ultimate 64bit(its â¥â¥â¥â¥ing 2015, no reason to have 32bit unless its for softwar specific needs, which is what compatibility mode is for.... so still no reason for 32bit), high end internet in a suburb area(not junky comcast out in the middle of nowhere), and all gigabit/cat6 networking. Perfect connection to other US servers (and a few EU and JP servers), but not this one. I cant even properly review this game, because i cant even get it to work.
10003	0	a	its so bad dont download 
4745	0	a	This game sucks more â¥â¥â¥â¥ than a two cent â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. You go against people who are 10X your level, pay2win everywhere you look, and worst of all, the company reminds you of modern Blizzard (Which sucks â¥â¥â¥â¥) Don't bother playing this game if you don't have money to spare, because it's either be scammed and buy weapons, or lose and waste space.
8818	0	a	This game is getting dead faster and faster. perfect, but its your bad, devs, you dont give a single one about the community. only the new thing you release is an update with a car that can only be bought with some p2w cash? really? this is just fun  APB 2010 - 8/10 was fun APB:Reloaded - 0/10 just awful  Let me just put this into a small review of APB:Reloaded  This game community is absolute garbage, it is the most pay2win game I ever seen, devs dont give a â¥â¥â¥â¥ about the game, matchmaking is the worst, worse than cod, bad performance, if you have wealthy mum with some huge â¥â¥â¥ money filled credit card, play this game.  if you dont... please, dont even install this game and just give it a 'No' at your review. this garbage doesnt belong on steam.

8765	0	a	I don't recommend this game for a number of reasons  1. Takes a hour and 1/4 of a hour just to set it up and play the damn game  2. Vey laggy, laggiest game I ever played on Steam  and 3. The loading times, are so damn slow!
5114	0	a	Trash
3811	0	a	No, just no With Friends maybe yes but alone NO itâs not safe outside anymore! The new Slogan for this game might as well be   'Its just a prank bro!' 'why so serious' 'noob noob noob'   I was also hunted down for having an Iron cross. The SJW Furry-sect clearly hate everything German!  That is the community. Equal to a fake prank Social Justice Fury Vegan Gains Feminist Hilary Supporters Religious Warriors ISIS Onision channel!!! There is NOTHING WORSE than those combined.  Iâm DONE WITH THIS GAME!!!!!!!  p.s I donât have a thing with furies no. I just put you there because Keck.  Also Vegans, yea its the behaviour that makes you unpopular.  As for the rest Steam salty everywhere brah
10632	1	a	2nd Best Free to Play EVER
6887	0	a	The free version is very hard to play. You are dead, dead, dead and dead. Running through the city with simple SMG, then someone with RPG blast you from behind. And again and again.
10034	1	a	I played this game in Beta, and it has come so far since then. Great graphics, target orriented combat, thousands of missions, best crafting system Ive seen in a game (you can be all proffesions) and random bonuses. Everyone is on one server. I subscribed, but there is no need to, f2p offers a ton in itself.
7482	0	a	love the game but all the hacks in this game, it's just â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. and it sucks how there are no npcs to even fight either. it's strict always pvp fighting but I'd love there to be PvE fighting in the game also.
39	1	a	Its a lot of fun, but I wouldn't recommend it if you're one of those - like me - who gets frustrated when you die.  This is a game of skill. There's no classes and no real perks or talents that can give you an advantage in a fire fight. Buying weapons character modifications (such as body armor) can increase your chances, but only slightly and will not necessarily make it impossible for a new player to kill you if you make a mistake.
7228	0	a	$%#^ PUNKBUSTER! All i have to say!
4427	0	a	I could write a long review explainging in detail its failures and succsesses but i'll be short. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME UNLESS U WANT TO BE â¥â¥â¥â¥ED IN THE BUTT BY HACKERS. Unless you are a hacker yourself then i recommend this game 10/10 hackingsimulator 2014  This game will will put your hacking skills to the limit. can you outhack your oponent? (enter epic battle music of your choice) Also it runs like a giant turd, not even a small turd, the biggest, smelliest, brownest turd you have ever seen in your life. its truly a sight to behold. It doesnt matter how good you get at this game because some asshat will be using the OP pay to win weapons. even worse, when you begin your journey into the city of San Paro you will probably be up against the best players with the most op guns. â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS GAME
5356	0	a	This is where trolls go to die, i hope this game lasts forever so they never stop playing
915	1	a	Free 2 Plays are the great.
10797	1	a	Frantic, flashy and fun. This game tests your relfexes and skills as you make your way through the realm of the mad god. The aim: The aim of the game is to level up, accumulate loads of fame, and to defeat Oryx the mad god. Likes: I love this game because it's fun and a good challenge, it's also surprisingly fun to play with a friend. The guild system is well designed, and easy to use/run. Dislikes: While their are a few faults with the game there are _ main problems. Number 1: It's very flashy and in your face, especially in the Godlands, so if you've got epilepsy, I wouldn't advise going to the godlands if you want to get this game. Number 2: You have to pay to get anywhere in this game. Summary: Overall I'd reccomend this game, but only if you're willing to pay a little bit. There done.

7481	0	a	I hate this game! Everybody you come across seems to be a much higher level than you with lots of game experience and awsome weaons, as for me, I only just started and got anihalated by averyone. They all had rocket launchers and grenade launchers, all I had was a pistol and SMG!
9742	0	a	It was so glitch broke my PC and there was no transportation
7045	0	a	This is an ANTI-recommend. A game that keeps crashing on the character creator is a game that's hardly worth it. Considering its troubled history back from when it was a pay game, it's not worth it as free, either.
3952	0	a	As a start,sure it is an interesting game.After a few days it gets repetitive.From missions to customizations and so on. The game itself has a great base.Criminals against the Police,a great idea.Were the game starts to break down it is in it's execution,and the outside.In the trailers you can see that it's possible to make artwork with the creation tools.Well,yes you can,but you will soon see that it's limited,only an amount of geometric shapes you can use,same to the cars,clothes etc. One of the things that killed me is that everything was limited.I put a lot of money in this because I had hope. The matches are stupidly done.I couldn't play because it wasn't fair.They put 2 dudes with rank over 20,against 2 with over 10. The only thing that counts as 'fair' is how many people vs how many people.I couldn't level up,only if I was very good at it,and I wasn't.It's the same thing,even if you are a cop or a criminal.Criminal:Go and rob something,steal a car,go to a point,capture a point,protect a point or just transport an object without the cops seeing you.Cop:Go and stop the criminals from doing all that. There is no easy way of making money since the matches are soooo unfair.Only one way and it's only for criminal(sorry cops). It's basically destroying with your car shops windows.It's a boring way,but it's worth it.The shops will drop a few objects that you have to pick up and put in a car.Then go to an AI and give the stuff,after that go to another place to get the money for it.This way I made about 20-30k a day,but again it was getting boring. I found that one thing was funny,was playing with your friends,it has a massive multiplayer.So I was actually having fun,even if I was dead or alive. The game itself has a hidden wall in front of it.It doesn't let you pass that much,most of the cool things are either for premium or they are hard to get,and only if you are good.I am not saying that you cannot get good items without paying or premium,if you are good,you can get cool items.But it's really hard to get good.When I say good I mean 'super good'. The game also has clans,I had one but it was pretty dumb and lame.You can make a icon for the clan and spray it on special spots in the city.And it is true that you can actually make songs.I found myself creating a lot of music,so that will be fun. This game has a short amount of 'gamemodes'.There are two cities,they are basically the whole game.Then there's these 2 place from both cities,where there is like a 'free for all' gamemode,and the famous 'Hanging Plaza'.Where you create,buy,and sell. In a nutshell this game needs a lot of improvement.It is fun,but you will find it anoying after a while.So it does not worth your time.You can try playing it a few hours,but that's all.You will get bored.I must say that the game is full of glitches and bugs so watch out for that,some are funny,but some aren't.Even after many laughs it will started sucking your soul and just turn into a pain in the leg.Don't bother with putting any money in it.Play for a while and if you aren't 'super good' at it,just delete the game,it will get repetitive and you will get nervous because you can't killed anybody(because all over 20).If you aren't good at beating people that have over your rank,just leave it. In the end this game is something that should'va been developed by someone else.Someone who actually knows how to make a multiplayer game.If you haven't played the game,just try it and the play something else.I played it too much,I was frustrated that I wasn't killing anybody.Warning!YOU WILL NEED A GOOD COMPUTER! If you are reading my review,just don't touch it.It doesn't worth your time,go and play GTA or Saints Row instead of this thing. So this game gets the rating of 3/10,an epic fail.The idea is good,they screwed it up.Now it's just a stupid,frustrating game that gets a lot of bad reviews.After a spoiler that it will be gta 5,and a few changes of title,all developted by someone who doesn't know how to make games like this.This is what you get,you get 'A.P.B.:Reloaded'. And if you say 'Changes of title?'.Yes,the game was once called 'All Points Bulletin''(A.P.B.).There was no 'Reloaded'.Go google and get more indepth informations about the past game.I don't know that much about it. SO GO AND BUY OTHER GAMES,EVEN THOUGH THIS GAME IS FREE,GO AND PLAY GTA:SA INSTEAD OF THIS CRAP!

4585	0	a	Unfortunately, while this game is unique in that you unlock clothes and character customizations as you play, you have to deal with trolls and hackers (which unfortunately the game devs vehemently deny, because of their 'hackguard software' is good... Like 6 years ago..) Some days the trolling can be so bad, that when I do play anymore, I am usually sitting on roofs sniping NPC characters with a handgun or using the van that I eventually unlocked to smash storefronts to rob them.. Missions are only really enjoyable if you have friends playing with you that can calm you down when you end up queued against a team of max rank gold players whom are only on your server to troll because they claim to not be able to fill their own gold server (which they have and have had for several years) but in actuallity prefer trolling people that they know that they can beat (Less experienced players), rather than fighting people of their own calibur. Weapons are another can of worms all together. Permanent box weapons, which can cost you an arm and a leg, can turn an unskilled player into god with no effort whatsoever, even the rank unlocked guns and cars are junk next to the purple and gold weapons and cars in the G1 and Joker stores. On a side note, I do have a few permanent weapons and cars, from owning the retail version of the game, but even those are inadequate to the newer stuff that comes out every few months. At least my retail cars have mobile supply to let me change out gear in the middle of town.  Still it is much funner to ride around town shooting NPC, mugging, storefront robbery and grand theft auto, then playing the missions with unfair ranking. Money can even be made if you learn how to manipulate the Music Maker and clothes designers and sell what you make on the players market. I used to make money nearly everyday selling death tunes in the tune of Nyan Cat and Still Alive. The company claims to have unfair ranking and hacking under control, but this cannot always be seen when playing.
6732	0	a	I've been playing since the RTW Edition, the community on the current APB is terrible, hackers are a common problem on APB, and G1 refuses to do anything about it, the guns are unbalanced and it is extremely repetitive. Matchmaking is terrible, you are paired with people not even close to your skill level. G1 Keeps adding guns that are pay to win, and refuses to fix the coding and scripting errors that this game boasts. They say they are making a physics engine update, however that Is a huge lie, they are showing little evidence to prove it and they said it would take a few months to implement, it has been a year atleast now. Their moderators are terrible, the one I will use as a example, Tiggs. She is a power hungry, abusive, and flat out â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ moderator, anyone with a opinion that differs from hers is banned, and if you have a question she uses her mother mentality of 'Because I said so.' Many people I know have filed reports to the better buisness bureau due to apbs incapability to help customers when they're money is taken from them and they dont recieve the product they pay for. G1 simply says its customer error and keeps your money.

6178	0	a	Its a pretty average game at best. Its just a gta ripoff with bad graphics poor driving mechanics buggy af takes too long to load. its pretty fun for the first 10 minutes but just gets repetitive and boring. overly complicated and just glitchy. if you want to try a free poorly made version of gta san andreas then this is the game for you

6686	0	a	This game was the best ive ever played until they started rolling out the Pay to Wins thats when everything went to â¥â¥â¥â¥. i means really the matching making was horrible. people blatantly hacking, and the server lags. with the so much money they get on this game they choose not to fix it. i tried to tell them on facebook but they block me from commenting on anything they post. i guess they dont want to hear a fan of the game opinion about their game. i would have recommended this game in a heartbeat but now its just a Pay to Win Simulator
7789	0	a	this game sucks its like 1fpm i cant even delete it with out it saying please close apb reloded well it is close
104	1	a	What I love about this game is that it is much more of out smarting your opponent than having a better gun. Even though sometimes guns can be over powered, most are balanced but easily better in certain situations. But with the proper team anything can be done. This game has it's glitches though and lag but nothing game breaking in my opinion. And hey it's free. If you do put money into it though it will reward your experience.  But the gameplay isn't the only thing that makes APB special. The customization is almost limitless. I've made several characters from movies (Batman, Iron Man, Captain America, Punisher, Superman etc.) and it's a lot of fun in my opinion. The customization is way beyond most games period. If not the best.  People are trying to fix some of the problems in the game as well. We'll be due for a new engine update soon, so hopefully that will fix most of the issues.  All in all this is my all time favorite MMO. Will you like it? I have no idea, but you should try it!
9334	1	a	Please make Russian language 
5332	0	a	Pathetic.  EDIT:  Wasted 6 years of my life on this sad excuse we call a game.
6611	0	a	Nope. This game has absolute potential, but new players are vulnerable to hackers and higher ranks with overpowered weapons. Don't waste your time installing this game, unless you want to get blown up by a pornstar with an RPG and rage over it. The only good thing about APB: Reloaded is the character customization. Not friendly to newcomers, you have to pay2win. Uninstalled immediately.
4609	0	a	the game is bad optimized my computer nearly exploded NOW I HAVE 8GB RAM THIS IS WORST GAME ON STEAM EVER

9440	0	a	Ok I'd really didn't play the game but it has â¥â¥â¥â¥ graphics and im pritty shore i had difficulties with the key binding WHAT i mean is its different to to games like this and at the start it was â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥T i could not loot the bodys that NPC KILLS YES THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ING NPC I dont know if this effects the game later on but thats it hop it helps.
1809	1	a	Awesome for a Free game but you do often get â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ by ads to upgrade... but here's a little known secret APB actually stand for Angry Pensioner â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥es. Plus much arousal can be gained from breast modification.
6934	0	a	Rank 53 without knowledge against Rank 198. Mission Matchmaking System 11/10. Even Tetris is more fun.
199	1	a	Very Fun game with others. Would recommend to play with a group of friends talking using skype,mumble etc.
4425	0	a	it takes forever to load up the game and even then its buggy the anti cheat system doesnt work at all even though they have been doing this for fifteen years and even when there are no cheaters the game crashes and for no reason punkbuster say you have been cheating even when your not .  so all in all i do not reccomend this game because it is cheap and a â¥â¥â¥â¥ gta . DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY AND OR TIME
8178	0	a	pay to meme
5008	0	a	A complete waste of time with faulty matchups, unexplained gameplay and aspects of the game specifically designed to taunt you.
2046	1	a	APB:Reloaded is the game you keep going back to but at times you don't know why. All in all it is a GREAT game, but sometimes the Community can be a little-a lot rude and the company definitely takes their time with the less important things to fix like the Threat and Matchmaking system.  There are Hackers and Macro users just like any other game. There aren't as many as there used to be but when they do appear now, they're just blatant.   If you're going to start the game off without a friend I would suggest starting off as a Criminal. They can Ram Raid and mug for cash, but as an Enforcer you can witness criminals doing such things. That's a gamble though, with premium and effective play Missions are an amazing source of money. But like I said, as a newbie Ram Raiding would be the way to go.   Asylum and Baylan Shipping are NOT the place for a newbie to be, Hang out in Financial or Waterfront until you get used to the game and unlock some more guns. Play around with your mouse sensitivity until you hit the sweet spot. Guns like the OCA (SMG's) are great starter guns along with the Ntec and the Star 556 (Assault Rifles).   Some people will say Pay 2 Win exists, I don't agree because the Oca, Ntec, and Star are some of the BEST guns in the game that you can get at a very low rank, you will unlock slotted guns for mods to greatly increase the performance or unlock guns that already have mods installed that you cannot change.   Aside from the bad things about this game, it's a great game. I give it a 4/5 for functionality, 2.5/5 for Community, 5/5 for Gameplay, and 4/5 for Story.  
4709	0	a	An okay game, I wouldnt recommend though. Alot of the servers are laggy, the community isnt the best, and quite frankly its really a pay to win kinda game. there are alot of other free to play games out there, and quite frankly id rather pay money for GTA or gmod (gamemodes) to play something like this.
5742	0	a	In my 4 hours that i have played this, i have experienced hell. the hud is barely managable, im barely able to understand whats going on around me. ive read almost 3 guides on this game. all wasted time. when i got into my first mission we had already lost. i made it to the objective to be shot down and killed in a single bullet. second mission, same thing. third, fourth i was catching on, all the players i were playing against had spend money on this game. i dont spend money on free to play games, and when i do its when i really enjoy it and want to support the game. (ie rift, neverwinter, and team fortress 2). i am not going to sit back and be completely destroyed by people who have wasted money on a concept that is beyond convulted and overdone. not to mention, all the servers on here are over flooded with idiots and racist â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s. so, 2/10. not even that. -10/10.
6724	0	a	This game is deader than the zombie apocalypse, the nuclear fallout, or whatever disaster that decreases human population density up to 50 square miles per person per server region.   If you played the game right now, you will get to be a part of a special few that have spent too much money to let the game go. Also some people just can't play the game without 'trainers'.  You want to play with the same person every night? That have been playing years before you? Has tricks that you don't have? I guess this game is for you.   As a person that has been a commune to the game before, my warning of this game being a 'Gold' drainer has not been heeded 5 years ago. Buy permanent to win or pay premium to be financially stable to even participate in the whole item customization and selling experience.  Yes you will have to rent guns that expire weekly if you have not bought any. Expire weekly.  If not bought. Up to 20k gold for a gun. When a maximum amount possible weekly earned is a little 5k. Not counting the the little Cops and Robbers sideshow that earns more money than the actual missions, nobody does that anymore.   The new guns that came out on the market is to say 'Sorry but we are too lazy to fix the weapon balance, here buy these new ones instead'. Those guns are not 'rentable'.

7278	0	a	I downloaded this game, thinking it looked like a lot of fun. However, as of yet, I have been unable to play as it has been plagued with problem after problem, without ever successfully getting into the game. First, constant 'updating' that never stopped, even though it said everything was up to date. Then, after finally getting passed all that, it said the game was running. I have yet to figure out where it is, in fact, running, other than using memory. Steam says i've played 47 minutes, apparently it counts updating or something for play time. As soon as I restart my computer ( I have to restart it to even delete it ), this game will be gone. I hope they'll get it a little more under control at some point so I can check it out.
9178	1	a	I loved this game, it's just so addicting! The only problem I have withit is the ocasional lag. But besides that it's fun!
3563	1	a	Fun game, until you realize you're going to get murdered every round unless you use ACTUAL MONEY to buy FAKE MONEY to buy FAKE GUNS that you only get for a limited time. unless you PAY MORE ACTUAL MONEY to realize that there isn't much more to do.  The outfit and car customization is cool, and there is some cool stuff you can do with it, but ,most things you get ideas to do, you can't. The customization menu for clothing has a limited amout of symbols you can place down, which can limit your creativity in some cases. Same thing goes for the car creator, with an even less amount of symbols you can place. If you have a lot of money to spare and are ok with it going to limited things, then you'll end up with a good looking character and car.  For the rest of you, good luck.  TL;DR: Fun game with customizable cars and outfits, until you realize it's a pay-to-win. Play for a while, don't get your hopes up for something extremely amazing.
415	1	a	gut game, i rate 5/7 p2w
1986	1	a	I cant get in from this game 
2973	1	a	Amazing game, defenately worth a try. However, preapare to grind a little for good items.
9655	1	a	very addicting game
7085	0	a	Have you ever wondered what it would be like to play a game funded entirely by players who buy one-shot-kill weapons with real money?  Look no further.
699	1	a	this game is pay 2 win if you want to level up only with G1 Credits  i dont say we have pepole that dont buy G1 Credits and they succses in this game but mostly you need to buy G1 Credits because the weapons there is OP = over power..  so have fun and dont spent a lot of money :D  
2759	1	a	Needs a Mac version of this game ASAP!
10714	1	a	Realm Of The Mad God(RotMG) is one of my favourite games is steam right now. You willl be facinated of what classes to unlock and what items the game Has in store For You At First, you will feel Bored but when you get to lvl 20 your life will be change forever. This game is a retro 8-bit style game.It has Alot of classess to be unlocked and lots of items. It is a perma death game too. so if u die then u must create a new character again.But this is the type of challenge that we want in the community and it will be rewarding after you kill Dungeon Bosses to get Soulbound bags.What are Soulbound Bags? Well they are loot that are in a specific bag color. The colors ranges from Purple , Cyan and white. White Bags Are the hardest to get but has good stuff inside and you have pets too who has alot of abilities which can aid you in battle. the places you should avoid unless you have better equips and at least lvl 20 which are Godlands(glands).You can die Pretty much instantly by some gods like Medusa(Snake Head Lady),Leviatan(Blue Creature) and Djinns(blue creature that shoots snowballs) and more.Whenever you feel your screen shaking, its time to meet Oryx.Oh and expect death whenever that happens because he is the hardest boss in the game and alot of players die by him.so i recommend you to nexus or die a brave person.Whenever you die, dont be sad just think about what your next character is gonna be and start over again.Remember Guys, EXPECT DEATH!!  -StxofDark(RotMG Username0
5269	0	a	Ok people this review is going to be quick.....This game is one of the best PAY TO WIN GAMES OUT THERE.
3028	1	a	the first game to come to mind when play ABP is gta5 online with the cosrimization of everything
90	1	a	APB is a great game though it has a toxic community that might deter new players. It's a milestone for customization in games. You can cuztomize any part of your character (height, weight, muscularity, freckles, hair) you can make your own symbols to use on clothes and tattoos and cars. You can cuztomize your car with kits, symbols, upgrades, paint jobs, etc. The player can also cuztomize their weapons with skins and upgrades. Most of my time is spent socializing, driving, and designing then showing off my clothes. I highly recommend it to anyone with a creative mind.
3498	1	a	Great game!
4595	0	a	Worst game i ever seen,  Its impossible to play on here, lags everywhere even if i have a GREAT computer. When it crashes, it screws all my system up and then i have to restart my comp.  And its like this from the start of the game, its getting much worse than the old times. Dont download it, youll regret if you do.
4803	0	a	Worst game ever! Horrible gameplay, it's loading like forever and I could go on. Terrible experience.
6833	0	a	Wallet theifs &amp; Un-Active Admins 0/10

806	1	a	Free, Online, Cops and Robbers, Whats Not to Love? Just get it You'll Understand
4148	0	a	Do i recommend this game to other players? no. why?  1.Match Making system is bad (Example: a player played the game for 50 hours can matched with a player who played 800 hours.  Another example if this game is like League of Legends, they are making bornze fight platinum or gold fights diamond)  2.hackers (Some top rank players can be hacker)  *3.They want money ( what i mean is that fix the game is not their primary, they made more things to buy and try to attract more players)  4.Bad performance(Server like waterfount is not stable, ping jumps from 50 to 500)  But if you want to know the good side of this game, here is what i found.  1.customize ( custom your clothes , your car , your music , or the troll music that the player gonna hear it after you kill them.)  2.you are playing with 100 people ( The idea of have a free world and your battles can be any where in the map is great and the missions can get effect by other players that have nothing to do with you is interesting, it makes you feel you are playing a lots of people not just a server with 10 people in it)  3.Freedom( There is more other then just doing missions,  you can play fight club if you don't feel like to finish a whole match, that you can quit any time you want and you will still get rewarded.  Or you just don't feel like you want to fight, you can just drive in the free world or you can go to social district talk to other people, looks at other people custom maybe get some new idea and use on your own, trade, make your self look more badass or cute, make some music etc)  4.Is a mixed game , it can cover a lot( Is a shooter game but is also a driving game, it can even be strategy game or a rpg, it have skills on character , guns , and cars . It have a lot to explore)  And that is the good side and the bad side of this the game. I would say if you do not have the patience then this game is not for you, the good stuff doesn't come if you can't pass it's dark side first . However if you have patience and are interest what it have to offer to you, you can try but no guaranteed you will get what you want.
4263	0	a	Used to be fun back at the day but let's have a review shall we? No? Well go â¥â¥â¥â¥ yourself. This game used to be the best back when it came out. It's like GTA but free version and pay to win version. As you spawn... you look ugly af and ugly â¥â¥â¥ car. Not even a car! Just steal one. But then you see other people with awesome â¥â¥â¥ guns, cars, outfits. Can't do â¥â¥â¥â¥ pretty much. Well... dissapointed..
7240	0	a	If u ready pay for cool new stuff than itÂ´s a game suited for you. The Hackers make the game impossible to enjoy. The Game itself would be better if the dev would change this into leveling through. I know everyone wants to make money but be so greedy is worse. GTA Online is the same if u have money than you rule. Btw the basic idea for the game is good and it would be a great game to waste u time on it if they remove the p2w.
7418	0	a	Boring
2615	1	a	VERY good customization, anything from clothes to cars to your own EYES can be customized almost infinitely! Gameplay is solid, has very good shooting mechanics and the misson system is just to die for, however the car driving seems to lag for me, (probably my crappy internet), but it is still a very engrossing game, i played 8 hours last night, all in all 9/10, i reduced the score by one since latency issues are a bit to severe even for people with good internet.
3961	0	a	Although this game has lots of potential, I myself have found a few things wrong with it:  Firstly, the game is simply too resource-demanding. I myself have an Alienware 14 with a NVIDIA GeForce GT 750M, and 8GB of memory. To start with, this $1,000 laptop barely even runs this game on moderate graphics settings, forcing me to switch to low-end graphics just so the game can have a smooth, playable framerate. MAYBE this is something wrong with my laptop, but I think not.  Even playing on the lowest graphics settings possible, the game still manages to lag and otherwise have random FPS drops that would often result in instant death in the middle of a firefight. The vehicle control feels a little too arcade-y for my liking. In addition, there is a rather alarming population of cheaters on servers. Utilizing a mathematical formulaâ100 missions played, averaging 4 players to each faction for each missionâI found that over the course of those 100 missions that a total of 89 people were hacking in some way, shape, or form. If we conclude that in 100 missions that you will encounter 700 people (800 minus yourself in each mission), there is an average hacker ratio of 0.127 (12.7%). While Reloaded Production's newest Fair Fight Anti-Cheat Technology should help reduce this number, I still can see a large population of hackers managing to bypass this.  Regarding the servers, their software is outdated and faulty at best. Only the dedicated servers seem to run anywhere near smoothly, but even then their calculation systems and arithmatic formulas often result in a laggy experience.  Pros:  Decent graphics Dynamic gameplay ENDLESS character customization  Cons:  Requires a high-end gaming laptop in order to run smoothly Arcade-esque vehicle handling Combat utilizes hit-scans, which often bugs Outdated servers High hacker population  Overall score: 5.1/10.  This game USED to be fun, but sadly, they have moved away from their original roots of entertainment. The best that I can say about it is that it is merely a laggy, ramped-up version of cops-and-robbers that we all played as little kids. If you are looking for a decent F2P game, I would advise you to look elsewhere.
10008	1	a	i can't login,so i can't get on to atually play someone please help. t
8323	0	a	didn't work for me and looks really cool butt didn't work for me
8885	1	a	I highly recommend Fallen Earth as a long time player I've seen this game go from greatness down to the mud and back again. The community is great and has a high loyal player base. No other game that I have ever played has brought me back to it as much as this one has. I see many negative reviews on this but if u notice their play time in game its less than 2hrs at most. Dont be fooled the game is even better with a low player count, it truly does give it that feeling of an apocalypse. Instead of running into someone every 2 secs considerably takes away the immersion of being a post apoclyptic game.   I highly recommend this game, Join Royal Bloodline a noob helping clan.
1498	1	a	This is a very great game, i love this game! Its the best game i have seen some its free&lt;3
4622	0	a	It's probably one of the worst games I've ever had the misguided pleasure to play.Terrible community, bad game mechanics, that sort of stuff. But it's strangely addicting the first time around, so you keep playing and playing, even though you know its absolute garbage. I can't explain it really. It's like bad drugs or cigarettes, its â¥â¥â¥â¥ for you but you keep coming back.   Overall: Best game I ever had the pleasure of uninstalling.
5771	0	a	This is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game!

3677	1	a	  Gets game on laptop. Runs at ultra and plays for 25 hours. gets on new gaming pc. cant even get to the luancher before steam crashes.   I do reccomend this game  attempts to fix. 
4990	0	a	this game is frustrating because for some reason i cannot close it
8368	0	a	Best example of a pay-to-win I have ever witnessed.
7230	0	a	This game is just â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, getting dced every 30 min. bad match up, server is dead.
9259	1	a	Absolutly Love this game, im an off and on player, and enjoy it more and more very time i come back. Give it a chance and learn it, you will love it. -Mister Schmitz ingame.
128	1	a	Very addicting game once you get to know how to play it. Everyone may not like it, because its difficult at first. There are some bugs/crashes, apart from that, great game (especially with friends). 9/10.
7060	0	a	It takes way to long to get started I was bored of this game before I even got to play it.
5885	0	a	It crashes every time i press start. This game need fix.
3438	1	a	It was a great game untill I went over to a Mac. Could the developers, if it's possible, try to make it available for Mac users also? This was by far one of my favorite games to play and I'm wishing to play this game again on my stronger computer.
10383	0	a	Well i played this game like 3 years ago, everything was so cool back then. After a while me and my buddy reached end game, joined clans blah blah, game suddenly became less enjoyable not because of bugs, glitches, but the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ness of GMs. I had so many play hours in this game, but the game never changes. And the Gms + Support never care for players, all they care is money. If you really want to play this game, think again.
1784	1	a	Best game. When you really get down to it and ignore some of the connection problems that happen sometimes because of new updates and really understand the game and what to do. (Winning helps) It's really a great game. Tip: If ur a silver or a bronze unless you like challenges never join silver or gold servers, Bronze is where it's best at.
4518	0	a	Pay to Win, played it to mutch because I played it whit friends, it was just a waste of time
8395	0	a	A dumbed-down and broken version of Saints Row.
5747	0	a	Downloaded game, made character, loaded server for 10 minutes, quit.  checked online for solutions, ran repair on files, downloaded something, tried again  loaded server for 5 minutes, uninstalled  you get one chance worthless game.
7902	0	a	It wont start up. :I Plus I saw videos and the graphics and stuff look pretty bad. I can start the game up everytime I do it doesnt work. :I
9532	1	a	Fallen Earth is pretty fun.. if you can get passed all the grinding. It's your typical MMORPG set in a post apocalyptic/fallout type of setting. This game is not pay to win, unless you want shortcuts in crafting or faster leveling.  Pros: - Crafting system - RPG style - Small and helpful community - Massive world - Variety of weapon types (Guns, Crossbows, Knives, Swords, Hammers, Etc.) - Variety of skills - Incorporates faction based quests and items - Holiday themed quests and items - Vehicles - Fast traveling - And so much more   Cons: - Combat system is a bit shabby - Leveling up is very slow - Hordes of monster everywhere you turn outside of the towns  Now i haven't played since October 2014, so i'll come back and update this review if neccassary.
4237	0	a	Kicked from server for just driving around and checking out the game. So, I can't realy give a proper review, however my feeling is that the game is somewhat hostile and immature.... lol.
7181	0	a	Can be a very fun game. I was a criminal (obiously who downloads a game like this to be a cop). The game was amasing before they made it a pay to win with alot of hackers everywhere. All the guns bought with ingame currency are crap compaired to the guns bought with real money.  I also noticed from day 1 that for some reason the turning in cars is very delayed, at first i thought it was my computer as i was playing on a acer aspire laptop. Got a $1600 gaming pc that i built myself, turning still as delayed as before.   It can be fun with friends or alone, but the cops dont really do anything. My brother and I saved up together so i could buy a van. Thought we would have alot of fun robbing store fronts and running from the cops. Finaly got the van. Do alot of robberys. Got bored. Do a robbery litteraly infront of a cop. He just sits there watching us fill the van with TVs and safes and does nothing. Finaly got a cop to chase me. He drives straight into a wall when i turn because he for some reason cant turn.  Its a good game but its not worth the time you have to put into it for it to be fun. You have to try it out for your self and see if you like it. If your looking for a Grand Theft Auto or Saints Row feeling game this is not it.
507	1	a	Very cool game :D
988	1	a	THIS GAME IS A â¥â¥â¥â¥ING CANCER CONNECTING TO SERVER AND NEVER WORKS AFTER I SPENT 7500 HOURS ON IT AND PAID ALL MY SHEKELS AND IT'S NOT EVEN GIVING ME LOVE BACK.  but damn this game got cool backpacks.
9137	0	a	Don't download unless you are willing to wait hours upon hours dowloaing it. Then waiting more hours downloading an update when you want to play.
5074	0	a	Used to love this game. But the hackers now make the game unplayable.
9351	0	a	It wouldn't let me play soooo good luck?
9116	1	a	well... this game is not as bad as it seems to be. and certainly this is not the worst free 2 play game you've ever faced
5090	0	a	This game used to be alright. Had a laugh playing with my friends after being new to Steam, only resorting to free-to-play games. Tried coming back to this after being bored and see what has changed, and well it is just utter wank. Too many problems to even be called a game anymore.   I'd rather watch myself get eaten alive by a rhinoceros which is getting it's â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ed out of it by the largest sperm whale on the planet, because this game is just that awful.   If you don't have any money or you're a cheap â¥â¥â¥ who don't like paying for games but want to â¥â¥â¥â¥ about with your friends, then I kind of recommened this game. But if you got the money to buy any game, literally anything else, then dont even waste your time with installing this â¥â¥â¥â¥. The best part about this for me would be uninstalling this â¥â¥â¥â¥tard of what you call a game off my system saving me the storage space with something remotely more playable.
289	1	a	( Í¡Â° ÍÊ Í¡Â°)
8622	0	a	IT IS CRAP 
740	1	a	Go ahead and play this game.  You will soon find out why players that only spend 40 hours on the game like it and why the players that have logged over 800 hours hate it.      Note: This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing awesome; It has so much potential- It just has the world's â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥iest Dev's I have ever seen.
3186	1	a	This game is legit! i've had so much fun playing it! and its addicting to play 
4955	0	a	Worse game ever, they don't even give me a chance to learn the tutorial, got knocked out trice at spaw point, worse worse worse I hate this
10018	0	a	i started the game up about... 2 years(?) ago and it automatically set to 800x600 resolution on my 16:10 monitor. Also craftable horses and clunky UI. graphics are a bit... 1990s. lighting makes the game look blurry.
5631	0	a	An extremely budget free-to-play open world game, immitating Grand Theft Auto across all areas of gameplay and experience. It is also multiplayer only.
5105	0	a	As fun as the multiplayer is, if you have computer with anybit less than minimum, you will have nightmares of lag and latency. this game is far more taxing to a computer than anyone would expect.
6177	0	a	This game is so â¥â¥â¥â¥
4874	0	a	Welp I guess i should explain a little of my history with this game, I was a beta tester for apb reloaded (not the original) the game at the time looked great and had the potential to be better then or equal to GTA. I played this game for a very long time with a friend, until for some reason we both quit the game. I didn't remember why we left, It was vague but I felt sick just thinking about the game. 3 years later I felt like going down memory lane to see if the game is still kicking. I got my friend back into trying it again. And once I press the play button, it all started to comeback to me like a fever dream. With a slap to the face the game reminded me why this game was terrible. After 3 years its still the most unbalanced, exploitive, laggy, and grief filled game I remember. Seeing that the loading screens with the dial-up sound effects are still in the game makes me vomit.   Maybe I should go over what I loved about this game before kicking it in the balls with fury of a thousand suns.   Pros: Customization- This is probably the best level of customization I've ever seen in games, even AAA games fail to bring this level of control to how I want my character to look. Its a pretty simple system and I'm surpised not many games do it. Theres custom cloths, cars, themes, and etc. It really is where I use to waste alot of my time in the game.  Match Making- This is gray area for me because I both hate and like the match making. In apb you choose to have a death match(fight club), or go into the districts to have some random match making as you drive around when your ready. I spent most of my time in districts because that much more familiar to me then fight club. Drive around with a friend then randomly a call goes out to steal some stuff or defend some stuff or keep some stuff ( Mainly a crim by the way). Its exciting to be thrown into a match, but its bad when its far away or when its already being taken.   Now that I'm done taking about what I like about the game, lets go over why I left this game.  Cons:   LAGGY- Even during launch this game wasn't this laggy, I tried looking into why this is. Apparently they've been getting ddos attacked for a while. How many times? I don't know but enough to keep lag constant in this game.  Punkbuster- I've been gone a very long time, but I'm sure that punkbuster security still sucks right.   Cars- Car are still feel like crap on the road, I maybe able to tolerate the cars in this game. That does not mean I like them in anyway.  Guns- Some people tried to convince me that this game isn't p2w, but when I saw my friend go from 2 or 4 kills to 8 or 11 a game with just using a code for a weapon from the market place. I gonna say thats bs, the premium weapons have less recoil, some have more damage, mods, etc. And if you get to rockets ro gernade launchers say goodbye to balance because they are crazy.  Character modifications- Clotting agent is the only one you need, kevlar is worthless and makes you slow.   Districts: After all this time still only 2 districts waterfront and financial, all with no real changes or improvements. nothing about these areas are interesting and I feel like I know these place backward and forward.   This game could of been good, but its still what I remember a piece of crap I played before. ( And yes I know about the engine upgrade, I'll try it again when It drops, then be mad at myself later).       
5370	0	a	no, DON'T! Please don't waste your time playing this game. This game is crap, not much people in servers and lots of servers have hackers or annoying players. Gameplay used to be fun and this game had good potential. Not anymore. This game is horrible. Don't spend a cent on their crappy DLC too!

3048	1	a	Great game
7463	0	a	Not great in my personal opinion. Hard to drive and when I went on I couldn't find anyone else. It's free, but there isn't any other reason than that why I would play this. And consequently, I dont.

9805	0	a	A poorly made, terribly designed and boring game is here! DO NOT GET THIS GAME! It's boring is so laggy! Has so many bugs minor problems , terrible voice acting and the worst story! HOW DID THIS EVEN GET ON STEAM! Please do not waste your computer space , time and even money on The package!
1184	1	a	CANT WAIT TO PLAY OMGGGGGGGG
2607	1	a	Great Game with the best Customization I've ever seen . But you also need a lot of money to get everything you want. And its also kinda pay2win .... Theres many more which could be improved .
6749	0	a	I have dep problem.game not work
7202	0	a	Hackers + P2Ws + A pile of feces being better compared to the community  = APB Reloaded

2613	1	a	very good concept but lags all the time!
4797	0	a	this game is really fun and all but it is a pane in the butt because when you try to run it it going to scew up so no i don't recemend it
165	1	a	Since its been a while i played this game i decided to give it a look again when fairfight got released. I found the game more enjoyable since the amount of cheaters had been halved meaning less bs like that, sadly there was no real new things to the game except the R255 what i was done with quite quickly. So for a f2p its actually a good game where you can put plenty of time into and have fun in with friends but i would not recommend buying things like weapons on the armas marketplace since you are just wasting your money, altough premium is a good thing to buy.   I will give this game a 6,5/10 so Yes i would recommend it
9290	1	a	Good game, definetly worth the price of nothing.
4485	0	a	dont get it it yhas to downlaod punkbuster which nrver downloades
2377	1	a	The best Online game in the free for all class !!!!! its hours of fun :D !
1757	1	a	Pretty fun..more like GTA. Play a cop or a crimminal in teams with objectives. The only downside to this game is that its Free to Play and the players have made the game 'unplayable'. Way to much cheating and just rude players. Not worth it, but it was fun for a few minutes.
4503	0	a	I would recommend you don't start playing this game in the first place. It has so many issues that never get resolved. They release the same thing over and over. Unfortunately I made the mistake and started playing it 3 years ago, now I am hooked. It's like an abusive relationship, you get tired of it and leave for a little bit, but end up coming back for more.
1521	1	a	First impression of the game was great. However, as I progressed, and looked around, did research... I discovered that the game is indeed pay to win, with an over priced cash shop to boot.  That aside, Strong weapons don't give you skill. You can outplay a cash weapon, but God help you if you have an aimbotter with one. Yes, this game is full of hackers. Hell, today I was up against someone named 'NxT' Who has horrible, horrible aim just two days ago. Now suddenly, they have near perfect aim, no matter where you go, where you juke, where you jump, it hits. This isn't a rare case, a lot of people hack, and the community denies it, along with denying claims of pay to win. Side note, yesterday I saw someone running on foot, faster than any car in the game. Aimbot: Check. Speed hacks: Check.  NOW. If you can put those aside, it's actually an extremely fun game, it's fun to jsut â¥â¥â¥â¥ around, make decals to sell, cruise around and 'accidentally' hit someone that's clearly in a mission, ruining what he's doing. If you're the type to be able to find fun as a free player that can enjoy his time, working around hackers and going on a grind for other weapons, then I will recommend this game.  If you're the type to really care about a fair fight (We'll get to Fair Fight after this bit) then I cannot recommend this game. You will find a lot of hackers and cashers that think they're super cool to have stats that you can only get by paying $40 bucks for one weapon.  Onto Fair Fight, APB's pride and joy of an anti cheat system. Yeah, it's complete trash. They have an over priced cash shop, and don't spring for real anti cheating. I'm being completely honest when I say that 1 out of 10 hackers are banned, and the one ban is still very rare.  TLDR? Recommended if you're not a tryhard.  I myself enjoy the game, being a free player that plans to not spend a dime on the game, so this review ends in recommended simply due to my own enjoyment.
4344	0	a	Slightly enjoyable when playing with a group of friends... not a stellar recommendation but it is words put together to form a quasi-sentence.
10628	0	a	Neck yourself.....
58	1	a	Great game idea but gamersfirst doesnt care that much about the players, they should be called gamerslast moneyfirst but still like the gameplay!
8901	1	a	Post Appocalypt Earth caused by Nuclear, Biological, Chemical, and Zombies. being the first MMO I actually Liked, going into towns and helping peopled was a realy sattisfying experience. But then I ran into delema's with the main story where you are not a single man army. This game will probably be more fun if you work in packs or join a guild, Also, this game isn't free if you, it's just got a free mode that used to be sweet. It still is sweet, but a sometime after the release of the free edition, they removed the ability to have craft ques for free players.
8649	0	a	  Opinion/other stuff
3621	1	a	you will enjoy the game as long as u dont spend real money on it like an idiot so yah spend money on it it sucks but if you dont you will enjoy it
2581	1	a	This game is amazing in every way. I recommend it because it is one of the best shooters out there, lets you customize anything you really want to: Cars, Character, Clothes Etc. If you're into the CoD series, you just might like this game although its not really like CoD, it's fast paced battles with Enforcers, (Cops) Versus Criminals. This game is not, however P2W(PaytoWin), but if you do play it P2W you might have an advantage over other players. This game has been INFESTED with hackers lately, I would not reccomend it Atm(At the moment).  I currently have an R229 Criminal on Colby(NA WEST) The name is SeemsLegitBro
7162	0	a	why my game dont work at all      complaine to steam 
9884	1	a	Great game lots of fun, Although somepeople pay2win, It's a lot funner too play through without paying a thing. Great crafting system, Great combat. Overall 10/10. :)
8479	0	a	DON'T GIVE YOUR MONEY TO THESE â¥â¥â¥â¥ERS  played this without spending a dime and even then the gameplay was sub-par with most third person free roam games... yeah it's free but the UI is crap and the lag is unjustifiable for a game without demanding graphics... not to mention the kind of ping type lag i was getting into servers when i have decent internet.   apart from this there have been numerous stories of people spending hundreds of dollars only to have their accounts shut down out of the blue losing all their money.   Good luck trying to appeal that ban with such a horrible customer support service.   0/10 don't do it.
1466	1	a	A bad MMO and a bad third person shooter, with amazing customization. Bareable for a little while and fun for even less, but is a decent waste of your time; especially while listening to a podcast.
2741	1	a	this game reminds me of saints row 2 the best one 8/10
2671	1	a	Fun game to many pocket warriors
4686	0	a	- Pay to Win - Matchmaking Unfair - VAC Suck - A lot of hackers - Never Update - Old Events

4946	0	a	Lagging Servers / crashing lobbys / payed weapons are much better then regular ones / ridiculous pricing! (one weapon lifetime 60 bucks lol) alsmost forgot something.. i wrote them ones.. they never replied. â¥â¥â¥â¥ you GamerFist
9136	0	a	Isnt as good as it looks.
9297	0	a	clunky, horrible anmations, gameplay is slow, drawn out, and hitboxes are broken with little to no appropriate sound effects.
4318	0	a	I didn't like this game. I feel like the missions were just team deathmatch over and over and over again.
3613	1	a	Didnt even get to play. I downloaded a 4GB launcher, just to wait 20 minutes and never get to play. 10/10 IGN.                Serious note: This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥.
4519	0	a	TZhis game Sucks Full off kids and unskilled players-Hackers Waste of time Downloading it ppl
5754	0	a	i wouldn't recommend this game to anyone, infact me and my fiancee are furious with this game. 2/3 years ago, i use to play alot and loved it. but sadly to say duty called and left for basic, and now time has passed, i am overseas and have time to kill and downloaded this game and was not able to get on. i talk to an admin and they were very rude, and straight up said they due not to lift the supposed perm ban they have on me for no reason. they said my account violated there rules and would not tell me how. i never talk in chat and spent all my time doing missions, and most of it was trying to build a dream car. sadly to say game also rob me of my money. i paid for premium for 1 month which i know i wont get that back, but i also spent money on a vehicle and will most likely not see that too, and that's what has us furious. i was a valued customer to them and actually put some money in, and some how i violated there rules? seeing other people comments left here shows i was not the only one who is having these issues.   please do yourself the favor and just find another game. they will rob you of your money and time and effort into the game and then most likely ban you for some reason they decide whether you did it or not. seems like a scam to get you to make another account to make people come back, they only ban your account and not ip. seems odd but yeah. Switching to grand theft auto 5 was the best decision ever. but if anyone has any games that allows me to build trucks and customize them. please let me know!  and again, don't download the game save your time!

6841	0	a	Well, I was in the game and it kept freezing while I was at the title screen.   And it froze forever...   Until i load it up again, then it freezes again.
390	1	a	It is very good game, but I don't like the method called 'PAY TO WIN' in it. The game is similar to the game series 'Grand Theft Auto' however apb is multiplayer and Free to Play Game. I really want you to try this game out. This game is taking a lot of time from you, because'When you get into the city there will be not way back!'
8674	0	a	Needs Admin every time, very suspicious     4/10
6451	0	a	plays like a cheap GTA ripoff mixed with the BRINK chatacter modelling.  dont get irritated by the good looking videos,the graphics are old, the controls of the cars are terrible, it feels like the car is always drifting, the animations are bad, the sounds are also bad.  the music is good, also you can do a lot of cusomization.. all together a free hipster kid game thats trying too hard.
765	1	a	Good game is good. Good game is free. You have no reason to not download it.
1873	1	a	APB: Reloaded has one of the coolest premises ever. Cops and Crooks, simple right? It is.  OVERVIEW  The game takes place inb San Paro, a city with crime unparalel to anything else. So much so that the City Security Act (CSA) was passed. Allowing any citizen to walk the streets with a liscense to practice Vigilantism.    When you start the game you make your biggest decision, Do I want to be a good guy or a bad guy? Once you make your decision, you get to make a character with a very good, high detailed creator.   STARTING OUT   Once your character is situated, you're basically set free, the tutorial system is very poor. In the city you'll simply be dispatched to start or stop crimes. The game usually does a great job to match you with even teams.  CUSTOMIZATION   The game does although have great customization. Most clothes in the game are relatively cheap, so if you have the time, you can have an awesome character. Same with vehicles, customization is a big deal in this game.   The game allows you to create custom symbols as well. To paste onto your clothes and cars.  COMABT  There's lots of variables in combat. Combat can either be very fast and fun. or slow and boring. It all depends on the players, and enviroment.   The game kinda influences camping, with lots of defense objectives simply being, guard this choke point on this conveinient rooftop.  DRIVING   Ugh, driving is a mess. There's always a delay, you'll press 'd' to steer right. Then after half a second to three seconds later your character will steer the car. This cuases very awkward and slippery driving.  FINAL VERDICT   APB: Reloaded is a fun hectic expirience, especially with friends. But poor tutorials and slippery driving kind of ruin it.   ~ 7/10 Worth Trying.
5819	0	a	The game is always running and I can't even close â¥â¥â¥â¥ing close it!
10567	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game.
10083	0	a	This game needs a lot of work before it can become even close to being good.
3345	1	a	Great game, ruined by hackers. Fairfight only gets a few. =\ I still think it's a great game for other features.
1872	1	a	If you've ever wished Saints Row had more of a multiplayer focus, this game is for you. It's like the devs took everything we loved about the open world genre - the vehicles, the combat, the costumes, the weapons - and turned it into an mmo. This game is fun to play solo, but with 3 friends and a mic connection it is the closest thing to the perfect mmo you will find this decade. There is nothing more fun than driving a car with 3 of your mates hanging out the windows shooting everything that moves.  With an incredibly detailed world, fully customizable outfits and cars, a dynamic mission system, and a huge variety of weapons, this game is a PVP'ers dream come true. It's got a level of polish and attention to detail that other free to play mmo's lack.   NOTE: If you want the best latency, join the Han Server in Hong Kong. The average ping is about 120 - 150, which makes a nice change from having to connect to US servers on the other side of the world.
5898	0	a	It's weird â¥â¥â¥â¥ coz you spawn in and dont no what to do, no objectives or anything like that
8868	1	a	For SOME reason, my old and well viewed review for this game got removed and now i'll have to repost it:   OH MY GOD, how could i have played this crap for more than 170hours?   It seems like some people wanted Fallout New Vegas to be a MMORPG. And here it is. Well, one thing is for sure, it can be addictive if you like power play. It's art style is obviously some post apocaliptic stuff, wich looks not that bad itself. But seriously. this game is out since 2011 but yet it's full of gliches ,unfinnished animations and messed up or even missing sound files.That ruins the atmosphere.  But the thing that kept me playing for so long was the gameplay. First you start off with PAINTBALL GUNS AND SELF MADE SHIVES while rinding A FUKKING HORSE!. But then, you see some heavily armored guys with cool Gas-Masks and badass looking rifles, revolvers, and machetes while driving a dune buggy or a pocket bike(love em).  So.what does a power player think? 'I WANT THAT SH/T RIGHT NOW!' Then you realize how fast you can get EXP by just exploring and killing mobs wich acctaly makes really fun. (atleast at the lower levels.) Of course finnishing quests gives you WAY more exp than just killing stuff.But the thing is, most of the quests are not as repetitive as in the most MMORPGS.Well...not all of them are...let's say 50% of the quests you can get are repetitive.But that's something everybody who likes MMORPG's has to deal with.  Another thing is the crafting system.You can craft gear and equipment wich you could get from merchants and quest rewards 5-10 levels later.This includes....C@RZ!!!!!!!!!.you can craft your own ATV (wich is some sort of quad-bike) really early in game...if you do the right quest line.  The AI is....well...not that good acctualy.If an enemy detects you in it's view (wich is 360Â°...) it will follow you untill it's close enough to attack. If you run away from it it might give up the pursuit after like 8seconds.Usual stuff.  BUT it's the way they follow you....you can't hide from then.THEY CAN TELEPORT!  Example: I was in a house sniping out of a window. I shot some ugly a$$ mutant who was standing outsite and doing...well nothing.I shot him and took about 20% of his health.Then i wanted to swich to my shotgun and wait for him to get into the house so i can shoot him from upstairs.but while i was swiching weapons: GRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWR. It was RIGHT INFRONT OF MY FACE.So yeah, teleportation.This sucks.  But i must say this game got a LOAD of different enemies from Aligators to Zombies(and humans of course).Seriously a sh/t load. But sometimes....i though to myself 'why in a game like this?' Im talking about animals....NORMAL A$$ ANIMALS like bears, pumas, wild dogs, rhinos,snakes,Zebras etc. It seems like they ran out of ideas and started taking models from zoo tycoon.  ANYWAY. This game if great if you are only about the essence of a MMORPG since it's full with content and customizable player skills. If you care about visual stuff like graphics, visual gliches and overall atmosphere then....GTFO-------&gt;  I'm not sure whether to recommend this game for everybody or not. If you're someone who likes MMORPGs, then go download it.  Um...yeah...that review is way too long and like 2 people are going to read it anyway.k thx bye  (Sorry if there is any wrong grammar, english is not my native language.)
7212	0	a	i cant even play this game. i downloaded it through steam and started it up, it took me to a launcher where i had to register on a gaming site and made me redownload the game again via that site.  why cant i just play it though steam?  ill change my review once i play it...if this gets fixed of course. im not playing from the other site because my disk space is low and i dont see the point in having 2 of the same games
5498	0	a	this is a good third person shooter game if you like those kind of games  
3814	0	a	Don't bother trying out this game.  I downloaded this game and it appear to be that they had a server merge and I tried to talk to support about my account and they refuse to restore my account and now I am unable to login   Let's put this straight 'they don't give a single â¥â¥â¥â¥ about you'
7682	0	a	SO uhm, yeah. High level players versus people who literally just joined the game. so fair 
10809	1	a	This game is a lot of fun, and in my opinion, completely worth your time. If you are a fan of bullet hells, and perma-death I think you'll be a fan. It isn't as good as it used to be (with the addition of a large number of pay-to-win aspects) it is still at its core, a fun game. I recommend trying it out and sticking around to see what DECA (the new owners) will do to improve it. Also, play on your browser or with flash projector, Steam is far to laggy.
4547	0	a	This game is so pay2win u wouldn't believe it which is very sad considering the awesome customization options and decent gun-play.I really wanted to like this game but the lack of PvE means you will get your butt handed to you almost every mission you play, because of someone that spent like 100$ on this cash grab.It can be fun when playing with friends sometimes but that happens very rarely. Stay AWAY from APB Reloaded, you are better off playing Warframe,Defiance or Firefall.
6351	0	a	This game is a piece of crap, when about to start the game, it doesn't pop up. I had spented 2 f*cking hours to wait for the game to download.  2\10 -IGN
7782	0	a	Ya know...  I've played this game for a while and I've been going through the motions of the missions. I liked the concept but the lagging, other rude players, and hacking (Which I was surprised that it wasn't addressed by the Devs) then suddenly had it when I got tired of getting knocked on how bad I played. I came knowing that it was 'Pay to win' and wondered if that difference would lead to a better game now I know.
7701	0	a	it sucks
5464	0	a	Change the name to APB: Hackloaded and you're all set.  Expect to loose a lot. Expect to get bsed out of kills. Expect to get aim botted. Expect to never win a mission. Expect a toxic community prob worse than COD players.  Expect to Uninstall this hack infested game. Give you computer a condem before you let it experiance this infested monstrosity.
1892	1	a	Enjoy a little mayhem every once in a while? This is the game for you then... watch out for the piggies though.
2388	1	a	Yes, i have a lot of fun playing this game. Should be better with friends but i didnt play with any.
10001	1	a	My Game is Stuck on Collating Data doesnt want to go past 3% . Anyone help me out with the problem?
7331	0	a	How do you play a game so rife with hackers and no regulatory system with regards to it? That negative point is enought to drown out almost all the positiveness in the game.
7859	0	a	It's so good it's bad
9402	1	a	&gt;1st launch, gets in the game  &gt;Customize the character  &gt;Trying to move but I can't, noticed that the controls were distributed really weirdly  &gt;Got into the first bit of combat, couldn't kill the enemies because one of them were immortal for some reason  &gt;Died  &gt;Respawned, killed the first few enemies  &gt;Got out of the starting area  &gt;Looked over the hill on the left, tons of enemies were spawning  &gt;Went over killed a few  &gt;Others came too, murderfest started  &gt;Got killed  &gt;Respawned, got stuck  &gt;Finally got back onto the surface, got a random horse  &gt;Spawned the horse and went riding it  &gt;Found some interesting stuff and got off to check  &gt;Enemies started coming and I couldn't get back on the horse to escape(bugged)  &gt;Didn't have the gear to kill them  &gt;Got killed again  &gt;Started going on foot into a distant land, nothing appeared  &gt;Got killed again by some kind of buggy teleporting dogs in combat  &gt;Never played again  11/10 would do combat again  Seriously, this game would be really good if the devs would actually care about it I want to give a yes and a no recommendation at once, too bad I can't so I'll give a yes.
1852	1	a	Cool concept. â¥â¥â¥â¥ dick game. One of the worst allowed on steam.
5850	0	a	Its just not fun for poor people. If you\'re rich af, try this, but people who dont want to spend much beware of this game. It will try to suck you dry of your money, because anything good in this game requires real money.
3716	1	a	For every good there is something bad in this game.  [+] The customization is amazing. This game is not pay to win. Events occur fairly often.  [-] THERE IS A VERY STEEP LEARNING CURVE. The team behind this game almost always fails to deliver on their promises. We haven't seen a big update in over a year. Progression takes a long time. Dying player base.   Somehow, I constantly find myself coming back to play APB.
819	1	a	Best game ever, most fun and addicted game i have ever played, it would be much better if there werent so many bugs, but defiantly worth playing.
7794	0	a	Imagine a game like GTA, but the graphics are about on par with Saints Row2. the Character customization is awesome, the vehicles drive like . . . like . . . like a pat of butter on a hot skillet. I don't know if that gets the idea across. The controls are hell. Sure, the combat holds up, but you are only going to be playing with 3 other people. there are no OTHER criminals in the city, there are no OTHER cops in the city . . . it's just you and who ever is logged on playing cops and robbers VERY intermittently. The game sounded really cool in concept but they FAIL to deliver. This is the multiplayer side of a poorly crafted game with no single player activity in a lifeless city full of cowardly ragdolls. I never figured out how to open a door without kicking it open. But I must say, props on the character customization; we know where the money went.
626	1	a	Been playing this game for over 2 years. Yes like every game this game has flaws, and YES we complain about it everyday, but its sooooo addicting that it makes us come back the next day. It has both action and social features, the game has one of the best desigining features in the history of games, i would prefer it if ur a artist too and I would really recommend this game for open world game players, plus its really close to GTA multiplayer... Better actually :)
7427	0	a	I went into the game thinking most reviews and some posts about hackers, mass aim-bots and how crappy the game play was just irate people who are simply getting beaten badly as is normal on games that require some eye-hand skill.  Well I was wrong, the game is awash is aim-bots and script kiddies and the game has little to no security to even attemtpt to handle them so yo ucan be runnign down the street bunny hopping and get snipped in the head from 3 blocks away by someone you could never see.  So how the community is even worse then the CoD and Modern Warfare Xbox screachers, there most of the time you just find one or two that might be irritating but in this game, almost everyone is goign to be attacking you or think they are some internet 'gangsta' and have the same IQ as roadkill.
4524	0	a	THE GAME IS OK,BUT I PERSONALLY DONT RECOMMEND APB RELOADED
5649	0	a	Unless G1 fixes the matchmaking, new players should probaly stay away from this game, The matchmaking is terrible, Having to play against Rank 255 when im rank 87 is not fun at all, Threat does not matter at ALL in this game, You can still be a Silver Rank 255 and drop into a bronze district and just destroy all the new players, I dont know WHY people do it, but its not fun for new players or amateur players.
3308	1	a	Cant wait to try it out but it keeps saying i did the download wrong
9102	0	a	The Trailer video is a lie. The graphics sucks.
4147	0	a	Pros: -Imagine the dream of the original GTA creator. Think about how revolutionary this game could have been. -Customizable vehicles, clothes and character (to an extent due to microtransactions business model).  Cons: -Play with the unfinished product of the original GTA creator, which really is the messy afterbirth resulting from the mismanagement of over $100 million dollars by the original game developers. Now deal with the Gamersfirst company that bought APB after the game's first official launch and subsequent bankruptcy of the original developer Realtime Worlds. -'Pay 2 Win.' Access to best weapons and vehicles limited. Gamersfirst is milking the game before it dies. -The game is dead. Only a few hundred people playing it compared to the thousands before. -'Progression 2 Win.' Access to best weapons and vehicles limited. Requires lots of character level grinding. -Poorly optimized. Requires a high performance computer to run subpar graphics. -Boring and poorly designed missions. Perform boring and menial tasks that are not attached to any real storyline. Experienced players (with or without Pay 2 Win items) will exploit the poorly designed missions and maps to win. -Ugly and lifeless city. NPCs don't do anything except walk around and yell during gunfire. They will occassionally glitch or disappear. The maps do not have enough detail and it feels like you're wandering through a ghost town. For a game about 'cops and robbers,' it makes you question the storyline and motivations of each side when the city and NPCs are lifeless like this. -rampant hacking issues since beta release 4-5 years ago.  Overall: 3/10 -Terrible. APB is still a broken game after 4-5 years after the first release. It was better during the Realtime World's beta, but somehow Gamersfirst made it worse. You may be curious and excited about the features shown in the trailers during the first hour of play, but APB Reloaded and Gamersfirst will suck your soul. IT WILL SUCK YOUR SOUUUUUUUULLLLLLLLLLLLL...  
10416	1	a	this game is so addicting
2508	1	a	it is awesome i mean you can be a cop or a bad guy you would never stop playing it because it has guns on each freaking side lke hloy hell. thank you for reading my review :D
5862	0	a	it is mokney butt
2626	1	a	Having logged nearly one-thousand hours into APB:Reloaded, during the many updates, I can confidently say: This game has me forever. APB:Reloaded caters quite well (Thanks to the more recent updates) to new players, but still has a fair learning curve, and rewards the more hardcore gamers like myself.  APB:Reloaded hosts two Factions: Enforcers and Criminals. Whichever faction you choose, you're signing yourself up for the most brutal Cops vs Robbers shooter you've ever played.  Just like with any shooter, no matter how meshed it is with Online play, the tedious dying and respawning will sink its teeth into any gamer and steer them to the point of aggravation. Team up with friends or acquaintances, however, and you'll be the one enjoying the sweet taste of Raging Gamers.  APB:Reloaded incorporates teamwork as well as common sense and intense strategy. Playing against opposition, you need to spend your time wisely; rushing straight for an objective is the best way to feed the opposition kills and points. That being said, retreating to cover behind a vehicle after snagging a briefcase, you had better pray said vehicle doesn't explode if it takes too much damage.  All this reviewing, and I haven't gone over the character, vehicle and weapon customization yet. Needless to say, the vast majority of options given to you, the player, is quite overwhelming and will keep you playing for hours.  All aspects considered, I'm giving APB:Reloaded 8/10. There is room for some improvement, but that will not stop me from playing.
8326	0	a	God, where to start....  First off, the idea of this game is beautiful, cops vs criminals in a sprawling city based area? Absolutely amazing. However, when I played this game, back maybe about a year ago, you'd see plenty of new players, you know bronze peeps. But now, it's like, everyone is paying to win very hard, and are either golds or silvers, and you very rearely see bronze peope anymore. If you wash away the p2w paint plastered over this game, and just think about it's concept, you can see that the game is well thought out, and even properly executed, but poorly maintained. I don't mean in the sense of bugs or glitches, but losing just about every single mission with matchmaking like, 2 silvers vs 2 golds. It's unbearable, but I keep coming back for the concept of this game, there is nothing quite like this game, I love rollin through town on my customized Dolton, with absolutely no upgrades, and I still enjoy the game from time to time. Honestly, the game is fine, but the devs can't stick this pay to win stuff on just about every single thing in this game.  No new player should have access to equipment vet players have. This game is fun, if you like CopsVsRobbers, then try it out. And appreciate the games concept, and not the playability.
3625	1	a	An amazing game that that i wish i could play all the time but the lack of admins and increase of hackers kinda killed it for me. but other then that the game is amazing awsome costum every thing and tons of hrs of fun
3781	0	a	Wow, I cannot begin to fathom how a game with such a great concept can get it so wrong in every way. Who doesn't want to be on either side of the law, battling the other side in a fast paced action game? No matter how hard you try to like this game, it will push you back with poor performance, game breaking bugs, repetitive and uninteresting missions and extremely unbalanced matches. If you are not planning to put money into this game, do not bother wasting your Hard Drive space and time with this game. This is the most pay2win game I have seen in a long time. And, speaking of money, the prices of the items are insane, with $5 getting you 400GC. If you want to buy a vehicle to keep, while on special, it is 3000GC. Think about that.  This game is probably one of the worst executed games I have ever seen. If you are prepared to fork out a fair sum of money, and put up with laggy servers and a plentiful amount of hackers, your crazy. If you still proceed to download and play this game, you must enjoy self-harm.  Avoid this game AT ALL COSTS
9109	1	a	pretty good i rate it a 7.6/10
3690	1	a	this game is the best
550	1	a	5 years ago, and still love it

722	1	a	no one cares just play the game.
738	1	a	i really like this game
1089	1	a	This game can get you raged as all hell, and yet once your hooked you'll keep coming back..  If you find the good side of the community, make a few friends, and get built up a little bit you'll love it.
9329	0	a	This game... This game is one of those game that you enjoy uninstalling more then playing the actual game and that is because of various reasons: 1. The game is no longer supported. 2. The game is very buggy and glitchy. 3. Only fun when getting really far through it. 4. Crashing non stop. 5. Srsly why am i keeping reviewing it like few years after it got out, we all know it sucks.
715	1	a	i rate this game john cena out of 10. this game is like bilcosby its cute for one night and then next thing you know you get â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and loose all the money you own and your viginity
4588	0	a	Greetings,  Here we find the explanation of development and how it's supposed to and not-to work. Here we see a great concept, but the game's amongst one of the poorest methods of executions. It's been floating around for about 6-years, it's dissapeared and re-appeared, regardless; not much has changed on it. It's free-to-play, so if you wish to give it a try, go ahead. It's a fun game with friends, sadly it looks too much like a money-grabbin' development team but no clue do I have. Either way, recently as of 2016 mentions of new directions &amp; paths for this game to embark have been set, but this promise has been made many times (2011-2016) through many formerly responsible people of APB's development, administration &amp; moderation team. But let's hope it takes the right way into further growth.  Kindest regards, Nick.
3772	0	a	I have played this game and witnessed its decline since Realtime World's Key to the City event. The game was, and still is, full of potential that is intentionally not being maximized by a lackluster, underexperienced dev team that is simply greedy.  The mechanics function purely to benefit the only few solid loadouts in the game, no matter how you play you will be forced to use certain loadouts if you wish to compete with other players of high skill. (I'd really enjoy seeing any of the majority of the community utilize something like an OSCAR vs a Joker, which does its job better 10fold, provided both players are excellent at the game.)  The community is full of vile â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. Since APB's release, if you stream you can expect this to happen in this order. Stream &gt; Streamsniped &gt; DDoSed &gt; If you react, enjoy being stalked no matter where you go. The game hosts not only unscrupulous individuals, but also developers. Developers that would much rather help their friends rather than do something for the benefit of the game or talk to cheaters on steam on a regular basis. In the past, I can think of Neume claiming 'cheaters are customers' and resulting in another developer quitting. I can think of two developers that said the other employees did not foster a good working environment and had questionable design decisions. I can think of the fact that support replies to all tickets with scripted replies, you will not get a serious answer and if your ticket category is deemed questionable you can be replied to with something that is completely irrelevant to your ticket. That support team fostered older devs, such as Revoemag, or Jericho, who spoke to players directly and they became biased with how they handled those players and those players recieved special treatment.  The GMs the game has have always been questionable. There are a few videos of GMs running around using things such as invisibility during player missions, GM's banning players such as Sluttles and Argan and a few others for beating their friend in the arena mode, Fightclub who were then forced to go to support, which had no reply, and the only way to actually get them proper support was for the people receiving special treatment to bombard the developers with steam and forum PMs. This has happened many times, hell Shini recieved a 3-day ban for inquiring about an ARMAS purchase he didn't recieve so they could 'investigate his account'.  To prevent myself from going on any further, ill just sum up my issues with the game. Vile community Unsupportive producers and development team Questionable design decisions and lack of any truly produced content (95% of all the content they have released was content that was stripped from RTW's version of the game.) Poorly optimized Greedy producers and development team  Hell, this could go on for hours with examples and just listing SUMMARIES of my issues. I legitimately regret every hour I spent on this game and any smart player would quit and attempt to get their money back.  
7013	0	a	-10/10 wouldnt even uninstall again

9140	1	a	I loved this game, it's just so addicting! The only problem I have withit is the ocasional lag. But besides that it's fun!

5160	0	a	full of cheaters
6320	0	a	This game is really the reason why GTA exists. There\'s so many things wrong that I can I\'ll just list them:  Cons: 1. Game is very laggy. Comment: Even with a good computer, this game runs terrible. 2. Laggy servers. Comment: I have FANTASTIC internet and I always seem to lag as if I was using cafe wifi or something. 3. Not too many players. Comment: Wouldn\'t blame people who don\'t play this. The game is quite bad. 4. Boring side content. Comments: The character design and gun design while neat doesn\'t really seem to please me. 5. A RIDICULOUS AMOUNT OF DLC! Comment: What person wants to spend over $200 on some very lame DLC. The DLC doesn\'t even help.  Pros: NONE!  Final Thoughts: If you want a good open-world,multiplayer game. Get GTA 5! You could buy every GTA game with the money you spend on the DLC. RATING: 1/10 WITH A HORSHIT STAIN STAMP! &gt;:(
3760	0	a	If you enjoy playing a game in permanent beta, this game is for you.  While I've clocked many hours (have another 1.5k+ before the steam merge), I don't think I can reccomend this game to anyone. It's just not worth investing time into for new people. Older players only play it because we got hooked early on, and most of us are nostalgic or for some reason holding onto hope for the game.   I wish this game could hit it's potential that it had even back in 2010/2011, but it's not very likely, even with the 'engine update' that's supposed to be here by the end of this year. Don't bet on that though, they also said it was supposed to release back in Q1 2014, and look where we are :). G1 has been worse than Nexon, and that's a great warning sign for anyone interested in trying this game out.   If you're still interested, despite all the negative reviews, by all means go ahead. Just remember, you were warned.
10313	1	a	fun as hell
8116	0	a	Fun Game, AWSOME Customization, sadly Pay2Win, and the community is terrible. If you buy items on the shop, for example, the clothing, if you create a new chatacter or the character you bought them on is lost then you would need to buy them again for another character, that goes for weapons and vehicles and everything else on the shop. Your wallet may need therepy, lots of therepy after trying to have fun with this game which means paying $20-$60 for one gun just for the community to call you a Pay2Win Noob. Even then to truely have fun you would need to pay for premium which costs $50 and thats only for half a year, then you gotta pay for clothing, weapons, and vehicles which compared to the F2P players is extremly unbalenced. Great game tho, but Toxic Community and the Company is powered by Greed. I mean, try it if you want, im not gonan stop you. It is 'free' after all. :3

1431	1	a	It's not perfect.
6727	0	a	When I played it, I noticed it got more to the point where it was harder to play because only the older players or more experienced players still played it. Its cool and a bit fun but it got to me when I was being matched rarely against players the same level. 5/10
2421	1	a	It's the multiplayer version of cops and robbers you've always wanted. It almost feels like it's pay to win, but it totally isn't.
6495	0	a	can be very slow and takes a while to load up.When it loads it still very unresponsive and slow.

717	1	a	#GTA online #pay-to-win #just4nasaPCs
9171	1	a	Pretty fun, especially since it's free, I haven't played it in ages but I have fond memories of roaming the lands with my friend, we did quests, got loot, pretended to be hobos living in dumpsters, untill we found an empty building and used that as a house, that was pretty fun. For a Free to Play game it's quite easy to advance without buying â¥â¥â¥â¥, infact, I got myself an ATV, full set of decent armor, 2 pistols, ammo and pleanty of weapons, I even went on raids with some friends I met through a clan. Just thinking about all this makes me feel kind of sad, sad that I haven't played it in ages, and those firends have left, never to be seen again. The gameplay is pretty grindy, but advancing and getting better gear is very rewarding and the game world is â¥â¥â¥â¥ING HUGE HOLY â¥â¥â¥â¥, I once set out on my horse, travelled the lands for abut 3 hours straight, I ended up in some huge rusty old town, I have no clue if I will ever find the town I first set out in ever again. Infact, just writing this review makes me want to go play the game again actually I think I'll do that.
1299	1	a	hi can you fix the APB reloaded it go all the way to the video and thin is go black
1355	1	a	really fun game like gta but not just simply fun and cool
7638	0	a	Coustomizations in this game are awesome... but unless you REALY REALY love dieing over and over to Rocketlaunchers and Sniper fire then you probablly wanna find another game to satisfy your Medium to short range game play. Long range dominates in this game. If you dont mind repetitive deaths and not even seeing where 1/2 of it comes from... then this games for you!   Oh BTW you dont get a sniper rifle or rocket launcher starting out... you have to work your way to them. Oh yeah, and you dont get xp unless you win against these people! so Happy gaming!
2988	1	a	I love this game,except that the noobs don't really get a chance.It needs to be less of a p2w
2937	1	a	this game was fun
8387	0	a	It's a pay 2 win 0/10  good guns 7/10 nice cars 5/10 over all 0/10  Always get matchmake against a p2w and its not cool
2177	1	a	This game is really good in my opinion I havent played the game properly you know but its still a realy good game and very fun. very customizable.
10790	1	a	Amazing game, i really like the 8-bit graphics and gameplay. In my opinion this game is pretty hard. I reccomend this game A LOT

8346	0	a	Maybe, just maybe I might've shelled out a few dollars for APBR. You know, so I would actually have fun, instead of getting constantly merked with the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ starting gear the games gives you. 'Why not? People are killing me in three â¥â¥â¥â¥ing shots', I said.     To make a long story short, If I'm gonna pay $40 for in game weapons, I had better get 40 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing guns, not 1.

4976	0	a	This is a bunch of P2W trash.  Pros : The concept. Wide variety of guns, Clothing, And accessories. Able to make your own gopnik, blin. Who doesn't want that?  Cons : Everything else.  All in all, This game is a piece of trash, That I had very high expectations for, From what one of my friends told me. Big mistake, My friend. Big mistake.
10063	1	a	Great game! EXCELLENT for role play and has the largest role play community Ive seen in ANY game. It's a huge open sandbox with endless quests and the most wonderful crafting system Ive ever experienced. Only issue maybe is end game play. There are no 'dungeon like' instances such as WoW has. Once you max lvl and max your crafting all thats really left is role play. I guess thats fine for role players lol! Anyway, its well worth playing. The only difference between P2P and F2P is crafting/harvesting/gathering speed but thats a pretty big difference considering how important crafting is in the game.
4958	0	a	Pay to win garbage.

8457	0	a	I played this a while ago and I can't really remember it so it was probably not that good
3462	1	a	DO...NOT...EVEN...TRY. 3.5/10! This game may be free, but I PROMISE you, that you will end up uninstalling it.  I played it for a few hours, before I realized how bad the servers are. Constant lag, coupled with a rare form of 'repetitive first-person-shooter' gameplay... I give this game a 3.5/10
8770	0	a	Spent 40 dollars on this game. Finally hit rank 197 so I can use everything. I was banned 3 days later. For no stated reason. Wrote them a ticket and still no response. Stay away from this game and this company.

1257	1	a	this is one awesome game
10644	1	a	I thoroughly enjoy playing Realm of the Mad God. Gameplay is crazy and fast paced and I love the 8-bit graphics! The only downsides are that it's a little 'play to win' and lag spikes might cause your character to die - and dying is permanent here.
1818	1	a	Combine Grand Theft Auto and Saints Row 3 add some MMORPG and free to play marketing system and you have this.
271	1	a	This is a F2P game that has withstood the test of time for me. Unparalleled shooter action as far as I'm concerned. Takes a lot of getting used to and not for the faint of heart.
518	1	a	Very good game, but owners are bad. It can be the most played game ever but G1( R.I.P.) Prepare yourself on server lags and fps drops. :)

7223	0	a	Very, VERY bad first experience. When I downloaded this game i had to wait over 4 hours to be able to join my server (EU), then when I was able to join, I was there for like 10 minutes until the server crashed... I'm probably just gonna uninstall now.
10909	1	a	love this game
7169	0	a	This game has been completely ruined by the devs.   Instead of it being Free, they should actually pay us to play this thing.  Seriously, buy GTA V if you wanna play a game like this, spare yourself the suffering.
9186	1	a	well to be honest I didnt expect much from this game but the quality isnt so bad its just needs major improvments to the Ai and I think it could be a great game to play.
4225	0	a	its pretty bad
9772	0	a	It sucks dont play it im serious just please dont its buggy as hell the control sucks and believe me the game is just horrible and boring hope nobody will play this
6701	0	a	Well, after playing this game for a short amount of time, and I know you will say you haven't played that long, but it is very poorly put together, and not enough time was put into missions. They get extremely boring and it is very difficult to gain money. The money isn't the issue though, it's the ranking system. It does take some time to get used to, and it is not confusing, although it is time consuming. The marketing is not well put together as well. Very inconvinient. The driving mechanics as well as the shooting mechanics aren't the greatest either. Driving is very delayed when you want to turn, and shooting is very inaccurate due to large crosshairs, even when you aim in. All and all, I'd give this game a 6/10, mainly because of the graphics being so good for a free to play game and the idea. GamersFirst definetly have something started. They just need to finish it..
776	1	a	This game is interesting...could do some more work on it though.The servers are really laggy.But hopefully it will get better.Keep up the good work.:)
2462	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME! this game is beautiful, you can create your own cars and characters, WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT! APB Reloaded is one of those games where 80% of people have spent alot of money buying cars and weapons which are OP, this makes the game hard to play at times because you are put up against people who can kill you with one shot. it would be cool if you could choose to verse people that are your level and have the same guns as you, so you are not getting demolished by the people who pay to win. But if you dont mind getting killed with one shot well this is the game for you! It is fun to just get your car and Drag Race your friends or Random people, and cause Havoc on the streets with you Dump Truck, speeding along the roads blowing up everything in your path. I would rate this game a 8/10 because of its massive selection of cars and weapons, and the amount of fun you can have with it!
6541	0	a	I played APB a LOT back in the day, before it ever arrived on Steam. Now I decided to get back into it to see how things are, and sadly... not good.  APB is a good game. It can be fun with other people. It can also be a rage fest at times,   Regardless, I can't recommend a game that I here crown as the King of Grind. APB has a lot of customisation, its a damn shame that a lot of that is locked behind a massive grindfest. You could pump hours into this game, and still have most of the top tier weapons locked away, or your car customisation slots mysteriously locked with no explanation given on how to unlock them.  APB is a good but heavily flawed game that is good for co-operative play in short bursts, but I can't recommend a game that forces you to grind away it.  It is also a game that is slowly dying. Most of the servers are unpopulated, with only the top grindfest players remaining. Social district tends to have the most population of anything and it is sad to see that the developers have not really done anything to APB other than your low-key fixes and balance updates. Really, there isn't anything new, and it looks like APB will slowly approach its final resting place soon..
9630	0	a	this game sucks

5777	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing garbage, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ gameplay, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ tutorial, and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game that keeps running even when you quit. 10/10 would play again
9835	1	a	I must admit, I thought I was going to HATE this game straight from the intro. So much so in fact, that I had tried it before and quit almost immediately! But with a little bit of motivation from my friend Monstar, I whent passed the horrid introduction, and was pushed into an open world environment full of adventure and intricacy!  Fallen Earth is a highly community based, adventurous, and well-balanced post-apoc MMO. If you are a fan of the Fallout series, you will most definately love Fallen Earth, as it is very similar in appearance mood. The community is very tight and helpful, boosted by the finely balanced economy and trading system. The community is also enriched by the placement of 6 factions that hold alliances as well as enemies.  The only caviot to playing fallen earth is it's lack of satisfying combat as well as it's difficulty when it comes to leveling (seriosly it takes AGES) But as long as you keep an open mind and are willing to spill quite some time into this game, I can assure you that you will have a good time. Just as long as you can get through the intro.
2291	1	a	got my account back! very happy
578	1	a	3000 hours spent over 2 years, 2 characters max rank and many reroll attempts. I won't bother you with my terrible English so let's do it pros and cons:  Pros (because there are pros... honestly) + atmospheric (urban settings even though it does feel like an old game). + Fast-paced - what I like and hate the most about this game (I'll explain you why). + Best customization system of all time. Believe me! I've spent hundred of hours in the editor. + Absolutly NOT P2W  Cons (ok! I'll go easy on G1): - Infested with cheaters. - Nothing interesting after 1K hours. - Boring clan system. - Toxic (adult yet immature) community. - Unbalanced weapons (Ntec, low yields, NHVR you name it!) But hey! Part-of-the-game excuse! Remember? - Poor customer support - my tip: don't buy anything or no less than 50â¬ to Gamersfirst. If you get scammed, banned for no reason there's a high chance that the GM who is in charge of the customer support (not even kidding) will kindly ask you to p*** off. - Poor community management: 1 GM for 4 servers (2000 players) ... why not? And don't tell me there's more than one, I wouldn't believe you.   Now pro&amp;con: +New engine's coming soon (Announced back in 2013), Overkill servers on Obeya - No developement in the meantime: APB has been released then shut down then bought then realesed again etc etc. Since 2011 there has been nothing we could consider like game developement. New guns and reskins aren't relevant, we want new cars, new game mechanics, weapon balance, realistic gameplay (shooting and car physics) and no NHVR jumpshooters Yoloyield spammers please!  That's it folks! If I should recommend it? Yes but make sure you have at least a good friend to play with you ... and something else to help keep calm.
8106	0	a	Not great in my personal opinion. Hard to drive and when I went on I couldn't find anyone else. It's free, but there isn't any other reason than that why I would play this. And consequently, I dont.

But its full of hackers, there is nowhere you can go an play where there wont be lots of hackers looking to ruin your day, they have a new anti hack that they says is getting rid of them, but as a player i can tell you i still play against hackers most matches, i cant play it anymore as the hackers just make it unplayable!  Update in 2016, So ive come back to this game and it is still in the same state. They have two antihacks and still the game is FULL of hackers, for the first time in years i redownloaded it and it is still full of them. It is clear that GamersFirst cannot solve the hacker issue and that they also dont care about it. If you put in a ticket about it they will ensure you that they are on top of it. Go into game and it is a different story. I was in a silver district and had been playing for 2 hours, 17 out of 20 matches had a hacker in it. So this game is clearly making no improvements. As much as i hate to say it, Battleye is better then the rubbish being used on APB. The only way this game will become playable is if someone else takes over from gamersfirst. Gamersfirst do not put gamers first at all, they put money first. They are making no attempt to fix this game.  DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME, IT WILL DO NOTHING BUT INCREASE YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE AND ANGER YOU!
4763	0	a	if you want to get camping police that camp at your objective, get this game  if you want to get owned by a guy that absorbs your whole magazine and insta kills you with 3 or 4 bullets, get this game  if u want to suffer failing missions because of camping policemen, get this game  4/10, too many camping pigs  all serious though i love the idea of being a criminal or a cop and doing missions while being able to customise your person or vehicles in many different ways but you will have an extremely difficult time playing, exspecially if your a criminal as you will get policemen that are like 30 or more levels above you camping at the objective and ruining your day. at random times a special weapon will appear and who ever has it when the timer runs out then they get it. normally the weapon makes them unkillable like one time where a grenade launcher spawned and while he was busy firing at the enemies infront of him i sneaked up behind him and fired a whole clip into his head before having him turning at the speed of light and blowing me to bits. when you are doing missions (mainly if your playing as a criminal) you will get to the very last objecitve and just when u reach it 3 policemen will just join the mission and pretty much make the mission impossible to complete. if this game was more balanced and didn't have people who are complete bullet sponges then i wouldn't of have uninstalled this game. overall i would recommend u get this game if you want to play as a policeman but if you want to be a law breaking criminal mastermind then u got no chance.
496	1	a	I wasn't sure what to think of this game when I first picked it up. Interesting idea, but there was/is a bit of lag at times, and a ton of cheatin' hackers. However looking past that, as soon as they patch to the new Unreal engine which will solve those issues, the games definitely a good one if you want to play a MMOFPS game. Even though the population is a bit small, the size of the maps is big enough not to feel crowded, yet small enough you don't have to travel far to find something being blown up or someone to shoot. All in all 8/10 imho.
5537	0	a	Bad game, pay to win.
3055	1	a	Graphics 5/10 Average Story and tasks 2/10 Boring... Gun Play 4/10 I seen way better. Like BF and GTA and COD. Controls 8/10 Way easy to learn. Fun 4/10 Lots of grinding.   So average!! 5/10
1665	1	a	APB Reloaded is an awesome MMO with a slick addition of adding RPG elements to the game.  The pros: There are 2 sides, Enforcers and Criminals. Both sides have their own Private Vehicle(s) which the owner could later customize and just make it look badass to say the very least. There is a wide veriety of different weapons which you will be thrilled to have once you buy them. Criminals can actually commit crimes and then get busted by the Enforcers. It's a very nicely polished game over all, so download it, it's free!  The cons: Starting out without a real tutorial is fustrating and you will be walking around the map, mugging citizens, stealing cars, and shooting everything until, of course, you will run out of ammo. One team with OP items can be enialating the other team with newbies that only have starter pistols.
4212	0	a	This game is one huge piece of greedy â¥â¥â¥â¥. All it does is steal money from you to give to some â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s working from their mom's basements making fun at everyone.  Don't in a gazillion years buy this game or anything made from these â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s.

1380	1	a	  Thanks !
8226	0	a	Played the Original, played the Reboot, played the Reboot of the Reboot, and I can honestly Recommend not to Recommend this game to anyone, not GTA, not Saint Row, not even close, has a lot of frame rate problems, campers, and spawn killers. I think Eve Online has less gankers and that is saying something.
9871	1	a	Eh its ok
8041	0	a	This game might have been better, I like the idea, I think it has potential, but the studio simply cannot deliver it in a suitable form to players. This might have been better if the weapons were more 'balanced' (in the form of not having shotguns that don't work after 12m), and the 'premium' shop is filled with reskins (of free weapons) and overpriced cosmetics.
6129	0	a	Unrealistic game. Don't even try it.

9615	0	a	This looks like a very interesting game to play, unfortunately, I don't know that for certain. Each time that I move my character the game locks up. Not just the locks but it locks up my whole computer so that I have to restart it. Fix that and I'll try it again. Until then I can't recommend this game at all.

8314	0	a	It is a pretty good game, if you dont have any other free roam games like gta, sleeping dogs, etc. But if you have one of those games, this game is crap.
10785	1	a	So far Deca Games has been nothing but accommodating and interesting. Actually making some progress into the disaster that was Kabam. And even trying to atone for them with some free gifts (which were not overpowered or lacking, btw). I have a few things to suggest, however.   1. Fix or remove the Alchemist please. It saddens me that I can't use my tarot cards to get Alchemist rolls with the Tinkerer anymore.  2. Find a way to efficiently deal with multiboxers. Either with account numbers viewable from right clicking a players name, or by just hiring some community mods.  3. The steam version of Realm doesn't scale pop-up boxes appropriately. When you are in fullscreen (And only fullscreen as far as I can tell) and you talk to the Tinkerer or go into the options menu while in the nexus it generates improperly, can be offscreen, and is sometimes impossible to close/makes certain buttons unclickable. This is quite annoying and hopefully fixable. The most annoying instance in which this occurs is right when you enter the nexus after starting the game. You get an ad for Ambrosia almost every time. If you are in full screen when that happens the pop-up 'X' button generates offscreen and makes it so that you have to restart the game. It's a small detail, but after many hours me and my friends agree it has to be one of the most annoying parts of the game, especially when you are trying to rush to that Candyland portal after the game crashes. 4. Fix game/server crashes to some extent. I'm no computer scientist, but try to find any type of fix please. Maybe set up a bug report system that feeds system information, the way microsoft does? Improve the server load capacity? I don't know, but anything would help. I hate, and I'm sure many others do as well, getting kicked in the middle of an Oryx run.  This is all I've got for now, but I'm going to do some inquiry into what my friends dislike about the game and paste it here as well.   Thanks for all you've done so far Deca Games. Keep up the good work.  I believe in you. : )
4359	0	a	After much more time on this game I can neither recommend or say no to it.   IF you're looking to just kill time and â¥â¥â¥â¥ around with friends this is for you.  If you're looking for a deep competitive f2p shooter with no p2w aspects and a long lifespan this isn't for you.  Presently APB is really not that great. There are many problems with the game and it really will make your experience terrible. First the grinding is ridicolous. It doesn't matter that you can get money as a criminal by raiding for money, or just mugging, it takes a really long time to get cash still and you run the risk of losing it all. If you're an enforcer you really can only make cash by doing missions and that's all. Premium gives you and extra 3rd Premium cash bonus and it helps a bunch. Instead of playing for 5 days to get like 150k you can only play for just 3 if you are getting top of the leaderboard each time.  Gameplay wise, it's fun. Guns all have different feelings to them and the game encourages you to use different tactics to approach situations. Teamwork is also recommended but generally be good at game strats and you can win. Sadly this game is terribly unbalanced. Guns have been getting changed constantly and some of the high end ARMAS weapons which require real money are sometimes better than the default weapons you can get by just playing and the claims about this not being true are mostly from rabid APB fans who have played the game for years and will defend anything the dev does.   Customization is fantastic and is really varied but you can't do much without premium. You get about 3 whole layers of customization for clothing and 6 for cars and that's all. With premium you get like 50 for both and it's honestly a joke. Premium isn't worth just this but the problem is if you get say a week of premium and you make this awesome looking piece of clothing, dont try to change it or fix it after that week because you wont be able to wear that piece of clothing unless you take off all the excess layers sadly. Premium is very badly done and the game has absolutely no incentives to have it other than less money grind and better customization.  Optimization is frankly AWFUL. I use a pretty medium-high end PC and I can get 60+fps on most games but this game is terrible optimization wise. I'm getting 40-50 frames and worse when big fights are happening. I'm fine with 30FPS but when it's a fast shooter like this, it's very unnatural to have framerate that constantly changes. They promised an engine change but that is unknown to when it'll be released.  Community is also legit terrible. It's full of a bunch of APB elitist who defend the game no matter what happens. Say one bad thing and you're attacked by a bunch of children who try to defend this 'perfect game' calling you a moron and to stop crying.  Frankly this game is not worth it if you want to play on and off. You won't get much from the game if you play like that as it requires constant grinding for money to get better gear, and ranking up to Rank 255 frankly is a nightmare unless you play for straight hours on end. Playing this game free is alright. It's not as bad as other games but it takes a lot of time to gain money like I said, and with a community that is toxic, bad balancing, and other issues on hand this game isn't really worth your time if you want to play just for fun.
4240	0	a	simple put! APB is broken, G1 doesnt care about the players, they will go out of there to shut ppl up the talk about all the hackers in this game. they even banned me from the steam forums and they didnt even give a ressean why. lol hell the game is now a lagy POS and full of teleport hacks now  full free to watch this video its shows what im talking about.  http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3eipeu 
5083	0	a	If you want bugs, bugs, and more bugs, and long loading times, and bugs again. By all means
8687	0	a	Well... this is a game and should not take it seriously but back to the topic I, ve been playing this game for quite some time and i would say this is an ok game. It used to be really bad but past couple of weeks they improved this game a lot and there is no P2W wep they are all reskins. most of the hackers are gone and server will get engine update soon so right now this game is good but then again if you re willing to spend money then make sure you have lots cuz this games sucks it like a bat since one reskin costs around $30.  Take it back: this game is sht
719	1	a	+  Open world sandbox (Medium areas); Drivable vehicles; Custom clothes and cars Various weapons to use;   -  Poor optimization; A few modes to play, it feels repetitive. (Youget bored quickly.); The world doesn't feel alive, the people are souless; Only 2 main maps to play and 1 to custumize your character.  Score: 6/10.
2437	1	a	While the character creator, theme song composer and the car/tattoo/clothing/logo customisation is top-notch, the lack of a true PvE venue of advancement might be a turnoff for some fans of traditional well rounded MMO experiences. If you love MMOs mainly for the PvP and competitive aspect however, then this is a really solid modern setting title that has decent replay value.  I reccomend you grab a friend before heading out on the town, it is easy to get overwhelmed quickly without some backup!
10241	1	a	great idea fun for a good while. gets repetative but what MMO dosent
923	1	a	Even though this game is Pay-To-Win which i don't normally play, it's the only Pay-To-Win game i enjoy  Pro's  - You can customize pretty much everything - Graphics are nice - Loads of things to do like missions/pvp/social/chill   Con's  - PvP Feels Unbalanced - Pay-To-Win - Toxic Players join your missions.  Overall Rating: 8.5/10
3182	1	a	Love this game. PLayed it for years.
10196	0	a	This game had some high potentail, and it started out good too. Once I progressesed through the game, I realized, the mechanics sucked, and overall it just gets worse and worse the longer you play.
2704	1	a	i wish i could play it all i get is a black screen and i can see the main menu flashing.......i think
2442	1	a	Pretty Legit
9027	1	a	This game is extremely addicting and fun, the first few hours are boring but once you get past that this game is AMAZING. Graphics are meh and the combat system is kinda bad, however the simple fact that I can go into a cave mine some coal kill giant ants and underdwellers to find a secret cavern is just awesome. And th MMO part adds so much immersion to the game, know whats more fun than attacking a bandit camp? Attacking it with a group of people. I normally stray away from games like this but I have been playing this bad boy nonstop. Also notice how most of the bad reviews complain about difficulty or buggyness or complicated gameplay yet they haven't played for more than 10 hours? They say some crap like this game is Pay2win, and its not at all, Sure paying gets you some 'new' things faster but you can get most of these things ingame anyway. If you are a realism fan then get this game. Note this game has a big learning curve and difficulty spike.  Now to the problems The enemy AI tends to be â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, Enemy's respawn in 1 minute taking away from immersion, for some reason the damage and health system is bad (No joke dogs do 20 Dmg a bite and attack every seconds or so and I've gotton surrounded by em and killed in seconds as the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ take bullets to the head) Stay away from junkyward dogs and gurad dogs is my only tip, The scavenging system can be quite stupid sometimes as well.   Over all this game has +Great gameplay mechanics +Interesting storys and characters +Great immersion +Addictive micro managing +Great trade and communication system  The middle ground Game lacks mercy for new player which can drive people away but not a problem and is more made for intense gamers, not bad but not great graphics.  Now the bad  -Terrible AI -Unhelpful NPC's -Strange level system -Fast enemy respawns  Overall I'd give this game a 8.9/10 
1860	1	a	Its like GTA with a few differences but its fun as hell... If you can get it to work
8717	0	a	Complaint: On 2015-09-09, my Gamersfirst account was permanently suspended under the accusation of 'Hacking.' I sent in multiple support tickets asking for a legitimate investigation of my account and a chance for me to entirely explain what I was doing and what I was not doing. However, all of my tickets were closed with the generic copy and paste response that their system sends out when they refuse to be a respectable company and engage in a human conversation. Before my account was suspended, I had been an active member of the community for the game APB:Reloaded and had accumulated up to $2,000 spent for services and items for that game. Not only was I denied any legitimate customer support, I was personally lied to and falsely accused of 'Cheating' by the employee ***** ******' ********** who is the current Community Manager of the game. I was told that I would be allowed to 're-roll' by making a new Gamersfirst account and 'not cheating again' after multiple attempts at getting a human response from the company, however the account I made while I was waiting for any further responses was permanently suspended as well, without any justified reason. Afterwards, ****** personally blocked communications with me over the Steam service on which I had attempted to speak to her through, and not once has responded to any of my emails sent to her company email address. I did not cheat on any of my accounts at any point in time, and this employee personally interfered with any attempts at having my suspension being properly investigated. I had invested THOUSANDS of hours into their service, and had spent TWO THOUSAND dollars to make their service more enjoyable for myself and others, and I was disgustingly treated like I wasn't worth the time to communicate with.  Desired Settlement: At this point in time, it has been over seven months since my original account was suspended and I am no longer interested in having my account restored. I would absolutely demand the chance to personally be contacted either by phone or email by anyone who is capable of providing a human, unbiased conversation on the details of my original suspension, and to explain why I was allowed to be treated the way I was by the specific employee mentioned previously. In fact, I'll even accept a formal apology that I was falsely accused of cheating, and that my suspension was because I had been searching for unreleased content via the game's main executable. If either of these outcomes occurs, I will stop wasting the time of their game moderation team by no longer creating new accounts on a daily basis just so they have to search to remove me from their game repeatedly.  Business Response:  Thank you for contacting us. This account has been permanently terminated due to our staff verifying that it was involved in illegal in-game activities. As our Terms of Use  (www.gamersfirst.com/terms)  and EULA state, this is an explicit violation and necessitates account closure. We apologize such action is necessary and understand your frustration on this matter but we do take all levels of cheating quite and had to make the regrettable decision to close an account. Thank you for taking the time to submit communication through the BBB.  Consumer Response:  Better Business Bureau:  I have reviewed the response made by the business in reference to complaint ID ********, and have determined that this proposed action would not resolve my complaint. For your reference, details of the offer I reviewed appear below.  The response I was given was no different than a copy/pasted message provided when a customer contacts their customer support personally, which provided absolutely no functionally acceptable information on which to discuss this issue, though I appreciate the incomplete sentence about 'cheating.' They say that they don't provide information about bans because it can help cheaters avoid future bans, but in reality they do it because they can screw over paying customers and not provide legitimate proof of any illegal in-game activities. I did not cheat, and had not cheated, on any of my active GamersFirst accounts until they showed their true colors and I had nothing further to lose. I appreciate the effort of the BBB in their attempt at getting a reasonable excuse from this pathetic excuse of a company. ** *** **** ***** ** * ***** ******* *** ******** **** ** *** ****** ******  Regards, ******* *******
4492	0	a	Awesome concept terrible execution - be prepared for horrendous combat and vehicle mechanics with the only consolation being the in-depth customization of both personal vehicles and player avatars.
4754	0	a	Cops 'n' Robbers... sounds great doesn't it. The concept that hearkens back to boyish childhood games. Yay!  But this... *sigh* I can't recommend, even if it is free.  Gameplay:   Yes, there is a wonderful range of customization to your player and vehicles, but dress up dolls does not make for a fun game.  The aiming controls are not precise, add that to nerfed down guns and distance shooting is always a roll of the dice unless you get right on top of your opponent and overkill... and even then you may not score.   The matching system is ridiculous. The three metal system of Bronze (noobs) Silver (noobs) &amp; Gold (usually P2W) causes countless whispered curses when paired up against a Gold opponent. Being repeatedly slaughtered is not 'fun'... except for the sadists that pay $25 for a digital super gun to do it.   Missions and Content are.... BORING. The game is built around one thing... GRINDING. It takes forever to max out the criminal boss you're pledged to, all for lackluster rewards... most of which can be obtained by criminals through smash &amp; grab looting and mugging. When on mission it's the same thing over and over... thin... VERY THIN... explanations on why you have to kill vigilantes and criminals. Simply put: It didn't make me enthused at all to be the bad guy.  More fun can be had by simply piling cars up and exploding them, and that's sad.  Where are criminal on criminal missions? Or enforcer on enforcer competitions? Hello? Massacres? The NPC pedestrians are barely treated like they exist.... why not missions with penalties and rewards for damages done to civilians? It has NO imagination. It's supposed to be blissful anarchy! Where's an evil super genius behind the scenes for some truly diabolical missions?!!!  Sound:   The gameplay aside... The sound is great.... and the soundtrack is good for discovering new unheard of bands. Too bad it doesn't have a constant rotation or a lineup of new bands to keep introducing tunes while preserving community favorites.  Community: Ahh... the community. The genuinely good humored players are overshadowed by whiners and griefers. Butt hurt noobs that whine about being killed or cheated a kill... and even more that countlessly accuse others of hacking just because they can't get over the idea that 1. The game cheats. and 2. They suck. Though hacking does happen, it's usually not the case over the general unbalanced nature of the game.  Overall: It's fun for a few hours each year, but eventually deleting the pointless maelstrom of discontent doesn't cause any feelings of loss.
8186	0	a	To many hackers
8741	0	a	Dont. Get. This. Game.  The servers are laggy, fps is out of this world, loading times are worse than skyrim, pay 2 win, banning people for cheating even though they wernt cheating. SHALL I GONE ON PUNKBUSTER? FIX YOU GOD DAMN GAME AND UNBAN ME FOR 'CHEATING'   Please just get Grand Theft Auto 5, you will have a much better 3rd person/first person experience that you will never forget.
8928	1	a	Well i played 5.3 hours but i'm already a fan. This game is nuts. I love this!!! 
3420	1	a	Worth playing, me and my friends Mike and Tristan play this all the time, a fun multiplayer shooter
10617	0	a	The Kabam is real
2901	1	a	Its a great action filled MMORPG. You can customize nearly everything in your Playermodel and your vehicles, as well as your loadout and weapons. Big fun with some friends. You'll love to run over the enemies with your cars or blow sh*t up, or just simply hunt the opposition down with all the gunpower you can get. Best thing: Its totally free ! Absolutely worth the try !
7439	0	a	Cool Graphics but it's bad game and very laggy !
4029	0	a	Customization: 11/10 Gameplay: Meh.  If you enjoy painful grind, even more versus opponents that have end-game weapons like a spam-cuz-bad nade launcher, then dive head first into it. Because yes, this puts newbies versus experienced and geared-up players.

6775	0	a	So I once had a good review of this game, but I have to change it I'm afraid.  I have well over 400 hours into the game (Played before it was on stea to track my hours) so I'm not someone coming in talking out of their â¥â¥â¥â¥ angry about pay to win.  I have spent money on this game  I have earned a lot of the same stuff outside of spending money  I have leveled both a Crim and and Enf 1 max one close to it.    This game is a shell of its former self, and really there is no game like it still, but you should still look elsewhere. I won't scream hackers, because they've gotten good at banning them, but there are still a few cases where it is far past questionable, especially from the same few people that somehow stick around (I've played long enough to know good from hackker).  I won't say the game is entirely pay to win, and this is coming from someone who HAS paid into the game, but I will say it has gotten damn close, especially the past year. New guns come out that you can only buy, their are not great earning eqvuilanets, and the few that are in some cases can take you as many hours as I have into the game, not including mods, and making the money to rent them constantly.  It isn't a terrible game, but sadly it is run buy a company that seems more focused on their shop than their game. Still the same tired maps this many years later, still the same tired missions that get old and are easily exploitable if you know them well enough (some sides WILL easily win if they are defending/attackin for example). The company running this game seems to have given up on impleneting anything new into the game outside of guns they sell you with real money, and seem to have all but given up on the idea of expanding the game or adding content, which is sad. Game STILL has potentially, simply because no one else does this really, outside of GTA 5 online, but the devs need to realize they are running a game server, not a cash shop.
5447	0	a	The game started out fun, but getting deeper into it, you begin to see the inconsistencies of what it claims to be, and what it actually is. There's no denying how awesomely customizable everything is in the game, down to character creation, outfits, vehicles, what have you. The problem I ran into, is the overwhelming number of people hacking the game, prolonging their own lives and auto-aiming. Once you put two and two together, you realize you're only one of a handful of legitimate players, competing against a troupe of people who just wanna be successful in a video game, even if it means cheating. I'd check this off your list, because there's no rescue coming.
9083	0	a	u have to go through sooo many stuff to just play it and its not even fun horible game who ever made this has no idea wat there doing
8642	0	a	The admins are clueless, the mods who are not employed with the company are ignorant, the cheaters have taken over the game, Deep Silver is ruining their game, the admins are nowhere to be seen, the only employee who appears to have any form of discussion with players is CM Tiggs, i never met her, even though when i was a GM/CM over at T3Entertainment, i heard she use to be a CM with HanbitSoft, even though I'm not sure if that was true or not. I have nothing against her personally, but she needs to do something with the forum mods and get rid of them.   Depsite the BS. I click no on recommend 'in general'&gt; But read below , because despite all the crap with this game, I'm not against anyone playing it. But listen good, DO NOT GIVE MONEY TO THIS COMPANY MONEY. Everything i mention above , they don't deserve our money until they do something about the things which i mention. And until the cons below are fixed.   NOTE: IF ANYTHING IF YOU MUST , DO GIVE MONEY FOR PREMIUM, ITS THE ONLY THING WORTH BUYING. BECAUSE WITHOUT PREMIUM THE GAME IS POINTLESS TO PLAY. But read below about that.  Pros+ Intro Music  Character Customaztion Car Customzation Music in General Feature to add your own Custom Music Driving around  OCA Whipser is very nice gun to use.  Cons- The game itself Gameplay is boring Missions are repetitive Only 2 maps They removed the old threat system which made the game run, i told them once they removed it, it will runied the game and lose players . As you can see they didn't listen to me lol.  Game popluation is very low Downgraded graphics Cheaters/Hackers Everywhere Lame Anti-cheat method Lack of GM's Firing Good GM's Fight Club Mode is lazy, which means, instead of them designing new areas for FC, they took the main 2 maps and use some of that and made that into 2 Maps. Now that wouldn't be a bad thing, if they added new areas/maps every 6 months. But its the same 2 FC Maps for what 4 years now. Very very Toxic Community, never add friends you don't know IRL, never group with anyone, never trade with anyone.  No PVE Only PVP Macro users Closet Hackers Corrupt GM's( now ) Forum is toxic due to mods not being employed with the company. Tech Mech honestly should be fired becasue of this. He's letting people who are not even employed with the company run his forum. But wait, Where is Tech Mech? Nobody has seen or heard from him in months.  Asylum after 5 years still not completed The main 2 maps are still unfinished. Very poor performance Without premium game is pointless to play  ...................................................  Bottom line: If you choose to play this game, you will get bored. Its like GTA but done in a very poor way. David Jones the Creator should be glad he left. Do not give money to this game. And oh yea, there's suppose to be a engine upgrade coming out, but the staff never listens and due to some NDA ( Which i highly doubt is in place ) they can't show anything. But wait, they already show 3 videos and 15 pictures. But now they can't show anything lol. So play this game, but never give money to them, if you must though, find alt ways to earn premium, or if you must, only buy premium and nothing else and use the market to get things you want. The market in game.   Such a great game years ago. My advice, and i strongly suggest you do this for the best alt for APB:  Saints row 3 and 4 Hellgate London (which has even more customaztion compred to APB) Sleeping Dogs Crackdown 3, which is being worked on by RTW staff and Dave Jones himself.  NOTE: I have no inteintion on fully coming back to this game until i see what the engine upgrade is going to be like. If they didn't add blue tracers back, the old threat system or 'more importanlty' HQ Bloom, I'm never coming back.

8777	0	a	TL:DR - You must be a masochist to take this game seriously.  Still a terrible shooter. Somewhat fun for the veterans, just the new pay2win guns make it hard to be enjoyable. Not to mention the hackers. There's an average of one or two per team on Fight Club, at weekends. Don't know about the action districts as I hardly play them, but it's safe to assume they are there as well. It's a game adored by hackers for some reason. G1 should legalize wallhack and everything to level the field.  Grind is less terrible than most F2P games, kinda of goes fast if you are dedicated. But it's hard to raise credits to buy anything, since the payouts for missions or the fight club are next to abysmal. Obviously there to help selling premium subscriptions/premium stuff.  To summarize, you must be a masochist to install this game and keep it, to take it seriously. Believe me, I was one of those maschists that wanted to have everything the game could offer back in 2011.   You may have one or two fun matches, then it's a neverending streak of awful matches that'll probably end up with a broken mouse or worse in a fit of rage. There isn't a friend I met in the game who doesn't have one of those nerd rage stories.
6408	0	a	HOW LONG AGO HAVE THEY RELEASE THIS FRIGGIN GAME AND THEY STILL DON'T HAVE FULL CONTROLLER SUPOORT, DAFUQ?... YCKY. WARFRAME CAME OUT AFTER THIS AND THESE GUYS STILL DON'T HAVE THEIR â¥â¥â¥â¥ TOGETHER WTF? NOT EVERYONE CAN PLAY ON A KEYBOARD... THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WITH BIG HANDS AND CONTROLLERS CAN ACCOMMODATE THIS ISSUE, WHICH MAKES PLAYING THE GAME MORE ENJOYABLE AND COMFORTABLE. PLEASE RP GET YOUR SHET TOGETHER GOD!!!! 
5022	0	a	66 minutes and I still can't get this damn game to work, screw it.
5618	0	a	No would help me. I couldnt complete missions and wasnt that good as a game.
9197	0	a	Isnt as good as it looks.
10710	1	a	Don't be fooled by 68 hours, My main account most likley has several hundred hours of gameplay. This game offers so much, but it's rather difficult to get into, while being incredibly easy to get in to. Starting the game and exploring is fun and you can do it from day one, at first glance it's a fun game, but nothing you'd spent much time on. Now If you look past that, there is actually so much. The leveling system isn't what determines a character. Maxed stats are. In game 'potions' are used as a sort of currency in the trading economy, along with gear and other items. These potions are obtained by defeating difficult enemies and completeing certain dungeons. To problem is, getting this far takes practice, detrmination and grit. Death is inevitable, dont let it set you back. Learning how to rebound from deaths becomes an integral feature as you make characters that are more and more powerful. Even the most powerful characters who have all 8 stats maxed are prone to quick deaths, the game in unforgiving, and requires skill, but offers much in return for those who deliver.
5319	0	a	the game sucks. it says i played for 1.4 hours. the 1.3 hours was spent creating profiles and installing. i thought the whole idea of steam was to centralize online games for computer gamers?  anyway, i played for 5 minuted and then deleted it.
986	1	a	apb is not pay2win, you are just bad
10354	1	a	fun for anyone wanting to have fun killing things
4350	0	a	  This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥!   This game is made to suck money from their players. The company doesn't fix things they just release more pay to win content, The game is a great idea and since its a great idea and sometimes has great matches it makes you want to play it more, But in the long run just uninstall it and leave it be and wait for a better APB.  
7492	0	a	Wow, snipers don't even show the scope, amazing.
7080	0	a	While I enjoyed playing this game initially, the micro transactions and repetitive gameplay made this game feel like a pay to win platform. The customizability of your character is top notch, but doesnât excuse the fact itâs simply not fun to play.
7353	0	a	Come here if you like customization. The gameplay will make you rage, though. The game likes to pair you up against higher levels and/or people with paid subs. Both have better weapons than you and will kill you faster.
10778	1	a	Very good, interesting and HARDCORE game!
8929	1	a	I've only put a little over an hour... but man I am HOOKED. It takes a little getting used to, but the whole idea behind it brings a new perception to MMO's. The multiple item equips is awesome (especially how it shows on your body), the skills, the mounts (You get one for free at the begininning!). It is a little glitchy here and there, and the constant changing views can get a little annoying.. but past that it is a good game to get, especially if you want to play with friends (there's a reason why it's an MMO). Get it now! It's free and definitely worth the time!
4395	0	a	sucks
9277	0	a	After waiting 26 minutes for the game to load and to create a character I got into the game, it immediatly crashed. So I reloaded. and it Immediatly crashed. So I reloaded again. And it immediatly crashed.  What I piece of garbage! No wonder its free. It doesnt work.
3402	1	a	Its free and its amazing! Download it!! 
5794	0	a	Not bad game but staff is suck. I spent a lot of money to this game and they banned me twice with no reason.
6875	0	a	Don't waste your time, people figured out how to speed hack, now you can't do anything about beating them. At least when it was just aim botting you could out smart them. Can't even boot them from your team unless they TK first. Fair Fight is a joke. Uninstalling.
2505	1	a	Although it has some faults overall I think its agreat game with alot of potential.The customization is absolutely awesome,and so is the expeience you'll have playing.Sometimes it can get laggy but not often,oh and the match making system is questionable at times. If you like GTA then this is deff for you.
7631	0	a	I am very disappointed about this game, I was told this game had genitalia and it doesn't, shameful.
7328	0	a	Truely awful. You will just die, and die, and die by simply overpowered players that have put their money into the grind machine to quickly unlock the best possible weapons that will one shot you before you can blink. No tutorial that I noticed, and no match making, just thrown into a mess. Appalling game.
10382	0	a	The only part of this game that met my expectations was the uninstall button. I didn't think all of the negative reviews could possibly be true, considering how cool the ideas sounded on paper. And then I played it. Every facet of this game could've been accomplished better in a few weeks by any other studio. I, with no experience, could've designed a better looking UI. The gunplay is utterly terrible. The graphics are severly outdated, even by 2011's standards. The community is hostile. I didn't even get far enough in to mess with the customizable vehicles. Do yourself a favor and just get Borderlands instead.
9320	1	a	I say this game is like a mixture between Fallout and Star Wars the Old republic. It looks great, definitely download it. Watch some gameplay vids 1st, it is a bit complicated if you are just starting it.
2000	1	a	I've been playing APB reloaded for about 100+hours so far its not that bad i find it quiet fun, if you arent that skilled it could be a complain on match making, im alright with this since i usually get 2k score rating im inbetween gold/silver ranking. To me its not bad at all nothing wrong with it, yes some weapons are OP in Weapon shop which could be considered Pay to win, but i found after i get upgraded stock weapons that usually comes to Tactics and which weapon is equiped but mostly on tactic it self, i killed and won over many Pay to wins.   To me try it out see how it goes dont give up so fast, you must be pretty good at games like a proper 'gamer' good with progression, people who have just started gaming or havent played much of these type of games would find this game abit challenging. How you tell your doing any good is if your getting better scores they do and over 1k score rating and going up most matches, winning.etc barely dieing. those type of things.  Give it a shot, if your good with it its never a problem with match making at all Also adding - stock weapons are pretty good, i still own golds and silvers with it, not really your weapon, tactic/dodge.etc is the aim i do, i even try crouching time to time. Also a tip you should see if they have any perks like Blood clotting and more armor on them selfs, and change your tactic towards that 1 person, usually for the more armored and slow, i usually fire abit and hit them and reload as quick as possible, then full on kill them with the means to kill them.   Also dont go to Hong Kong server as it isnt in 'hong kong' its more in USA side, also it doesnt have many people in it. so i disagree ever going that server. Give it a shot Gamer!
6159	0	a	It sucks
3484	1	a	Lets start this off by saying I have 1k+ hours in this game. This game is really not for everyone, its kind of clunky, buggy and irritating. But if you can look past that to the simple joys such as spending hours in a customizer making your character look like a true badass or pulling off amazing stunts in combat it makes it all seem worth it. A lot of this games problem is it rarely gets new players, this is because the vets who've played this game for thosands of hours drive off the newbies. People are toxic, they spew hate and slaughter newbies as a past time. It also has lots of problems with hackers as its a F2P. However it can be incredibly fun, and the people you meet are awesome. I won't say the game doesn't have problems, but if you can pass the trial by fire it opens up. We need new players badly the game can't really fix the problems it has unless we get new players. So its up to you the consumer to decide if you're tough enough to make it in san paro, you'll get your â¥â¥â¥ beat but make sure you get some good hits in and keep at it and you'll make it.
7867	0	a	This game has a lot of potential when it leaves it's alpha state, but for now, it's clunky, confusing, and unforgiving. Dong not expanded.
2465	1	a	Awesomely fun! Unlock guns cars and more! Free to play also!
6038	0	a	Whatever you're thinking of doing with your life...Searching through free games or any other kind of games...Install ANY but not this game...This game has officially been overrun by hackers, it was once a good game (2010-2013) but now it's dead to me deep inside...DONT INSTALL THIS GAME.
140	1	a	APB Reloaded is a great game, but is extremely hard at the begining. It take quite some time to get used to game mechanics, teamplay, map and so on but once you are done with it, you will never stop playing. The game has huge potencial, limitless customizaton and tons of content. Thou some of it is buyable with real money only. But fortunatly the game is SKILL BASED. What means good teamplay or good skills can beat any gun, and you have plenty of good option to utilize your gameplay as you please.
6224	0	a	You guys think this is like GTA? I got ONE answer to that. No
6375	0	a	played it for 1.3 hours, worst game i've played in a long time. It's pointlessly restrictive and boring, no play.
2557	1	a	This is a fun multiplayer third person shooter, it has a lot of customizaiton and is very addictive. If you enjoy GTA or games similar to that this is a must have, and best of all its free.
6277	0	a	TL,DR: Good concept, poor execution  APB Reloaded, what can I say.  At first, it sounded great, an open world comps vs robbers stile game, something different. Lots of customisable options including kill sounds, brilliant.  Then the play started.  It is not friendly towards new players. The tutorial system works for the first three full 'missions' then its kill the most advanced players in the game. The customisation is clunky, time consuming and the customised music requires advanced midi making knowledge.  Players on both teams seem to either hack, or have no lives (or money) as weapons are mostly pay to aquire (and then only for a limited time), or they have aimbots and kill in up to three shots (normally takes around ten).  As an added extra, after the recent update, the game likes to randomally lag and kick people out of the game, disconnecting for unknown reasons.
2002	1	a	Very fun game, lots of varied online play.  Reminds me of GTA, but with a multiplayer aspect. It does have a pay to win aspect, but to be honest the starting guns are great. The only thing worth buying is the premium pack, which gets you like double money from missions.  Really recommend this game if you're looking for some fun filed action!  
3927	0	a	A pretty terrible game, it's got a major pay-to-win System, the anti-cheat system is awful and affects other games, the company is super greedy, and the overall game is buggy.  The customization is fun and the guns are great, but not well balanced.
3729	1	a	Good game, but the engien they're using, is a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ potato..
10120	1	a	Its a great game if you have the time to play. It gets really in depth with crafting and all types of weapons and skills to find I might have to reinstall it again
7020	0	a	Game doesnt load for â¥â¥â¥â¥
9552	0	a	I like what it was trying to be, but the UI and combat is just so klunky it fails sadly.
5757	0	a	2 words, Micro Transactions. you go figure the rest out!
8764	0	a	Just dont waste your time on this game like i did.It's really addictive and incredibly â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.P2W ,lots of bugs,â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up community and devs who dont give a f. what you have to say.Since the early beta the game is the same nothing new except few guns reskins which u have to pay your real dough for.
5928	0	a	over priced and dead they arnt reviving it there just milking the rest of it dry, the pop was high then they banned all the cheaters and pop is dead. still find people using hacks and auto aims. In short over priced shop and game is dead, ive spent plenty of hours and money on it and i dont recommend you waiste your time at all.
8345	0	a	Literally the worst game.
10702	1	a	holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game has â¥â¥â¥â¥ed me over and over i hate this â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game lost 2 8/8  who cares imma just grind it again  gud geme
3834	0	a	This game has potential, but GamersFirst (lol) is clearly incapable of giving it the attention it needs to reach that potential. The game is mostly fun, but to have that fun, you have to be prepared to deal with lag/microstutters, hitreg, botters, hackers, crap server performance, exploiters, pornography (player made images), racism, sexism, threats of real world violence, and a near complete lack of GamersFirst presence on the servers. I say near-complete, because there are occasions when the staff makes an appearance, but those are extremely rare occurances.   I would love to recommend this game, but i simply cannot. I have logged almost 2000 hours into this game, and i've watched it mostly degrade in that time.  Best i can tell anyone is, STAY AWAY from this game until GamersFirst (can't even say that with a straight face) either gets the game under control, or sells it to a company that will.
5486	0	a	this game is the definition of BROKEN, BUGGY AND THE SERVERS... IF ANYONE I MEAN ANYONE calls this game remotely a GTA Clone your are out of your mind this game is a disgrace to F2P games. How can anyone take this game seriously.. The gameplay is beyond terrible, the concept is terrible I mean giving an anarchistic concept on GTA themed clone are you SERIOUS? THIS GAME IS TERRIBLE 0/10
1478	1	a	gave me adware  10/10 pay for a lot of content simulator
5154	0	a	I'd rather rip my â¥â¥â¥â¥ off and feed that â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ to a dog than play this game.
179	1	a	This game is a good one it does take some time to get better at it, but its very fun with friends
9746	0	a	this is by far the stupidest and biggest waste of time i have ever played. the original super mario has better graphics and physics than this game and its just so freakn complicated its ridiculous. dont waste ur time on this game
6528	0	a	This is worse then a pay to win. You have to pay to even have fun! Worse then freemium.
3281	1	a	this game is amazing... I was looking for a GTA substitute and this fit the bill and more. I mean GTA you cant ram things and raid it! but this game includes a lot of customization which is awesome to express what you like in VG's. but in general a good game for anyone
10150	1	a	HELL YEAH!! It's a very awesome combination of MM and FPS, the big world is amazing, the way every looks and feels around you is amazing!
4969	0	a	Pay to win through and through. Very sad, this game had a lot of potential and the customization is very good if they would've just made a base price of $30-$40 and had weapon unlocks similar to GTA this game would've been amazing. But no F2P system ruins another game.
2927	1	a	Not a bad game when your playing with friends and are looking for a laugh. Major Hacking Issues though. Store Hacked Items, Aimbots, etc.
1503	1	a	I rarely play it but it's still fun! when i started i no lifed the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of it 258 hours wasted i mean spended well.
10007	1	a	If you're still sad about the fallout MMO being canceled, this game serves as a good substitute for it.
5169	0	a	This is a bunch of P2W trash.  Pros : The concept. Wide variety of guns, Clothing, And accessories. Able to make your own gopnik, blin. Who doesn't want that?  Cons : Everything else.  All in all, This game is a piece of trash, That I had very high expectations for, From what one of my friends told me. Big mistake, My friend. Big mistake.
7538	0	a	it wont let me luanch apb i press start then it wont load
10412	1	a	i like it.theres crafting looting and alot of other kool mechanics
4076	0	a	Honestly as long as I played this game on my record none of it was me having fun because there is no balancing system which means you`re either on the team with people who Pay2Win or you`re on the losing team against the people who poured money in to there is no middle.  4/10
10468	1	a	this game is fun for a while however after you start to get far // the second map you need to pay to have a bigger poket for money and i lost lots of money due to this fact and now you need to pay to get more money making this game allmost no fun in the end.
3623	1	a	1. Multi Player .  2. Open World .  3. Action .  10/10 &lt;3 .
10910	1	a	Its good fun but at times seems as if it is pay2win.
1674	1	a	ight game. 8-10
4006	0	a	Nice game and pretty fun to play for a while, but just as any f2p,the game does have some serious issues. In the case of apb,it's the balancing of the 2 factions,enforcers and criminals (=pigs and crims). While criminals are really fun to play,enforcers get a huge advantage over them by being able to 'witness them' and pretty much 2shot them (the combat mechanics of the game are: hold down your mousebutton,the one with the better weapon or first hit will win.)  The problem here is that the notoriety system of the game lets the pigs witness any criminal with a high enough rating. This gives cops a huge combat advantage,since you can't shoot cops as crim unless they witness you and start shooting.   If you dont mind balancing and serious hacker issues,you'll have a fun time,especially when playing with some mates.
2473	1	a	It is like a mixture of GTA and Crimecraft. Except more badass!
5124	0	a	WORST GAME EVER!!!!! DO NOT PLAY! I REPEAT DO NOT PLAYYY!!!
1489	1	a	You can drive a garbage truck and destroy anything in your path. Me and my friends took 4 garbage trucks and wreacked havoc all over. 10/10
6828	0	a	A game with great potential, ruined by what only can be described as incompetent developers. This game is mechanically unbalanced and unintentionally designed to bring out the worst in people, and despite the crappy engine the game is built upon that would prevent quick changes on larger scale issues, the game still commits simple game design sins, the biggest one being selling mechanics as premium items.  This is the ONE THING YOU DONT DO IN A F2P GAME, it's the quickest way to unbalance the game beyond the developers control, and the prices in the store are beyond extortionate and exploitative. Despite the various lead developers and community managers that move in and out of the company (which really makes you wonder what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ is going on), apparently no-one collectively sees this as enough of an issue to fix.  It's sad then that it's still the MMO i've played for the most time, but to be honest im hoping now that another much more intelligent developer will make something that encapsulates the brilliance of this games concept and actually be able to make it good, as i've given up on hoping Reloaded Games recognises these elements as actual problems.
4207	0	a	One of the worst games i have ever played, do not play this,
1908	1	a	I recommend this game to a rather limited crowd, for a couple of reasons.  _Pros_  Customisation. Probably the best I've ever seen in a game, better than Saints Row, better than the Bethesda games for character customisation. You can make your character look like pretty much anyone you choose to, let alone the great symbol customiser and car customisation is brilliant. Except the lack of non-purchased car parts, GamersFirst loves the moneys.  _Cons_  Level design is attorcious, you can lock down an entire mission for an opposing team by camping in a completely unreachable spot. San Paro is plagued by badly designed, unconquerable locations, which players can move the objective too, and will make people mash their head on the keyboard, and hang themselves on power leads with fustration. - For example, there's a mission where you have to defend a briefcase, and a team put it on a ledge, which no-one could get to as it was so over-exposed that they could be shot from 360Â° Horrific.  Repitition. Gaaaah, this game is full of it. Most of the missions repeat themselves over and over again, the same mission, but in slightly different locations. This is fine for the first 10 hours, but after that you're seeing same old, same old over and over again. Nothing really changes as you sit there enduring the couple of minute wait between missions.  Community. It's â¥â¥â¥â¥, packed with hackers, and accusations of being a hacker. You'll rarely meet someone who's actually friendly, just people that are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off by you being utterly â¥â¥â¥â¥ and decreasing their status from Gold to Silver.  _Conclusion_  It's good for people that love customisation and shooting at things and driving, and that's pretty much it. I just happen to be one of that few that doesn't give a â¥â¥â¥â¥ about the cons.
881	1	a	Take a dive into the deep unknown of the criminal domain. Choose the good side or the bad side in a epic game of cops and robbers. Will you dive into the Criminal World where you rob stores and hold up people for everything they got. Or will you choose the good side of the law as a cop where you drive around in your car and shoot people for no reason. The choice is yours in this adventurous game of the year.  10/10 - BrandonMoore.TV
4005	0	a	The game in it's current state, I definitely cannot recommend. It has some pretty awesome customization, but thats honestly about all that keeps me coming back. The matchmaking is terrible, and there has only been cash shop item releases (no new real content) since G1 took over. They say proper new content will be possible once they finish the engine upgrade, but they've been promiseing the upgrade for 3+ years and it still seems it'll never be here. They also plan to overhaul the matchmaking system, which will definitely help keep new players around, as the system they have in place now is often exploited by veterans, and will end up matching them against newbies. With the fairly steep and long learning curve the game has, few will stick around to get the hang of it after getting steamrolled constantly.  tl;dr I would recommend this game once the matchmaking has been overhauled, and the engine upgraded, but in it's current state, it's skippable.
9886	1	a	This game has really great atmosphere. That is because most of the content is ripped straight from the Wasteland/Fallout universe. If you ever wanted to play a Fallout-ish MMO, this is the best choice. It's more focused on crafting and the whole 'carrot on the stick' gameplay, and of course you can just buy the carrot. I really enjoyed the short time I spent in game.  I'm torn about this game because, quite frankly, the community is just awful. Instead of Zone chat like in most mmo's, there's a Help chat. It's filled with players that have been there for a while, but most of them have that whole 'elite' attitude. Help chat is supposed to be used for people with questions, thus the name. These 'Elitists' will use Help chat for anything they want, berate and accuse new players of trolling, then turn around and lecture everyone on the 'proper way' to use Help chat. The GM's are even worse. They constantly hand out mutes/bans, but ignore any complaints towards the preffered players that have been there for a long time or spent probably $500 in the cash shop.   Also, the GM's are crazy about censoring peoples' screen names. I had a name that wasn't even offensive, I played for a bit and when I came back, my name was Cupcake1244. Yes, if they deem your name offensive, you get to roam the Wastelands as Cupcake____. And you only get 1 character slot as a F2P player. I contacted a GM about changing my name and guess what? Oh, you can BUY a name change in the cash shop. $10 because you got offended for no reason? Hah!  Unfortunately, I'm the type of person that's going to argue right back with you when you're acting douchey. So I told everyone off in Help chat and am uninstalling :)   To sum it up, if you enjoy the crafting side of mmo's with a Fallout/Wasteland atmosphere, go for it. But if you're not going to spend money on it, I'd suggest that you keep the chat window closed and just chat with people locally. You're going to want to avoid these Basement-Dwellers.
9145	1	a	Excelent game if you have a group, not so much without one. yet i can still say it was enjoyable to play, at least for me. i was looking for a post apocaliptic mmo that is what i found so i was satisfied, did i mention it was free? (well free-ish, there are still microtransactions) recommend playing in a group of at least 2-3 people
1353	1	a	It is like the free to play GTA 5. The combat is amazing and open world is huge. Come play this game! 
6150	0	a	this game looks good but its porly optimized so play it at you're won risk
10771	1	a	Very nice little game with lots of classes to choose from like the Wizzard, Huntress, Ranger and more, Also really addicting!
2430	1	a	A lot like GTA, but not quite, it is the best GTA resembled game I've ever played.

803	1	a	PvP + Action + Open World + Advanture + Nudity = OH YAHH  i Really Recommend This Game   P.S: Store system really â¥â¥â¥â¥ i mean  WTF Virtual Paid Weapons And Cloths  This â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t  any way i recommend this game

7668	0	a	I never got to try the game because it never would respond when it was in the middle of starting.
9732	1	a	a nice fun game kind of like fallout 7/10
8091	0	a	This game have a lot of cheaters now and is P2W. I'd rather to uninstall this for now untill they don't remove this options. But this is unbelievable. I had nice times with my friends and that's all. If you want to play just do it!
1812	1	a	This are the nicest game and i dont can stop play it
6147	0	a	This game is basically the dictionary definition of pay-to-win. Not to mention the overwhelming population of hackers and 12 year old girls running around with stun guns.

8895	1	a	  It's been 7 years or so, since I first started to play this game. For almost 2 years, I was barely surviving around Midway, trying to search for resources, never heard of Crafting recipes. Might sound like a bad joke, but truth be told, I was making some chips through the scavanging and buying new weapons, killing NPCs, then scavanging again. I was in love with what I've been doing, although I did not know at all anything about how the game works or where I had to go. In time, I was gaining a lot more knowledge about the game while growing. Sadly, humans can't understand many things at such a young age. It is 2016, almost winter, almost turning 2017. One year ago, the game has lost a massive amount of players, yet, Veterans still have the Fallen Earth blood running through their veins, keeping the game alive. All respect. I also count myself.
3340	1	a	THIS GAME IS GANGSTER
590	1	a	APB has tons of ways to customize and you can choose between being an enforcer or a criminal.
6623	0	a	Laggy gameplay, car physics broken, seemingly bad input lag, under average shooting mechanics. There are better free games out there than this.
4329	0	a	APB Reloaded is quite the interesting game. It's a fast paced 3rd person shooter MMO in a somewhat open world. I've enjoyed this game since 2013 (ah, the good old days.) The game itself is very buggy and can make no sense at all when it comes to combat sometimes. But if you actually get the hang of how the gun mechanics work then you should be set. Ad the driving, oh man the driving. these cars are hard as hell to drive. either too slow, too fast, car gets blown up too easy, can't blow up an enemy car cause it's too armored. This game requires a lot of skill and a buttload of learning. I say try it out and try to get past rank 60 and you might get addicted. And that stuff about being pay2win is all nonsense. the joker CR 5 has the same exact stats as an ntech. The difference is that you buy the joker CR 5 with real money. And if you actually pay for some of the packs, they come with awesome cars, clothes, and weapons. Every gun that is on the armas market (the place you go to spend real money) has different variant at the joker store (ingame store to buy guns with ingame currency). And speaking of gear, the customization is endless. Do you want to look like a soldier? A maid? A racer? Someone fro myour favorite franchise of games? you can do it all. I would recommend buying premium with this game. You get more contact standing, more money, and discounts on pretty much everything in the armas marketplace. You also get waaaaay more room to customize. It goes from a nonpremium member only having room to use 25 shapes to a symbol, to a premium member being able to use 100 shapes. I love this game and it has a special little home for me and a lot of the veterans on this game. Also, this was originally made by the people that made crackdown, so you'll notice some similarities.  TL;DR  Pros- no limit to creativity, be who you want there are quite a bit of nice people in the community, they just don't talk addicting super fun with friends cool guns cool cars  cons- The playerbase is usually extremely salty and mean they push you to buy stuff a lot it is very hard for a beginner to enjoy because it's an odd game mechanics can break and ruin everything too many bugs (can't do a mission because the mission just breaks for no reason) very, very, veeeery grindy game  As much as I love it. I only love this game because I've been playing it over the years and it is unique. Other than that it's a meh game.
5477	0	a	Bad. Boring, unbalanced, unoriginal, ugly, lazy, I cannot stress how bad this game is. Server problems aside, this is just, one of the WORST games, no wait, one of the worst FREE games, of all time. It's confusing, there's just about no tutorials to be found, the story is missing, the character creation is pretty lame. There is NO PVE, which wouldn't be a problem if the game wasn't P2W. There is nothing good to be found here, this beats big rigs, this game actually tried really hard to be good, and failed. The only reason it gets a 2, is because it's playable, not that you'd want to play it though. 2/10.
8606	0	a	Now I dont have 1000 hours plus in this game like some people here but Ive seen enough to make a fair verdict. As a noob its hard to pick up like most games. But in order to combat the higher ranking played s you either must get MLG or pay 40 bucks for a weapon. (real moeny) You could buy the weapon for a few days but then after that your screwed. I am no means good at the game but I'd like to think Im more of a novice as I was ranked silver 2 I believe? (This is actualy decent in this game not like CSGO) The whole conecpt is pretty cool and the customization amazing. But the whole combat and progression system is really hard to get used to. If anyone has anything to say about my verdict (like my opion matters) please tell me, am I just bad? am I using the wrong guns? Or am I just doing everything wrong? But for now, this game needs some serious balancing issues.
9994	1	a	Much improved bugwise in recent times. Truly f2p, but you will benefit from subscribing (crafting wise.) Lot to be said PvP wise here, but PvE is more meh. Fun cash shop, but a bit overpriced. Fun to just solo and fart around which is rare in MMOs. If you like crafting this is your Huckleberry.
7911	0	a	start game rank you high look to buy a gun buy one gun perm $30 -10/10 dont feed their money hording.
5708	0	a	Matchmaking is very frustrating. (Two Silvers v. Two golds) Weapons feel unbalanced, and paying members are definitely the winners in this (Pay-to-win) Freemium game.
7534	0	a	This game would have been fun but you have to download like 6 things and i still cant play. I cant delete it because it says its running when its not. If they cant fix all this download crap that you have to do and just keep is simple i would think about downloading it again.
5282	0	a	Never, ever, speak with any GM or CM or you will get banned.  Met GM in game who was speedhacking and aimboting Went on highest roof avaliable, switched to auto-camp sniper, started my macro, put it on 45ms. Sniped â¥â¥â¥â¥er out of the world. Happily logged off, after calling him a 'â¥â¥â¥â¥ing looser who cant win even with his cool aimbot'. Next day banned for cheats and insults aimed at other players.
1216	1	a	IT â¥â¥â¥â¥ING SUCKS I â¥â¥â¥â¥ING HATE IT ITS SO â¥â¥â¥â¥ING LAGGY AND THERE ARE SO MANY HACKERS AND THEY JUST KEEP KILLING ME EVERYTIME I WALK OUT OF A SAFEHOUSE
10715	1	a	its a good game
4681	0	a	I have been playing this game on and off for about 5 years. Everytime I had to take a break from the game it was all because the hackers. -Speed hacks -Aim bots -Walls Much more...  Point is it's fun but the hackers have killed the game and made it suck balls.
5441	0	a	Game is â¥â¥â¥â¥! Always has been. Always will be.
1359	1	a	it's the best game of the word 100/100
8908	1	a	Fallen earth is a great game that has a larger then most like learning curve,and that's most likley why it gets bad reviews. For being 7 years old and has no Dev support for the last couple. I still have a lot of fun running around the wastelands. It's crafting system is one of the best I have ever come across in any other MMO, only one better is SWG.  I would recommend this game over many of the new trash cookie cutter WOW clones that have been coming out lately.
8412	0	a	laggy servers, tons of hackers, shtt devs, 3rd person shooter tactics are aids
5847	0	a	Have you always wanted to play in bland, dead worlds? Have you always wanted to play a lame GTA ripoff? Do you want to waste space on your computer hard drive?  If all of those answers are no, don't get this. GTA is worth the money.
10657	1	a	Not as fun as back in 2012, but still a decent game. I still have a lot of fun playing with my friends. However, there's been an overall nerf to the game's difficulty that I do not like
197	1	a	Great game. Great F2P. People say its a pay to win game but just look in the guides to get free premium codes. Better than GTA in my opinion. So much customization.
8458	0	a	Edit: Basically take all my negative aspects of this review and amplify them and you have an up to date review...  APB: Reloaded is a online 'Cops-and-Robbers' third person shooter game. Gameplay revolves around joining one of two factions, the Criminals or the Enforcers, and then competing in open-world objective-driven missions throughout various districts in the fictional city of San Paro.  Gameplay: The core gameplay of APB is what drives it. It takes an old classic concept (Cops vs. bad guys) and puts a whole new spin on it. Customization of your character is incredibly vast. You can personalize your character's appearance, vehicle, 'theme song,' graffiti logo, and weapon (to an extent.) The physics in the game are a bit exaggerated which often lead to funny, if not frustrating moments. Combat can be fun if you know what you're doing or are playing with people at your skill level.   In that regard, APB does have a match-making system that's good at generally picking out who's a newbie (bronze level) and who's a pro (gold level), but once you get down into it the game just pushes silver players and gold players together which can be frustrating if the game misinterprets whether the player is actually ready to be in that bracket. FINALLY, and this is important. The game does have pretty shameless elements of P2W (Pay 2 Win.) There are weapons that can only be obtained through purchase with actual money and do provide a decent advantage over players who don't pay anything.  Visuals: Graphics hold up decently to more modern titles. While there's certainly no comparison to the next-gen iteration of Grand Theft Auto V, APB took a smart route by utilizing a more cartoon-y look. It's not a photo-copy of reality, but it's not trying to be. That said, it still looks quite good.  Community: This is something that needs to be said about this game. The community is, by-and-large, not the friendliest group of people on the planet. This is partly to be expected from the players of a game where crime, and stopping it by whatever means necessary, is the name of the game. However, I'm not sure I know of a game with more trash-talking and general inconsideration this side of Call of Duty. Asking for help will either get you scoffed at, or given just enough help to get by, and THEN scoffed at. If you want to play with a group of people who aren't ego-maniacs or raging craphats, disable District Chat and invite your friends to play the game with you.  Overall: Don't get me wrong, this game was a big part of my downtime during Spring Break. When trolls and tryhards aren't gunning you down continually with overpowered P2W weapons, this game is a ton of fun. Occasionally you'll find a match that actually accomodates your skill and everyone will be in the same boat as you, and you'll have a blast. Practice and you'll sometimes find yourself top of the scoreboard for a match or two. Just don't take it too seriously, it is afterall just a game. But if you're someone who prone to raging at video games to the point of breaking things, you might need to look elsewhere.
8826	0	a	inb4 engine update was a lie
843	1	a	cooool game Action
1100	1	a	Note: I actually have around 40 hours into this game, I'm not a huge noob.  This is not your normal MMO, it plays like a triple A crime game. The game takes place in a crime torn city called San Paro. The crime has gotten so bad that the mayor is giving out conceal and carry permits and letting vigilantes take justice into their own hands. So, that's where your character comes in. You start and pick a gender and customize your character. The customization options are nearly endless, and you can alter nearly every fine detail of your character. You pick to be either an Enforcer, which are the vigilantes, or a Criminal, which is pretty self explanatory. There are two main 'districts' where you can complete missions for crime bosses or respected vigilantes to increase your standing with them. These are big open worlds where you can do anything you want, whether that's doing missions, racing around, jumping your car off things, shooting stuff, well, you know, it's like GTA Online with MMO elements, which makes for an exciting game. The cars have nice variation to them, trucks have more power and less speed, cars are fairly fast and pretty weak, and then there are sport cars which are very fast and pretty weak, unless you equip them with extra armor. This game has many complaints about being pay to win, but I don't find it that way at all. I haven't put a penny in it, and feels pretty fair and balanced to me. The guns have some good variation to them too, which fit basically all playstyles. The mssions are team based, and are mainly the bad guys doing bad stuff, and the good guys getting sent out to stop them. It can actually be pretty fun though. The criminals can aslo commit crimes to make money, and Enforcers can catch criminals to make some extra cash. The community is ok, except for your occasional truck griefers, which you'll find out what they are most likely in your game time. So now, let's break it down.  Pros: Great Graphics Fun gameplay Good Variation Wide range of vehicles Nearly everything is customizable It's free You can do basically anything you want  Cons: Occasional lag Community can suck at times Textures don't always load in instantly Can feel repetitive if you're grinding to level up  I rate this game a 9/10
10691	1	a	Made murder my whole family  -10/10
2118	1	a	great for when you want a cause of suicide!
2789	1	a	Nothing is more then unique then APB, it has it's flaws, but the game model is quite the experience.
7295	0	a	this game is terrible
6039	0	a	That moment when ur teammate tries to kill u so u unload 3 magazines of your assault rifle into him and blow up a car in front of him but he walks up to u 2 seconds later and uses his pay 2 win gun to kill u in less than 1 second xdxdxdxdxd
7713	0	a	this is â¥â¥â¥â¥. it runs in the background with no way to stop it which lags everything else out. it is classisfied by steam as running so you cannot play or delete it. DO YOURSELF A â¥â¥â¥â¥ING FAVOR AND GET A DIFFERENT â¥â¥â¥â¥ING GAME BEFORE YOU â¥â¥â¥â¥ UP YOUR COMPUTER PERMANENTLY
8398	0	a	i can not sigh up
290	1	a	Good Games!
5546	0	a	Words cnat even describe how pay to win this is, but I can try.  First off it is important to note that the 'tutorial' the game gives you is little mpore than some stuff that you need to do, but it doesnt really say how and while you do it, your not in a seperate part of the game like most mmo's, no you are in the game, with no clue what to do.   Expect to have to pay a lot of gold to get anything in this game, although some cheap weapons are decent, the only last for 7 days, that is right, you have to buy new weapons every 7 days. Anything that is permanent like guns or cars, will cost you lots of money.  The whole G1C thing really ticks me off, its a premium currency used that you have to buy, (or earn in painfullly small amounts) that can buy the best of everything.   Matchmaking is broken, new players vs old, 5 v 2, etc   Story is almost nothing, imagine a quilt with 5 patches that are decnt looking, but they are all spread apart and sewn together using a dark brown thread that makes it look ugly.  Honestly, when i got this game, i saw the bad reviews and thought 'Whatver, this game looks awesoeme!', and even though i started with no expectations, somehow, this bundle of steaming horse crap has gone below my lowest expectations. Do not play this game, please, just trust me.  Overall -10/10
1028	1	a	its fun to play and its good but there is hackers.
10253	1	a	This was very good.  Allowed character customization Sort of like DayZ first person + third person perspective EPIC
4953	0	a	This game should still be in its alpha stage with how bad it is. The company doesn't do anything to help improve it. All they do is add crap pay 2 win guns that no one uses and skins. Barely any game fixes the game requires. If you going to play this game prepare to rage quit all the time, yell, scream, throw small children and light you pants on fire. Game started out fine then when south... fast. I have wasted so many hours and so much money that I am embarrased to talk about it. I would rate it about a -13 out of 10 but I can't sadly. So good luck GamersFirst, I mean GamersNever and I hope your company burns down one day out of overclocking those toasters you call servers.
6506	0	a	Download the game, and still haven't been able to get IN the game. If a download is this stupid.. Screw it!  I do not recommend this game

1195	1	a	This game is great fun when you are just â¥â¥â¥â¥ing with people. The actual core gameplay is abysmal.  My advice is try it for yourself, make a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ looking character, and go ram people in their little ricer cars. Endless fun.
763	1	a	Haven't played too much on this account but this game might not be the best anymore, but it is like a Cops'N'Robbers take on Saints Row, and both are loved by many and in conclusion, the game now isn't bad, still a little fun hourwaster. Kinda reminds me of CrimeCraft before they took it and â¥â¥â¥â¥ed it up with GangWars. Not a bad game. If you want a GTA-ish game, try it out!
5534	0	a	Cancer.
679	1	a	lol cool game but storyless
3614	1	a	I really loved this game, unfortunately my computer wasn't good enough to handle any of it's AWESOMENESS...so I had to uninstall it...*sadface*
2478	1	a	This game is pretty fun for free it's very good. The customization has a wide variety from things to choose and unlock from. If you are interested into a free roaming fun time download this.
7014	0	a	So i hit play and all it does is takes me to their facebook page saying like me. HOW STUPID!
352	1	a	It sucked back then, and it sucks NOW, TOO. 
8615	0	a	That's a Pay2Win game soo ...
10898	1	a	This game is fun .. but at the same time, addicting. Enter with caution.
10864	1	a	A Free-To-Play Bullet-Hell Shooter where you and many other people attempt to bring down the mad god. This is insanely hard, and it is great with friends, though it is viable alone. Highly recommend if you want a game like this one!
5030	0	a	The only reason i got this was because i didn't bother to spend any money and want to practice driving for my driving test because i thought it would give me some level of experience.           I failed the test
5492	0	a	i get an error about MSVCR not being designed to run on windows after multiple attempts at installing all the redist. packs, help? because this makes the game unplayable and i would love to have this game :(
7722	0	a	Here's my recommendation: that you AVOID this game, and REFUSE to pay any money towards the publishers: G1. The customization is great (well, what was left to GamersFirst by the original creators: Realtime Worlds, RIP), and the driving is funny in a Gmod-physics kind of way, but the combat is utterly deploreable. Biased towards the criminal faction, and favorable to those suckered into paying a monthly fee of around $9, this game is what gives 'Free to Play' a bad name. And as if that premium membership bonus (between x3 and x4 cash rewards for missions/activities, and faster leveling for unlocks) wasn't bad enough, but their marketplace sells items that, once bought, are not customizable, and many are exclusive to the real-money market. Seriously, a gun that looks like an AR but has the EXACT same secifications and performance as the in-game rentable AK costs $40. It's a $40 reskin. Marx isn't turning in his grave, he's weeping and saying 'I told you so!'
5915	0	a	This game is just OK.  Character customization is fantastic. Car customization is fantastic.  But thats about it. The game itself is full of hackers, and that ruins the actual gameplay. So if you love character/car customization, and dont mind getting pwnd by trolls check  this game out.
1047	1	a	If you feel like playing GTA but you don't have enough to buy the game, this game is a good substitute for it. APB is awesome. You can design your character like a badass muddapucker. You can get awesome guns and cars. You can race, play missions with your friends and kill pedestrian like a boss. The game is hard in the beginning because of some A-hole in the game who has better guns and cars than you. But don't be discourage, you'll get there. Trade items with your friends like an awesome car. Everyone should play this game, it's awesome.
10343	1	a	i absoulutly love this game. First time i have ever found a game with great deatail and lil to no lag .
7243	0	a	Okay I heard this a pretty good game but I cant play it because i figured i needed to download a â¥â¥â¥â¥ ton of stuff fit=rst then it cant play on windows 10 if they can fix I'll recommend it but for now no stars
8625	0	a	This game sucks... You are level 1 with the shitiest weapon that deals less than they regen per second. At level 1 you are instantly paired up vs max ranks that usually one shot you and spawn camp you. AND THE PERFORMANCE OOOOOH MY GOD, one second you have 60 fps in another you have 10-15 fps. And believe me its not only me its everyone. Don't download this game it sucks.
1738	1	a	Best f2p game to play with friends
9220	0	a	spanning multi accounts, starting a civil war long ago against a clan in my own faction. death to RFDC lived on and the endless fun and hours of destruction will always have a place in my heart. but the devs have now become hackers and have abused their ways, the game is dying. faction wars and game polulation is down. i am sad to say it but fallen earth has fallen. and will not recover.
8256	0	a	It was fun. I would recommend it if it wasnt P2W now. Sadly they ****ed up this game. It was a great game tho !
1957	1	a	Amazing game. Can get super cool looking guns. Make your person look however you want. Lots of helpful people. 1 problem. TAKES AGES TO LOAD
6532	0	a	This game was one of my favourite games...but it went really bad, but why ? The Armas Weapons (pay with real money) are really expensiv so you can pay up to 40â¬ for a account bounded sniper rifle. The most armas weapons are too strong like the 'scout' ,a new sniper rifle, you can shoot perfectly with it in the air you can use it outta a car and you can run with it...lets look on the free 2 play sniper rifle you cant do jumpshot you cant fire outta a car you cant run with it and the fire slower then the premium ones...but the biggest problem of the game is: that the gold players ( the strongest players haha ) play on the silver destricts or on bronze so you have no chance against some overpowered players who kick you out of the match in your own destrict...everything what i can say is: stay away from this game if you cant play in a team and if you wont pay money to win.
5361	0	a	This game has a lot of good ideas, but it also has a lot of bad ones. To keep it as short and simple as possible, this game is very unforgiving, especially to newer players. Prepare to spend several hundred hours competing against max level gold ranks with pay 2 win guns who are organized, probably with voice comms. After you manage to learn to cope with that (assuming you don't quit first) you might ascend to the point of being capable of enjoying this game.   Or just play another shooter.
8192	0	a	THIS IS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥TTTTTTTTTTT  I â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ UNISTALLED AFTER PLAYING THIS â¥â¥â¥â¥ OMFG DONT DL  THIS IS A LOAD OF â¥â¥â¥â¥
1203	1	a	It is so so.
8588	0	a	This game is unique and addictive. It's like GTA, just that it has smaller maps. The gameplay is a lot batter and the customization is epic. Back when it came out i would recommend this game, but not anymore. I am not saying that all the things GamersFirst did were bad, but a lot of them were. Now let's go to the sad part. It has unbalanced missions and weapons, bad spawns, matchmaking, community and it contains lot's of bugs, that are not getting fixed. Marketplace is too expensive, the servers are unstable and are sometimes being ddosed. When that happens the ms jumps over 150, makes it unplayable. They are not adding any new stuff to the game that they promised long ago (like new contacts, free content) nor are they listening to community wishes. The engine upgrade has been in making for eva and they keep postponing the date of its release!  The game has been in a really bad shape for a long time and considering what have we the community seen so far, there is no chance it will get any better anytime soon, maybe never who knows....
10590	1	a	The game is very fun. But after level 20 it starts getting way too based in ONLY getting better items. (Which you can also simply purchase from the store) *Cough* Pay to win *Cough* You then spend hours risking your neck (Not to mention a simple lag spike when facing a boss will end in tears), to get a SOMEWHAT good item, try to trade it for something you want/need and WILL get scammed in the most ridiculous way.  10/10 will kill Scorpion Queens for hours.
3604	1	a	This Game is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO AWSOME! 
2780	1	a	The worst â¥â¥â¥â¥ing imbalanced crappy piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ you could ever play.Stay far away and let it die once and for all.good game for griefers,trolls amd hackers.
4166	0	a	i try using the client it keeps crashing errorYou were kicked by PunkBuster for the following reason:  'PunkBuster kicked player 'PlayerName' (for 0 minutes) ... RESTRICTION: service communication failure: PnkBstrBprogram driver failure (PnkBstrK.sys) ffab'  i have tried the PunkBuster random kick fix where i need to download the PBsetup and then install that to the APB Reloaded folder, And then run it and install PunkBuster again, Then add APB Reloaded to the game list and check for updates. I've done all this about 5 times i have also download the PBsvc to try and fix any errors within PunkBuster but have not found a solution that has done anything to help, So now i am on here begging for a solution to this pointless annoying problem, in the hope that someone smarter than me might no what i may have missed out on.  i am having the same problem but i deleted it and download it again shut down my laptop and it worked a little bit like a few minutes but then it crashed and said the same thing again and was unable to log into it at all.  i like this game its a really good game i played a little bit the shooting was good but in the video grenade should of killed people throwing grenade should of killed people if they had no body armour .  not being able to host your own game or host room is really bad and not being able to solo with out using matchmaking really sucks since if there no one online i have no idea but if you can't play with out matchmaking or players that is honestly stupid since this game looked amazing and creating your person very good programming and car programming and the aiming and the blood shoot dripping is perfect.  this game looks really good so far i played it a little bit but it needs a lot of love and lot of work it could be the best gta for steam.
2398	1	a	i think game APB reloaded so good and I verry like game.
1523	1	a	A very good game. Recomanded
4129	0	a	you thought a crime vs cop game would be fun? TOO BAD â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. yo will get â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ by everyone, breaking shops gives little to no reward, and you get a bounty usually higher than your gains... new car? spend some days in, you might get one lmao.  this game suffers from a pay to use customisation system, is heavily trying to make you pay for everything, and has a poor optimisation (level 9 players can hunt level 3's who broke shops) not to mention clans, who usually run on beginner tears to level up their members.  you start with crappy weapons which do less damage than a .22LR while looking full-size, you get your dime ten times for everything you try....and there is ninjas everywhere.
7343	0	a	Now I can see that this game definitely had a lot of potential in the beginning, but the end product is a broken mess that is confusing, tedious, and repetitive. The major upside of this game is that the character customization is far superior to many other games. Other than that, there's hardly anything worth mentioning about this game. My advice: Don't waste your time, and certainly DON'T waste your money on this game.
8525	0	a	Legit player who took there time and money to this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game get Fairâ¥â¥â¥â¥ed while obvious cheaters can cheat for 2-3 years and not get banned
4649	0	a	I have played this game for 287 hours and honestly was one of the worst experiences i have had in gaming. From the ridiulous leveling system, to the quite frankly pay to win aspect of the entire game, i would honestly NEVER recommend this game to anyone.  The community can be extremely toxic and vulgar, with casual swearing and slurs in chat, just a small anoyance, but nevertheless.  The only good thing that this game has to it is playing with friends. The only possible way to beat the NUMBER of broken guns is by using a 3-4 person group on a single person. This might sound absurd, but unfortunately, this imbalance does exist.  The only reason why i have this amount of hours on the game is playing with friends, and the addiction that this game shoves down your throat, along with the 'you must pay to play this game evenly against your opponents' attitude.  Dissapointing that trash like this exists on steam.  EDIT: Grammar stuffs
4208	0	a	Slightly enjoyable when playing with a group of friends... not a stellar recommendation but it is words put together to form a quasi-sentence.
8597	0	a	awefull balance on top of P2W and cancerous community.  Amazing character creation system, spoiled by the terrible actual gunfights where if you dont submitt to the meta of the game (tank LMG, or clotting SMGs/shotguns/RPGs.) then you will always be at a disadvantage.  Game developers are cancer with the players, constantly worsening the game and adding in just more pay to win aspects to the shop, all of which cost about $30-40 just for a permanent single weapon. Having added almost no extra maps besides 2 small arena modes and 2 open conflict (kill on sight) versions of the already present ones.  No graphical updates, and the only vehicle diversity among players you'll see or hear is either loud crotch grabbing rap music or â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ over compensating short â¥â¥â¥â¥ metal/hard rock with only either Humvee vehicles to troll payers with ramming outside of missions, or a mustang based car thats only got speed on its side.  Faction balance is also thrown away, enforcers seem to be a high risk, high reward play style, with the only way to gain money being missions or alot from arrests. You can earn money through impounding stolen vehicles and evidence delivery or witnessing but good luck as most players on criminals are smart to remain unwitnessable and rarely use any vehicle but their own unless they are new, making enforcer faction practically impossible to earn a decent cash sum up on unless you get good gear. On the other hand criminals can get money practically anywhere, and can reach a $1000-2000 bounty extremely quickly, before being unwitnessable by just â¥â¥â¥â¥ing away from normally quiet areas. Giving criminals an almost endless suply of cash when needed, as well as having the population majority based there. (probably due to that.)  You know how i mentioned arresting criminals in apb as an enforcer? Good luck as well, without the stun shotguns or the taser you stand no chance from premium weapons or rather really any guns. The AR based one requires 7 hits of a 20 round magazine and when players are jumping and running speedy gonzales, then your bound to have almost no spare ammo.  The character customization is amazing, and personally this game's selling point, but again, its squandered by the fact that you cant unlock anything clothing wise fast enough to expand customization. Though if your a good artist you can make a pretty penny from the marketplace from your clothing creations, and probably could turn a profit that way.   The map lay outs and draw distance is honestly some of the worst i've seen. The draw distance has only ever gotten worse becuase people complained about snipers, now its at 100 meters, where litterally any pistol could outgun you, so the only 'snipers' you'll see are corner peekers and jump shooters. When this game has so many potential campaing spots with hard to reach manners, and dont give me the anti-camp â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. Its a legitimate defense strategy in video games if given the option, you complaining about it is the same thing as the allies saying â¥â¥â¥â¥ you to germany during WW1 for using submarines when it was a practical and obvious choice for the war of attrition.  On top of the draw distance all the mission lay outs are CQC based, litterally no sniping spots are able to oversee the positions of objectives, and this brings me to another major flaw:  THE RED â¥â¥â¥â¥ING NAME TAG. AT THE MAX DRAW DISTANCE your given an extremely bright, red, nametag thats litterally visible to everyone even looking around, and this litterally makes it impossible to flank, snipe, or even set up actual good coordinated stationary defensive ambushes.  I do like one aspect of the gameplay and its that the minimap is only gunfire, and audio based. You will not see enemies on the minimap if they make no noise, or are not spotted (good luck not being spotted for reason above.)  The ranking system for pvp is also â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t, golds can ACTIVELY put themselves lower rank, thus fighting people litterally lower tier than them, think of CSGO an global elite versus new players to the game. Which msot of the time you wont see green tier servers (which are the only locked ones.) having player counts enough to support new players healthily.  The vehicle handling on almost every early-mid tier vehicle is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, and delayed. Taking a full second to actrually obey a command to turn or such, the only exception is fast cars, which leads me to believe its speed based. Meaning all those mustang based car users (forgot actual name.) are, again, getting the best â¥â¥â¥â¥ in the game.   I give this game a 2/10.  I'll only rarely even think of touching this game, and thats mostly for customization amazingness, but like i said, thats really its only selling point. BF: HARDLINE Was legitimately better than this game in every field but its Dead on PC, the only reason this isnt the case is everyone loves the customization thats never present in any other shooter. That and the P2W buddies are willing to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars on their OP weapons which the devs refuse to nerf. (check the forums, youll never see patch notes for weapons that involving decreasing or increasing any stats unless they are sniper rifles or other weapons that are never used. The AK47 (N-tec) was one of the only competitive rifles to use against SMGs and they nerfed its tap fire, but they havent even touched the commonly used p2w weapons.)  My recomendation for improvement: Kill this game, and actively dont play any gamers-first games, if we're lucky theyll do a 180 turn and actrually balance it once they see profits go down (this is what happens with games like warface which was a notoriously bad P2W before finally shaping up and are now semi-decent F2P games.).  Otherwise, i dont see hope for this game. Its loosing a small amount of players every 2 weeks, which is honestly a good sign, and it finally lost its positive status which was litterally just people trying to sympathize with the game due to its character creation aspects and unique cops vs criminals....or nostalgia. All of which never address the issues of the game or handling balance issues seriously enough.

6463	0	a	This game isn't really new-user friendly. It handles much like GTA, but guns are unlocked based on your level, and you have to kill people do gain levels. They basically start you out with a stick and everyone else has rocket launchers. It's more fun to play with a friend, especially if you're just starting. Friends are more likely to put up with your learning curve than the community would.

10681	1	a	I know everyone is Upset with the Pay2Win mechanics of the game, but I assure you the game is still fun. Most people who pay for their gear arent the greatest and will eventually die with it anyway. Playing through the game and getting better with each dungeon will tone your skills. I have only ever spent money on some extra vault space and character slots with the Noob pack, 200 hours of Game play and I am using the top tier loot and have leveled my own pet up without paying.    Don't blame those who Pay2Win as a reason for ruining the game. I do think Kabam should remove Tops from the store though.
3384	1	a	If they remove all the hackers would make the game so much better, but if they did that it would be such a fun gmae

2333	1	a	At first, I was a little sceptical about how good and fun this game would be. I've received various feedbacks from my friends about this game and not too many of those feedbacks got me interested in downloading this game.  Nevertheless, I thought to myself, 'I cannot make irrelevant assumptions based on peoples' opinions and perspectives.' And I've got to say I'm glad i downloaded APB Reloaded. I've been playing the game for well over 30 hours now. And i have seen some complains about hackers spoiling all the fun. Well from what i see, there are not many hackers. I rarely face any of them when i'm playing. The gun play might not be the best, but it surely is A WHOLE LOT OF FUN. And not to mention the ability to customize your character and vehicles. It is simply outstanding.  The only thing that bothers me about APBB is the driving. Well, i have always been experiencing 2 second delays when i hit the 'A' and 'D' buttons to turn left and right in my vehicle. That is pretty much the only thing i have to complain about. Besides that, i have no complains whatsoever.   So, if any of you guys are still pondering whether to download APB, pondeer no longer. It is a great Free-To-play game. The only thing you have to get used to is driving. It only takes a metter of time to practice a little and you'll be fine and dandy. DOWNLOAD APB!! IT IS AMAZING
9794	0	a	Horrible Graphics and almost no actual good storylines, until this gets better i don't suggest anyone to play or download this dog sh*t of a game
2033	1	a	I have just one question. How hard is it to make controller support? very shameful
10602	1	a	Realm of the Mad God is both one of the best games I've ever played and one of the worst. I first started playing the game in April of 2012 with a couple of friends. Initially, I wasn't hookedâpixel graphics, permadeath, MMO, bullethell...none of them exactly appealed to me. I drove the game from my mind completely.   But a few days later, in a bout of extreme boredom, I decided to hop into the game. Gave myself a nameâNathansbudâand hopped into the fray. And by God, it was FUN! Sure, I was horrible, but that didn't stop me from having a great time running around the lowlands. After that point, I was hooked through and through. I played the game for nearly a year without really getting 'good' in the least, until I finally maxed my first character (which can be accomplished by drinking enough stat pots to hit the max, items which drop from a variety of enemies and dungeons), an Archer. I had this character for months, and it ended up being my first character to hit 5 Stars, or 2000 fame (experience, essentially).   Fast forward to now, 4.5 years into playing Realm of the Mad God (with a year break in between). The game has had its ups and downs, good times and bad, some overtly P2W features were implemented at times, but all in all, the game is certainly worth picking up and playing. And if you do end up giving it a shot (which you should, as the game is free), shoot me a PM. I'm Nathansbud in game.  Overall: 9/10

8147	0	a	all the horrible things are true..... so true..... PLUS if you play as bandit you just randomly surrender.  this game will lower your opinion of the human race no matter how bad it already was
10422	1	a	The game is great when you play with friends. Me and my buddy's never play the game alone. As soon as we where all home from school/work ect we would play. Goof game when you are with friends
10652	1	a	RotMG has had something of a checkered past. From it's storied inception at the hands of indie dev Wildstorm Studios to it's dubious sale to Kabaam, and now this latest chapter as the game is once again sold to Deca Games. Let's be clear. The time with Kabaam were some dark days. But it speaks to the resiliency and devotion of the fanbase/community that so many players soldiered on through the bad times and stayed with this game for so long.   Kabaam's handling of bugs and duping was poor. Really poor. One of the biggest issues when I last player the game about two years ago was that the 'Amulet of Resurrection'... the only item in the game that could save your character if it was 'killed' was normally a very expensive and difficult to acquire item. But so many people were duping them that the in game economy was flooded with them and no one was dying. Turn and churn is a really big part of this game so when no one dies the game stagnates. Kabaam handled this complex issue with a sledgehammer turning all the amulets into 'Amulets of Zombification.' I personally felt violated. They went into my vault inventory and took items I had earned and replaced them with something far inferior without asking me or discussing it with me. I was already furious.   Then they completely botched their communication with the community. Telling us that this new amulet had a 5% chance of turning your character into a Zombie and thus... failing to save it. When your character is dead in RotMG it's dead. Nothing is saved. So when you lose a maxed character with great gear it's a big deal to a lot of players. And it turned out that the Amulet that was supposed to only have a 5% chance of letting us die was in fact about 95%. Everyone started dying and turning into zombies. I lost a maxed 8/8 Huntress that turned into a Zombie and I was furious. I walked away from the game and hardly looked back despite having three other maxed characters. Time passed.   Kabaam eventually created a pet system to replace the Amulet. No your pets can't save you if you die. But by grinding and grinding you can create a pet so powerful that bosses and dungeons that were super dangerous are far less so. But other than the introduction of a lot of new dungeons and content that seems to be the end of Kabaam's major changes. And bugs and duping have persisted this entire time.  For example there's a bug that if you try and drag an item into your inventory and someone else snags the item (often with the reviled 'auto pickup' programs that many players now must use to compete with multi-boxers and hackers) before you get it all the way into your inventory it creates a 'ghost' of that item. This ghost will not disappear. And it can block and make useless as many as four inventory slots. And with only 8 slots on the base character that can really hamper your ability to pick up items. What's worse the 'ghost' cannot be dispelled without reloading the program entirely. Merely going to the Nexus, your vault or changing realms works. The item 'ghost' even persists in the loading screen. And while I understand this was done to fix a duping bug a better solution SURELY should have been found in the two years that have passed since I first encountered it.   But despite these issues RotMG is one of the most consistently fun and addicting games I've ever played. And with the sale to Deca games there's hope that their profession of being fans and devotees of the game themselves will lead to long needed fixes and improvements. For example, there's no way to play fullscreen. The game was originally designed to play on a small computer monitor inside a web browser and that initial design has never been improved upon. Despite the game being years old and being passed to it's 3rd developer and losing a lot of its playerbase there is still no way to play it full screen. In Steam you can stretch the window to make it bigger than the tiny default window... but beware, because if you don't keep the aspect ratio correct... and there is no way to constrain it, you can throw off the way the game is presented to you. The best case scenario is some menus will only present half their information and some ads may block your inventory. The worst case is thinking there is a monster in a certain spot when it is actually a bit closer to you and to the left. It can get you killed if you aren't careful.  Another issue is the HP and Mana Pots. Not the stat pots but the blue and red potions that you use to replenish lost HP or magic power while in a fight. Initially Kabaam, in a rather blatant money grab, made it so when you ran out of these pots and hit the hot key to use one the system would automatically take five 'Gold' (the in game currency that is purchased for real world money) and sell you the pot instead of telling you that you were out. After much furor from the community Kabaam implemented an off switch for this in the controls. However I have found that if you do shut off auto purchasing these pots and then hit the hot key when you are out of them and in a fight a large UI box pops up, covering much of your fighting area, and asking you if you want to buy the pot for 5 gold as you are out. It's horrifying. It almost got my 8/8 Knight killed twice in a five minute period. Really freaked me out and it's a really poor implementation.   Additionally I'd say there are issues altogether with the way these pots are sold. Mana and HP Pots are super easy to get. A high level character is so powerful that the low level mobs that drop them get mowed down like bowling pins by maxed out characters. Yet it can be time consuming and annoying to be farming baby mobs just so you have a bit of healing and magic replacement for the dungeons and big fights you actually want to be doing as a maxed character. And purchasing these pots at 5 Gold is a ridiculous and usurious price to charge for something so easily obtained and unimportant to the game. It's like charging a person for putting air in their tires. Sure there are coin operated air compressors but I have yet to run into a service station that doesn't simply turn it on for free. Because while we all realize you need air in your tires it isn't something of great value or scarcity. The same goes for these pots. They are neither valuable nor scarce but you need them. And high level players wasting time scouring the land for them is sort of silly. My hope is that this new owner, Deca Games; in addition to making many other improvements and bug fixes, sees the wisdom in reducing the price for these items and encouraging their use at the same time. For example you can carry up to six of each of these pots for a total of twelve. Can you imagine how much more gold Deca would sell and how more often these micro purchases would be made if they simply offered to top your inventory off for one gold? Imagine... you're going out to the realm and you want to head to the god lands or someone is opening a dungeon in the Nexus. You hit a button and for one gold you get your HP and Mana pots inventory filled up. I'd do this at least once almost every time I played. Probably for multiple characters.   Right now gold is roughly 100 to 1 in real world to in game value. So one dollar US is equal to 100 Gold. So at the current rate buying HP and Mana pots to fill your inventory of six each would cost a staggering sixty cents. More than half a dollar for something so unimportant. Thus I and most players have NEVER purchased them. But if it was 1 gold to fill er up. You bet your â¥â¥â¥ I'd use it.   Deca Games is doing a lot of giveaways and has proclaimed this and the following four weeks the 'Month of the Mad God.' There's a lot of celebrating and they've done an excellent job of energizing and motivating the community on social media. Lets hope that energy carries over to improvements and new content for the game. But even if it doesn't. RotMG is crazy fun.
4067	0	a	Worst game in existance. Freezes and Crashes constantly, Hackers everywhere, Laggy, Glitchy, and a complete Clone of GTA  EDIT: It's also pay to win, the devs are money vampires, they suck the money oudda ya' wallet!  I would give this a 3/10 at least the graphics are nice, but that doesn't matter because it won't even let me frickin (YOU FREAKING FRICKS WHEN WILL YOU LEARN) move and then freeze and crash..
6898	0	a	the perfect game for someone who has days of free time just to get enough money to buy a small amount of things  4.5/10000000

1415	1	a	not a bad game if i do say so myself when u play this u get a chice between gangsters and cops you get to choose aliances with major crime synidacate's and many more check it out
7733	0	a	I would recommend this game to a lot of people, but I will not! Just because there are too many cheaters since the F2P release...!
5335	0	a	If you like cops and robber pvp sure this is the game for you. Although, be warned that the damage system is all f*ck up and will only make you say WTF at every gun fight you enter.   Don't waste your time and money on this game, it doesnt worth it.
2509	1	a	This is the most vile pile crap ever made for pc. Its a virtual sewer if there ever was one. The people in this game are very helpful. And by helpful i mean they will help you  Die and Lose missions by blocking your car or placeing their own vehicle over the drop zone. And great freinds who will kill you as soon as look at you. And of coarse everyone has something nice to say. Usually lots of kind words that happen to have only 4 letters. Any way ... if your head is not in a toilet somewhere go ahead and get this game. its awsome.
3081	1	a	Its pretty good but can be improved 
5841	0	a	Let me first say that I have several hundred hours from the sandalone version, so I've played more than the 7.9 on my account. The game is fun, it's sort of like a knockoff GTA. You can be a bad guy, rob shops and get into turf wars, do fun violent things, etc. The games biggest benefit, though, is the fact that you can also be a cop. Any cop players who see the criminal players doing bad stuff or doing missions can immediately intervene and **** them up, which makes for some good fun, and fighting real players as cops is a lot more fun than the crappy AI in games like GTA.  However, this game suffers immensely from it's pay-to-win tactics, through which you will dominate all other players if you have $20 to blow. The devs tout your ability to customize your character, despite the fact that if you want to place more than a few decals on your car or make an intricate design on your clothes you again have to pay money. Want one of the good guns? Give us money. Want to use said guns for more than a few days? MORE money. Want to get a decent car? ALL THE MONEY. You want to KEEP that car? Oh baby you know that's only allowed if you want to spend money. 'Wow our game is so cool and free-to-play.'  Honestly if they scrapped all the pay-to-win stuff and just charged $10-$20 for the game, this would be a fantastic game. The core features and physics are strong, the gameplay is fun when you're not being bulldozed by people with expendable income, and the game has tons of variety. But all of these strengths are shadowed by the money-grubbing nature of this game. Until they update to a new engine as they've been promising for a long time, and at least cut back on the pay-to-win features, this game is NOT worth playing.   In my opinion, the devs should just design the game again from the ground up with a new engine and release it as a seperate game at a reasonable price. There's no excuse to not do that.

You are on a mission to bring down a battalion of ruthless mutant soldiers, and save the world. ...is what I would like to say. Don't trust the screenshots that allude to gameplay.

1245	1	a	I played this when it was in beta even though my in game hours don't show it. I can recomend this game to others.  Pros: Easy reward system for quests. Easy to fallow Quest system. Cars with atributes that are resonable( maybe not some will come with a big price tag on them), and some what customize-able. Striat forword Totrails when offered. Unlock ranks for some guns/ cars.  Cons: Like any other game that is free there is a paiying side, is the paying side rewarded more, yes and loads I haven't played in a while and can't tell but, some times on either(cops or criminals) side there would be an extremly high level high ranking player sitting on the edge of town with a sniper shooting into spawn, halours events fallowed. Car controls last I played were jarring and unstable unsre if it was becuase of type of car. (Yes that matters alot in ths game).  I cann not say much about the rest of the fetures of the game becasue I acullty haven't exploered all that much. I may change my review later for a better desription and general knowladge.
2975	1	a	good time waster
10707	1	a	Work of art-10/10  This is almost better then Dota 2. Pretty tough choice to make. In Dota 2 (check my review for Dota 2) I stare at black screens all day and in ROTMG I go pew pew.   I love the fact that these kids pay tons of money for gear they will lose in the next day.
4810	0	a	Where to start? Hackers, Team killers, Unknown lags (graphics), Money hunters, Bad support, Balance,
4038	0	a	This game is A pay-to-win game, even after four years to make this game something worthwhile. Like i said, the only way to do good in this game is to dump your wallets out. Save yourself from a bad third-person shooter with bad animation, every gun is a recycled image, and if you dont spend some money, your stuck with crappy stuff. Dont get addicted, save your hard earned cash and buy GTA if you want something like this. Also it's a pain to drive any vehicle in this game and AI civilians run and scream even if you roll by at 5 mph and aren't even close to hitting them. Oh well, i guess we can keep on dreaming about that game that this used to be.
4380	0	a	super confusing just end up getting ran over and over but the other team
230	1	a	this game is good get it now 
2495	1	a	its the greatest game ever :)
3027	1	a	very nice game
7430	0	a	this game keeps on crashing and hanging i do not recommend it
8992	1	a	Do not play this game if : 1.You do not want to invest a lot of time 2.You do not want a crafters-dependent economy. 3.You can not stand exploring for many hours. 4.You are addicted to FPS. 5.''OMFG!! FALLOUT RIPOFF''  You will either like it or hate it.This game is not for the many.In any case give it a try..it is free. After 150 hours I am still playing..and haven't even scratched its surface. 
7043	0	a	Really, it isn't too much fun. You can't really change the look of your character, mission can be hard, everyone is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. If you're looking for an F2P GTA, this isn't what you came for. If you came for a TPS with some decently good graphics, hop onboard.
2679	1	a	how do i staert it 
9588	0	a	uhh not my type of quiet lame action. if your super board an dont do shiz all day then i might recommend this game. for now thou. hell no. game is dumb.
724	1	a	A british person told me to get this game. I deleted it shortly and cut off all communication with the british person and his associates.
7283	0	a	wont work for me D:
2469	1	a	No, I actually canÂ´t recommend this game to anyone. In the beginning youÂ´ll get kill-farmed by the veterans, the mission design is repetitive and the community is the worst IÂ´ve ever seen. Still, IÂ´ve played almost 450 hours with my two chars, so there has to be something with this game... Enjoy!^^
1304	1	a	its aight
2972	1	a	I can't say I played enough to give a proper review. 10/10
109	1	a	GAVNO game.I'll better play RS.
4630	0	a	i not cant play..... Why? the launcher of â¥â¥â¥â¥ download to 32KBPS!!! 256 MB In 32KBPS = 160 minutes To wait!! NOPE unistall.. my internet download to 350KBps.... and... is a pay2win.... only good game P2W is World of tanks... other nope.
2444	1	a	Where do I even start with is game. you got guns. you got hip hop. and you got customization like you wouldnt even â¥â¥â¥â¥ing think possible. this game is the â¥â¥â¥â¥. you even wanna roll 4 deep with some homies and just shoot up â¥â¥â¥â¥? well in this game you can. need I say more?
5866	0	a	stay away from apb, unless you're a masochistic.
6119	0	a	This game is like cancer, I wouldn't even wish my worst enemy to play it. The game is trash so don't even bother.
9798	0	a	I played it. Got renamed to a ridiculous name because my name offended the you know who. Then the same mod who had renamed me popped up in main chat to ask people to keep the discussion to game related Q&amp;A. I wasnt even chatting at the time, and the people who were were simply chit chatting. Apparently this is too much for this concentration camp of a game. No fun allowed. Only talk about the game.  I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hate this â¥â¥â¥â¥. Burn down every game company that manages its users like stupid cattle. God forbid giving personal details or talking about fun stuff. It might create you know, DISCUSSION. We dont want that. We want stupid morons who only talk about the game and pay their dues. Die. Eat it and die.
2152	1	a	Fun game...if you are a GTA fan this game is like it.
6526	0	a	Feels like a bad russian Ripoff of Saints Row 3
520	1	a	Good TPS!  You can drive, shoot. Pure PvP! (I'm an idiot! xD ) It has a lot of guns, even a social map (it's rare to see that in a shooter game).  The best: Customization. You can even draw things on your clothes! *-* &lt;3  The worst: Cash guns with time limit. I hate when devs put those things! -.-'
1877	1	a	Gimme that punk! &lt;3
2247	1	a	When you lose, you can mug some people. Best way to chill.
2605	1	a	As a grizzled APB veteran with a staggering 2.4 hours on record, I can safely say that this game sucks alpaca gooch.
9556	1	a	It's like Fallout, but with multiplayer.
1422	1	a	Be a cop so you can racially profile and randomly beat them without any reprucussions!   10/10 would beat again
2302	1	a	i have real big mixed opineons with this game imm not going to lie. but heres something they need to tweak: dont make it p2w, make gold players go to gold servers (same with silver and bronze) but other than thoes 2 things its a real solid game 7/10
8379	0	a	This game sucks so bad omg , it looks fun but once u start playing it.. its so boring and lame
7680	0	a	I do not recommend this game. If you are beggner go do some misions some pro player will snipe you or kill u with rpg on sight. Best game i have ever uninstalled
4078	0	a	The game of great promises, greater disappointment and epic development fail. The game that's supposed to be every little boy's cops-n-robbers dream come true. However because of poor managment not only did it sink the company behind it, but even under the wings of a new owner people connected with the development process, being it developers or community managers, either got fired a few times or quit on their own.  The game is extremly newbie unfriendly, the weapon/shooting/engagement mechanics are so weird that the experience gained in other FPS/TPS games doesn't carry well into this one. There's a tutorial (finally, after being worked on for about 1,5 year or so), but it doesn't teach you anything that will help you to survive against hardened old timers of San Paro, because let's face it - the only people left still playing this game are the ever so bitter die-hards, that are so addicted, they won't let go. Be advised, you'll be facing them often, and when you do, they'll pull every dirty trick in the book, do anything and everything in their power to make your stay in San Paro as miserable and frustrating as they are.  So is this game this bad? That's a trick question. There's this really nice matchmaker feature that should match you up against people of simmilar skill level. It should, but currently the population pool is so low that the matchmaker has some real proplems finding the right people, so don't be surprised if a lot, if not most, of your missions are extremely one-sided. And most often you'll be on the wrong side.  APB is also the only game I ever played in which just driving around the map during the mission and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off your opponents can be way more fun than actually playing the game like it was meant.  It's also the only game that ups its hardware requirements bit by bit with each patch. I remember the times when I could record the game in 60FPS, 800x500, while running the game in 60FPS HD with highest detail settings and antialiasing. I don't know what went wrong, but the last time I ran it, I could barely get 45FPS on medium settings.  The greatest power of this game is that it's one of a kind, there's really no other like it. All the shooting and driving, and shooting while driving, car chases, skirmishes, sudden twists... all of this is great fun... until you get screwed either by being matched against a group of four teamspeaking clannies that will â¥â¥â¥â¥ you silly, or just the game itself, like: â¢ being spawned 150m from the objective while the opposing team spawns right next to it, â¢ being spawned in some sh!thole where the civilization suddenly died and noone owned a car, with the closest car spawner farther than the objective itself, â¢ the objective spawning in a place thats nearly impossible to storm when properly defended, ofcourse with the enemy already guarding it â¢ general respawn mechanics - missions get won or lost because of it. â¢ weird camera workings, which results in your toon often obstructing whatever you're aiming at, â¢ bugs that remain unfixed to this day, â¢ so you just switched to your sniper rifle? Nice, but now the fight moved to a close quartes area, take your precious mission time and switch again; you did? Great, but we could use a sniper now... ... I could go on like this. There are just so many gameflow breaking faults of random annoyance that at some point you're so fed up with the game that you quit... only to go back two weeks later to have a lot of fun and then suddenly being reminded what â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ you so much in this game, and you quit again... this love-hate relationship may go on for a while, but at some point you grow the maturity to finally quit, uninstall and never look back.  Currently the game dies little by little with the population systematically shrinking each month. There's a (supposedly) big update coming up (that's been delayed 2 years already) which will replace the dated, old, heavily customized Unread Engine with a 'factory issue' Unreal 3 engine (if I remember correctly). A lot of people bound great hopes with this event, however, as devs stated, the new engine will bring a bit better graphics and will allow to bring more content to the game a lot easier and faster. By more content I understand probably more guns, cars and clothing which will be sold thru ARMAS - the ingame cash shop. IMHO APB doesn't need more content, as it won't fix the game's fundamental issues, frustrating gameflow breakers and dangling pieces of gameplay mechanics that Real Time Worlds never managed to properly implement.  Update: G1 rolled an event that was actually worth playing so I decided to reinstall. After three hours I can clearly tell that the cheating is out of hand. Each mission in which I participated had at least one gold-threat low-rating player (which indicates a freshly created account) in both teams, running around in newbie clothes kicking everyone's â¥â¥â¥ sky high. Go figure. Plus, old bugs, like the scoreboard bug (players from previous missions in current mission scoreboard, so you can't tell who're you up against) still not fixed. There's just absolutely no fun left in this game what so ever. No engine update is gonna save this burning trainwreck.

10761	1	a	It's a mighty fine game gents. It's fast paced and fun, the downside is that's perma-death but if you're willing to give it a go and get in to it I'm sure you'll like it
3449	1	a	This game is badass to play in multiplayer
6213	0	a	Like GTA 4, but worse, and you can't do any missions because the other players are invincible.
8877	0	a	I love Fallen Earth! So many great memories in this game. I downloaded it in 2012 and deeply regret that I missed its early days. I still play it pretty regularly, but I can't willingly recommend it.   The player base is dwindling due to lack of advertising, non-existent updates, and what seems like complete abandonment from GMs/Devs. Every anniversary that I have in memory was met with a celebration for making another great year! And if you were subscribed you would receive an article of clothing with the game's name, usually. This year, (marking Fallen Earth's seventh) there were only three redeem codes to celebrate it. Just depressing.  I unfortunately can't see a future for this game, if this continues. Recommending Fallen Earth is just letting gamers waste time, effort, and money for a game on its last leg. It pains me to write this because I don't want this game to end, but have no power to change its fate.
6377	0	a	This game is so innapropriet and it's encoureged for younger kids to play it insted of GTA. This game should be removed from steam and never have anything like this again.

10914	0	a	This game is a p2w game or better know as pay to win and I say this because if you dont buy like a rank or anything like that you have to spend countless hours more then if you pay.
4925	0	a	I tried loving it, gave it so many chances but in the end I just cant bring myself to play it anymore
618	1	a	this game is the best â¥â¥â¥â¥ ever it's max competitiv and can make your pant max wet, Sadly fairfight the anticheat system is dumb and noob banning only free cheats or payant cheats with bad seting. it's back in its old state years ago full of trigerbot ,aim bot (smooth) macro and more++++ but beat one of these fakers is a great feel, so APB&gt;all games get on it be patient time=skills in this game don't mind of weird communauty you will get fun as you never has before 8,5/10 CBT VETERAN 21000 hours 143000 kills feel free to contact me in game for help.

1417	1	a	Oh my god, please. Just get the game. 11/10 'Let's Be Bad Guys' Simulator 2014   No but really tho, get it. Sure, weapons can be bought for money, and other people have money and blah blah blibbity blah, but you can get them for free... It's like planetside, but it's cops and robbers. Who the hell doesn't like cops and robbers?!

2765	1	a	I never wanted to play this game.. I wasted my life.  10/10
5868	0	a	What a clunky, frustrating, and really boring game. Since the game began, there have only been 2 core city maps. Decent sizes but full of really boring and useless things to do. So you do missions endlessly. Now to the game's credit, when you get two teams who are equally balanced and moderately competent, it can be fun. Those moments reminded me of Saints Row 2 multiplayer (RIP). But the method to aquire clothing and guns is such a disgusting grind of blah. The car physics and driving camera are both awful to deal with. The guns are not balanced in the least. The power levels of players and matchmaking is not balanced in the least. Newbs can expect to be the whipping boy for anyone with a decent modded weapon, abilities, and upgrades. THose players get the same for killing a weak newbs as they do an equally matched player... so who do you think they go after all the time? No wonder the game died. There is zero evidence of any kind of non-cosmetic content since launch. The game allows rampant abuses, and creates them with a lack of proper matchmaking, leveled areas, or any mechanism to balance the game in any way.  Go play GTA5 multi... it's vastly superior. APB was an ok idea that set the bar really low for itself and didnt do anything to raise it. The game is still kind of active but new players were constantly being discouraged and leaving due to the buzzards who quite obviously flaunted their unfair advantages at every turn.  Oh wait... APB doesnt care. If you want to actually not get wrecked and not spend 6 months grinding incredibly stupid unlocks you give them money. It's free toplay. No surprises. But it's been out for 8 years. And the level of content available is so insanly limited... oh wait no there are a ton of clothing and ca options if you want to grind it out or pay up... but the gameplayu is still lame, shallow, and lacking any kind of meaningful substance. It blows.  So if you think it looks kind of fun, it can be for a little while until you see all the things that are wrong with it. Then you will wake up and say 'Why am I wasting my time with this when it's 2016 and there are vastly superior but similar experiences to have?'
7546	0	a	Terribly wasted potential. I was in the Beta for this game many years ago, and I even pre-ordered it when it came out. However, after Real Time World went under, and it was picked up again by Reloaded, everything went down the toilet. As said countless times before, the customization is amazing, and I really wish it could see it's full potential. However as we've seen, that's never going to happen.
2847	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ 
8825	0	a	The game USE to be good and full of players a lot like how Payday is. However its no longer the case and the game is dead with really no players and horrible layout. Theres no HUD or mini map, I did like how there was no real story to the game however without any story you don't know the point. I will say this game beats Half Life in terms of ragdoll effect I wish they added cross hairs.
6755	0	a	I was driving my car and a left turn was coming up. I pressed and held A to turn left, and my car continued to drive straight for another 200m and then turned into a pedestrian and crushed them against the wall.  Uninstall simulator 2015 has never been this great!
4970	0	a	I have played APB for a short time, when I first started playing I got gold my first day, I was having fun, but as soon as you hit high ranked servers, you're dead, the game is no longer fun because you can't kill cheaters, or people who are just too good at the game and should stop playing it.   APB's Customization is the best customization I have ever seen in any game, you can design your car the way you want to, you can put anything on it and it's completely up to you. The character customization is also great, I managed to make my character look exactly like Rambo and had a blast doing it.  APB's Gameplay however is not the worst, and not the best I have seen in a game. It seems they have worked more on the things that don't matter as much as they have on things that do. Certain guns need to not be implemented in the game, I enter a gold server, I always get matched with someone that has a rocket launcher and just uses it the entire match, how many rockets does that dang thing have with ammo? If it stays implemented, you should only get 1 rocket per life, you know how much those things weigh? And why is everything that is completely OP only available to higher ranked players? I'm gold with a Shaw with no Mods on it, and they are gold with ANY GUN THEIR HEART DESIRES WITH MAXED MODS ON IT. And you just can't win, somehow they beat an LMG (Shaw) with a pistol. I don't get it, there are no bullet physics in the game, headshots do not matter, the only skill required is to be a troll and lean back and forth behind a wall until you kill someone.  I loved the game at first, but I have learned to hate the game. I have literally played the game for 5 days now and went from loving it to hating it. APB, if you want more players, change. Change what the community wants you to change.  Will NOT play again. 3/10
6595	0	a	wont work just keeps on updating and it takes hell to try to start it
10515	0	a	I've been playing this game for years (even if not through Steam), and I can say that, through time, it has evolved to provide many unique and exciting features: - Severe game balancing issues! Land tons of damage with one class and steal loot from other poor useless players! - No serious updates in years! You can play the same dungeons again, and again and again! And then some more!  - Rampant cheating! And if this doesn't still sell this to you, also know that the company now managing the game, the infamous Kabam, totally ignores cheater reports! - Poisonous community! Scammers? We got those! Leechers? Of course, the game actually encourages leeching! Racial and homophobic insults? Goes without saying! - Pay to win!!! You think you can max your pet without spending real money? Think again!!! And if you don't feel like buying game gold, just check out the black market spambots that make the game chat window completely unusable! - Much, much more!

6508	0	a	A classic example of a P2W (Pay to Win) game. Great concepts, but is just ruined by that one system.   PROS: - Great concept - Quite good graphics - Seems promising at first - Great costumization idea  CONS: - Pretty bad matchmaking - Pay 2 Play system - Unbalanced weapon prices (in the Armas Marketplace) - Server lag - etc.  Overall: 4/10

10559	0	a	Re-downloads game gets on game maintanance on charecter account get wiped 8/8 it gr8 m8 Kabam go kill yourself kthx  EDIT:Apparently this is a bug and is being fixed, I got mine restored.  Kabam you can still kill yourself kthx
2868	1	a	Honestly the ONLY reason i gave this 'Do you recommmend this game?' a *Yes* is because it is good for someone who doesn't own Grand Theft Auto or Saint's Row, *!WARNING!* If you own ANY Grand Theft Auto or Saint's Row game's this is a 1 out of 5 compared to those game's which have a 4 out of 5. also all that is different between the good cop like people and the bad thief's are that they have different vehichle's and clothing. as both the cop and the thief you can steal from place's and even rob people really bad design on their part.   Okay now for the good part of this review.  This game is a extremely good game for the first few day's / hour's if you are a person like me you play it for 30 minutes see you can't actually go in any building and can't really be happy with the story, Anyways, this game has some nice vehichle's *saddly if you want something better then the starting one you have to pay real cash for the awesome one's*  This is honestly just a rip off version of GTA and Saint's Row.
4826	0	a	One of the most unbalanced games I've ever played, and wasted money on, you have pistols that can out damage assault rifles and sniper rifles and if you want a good weapon you got to buy it with real money the ingame weapons they give you are â¥â¥â¥â¥ and this game has a lot of hackers. I can unload in a person with a good rifle and they won't die they hit me 3 times with a smaller gun or pistol I die. This game could be a lot better if it was balanced better and took better care of hackers. I play a lot of game and I'm fine with not being the best and dying now and then but come on, I even see people on the chat in game say how they are just gonna quit the game. I liked the game untill I kept running into the bs in the gameplay.
3031	1	a	I've played APB for about 2 years. I see alot of negative review concerning the game regarding poor matchmaking, bugs, hacking and most of all the community. To be honest I could not see APB nor could I enjoy playing it the same way if it weren't for those things. You are in a game where you can make yourself look however you want. Literally I've seen people walk around gunning people with what looked like underwear with a giant brown stain and a party hat. I've seen people paint masterpieces on the sides of cars and vans alike. I've seen people put so much detail in their characters they stand out no matter what. Everyone stands out somehow. You have your own personal touch that people will recognize. Your shirt, your car, your tie, your makeup or a tattoo. The customization on this game is endless and you can even make your own MIDI songs ingame. Sure they won't be pop quality songs but how many games can do that today in the MMO field?   Matchmaking is good the way it is simply because there are people who are on a higher tier than other players and pick on the newbies. This game is brutal concerning that one detail... Its f*** or die and granted that is sad but this is not a game that will spoon feed you skills nor will it hold your hand till you can walk by yourself. You can't just click a button or two to make your problems disappear. The more you play the more you will understand that it all comes down to two things. Skill and teamwork, with an emphasis on teamwork. The hardest, toughest mother*****r can be killed with teamwork that is guaranteed. However there will be times when its all you under the spotlight vs three other people and only 30 seconds left on the clock to finish the mission... You will probably fail but sometimes you will be able to shine. Once you put such a high bar in a game the satisfaction of winning is increased ten fold.  Now regarding the community... I want everyone for just a moment to understand something. This is a game where you either pretend to be a criminal or a vigilante (neither have a problem killing pedetrians at will). Its also an FPS game with things like 'lootable' money. Also let us not forget this is the internet... Do you really think everyone is gona be nice or play nice? People will insult you, they will hate you, they will bother you, hell if they could they would perma crash all your cars, steal your money and leave you without clothes. However... Every world is the same town, there are good people and there are bad people. I've met decent human being on APB who were not hell bent on defecating on your gaming experience. The community of APB in my mind is exactly how San Pedro would be if such a situation ever existed. Besides I personal find satisfaction being s**t talked by the entire opposition for 30min after I win the game.   To conclude this game is not for everyone and it requires a bit getting used to. If you read this review and decide to give it a shot don't worry about sucking at this game. Even after you become the proest of them all, to someone (or a few people) you will always be a 'noob' ;).  9/10 They don't get my full vote because I'd very much like to see new maps from time to time xD
2570	1	a	If im being completely honest here, it's one of the most exciting games ive ever played. Yes At low levels and if you dont purchase items for the sellers it's quite hard to win missions but even the basic details like driving and looting bring a smile to my face
2984	1	a	This is the best closest thing to gta 5 for pc that there is 
3417	1	a	cool game austin should get it
6196	0	a	this game has a lot of potential, sadly the developers are too â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ to get their â¥â¥â¥â¥ together and instead of fixing broken things just release more cashshop crap to get money.  cashgrab/10 would not recommend even to my mortal enemy.
1510	1	a	Much lag much fps drops..... If fps were good it would be 10 but with that its 7
7871	0	a	This really is a poor game. The sheer difficulty of leveling up without paying is just unbelievable. Matches are unbalanced; I was often put against high level players despite being new to the game. Furthermore, the ammount of things you have to pay for just to get certains skins and modifications makes this one of the worst freemiums out there. Car choice is rubbish, the weapons system is very poor, you have to pay per week to own even the most basic guns and the lack of servers means sometimes I simply couldn't join. What an awful, awful game.  2/10

2633	1	a	APB: Reloaded was probally one of the best F2P games I have played, but like with every other game hackers found a way in for a long time now. Theres been a lot more recently too, but APB has given me one of the best expriences in gaming in a long time. People claim that this game is Pay To Win, when if you pay you just pay to get the item faster nothing more nothing less. APB is an amazingly fun game, if you get a match without hackers that is. Although there is an abnormal amount of bugs in it that NEED to be fixed. But, overall APB is really fun and I reccomend it.
10333	1	a	If you like apocolypse type games, this one is great. IF you like CRAFTING! THIS is the best game ever for it. well close enough. XD
8016	0	a	Great consept. Poor execution. Repetertive, clumsy, dosn't 'capture' the mmo-feeling, not the most interesting world. Milking the cow.
4793	0	a	I thought I'd give this game a try after hearing about it via word of mouth.   One element that I love, is the character customization and being able to design unique outfits with the designer mode and the player/map interaction. I've only tried playing as a criminal character so far but honestly as a new player I've found it next to impossible to win gunfights and get kills, whether that's due to hackers or not I'm not sure because on numerous occaisions I've scored multiple hits on players and they haven't gone down, yet I get taken down almost every time with only a few shots.   It's not newbie friendly by any means and I'm pretty sure the matchmaking doesn't work at all, everyone I go up against seem to be much more experienced, their clothing designs are a giveaway since you get next to nothing early on. The game itself is also very laggy and vehicle controls are absolutely horrible &amp; unresponsive as vehicle steering also seems to be linked with mouse movement.  To summarize, it's not an enjoyable game for new players and is not one I'd consider spending any real money on since the developers don't seem to be all that engaged with the players, nor fixing obvious flaws with the game &amp; actively dealing with hackers IG.

503	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game
301	1	a	fun game and it's free plus people just to let ya'll know it's preety much a pay to play cause most of the weapons u have to buy with real money and if u don't most would be like 10 or 90 days that u can have it soo yea theres that just play it

2923	1	a	APB is what GTA should of been. Best of all, it's completely free.
10643	0	a	Don't get me wrong, at the early stages of this game it was great fun to run around with your friends, loot, clear dungeon, and kill Oryx. However, since late 2013 when Kabam came to ownership the game became extremly P2P. If you want to ever get anywhere in the game you have to buy multiple character and vault chests so that you have backup characters and loot. Vault chests only hold 8 items and cost 5 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dollars a piece. Aswell as making most legendery loot hard as â¥â¥â¥â¥ to obtain, they took out trading of UT items, So once you get the legendary loot if its not for your class you're SOL. My reccomendation is to avoid playing this until Kabam lifts their P2P hammer.
1966	1	a	Great!
8575	0	a	Imagine this if you can:  A hot pile of dog faeces.  That's it's.
6329	0	a	 This game is a poor mans Saints Row; full of hackers and idiots online. Also a Pay-To-Win, so anyone who hacks/pays real money for guns has a total advantage over average players. Driving any vehicle is delayed by a fraction of a second so getting used to turning/steering is plain retar**d. The customization of vehicles is honestly one of the best I've ever seen in any game so that's ONLY what it's good for. If you're cheap then play it, otherwise don't be a cheap as*hole and buy Saints Row.  2/10
2757	1	a	A game that is worth playing
8272	0	a	People with premium weapons usually win this game. noobs get matched against experienced players constantly. Overall, not a very good f2p game
8626	0	a	Bad optimization, has a lot of bugs and the Dev's don't fix them Countlessly,shity server couldn't keep up  the DEV No communication, lies and not listening to the community  DON'T PLAY THIS GAME! Atleast not now. It as been release more then 6 years ago, and its sill in alfa '-' GG WP G1 :)
4625	0	a	A great concept poorly implemented. A company that cares more about your money than it does about fixing or developing it's game. Childish toxic community. Hackers hackers hackers.
3191	1	a	This game has a good idea about it but they need to sort out the level difference in lobbys 
3502	1	a	Awsome Game, but It is hard to get cars
3806	0	a	It's decent, but it takes a special person to be able to tolerate all the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t this game can produce. It's fun, if you're willing to try to get good at the game.

8576	0	a	I take â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ that are better than this game...
2042	1	a	You respond to flash points or crimes in progress, and complete vital Enforcer operations, keeping the city under tight control. Rewards are paid automatically. Vehicles, weapons and equipment are at your disposal, but as a private citizen, these must be purchased from your own funds. How you choose to look is your own affair. At all times, you must be ready to use lethal or non-lethal force against Criminal insurgents, as authorized in the terms of your license.  Your authority comes straight from the Mayor herself.  San Paro is at war. Protect your city. Now get out there and â¥â¥â¥â¥ up some Crims!
2967	1	a	Its fun when you have someone to play with.
2622	1	a	While the character creator, theme song composer and the car/tattoo/clothing/logo customisation is top-notch, the lack of a true PvE venue of advancement might be a turnoff for some fans of traditional well rounded MMO experiences. If you love MMOs mainly for the PvP and competitive aspect however, then this is a really solid modern setting title that has decent replay value.  I reccomend you grab a friend before heading out on the town, it is easy to get overwhelmed quickly without some backup!

890	1	a	Pay2Win in a nutshell. The game has a magnificant concept but it has been executed terribly. You can't stand up against people who have paid for the game in both customization and actual PvP. However, the games funny physics and hilarious outfits, it surely does bring a few laughs, especially when you group up with a pair of buddies. It's an incredibly fun game aslong as you have a fair game, and if you don't mind paying for a game to have fun, this is recommended - Aslong as you got a good enough computer to handle it!
10260	1	a	Definitely the best game you don't have to buy.  Fallout Simulator to the max.  That being said......it is amazing, and it is addictive. Even more fun when you meet new friends to help you with quests!
7088	0	a	Game is dying and horrible. Got 7 different max ranks over 5 years, over 10,000 hours. Game is just dead.
5551	0	a	I would love to play it...if I could play it.
1798	1	a	This game really deserves more players, it's good hyper-blasting cop-killing, crime stopping fun.  there are flaws but it's still great fun with friends  8/10
3633	1	a	Great game but there's a lil delay when turning
4663	0	a	When you first start out, it's kinda unfair, start a mission and boom, in the game with higher ranked players with basically OP weapons... People kill you in less than 3-4 hits.  How can this be fair to a new player? Now I wonder why it had mixed reviews.
10899	1	a	Really interesting game. 8 bit Bullet hell style game that will just keep you entertained for hours. So many unlockable classes will have you going til you finally face off against Oryx.
9321	0	a	It's exactly as if they took all the bad parts and mechanics of fallout and packed it into a game.
10887	1	a	OH MY GOD, THE RAGE!!!
3706	1	a	Basically the entirety of this game:         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  nwa â¥â¥â¥â¥ the police hq&nbsp;
3293	1	a	This is a game of shooting, driving and sometimes getting angry.  It has a learning curve and sometimes will put you up against tough opposition which feels noticable but if you've played BF2 or similar multiplayer you'll spend the same amount of time getting killed before you get used to it.  The community is made of 'u mad bro' â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ rejects and as such its best played with a few mates.  Customisation is massive and worth playing with. Spary your car. Dress and alter yourself and your clothes. You can also compose tunes to play when people die.  Worth trying, but worth knowing that it takes some time to get in to it.
31	1	a	I've decided to revise my recommendation.   This game is fun.... When you're winning, when you're losing you really just want to â¥â¥â¥â¥ing murder and â¥â¥â¥â¥ the other team.   Be prepared to get called names like: hacker, noob, buy weapon â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, macro â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, wallhacker, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ucker, neckbeard virgin, no-life unemployed â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, rich â¥â¥â¥ whitekid (guess that's an insult now?), ponyfag, genderbendending-â¥â¥â¥â¥-sucking-ultramega-â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥-â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
7610	0	a	APB:reloaded.... i simply dont like this game, everything, EXACTLY everithing MUST BE PAY2WIN, also the missions are bad. this is my personal opinion btw... if you like open world but hate p2w (pay2win) then simply dont download this game.
5420	0	a	My first impression of the game was filled with annoyance and hate. Walked around enjoying the wonderful city, it was great. Seeing tons of people run around was nice. Then when i start or attempth to start a mission, thats when things got from nice to extremely bad. I was going to mission points like normal, thinking what rewards id get finishing it. Then i died cause some idiot sniped me for no reason, i say ok. Then as i attempth to do the mission again. Someone runs me over with an ambulance, thinking it might just be bored players i waitted for a day or two. Then when i try the mission again dead, this pattern repeated itself none stop. So... I uninstalled the game and said 'Yup, i'm done with this.' so i quit the game.   APB gets a final score of 0.5/10   (Should have a lower score, but i enjoyed what little there is the game has to offer but expirience wise. I didn't enjoy it one bit, too many people killing you. No PvE mechanics, seems to cater to the people that just kills new players for no reason, and this is why it gets this score.)  The graphics is fairly decent, nothing over the top eyecandy. Sound is so-so, and gets boring. Gameplay is extremely bad to extremely poor (Too many Annoying people.)  This game is only for those people with no respect for other peoples prefference of playing nice and slow. Casual players avoid this game, go play something else.

9797	0	a	I played it. Got renamed to a ridiculous name because my name offended the you know who. Then the same mod who had renamed me popped up in main chat to ask people to keep the discussion to game related Q&amp;A. I wasnt even chatting at the time, and the people who were were simply chit chatting. Apparently this is too much for this concentration camp of a game. No fun allowed. Only talk about the game.  I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hate this â¥â¥â¥â¥. Burn down every game company that manages its users like stupid cattle. God forbid giving personal details or talking about fun stuff. It might create you know, DISCUSSION. We dont want that. We want stupid morons who only talk about the game and pay their dues. Die. Eat it and die.
2080	1	a	It's good, but there is a pay2win aspect, but you can overcome such. It's pretty fun, and there are events where you can gain items that you'd usually pay for therefore lowering the pay2win ratio.
10399	1	a	Best first person/ third person mmorpg action pact awesomeness that you will find on the net. Pvp game play is real fun and the crafting system is one of the most complex i have ever seen check it out.
6250	0	a	ok .  It look's nice in the pictures . But don't even try it . It dosen't even want to â¥â¥â¥â¥ing load . I mean rly .  It takes ages for the damn screen to pop up . and when it dose 'not responding'
471	1	a	If you like hackers, getting owned by people with more experience and bandits vs cops, then this game is for you.
7670	0	a	This is the absolute WORST FPS I've ever played.... you're reading the introductory text (ie., you don't even know the movement keys yet) and get slaughtered in the spawn area by some APB Troll.... then he thinks he's so funny that he does it another 20 times.  If I paid for this game, I'd be â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. As it is, I'll simply uninstall it and go back to Combat Arms.
5891	0	a	Not really good. I thought this was going to be like a gta but foer pc and free. it is. the aspects are great but i find the game unplayable due to the fact that it takes a second for the game to register that you pressed a button.
10689	1	a	Pixel artsy bullet hell top down shooter. One of the most frantic bullet hell shooters out there. Despite the large P2W themes, I believe that you can easily earn your way up, with a small amount of panicked grinding. Even the grinding is frantic, as once you die, YOU LOSE EVERYTHING.  Both pleasure and pain, I highly reccomend this game.
118	1	a	If you ever want to play a game of 4 man squad base rolling out and hitting up on them fools. This will be the game for you. Also you get to create your own character and watch as it grow. But don't get too attach to the people who play in this game. There are alot of scammer and a lot of whom out to get what they want. Guns are buyable and also achieve through getting grind for ingame money and buy it on the ingame market. Its a fun 3rd person games to play for down time because its an open world. The method you use to win can be conventional/unconventional. You change guns and tactic accordingly to scenario.   This is a game for fast thinker and master mind tactician. Its like a chess. When all things come together.... its really is a games not to be missed.
3329	1	a	The game just wont work. I downloaded this for gamerfirst then steam....none work. Please tell me how to fix this.

7503	0	a	All Points Bulletin: Reloaded is a game that invokes many feelings. Off the top of my head, I can name relentless rage, grueling dissapointment, and cocky pride worthy of a guy that just â¥â¥â¥â¥ed Ariana Grande.  APB is a great concept. The backstory behind it is very deep, and the entire caracterization of the city of San Paro(however unoriginal that name might be) is very detailed and well done. It doesn't draw black and white lines: it's all a thick mist of grey, and it certainly asks you a question: are the oftentimes corrupt, control-obsessed vigilantes right? Or is it ethically correct to leave the city to the self-proclaimed renegades and anarchists, however chaotic and destructive they might be?  Remember, I'm talking about the CONCEPT here.  Because the realization of said concept is about as clear as a snowstorm in the deep ocean. The backstory and personality of the contacts and city is only presented by tedious text, mainly in the form of emails that most people just delete, or don't even bother to open. I even asked a friend, that has 20 hours clocked in the game, what the Enforcers were: he thought they were just straight-up police officers. That's just how bad the story is brought to the player.  Now for the gameplay. The core is good: Reloaded Productions managed to deliver a good third-person shooter, with interesting weapons and playstyles. The smart player that uses tactics will more often than not have an advantage over the kid that has spent countless dark nights crouched in front of his PC playing Call Of Duty, while perfecting his aim and surviving on Red Bull and Cheetos. However, like almost everything in this King Kong-sized dissapointment, this is ruined by two reasons:  1: The lag. Oh god, the lag. Unless the monthly cost for the servers is 3 bucks plus a cute picture of a cat, I cannot possibly wrap my head around how bad they are. Driving feels like standing on one foot. On a stick. Which is balancing on a banana held by a blind monkey with Parkinson. Often, during a unexpected encounter with a hostile player in the back alleys of the Financial District, I have either died because half of my shots didn't register, or I have won because my opponent's gun wasn't raised-which is a clear indication that some serious lags are going on.  2: The players. Sadly, the smart tactician is a long extinct species in San Paro, and the streets are now ruled by people such as 'Pu$$ySlayer69', 'lole_u_got_buttâ¥â¥â¥â¥ed' and 'UMAD BRAH??11?'. I am seriously not â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ you right now, I have seen all three of these names ingame.  Dare to be good, and you'll be called a dirty hacker. Dare to be even slightly worse than either your teammates or your opponents, or equip a weapon they dislike, and you'll be called n00b, â¥â¥â¥, and come to the realization that most of these people have had sexual intercourse with your mother, or that they wish you to do the same.  There are quite some topics I haven't covered, such as the hackers, which constitute, based on other people's calculations, 9,7% of the players. An alarming number, but hard to confirm, so I will leave it there. There is also the company known as GamersFirst. Sadly, these people seem to identify 'Gamer' as 'Man with a lot of money and no need for a honorable fight'. For excruciating prices, you can buy certain weapons that will shred through any average player. (Note that I'm not saying all of them are OP: a decent chunk are either reskins, or equally powerful as the in-game weapons.) The excuse 'you can get it in game too' is true, because you DO unlock modifications and bonuses as you go, but I myself have clocked over a hundred hours and all I got was a useless magazine mod and a slight increase to marksman zoom.  The customization is unrivalled, though. I have tried to find a game, ANY game, that has better character creation or vehicle customization, but to no avail. Shame, because this pearl just had to be incrusted in the (mostly) dried up turd that is APB.  TL;DR: APB: Reloaded is a great concept, that was insufficiently realized by Reloaded Productions, and completely â¥â¥â¥â¥ on by GamersFirst, after they took over the game. You could of course take a look, because, hey, it's free, but greedy business ideals have screwed over the concept so bad that the game is now singing it's dying song.
2995	1	a	its a good game and dont argue thats a p2w game because if you do it right you preaty mutch have the same gumes

7725	0	a	What a waste of HDD space. Stay far, FAR away from this game.
1600	1	a	The best mmofps game ever, really.  I agree to people saying 'game is ptw blah blah blah' BUT there are a lot of weapons already to choose which works very good, just you need skills, TBH didnt play this game for 1 year, then downloaded and i still had skill to be on top with 40 kills in a mission lol.  Matchmaking is really â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥, there are always people matched in groups which has everything maxed out... This game would be the best if it didnt have threats... No gold, bronze or silver, because of this matchmaking is â¥â¥â¥â¥, there must be only one order of ranks, like csgo, has and other mmo games.  Game is really competetive, and as i said, its the best one you will ever find as mmo fps as you can drive a car do some crazy stuff. I am running on pretty old pc sure using some low settings, but game is still having some laggs even people says that on even a gaming pc this game would lag, and im waiting for an update for engine... so yeah. Devs should look more into quality not into money.

142	1	a	Yo. I'm a real thug freal ma negros, and this game just brought about bad memories. One time I was flying around in my direct replica of my own personal drug dealing van and i saw this kid. his name was masterrapist59xXZeldaFanXx and he wasn't joking about his name. His knowledge of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Zelda was out of this world. But then it hit me: my friend's car. It broke both ma legs and then he honked his horn at me for hours and hours, but I refused to leave, for I am the dominant male. Then I went and begged mhy mommy for money so I could get a permanent gun. She said 'YOOOOO CUT IT' and stabbed me in the stomach for the second time this week.
8782	0	a	I like this game quite a lot, which is why I have 258.4 hours in it, but I can't recommend it becuase it uses the worst anti cheat known to man. We mortals merely call it 'punkbuster' this god awful invention is believed to date back to Soviet times where Soviet scientists were thinking what the best way to ruin the western games market was. They decided that the absolutely best way was to make a anti-cheat so horrible that it kicks random people off server, aswell as scan your files when you are not even on the game. So in summary great game but uses anti-cheat developed by the soviets to troll gamers.
412	1	a	Great game, dont know why everyone gives it thumbs down? me and my mate downloaded the game played it for 4 hours and loved every minute, personally i would reccomend being a cop :) 
3112	1	a	Absolutely Love this game, takes combat to a whole new level.
9939	1	a	This game offers lots to do for mmo gamers at every level. The maps are large and look the part. Enemies vary to keep things interesting and generally fit in their environment on the map. Crafting is a HUGE part of this game and can be time consuming but it is done in a way that players can queue up tasks for offline time. Character can be built with skills chosen by the player and customized to fit playstyle. Quests are available in the game but are optional.  Personally the crafting element of the game is my favorite. It brings together the need to scavenge and find the parts you need to craft to advane further into the game.  If you enjoy a sandbox mmo that doesn't marshal you through it's world from start to finish and you enjoy the genre, I would recommend trying this game.  (This review is based off playtime from before the game was offered on Steam, I just recently switched to the Steam version)

1950	1	a	Love the limitless customization. But the community is not really good due idling the newbie. No pay to win, In-game weapon still can killng the enemy. But the only problem is when the higher rank player get a better gear and shooting you all time.
7786	0	a	Played this game within the first week it came out but quit less than an hour into it because it was simply too laggy to play. Tried playing it again earlier today and it's still too laggy to play. I have a decent spec computer and 100mbit internet.  My suggestion is to avoid the extreme load times and stuttering frames and laggy glitches by not installing this piece of garbage.
522	1	a	10/10 To much time wasted on here to invest in something productive, like taking a â¥â¥â¥â¥.
5522	0	a	Fun untill you loose Premium ;_;  Im not paying for that.
7948	0	a	This game might have been better, I like the idea, I think it has potential, but the studio simply cannot deliver it in a suitable form to players. This might have been better if the weapons were more 'balanced' (in the form of not having shotguns that don't work after 12m), and the 'premium' shop is filled with reskins (of free weapons) and overpriced cosmetics.
2517	1	a	this game is off the roof when it comes to multiplayer, i would honestly recommend this to anyone who wants constant MMORPG, TPS*, and lots of fun!!! it's like GTA, but 1000000% MORE AWESOME!!
812	1	a	Okay, I like this game so I'm gonna list the pros and cons:  Pros. Good graphics Smooth car handling Easy to start You can be in groups  Cons. Servers shut down frequently BlingLords with over 9000 rank try to blow/gun you down any chance they get (these people can only do this if they're in a different faction) A tiny bit confusing
4860	0	a	Its a pretty bad made game it crashes from 10 to 10 minutes :(
1717	1	a	7/10 Love the game i really do, but i am a pretty competitive player and the pvp, is pretty rageful. I mean you can expect a free to play game to also be pay to win, they gotta make money somehow and honestly i would rather the game be $20 then to have people with OP weapons killing you extremely fast. Im glad there is a bronze silver and gold ranked pvp system but there are still the players with better weapons. Now instead of complaining about the cons i would like to lastly say THE CUSTOMIZING of this game is seriously amazing.(the pvp brought the game to a 7/10)
9162	0	a	I downloaded it longer then i played it.....crit. 14/10
779	1	a	this is a fun game you go around and shoot ppl stell cars play as a cop or a crook XD its pirtty fun sorda reminds me of gta :D hope some of u guys get it glhf :D
3455	1	a	Yes it totally Worth it For Free
9768	0	a	It needs more fixing!
2766	1	a	uuuuh I played dis game, I think it was about the old childhood classic 'Cops and Robbers'
9898	1	a	itÂ´s a good game, a bit difficult the further into the game you get. However, some obstacles have not stopped anyone from trying until you passed it. Any good gamer can agree.
10290	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥
2856	1	a	Cool game :)
4367	0	a	This game is kinda like GTA, just not as polished, big or open-ended. Or....well okay it's not really like GTA at all, apart from you roam around shooting people and stealing cars. Battles are fought in a series of urban maps between two sides, Enforcers and Criminals.  The game has a really, really good character creation and customization system. You really can do so much, height and weight, facial structure, skin tone, moles and scars and all sorts. Clothes are the same, able eventually to be worn in a multitude of colors, with lots of different styles.  The bad points, IMHO, outweigh the good however. The community on this game is absolutely atrocious. Exploititive, foul-mouthed keyboard gangsters constantly filling the district chat with all manner of nasty comments and what is essentially verbal griefing. I can't really stress how awful this community is.  The second worst feature is the driving and combat. Cars are horribly unwieldy and slip and slide like you're driving on an ice rink. The combat is very annoying, as you -will- be destroyed by bouncing, aimbotting 'veterans' with P2W guns that you simply cannot match unless you want to fork out quite a large amount of money. The gunfights are not fun. They really on having suprise and killing within three seconds, any longer and the hyper accurate, ultra-damage gun wielding other players will kill you with suspicious accuracy.  I don't recommend this game at all. The community is a festering, weeping sore that is hopelessly entrenched, and the gameplay is either clunky or skewed horribly in the favour of pay-to-win veterans who scream gangster hood references over the chat at eachother while aimbotting and hacking the game. Avoid.  Not worth even being free.
5460	0	a	glitched my account
9438	0	a	Its pretty awful
3175	1	a	spent all my money on cars
5632	0	a	Game is awful. Driving I discovered is awful and I only played for 10 minutes before finding it awful.
7738	0	a	I really want to recommend this game, because there's so many things about it that are great, but overall it's just been way too hard to have an enjoyable experience with it.  The thing is that while the game has a lot of really cool systems to it, the massive amount of customization options, the GTA-style MMO gameplay, the massive potential for fun included in playing the game with friends, it's all entirely offset by the fact that the game's matchmaking is complete garbage. Four times out of five, you're matched up against opponents that are -way- higher rank than you, and often have weapons that far outclass yours, simply because they've paid a few bucks. This game completely embodies the 'pay-to-win' problem that a lot of Free to Play games encounter, and it's a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ shame. When you're in a matchup against a guy who's more than five times your rank, and can kill you with three shots even if you've gotten the jump on him first, then what's even the point?
611	1	a	10/10 game never gets boring i recomend u guys play it
10245	1	a	not bad..weird as â¥â¥â¥â¥ but not bad,game is kind of confusing only complaint so far at two hours into it
5736	0	a	To be honest i haven't played the game in a while but i just re-installed to see what has changed but other than that the game was good, I used to play it alot then the game just went downhill and I uninstalled. It is also very pay to win.
7754	0	a	Doesn't even launch, no point in getting. So many people have had this issue, waste of almost 5 total GB
3229	1	a	I'm McLovin this games ! Once. Been a long while since I login. Gettin n00b. I will be back. Much customization in games and fun gameplay. One of the best customize I ever encounter. Need a good teamwork or frens to truly enjoy the games though.
1545	1	a	I can not start it op and they say its Running always :( 
553	1	a	This game is awesome
6017	0	a	The game lags like crazy. The graphics in the game are way lower quality than showcased in the trailers. And also its impossible to find objsctives as there are no waypoint markers.
2922	1	a	Go ahead punk, make my d- OH GOD HE'S PAYING TO WIN, HELP!
1264	1	a	A new gen GTA....well guys give it a shot!
4638	0	a	It's probably one of the worst games I've ever had the misguided pleasure to play.Terrible community, bad game mechanics, that sort of stuff. But it's strangely addicting the first time around, so you keep playing and playing, even though you know its absolute garbage. I can't explain it really. It's like bad drugs or cigarettes, its â¥â¥â¥â¥ for you but you keep coming back.   Overall: Best game I ever had the pleasure of uninstalling.
7593	0	a	This game is run by Gamersfirst, which should be named GamersLast.  It bans ppl for no reason and take away G1C. Worst part is, you can't do anything about. There used to a place where you can submit a ticket and complain, but they removed that....  SO bottom line.... if you play this game, and get to a higher level...you should expect to get banned like legit gamers like us.  Don't waste your time and money on Gamersfirst...
2816	1	a	APB Reloaded is a very unique game in certain ways. Even though it may have low critic acclaim, it is very similiar to Grand Theft Auto, with fun car and gun play, infinite customization and tonnes of side-quests. This 3rd-person, sandbox, action multiplayer is a must get as it is free and quite simple to download. My Rating: 7.5/10
9516	1	a	Extremely like fallout, really long, few bugs but its fine.
7509	0	a	bad and very hard to see whats going on
7372	0	a	worst game ever 0/10 would not furfunkle
353	1	a	This is a must! The best action mmo game i've ever tryed. Try it! :D You can fully customize your player and vehicle etc.. Of course there is some bugs and annoying players. But it's a great game! Try it. i've spend many hours on this! :p
10924	1	a	i cant play this game cause im bad

2929	1	a	One of the best MMO Third-Person FPSs that are out there! You are separated into criminals and enforcers, a.k.a. the police. It is basically GTA with all the epic car explosions, absolute chaos in the streets around every corner, and co-op mission style based to achieve all objectives before the other team. It is a must try game! :D
5211	0	a	THIS GAME IS â¥â¥â¥â¥ I REPEATED THE SAME THING 5 TIMES IN A ROW HAD TO DOWNLOAD 4GB WORTH OF UPDATES PLEASE FIX. AND BY THE WAY YOUR GAME IS â¥â¥â¥â¥ 
2681	1	a	this game is awesome! love the Customization in it, and its just really fun driving around as a cop :D lol!! highly recomend ^_^
7913	0	a	p2w so hard, however I wouldn't even recommend this to you p2w kids cause the people not paying are hackers. the little bit that's untainted by the greed of the first 2 groups is broken or just not good. has the potential to be awesome but it's not gonna happen
8574	0	a	Maybe itll get better when it gets on console but now,bad
844	1	a	LOVE IT 
6006	0	a	AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO CANT GET THIS GAME TO LOAD? &gt;:[
2025	1	a	Makes me wanna flip off myself for installing it
6867	0	a	This is a 'freemium' game. It's free, but you have to pay for the good â¥â¥â¥â¥ to win
3815	0	a	This game has been consistently made worse over the past ~year, with the biggest problems being ignored in favor of introducing more 50$ 'content' of questionable quality.  Avoid.
5422	0	a	my buddy ol pal keeps â¥â¥â¥â¥ing asking me to play..... i dont like this game
5378	0	a	This game, is pretty great. 'Why the thumbs down then?' Hold up. Im getting there. So I heard about this game from a friend and it was free so I was like, hey its free so why not? Well it was pretty awesome at first. Then I actually got into the game, and it was SO. VERY. LAGGY. I don't know if its just me, but it was REALLY, REALLY laggy. Though, when I did get to play it with minimal lag, it was pretty great. Though the missions tended to get a bit repetative. Other than that gamebreaking lag it was great.
5331	0	a	so I downloaded this game and it says it's running when I never even opened it. I even tried to uninstall and to get my task manager to stop it. Nothing helped. never even got to try out the game..
8120	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ 0.50/10
1752	1	a	Would be an AMAZING game if there were no hackers.
10433	1	a	pretty badass if you ask me 
4252	0	a	'Game of the Year' - 1/10 - IGN
8790	0	a	Game used to be fun. I've been a player since about 2013. Got some ups and down, but it was mostly fun. Today, as I come back to play with my friend and wait for the upcoming halloween event, I get perma banned for 'breaking the terms and service'. How can someone break the rules of the game if they haven't played in 3 months? Really sad as this game was really fun, and they are now banning innocent players for others crimes.
1093	1	a	Tons of fun, once you get past the learning curve and actually understand the game its awesome. Recommended to play with friends.
7480	0	a	When I first started playing this game, I thought this game was interesting. But after about a few weeks of play the terrible gun balancing finally got me. You can manage to get kills with your starter equipment with serious metagame startegy, but the whole fool your enemy thing can go wrong quickly when they spot you trying to sneak up on them. So, I bought some of the in-game currency weapons. I still didn't stand a chance to the people who bought from the Arma Marketplace. The only thing that kept me going for longer than I should was the customization, you can customize almost anything of yours. That is the only thing I can complement about this game. Serious Pay To Win.
1874	1	a	Pay2win. It's kinda fun despite that, though this is terribly optimized. Play it only if your computer is &lt;2 yr old.
4940	0	a	its a gta ripoff and like most free to play games you have to create a second acount somewhere else to play it 
3119	1	a	If you can aim at all, prepare to be called a hacker after killing a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ off white kid
10860	1	a	Hours and Hours of Fun. Its really hard and one life is all you get so becareful what you do or you will lose all your stuff. And its free to play so you can't go wrong there.
2945	1	a	Not the best shooter around, mostly pay to win because of the wepons ect. But still has an amazing customization option and gives you the chance to create your own thug/hero.  6/10.
2456	1	a	I wish it was a Mac Os game also.
6476	0	a	If you don't spend money you wont have a chance
10054	1	a	Stumbled on this game and decided to try it out. It's a fairly outdated graphics system, understandably as it's an older game, but it's still very much intriguing from the start, if you can get past the graphics (some people demand more with our current tech these days, and nothing wrong with that.) Anyhow, the style of gameplay is fun and keeps you busy, while the maxed out players online I've often found to be quite helpful. The downfall to the community thing, is that there's hardly one left from what I've seen. I'm cool with that though. I have fun solo or with the occasional team mates. It's open world and fully explorable, with all kinds of weapon/armor upgrades and crafting involved. Basically like a dumbed down red dead redemption meets morrowind meets MMO. It's cool, worth the download, especially since it's f2p. 8/10
4943	0	a	The phtos and videos you see make it look a lot better than it really is, and what would make this game better would be: You dont loose all your money when you die, no noobs, no spawn killing, no pros in the recruit area, more cops, less criminals, less competiotion, rid of team betrayal when you're not ready and most of all clothes. Like, who wants to mug 48 people for a plain hat? COME ON! If you die once, you start again. Horrid game. If all this was changed, i'd re-install it... but nobody ever reads these things.
6855	0	a	This game was the best ive ever played until they started rolling out the Pay to Wins thats when everything went to â¥â¥â¥â¥. i means really the matching making was horrible. people blatantly hacking, and the server lags. with the so much money they get on this game they choose not to fix it. i tried to tell them on facebook but they block me from commenting on anything they post. i guess they dont want to hear a fan of the game opinion about their game. i would have recommended this game in a heartbeat but now its just a Pay to Win Simulator
155	1	a	They have improved it alot, the game is quite fun, not a game to play for too long in a row but its a game you would stick to for such a long time ^^ 
663	1	a	Many lag, much anger, so mystery, wow!
5404	0	a	THE GAME WAS HORRIBLE IT WAS A DISCRACE TO ALL GAMES AND IS ANOTHER RIP OFF OF GTA
7640	0	a	dont even bother, the devs are milking this game for every micro transaction its worth and then some.
9726	0	a	Gamersfirst, just what is this company? They are a company who 'buys' games from other companies. They are a company who believes that editing out original authors of game developers is okay. Their game known as Fallen Earth is great; however, the Game Masters of the game are corrupt. For the past few years Fallen Earth has been suffering from multiple pvp aimbotters/duplicaters and many more glitchers/exploiters, and what do they GAME MASTERS do? 'NOTHING' They believe that banning innocent players for no reason is the key, accepting bribes from known aimbotters/cheaters and other sources in order for players who are 'legit' get banned. It's wrong and outrageous and I believe that these Game Masters need to get what they deserve 'FIRED'. Tiggs and Dasterd both do this, sure sure, they are well known the gaming community, well maybe they should of thought about this before accepting money to ban legit gamers. Due to this, I give Fallen Earth a +1 for being a good game and a -9 for the Game Masters behavior. In conclusion, this game has received yet another 'Negative' review and Gamersfirst should be more cautious as to who they hire.
8453	0	a	Couldn't even get the game to start on Steam. Downloaded it off the official website and it took, like, 15 minutes after clicking start to actual boot up the game. Once I got it going it was nothing but laggy, even when I dropped the quality to the lowest it would go it. Not worth the effort.
9574	1	a	This is a Question for the people that made Fallen Earth. I love this but i cant it somehow. I love this game a lot and please respond people that this game.Please.
7366	0	a	so I'll play the game wtih no problems what so ever. then i'll try to play it again and it'll say that a file is missing and the game can't start. i fun when i can actually play it, but because of this problem, i do not recomend this game until there is a fix.
3684	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing play it. No really, Play it.
8422	0	a	When i click play on steam it dosnt even turn on so i go on task manager to close it and it dose or at least it says it dose, and steam still says that its running so please dont bother with it.
3126	1	a	why can't this game ever be good? 
3899	0	a	I really like how each person can be either a police or a criminal and complete certain tasks and missions TOGETHER! Unfortunately, not a lot of people play this game. I wouldn't recommend you this game unless you play with your friends. Playing alone with random people is pretty boring after a while.
9704	0	a	can't even login.
10293	1	a	Great Game, could use a little reboot and the system is a little old, so its good just has a lack of detail.
10907	1	a	This game is super fun if you want to just kill random things in the world! You fight bosses and their minions! This game is super fun!
3521	1	a	This game is no doubt pay to win(and its really not cheap), however u can have lots of fun even without paid items. Most of the free guns sucks if you compare them to the paid ones, but you can still kill people with them quite easily.  PVP system in game is nicely done, its not boring at all, lots of action and blowing stuff up. Matchmaking is a little bit unbalanced, although it depends on what players are currently on server and what players are ready for a match. Sometimes it gets annoying if your enemies have paid 400k euro for guns without recoil.   Marketplace is one of the best things in this game, u can sell your 'artworks' to other players or buy stuff from other players, you can also buy there paid items for money you earn in game, but its really expensive (its obtainable, but it takes time)    The 'creation' systems is really well made, u can make basically everything in it (your logos, emotes, artworks), then put it at your clothing or on your kickass car. The customization in this game is just GLORIOUS. Characeter creator is really really good, you can make some serious stuff there, if you know what i mean xD  I strongly reccomend you to buy a premium, its worth it, you will be able to make more complicated paterns, clothing etc.
3363	1	a	i want to play this but it wont function even though i meat the minimal requirements
10142	0	a	NAFF game, best to play Fallout 3, or something else, but not this, read other reviews for more indepth stuff.
7140	0	a	It doesn't work for me so it won't for u because i have best computer. PC MASTER RACE.
6551	0	a	Hate Weapons that Expires!!
7981	0	a	People with premium weapons usually win this game. noobs get matched against experienced players constantly. Overall, not a very good f2p game
5019	0	a	oh my god I play this â¥â¥â¥â¥ at 16-20 fps and I'm so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing good at it  but this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥  don't download it  pls.
8066	0	a	there needs to be more added to the streets because they look so empty and i dont think it would be too hard to add stuff as to fill the streets. i think that they should bring out a update to do with the graphics needing to be re-done.. come on its comeing to 2016 there are alote of games that have better graphics and that are free as well.
1255	1	a	good a bit buggy but worth the while 9/10
411	1	a	Cannot kill because everybody is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ with pay to win. 10/10
6554	0	a	Don't play this game unless you want to create a bond with it to only play this game and no others. This game is EXTREMELY unabalanced. No matter what weapon you pick the 'pay to win' weapons will ALWAYS outclass you. SMG's are unbalanced as they can shoot from long ranges and still maintain accuracy, and those are SECONDARY weapons. Essentially just pay for a SMG and a Rocket Launcher and then nothing can stop you. The only fun part of this is the music making. I wouldn't call this game pay to win because that would give it some decency. This game will make you it's b**** until you give it money.
8981	1	a	This game is Kinda good but it is very complicated to start!
10080	1	a	I really like this game xD
7236	0	a	nothing but pay2win and hackers and trolls.
6239	0	a	Does it spread cancer? â Does it ruin your life? â Do you get called a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ every time you kill someone? â Does it have 255 level players with grenade launchers? â Is that grenade launcher op as â¥â¥â¥â¥? â Does it give AIDS? â Do you still want to play even though this game is full of â¥â¥â¥â¥? â
2804	1	a	Good graphics, big community, frequent updates, A HUGE CUSTOMIZATION, and it's free. What else could you ask for(besides for the cars to have better steering)?
6470	0	a	First time setup takes too long to load. if you are immortal or simply have a few years to waste then i do recommend this game. customization in this game is amazing, but gameplay is simply horrible.
8230	0	a	Pay to win piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥.
5660	0	a	i get an error about MSVCR not being designed to run on windows after multiple attempts at installing all the redist. packs, help? because this makes the game unplayable and i would love to have this game :(
2067	1	a	Do you like spending real money over and over agian on the same game? Well this one is for YOU!! Friends are needed to play and have fun IMO, being the cops can be quite dull most times, and the crooks are ballin. The power of the darkside is everywhere, no one should be able to survive. He runs the underworld with a deathly fist. Why you ask, because it's raining .... raining upon my teary eyed face with no way to tell if you are Dead or Alive?!
8259	0	a	i like this game a lot but the thing i hate most is not being able to drive i joined a server that had a a 284 ms i cant drive shoot or do anything really so i cant play unless theres a server close to me.
8167	0	a	Well i have waited for 18 minutes but nothing happen..
7261	0	a	game isnt actually free to play
4347	0	a	What a horrible game, after installing the game, I waited close to five minutes for it to finally load. Then, with the limited choices available for character creation, alot in list, but not all available; then finally, when ready to start the game, it FREEZES, to the point that it wouldn't even let me shut it down with task manager, wouldn't even let task manager window come up. I actually had to log out of my computer account for the stupid game to let me OUT.
4643	0	a	Don't mind the Steam played time. I played it when RTW owned it, and I've got 188 hours in the G1 version.  Let me break this down for you.  The game advertises customizing your guns to fit your playstyle. Unfortunately, to do that, you will need to grind. A lot. First you have to grind contacts to unlock that gun, then you have to grind kills to get upgrades for that gun (that may not even be the upgrade type you want).  And the grinding will NOT be fun. The playerbase is all but gone, which means matchmaking (not that it was EVER good) is horrible. Expect to be stomped on constantly by the folks who have spent plenty of cash for the much more effective ARMAS weapons. Also expect to be matched up against gold players as a bronze or silver a lot. They hang out in the bronze districts because there's nobody to be found in silver or gold.  So if you like being forced to open the ARMAS store every time you open the game (unless you turn off Steam in-game), having UPGRADE NOW flash at you every time you finish a mission, and having to get your â¥â¥â¥ stomped on for hours upon hours because there's literally nobody else to play against, this game is for you.  If you don't like lessons in masochism, do not play this game. I tried. I really tried to enjoy the game, but I just couldn't... and I fear you might not either.  Unless you drop a couple hundred dollars and start mowing people down. Then you might like it.  EDIT: Lest I forget there IS a way to get the cash shop guns by grinding tons of in-game cash and daily limited Joker tickets. So if you're a masochist, this game is for you.
9977	0	a	I started to download the game when I went to bed and it made my HD make alot of noise and kept waking me up. Then DocTarr said it was crap. So I erased it.
6002	0	a	stay away from apb, unless you're a masochistic.
940	1	a	If you want a good free game, this game is for you!!!
135	1	a	Thee Age of All thee Points, of Bulletin. In of Reloaded.  In the land of Memorium, there once was a game which in it's early state, had brought itself shame.  And of that game, it came to die. But, it was reborn, and yet problems did apply.  At first there was happiness among the lands, the people danced, and typed their commands.  The played, they fought, and had their fun,  until Armas, G1's wretch, released the next gun.  Of their box, in of horror, did they spill: The unholy OP weapons and cheapo's will.  Cowards, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s, brawlers, looter's filled the population. The games proper, way, and interest came to cessation.  For years, did the land rot, did the people die out, and did demons rise. Until as of recently, the new DEV's of a new age, began their apprise.   We've seen there wrath, and their wrong.  But perhaps now is the age of improvement ...  so that APB can once again be strong.   
7247	0	a	I can't say I actually would recommend this game. That doesn't mean it's not a fun game some of the time, but usally it's honestly pretty bad. You'll get lucky if you find some people who aren't hacking, scum bag trolls or self-procalimed 'pro-players.' The people you'll typically run into are your average scum bags who will constantly tell you how bad you are and that you suck and blah blah blah even though they can't seem to win the match either. BUT when you do find some good people and get in a group, the game can be pretty fun. The customization is very good too, plus there should be an game engine update sometime in 2016 as well.   Edit: Yeah that engine update still hasn't happened.
5451	0	a	I am not intrested in games with just pvp all the time and the players are hackers and jerks so i do not recommend this game at all.
1400	1	a	FUN AS â¥â¥â¥â¥ING HELL IGN 10/10
5503	0	a	wasted a minute and a half of my life downloading this game, to waste another 20 minutes getting the game to even start, to waste another 30 minutes trying to figure out why i had a blank black screen but could still hear the game sound, to finally waste another minute in a half figuring out that this game is not windows 10 compatible.....
3782	0	a	If you have enough money you can win at this game!   Yes you can unlock and buy weapons with ingame money too, but premium weapons are way too powerful. When you have low level starting gear and the matchmaking.............It's total b*llshit! You have to play with people who have bigger level and better weapons than you. The biggest problem is that this game has, is its unbalanced matchmaking and premium gear.  Edit: 14/5/2015  The community of this game is so toxic! The game is full of trolls, A*sholes and premium guys calling free to play players noobs.   Do yourself a favor, and don't install this if you don't want to pay for guns.
359	1	a	it is a little bit underated the game is fun if following like to make music, playing the game or make kickass art
2682	1	a	Good free game, but lacking something......
5435	0	a	Good game but horrific lag if your'e trying to play from AUSTRALIA. unable to drive with so much lag and you dont stand a chance too much LAGGGGGGGGGG
8828	0	a	Ruined. ð
6721	0	a	So hmm, this game is awsome, the features and combat system is amazing the only down about this game is that theres too many hackers. Idk if hacks are easy to get in apb but you can see one hacker in almost every missions u play
269	1	a	itz awesome and u get to do allot of awesome things....If ur a fan of comps and robers then this is the game for u :D  
6989	0	a	this game is straight up meth. hooks you in to the game. yet the game itself isn't good in anyway.   if your enemy has a better gun, your dead. how to win fights with equals, jump,crouch, act like a madman with a gun.  oh you want to know about the cars? well you can literally blow up a car by running into it with yours if it's fast enough. unavoidable death to teh opposing side. you can't shoot trough windows. takes forever to blow up teh car (unless you got a real money bought weapon) , which the driver gets a notification 10 full seconds before. unless ofcourse you got a rocket launcher. which insta kills anything, you can't really miss. and if you don't have a payed for gun. don't even think about shooting at a guy with a launcher. he will turn around and set you flying off better than north koreas rocket program.  oh you want guns? well you either buy it again every 10 days or you pay real money for it. even up to 40$. not even kidding.  only the basic concept of the game is good. but the game is literally designed to minimize skill out of the game. thus having better guns be an absolute grindfiest to get. or you pay for it. in real money.  only 2 good things, the character creation is actually quite good, but since it allows you to change your height, there is absolutetly no headshot dmg multiplier of sorts. hit him anywhere adn the same dmg is applie.  and for the otehr ofcourse the uninstall process. this game is horrible.
10743	0	a	what the â¥â¥â¥â¥
4964	0	a	there are boters on this game it sucks
3347	1	a	This game is like chewing gum, you eat it, spit it out and never eat it again. ( Í¡Â° ÍÊ Í¡Â°)  10/10
10269	1	a	I have started playing this game this week and have found it to be a enjoyable one. the game is much like fallout if you liked that game then you would enjoy. the graphics are ok but i find that this gives this game a diffrent feel and in away the fact theat their not amazing has given it a diffrent look and aspect and me personal enjoye this about it as now a days its all about the graphics and this gives a brake from that. thir seems to be a problem with the landscape loading and then doesent buffer as well as not a frecent movement seem to be laggey ( friends have had same problem) but besides that what i have played so far is enjoyable. i would recomend this game to people who enjoy games like fallout.hope you have the same enjoyment i have had and i hope it continuse thought the game for me
6468	0	a	Do not play this game. It is riddled with hacker and the devs have no vested interest in preventing it on any level. It's â¥â¥â¥â¥in pathetic and the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ who developed this WILL NOT ban, prevent, or fix any issues.
7061	0	a	I dont care for this game, it was free
3386	1	a	It's pretty good as long as you don't play it too much
8948	1	a	Such an underrated game. If you like to craft then this game is for you. Crafting in most MMO's is generally pointless and uninteresting. In Fallen earth you craft everything. All your clothes, all your armour, all your weapons and even your mounts. Want to travel the wasteland in a dune buggy well collect your materials, craft your components and put them together to drive your own set of wheels. This game is all about gathering, quests and crafting.  it has a very friendly community which will answer any question in the chat window instantly. Exploring and fighting is challenging at times but always good fun. the game can be complicated as it is so in depth. Easily the most in depth game i have ever played. The great thing about this game is that it is absolutely free, yes you can subscribe for extra benefits but you can play the whole game for free in its entirity. The graphics are a bit dated now but the gameplay more than makes up for it. its free, give it a go.
7854	0	a	You ever wonder what it's like when you mix elements such as Massive Multiplayer online capabilities and Great free-roaming environments together? Heh, me too... You might want to check any game other than this one. So, go on, get out of here before your elders see you desacrating your family honor...
9585	1	a	zdfggfdgfdgfgdfgdgfd Its purrrrrrfect
9108	0	a	it SUCKS it took my like 3 hoursto play and it isnt even good
886	1	a	this game is best game for me :D that's fun when people say you hacker when your not.Most thing that i love it is that it is free game i didnt pay for any thing and im gold. i think u have to fight for your level like be bronz and gold and silver and ... that's bets game :D APB RELOADED (when i was a kid)  Well know APB reloaded is a boring game for those who play it 1000/... houre, but it is still a good game,and i love to spend my time on it(a bit)
9784	1	a	If you are one of those 100% completion types, this will keep you occupied for a very very long time. i have over 200 hours in this game, and i still haven't even left the first major area. and i still have quite a bit more to do yet before i will move on.    also good if you are a cheap â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ like me. all that time in, and i've spent no real money. i may not ever(sorry devs) because i can gather and craft anything i might need.   not for the impatient. some things can take a very long time(days) to craft, and only one at a time.
3733	1	a	no headshots&lt;3.
4504	0	a	Pay to Win, all the highest skilled players buy guns, gear, and cosmetics with real money to get an edge against F2P players. Spawnkilling and Camping is rampent, community chatbox is complete cancer, giving you an experience reminicient of Youtube Comments instead of a real multiplayer experience. Teamwork is required but doesn't exist with most players. Playing alone outside of missions actually gets you more money than in missions with less risk of meeting a P2W player.  Enforcers overpopulate most servers and have an edge on players.  Server-end Latency results in it feeling like it takes forever to kill players, shooting them dozens of times to kill them. But of course if you purchase a gun from the 'armas marketplace' you instantly play better at the game.  While the characters are interesting and fun looking, the ultimate result in this game is disappointing, and the combination of cancerous P2W methods, spawncamping, hackers, outdated graphics, and repetitive gameplay make this ultimately an old attempt at making a free to play GTA game, and you will have better luck just going and playing GTA5.  For Character customization, go to any current-era MMO game and you will be able to find similar if not better.  This game isn't worth the time nor the effort.
10191	1	a	So much fun from a well designed free to play game! Never thought they would be this good.
10066	0	a	do not download this game!!! it is pure crap and i would advise staying away from it like it could give you aids or something!!!
10763	1	a	Its hard, but awesome! Is harsome!
7642	0	a	I Spawned as a cop, ran over 10 people, shot 5, wrecked 3 cars and unistalled due to gameplay. Man it sucks, what type of cop am ?
7793	0	a	When i joined this, it was fun, but it forced me to have to buy more ram just to play, but even then i lagged during any battle..  reason i dont reccomend this: SUPER cpu heavy, it lags bad if you dont have a serious up to date graphic card or more then 8gb ram, seems they put alot into graphics which causes older computers or people who dont buy computers every year not able to play it.  i still login from time to time, but it became un-fun when it was nothing but trolls bashing your car/truck into walls with garbage trucks, or children screaming on the voice system just to annoy you.  i dont reccomend this if you have a older cpu, or cant handle the graphics, also if you cant deal with kiddy trolls bashing you every 5 mins not allowing you to do anything.
5871	0	a	If you can actually log in its ok
10101	1	a	its a fun unique game if ur looking for something with first and third person and killing enemies and a kind of a free world sandbox and with quests and horses i really enjoyed it :)
9632	1	a	This game is good to pass some time and to play a fun not to big rpg
3488	1	a	This game feels really good and easy to run.
4072	0	a	Fun for a while... then it gets horrible. Go play GTA online, its much better.
10255	0	a	This game is complete â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t i can't even get into the game for 2seconds whithout it freezing and crashing my computer
3991	0	a	For the 1st and 2nd day this was a great game to play by myself and with friends. However over time this game started to slip away from the fun side. The game was full of tryhards, and I could see it was a pay to win because of this I started to feel less pumped about the game. I started to think 'Am I back in call of duty?'. However I continued playing the game as I liked large amounts of it and that I'm not one to just turn my back on a game due to some 'errors'. Then on the 3rd or 4th day (after being stressed out from everyday life) I logged in to have a whale of a time only to find a lovely message 'account blocked/ error 10008'. After looking online I found many people have got this due to so called 'cheating'. I have not cheated. So why am I blocked from this game! I'm not saying people don't cheat but People have been playing the game for thousands of hours and kicked due to just playing the damn game! Some people have just got the game and blocked before they had even started playing the game. Sounds fishy? I also have problems logging onto they're website and I feel like I have wasted 44 hours. 44 hours I'm not getting back! I feel sorry for the people who have spent hundreds of hours on this! So no, I don't recommend this game. Sorry APB Reloaded but never again will I play your games or recommend this game to anyone else. Thank you to anyone who spent there time to read this and thank you to the people who have made and helped keep this game running for the hours of fun I have had but I think I'm ganna stick to the games that care about they're players.   From your little friend MÐÆ ÆÆÆ ÆÈ¤
1699	1	a	APB is a very good game. Belongs to the sand table style game can be where you let all can go. There are many ways to do the task, very interesting
5589	0	a	This game doesnt work too â¥â¥â¥â¥ for my computer
10184	0	a	I did not enjoy this game one bit, the controls are really irritating and very hard to use. It gives very little information on how to even play. I do NOT recmend this game to anyone.
8121	0	a	Well what can i tell you that has not already been said, this game was fair and loaded with hackers but still playable in the beginning and as time passed it went down hill. I am a senior player with max level characters and you can take this review for what it is, my experiences over time  few examples 1. Devs/GMs have there fav players make them testers, as representatives of the game they get free weapons the problem is they have the poorest attitude and only promote a bad gaming experience, and trying to report them is like trying to put a 3 inch nail in concrete with a playschool hammer, the GMs and Devs are useless cardboard cutouts, lol and they like to ban people for speaking there mind and challenging them when they are being one sided to there friends. This is what you get when you let untrained people run a company and a game with sooooooo much potential  2. still a horrible balance system, bugs and lag out the butt even after this long and one sided spawning, placing one player at 50m from item and the other 400m  3. Lol the world saving new anti cheat system and the root of most of the new problems FAIRFIGHT. Don't get me wrong I love this anti cheat as it fished out all of the players you already knew were hacking and was good for some lols when you read the forums from the top rankers who were banned, but it gave G1 some thing new to focus on how to make there game a pay to play again. The solution? Tweaked armas guns. Yes most of these guns are just reskins of stock weapons but...... the stats are tweaked just enough so that with the right mods you will out perform any free to play weapon, crack your wallets open now  4. lol 'the children have come out to play'. To many wet behind the ears, window licking kids on here now. They got mommy's credit card and and a whinny mouth that won't close, they are usually the first ones to cry hacker at a loss or cry noob to other players at a win you will never here a gg from them, and its only going to get worse when the console kids get on....THIS I HOPE WILL BE THE FINAL NAIL IN THIS GAMES SAD DOWNFALL COFFIN  Most senior players and clans have long abandoned this game you see them from time to time usually in the chat room visiting but most of the GG players are gone, they have a good nose they can smell when something is dead  I'm not saying don't try it but just be warned this is what you get to look forward to
6365	0	a	HOW LONG AGO HAVE THEY RELEASE THIS FRIGGIN GAME AND THEY STILL DON'T HAVE FULL CONTROLLER SUPOORT, DAFUQ?... YCKY. WARFRAME CAME OUT AFTER THIS AND THESE GUYS STILL DON'T HAVE THEIR â¥â¥â¥â¥ TOGETHER WTF? NOT EVERYONE CAN PLAY ON A KEYBOARD... THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WITH BIG HANDS AND CONTROLLERS CAN ACCOMMODATE THIS ISSUE, WHICH MAKES PLAYING THE GAME MORE ENJOYABLE AND COMFORTABLE. PLEASE RP GET YOUR SHET TOGETHER GOD!!!! 
2628	1	a	Not bad for a free game however as soon as you start the game you instantly feel the pressure of microtransactions.
2277	1	a	  its a good game but we need a motorbike and a bus and a plane and a tank and a aircarft
8027	0	a	It's GTA + aimbots
639	1	a	Its sow funny whit frends
5178	0	a	Okay, I don't write reviews at all so don't take this as a grain of salt but a whole flippin' mineral.  It's bad. I downloaded this because of nostalgic memories, playing this at my exes house and actually somewhat enjoying it. This was what? 4-5 years ago. Not sure what human smashed their head off the keyboard to produce the code and ideas I see present now.   As I write this the game is loading, I just checked and it disconnected me. Now, that sounds all fine and dandy if it wasn't the second if not third time this has done this....  Honestly, the only reason I have 5+ hours on this game is because 2 was spent on customizing my character and the rest was loading screens or errors.  Save your time and find a better game.    Love, a disappointed and drunk peep.
4808	0	a	It left something running in the background of my computer for 244.66 hours. I played for 20 minutes. 
1223	1	a	i want to play but i dont know how to fix Not RESPONDING
8235	0	a	Not worth your time, between random triggerbots and aimbots and not too mention people who decide they dont like you for no intention what so ever report you and state false lies and gamersfirst believes them over true fool proof they have with there fairfight system and block you.  Ps: spend your cash elsewhere
10648	1	a	I guess this game is ok. :D
2374	1	a	it is fun 
2254	1	a	Personally, I really like this game. It is pretty much a free version of GTA online, but very fun.
3226	1	a	GTA V for free .
4923	0	a	this game is really fun and all but it is a pane in the butt because when you try to run it it going to scew up so no i don't recemend it
2213	1	a	It's pay to win &amp; the loading screens got loading screens... but still you can make you character look awesoome!
8511	0	a	If you're thinking about tryin this game, I would not jump in at this point because the learning curve is a bit too steep to compete with the players who have been on for a while.
7371	0	a	This game was with unique idea, super good customization and etc it was perfect, but then, like it always happens - cheaters and hackers come. The game is ruined now.
5275	0	a	Jesus Christ is my â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥
1059	1	a	I have a love-hate relationship with APB Reloaded. The pros are that it's a ton of fun to play. The cons are that it's really hard to get the hang of, and it's very buggy and crashy. Your screen loading times are also going to suck. But if you can get past all that, it's not bad for a Free To Play online GTA.
3547	1	a	Awesome and fun game and make you spend alot of time on it
2486	1	a	This game is great fun and you easily get hooked to it. Both maps are amazing and teamwork strives in this game. The customization is epic and will get you editing you characted/cars for hours. The major problem to this game is that it is a pay to win, if you are going to spend some money, think twice.
1840	1	a	When APB first came out it was a fun and interesting Idea, many many balance problems but the future looked bright, that was until 3 weeks after the game was released it was shutdown due to 0 cash and 0 cash means no company means no servers. Eventually G1 picked it up and relaunched it with some minor tweaks and all was good except no compensation for players who previously bought the game. History aside now lets get into it, this will be fairly short.  Gameplay is alright, G1 surprisingly continued to develope the game and not just let it be a cash grab completely. The rework to the economy where you rent guns rather than buy sucks, a lot. the poor hacker prevention is terrible but hackers dont run to terribly rampant and low skill players wont run into them hardly at all. All in all its interesting, with a fairly par shooting mechanic, and a nice amount of customisation for the free player and a lot for the subscriber. I never feel like I have to subscribe even though I have on a few special occasion when I play for more than a month at a time. Something about it keeps pulling me back time and time again, sometimes just a few days, or a month. but just like EVE online for me I just cant quit it for long. (although in APB I'm not blacklisted by multiple corps for abandoment and possible spy ect ect.)  overall. 6/10 a good fun time but come expecting that you are gonna spend possibly 20 minutes at a time just being bent over and taking it from all sides while you can do nothing but throw your body on an objective praying that you dont get turned to tiny gibs of goo and being reminded that you got pwnd by all sorts of catchy or horribly annoying theme songs.
2561	1	a	the best game but kicking me all time plz fix it
775	1	a	This game is amazing, 10/10
10533	0	a	I've played this game since the beginning. You won't see that on my profile, because I played on the browser, until I recently went to check it out again. Big mistake.   All this game does is â¥â¥â¥â¥ me off anymore, and not because I die over and over, that's part of the fun. What pisses me off is seeing a game I used to love being ruined and turned pay-to-win by Kabam. Kabam has done nothing but â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game over completely since they bought it out. It's focused on how much money you can dump in the game, rather than how good you are, and how much time and effort you put in to FINDING your gear.   You used to have to hunt forever to get a good set, now you can just slap a few bucks down, and walk out of the nexus like hot â¥â¥â¥â¥. Not to mention how they completely screwed the loot system. Not only did they add ninja, which would be a good idea, if it weren't for the fact that they added a new weapon type, instead of using one of the ones already in the game, but I swear they also lowered the drop rate on gear.   For those who don't know about the game, the ninja's unique weapon means that about 75% of weapons that drop are completely useless. Before ninjas were in the game, 66% couldn't be used by your class. This is because ninja weapons drop as commonly as the other 4 types, even though the other 4 have 2-3 classes using them.  As for the lower drop rate, I can only assume that's so that they can sell more gear to people.  I really wish I could still like this game. I used to play all the time, and I had 3 8/8 characters, full tops/UT, including alt weapons and abilities, and tons of â¥â¥â¥â¥ in my vault. The sad thing is that I can't in good conscience tell anyone to play this game, because it's evolved into what I can only describe as a Facebook game.  Please, Kabam, I know you must have a heart. Please give control back to WildShadowStudios, they knew how to run this game better than you guys ever will. You are ruining what used to be my favorite game.
10038	1	a	Closest thing to Fallout Online there is. Unfortunately, not a whole lot of players. Definetely try this out though.
4989	0	a	there are boters on this game it sucks
3500	1	a	A good game, whit good graphics. I can say it's hard if you don't use gamers material, in the same time it's a P2W, but still recommanded for the people who have skills :)
201	1	a	APB is the one game ive played that ive had as much fun winning in, its rewarding, satisfying on so many levels. But its also one of the most frustrating and cheater filled games you'll find. But since they added the new anti-cheat system called 'Fairfight' its been a severe change amongst the opposition you face. Most of the time its good fun and great players, but at many points during missions you will encounter people that are questionable at best. Its widely known that cheaters still exist within APB Reloaded and it doesnt feel like the developers are actually taking it as seriously as some would want.  The game itself is based highly on the Ingame Marketplace that you spend real life cash in to procure lifetime bonuses such as weaponry, vehicles, clothing and the infamous 'Joker boxes' that personaly i bought over a 100 of, and never got any good loot from. Supposedly the boxes have a chance to drop legendary weapons such as the even more infamous 'OCA Nano' machine pistol. Its the most overpowered weapon in the game as its capable of literally wiping the floor with enemy opposition up too 100 meters(The maximum sight range ingame) even at full auto(LoL)   But even with the problems that exist in the game its still one of the few games ive spent over 1000 hours playing and still play from time to time. Like previously stated, you arnt likely to find a game that is as satisfying to win in as in APB.  If the gameplay doesnt do everything for you there is the most advanced character customization existing so far in any kind of MMO's out there, and you can spend hour after hour just modifying, adding tattoos, painting cars, and not actually doing anything else.  8/10
3436	1	a	I cant get in from this game 
6580	0	a	The servers are dead... If you are lucky, there will possibly be one other person who will join the map you are in. That being said, after 10 minutes of play, I uninstalled.
2144	1	a	its a fun free game like gta with way more customization allowed i recomebd this game to all who like shooters
962	1	a	hOW DO I GET IT TO START?!?!?
2532	1	a	It's not pay to win. I promise.
7887	0	a	This game is CRAP seriously i wasted 1090 hours on bull â¥â¥â¥â¥ the missons are the same , people are actually hacking , fairfight banning random people for being good and PAY TO FU=KING WIN is bull â¥â¥â¥â¥ its more like pay to lose and get banned
1605	1	a	Great game allot of fun.
8251	0	a	i cant play this game it just black screens
7868	0	a	Game won't load. But I wouldn't say its bad. Just putting thumbs down because it won't start up.
612	1	a	So Cool Game But You Know Cheaters ...  Cheaters Everywhere
8157	0	a	This game dont have something what destroy this game -this game dont have good match making so you will se 50,49,85 versus 245,200,180 
9110	1	a	Nice simple apocolyptic game. Few small kinks but I'm sure with few patches and graphics update will look really nice in the long run.
2830	1	a	This game took me by suprise it drains your time and is very fun GOOD GAME!!!
903	1	a	- Had a lvl94 Enforcer account - Some criminal shouted 'PRESS K FOR PREMIUM' - I Press k, - Got a team of bronze while im gold and against me team of Ursus, Sitting duck and Raptor + Bloodymary, - Was 1v1'ing against someone with sitting duck and got jump shotted, - Teammates was spraying all around the map with ntecs hoping to hit and kill someone - Respawned in a car like nothinghappend, - I get out of the car and suddenly I get run over by the new IO GROWL, - Ragequitted and went to my other maxout account.  10/10 Would get ran over again.
6400	0	a	played it for 1.3 hours, worst game i've played in a long time. It's pointlessly restrictive and boring, no play.
3516	1	a	This is a good multiplayer game to play with and meet new friends. Although the majority of the community is somewhat backward when it comes to social skills.   There are some problems with server performance and hits registering which still need to be fixed. The developers keep releasing P2W weapons that are basically re-skins of stock weapons. Joker boxes are, well, a joke: you just get trails for guns you already have... unless you spend hundreds of $ (which is exactly what they want).   Snipers ruin the game.   Cheaters are still a problem, although they have a new anti-cheat (PunkBuster was a joke).  Character customization is good; however, the designer isn't very well optimized or user friendly.   People make a fuss that this game is Pay to Win but I actually don't think it is. An experienced player can do just as much damage with the stock weapons (some of them broken).   I do, however, think that charging people to unlock car parts is pretty low (you have to buy car parts with real money).  Also, you have to be certain ranks to use mods like car surfer etc. which I think is silly since it gives high ranks an even bigger advantage.   Matchmaking is shocking - you have r22 vs. r255 - r255 silvers in a bronze district etc. Matchmaking should go on rank, not threat. This also creates a problem with idiots who decide to 'dethreding xD' [dethreating] in your mission by completely messing it up, so they can decrease their threat level.   Premium isn't implemented very well - it counts down even though you're not playing. I'd like to see premium depleat per playing time. As it stands, premium is a gimmick.   G1 credits are overpriced, and most of the content isn't worth it.   Overall, it's a good game if you're not playing with nubs - otherwise it can get annoying. Gameplay is also somewhat repetative (and they keep fixing bugs that make the game funny).
1538	1	a	it's a relli good game nice graphics but check it before downloading tht u can run it or not k if not dont worry ask me on steam k :)
692	1	a	Its quite interesting i must say!
8177	0	a	not even worth it i have to download this game twice to get it to run and it crashes my pc which is able to run it not worth the time or effort even if it is a free game its more like free piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥
1685	1	a	Cool game :)
3761	0	a	It was fun while it lasted, the missions are too repetitive and the dialogue is poor and un interesting, the city is dull and full of mindless civilians that run in front of you or get in the way while you are trying to gun someone down the progression is the slowest i have ever played, the game is full of hackers and ddosers, the community cries and hackusates everyone who is good, the clothing in the armas marketplace is too overpriced and the weapons, all people do in this game is just sit in social district and talk $hit to one another, it's a good free to play game.. but you will get dominated by the crap matchmaking if you are starting fresh off a new character, only good thing in this game is the in deph customization that no other mmo has, but other than that it's mostly just a 'social simulator' full of cry babies and rage quiters and hackers, So if you wanna play it go ahead it's Free to Play but be prepared to be destroyed by the higher ranks..  'CAUTION: PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK!'
2171	1	a	This game is like a really bad cigarette; Really expensive and you know it's terrible but it is so addicting you just can't stop. Playing with friends I recommend, don't expect it to be easy either. Raging will be involved, but it only makes you want to get better.
6739	0	a	Honestly I love the idea of this game, it is a GREAT idea. I think, however, that it was poorly executed in many ways (displaying the single point to which you have to drive a slow, paper-armored car to the people whose job it was to blow up the car comes to mind, as well as the hitboxes which mean you were never REALLY behind cover).  Also word on the grapevine is that it's currently buggy beyond reason.  All this is a bloody pity because it had HUGE promise.
7391	0	a	p2w but good balance for being a free2play game.
2274	1	a	This game is fun but you need to spend a lot of money if you want to play good. ( PAY TO WIN )
7376	0	a	Okay, don't get me wrong here - the idea of a modern-city shooter with free-roaming missions and constant PvP is not bad at all. However, there are some serious problems with this game.  The fact that the vehicles have clunky controls I could stand. The way the missions are handled I could stand.  But the system requirements are absolutely RIDICULOUS. You basically need a top-end system to get any usable framerate out of this game. Any less, and you'll have 10-second pauses in any sort of loading - which is inexcusable with this type of gameplay.
8813	0	a	This game is pretty bad..!   Matchmaking almost none existant. Open Mics HUD / UI is bad not player friendly. For 16 years old and under ! The cummunity is horrible everyong just trash talks everyone.. Pay to Win --  The only good thing is rich customization of a charecter/Items.  Industrial/Cyberpunk Style game!
5720	0	a	this game is not only pretty laggy also every vip guy who plays here they are impossible to beat them since they all have stronger weapons than non Vip people wich really makes me not even pay a cent to this game
8337	0	a	This game at the first release was a GTA online free to play fix for those who didnt have a console to play GTA on. My friend introduced this to me a long time ago and it initally seemed like a fun game. Tons of customization, open world city, decent ranking system, and some pretty memorable fights. Though as the game has changed, so has my feelings for it. ABP has become a buy-to-win unfriendly tumor of a game to which I cant remotely enjoy anymore. The worse thing about this game is basically who ever buys the $40 assault rifle through micro transactions along with the $35 rocket launcher is now deemed invincible. APB has become a sandbox that requires you to buy quality weapons with real time money or else you will be the punching bag of the game. My friend bought me a $20 assualt rifle and let me tell you that made everything a lot easier... but that didnt help long since more people would buy the $40 ones. I dont consider a game fun when it requires equipment quality over skill, it shouldnt be who ever has the most expensive gun wins every match, rather it should be who ever has the keenest shot or the quickest reflexes and a quality weapon helps to a degree. sorry for this poorly written review but i do not recommend playing APB, its simply a cluster of microtransaction idiots with completely decked out assault rifles and RPG's
2869	1	a	Best thing ever
7241	0	a	It might say I only have 50 hours, but I mostly played without steam on another account. I played atleast 600 hours of APB in total.  Whatever you do, don't play this game. It's trash, such pay to win. The legendary weapons are way too overpowered and expensive, all the free weapons hardly match up and even if they do, they have been buffed with modifications which p2w weapons already have those. Gamers First doesn't fix any bugs in APB, this is the buggiest multiplayer game I have ever seen. They can't even fix the fighting club bug where it reverts your progress when you reach the gold place.  I kept saying to myself : - This game will get fixed one day, it will become even better.  I was wrong. I actually spent some cash on this game just to get banned 3 months later for.... for.... nothing. My account got a random block out of the blue. I wrote a ticket only to be greeted by a bot which simply stated that my account was banned for 3rd party application use. DOES â¥â¥â¥â¥ING SKYPE COUNT??! NO? THEN HOW IN THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ I GOT A PERMA BAN? I am not the first one to be banned for absolutely nothing.   The worst part is that I lost the weapon I bought for over 40$...  The game it self has a great concept, but the company only wants money. Don't even get me started on the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t events they do...  Overall, I don't recommend this game for : Poor customer service, in-game p2w shop, sloopy events, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ server/game maintenance, unfair bans.
4845	0	a	Still not as good as Enemy Territory Online.
7830	0	a	This game is nearly dead... Only a few hardcore players left plus the server latency makes this game impossible to play (completely ignoring the p2w aspect).
2721	1	a	awesome game, if only they made every item just a bit cheaper. but i dont care. EPIC COPS AND ROBBERS LIKE GAME.
6562	0	a	This is a 'freemium' game. It's free, but you have to pay for the good â¥â¥â¥â¥ to win
1412	1	a	A really good game with lots of customisation options, really fun to play with friends, it gets patched alot and the devs fix alot of bugs. The only 'big' problem of this game is the server lag that can sometimes annoy you and make you rage quit, but all in all its a really fun game :)
3102	1	a	My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.' I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.
8489	0	a	I really like the customization,but it's too PayToWin. You can't just spend 100$ on a game.
9450	0	a	Godawful game, its a laggy mess with horrible graphics. Just Don't get it. Its a waste of time.
8040	0	a	--This game is not F2P, you either pay for premium or don't bother--  APB Reloaded is a game that can be lots of fun but only if you buy a premium account...  I used the premium account trial and I had a great time playing as a criminal but when my trial ran out it immediately had huge effects on my game, most of my stuff became unusable and my best vehicle that I put loads of in-game cash into was turned into a pay wall.  This game has awful matchmaking, I was put into multiple matches against people who were three times my level and all they had to do was shoot me in the foot and I would die instantly.  If I was willing to buy a premium account I would probably like this game but the faulty matchmaking and dodgy reports about the developers will keep me far away from this game.
1034	1	a	The game was fun and addicting for a bit. Games were pretty competitive except matchmaking wasn't too fair.
193	1	a	It's pretty fun to play with friends for a little bit and then it often gets really boring. 7/10
3351	1	a	great game thou i dont like the player vehicle system where you can only drive ai cars, your car, or people in the same mission you are but other than that really fun open world mmo
10111	1	a	Great Game! Lots of story, gameplay, and awesome players who will help you out along the way! I wish there were a few more options to reduce lag though.
9504	1	a	interesting game, but takes too long to launch and install it.
2146	1	a	Its a great game. good things are that you can, edit your caracter 99% the way you want if you know how to and have the time, editing cars is a great thing when you dont rage YOU will, it goes on and on now bad things, No motorbikes please bring it to the game pls, if you dont have a friend too play whit you will be bored easly, the rage that you can get in this game is SO big, Its a pay to win game almost      Sorry for bad english BYE GONNA MISS YOU :(
10638	1	a	Great game if you like a free rome action packed dungeon rpg
2263	1	a	A really cool open world shoot them up and it's basiclly saints row the third mixed with E.A
7349	0	a	I've played far too much of this game, and let me go ahead and tell you not to make the same mistake I did.  For the sake of new players or those interested without knowing, this game is effectively a PVP only game, everything that results in progression in the game is done through fighting other players of the opposite faction.  The game may see some improvement in the future, but as it stands, this game has so many problems with balance, stability, etc that it simply isnt enjoyable.  For the longest time, I've played this game dealing with what issues it has to enjoy the cornucopia of interesting features and customization that the game has, but all in all it isnt worth it. The servers are laggy constantly, skill level seems to not matter at all as far as player placement is concerned, and many players including myself are stricken with constant jerking and stuttering. Now I can't discredit the game too much for the stuttering, thats probably more on my end, but the game has more then enough problems aside from that for me to wholeheartedly tell you not to play this game.    Problem #1: 'Matchmaking'   Notice that matchmaking is in quotes, there is a reason for that. APB doesn't really have much of a matchmaking system to speak of. Players are allowed into and recommended to go to different instances of the games two districts based on their current skill rating, while the player's level is generally not factored into the allowance into a certain instance of a district. This at first seems like a relatively fair system, those who play better would soon be designated 'gold' skill level players that are allowed to play on gold and silver level districts. Gold players are absolutely abundant in this game, and this leads to one of two outcomes for any one given time, Either the gold servers are full, so all of the gold players are in low player skill designated districts,  OR  the gold servers are completely empty, and therefore none of the golds want to go there, so they still go to low skill districts. Now, this basically means that no matter where you are, what level you've achieved, or what skill level you may be, you're going to run into a bunch of golds. And more than likely, they'll destroy you. Now I know what some of you may be thinking 'Oh you're just a noob complaining about getting owned by other players, stop whining and get better at the game.' And while I will admit I am not the best of players, take this into account: I normally hover around silver skill level, this means that I can access pretty much every level of server, if I feel ballsy enough I can go to a gold district, I can stay in silver (filled mostly with golds) or I can go to bronze with lower skilled players. Being silver and not wanting to fight all of the gold players who all are extremely high ranked and all seem to have a rocket launcher pointed directly at your face, I started to play on the bronze districts. When in a bronze district one of two things happened, I either encountered bronze players and my fellow silvers and had a relatively balanced match, with fair fighting, good play on each side, and everybody had a decent amount of fun, OR I had a team full of bronze players and was matched against a team with 4 out of 5 players being gold. Now, gold players arent generally allowed on bronze servers, but thats the thing, if you purposefully lose enough to get yourself to silver you can go right in, win once or twice and get your gold back, and proceed to stay in the surver murdering everyone.    Problem #2: Threat Levels.   Now your threat rating generally is supposed to tell other players how skilled you are, its a general measurement of your wins over losses etc, now this could be considered only measuring skill, more often than not however gold players have weapons that were purchased within the games cash shop, which are fully modded, and just monumentally better than anything you could get with in game currency even relatively later in the game. This means that for many players, the only reason they've achieved a gold rating is because of superior equipment. Now don't get me wrong, the game is not entirely pay to win, you have just as much opportunity to destroy people with guns purchased with in game currency, many of the high level guns and modifications are equally effective if not moreso than the guns one can purchase with real money, but the problem is that all of these gold players stepping all over your play space makes it extremely difficult to progress at all. If you're constantly losing to gold players with fancy weaponry then you arent going to progress far enough to get the weapons that supposedly make the game's cash shop 'balanced.' So basically, 80% of the time or more, any gold you see is only gold because he has a shiny gun he bought for 10 bucks. Some people get there the hard way, but its alot easier when you get great weapons at the get go.    Problem #3: The Cash Shop.   Now, while the cash shop is of course necessary for the game to EXIST due to it being free to play, its also the reason that the game is so damn difficult for anyone who chooses (or simply can't) pay. The problem here is that the game is entirely player vs player. You can't really say that a normal MMORPG that is heavily reliant on player purchases for player success is truly pay to win, because you still have the option of playing the game without conflict in order to reach the goal of power, but in this case, pvp IS the game. You PvP, its what you do. The cash shop gives players the opportunity to buy fancy customization, clothing, cars, gun skins, you name it its there, but it also has straight up weaponry available. If you so choose you can enter the game, and without having done anything, buy a gun who's statistics are on par with a gun that would take hours upon hours upon HOURS of someone who isnt paying for a premium subscription to achieve, and not just because of the cost, but because of the fact that you have to unlock them before purchase. This means that everyone who has bought a gun has an immediate advantage over everyone else, while this may not be very detrimental to a game with more of a PVE focus, this game is ,as I have said far too many times at this point, purely pvp. This means that every person that has bought a gun is not only making the game easier for them to play, but it is hindering the possibility to actually progress through the game for others. If other words, if all I can fight are people with fully modded guns, and I'm say, a level 20 bronze player, then I wont be able to level up very quickly at all, wont be able to get any kills to progress the games statistic based weapon unlock systems for certain guns, and therefore basically can't play the game effectively lest I pay to buy those same guns.    And Now for some less connected problems.      Problem #4: Server issues    This game has had some of the WORST server performance I have ever seen. With sometimes constant rubberbanding, lag, and general connection issues, it can make the game a downright pain to handle.  To be honest, I used to love this game, even with some of the flaws it had and still has. The guns are fairly interesting, the cars handle uniquely, the customization is one of the game's strong points being one of the BEST customization systems that you can experience in a video game, and even the quirky limitations of the game, such as the lack of head shots or any articulation based hitboxes (everyone has one, uniformly sized hitbox). But to be honest, without paying a metric â¥â¥â¥-ton of money, you are severely limited by the players who do. The community is awful as well, with hack accusations being dropped like raindrops in a storm.  The game just isnt worth it in the long run for the amount of crap you have to go through to get anywhere.  Maybe someday. Maybe someday.
10773	1	a	Very fun, but I wouldn't recommend this game if you have a short temper.
10462	1	a	Great F2P Game!!
3383	1	a	Been playing this for a few weeks now, enjoying the GTA like game in a mmo style, try it :)
9940	1	a	alot like fallout. all in all a great game
7408	0	a	Alot of potential but awful implementation.  The gameplay is quite fun if you get matched against an even team but machmaking is quite bad in this game it will match you up against higher lvl player again and again wich can be frustrating as hell.  Also the higer lvl weapons are quite a bit better so if your medium to low lvl the frustration can be too mutch. as your against more experienced players that know every nook and cranny but they also outgear you in weapons armor and equipment.  Also the ingame store is the saddest thing i have seen in my life it wil cost you euro`s to rent a bloody gun yes RENT wtf and as most guns are reskins of current guns your paying rent for a skin. But the store is the only way to get acces to higher lvl weapons so yes you can get most stuff ingame it wil take you 200+ hours to get to the good stuff or payup.  Also all the long range guns are way too powerfull an ak like gun does +- 160ish damage the most used sniper in the game does 950 so there are so many that even use it as a close combat shotgun.  Dont even get me started about grenade spam higher lvl`s even get to carry 3 grenades that do way to much damage.  Also this game reward cheesy gameplay as the losing team almost gets no XP, so expect every dirty trick/glitch people know against you.  And last but not least so many cheaters and i consider every change to the gamefile`s a cheat like the widely used tweaks to remove all the textures and shader adjustments to remove smoke, add outlines all so its easyer to spot people. adjusting crosshairs so they have one even if they are running.  and ofc the people with aimbots and stuff.  GamersFirst the company that runs the game has added almost noting since the game came out years ago in reality they should be called myBankaccountFirst.  on the positve side i wish all games had this degree of custumising your looks
3923	0	a	Now don't get me wrong, this game is absolutely wonderful, been playing this damn game for a few years now. So this is more of a reluctant unrecommended review. But anyways I'm pretty sure some other reviewer can fill you in better in the good stuff, so I think it's unecessary to talk about the areas where APB shines brightly with ease. So let me briefly cut to the chase.   What I dislike about the game:    Matchmaking is so bad it's laughable.   It's usually you or the opposition who is getting their arses kicked in the corner. A little less than occasionally there is a fair fight and well that's where the real thrill comes from it.    'I knew it, i'm surrounded by â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s.'   [Kudos to anyone who knows this quote] Trolls, Griefers, and Cheaters are pretty common around the servers.[Or perhaps i'm just unlucky?]   Golden Cash-Cows  If you see someone with Gold Status, chances are they're premium wh**es armed to the teeth with premium guns, rocket launchers, and impossible superior accuracy[Hacker?].   Ridiculous Real Prices  $50+ for your average/op virtual gun. $100+ for a friken tommygun. lol wut? I know that it's a free to play game, they have to get compensation, and I fully understand that. But ffs.   The small yet completely noticeable holes in customization  While there are nearly limitless possibilites of customization in the game, little things like gender/faction only clothing is so ridiculous it's annoying. I mean seriously? They have licensed vigilanties protecting San Paro and exterminating 'criminals' wielding automatics and rocket launchers, when it's CLEARLY the police and military's job, but a woman can't wear men-like clothing or look like a tomboy? One word, 'Why?'   What it says in the description.     'Constantly evolving gameplay and events, with new content added regularly'   Now that's a lie when I see one. Okay, yes they are in fact adding content, but really, it's usually just a small 'fix', or some stupid limited-time weapons and customization items that nobody really knows or cares about. And I may not know much about the videogame developing world, but I think it would be very.....VERY wise to prioritise actually FIXING the game instead of just force feeding us this money grubbing bullsh*t. Now I don't care about the money grubbing because lets face it, everyone is unfortunately starting to it. F*cking Rockstar, is also doing it with it's stupid GTA: Online project. Oh yeah btw that reminds me, WHERE THE F*CK ARE THE HEISTS!? -sigh- The point is, fix your crap up FIRST, THEN advertise how greedy your company's wallet is.   The Publisher: Gamersf*ckingfirst  They're horrible at their job. Customer service is stupidly horrible, they are ALWAYS coming up with these annoying ideas of creating overpriced items and services to get your hard-earned money and let the rich little a-holes who pay, dominate us, and they just bring the cute little irony monster out with their cancer building name.   In conclusion?  Despite the mentioned, I actually still suggest trying this game out if you're an experienced fps/3rdps or at least have a good aim. If you do not have any of these qualities, I still recommend trying APB: Reloaded out, the thing is what I have to say to you is that you should not expect too much and double check on what you're getting into.
8903	0	a	Combat seems very basic, npcs stand still till you get close enough and the menu system isnt as user friendly as other games. I dont see how this was ever a pay to play game.  Has good theory but isnt pulled off, the world has no life to it.
1810	1	a	Pretty fun game, slightly repetitive, very microtransaction-based... But still pretty good quality for a FTP game.
3106	1	a	Cops and Robbers, the MMO. The price is certainly right and like TF2 you can have a fun time without spending a dime. The customization is pretty amazing and shows just how much time went into making this game; making it's lack of initial success back in 2010 all the more sad. You can play in a group or on your own, it's all good.
10724	1	a	Realm of the mad god is a pixelated version of DIablo
2214	1	a	Have lost tones of hours of my life in this game.But it deserves that.Only con so many cheaters and glitchers.
10873	1	a	Quite possibly a one-of-a-kind-game. That alone makes this one worth playing once (or if you're like me, for hours). I've never played anything quite like this title and I doubt you have either. It has simple MMORPG style character customization, fast and frantic arcade style shooting, and perma-death. That's right, this is an MMO with perma-death. And yes, you WILL die (many, many, many times. I suggest you get used to the idea). Death is a part of this game and should be expected. Gear is largely transient(but still important in it's own right), and not hugely important as gear is trumped by skill. What's this you ask? An MMORPG where skill trumps gear? Quite welcome if I do say so myself. The game also has a very elegant solution to make 85 strangers want to play with one another. This title is one of the few I've ever played that offers TRUE coop, that works, and works very well with each player rewarded equally. The cash system is also ACTUALLY completely optional.
10745	1	a	This game is not a very forgiving game in any form. Those that take the high risks get the High rewards, but in a perma-death game, the rewards are easily gone with a simple mistake. After 60 hours of playing thi\s game, you hope to have a clan that will back you up, you get some of the best gear, and don't die by a Night Elf. Micro Transactions will get you the best gear in the game, but that takes more of the fun out of it. If you spend your coin (real life cash) then unly by from special deals, and make it storage or extra character slots, things you can keep after death.
8054	0	a	Was good, and fun. I was pretty high rank, at about 195. But somehow my account got banned for no reason. Contacted both Gamer's First and Punkbuster support. No help given. Lost about $200-$300 worth of lifetime equipment.
5428	0	a	Don't even bother.
5677	0	a	Pay to win. To many overpowered items and features for people who spill out hundreds of dollars into this game. Was really fun at first but then it got very repetitive.
8244	0	a	Played at launch and didnt mind it although very buggy it was populated and fun. Had about 320hours logged there untill I gave it a break. Came back to the game about a month ago still seems very similar but the population?? Holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ I always felt like I was playing a single player game not an mmo. Most people I ever found in a district was like 5 no matter where I went. The sheer lack of population is the reason im not recommending, if more people were playing its a damn fun multiplayer experience but as it is now its a boring ghost town so dont bother.
9311	0	a	I can't login to the game! Tell me how to login it... :( 
4187	0	a	You will play the game.. You will encounter many Hackers... You will rage your little heart out.. But in the end... You will always have a craving to play the damn game..  EDIT: Just kidding.. You will hate everyone.
470	1	a	APB : R is a fully functional and versatile 3rd Person shooter. One can say that it's a Free to play but revamped version of Gta's Cop And Robbers.   You could be your own in design and music.   -Customizing your character to fit your own unique style. -Creating your own ingame music to listen to on the radio or as your death theme for your enemies that tread in our path. - And Using the tools in your arsenal in combat to destroy and rebuild. (*Repair Gun*)  To me because the game allows soo much that it has the possibility to become bigger than it already is, A new engine is coming out and possibilities are being unlocked. Don't get dragged behind, Gear up and be as awesome as you are today.  BECOME THE HERO SAN PARO DESERVES OR THE VILLIAN IT REGRETS . -Jam
1750	1	a	Surprisingly fun.
8225	0	a	The game was okay, at first. Open(ish) world, tons of customization, lots of options for starter guns.  Then i played for a while. Missions are dominated by players with money, and the games skill rating matchmaking doesn't factor in Pay to Win guns that are leaps and bounds above what you can buy with in-game currency.  If you have money to blow, i say give it a shot. If you plan on being a free player, i say stay away.
7734	0	a	This online game look like GTA.In fact,the gane just killing each other in a open world city.It's also buggy and boring.  Windroid's Recommend Score : 58/100
372	1	a	I found out about this game through my 'random links' method on Youtube (I click mindlessly untill something of interest pops up). It was a video made by a guy called Rapid99 titled 'A Day of Impromptu Traffic Collisions'         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  APB: Reloaded - A Day of Impromptu Traffic Collisions&nbsp;
4511	0	a	APB is Pay to win big time
1548	1	a	This game is for those that don't have the money to get GTA. It's mostly P2W as most cool features are for members only, but if u can deal with that then the game isn't all that bad.
3851	0	a	The medicore gameplay and seemingly limitless customization gives the game extreme potential (nothing beats driving a windowless white van with 'free candy' painted on the sides), but the blantly underscored Pay2Win business model and the imbalance it creates for players will cause you to rage so hard that your blood pressure and body temprature will rise high enough for your insides to become Oblivion and you â¥â¥â¥â¥ diamonds.  It's a damn shame: expanding the objectives in the game's missions and retooling the buisness model to make it more fair could really unlock a good bit of that potential.
4390	0	a	APB is like Donald Trump, exciting and amusing at first, but once you get past the bull â¥â¥â¥â¥, it starts to dawn on you how bad they are.  I've had history with this game, and decided to come back. I was bored and needed something to do. Here's a synopsis of how a day in APB goes. 1. Take 30 minutes to log in. 2. Spawn into the world and I become Nightcrawler, with the ability to teleport short distances. 3. Steal a car, try to drive, go across everything but the road. 4. Ready up for a mission, it's a 1v1, guy is already at the objective as we start, i'm 200m away. 5. I meet up with the enemy with my default weapon, fps and lag cooperate to make me spray like hell and somehow get a kill 6. Repeat. 7. Enemy corner Camps objective. 8. He wins. 9.

1546	1	a	It's like a free multiplayer version of gta iv. Works pretty good, but missions can be a little basic and very repetitive. Still its a good time killer.
8136	0	a	Totally waste of time... Free to Play games should be banned from Steam....grinding and money draining as we are going to work to be ripped off whilst spending some time with our hobby! If you want do do a favour to yourself leave F2P games to old people on Mobile Phones!

6055	0	a	Lags as â¥â¥â¥â¥, horrible pay to win, and too much g1c for a single weapon. Would play again.
6422	0	a	AMAZING GAME!!! but its so pay to win its impossible to play!
8510	0	a	Used to be alright, now it's â¥â¥â¥â¥
5591	0	a	the type of game where they charge stupid prices for the good stuff
1647	1	a	Not the most riveting game of all time. It's VERY much a grind, the community is HORRIBLE, mostly just trolls and not only do the mods and GMs not care about trolling, they take an active part in it. They SAY cashshoping is 'balanced' and doesn't give cashshoppers an unfair advantage, but that SO isn't true.  The good, though? Pretty much unparalleled customization. Customizable clothes. Customizable cars. Even customizable MIDI-ish themes you opponent hears when you kill them.  This game seems to love to tap into that primal part of your brain that makes you want to show off your decaled-up car to the masses.    It's a time-killer, but definitely not something I'd pay money into. But that's just me. Paying into it apparantly DOES help the game progress faster... no joke, it gives you extra 'standing' and money.
5963	0	a	this is a bad game. buy gtav idiot.
5346	0	a	Just get any Saints row or GTA game, its better then APB in everyway, don't get me started on the hit detection.
9698	0	a	This â¥â¥â¥â¥ hole of a game is Pay to Win. The company â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ on the small guys and shows the subsriptioned players with everything. Nice 'Free' 2 play. They guys are just like EA
2865	1	a	APB: Reloaded.... Where to start, a fast action pace 3rd person shooter (Left or Right arm angle) Drive Cars, Shoot People, Collect Cash, Upgrade ur weapon/car &amp; Customize EVERYTHING! Its great game but very rage based in the fact that competition is so high.
8706	0	a	great game, however, still awful controller support, down right unplayable for those who don't use keyboard and mouse
2206	1	a	Endless playing. Very dynamic. You can never get bored playing, theres lots to do
3148	1	a	this is the version of GTA. it is holy fun
4564	0	a	Awesome concept terrible execution - be prepared for horrendous combat and vehicle mechanics with the only consolation being the in-depth customization of both personal vehicles and player avatars.
2186	1	a	Very fun, very exciting and it makes me hard! This game has so much to it, there is almost never something to not do, but warned little wallets, they vant ur moneyz I do not recommend purchasing ANYTHING for this game, it's a free game, it's fun to keep it that way
568	1	a	Sure APB Reloaded has it's up's &amp; down's but personly I recomend this 3rd person shooter for anyone who like's PVP game's. You might feel like you suck but after you play it for a few hour's you will get used to it so before you give up, give it a try and see what you think.
342	1	a	GTA V for pc but better... and it's free :D
7558	0	a	Basically, if GTA was an mmo and was pretty dull and just generally boring with near nothing to do and pay-to-win weapons.
2979	1	a	Really fun game, although I heard there's a lot of slowdown issues if your PC isn't from the last year or two. Personally, I like the Criminal side better - but Enforcers are fun to play as well. PVP is fun, however there's a few tweaks that could be made. For example, hitting someone in the head with a gun does the same damage as if you'd hit them in the foot, therefore making snipers almost useless - (or overpowered, depending on your stance - missing the head now works better11) that's my main gripe. Other than that, the customization options are awesome, the music is great and it's a fun thing to play with friends :D 8/10.
10306	1	a	I havent played much of fallen earth yet but i can allredy tell it is going to be a very awesome game and experience....keep up the good work on your games....also if you are having trouble sighing up then waht you have to do is make another e-mail account, i know you may not want to do it but this game is defenitly worth it.
7846	0	a	Still Looks very glitchy not good.
5543	0	a	My hairline cutter made me play this â¥â¥â¥â¥. It was legit, but one flaw. I try to noscope someone and it doesn't work. Wtf? This is the worst game i've played since call of duty ghosts. I feel like i just cut both of my wrists while making a remake of GTA. ok? Stop trying to make a GTA and get a life. if i cant make yawspeed, what is life? i cant 360 just by pressing Q? WTF! This is the worst. @FaZeRain @FaZeAdapt @FaZeApex @FaZe Banks @Faze Blaziken. I hope that this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ on in 2 hours. I am not ever going back to my Hairline Cutter AGAIN, because he told me about this â¥â¥â¥â¥. before you get this game please look at this..... @EverySteamMemberThatViewsThisStorePage
4497	0	a	Here is what I think. APB Reloaded is a good Game, but I feel that I should both critisize and nit pick a lotta things about this game  One is the SMG charging and the repeditiveness to lose to another player because of the overpower of the SMG's in the game. It is so god awful and OP, It made me stop playing this all together. People would just â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sprint at you, boomboom â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ you're â¥â¥â¥â¥ed. They do it with shotguns even. It's stupid as all â¥â¥â¥â¥, also, the new Argotech ACES R&amp;D III is the most OP weapon in the game, and the most unfair, it directly hits, no need for anything else, no range no nothing. People running around with OSMAW Bazookas and silly Argotech ACES SMGs are cowards and are idiots for buying something for a cheap kill every five seconds.   Two is the Customization, specifically for males. I generally have a Randy Savage-Esque Character, but I want more than a Randy Savage look. I want to see hair that will SURPASS my shoulder/neck. I want to see long where is surpasses the shoulders to even the top half of the Pectoral. I really do not care what the general style of man is, give us that choice please. I have a problem with games that never seem to give a choice about Hair style for men, and just give the more mainstream stylings and as I repeat, absolutely sick of it. I want to see a helluvalot more.  Three is the Car handling, which is GOD AWFUL. Simple, It's so unecessarily hard. Go around a corner, you hit a brick â¥â¥â¥â¥ing wall in 12 seconds and then your dead.   Four... The â¥â¥â¥â¥ing unbalancing of the 'threat levels'. Bronzies all in one, but goldies and silvers mixed together... this game is way under balanced and stupid. it just is horrifingly â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. I kept on getting my â¥â¥â¥ handed to me because of the Goldies 'better skills' and there silly pay 2 win cheapo weaponry. This game HEAVILY relies on you having to buy weapons all the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing time and having them rented out instead of kept which is â¥â¥â¥â¥ing dumb. You basically are vulnerable as a cop or a criminal. Oh but the Enforcers (cops) have all the advantages of quickly getitng everything. Yeah. The Goods It's Free, so if you are looking for a filler game, go ahead, get this It has the Best customization, despite what I say about Male customization. Sometimes, you can win by using simple weaponry and stuff. SOme of the Pay 2 Win items are pretty good if you think about it. Most importantly, it is a co-opish game, so you can play with friends  Overall, If I were to rate tis on a simpler basis, it would be atleast a 5/10 Because of the new crap that G1 and Reloaded added.   Thanks Reloaded, you guys do not know anything about fairness.  Edit: I am putting on the thumbs down, but it's your choice. at this point I am in the middle. ANd the reason there is so much bad is BECAUSE this game has too many rage inducing moments and the
1563	1	a	much die so law enforcement  very MMO wow.
3415	1	a	This game is oodles of fun. But don't let that mask the greediness of the people of Gamers First. Yes this game does intail all that it says. But you have to 'pay' for more then half of them. Customization, Permement and Exclusive Guns, Cash and Progression (Exp) bonuses, Car Parts, Symbol creation, and I'm sure there is lots more you will find.   Premium (Which entails Bonus Cash and EXP, Symbol/Car Customisation and... I think that's it.) costs 799 G1 credits which ammounts to 10$ US total. But that I beleive is the beta price. Because the image has a 1199 (15$ US) crossed out in the back which makes the current price a special and assuming it doesn't last until it's fully released.  Permament/Premium guns. Guns can range in price from 17$ all the way up to 60$. 60 Dollars! I cannot fathom who decided to begin the price range like that, but for G1 to agree on it takes the cake. These guns are character bound. So if you want a gun on your Criminal and Enforcer then your lookin at 120
10010	1	a	I like this game, it's very easy to play.
8156	0	a	A great Game!!! But not really much fun for Free to Play People. There are to much Bonuses for others. Not well balanced. But the Gameplay and Concept is a Plus to look at it closer. Free to play Titel 6/10.
5545	0	a	That moment when ur teammate tries to kill u so u unload 3 magazines of your assault rifle into him and blow up a car in front of him but he walks up to u 2 seconds later and uses his pay 2 win gun to kill u in less than 1 second xdxdxdxdxd
7023	0	a	This game is nothing short of terrible. Was fun initially, then just went to hell VERY fast. Sad thing is this game had potential, but also has developers that suck.
5964	0	a	not for low grade computers
3745	1	a	It's a great game that i have played for a lot more hours then this indicates, by like 50x. but what made me stop playing originally (even though i've just come back) is the hackers, the crashes and mostly hackers at the time.  I still think this is one of the most impressive MMO's ever made and i hope i can enjoy it a bit now that i am back. do recommend that people try the game
5259	0	a	it's really puss like and would not recommend
667	1	a	Not revamped, not rejigged, not redesigned. Reloaded. APBâs new suffix is apt, as this free-to-play reincarnation of 2010âs deflated cops and robbers MMO is a retread of the same ground. The same drab city, the same hollow combat, the same lopsided results. The original city of San Paro has been left standing, a monument to badly judged level design and the colour grey. The first gameâs devs, Realtime Worlds, intended the place to live and breathe. Instead, it spluttered a few times before its life support failed. Its resurrection is a miserable one. Reloadedâs missions usually pit two small squads of human-controlled criminals and enforcers against each other, asking them to perform a multi-stage series of mini-jobs. One team has to drive to a place, collect a thing, and deliver it somewhere else. The other team has to stop them. Occasionally this leads to the kind of scenes that flicker through the minds of non-players when you describe APB to them: high-speed chases through busy streets, lastsecond jumps into getaway cars. Most of APBâs problems remain in Reloaded. It even inherited a few new ones, as it is currently seeded with cheaters. The original game was arguably killed too soon, so the switch to free-to-play means interested parties should at least take a weekend city break back to San Paro. But this is no revitalisation â APB Reloaded is rehash, replication, and repetition.
2772	1	a	this is a really good game if you want to play a game like gta 5 but dont have the cash to fork over. 8/10 overall
10789	1	a	DON'T READ THIS. YOU WILL BE KISSED ON THE NEAREST POSSIBLE FRIDAY BY THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE.TOMORROW WILL BE THE BEST DAY OF YOUR LIFE. NOW YOU'VE STARTED READING THIS. DON'T STOP.

5812	0	a	I dont like this game anymore cause i have good internet and its just crash game and you have to have money cause its stupid to start with out money
911	1	a	The game is great! i love it. The only things i think it needs are  -first person mode -melee weapons (knife, bat etc) -a selectable option that makes you pay %200 more money to buy a weapon permanetly instead of for 10 days -mission select and mission vote (to vote for wich mission you want) -more damage on headshots (I REALLY REALLY WANT THIS PLEASE ADD) -when you get to natoriety 4, enforcers (any enforcer) can kill you -more opertunities to get weapons permanetly without using G1C (level rewards, mission rewards etc)
2109	1	a	This game is really cool and i know its been out for a while but if u havent tried it plz do.
7835	0	a	Id say it was fun to play and uninstall but the game wont even load properly dispite multiple attempts on several different methods of download. If your looking for a game that doesnt load properly then this is the game for you!

8452	0	a	4 years ago I wrote a review regarding this title and as those 4 years have come and gone I hold a different opinion on this game. APB: Reloaded is a cops and robbers shoot em' up featuring loads of customization from tattoos, cars, guns, music, and of course your character. Now on paper it sounds like a solid idea and I will say it is but I have a few gripes. Like and other lesser know F2P title this game relies on micro-transactions (not forced thankfully) that are a little stupid. You want to own a gun perminately well throw some G1C down (in game currency) and your all set. Besides that matchmaking is more barren than a woman in her 70s I will sometimes by luck find a district full of 7 people or a measely 2 which is not exciting at all. All though im torn with the idea I can't recommend this game to really anyone sorry APB.
3786	0	a	APB 2012 Veteran with a level 255 gold enforcer and a 180-190 rank Crim. I know what I'm talking about. I have about 400 hours on my main steam account followed by about 1000-1200 on my G1 Launcher account. A good 400-500$ down the drain unfortunately   The Cons / Game Breakers / 90% of this game  - The worst matchmaking I have EVER seen in my life is ANY game. I've seen two silvers ( noobs ) with probably about 50 hours combined with a gold with maybe 70-90 hours at most ( At most, 190 hours combined ) go against 3 golds with over 8000 hours combined. I'm just speechless.  - Cancerous community. The most common type of cancer among the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ of San Paro is no doubt griefers  ' The best way to avoid the cancer is to become the cancer ' - a fellow anonymous San Paro enforcer  - The last 15 â¥â¥â¥â¥ing updates taking place once a month have been Joker Boxes or an Arma$$ marketplace update  - I wouldn't mind spending 1-5$ for a gun reskin, 10$ at most for a super cool gun skin.. but they're â¥â¥â¥â¥ing 40$ FOR ONE. EVERYTHING on the â¥â¥â¥â¥in marketplace is overpriced. Admitedly they ARE cool though. It gets quite annoying when the last 15 updates in a row have been simply paid 40$ reskins of guns.  - Corrupt developers. Proof :         YouTubeâ¢ Video:  Revoemag the corrupt GM&nbsp;
5657	0	a	The game is not great, and the hackers in the early days ruined the experience for most, but in the end this was still one of the greatest role play experiences I have ever had. The customization options allow for true diversity as well, and if not for the money grab that G1 calls their Free 2 Play / Micro-transactions, this game would be one of the most impressive in history. Instead it falls flat, as was clearly evidenced by the complete lack of reception when RTW introduced it at E3 in 2010.

4163	0	a	If cancer was a video game it would be this one. No hit reg, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ machanics, dumb pay to win guns, terribly optimized, cheater rampant, you wont be competitive enough with the losers who try their asses off abusing broke game features until you have put at least 500 hours into the game and gotten what should have been starter guns. Many of the 'best players' have been aim hacking for months if not years, and use the game as a platform to boost their ego. The developers have run this game into the ground and are milking what little money they can from it until even the nolifes with 10,000 hours realize this game isnt worth playing anymore.

10020	1	a	After hundreds of hours invested in this game I can say it's fun, but there are enough flaws to drive away the majority of players. The development of this game stalled after about two years, leaving a playable but unsatisfying experience overall. There are several zones to explore in this game, each offering many different types of missions and rewards. The final zone is a half finished area only accessible by players who have reached the level cap.  Over the years content has been added, including pvp and pve content, allowing players to enjoy hundreds of hours of entertainment. Some of the fixes and additions frustrated some of the more experieenced players and made it nearly impossible for new players to realy enjoy anything beyond the first parts of the game.  Leveling is slow going without help from experienced players. With the right help it's possible to reach the level cap in two days or less. Reaching the skill point cap is a different matter. Plyers will need to dedicate at least a hundred hours to optional races that award points that will improve their character's 'build'. It's important to choose the right build and figure out how to exploit the various skill sets. WIth the right skill set players are able to dominate pvp matches and earn death toll. These pvp points can be spent on power-ups and gear that can't be purhcased or crafted. Some of the pvp gear can be purchased through the auction house for a considerable sum.  Making money is pretty easy with the right recipes. Selling items such as ammo and fuel at the auction house makes it possible to eran money farely quickly, but the best money comes from selling serendipity items and boss loot. Although the best gear and weapons come from earning death toll, the next best thing is crafted with rare and unique items found in the later zones.  I definitely recommend this game for someone looking for a open-world rpg. Although the game is free to play it isn't pay to win. Premium membership does have it's perks though. WIth a minimal premium purchase players can reach the level cap in a few hours, but most premium items are purely cosmetic. Respec injectors are overpriced, so I recommend using guides to make an ideal build from the start. RPG players that enjoy fps games will have may ours of enjoyment even if the graphics are pretty dated.
8436	0	a	Edit: Basically take all my negative aspects of this review and amplify them and you have an up to date review...  APB: Reloaded is a online 'Cops-and-Robbers' third person shooter game. Gameplay revolves around joining one of two factions, the Criminals or the Enforcers, and then competing in open-world objective-driven missions throughout various districts in the fictional city of San Paro.  Gameplay: The core gameplay of APB is what drives it. It takes an old classic concept (Cops vs. bad guys) and puts a whole new spin on it. Customization of your character is incredibly vast. You can personalize your character's appearance, vehicle, 'theme song,' graffiti logo, and weapon (to an extent.) The physics in the game are a bit exaggerated which often lead to funny, if not frustrating moments. Combat can be fun if you know what you're doing or are playing with people at your skill level.   In that regard, APB does have a match-making system that's good at generally picking out who's a newbie (bronze level) and who's a pro (gold level), but once you get down into it the game just pushes silver players and gold players together which can be frustrating if the game misinterprets whether the player is actually ready to be in that bracket. FINALLY, and this is important. The game does have pretty shameless elements of P2W (Pay 2 Win.) There are weapons that can only be obtained through purchase with actual money and do provide a decent advantage over players who don't pay anything.  Visuals: Graphics hold up decently to more modern titles. While there's certainly no comparison to the next-gen iteration of Grand Theft Auto V, APB took a smart route by utilizing a more cartoon-y look. It's not a photo-copy of reality, but it's not trying to be. That said, it still looks quite good.  Community: This is something that needs to be said about this game. The community is, by-and-large, not the friendliest group of people on the planet. This is partly to be expected from the players of a game where crime, and stopping it by whatever means necessary, is the name of the game. However, I'm not sure I know of a game with more trash-talking and general inconsideration this side of Call of Duty. Asking for help will either get you scoffed at, or given just enough help to get by, and THEN scoffed at. If you want to play with a group of people who aren't ego-maniacs or raging craphats, disable District Chat and invite your friends to play the game with you.  Overall: Don't get me wrong, this game was a big part of my downtime during Spring Break. When trolls and tryhards aren't gunning you down continually with overpowered P2W weapons, this game is a ton of fun. Occasionally you'll find a match that actually accomodates your skill and everyone will be in the same boat as you, and you'll have a blast. Practice and you'll sometimes find yourself top of the scoreboard for a match or two. Just don't take it too seriously, it is afterall just a game. But if you're someone who prone to raging at video games to the point of breaking things, you might need to look elsewhere.
2543	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hate the game 95/100 percs
7114	0	a	This was good when I played it in the closed beta under RealtimeWorlds, but since it got taken up by Gamersfirst all it has turned into is a F2P with micro-transactions where paying gets you the best weapons and unlocks. I recommend to STAY AWAY from this game at ALL COSTS. The new dev/publisher has completely unbalanced the game's core gameplay by giving the premium players the best weapons instead of allowing everyone to gain and maintain the use of the weapons, not to meantion the overpowered premium vehicles compared to the free ones. This game was designed by RealtimeWorlds to be a Single-payment game - you by the disk/game key and that would be all you pay. This new system, as I've said already, has BROKEN the the game's CORE GAMEPLAY.  Score out of ten when under RealtimeWorlds: 8.5 Out Of 10 Score out of ten while under Gamersfirst: 2 Out Of 10  AVOID
10124	1	a	This game offers lots to do for mmo gamers at every level. The maps are large and look the part. Enemies vary to keep things interesting and generally fit in their environment on the map. Crafting is a HUGE part of this game and can be time consuming but it is done in a way that players can queue up tasks for offline time. Character can be built with skills chosen by the player and customized to fit playstyle. Quests are available in the game but are optional.  Personally the crafting element of the game is my favorite. It brings together the need to scavenge and find the parts you need to craft to advane further into the game.  If you enjoy a sandbox mmo that doesn't marshal you through it's world from start to finish and you enjoy the genre, I would recommend trying this game.  (This review is based off playtime from before the game was offered on Steam, I just recently switched to the Steam version)
5588	0	a	If you can actually log in its ok
2180	1	a	one of the best games i have ever played its fun to play i Recommend it to everyone
1471	1	a	its a berry good game and its free.
7220	0	a	It's not really that great to me...but that might just be the lag I get...
3989	0	a	Fun game the first hour or two, after that its pretty much aids. Since Gamersfirst like any other F2P companies decided to make the game P2W and â¥â¥â¥â¥ up the matchmaking system, its pretty much just a pain in the â¥â¥â¥ to play.  Customization is the only good thing about this game atm.  3/10, since the graphics are pretty ok.
8223	0	a	&gt;Game crashes on startup &gt;Still keeps running according to my profile &gt;Actually have 49 hours of playtime when I dont even know how the game looks like TOPKEK
6725	0	a	First i would like to say this is one of the best games out there despite the Pay for more mindset of this game. costumization is crazy deep detailed but the default substcription you carry as a new player limits you to 25% of this games costumization capabilities. that aside there is also very anoying mechanics in this game specially playing as a bandit or criminal. a enforcer can handcaff you from miles away limiting your abillity to fight back or even try to brake restrains. little things like this are game braking. i havent spent much time in this game to give you a detailed idea of everything in this game. another thing that really bothers me is the community simply because its mostly filled with a very young community fan base. it bothers me i have to go online and play with 10 year olds. this game has the potencial to be the best game on steam for GTA fans and i think if taken in the right direction it would surpass GTA in many ways. i recommend it for a casual gamer not someone thats looking to take the most out of this game becouse that? .... well thats just impossible unless you â¥â¥â¥â¥ gold bars.......

5874	0	a	At the beginning it is fun but after a few hours you start to meet alot of people who have payed for better items and are beating you only because they have better stuff.
4011	0	a	1st take - If you're not willing to spend real money it is pretty much unplayable. Hacking,macro cheating, and golds purposely farming lowbies galore. Maybe if G1 got their act togethor i would say its a worthwhile game...but they're making to much money off the p2w guns to even care.  2nd take - Fairfight solved some of the hacker problems, but i still would not recommend this game yet. Only good thing going for it at the moment is the sheer amounts of customization. But there is still to many glaring problems that needs to be addressed.  1.Matchmaking - The matchmaking in this game is atrocious, it makes leagues matchmaking system look flawless ( and thats bad) . Odds are you will be placed against people who are gold and R255 while you are just starting out. (even if you go to bronze servers they're still there)  2. Armas Weapons - This is the big one, Armas weapons is a double edged sword. Yes it is whats keeping the game afloat since it brings in revenue. But also its whats making the game completely unbalanced. Though i would think this could be easily fixable by adding ranks to the armas weapons, so a brand new character cant run around with a shaw 'first blood'.  3. This ties into 1, but the fact golds can stay in bronze servers. This could be easily fixed that once you hit gold you are automatically booted out of the server.  4.They need to find a way to hire actual GM's , cause there's is a load of people who need to banned just for the way they act in this game. If players were actually afraid of losing all their work and the real money they spent on armas. Maybe the community would be less toxic.  These are only some of the problems, maybe after these are fixed i could actually approve this game to new players.
1787	1	a	GET IT OF U LUV GTA 
4149	0	a	Do i recommend this game to other players? no. why?  1.Match Making system is bad (Example: a player played the game for 50 hours can matched with a player who played 800 hours.  Another example if this game is like League of Legends, they are making bornze fight platinum or gold fights diamond)  2.hackers (Some top rank players can be hacker)  *3.They want money ( what i mean is that fix the game is not their primary, they made more things to buy and try to attract more players)  4.Bad performance(Server like waterfount is not stable, ping jumps from 50 to 500)  But if you want to know the good side of this game, here is what i found.  1.customize ( custom your clothes , your car , your music , or the troll music that the player gonna hear it after you kill them.)  2.you are playing with 100 people ( The idea of have a free world and your battles can be any where in the map is great and the missions can get effect by other players that have nothing to do with you is interesting, it makes you feel you are playing a lots of people not just a server with 10 people in it)  3.Freedom( There is more other then just doing missions,  you can play fight club if you don't feel like to finish a whole match, that you can quit any time you want and you will still get rewarded.  Or you just don't feel like you want to fight, you can just drive in the free world or you can go to social district talk to other people, looks at other people custom maybe get some new idea and use on your own, trade, make your self look more badass or cute, make some music etc)  4.Is a mixed game , it can cover a lot( Is a shooter game but is also a driving game, it can even be strategy game or a rpg, it have skills on character , guns , and cars . It have a lot to explore)  And that is the good side and the bad side of this the game. I would say if you do not have the patience then this game is not for you, the good stuff doesn't come if you can't pass it's dark side first . However if you have patience and are interest what it have to offer to you, you can try but no guaranteed you will get what you want.
8709	0	a	Okay it is a good game totally right but it is always kicking me outta game :( It is not the reason of my 'recommendation'
6280	0	a	Played it.. sucks. Too many things happening, crappy controls, ugly graphics.. not worth 'Free to Play'
1919	1	a	It is like the best game 
9434	0	a	crashes on loading screen. i have the specs. game got the bugs.
8739	0	a	Best Horrible Game so Far ...
5278	0	a	this game blows even for a free to play game
3318	1	a	This Game is MAJOR Pay-2-Win, the Anti-Cheat System Sucks and there is some Input Lag as well.  But if you can get past all that then the Game is somewhat Fun and Enjoyable with Friends. Just my Personal Opinion Though.   Final Rating 5.8/10
10131	1	a	Insidiously addictive. The Wild Wild West meets the Apocalypse.
10822	1	a	Here's my review on this game:  Pros: Is free, Is a permadeath MMO where you can find loot, You can make a guild, You can play with your friends easily with the 'Lock' thingy  Cons: If you don't pay it's awfully slow to lvl up Is basicly Pay to win 'Beginners Package' pops up everytime you log in and sometimes it glitches to the edge of the screen where you can't close it, Once you die you're dead, Gold is hard to get in this game, You only start off with 1 charachter slot  Ornx summons EVERYONE, including lvl 1's to his castle which is really hard.  Overall I find this game very addictive so it's a 6.5/10
9828	0	a	  this game is horrible it was only letting me do the same things over and over again such as press play but it will not do anything and accept the terms of service
6634	0	a	Game is okay, nothing spectacular though
5315	0	a	This game sucks
7951	0	a	I never got to try the game because it never would respond when it was in the middle of starting.
10553	1	a	You die in this game more than you die in Dark Souls.
3998	0	a	A pretty below average game in my honest opinion. It not only uses an old Unreal Engine, but has many limits, in terms of draw distance, fake bloom effects and jagged shadows.  Even while having a powerful rig, this game will still run poorly, which may also explain the decreasing numbers of people playing the game. I know people who have played this years ago and are no longer able to handle the game due to terrible performance.  Theres a poor choice of missions in this game such as: Defuse bomb, Ramming, Stealing which is basically all a click 'f' to wait while this circle fills up to 100% and offers no challenge whatsoever.  However, props to RTW for creating a game with such amazing customization, like i've never seen before, and may be the only reason why i play this.
9258	0	a	sorry but thanks to problems starting the gamei uninstall then when i did the game workd fine but i allready uninstall it soo no im installing it again wating WAYSTING MY TIME DOING SOO NOW I HAVE TO WAIT 2 OR 3 AHOURS MORE!!!!!!!!!! AND I DONT EVEN NOW IF THE GAME IS GOOD CUZZZ I COULDNT PLAY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
2858	1	a	After playing this game for over 120 hours, I've finally realised that it is just a ploy for money. Having said that, I should also bring to light my very many laughs and good times I've had with this game. With the 'missions' and pvp so frustrating, the only redeeming quality of this game is customization. Filled with infinite possibilities, the game is fun, however tiresome and rage inducing. I'll have to give it a 6.5/10
9227	1	a	Just gotta love the crafting system they have implemented in this game. Totally love it!
3548	1	a	I guess it's not that bad.
9614	0	a	super boaring game, i dont recommend playing it.

3723	1	a	is this old? plz tell
3135	1	a	I LOVE THIS GAME!! I love everything about this game! I play it with my bro all the time and we are obssesed. I totally recommend this game. The only bad things about this game is 1. Mine takes SSOO long to open and play APB, but this isn't their fault, my computer just isn't very good. 2. Everything in the store on the Social District is so expensive! Again, not their fault. Players just sell items in the game for ridiculous amount of money xD
4833	0	a	The game is so buggy it says i am playin APB but i dont play it :( plz fix it
5611	0	a	if you play this game and waste money on it your the most â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ person ever . in this you can camp roofs and shoot noobs drive a car have SUPER LAG!. its really bad and the servers are hosted from the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing moon.
8010	0	a	the game is horrible and plz dont download this game   i thought it would be nice but WASTE and TRASH  space waste plzplzplz dont download this game
10615	0	a	I didn't like it.... The same music is playing all the time. I wish this game had multipile soundtracks. Also this game is filled with spammers what makes normal chatting impossible. But this is just my opinion. I am not really trying to stop you from playing this game.
10731	0	a	bad song bad everything
1313	1	a	good game , endless fun with friends and customization is awesome
4805	0	a	its honestly trash
4214	0	a	This game has a fantastic concept. Free, open-world, full customization of your character, go on missions with new people; all this stuff makes for a pretty fun game...but the game is extremely unbalanced. Because of this inbalance, it has caused more rage than it has fun. When you are matched against players that are on your level, it is very very fun. But the chances of this happening are extremely slim. Chances are, when you are starting out, you'll be against so players with better skill, better weapons, and better experience. If you don't pay for the bonus weapons, you're going to fall behind and it'll take quite a while for you to catch up to the players that you get matched with. Often times when I play this, I think about how much more fun I could have playing something else where the matchmaking isn't so imbalanced.
4655	0	a	APB Reloaded.  played it before. loved it nowdays its not a game i really like. it forces you to put money into it to be a more successful player in it. the optimization is crappy too. 
9059	1	a	this is bs i cant play this so i say its a 0/10
7548	0	a	won,t launch
8867	0	a	don't do it. its a good game and i've loved it for years however the past 6 months it's died and there's not much point in anyone playing. there are bugs which damage the game greatly and have been known about for years - but never fixed.  The GM's / devs put very little time or effort into the game anymore and it's barely supported by them. The game has a crash or a downtime every day, but still the cash shop sales are pumped out. I feel they are just milking it for as much money as they can, when it's no longer worth anyones time - let alone cash.
7447	0	a	Terrible. Game won't start 75% of the time. Errors...  Other then all that its goofy, Full of hackers, and everything cool or useful cost USD.
6091	0	a	Wont even launch wtf?... can anyone help me pls?
6261	0	a	Does it spread cancer? â Does it ruin your life? â Do you get called a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ every time you kill someone? â Does it have 255 level players with grenade launchers? â Is that grenade launcher op as â¥â¥â¥â¥? â Does it give AIDS? â Do you still want to play even though this game is full of â¥â¥â¥â¥? â
680	1	a	I've yet to spend a single cent of real monney in this game but I still have fun.
9081	1	a	This game has been out for a while, and, compared to other currently active MMOs, Fallen Earth does fairly well.  If you like the post-apocalpytic theme, crafting a variety of items, shooter action-rpgs, and playing with others, you should enjoy this one.  The aesthetics are pretty good, the equip-able armor and weapons are all visible on your character. The music and sounds are decent.   The controls are easy to familiarize yourself and, like most MMOs, the beginning tutorial is extremely helpful in establishing your bearings in the game world. The learning curve is moderate to challenging, depending on how familiar you are with MMORPGs and their mechanics.  Crafting is a very fun part of this game if you are into that - you can craft almost anything you see in the game world (which beats having to spend your resources on merchants. Within the first 2 hours I already was driving around in my own ATV. The gameplay is pretty good, however, it still remains fairly buggy in many areas. The AI has godlike sensors, able to detect and chase you across the map once you have aggro'd (hostile interaction) them.   Grinding in this game is actually pretty fun considering that the rewards are very reasonable and the variety in missions is very, very good - they aren't 90% fetch or find quests typical of many MMORPGs. Combat can be weird and clunky at times, and hopefully this will be improved, however, it has been a long time and these problems still remain.  If you can look past these bugs, and enjoy grinding and crafting in the post-apocalyptic setting, then give this game a try.   Recommend.
8053	0	a	hard to set up i uninstallled this game
7322	0	a	A great game with a super awesome amount of customization. However the pay-2-win model ruins most the game.
9715	0	a	I played it. Got renamed to a ridiculous name because my name offended the you know who. Then the same mod who had renamed me popped up in main chat to ask people to keep the discussion to game related Q&amp;A. I wasnt even chatting at the time, and the people who were were simply chit chatting. Apparently this is too much for this concentration camp of a game. No fun allowed. Only talk about the game.  I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hate this â¥â¥â¥â¥. Burn down every game company that manages its users like stupid cattle. God forbid giving personal details or talking about fun stuff. It might create you know, DISCUSSION. We dont want that. We want stupid morons who only talk about the game and pay their dues. Die. Eat it and die.
2890	1	a	Kinda cool! :D
7679	0	a	This game is NOT noob friendly. in APB reloaded, there is no sign of matchmaking whatsoever. it just compiles a random clusterâ¥â¥â¥â¥ of people to duke it out. which means if you're just starting out, you could easily be placed against someone who's been playing nonstop for months repeatedly. I tried to get on my feet in that game for 3 days, but every cent I earned went toward ammo or was lost in deaths to people who play nonstop and pay actual money for the good equipment.   also, I dare say that this is the single most infuriating game I have ever played. even more so than Call of Duty. I don't get angry easily, but this game angered me to the point where I threw my mouse across the room and shattered the damn thing. So, here's a warning. if you're angered easily, AVOID APB RELOADED  It's a shame, because the idea behind it had a lot of potential. I was really excited to see someone finally making a game like this where you could actually be the cop with custom cars and weapons. It had so much potential, but the absolutely terrible matchmaking and blatantly obvious pay to win strategy ruined the entire thing for me.  long story short: unless you're willing to spend an untold amount of hours on this game, all it's going to do is infuriate you. it's a gigantic avoid from me.
7468	0	a	Horrible laggy and hard to set controls for motionjoy the regular is ok but need some work
10441	0	a	i can't get in the actual game so i dont recomend it so much
5252	0	a	R.I.P. Wallet
7571	0	a	A glorified, pay to win version of cops and robbers in which to kill someone you have to run around like a madman and throw explosives at anything that moves. also, your guns do as much damage as flicking a pea.
3465	1	a	don't know why so much people whine about unfair MM, learn to aim its not harder then that, i have played 65 hours and still stomping people who is lvl 255, can do it with the first weapon to, they just don' realise how to aim and learn it.. it takes like 10 hours to understand the recoil in the game..
9955	1	a	My favorite part is when the starting sequence is completely invisible to me.
7746	0	a	Game was good when I first played now it's a glitchy â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ wreck driving system SUCKS matchmaking system SUCKS I made a cew criminal cause it had been so long I went into my first mission THAT SHOULDN'T BE IMPOSSIBLE and I got paired up against 3 high level players and me and a completely new person
9348	1	a	great story awesome gameplay
5462	0	a	Corrupt devs make this once amazing game an utter nightmare for any players wanting to sink 40+ hours into it.
6642	0	a	Every time I press the game steam says the games already running and i cant even get to the launcher
7346	0	a	A bit laggy even with my newly built gaming computer, not a lot to do in this game either, honestly.
9058	1	a	Best Apocalypse Sandbox MMO out there ... oh and it's Free 2 Play !
6001	0	a	P2W, cheater/'hacker' paradise  Good game if you can overlook the above
6849	0	a	Pay to win. Imbalanced. Full of hackers and bad attitudes.  Could be fun with private matchmaking where you can choose who you play, but it isn't fun at all.

8723	0	a	Worthless game with worthless developers. They ban innocent players rather than banning the actual hackers. I'll never recommend anyone to play this game even if it's free. You'll regret it whatsoever.

4796	0	a	9/11 Would uninstall again
9563	0	a	Why is this game so bad? It has to much crap to be good, I don't even know how to start. First off it looks like â¥â¥â¥â¥, it is â¥â¥â¥â¥. The mechanics is â¥â¥â¥â¥. The whole game i â¥â¥â¥â¥. Like normal games I atleast know waht to do, in this game I don't I just wander around like a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing idiot beacuse im clueless.
8507	0	a	its like a horrible version of GTA SA ONLINE.
5686	0	a	This is a game I wish I could love because who doesn't want to play Cops And Robbers: Online?  Sadly though, the game is absolutely broken by blatant, no apologies pay to win (which is a term I hear thrown around a lot but I have never found as relevant as with APB) policies, a pretty pronounced bias for the criminals, and flat-out meaningless 'matchmaking'.  Let me put it this way: after a one year hiatus, I came back and made a new character. As I was relearning the mechanics and how to play, I queued up for my first match and was pitted against a gold-ranked superhero who had a gun that killed me in two shots, a rocket launcher, and a machine gun for a secondary weapon. Only bother with this game if you have about a hundred bucks of disposable income that you want to spend on the in-game store.
9091	1	a	pretty good game wish more users
695	1	a	Really enjoyed my time with this game. It was a ton of fun to play with buddies. However, it is greatly hindered by its F2P model, which closely resembles a pay to win format. The hackers obviously do not help either...  Give it a try nonetheless. The hacking has probably been fixed by now. Probably...
10578	1	a	Its â¥â¥â¥â¥ing lit
4759	0	a	So much hackers and pay-to-win players you end up not knowing which is which
5180	0	a	Reloaded Productions put themselves i.e. ca$h over the community, don't bother.
6092	0	a	Game gives me an overdose of cancer
795	1	a	I adore the game! Yes it has its bugs and still will be developing throughout time, but its fairly fun for the free game it is. The character customizing and designing ideas is fabulous and the ideas of doing tasks for each boss is very interesting. I give this game 4 out of 5 Bazookas!
7345	0	a	The game is not bad but...  It is hyper casual; bullet drop/damage are completely silly. If you are looking for a tactical team based competative shooter with realism and skill continue your search or I recommend CS:GO. If you want to have fun screw around and just blow stuff up and play grand theft auto for free, this is your game.  The review may seem harsh but it isn't a bad game just know what you want from your games and play it!
4815	0	a	Glad that's out of my game list.
7857	0	a	Why cant i play it WHY!!!
5556	0	a	It makes me have to redownload steam and all my games, Also it gave my pc a virus.
2815	1	a	Despite APB's insane customisation options it's hampered by a too small a gameworld to play around in and repetitive missions. Hopefully future updates will rectify these issues, but until then this game is just 'OK'.
6916	0	a	Steer clear from this game. It is Pay to win.
6415	0	a	Should've left it in the dumpster where I found it.
7840	0	a	One Word:LAAGGGGGG!!!!!
5348	0	a	Pay to win up the â¥â¥â¥. Community is filled with furâ¥â¥â¥â¥ and ERP cancer. Mods have no clue about what the â¥â¥â¥â¥ they're doing. Hackers on a daily basis.  10/10, it's okay.
7918	0	a	It's fun without a doubt, but the player base is practically dead.  Any remaining players have the best gear and essentially gun down newbs or anyone at a lower level than them.
3728	1	a	APB is a game that has been around for quite a while on steam, its kept standards but has dissapointed at certain times. However i was and am willing to overlook this because of the freedom i gain by playing APB and how it can be enjoyed not only by just playing the game, but researching into events and new fun things to try! :D  Defintley recommend this game. :)
5415	0	a	this game is ballshit  
7021	0	a	This Game Eat â¥â¥â¥â¥. He dosent let me login.
10283	1	a	The Animations may be simple and the game may be buggy, but its a great game nun the less and if the smooth they animations and fix some of the bugs this game will be amazing. This game realy has some great potential.........ACE!!!!

8688	0	a	Before I start anything, play the game first, make your own decisions and then come back and read the reviews. Reviewers shouldnt tell you to play or not to play the game, its so the devs (and sometimes the players) can see what is good and or bad about the game.  ________________________________________________________________________________  With that being said lets begin, I will chop this review into 3 segments, in-depth pros, in- depth cons, some issues or insights and then my conclusion. ________________________________________________________________________________  Pros -----  - The game is smooth i was able to run the game on high settings with a PC that I spent $400 on (and all the parts were used as well) if you can sacrifice the graphics just a bit you can run the game at 70-90 fps, with the frame rate dropping only when there's a HUGE row of explosions happening all at once (which is very rare).  - The game is OPEN WORLD, the fact that you can run around causing havoc or if you're a goody two shoes you can silence that havoc, is amazing, there's so much you can do in this game, you can rob random citizens you can crash into a shop window and loot the store, or you can patrol the city streets looking for criminals to arrest, you can drive around recklessly or you can just cruise if that's your style.  - The Choice of preloaded music (while not ALL of it is my taste) really hypes you up when you're driving around looking for that cop to run over, And if that's not your taste then you can upload YOUR OWN MUSIC from your desktop using the in game browser to search for that folder full of music you probably got through illegal means...  - The options, this game is SERIOUS about its customizability, and I mean SERIOUS, not only can you edit the clothes you buy if you wanted, you can customize your car, your tattoos, your characters face, and body in general, you can create your own death song, for when you kill an enemy so they can hear your music mocking them when they just got blown away, there's an awesome market and bidding system that was catered for the player so they can find what they want easily and quickly, and every gun has an unlockable skin you can acquire through achievements or special events that are going on!  ________________________________________________________________________________  Cons -----  - Im gonna start off with the matchmaking, because it is the MAIN reason this game is deterring people away from continuing to play this game. The matchmaking sucks MAJOR OX â¥â¥â¥â¥. players are split into ranks Green, bronze, silver and then gold, each rank having a deeper ranking than the one before. The first time you load up the world and join you are automatically readied up, which is cool and you can quickly switch it off if you just wanted to roam around and see the sights. Your first day in your Green ranked, once a match has started you and your team will fight against another team and guess what, most of the time they are all GOLD, yes GOLD the highest leveled player against a player who JUST joined, and this isn't gonna stop now, no no no it'll keep happening over and over and over again till you quit because you're going 0 and 19 (K/D) if you delve in deeper into the server selection (on the advanced menu, where you can be specific on which server you wanna join) EVERY GOLD, and I mean EVERY, â¥â¥â¥â¥ING, GOLD, is on a bronze server. Its ridiculous, and they purposefully do this if you haven't noticed, the servers are spread out so each rank has their own server so bronze can play against bronze silver against silver and gold against gold, but no they don't give 2.5 â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ about that and just join in so they can rake up that nice money and achievements.  (more about it here:  http://steamcommunity.com/app/113400/discussions/0/357285562482069506/  )  - The weapon system, oh my god, the weapon system. When you first start off you're given this toy assault rifle, not only is it meant to only be able to kill an enemy bronze, but you're stuck with it for most likely your entire play through, you won't make enough money to buy a new gun, which you can only own for 7-10 days UNLESS you spend a huge sum of money to own it permanently, which isn't that bad if you're making a lot of money.  - Game population, doing /pop in the game chat will show you how many people are playing in your US/NA server (last time I did it showed me it was only 300 players playing 300!! not all on one server no they are all spread out with the bronze server ranking about 80 players while the rest 220 are all dispersed into small 10 or 8 player servers)  - Flat our PAY TO WIN/FUN, if you ACTUALLY want to have fun in this game then you need to borrow your moms credit card. or if you can afford handing over your hard earned cash then go ahead, because this game is going to beat you and frustrate you and stress you enough to force you to hand over your cash. you want to get cool guns and cars? Money. Cool clothes? Money. Wanna customize your car to more than SEVEN, YES SEVEN SINGLE graphics to put on your car and or clothes)  - Community, the community is â¥â¥â¥â¥, its cancerous, and toxic, worse than 5-year-old Minecraft kids, worse than GTA V kids, and the entire LOL community combined. they are snobby, unhelpful, bigoted, racist, closed minded, rich edgy tweens and eugenes. if you are paired up against an entire team of gold and you die, god help you your team mate(s) isn't(arent) higher leveled than you (most likely golds) because if they are and you die EVEN ONCE you are going to get â¥â¥â¥â¥ on for than entire match because you a helpless new player was killed by a player that probably played this game for years. You are going to get called a 'â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ie' 'noob â¥â¥â¥' and 'fragits).    _____________________________________________________________________________  This game doesn't care about the bugs, or the hackers, or the community, or the game itself either. Its worse than a pyramid scheme. 'Gamersfirst' really should just become EA's snobby son. Regardless of all I said, (and if you actually read all of that then wtf is wrong with you) play the game, create your own opinion and write a review of it and send it to the devs. The ONLY way this game is going to change is by speaking to the devs and getting in contact with them, and just like EA the only language they speak is money, so to do that, the game has to either start DYING OUT which is going to happen very soon unless something changes or if they start losing people who are paying a monthly fee to be a premium. _____________________________________________________________________________

8072	0	a	This game was so bad, it made me write my first review and I've seen some pretty bad games in the years I was on steam  This game got some pretty nice customisation options and decent graphics, but that's about it. Get repetitive about 1 hour in. Worst...controls...ever. Not for solo player. Weapons can only be used for 10 days before breaking down(except the starting ones). Cars drive like a whale on a skateboard. Such a waste of potential...  Go play Defiance instead if you want a third person shooter mmo, better in everything save personalisation.  Ce jeu est tellement merdique que j'ai du Ã©crire une Ã©valuation pour la premiÃ¨re fois, et Dieu sait que j'ai vu de la â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ pendant toutes ces annÃ©es avec steam.  Ce jeu a de merveilleuses options de personalisation et de bon graphiques, mais c'est a peu prÃ¨s tout. RÃ©pÃ©titif aprÃ¨s une heure. Pires...controles...jamais...vus. Pas pour les joueurs solos. Les armes ne peuvent Ãªtre utilisÃ©es que pendant 10 jours avant de disparaÃ®tre(sauf celles du dÃ©but. Un beau gachis de potentiel.  Allez jouer Ã  Defiance Ã  la place si vous voulez un mmo de tir a la 3e personne, meilleur en tout sauf la personalisation(qui n'est pas pour autant mauvaise).

DONT GIVE IN TO THE JOKER BOXES BS EITHER!
1098	1	a	Pretty good game idk why u guys are so mean like yea it crashes it makes you play more, i dont feel like it makes me play forever im not so good at designs but i like it!!! 9/10
6971	0	a	This game kicked me from the server every time I joined one. I loved the look of this game but it won't even let me play it.
10735	1	a	it wont start it always just goes strait to a black screen. how do i fix that? 
6168	0	a	This game is too old need upgrade charaters,graphics and cars XD
2786	1	a	even tho their are hackers this game is great fun just to mess around on the phusics are comical i love this game
5538	0	a	  This is the perfect game if your standards are low or when your life isn't worth anything to you anymore
1907	1	a	Great game, near limitless possibilities for customization, a lot of potential, skill based shooting system, customized cars, clothes, songs, blasting pokemon random encounter music every time I kill someone... Greatness &lt;3
2914	1	a	Amazingly fun F2P MMO shooter. Best customization out of any game I have played.
6412	0	a	best character/car customization simulator ever. you can even make your own themes/songs/symbols too! thats great! i changed my appearances many, many, many times to suit my mood/tastes.  what's bad about it? everything else.  summary: - i played for a good 2 years since its closed beta - many game mechanics changes (some good, some bad) - very good time-waster - the grind is crazy. good news is, you will hardly feel it - learning curve for newbies? HELL. you will think everyone is hacking. yes there were many hackers in its early stages. now? probably just a few. but you will still think holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ everyone is hacking but they're not. they just have superb situational awareness (like you would play a MOBA). fast reaction time, memorized map and routes, and understanding of the game's wonky mechanics. seriously, for real. i know i would accuse people were hacking if i didnt already have thousands of hours clocked on this game. - car handling is wacky. takes some getting used to. - game physics are many lol moments. - fun to play with friends (all experienced clan mates? good. time to faceroll. all newbie friends/pubs? in for major butthurt) - game not p2w. all you can unlock can match payer weapons. (i was high ranked pure F2P) - most important reason not to play this game: the publisher, g1, is a lying, corrupt crook who cheats their playerbase. you won some g1 credits? DENIED. they no give you cuz you exploit their event due to THEIR wonky game mechanics. won anything else? DENIED. last minute event rule changes. wtf? many empty promises. i swear, no lies. - dwindling population + broken matchmaking = enjoy getting banged from behind by the vets. if that's your thing, play this game. otherwise, avoid.  -there is no PvE.  signed, honest confessions of a vet

9672	1	a	For all you Fallout lovers out there!
100	1	a	Hi,  Well it's been a while i've been playing this game as you can see..  In a resume.  A quick word about the community : You'll venture into different personnality  Some that you will have never thought to be friend with or that you would have never thought they would led you a chance to be friend with them ;  Others that you will regret having known;  Some that you will love with the deepest of your heart;  Be pleasant to others and they'll be pleasant to you otherwise if you're an â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ it will just ends up in like any other online videogames and you'll be ignored like a ghost.  -Gameplay-  A gameplay that you will never be able to experience anywhere else. Why?   Well there's a maximum of possibility to be done within this game. The possibilities of what you are capable of are the limits of your consciousness.  The character customization : you can make your own tattoos apply them where ever you want. You can decide to look like a brocoli with a green afro and a green skin tone by example.  Vehicle customization : Apply decals where ever it's possible in your field of view. Make it unique differ from the default style that you'll see in game. Make yourself noticeable while driving in the most well made customization. It takes patience but afterward you'll be rewarded for your efforts with positive comments in team chat while in a mission or group chat with your new friends you'll have created.  Clothing customization : Same as the others above..i've seen and met a lot of great artists in this game. Be kind with them they are argued and rushed by others to make requests and they'll get tired overall if you're abusing of them but other then that many of them are the most greatest persons i've ever seen in this game. Pleasant to talk with them.  Many variant driving style : Most of all the vehicles you'll drive in this game as a unique handling with time you'll get to know every of them and be drifting around with style dodging rockets of your enemies perfectly etc etc.  Combats: I've learned over time that you need to act wisely as you move towards your enemies. Detect their positions move with awarness of where they could possibly come from. Be prepared paranoy if you have to but not too much. Call their positions to your team it helps a lot.  Every players as a different style to attack their ennemies i'm the kinda guy to be sneaky.  You have an enormous amount of weapon possibilities in this game. You'll have to learn the time to kill of each of them. The time it takes to recuperate your bloom and so on you know where i'm going with that..  Overall with the game my experience :  I've appreciated every minutes that i've passed in this game i will never regret and will never be losing any of the good memories i had with any of you that might be reading this. No one will be forgotten for those that i loved and shared the most grateful gaming session of my first Online gaming experience. So many good memories..so many laughs..   This game is printed as a good souvenir in my memory for the rest of my life sadly haha.. ;)  Oh btw every games can get through issues but i'm glad of the efforts that the staff did to resolve them in an order of priorities because they have a list of priorities that can be more important to respect in order to stabilize the game to make it suitable.   I was glad to be a volunteer for this game as a Open Beta Tester for APB:Reloaded; APB:R Forum moderator &amp; San Paro City Tester. For the time it lasted.  I recommend this game.  Have fun and hold on might be rough as you start but with time you'll eventually get better unless it's not your priority and you're just looking for a good time.  iHope you enjoy this game as i did.   &lt;3
70	1	a	this game is awsome i love it so much,everyone should play it and please don't make it to cost money
2172	1	a	Every game has its players that take the game seriously and play to the best of their abilities. But APB takes tryharding and trolling to a whole new level. These players just do not stop the tryharding my guess is they are Counter Strike Amatuer league rejects. Trust me you will get outplayed. and trolled.
6008	0	a	this game sucks lmao

7907	0	a	horrible, i hate it honestly.
4063	0	a	well its too much of a pay to win game and i hate that
2358	1	a	Great Game 
874	1	a	 TL:DR  Good game, community bandwagon raging about random stuff that doesn't exist as big as they make it sound   So there are a lot of people screaming 'Over powered gunz' and stuff like that, it's really kinda absurd. I played this game F2P for about a year before I bought Premium and I really haven't noticed a difference other than an XP boost and a few customization increases here and there, which I don't use because art to me may as well be a trashcan.  -Yes you can buy guns, are they more powerful? By default, yes. But they have massive draw backs and are really a case by case basis, and F2P guns that you can get can be modified to be more powerful than a paid gun.   -Is the community toxic? Yeah, kinda...A lot. You find a few snowflakes here and there who are nice.  -Population has been really good recently I personally haven't noticed a difference and I'm primarily on HAN, I still see people complaining but I'm willing to blame that on people jumping on the band wagon.  -Hackers? Not really..I've seen a total of 2, in about 3 years of playing, (Yes my hours are low, I played on and off for those years and originally started off with the standard APB launcher, instead of through Steam). Yes I understand they exist, but people say it's covered in hackers which I disagree with.  -Matchmaking. One thing I hear a lot is 'Match making iz broke'...It's really not, the game finds you a match based on the most suitable players, I'd rather get my â¥â¥â¥ kicked by some R255 then waiting 50 minutes for a match, and more often than not being paired against a R255 I can still hold my own meaning I'm getting paired with people of a similar skill level to me. Personally, I've rarely noticed the match making have any issues.  (I remember it used to have major issues, but they did fix that sometime this year, I think it was)  Overall this game is fun, it's well made, bugs are minimal and are patched quite quickly, I personally really enjoy what this game has to offer, I haven't been able to find a game similar to it and really enjoy it due to that.  Yes the Engine update is like..3 years late now? But really, I'd enjoy the engine update, but the game works fine so I see no issue.  There's so many things you can do within combat alone, depending on what enviroment your in and what weapon you're using as well as what faction. For example.  I play Enforcer, commonly less than lethal, now instead of killing people it tazes them, no it's not instant and it's a pain in the â¥â¥â¥ to do but it's fine, and once tazed you may arrest the criminal, keeping them in respawn for longer. Most commonly people will go Lethal, that's your shooty bullets that kill you, yes they hurt, and weapons in that category ranges from sniper rifles to machine guns to shotguns, the diversity of weapons is great.  Then there's the massive customization options, regarding vehicles &amp; players, even death music if you're that type of person, which I won't get to into because I'm a trash designer.  Finally your clans, you can get just your friendly clans or 'pro' clans, mostly always have some form of a symbol on them and roll around in force, which makes the game a lot easier for the people in clans as you aren't getting paired with randoms, and let's face it...Randoms aren't really people you wanna be with.  This game's 'Flaws' that the community rages about are blown out of the water, most players are just bad and blame it on hacks, or 'bugs' like most games.  I just edited this for the Steam badge Â¯\_(ã)_/Â¯
1791	1	a	Played...  Died...  Spent Money...  Couldn't stop even when things got bad...  Things got better...  Became a 'somebody as one of the trailers suggests...  Spent more money...  Satisifed with the 600 dollars spent on this game and the endless customisation.
7512	0	a	Full of hackers, and the dev team is lazy as â¥â¥â¥â¥.
7271	0	a	Garbage, stay clear. 2/10 Great character creation and customization, nothing else worth mention.
1776	1	a	He was a cop, and good at his job. But then he committed the ultimate sin and testified against other cops - gone bad. Cops who tried to kill him, but got the woman he loved instead. Framed for murder, now he prowls the badlands. An outlaw hunting outlaws, a bounty hunter - an Enforcer! \nn/
10841	1	a	This game is really fun to use and play.  Small size for an amazing game aswell as it's easy to pickup and play!
2300	1	a	IDK I NEVER GOT INTO IT THATS PROBABLY A SIGN!!!! DUDUNDDDNUDNUDNDUNd
237	1	a	If you take your time and get used to the world and weapons you will do fine. Sure this game has a few hackers but so what? If you actually have some common sense and skill you can still beat them. I love this game! T ~ T
4266	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this â¥â¥â¥â¥
9089	1	a	i love this game sooooooo much!!!! best game EVER
1781	1	a	APB:Reloaded is a great game. It has one of the most massive customization abilities in F2P history. Everyone can be as unique as they so care. Not many hackers, easy to learn to play as well. The game features a fairly large car amount to have what car you would like. Same goes with clothing accessories. However, the game is mostly pay-to-win. You need to spend real money on silly things like a 30 day SMG. Or if you accually want to make a cool/complex customization creation, you need premium to do anything. And the game is good, but hard to play without the best graphics card available. It crashs about 3 hours in so this is not the game for casual players or hardcore players. The game still features great cars, good guns, a wide veriety of contacts so you can rank up and get new guns and cars as well as clothing items. After all the things i've just written, this game still gets a thumbs up, because all those pay-to-win type of things its alot of work to keep servers up and to make this a graphicly good contender to other F2P. It still needs alot of work, but as long as you stick around you will see how much the game can be, and will be improved. With 450+ hours, I approve this message.
3881	0	a	THE worse game i have played so far, you cant kill any other player....except for your teammates and enforcers who actually decide to give a â¥â¥â¥â¥ about you, i played this game and redownloaded twice due to â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ PCs and let me tell you It's â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ REASONS!: 1: your teams can choose and will probably do so: kill you for the sake of killing or to do the mission themselves 2: enforcers cant make easy money like criminals 3: aiming, shooting and killing machinics: SUCK!! 4: way too much like uberstrike with limit time using weaposn you have to buy....and re-buy....and RE-BUY 5: IT'S â¥â¥â¥â¥!   worse game ever made 0 outta 10
9376	0	a	I couldnt even get into the game after I made my acount.
7433	0	a	watch for tracking cookies on this download
2343	1	a	I love it. But not when people are 'Hacking' It just gets annoying when they kill you some how.. But other than that good game
2426	1	a	Great game &lt;3
7350	0	a	To many hackers
2323	1	a	Can you guys make it on PS3 as Play-For-Free?
4416	0	a	This game is the representation of cancer, ebola, aids, hiv and above all, pay to win. In all seriousness it has a ton of bugs, bad features, poor implementation, bad mechanics, the community is the worst and overall the experience is very, very poor. I would only recommend this game to someone who is only looking for a game where they can â¥â¥â¥â¥ around in an open world, because if you are looking for competitive gameplay this is the worst game in the history of open world free to play games. Warframe for example handles the payed features much better because they do not allow you to win over all oponents like you are a 500 pound bodybuilder fighting against tiny baby cats. Overall the game is at all points unplayable, unbalanced, and not enjoyable at all. Please do not play this until the developers decide to actually make something playable out of this so far poorly designed game. The community has been dying for a reason. Wake up you â¥â¥â¥â¥s.
3603	1	a	It's a great game but they need to improve on the guns and the missions for the cops but overall it's a great game
4136	0	a	Game itself is pretty cool its like an open world online GTA but i have to warn you.. Don't even think about playing it untill another developer manages the game since the current one is f*cking greedy as f*ck while not caring about the game itself at all.
3865	0	a	Back in 2013 I wrote a review for APB, my review consisted of me explaining that it was a good game broken but good, after this review I quit APB for a while (2 years). Recently I came back to APB because I remembered all the good times I used to have and all the fun it was. I launched it, I signed in, and I chose a district. It was good I felt all the nostalgic memories coming back to me and it felt good. Then I thought I should do a mission, I got into one and it started at this point I remember why I quit why I needed three new keyboards throughout one month and why I was such an angry gamer back then; this game just really â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sucks.The match making is bad, very bad, its real life counterpart would be a coach that coaches children to play football then there first game they go and compete in the NFL. The game is very much a pay to win, unless you feel like dedicating two years of your life to grinding levels by getting wrecked by the same players over and over again to get a gun that will change your 0.06% of a kill to a 1% of a kill, youâre going to have to pay about 100$ (but even then there is still some one that will have payed up more than you). The physics are not as bad as they could be but are still very bad. The game does not seem to think that cars, players, and other movable objects should be affected by gravity. The physics are the only thing in this game that is broken but because it is broken it is good and worth a couple laughs.   Lastly the pit of what very well could be the worst game ever created: GamersFirst. Their name is nothing but irony because that is the last thing they do, in fact there name should be MoneyFirst because it precisely what they live for. GamersFirst has owned APB for 5 years now I think, and in those 5 years what have they done?  Fix the game engine? No!  Fix matchmaking? No!  Update game engine? No! Implement a better anti-cheat? No! Fix servers? No! Add new cars and weapons? Hell yes we have tons of those, but only for people that are willing to pay! GamersFirst have not added any free or upgraded content in the entire ownership in the game but instead will add content that is only those willing to pay 300$ for a new car. In fact the game is virtually the same game as it was when they bought it if you remove all the payed features.    My recommendation for this game? Donât waste your time, instead go try a good free to play game like War Thunder, TF2, or War Frame. The worst part about it is the fact that for new players APB is quite addicting and if you start you have a good chance to sink in a good hundred to buy you that shiny new thing you want, so just donât even start. 
10368	0	a	i beta tested this game it was buggy then. i bought it played for a few weeks. quit because nothing was getting fixed. came back after it went free to play. an the same bugs an the laggy areas where still there. the only thing that changed was . they had change some of the areas too look different.
2161	1	a	APB reloaded is Very Closely related to GTA however it is far from it. The game can be fun with a team or group of friends. The team Is Highly Pay to win though. People whom Pay for Prem get Everything just about and Is/are able to have better weapons and when 2xs more money in game to get things. The biggest Issue with the game is team Balance. There is none. You get matched up with people that are WAY higher ranked then you're self and they Expect you to deal with the fact that that have Armor on and BEtter weapons that wipe you out in a heartbeat. Would I recommend the game yes but For more of a casual play on occasion sorta thing

1128	1	a	I made nazi uniforms for myself and friends, I then discoverd nazi iconography is now banned in the game. My friends and I pondered why this was so while standing on top of a burned-out car seeing who could shoot civilians at the greatest distance with the stock handgun.  I then saw a poster depicting one of the 'My Little Ponies' getting sodomized by a man, which is apparently ok to show in-game.  
6801	0	a	This is an OK game, not really worth my money (or my time), but to each his own.
5659	0	a	...
5888	0	a	I'll keep this simple. Bad graphics, gameplay, customization, and community. Mostly positive? Whoever's given this game a positive rating needs to seek professional help immediately. Avoid and go play GTA 5.
1309	1	a	Fun game and its even better playing with your clan mates and friends. The graphics arent bad but the game is not very well optimized. There are still a few hackers but FairFight does a good job at banning them. Overall great game!
4135	0	a	i give it a 4 out of 10 its not that bad its just repetitive otherwise it would be a great game
10076	1	a	Good game features, great mmo, monsterious customization and crafting system.  Lacks a more fluid combat system.
7364	0	a	ive found someone who's played nearly 3000 hours of this game  i would have killed myself
2233	1	a	A horrible example of grand theft auto. You do missions but it was all PVP. There was hardly any info on the game other than 'awesome' descriptions that don't match the actual game after 2 hours of play.  The community around the game was just as bad, nobody answering questions on the chat channels or even trying to group up. Leave it all to auto-queue and don't bother trying to make friends inside the game.
2524	1	a	i would luv this game if i didnt lag so much -_- lol
2982	1	a	Enforcer Anaiyah approves. (thumbs up) get this game. Do it. Do it now. lol right now!

5845	0	a	Doesn't work/10  I guess i should say more. well you can't smoke weed, that's not very open. oh and i love pay to win, why did i give this a thumbs down again? well to sum it up, this game is pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥in' mlg
4012	0	a	Why do people enjoy this game? What qualities of this game are attractive in any way, shape, or form? I want to know. I really do.
4004	0	a	Pay to win, no other words.
9346	1	a	I can't pinpoint why I enjoy this game so much, but enjoy it I do! The graphics are sub-par, causing me to hesitate through the tutorial as the controls were somewhat unintuitive and clunky at first. Keybindings can be changed, however I did manage to get used to the original controls within the first week or so.  The gameplay is a little repetitive, but I find most MMOs are. Gathering and crafting are both a large part of this game due to its survivalist nature, but combat is also significant in moving through the main story. Leveling is slow, but that's not necessarily a bad thing as there is substantial content in each area for you to level from.  Overall, the story line and community are both great, so if you can get past the controls and graphics on first glance, I feel like any MMO fan would enjoy this game.
4481	0	a	This game is a perfect example of what should not be made.  Broken Weapons Awful As Hell PVP  And don't even get me started on the extreme amount of pay2win  If you want to do good in this game, your going to pay for it. Literally.

It is kind of like a simple version of GTA with awesome customization and PvP. Even just driving around the city is fun. Don't spend any money if you don't like it, you don't have to in order to play.

You got gold threats trying getting into Slivers district to throw off the matchmaking and you got Slivers in Bronzes. The community is cancerous as players would call you 'noob', 'hacker', something around those lines. The lag is horrible, devs just pump more updates to take our money and don't actually do good contribution into the game. It's best you avoid this game unless you can actually handle it.
7773	0	a	i was playing a hour early and i went to get food i come back on and it sayed i was banned for no reason i did nothing to get this no hack not even â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ player off so how do i get banned for nothing and it is now one hour later gamerfirst i will not get any more of your games
2566	1	a	this is a great game!!!!
2275	1	a	I hit my friend with a car.   10/10
8434	0	a	I really like the customization,but it's too PayToWin. You can't just spend 100$ on a game.

3032	1	a	Oh god it hurts to much to play but it's a good pain UGHN END MY LIFE â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ AAAGH
3051	1	a	Funny game. Get's boring after awhile since the missions are the same. Alot of hackers once you are gold threat.
2664	1	a	very good game but only enjoyable if you play with a group of friends
6803	0	a	Pay to win with a gay playerbase
3157	1	a	APB Reloaded is (even) great(er) to play if a) you're an elite FPS b) have a top end computer.   Since I am neither I enjoyed spectating missions, getting booted and continually and unintentionally having my vehicles blow up due to poor driving.  Highly recommended.
8784	0	a	nothing but pay2win and hackers and trolls.
9052	1	a	This game is awesome. It is a great play if you're willing to put some hours into it.
164	1	a	I am torn beetween love and hate for this game. (please note I am writing this at the time the trouble maker is op) this game has some great times and laughs but prepare your wallet and also this games engine is a pile of pissy â¥â¥â¥â¥
576	1	a	Could be so much more. I still play it anyway.
5031	0	a	It's free, it's fun, and it got loads of customizations!  But sadly, the community is horrible, filled with trashtalkers and hackers.  It also get boring fast due to lack of game modes with PVP system only.  I wouldn't recommend this game lest you're the type of a gamer who's competitive or masochistic.
345	1	a	This game is really fun and keeps me wanting to come back and play after months! That's what my friend told me, I wouldn't know though because I can't run it.
6736	0	a	This game was doing for me little hope ... and I was not disapoint about uninstaller :)
5755	0	a	This game is'nt even worth trying, take it from me. Great concept, yet so many problems. 1.] Every 5 or so minutes the game kicks you. No matter what, making the game barley playable. 2.) I'ts a pay-to-win game. In reality it's not free, as you can't go halfway through teh game without paying. It's a waste of space. A waste of time. Wouldn't play it if it was the only game on earth. 0/10 go die in a hole pls.
4715	0	a	Apparently it's pay to win, although I couldn't really tell. Everyone had lots of gear, somebody shot me and I had no idea what was going on.
4130	0	a	This is a classic FTP (free to play) P2W (pay to win) which is not fair for people like me who just don't have the money to throw at a video game just to have fun (now of course I don't mean paying the initial price for a game I am reffering to spending hundreds upon hundreds of dollars just to get the upperhand on the rest of the community). Now on the contrary if you do have that kind of spare cash then this game won't be THAT bad for you, you will have access to all the customization and guns and whatnot. Overall I would give this game a 5/10 simply due to there not being GTA V for PC yet and this being the closest I know of to GTA V multiplayer.
2920	1	a	Though the game suffers from some imbalances due to bad matchmaking and the arma marketplace, it's one of the best (if not best) third person shooter mmos out there. Take the time to get used to the weapons and driving and you'll love it.  7/10
7149	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥
10483	0	a	This game involves alot of boaring walking and seems like a bad fallout 3/NV multiplayer
4458	0	a	I Didnt play this game for 2 years because of cheater but 2 years later cheaters are still at large
6401	0	a	Could be a lovely mixture of Saint Row The third with GTA (hope someone makes a better version)  Great cosept and a bit similar in how distany works, but in all Very awfull UI, not so fun driving, bad popups, more and more  postive things: - Alot of cars and guns - Alot of custom things you can add to cars and cloths  Bad things: - Most is 'locked' away behind pay bars something like nearly everything... basic guns and vehicles no... they mostly is pay for 1 free of everything else (primary, car etc) - nothing going for it in the beginning only when you have been able to unlock some its fun? - No balanced districts becomes a problem - UI sometimes can't explain whats importent and standard menu and all is messy and is not good at all (don't even tell new players where the car custominazion is or 'store' etc)
5625	0	a	You need to like them on Facebook to play. I don't have a Facebook.
8485	0	a	Great Game. One of the game that has held my attention the most. Played it for 2 years...  But, When that is said.. It has also been the most expensive game ever. And its a FreeToPlay!   The game offers a wide varity of guns, advantages, clothing and bodykits for cars = If u got the money.  I would understand if Premium was the only cost ingame. But taking money for 60% of ingame features is just wrong.  The itself is great, but the community is rude and lacks co op, The game is full of hackers, And its a Pay2Win game.   Not just Pay2Win, but Pay2Havefun...   GamerFirst really destroyed a great game.
35	1	a	This is the best worst game I've ever played. The highs are very high, and the lows are very frequent. This game is like heroin. Once you've played it for a while, it's very hard to quit.   Despire what some people are saying cheating isn't as common as they say. Having spent 3000-3500 hours playing this game, I can say that from experience. There have been more than a few closets and quite a few blatants, that's true. But it's not nearly as bad as it seems. Most of the 'cheaters' are people who've spent 1000+ hours and are in 3rd party VOIP (IE Mumble, TS, or Vent) communcating. I've been hackusated many times for things like that. As an experienced player you gain a sense of what your opponent is going to do, and if you react to what your instincs tell you, half the time you'll get a hackusation. The game also has more than a few bugs. Sometimes you'll literally see players names through a wall for no apparent reason, Or a wall will simply not load immediately letting you see through it.   While I'm not sure if I could recommend it to friends anymore, I definitely enjoy the game. The few friends I've tried to get into it have played about 20 missions and then quit because they ended up against premade teams that absolutely wreck them, over and over and over and over again.
8437	0	a	Used to be alright, now it's â¥â¥â¥â¥
8718	0	a	My grandfather was a demolitions expert in Vietnam. His wife was an O.R. nurse. Other 2 grandparents lived through the depression. All this strength in my familyline and it couldn't save me from this â¥â¥â¥â¥ing cancer of a game...  APB Reloaded is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing joke. Yes i realize i have over 600+ hours. The only reason i do is because i was dickin around with friends.  When i decided to start getting more into it. I began to realize this has got the be THE SINGLE WOOOOOORST GAAAAAAME EVVVVEEEERRR.  The devs literally are telling you to go â¥â¥â¥â¥ yourself with every possible pixel in this game. I have a list of pros and cons for APB Reloaded.   Pros:  -Unsurpassed Character Customazation -Wide range of weapons to use. -Mugging and Raiding storefronts. -Massive amount of clothes to buy (ingame money for regular clothes. cool clothes cost real money.)  Cons:  Holy mother of all that is holy, where the â¥â¥â¥â¥ do i begin... -Matchmaking is horrendous. -CASHGRABCASHGRABCASHGRABCASHGRAB -Hackers, botters, dirty cheap unskilled players who tbag even when they lose. -This community is such a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥how it makes MOBA ragers look like â¥â¥â¥â¥ing Mother Theresa. -Only 2 maps. 2 â¥â¥â¥â¥ING MAPS. This game has been out for over 6 years. -Completely lifeless dev team.  -Did i mention cashgrab? -No teamwork at all. -More hackers. -Rerolls. so...many...â¥â¥â¥â¥ing...rerolls. For those who don't know. A reroll is a person who starts up a new accoutn with prior knowledge of the game. Nothing wrong with that except for the fact the game is programmed for newly incoming players who just made an account and downloaded, to have whats called 'beginners luck'. Its programmed so that you will do well for a while and want to keep playing. People use this 'luck' and a p2w weapon to be unstoppable. -P2W. its so â¥â¥â¥â¥ing p2w its vomit worthy. Yet the asshats in this game seem to think otherwise. -Dirty players who purposfully go out of their way to farm kills and rank up off new players.  -HORRIBLE COMMUNITY OF HACKERS.  -Seriously do NOT ever play this game.  -Seriously.  0/10 Didn't proff read my longass review. It's the internet who cares?

5326	0	a	This is a purely pay to win game with an abundance of hackers and cheaters due to the ancient pre gears of war 1 engine its running on, the lack of xbox 360 controller support is sad. The engine is that porly optimised that many people complain of 'lag' due to the low en or mid range hardware that can handle other games but not this game. the game also lacks support for a modern directx or proper anti cheat, punk buster does not cut it people by pass it. in my opnion the 'engine upgrade they keep tossing around should remove the cheaters for a while untille the find new hacks and exploits. the main thing that kills the game for me is the lack of aussie servers and the extremly expensive guns on armas which are cheape for most people in europe and america who play. the thrill of kedding killed by some one with a permant op gun and premum membership + thier hacks is not a fun thing. plus the game gets repetative after a while the driving mechanics and the game physics are total rubbish. there is a desctingt lack of 3d postional audio, there are no 5.1 and 7.1 surrond sound options under audio settings this is terrible. my advice wait un till this so called engine update is relased before playing.
4875	0	a	it crashed because i was driving... thanks

3709	1	a	Im not kidding, but my computer was so bad that 20hrs were spent trying to launch it and one time when I closed it, it didnt close properly.

9879	1	a	I've had so much fun running around, picking up bits of plastic :)
5257	0	a	  I tried to like this game, but the many flaws keep holding back what COULD be a good game.  Pros:  1.) The customization is pretty good. 2.) Respectable weapon choice 3.) Interesting concept. 4.) Decent controls.  Cons: 1.) Incredibly short draw distance, which leads to players being invisible until they pop up a few feet in front of you. It makes using the many weapons the game offers incredibly worthless. 2.) Horrible community, oftentimes there are hackers, aimbots, insults and fighting in the game, and due to the friendly fire, you may end up fighting amongst the 'group' more than fighting the enemy.  3.) Zero strategy. Though most of the matches I played, the main tactic for eleminating other players came down to doing 1 of 2 things. A: get in a car and drive right up to your enemy, (since any vehicle makes the player immune to damage) hop out at the last second and 1-2 shot them with your shotgun. or B: use a 'marksman' rifle type weapon.  4.) Level imbalance. As with any RPG-ish game, you'd expect to find some advantage with being a higher level, but run into someone that has an upgraded vehicle, and you'll never be able to take them, or their vehicle out, as it soaks up grenades and sniper rounds left and right. Expect to get killed in almost every fight with someone that has any sort of upgraded gun as the basic weapons don't offer any sort of real protection against the later upgraded weapons.  5.) The game itself, tells you nothing, nor does it allow for any sort of play outside of PvP, not even a decent tutorial to familarize yourself with it's 'complex' gameplay mechanics.   I could go on, and I should, but frankly, this game is not worth wasting your time on. The few problems I mentioned above hold this game back so much, but from what the current condition of the game leads me to believe is, we'll never see any sort of patch, update, or intervention on these issues.
2191	1	a	A good free to play game, with one of the best customization options in any game, with an interesting setting, if u wish a gta mp style game, this is it.
3654	1	a	very nice game +1000 hours (before steam) very stable and their servers are the greatest! Its not laggy at all..  The matchmaking is so fair and works just fine this game is so fair and good! 10/10 Rage Quit every goddam time!

2477	1	a	Awesome Game :P
4996	0	a	Good game run by the worst company.
8963	1	a	So happy this is free-to-play now, had a lot of fun when it first released. Graphics are dated but if you can get past that its a pretty cool and unique MMO in a world of garbage clones.
4290	0	a	How can this game be on Steam? There is lag every day and the game is so unbalanced, ritteled with P2W weapons, yes, P2W. Some people claim that the weapon are situational, which is true to some extent, but overall there are a selection of weapons that picked over other weapon because they are generally superior to other weapons.   This game should be removed from Steam because it does not reach the quality that Steam should require from games. The developers are ignoring all the problems, gold servers are never used, the threat system is completely broken, gold players play on Silver districts and silver players play on Bronze districts.  The amount of players who use aimbot and triggerbot are staggeringly high. Every day you run into someone who kills an entire opposed team with secondary weapons. I don't understand why they don't change the anti-cheat system when the current one is obviously a total failure.  This is APB: server lag, weapons that are op(like ATAC, which they intentionally do not nerf, just to sell it for a while), fun as hell when there are no cheaters(car chases, fast-pased action), cheaters, griefers, stutter-lag, broken match-making, broken threat system, in-depth customization...  The cons far outweighs the pros, so remove it!
4264	0	a	People give this game a bad review for the wrong reasons. The reason this game is complete â¥â¥â¥â¥ is the fact that everyone has fixed hitbox and no mater where you hit them on their body you are going to do the same amount of damage. This means that the combat just comes down to rock paper scissors.
8670	0	a	There's a lot of reasons giving this thumbs down let me just give you some reasons before you play this.  First you'll hear kids on the mic flaming so bad, you'll see disrespectful words all over the chat people disrespecting each others every time  Joining gta V is faster than joining this game  Unfair play as you gotta pay money to get a godlike weapons and 80% of losing the missions, people playing there for years like robots killing you with a shotgun from a far distance  Glitches everywhere, you send APB support a ticket and they don't respond as i sent them a ticket a year ago how to fix my game i didn't get any reply from them  Hard to drive cars you gotta get used to them  As you're in a mission and you responding to something and finally get used to the cars people will come with a truck and ram your car to a wall and then it'll show that you suicide as they're not even your teammates or enemys to hurt you  Your teammates sometimes get butthurt and they killing you, after asking them why they trolling the game and killing me what i get is 'Because you're a really bad player learn how to play you dumbâ¥â¥â¥â¥ and you responded to the mission late so pls uninstall apb'    The game is free like there's no point going against the game and giving it thumbs down but again you gotta pay to be a godlike you gotta pay a lot of money.

267	1	a	Its a great game but please fix the lag in the game its really annoying that might help being more players in the game 
4157	0	a	What used to be an amazing game with great fun and laughter for friends and clan members has now become 'Hackers Paradise'. Gone are the days when G1 cared primarily for the customer, and now only care about the greed and how much they can make. GamerFirst, commonly now called HackersFirst and MoneyFirst are nothing more than Greed Monkeys who, if you pay lots of money to through ingame items, will allow you to freely hack on their servers until they do a massive cleanup and ban you. But alas, I recently was informed and shown an email from a clan members friend who was banned where G1 had banned him, during the cleanup, and offered to release his account if he paid a penalty and agreed not to hack again. According to the clan member, he paid the fee, updated his hacks and then carried on hacking.  The owners and operators of this game do not care about you reporting players, nor do they care about players who spend little on the game. Those who spend the most rule the game and ruin it for others. Do not play this game and do NOT spend money on it at all.
2827	1	a	Awesome game, concept's one i'm a fan of.. but if only they had a server in Australia..
7333	0	a	worst game on Steam! The game has TONS of cheaters and noobs the game isnt fair ,the cops are over-powered  gamersfirst made the Premium accounts get alot more than the f2p users this game the biggest example for the worst game and pay 2 win game.  DONT DOWNLOAD IT
7731	0	a	Aim bot hax took this gam over!
8394	0	a	I regret what i've said after a year of playing this game. It used to be good, now it's full of hackers and cheaters. Not a great game to play anymore.....
5324	0	a	POSITIVE: Honestly digged this game and was addicted like crazy. reminds me of saints row but with a faction between bountyhunters and criminals. Game itself has some really awsome customization! you can spend hrs customizing your car/clothes/guns/music/spray tags/ and more! as a criminal you can mug people and break into stores and sell them for goods. as a bounty hunter you can pretty much go cat and mouse with the crims.  NEGATIVE: now that ive said how i first felt about the game and still do a little lemme explain a little about how they need to fix the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t that actually makes you want to rage quit. first of all the tutorials SUCK! goodluck finding out how to do anything in this â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game unless you actually look it up on the internet or you have a friend on APB.   Next is the weapon and perk system. ok wtf. â¥â¥â¥â¥ing no way in hell can my character beat anyone whos been playing this game for months/years and they already have almost every damn perk in the game. and if its not the perks its the weapons. People brag constantly how much they spend actual money on the game just so they can kill you in 2-3 shots without using a sniper. oh and not to mention the HACKERS!!! its soo â¥â¥â¥â¥ing frustating!!!  i wanted to enjoy this damn game but theres no way i can play it when i either have to pay actual money to stay alive, or take constant losing for about 5 months until i can actually unlock powerful equipment! â¥â¥â¥â¥ that! There needs to be some kind of lvl measurment. oh wait! there is!   Threat level (trainee - bronze - silver - gold) which requires you to be stuck on certain servers to fit your gameplay rating. but if someone were to just constantly lose from gold and become silver and then silver to bronze or to have a group member whos bronze. then guess what. YOU ARE â¥â¥â¥â¥ED! as a trainee i fought countless golds and silvers and got my â¥â¥â¥ handed to me for days. heck weeks! and i kept getting mad at myself for not being good enough... until i finally realized it wasn't me, it was the game itself that no matter what strategy i did or used, if i wasn't properly equiped, i might as well shove my â¥â¥â¥â¥ in a blender because theres no way im â¥â¥â¥â¥ing anytime soon. lol.  CONCLUSION: I played for like about a good month until my gf and i killed eachother out of frustration, havn't played it since.  -The End

10613	1	a	It's an fun game, i've been playing it since 2012, but on the browser version. The only bad thing about the Steam version is that the gameplay screen (sumthin liek dat) is too big for me. Gameplay screen? Uhh... Screen resolution? Ehhm.. I don't know. But still, it's an good game. Steam version rating = 7 / 10 Browser version rating = 9 / 10 Total rating out of 20 = 16 / 10 Above 15 means that it's recommended, so i recommend to play this awesome game.
3954	0	a	Never have I hated a game so much but enjoy it at the same time.  This game is literally AIDs but it is so addictive and I find myself going back to it so many times.  If you enjoy lifeless worlds, horrible driving, imbalanced weapons, a cancerous 'community' and glitchy gameplay this game is a must. Otherwise, don't even bother. The character customisation isn't even worth it.
2140	1	a	It always opens to the updating screen but no progress happens. What should I do?
4840	0	a	Well there are some goods and a lot of bads. I'll start with the goods and end with an in-depth overview.  Goods: -EXTREMELY vast customization options (though limited by lack of Premuim) -Fantastic Social/'chill out' District -Very easy to use and grasp -Decent backstory -Simplistic -Potentially great teamwork  Bads: -Hello hacker city -Pay to win -Customization limited by Premium/P2W -Godawful driving (the action-reaction delay is horrific) -Very awkward controls -It's on PC instead of console -Too many kids to count -VERY CPU instensive  Overview: Basically, APB is a simplistic, visually stunning, F2P MMO very much alike Saints Row. The variety of weapons and vehicles is nice, the customization is second to none and actually tops Saints Row and any other MMO and the gameplay is addictive, racey and smooth. Though the game does have a tendency for lag spikes.  Sadly, I feel the bads outweigh the goods. The ratio of hackers/cheaters to legit players is 50/50 or MORE on the hacker side unless you play with newbies. The P2W and Premium feautures of the game are disgraceful. You will be MILES above the rest if you purchase with real money - and a LOT of it. This also sadly limits the lovely customization. The benefits and potentially essentials you get from Premuim are completely unfair and a rip-off for what they charge.  The community for the game is frankly disgusting, too. Primarily due to it's fanbase being kids, low-esteemed 'girlgamers' and social-networking rejects. Expect to be called a noob and whined at in a moments notice and don't be suprised if the chat seems like it's been taken over by an army of 14yr old scene kids and CoDfans. The marketplace is lacking within this too. I would say that 'Gold Threat' players are far worse than any whiney tryhard in a CoD hacker lobby. Avoid them at all costs.  Verdict: Unless you're wealthy and willing to spend a good $120 on this 'F2P' game, willing to play with the newbies (which isn't bad at all), speak Russian, want a social MMO or have a bunch of clan-mates to play with, I would not waste time and memory with this game. It is extremely CPU intensive and addictive. Otherwise, gold-threats avoided, this is rather fun.
136	1	a	APB Reloaded is pure competative PvP, if you don't like playing or is terrible at PvP and FPS, you will hate this game. This is a Free to Play game, that is also Pay to Win. Try this game and see if you like it.  I tried APB for a few hours over the years ( I actually also played this game some in beta before it was free2play) and realized it would not be a good game for just anyone.   It was sort of fun being a criminal, but as a cop, it is harder. You have a car driving game through the city streets filled with cars, people, sidewalk objects, all things that you can hit or miss depending on your driving skills.   The combat part is where it is unenjoyable, your success depends on your weapons, shooting skill and teamwork skills, but it seems all the players you meet in the game are better than you and have better weapons, or they have godlike shooting skills by hacking while using the best weapons. The combat part is unavoidable part of questing to level up and unlock new gear.   The veteran player community does not like noobs on their team, if u look like a noob, they kick you off team or leave team. If you are pugging with other noobs, you will lose most challenges. And the matchmaking is crap still.  The fashion creation part is sort of ok except you have to level up to unlock fashion parts too.  If you have real money to throw at this game then you can buy the best gear and look good playing.   The devs lately have added a new hacker protection system that might help stop hacking. Not sure if the Hacker protection system is working or just falsely banning people.   Play this free game at your own risk. Don't pay real money for this game.

9576	0	a	Actually this game is not in steam at all... you have to create a gamersfirst account and the updater trends to hijack your connection while updating, if you really like to play this don't download it here, go directly to gamersfirst and download the client manually
6572	0	a	This game is GREAT but ALOT of HACKERS
4689	0	a	This game is awful, its full of cheaters and it lags terribly. Plus the Devs are pieces of â¥â¥â¥â¥ and its a p2w, so if you enjoy â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ games, cheaters, and having to pay for anything good in the game then you will love it. I wouldnt reccommend this game to anybody, literally anybody, not even my worst enemy.
5210	0	a	Good game but filled with cheaters and poor optimization. Don't play this game unless you got lots of money to spend...
6510	0	a	Couldn't even get it to load up :/ kept crashing and I have a amazing computer...... so I hope this works for someone and they can tell me if it's good
5196	0	a	THIS GAME IS â¥â¥â¥â¥ I REPEATED THE SAME THING 5 TIMES IN A ROW HAD TO DOWNLOAD 4GB WORTH OF UPDATES PLEASE FIX. AND BY THE WAY YOUR GAME IS â¥â¥â¥â¥ 
5071	0	a	I come from an unwealthy family and I broke my LCD monitor because of toxic kids in this game that used pay to win weapons. I loved the game for the customisation but it â¥â¥â¥â¥ing sucks donkey â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS GAME â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ OATJAOWJTWA  Edit: I actually have far more than the 23 hours on steam, I have around 400 hours in this game
3824	0	a	This Game is the epitome of a â¥â¥â¥â¥ game. The redeeming qualitites of this game are few and far between, Playing with your friends on this game can be fun but other than that the gunplay is horrible, You can hide in a vehicle because vehicles have a health bar instead of a damage model and then jump out like a little â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ when your enemy is reloading, This causes people to use tactics that take advantage of obvious flaws in the game like using overpowered guns. This game is just pure â¥â¥â¥â¥ unless played with friends , then it is â¥â¥â¥â¥ with sprinkles ontop
10693	1	a	This game has gone through VERY BIG rough patches with Kabam. However DECA games brings hope to ROTMG to show this game's full potential. Very excited to see what happens.
4944	0	a	would be amazing if they fixed it.... great game, i bought it twice at first, thats like 40$ before it came to steam
280	1	a	APB Reloaded IS A GRAET GAME
8758	0	a	this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ 
5484	0	a	Bad Graphics You Can't Even Drive A Car Normaly
6344	0	a	I hate this game. Random nonsense.
7652	0	a	This game is broken and it's getting more broke with every update. Admins ban anyone they want no matter what they did. The lag is apsolutely amazing. If you get frustrated very easily DON'T GET THIS GAME. On the other hand the game is very original and if it wasn't in the uncapable hands of gaymers first maybe it would have been an awesome game!
4446	0	a	Absolutely the worst game I have ever played in my whole entire existence.
6219	0	a	3 words, pay to win
10159	1	a	Great MMO,but graphics are kinda crappy
6007	0	a	I enjoyed the look of this game, I engoyed the feel of this game. But it's marketplace is got to be the worst part of the game. I bought some clothes with in-game currency, bought ammo with in-game currency, but you have to buy weapons with real money? This is possible the best example of Pay-2-Win. Everything that does nothing but improve look is free but everything that improves combat effectiveness is must be payed for.
3514	1	a	all i do is steal cars and crash them into walls.. 10/10 would drive off bridge again
8150	0	a	Why wont the game load for me?
8652	0	a	This game was fun for a while, but quickly got boring. Along with that you've got the most cringe-worthy and toxic of communities, and you just end up with a hot mess that likes to charge you 40-bucks for Pay to Win guns, and overall it's just not worth the effort.  This was a game we all looked forward to and drooled over... but in the end it didn't live up to what it could have potentially offered. And honestly I think a lot of that had to do with gamersfirst being in charge of it. Quit a slimey company, especially if you read any of their official responses on their forums.
1742	1	a	Haters going to hate, people who gives this game a thumbs down have played this game for 1000hours and more lol. Game is fun, but many problems.
6203	0	a	Great game idea, bad base players all out for themselves, devs are just wanting money shame could of been a great game and a bigger success if it was put on the right course.
2578	1	a	Awesome Game Great Free To Play
10829	1	a	evey one get this game its really adictve
9253	0	a	The games graphix are some what decent , the community a bunch of douches lvling no fun at all and is a pvp based game and the moderators complete imbosiles ... exept for that great game ... o wait thats most of it ... ... o and ALOT of people hack the hell out of that game to ..
10847	1	a	This Game is Awesome, get it or you will die by my hands
4323	0	a	The customization on this game is really good i must admit for quite an old game.  Pretty fun at start rekting people. Occasionally you get them hackers... not fun.  However, I really Hate the weapons that have this 30 day buy deal or Permenant deal for a certain price which then gets expired. It REALLY â¥â¥â¥â¥in sucks and not a great system imo. It also sucks how you buy a perk in the game; For example, the Car Sufer mod, when i bought it with earned money inside the game i was so excited and I thought it was permenant? But nope. It wasn't. It really sucked.. Quit after that happened.  You play deathmatch and people have Rocket Launchers = instant death. Not fun. This game has died out many years ago. Wish they didn't sell it to this new company.. But heyho.. it happens. Buisness is Buisness.  In the end, I played this game since the beta and just recently got back into it. I have 85.8hrs in total and I would recommend this game if you have friends its really fun. But soloing is pretty boring after a while.  Other than that I dont think this game is worth playing anymore. It has had it's chance and it failed.
6614	0	a	This game is being slamed (mainly because of it being a bad remake), but could still be fixed if was done well. First off, this game has the option to make your own charater, clothes, music, cars, and clans... But it mainly makes you work for these items by making you grind missions or paying money. This game also lets you use weapons and steal cars, but it's as fun as it's intended... See where I'm getting at.  Also the game gets buggy with good or bad connection (even with the graphics on low), it's like you need a supercomputer to use it (just like summer wars).  I will give it a 6/10, but though I don't reccomend it, I am sure someone is going to play it because I said so... Go enjoy the rocks you use as soap, because thats how dumb you are to play this... I am still gonna play it though (to make it better of course).
1122	1	a	hours of fun customizing cars and outfits aswell as lots of fun killing and driving through the streets running over pedrestrians
584	1	a	I don't know why, but i really recommend this game. Good soundtrack, pretty nice graphics, cool gameplay. Just play it! No matter if these â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s that pay by 'Microtransactions' are rekting ya. Just have fun! &lt;3
5330	0	a	Could not load it...I do like it but just could not play it.
5365	0	a	Just get any Saints row or GTA game, its better then APB in everyway, don't get me started on the hit detection.
730	1	a	Ok dispite of the reviews i went ahead and dowloaded this game.... It is soooo much fun probally increibly boring without freinds i always played with freinds and it was so much fun the car meachnics are great the cutomisation is great the gunplay is great the missons are ok not bad but ok and it runs pretty smooth considering i only have a gt 630 graphics card an i6 prosesser and 4 gigs of ram :D
714	1	a	Was good for me, but they have to fix the people you get matched against... I don't like getting â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥.
10304	1	a	fallen earth is an impressive game as the graphics are aesthetically pleasing and the amount of in game items (trinkets weapons armor etc.) is immense. however the game is hindered by having very few non-pvp areas.
6469	0	a	My steam profile keeps saying i'm in game APB reloaded but i'm not so lets get to the point THE GAME IS RUBBISH CRAP
3639	1	a	It's fun.
1912	1	a	I dont know why everyone is so mad. I mean, there are a lot of people that hack, a lot of things you can buy for real money, BUT the game is still really fun. (If you can, bring a friend, it only makes the game very much better)
10791	1	a	Its art style is unique,and the gameplay is entertaining yet challenging enough. Definitly a great game to grab!
10390	0	a	- Development start date: 2006 Reloaded Studios. - Original release date: September 22, 2009 by Icarus Studios/Reloaded Studios. - Acquired by GamersFirst/Reloaded Studios June 15, 2011.  Pros: - Neat vehicles and pretty decent game mechanics.  Cons: - Content updates minimal since its release (patches somewhat regular but mostly just tweaks). - Outside game wiki nearly mandatory to make any progress.  I spent 2 months as a premium member for bonuses to crafting and leveling. But unfortunately I felt that decent game mechanics where hindered by incomplete or sparse content. Overall the game seemed very empty and bare boned. Monsters, weapons and gear felt repetitive and minimal. The original development team left many unfulfilled promises before abandoning this game to 'GamersFirst'. Last I played, a small community of players were still around and a GM or 2 were somewhat active.  As a fan of the post-apocalyptic theme and MMOs this game was a giant tease that left me wishing for more content and optimization. Stuff that simply never came.
9031	1	a	After playing this game for 1000+ hours I can finally make a statement.  Pros: - made lots of friends, - had fun for a few weeks,  Cons: - outdated graphics, - juvenile and trolling player base, - balanced PvP? BAH! Forget PvP if you use rifles or pistols. - late game is definietly a money sink. If you don't pay, forget about the Alpha zone or later areas.  Still recommend it as a friend finding application :).  Edit: You can craft grilled prairie chicken. 11/10
907	1	a	F*ckin' nice game!
8335	0	a	This game has one of the best player and outfit creating tools in any game. And its a shame really because thats the only good thing about this game. First of all and biggest complaints is people using hacks. I would say about 35% of players are actively using hacks such as aimbots. Sure some get banned but in a free to play game were a cheater simply has to make a new account and is back into the game aimboting away. I have spent many hours in this game and I can say the only enjoyment i get is making cool designs and hanging out in the social district. Actually playing this game is a big no no with all the aimbots. Stack all that with the most wallet gougeing pay to win model you can think of and you have APB  1/10 and it would be a zero if not for the amazing ability to customize characters. but they found a way to make you have to pay for that as well
7472	0	a	When I saw the trailers, I thought that this is going to be epic game. But the truth is, that it is not. It has some good features, like breaking into a store throught the shop window with a car or the possibility of editing your character's appearance. But to be honest, you can't stand a chance in most of the PVP actions, since there are always players with special items from the store, that you can buy for real money.   So for me, it's a NO, when someone asks me about the game.
7561	0	a	game started to crash after first launc (
1584	1	a	only if there was a medieval game like this
4736	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥T that what it is. this game is just like warface looks awesome in trailors but when it comes to game play u need micro-transaction (visa-maestro) for almost everything u got to shop for guns/clothes BOOOM! they ask you money u want to spawn in a car BOOOM! money $$$$$$$$$$$$$$ everywhere without a good â¥â¥â¥â¥ u will get_r3kt like a NOOOB
1922	1	a	Other than the fact that Gold Rated Districts and Players are either hackers or gods, â¥â¥â¥â¥ing awesome game with intense ammounts of creative freedom, also get ready for the pervs, there are lots.
8864	0	a	I played this game early on, ran a very popular clan, and loved PVP. Gamersfirst destroyed Fallenearth. In 3 years, they have made 4 new weapons. No new levels, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ exspansion areas. This was one of the best games I ever played, but G1, destroyed the whole game. Don't let my hours through steam fool you, I played way before steam launch. The PvP used the be the best I could find anywhere, but now it is so plagued with aim botters, and all the PvP builds are cookie cutter builds. I made a build from my own preference, a low heals high damage fighter, and it worked, so what happens, they nerfed it till I couldn't use it anymore. Building a character for PvP through your rp mindset doesn't work. The PvP is down to a variety of six weapons, and four reskinned sets of armor. The developers of this game, take all the money from it, and dump it into other games. It was one of the best MMOs I ever played, and it will not be forgotten, but as it stands I will never play again .
10516	0	a	I played this game when it was a browser game back in the days and damn what a good game. Thanks Kabam.
7944	0	a	lulz this game was good, and only fun to the hackers
3416	1	a	Best copV.sRobber game ever
8160	0	a	the video hyped it up and in game it was a let down
4723	0	a	garbage cant get passed terms and conditions
9989	0	a	THIS GAME SUCKS...I CANNOT LOG IN!!  THEN IM SO ANGRY ABOUT THIS
8779	0	a	game isnt actually free to play
7710	0	a	Not that great.
4880	0	a	The game is so buggy it says i am playin APB but i dont play it :( plz fix it
28	1	a	The relaunch of APB was proper, given the potential of the game, and the new free-to-play format is well suited to the characteristics of this discrete action game-style sandbox. The addition of new locations and the optimization of certain mechanics have certainly had the merit of making the experience more pleasant and multifaceted, and we must add that the outlay of real cash is absolutely not a requirement, especially not at the beginning They have high expectations and want to evaluate the product well. However a number of shortcomings is not insignificant relative to the controls, the feeling of weapons and, not least, the quality of the matchmaking and connection in general. It will therefore be interesting to see how and what APB Reloaded will be improved between now and a few months. As new beginning however, it is moderately encouraging.
3421	1	a	A game of 'cops and robbers.' While the robber's have it easy, they can earn money by robbing, and cop 'must' earn money by 'taking' a robber's 'stolen' money and by missions. The game can provide entertianment, but does tend to get 'old' after a while.  -dark  *This is my review but the best way to find out if you like it is to play it.
7041	0	a	To much error's.
2576	1	a	Great game. If you like Grand Theft Auto, you'll love this. Very great character customization, car customization, and it's just an all-around fun game.
2785	1	a	One of the best 3rd person shooters I've ever played, lots of fun in a massive city!
3203	1	a	I get in game do a mission and get rekt by kits that paid for guns that are better using their moms credit card. 10/10 would get rekt again
5713	0	a	Wanted to come back when saw announcment about new anti-cheat system. In first missions people followed my movement trough the walls, throw grenades at any of my cover spots, and vip instead of hiding was standing in the middle of the streets and killing all incoming enemies with pistol only. From any distance.  You are not a cheater? Forget about this game.
9621	1	a	Never played game, writes review. 10/10 wouldent play again?
8759	0	a	It was good,it's bad now.
10143	1	a	Have barely dented this game but so far it is pretty fun, contrary to other reviews the community is actual super friendly and helpful. Also contrary to other reviews Fallout fans will definitely enjoy this game, as long as you're not one of those close-minded gamers who compares every detail of a game to other triple A titles in the genre, yes it does give you a Fallout experience though it's not trying to be Fallout. It is it's own game. Kinda hard to get the hang of at first but if you are a vigilant gamer like myself you'll figure it out. Final note on that matter, there is a help channel in chat that you can ask anything on and every Vet and their mother that has figured the game out will give you better tips and advice than the wiki itself can. As far as mmorpgs go I'd give it an 8.5/10 mostly due to the unique immersive experience.
856	1	a	As many people have already said, the game is pretty much P2W, but ignoring that fact the game is great. The characters and vehicles are more customisable than a Subway sandwich, and if you grab 2 or 3 friends the game is infinitely better and more fun. Granted, some people may have trouble running the game for issues that they blame on the game, and hell the issues might actually be because of the game, but if you can run the game smoothly, you have some friends to play with, and you encounter few P2Ws then the game will be great. Sometimes you have to ignore the cons and focus on how awesome the pros are to properly enjoy a game.
2582	1	a	Great game. But at times it feels like pay to play as there are some OP players out there with payed equipment though with good enough skill you can win. And the game support is actually quite good.

3057	1	a	i dont care about the rating or other reviews. this game is what i'd call the second gta 5 online. its great and its for the computer which i'd call a cool game so argue all u want about this i still say this needs more people
10188	0	a	this game is so bad i cant stand how slow the game is its just bad 0/10
3550	1	a	Very fun game, sometimes the premiums and hackers can be asses, but all in all it's a recommendable game for friends to play ^^
4612	0	a	Falsely banned over 3 years ago. Terrible customer service as you can't even email them to contest the ban. Didn't respond to my BBB inquiry.   Had the nerve to tell me that I was justly banned but the need my money now so they are unbanning me. They can shove this game where the sun doesn't shine.
3339	1	a	This game is â¥â¥â¥â¥. Sprayed nazi propaganda on a massive wall.   Go download this â¥â¥â¥â¥ing thing
4489	0	a	ERROR simulator 2015.  created character - ERROR  trying to enter the game - ERROR  when you FINALLY entered the game somehow - you get kicked for NOTHING  when you log-in - ERROR - someone else is using your account  F*ck this game!
8707	0	a	This game sucks, it is nothing the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing trailers, all you do is go into a mission which has several objectives in it. everyone kills everyone no matter the team. I can't believe I wasted 1.7 hours of my life on this. I'am deleting it off my computer until they fix this laggy â¥â¥â¥ piece of trash game.
8385	0	a	nerf Mommy's credit card please
173	1	a	'Fresh and New' free to play.  With a lot of free to play titles, people complain. Concidering that the title is free, I don't understand that.  Anyways, out of the limited time I played, it takes a longer then normal time to understand things. The tiny yet steap learning curve might make you uninstall it out of rage. Beyond that, APB is a reasonable F2P game.  Graphics can be scaled, and durring my time, AA was in beta (how, I do not know). Nothing to blow you out of the water, but solid attempt at reasonable graphics in a free title.  Would I give this a thumbs down? No way. Would it be a 'must play'? No. Is it horrible? No.   You have nothing to gain or loose by wasting a few hours on this -- or by not installing and playing.  6.5/10
4269	0	a	This game is fun and all, it's just that there's so much that could be fixed. There's way too many hackers in this game and the developer's just made an automatic ban system to ban the hacks that are known to the system.   Also let's say that you've played 6 missions in a row, won them all, great stats &amp; all that. Your next mission can cause you to quit the game entirely because of bullsh!t game mechanics killing you, enemy team teaming up and playing the game way too competitive or just get tickled to death by a nano or whatever.   I've had so much fun in this game but now it's just like tip of a pen that's running out of ink. No more ink = No more fun.  I wouldn't recommend this game to any of my friends unless they've played it and can handle or have experienced utter sh!t mechanics f*cking you over and over again.  If there wasn't any customization in this game i would've never spent all the hours that i have now.
8031	0	a	This game (to me) is horrible, I can't even load into the game as it f'ing sends me to a page to like their facebook page 
7645	0	a	the game:  [cons] very rare updates, except when there is new cash shop items, which is really often. the frequency of new cashshop weapons shows the game weapon balance is .. lets say .. from non existant to â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up. repetitive, will get to know all of the game has to offer in under 1 hour.  [pros] One of the better player, clothing, vehicle costomization you can find. In game editor somewhat effecitve.  The gameplay:  [cons] pay to win, With a cashshop item, learn curve is non existant. repetitive 'missions' it pretty much boils down to a team death match in a different location on the map every time. Horrendous level design. Uber effective choke points renders knowing the map aka time spent in game, more important than your ability to land shots. voip is a must, require real life friends to play with you. no headshots, less lucky kills. less dynamics. steep and stable learning curve.   [pros] you get to drive cars. shoot guns wear fancy DIY textured clothings via in game editior 
809	1	a	There is better ways to hurt yourself than playing this game.
9966	0	a	you can not log in
47	1	a	How To Play: 1). Start Game  2). Spend 3-10 hours creating character 3). Try to play but gives error 4). Rate the game 10/10 GOTY IGN GAME JOLT 
5810	0	a	for a free game... sure   but the micro transations are where it reeeeeeaaally gets fun!
3324	1	a	oh hi  nice game   i have 60R in this game :D
3333	1	a	Fix your game, i am stuck on the character menu.
2573	1	a	Great game if you can put up with the lag and occasional bull poop moment... has improved slightly over the years but they wont fix the servers for some reason...
6767	0	a	WOULD YOU LIKE TO BUY A PISTOL FOR 99 CENTS IN REAL MONEY? 
2739	1	a	Its free you can steal cars and shoot people!
5658	0	a	This game... If its not the unbalanced matchmaking that gets u annoyed in this game its the hackers or the 12 year old children who use their moms credit card to buy a bazooka and the fastest car in the game to make other peoples gameplay a living hell. Game has a great concept but thats as far as it gets. Developers are just too greedy trying to satisfy their own needs than actually balancing â¥â¥â¥â¥ in this game.
8420	0	a	The game is good, but it is buy to win so â¥â¥â¥â¥ it...
9163	0	a	hi i tried this out and... yeah game isnt that good i tried it out the opening is WTF? story meh.... wait if eleena said i cant regenarate anymore then how the hell when i died i got back to life? and gameplay is OK its just like fallout but with bad story line worse gameplay unrealstic futurstic â¥â¥â¥â¥ game 3/10 seen better
6911	0	a	its like gta but this game is awful
1854	1	a	Great game to play and have fun with friends. Downsides I think are really BIG problems: take ages to get characters looking good, get weapons that are awesome and to get good vehicles. Plus if you don't play for ages then suddenly come back on things usually go missing from your account; like vehicles or clothing. But all in all, a really fun game.
143	1	a	its fun if you have friends to play with, but can be frustrating when the other team is 4 max rank golds tryhards on TS3 versus you and your friends or some ramdom casuals.
1959	1	a	for those who are fans of playing TPS-type games, or you're just looking for something new....this game right here? totally worth it.
5395	0	a	Like GTA, except really really â¥â¥â¥â¥
3291	1	a	This is an really awesome game played over 250 hours with my main account !
10084	0	a	Probably the worst Post Apocalyptic Survival i have played. So much lag, graphics are completely terrible, i noticed a lot of hacking as well along with overpowered enemies and you have to put tons of money into the game to be able to get anything good. As of all the game is not worth it, it is a waste of time and space.  2/10 i would say to be honest, The game has achieved to be on steam and has gotten many players to play it. But everything is off on it completely. And also to add the website is off 80% of the time and so is the main server. (I have played for a whole day\24 hours and it still sucks â¥â¥â¥...)
8059	0	a	They are rapidly destroying the game, patch by patch.They quickly turning this into a CoD replica, and a horrible one at that.
7216	0	a	This game is CRAP seriously i wasted 1090 hours on bull â¥â¥â¥â¥ the missons are the same , people are actually hacking , fairfight banning random people for being good and PAY TO FU=KING WIN is bull â¥â¥â¥â¥ its more like pay to lose and get banned
7883	0	a	It's fun, but it never got the finish it needed to be a truly great game. At this point, I would say wait for GTA V for PC. It's got similar gameplay, but GTA V is just much better in every conceivable way.
7286	0	a	it messed up my steam pretty bad it constantly says im playing the game so dont play if your impatiant with loading and constantly quit games during loading
1306	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this gay game it would not let me play i could not chose a world
1409	1	a	This game is So awsome i really recommend playing this if u love cops and robbers, teamdeath match games
7233	0	a	It's been trying to launch for 40 minutes now and I'm still looking at my desktop background
4615	0	a	Nice idea totally broken by a horrible matchmaking, which ends making matches between fresh new players that are learning how to play with endgame players (makes totally no sense). Also, as usual in every 'Free To Play Games' theres a 'Pay To Win Option' that makes you premium and get the good weapons to win all matches easily.  Most weapons AREN'T permanent, they last around 10 days max. The game constantly lag's out, and bugs are frequent. Specially when you're shooting.  The protection against hackers is horrible, as I have seen people using Pistols from long range like if they were using a sniper (reminding that theres not a zoom option, or a very very poor one), I've also seen people using Heavy Rifles with the accuracy of a sniper, which is highly improbable.  Do not recommend, waste your time elsewhere :)    
7284	0	a	Cool game with interesting ideas held back by lag and hackers. Decided to log on after a couple of years to see if things have improved. Chat full of complaints of lag as everything stops to be followed by everyone immediately driving into a wall. Dealt with it awhile to give it a chance because there is a lot of really cool stuff in this game. I finally got into a mission and was immediately killed by a player jumping and spinning snapping to and dropping anyone within line of site. Immediately uninstalled. Would be a worthwhile game if you didn't have to deal with P2WIN, LAG, and HACKERS.
533	1	a	such a good game can customize a lot of stuff, the graphics are pretty good, i like the gameplay of it,
1614	1	a	Played it, died over 50 times. 9/11
8990	1	a	This game is literally unplayable.
10739	1	a	You think stepping on a Lego is painful; try dying with a level 19 character.
3367	1	a	It's basically a poor man's GTA Online. The character creator is suprisingly in-depth for some reason. I can't speak for whether it's pay-to-win or not as I never actually bothered looking at the cash shop.
1570	1	a	its good or something
5800	0	a	After waiting for the game to download. I had to wait for another download which last around an hour every time i've tried to play. I havnt even been aple to play it yet, and i know its â¥â¥â¥â¥. DO NOT GET IT!!!
9531	1	a	A truly ambitious recreation of the Fallout series in MMO format minus any talent whatsoever.
3012	1	a	I've played first version of APB( with subscription like for one month or so) and it was poorer than this. Wow! Awesome FPS with open map. It's like GTA but smaller. I like whole 'in game'system and shoping. This game has only one defect - frustration when someone kills you! ahh
9000	1	a	A cold apocolypse MMORPG/MMOFPS/MMOTPS Story line is a bit weak and not much refered to it, but that doesn't matter. A lot of weaponry/armor/... Also RolePlay! Give it a shot ;) it's free anyway :)
7092	0	a	does not load not worth the download
2075	1	a	Rated A for A-holes.
9204	1	a	Free and great ,what do u want more ? :D

6143	0	a	Most Pay2Win game I've played.
8435	0	a	this game is just a game, not intersting game, just a game.. not a good game. just a game.. just a game..  there are better games, this game is just a game
1836	1	a	WTF happed? 
10406	1	a	p2w much, but overall a fun game, especially if you join a guild lots of farming, pvp, 7\10
9098	1	a	WHY ARE U READING THIS GET THE GAME ALREADY ITS FUN
8881	1	a	With a story that was developed with obvious care, to the extent that character-respawning is one of the largest facets of the game, you can tell that this game had it's heart in the right place. This may seem like nonsense to you, but a lot of games out there these days simply tack on the story to the rest of the game, rather than the other way around (as it should).  With a game like Fallen Earth, you can tell that the story came first, and everything else was built around there; from the architecture, weapons, vehicles, and equipment, it all makes sense within the setting. With the way the game's story is, there isn't the problem of 'when everyone in an MMO is the chosen character, no one is', and the characters within the game treat you as a person and not The Big Cool Hero. Extremely refreshing.  If that doesn't say anything, let me tell you something about my hours in this game (on the other version of Fallen Earth, as there are two in Steam, as for a little while FE wasn't on Steam): I have over 2000 hours in the game, a feat surpassed only by my GMOD hours.
8352	0	a	couldn't even get it to work had to restart pc to close it dont download
318	1	a	this game rocks
5562	0	a	Ruined game
1815	1	a	Propanity. 10/10
2790	1	a	very underestimated, its really good i like the creativity involed in the game and you should definatly download this. people say this game has hackers and bad performance, i have encountered no hackers and have smooth fps, but what do you expect its a huge game its not going to run 60fps with no problem.  11/10 - ITS FREE!
2968	1	a	Best game ever exept u have to add that u can destroy the windows from cars so put that in the next update
4905	0	a	Might be fun sometimes but seriously, this game is just p2w (by the joker box weps) You will laugh at me of my time but im not on my main acc now, lol!
5452	0	a	APB in all is a very fun game but on bronze and silver servers there are always gold players and it ends up being difficult to play. also they are a very high number of hackers on this game
5168	0	a	WORST COMPANY EVER..... the game was great but not anymore.
2037	1	a	Not good as gta but its fun.
6416	0	a	This is just another 'Pay-to-win' game that is advertised as 'Free-to-play.' Sure, all you have to do is download and play, but you have to stick with crappy items unless you pay. It isn't the worst game, but it certainly is not great.
589	1	a	Great and fun Open World game
2063	1	a	its ok
6245	0	a	It's a pay to win game, or with extreme skill or hacks you will be able to live through a whole mission without dying.  3,5 out of 10 would bang if i was forced to.
1215	1	a	AWESOME JUST LIKE GTA
6501	0	a	free 2 play my â¥â¥â¥
10208	1	a	highly recommend if you like the fallout series mainly new vegas and fallout 3 this game is a little bit different though because theres a big emphasis on crafting and there are mounts and its multiplayer but kindof the same setting as fallout with the whole desert waistland and mutated creatures and factions
3397	1	a	Tons of fun for a F2P game, the more friends you play with the better. Only drawbacks are the slightly awkward UI for shops and the time limit on weapons and Vehicles which you purchase but that is a downfall of the sales model.
1117	1	a	Like GTA, customizing,Cars,ETC this Game is for you It's like GTA But better Get this game it's free!
8535	0	a	Crashes to much as soon as I get in game  
10711	0	a	Bloody overrated piece of crap
5718	0	a	Long loading screens, many time wasters, worst game ever. I deserve some hash browns.
7125	0	a	Wellfare GTA 5 Online.  With somehow even more hackers.
2991	1	a	Awseme... Gud Grophix!!! Adn amezang gayme
2267	1	a	Everything that's good about this game is also bad about it. Gameplay is very fun and simple, yet incredibly repetitive and plain; the level and weapon system is complex enough to give the player incentive to progress and its not p2w either, but at some point you're gonna understand that there's only 5 different missions in the game and you're doing the same sh*t over and over. Customization is one of the best out there, but guess what, you have to pay real $$$ to get the cool clothing items and customization slots.   At the end of the day though, there's no real reason not to try it. It is fun to play with friends, it is very competitive yet easy, and it also happens to be free to play.
275	1	a	Really Great Game because it has all things you need to do for example, Missions,Groups, etc
3231	1	a	this is a fun action pack game it is hands down the best PvP game i have played on Steam.
7952	0	a	Its beyond boring. no point to it. i tried to play it a billion times and i hated it every time. not worth the free download and space. â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game.
9775	0	a	it is impossible to make an account. unplayable, unbeliveable
7203	0	a	pros: My character looks like Arnold schwarzenegger cons: Everything else!
1598	1	a	:)
5206	0	a	its a bad game to play for people who like gta style type gaming because the game itself isn't realistic and gun aren't good too 
5318	0	a	U need money to have fun = APB Reloaded
4887	0	a	i can play this game 
6418	0	a	One of the most unbalanced games I have ever seen. It is free to play but not free to enjoy. It's pay to enjoy. The 'joker' rifle that you can pay like $3 a month to rent is one of the most OP guns I have ever seen in a game. It kills you in only a few bullets and a lot of people use it, making any and all f2p guns that you can unlock completely useless. Why don't I quit crying and get it then? Because it still means that I will not be challenged by anyone on the other team unless they also have this weapon. It is just not any fun killing/getting killed by two bullets. Trust me it is just not cool. The other massive flaw is the location of missions. They are put in a way that whichever team gets there first can win by simply camping the area because there are just not any ways in that will not see you getting mowed down no matter what. It is some of the worst mission level design I have ever seen.
1437	1	a	APB Is a game with endless thought of makeing cars, people ect. The only thing crappy about the game is the lag i cant stand lag but i get used to it everthing else is perfect! 11/10
178	1	a	I am R130 ENF and R70 CRIM, this game is pretty enjoyable for me because of the sheer customization. The reason I have stopped playing is because of CS:GO (Nothing to do with APB: Reloaded itself). There are so many interesting things you can do on this game, for example spamming WASD to run in a circle and evade bullets like Neo from the Matrix! Or using LTL (Less than Lethal) Grenade launchers to stun everyone for days! There are quite a few cars, and in all honesty, there is no point in playing this game whatsoever without a premium sub. If you're not an Artist like me, than don't fret, you can still find music and cars designed by others for a fee. It may be difficult for you to place yourself in this game, or to have fun if you do not have friends who PC game, but don't worry! There are many clans and groups that play that aren't hacking, and some of them are really friendly. :D  Anyways, this games Guns (and many other items) are timed, which isn't really a problem TBH (I did eventually buy permanent weapons over a span of 3 years), and you definitely feel the prestige of getting higher and higher level. My brother plays this as well, all he does is create music to sell. It's worked out very well for him, he can buy anything on the game he wants aside from Joker content.  All in all, I recommend playing this game at least long enough to get to R100, hopefully you'll have a good time and enjoy the game to it's fullest by then. :)
10493	1	a	Ive played this years ago when it first came out. I was kind of unimpressed with the beginning area where you have to fight your way outside, but once in the outer region, it was very neat.. Lots of quests to do, crafting is good, the economy in game was good.. ie putting things on the broker, and I did the questline where you can craft a atv i think it was and then motorbikes and cars. This game is definatly worth playing, altho like I said the first 10 minutes of it will make you wonder. Just hang in there ! I'm going to do a reinstall, myself.
5223	0	a	I have spent countless hours on this game wasting a little over a thousand dollars on it (I'm crying) and everything was great until Fairfight was introduced now this isn't the same Fairfight from battlefield, this is the $5 version of Fairfight, basically what it does is it bans you from hack reports and your K/D ratio so if you do good your going to get reported for 'hacking' and you will get banned.. that's what happpened to me now for the sake of your life don't play this game!
5638	0	a	Game is awful. Driving I discovered is awful and I only played for 10 minutes before finding it awful.
1970	1	a	Really good game that you can solo or play with a buddy.Pretty detailed and will keep you shooting for days. Best played with a friend
4402	0	a	You pretty much just get tossed into this game with absolutely no clue what you're expected to do and somewhere between few and no tutorials to explain how to do it. After fumbling around my first five minutes, I eventually picked up a quest to go capture some criminal....on the other side of the city. With no car to drive to him.   Ten minutes of running later, I realize this guy is moving. Five minutes later I realize it's another PC i'm chasing. 5 seconds later i'm dead, and I respawn halfway across the city from my target.   I was done at that point.
2699	1	a	its the best better than tf2
7274	0	a	Let me tell you exactly what happens when you start playing this game: 'Oh cool this is pretty neat character creation, Woah this is just like GTA! Alright lets go on a mission! Oh.. No one sent against me... No one.. No one.. Oh hey new Mission more people! Yeah We're kicking their faces! Woooh! BAM BAM! Awesome I'm feeling good lets do another mission! Wait.. Why do those guys have gold ic- OH GOD MY SPLEEN OH CRIPES MY LIVER! OH GOD NO HOW DO THEY KEEP KILLING ME!?'   And that's how the game continues on, it's nothing more but a free to play game heavily inserted into pay to win, You got money? you have permanent character upgrades. The mtchups are unbelievably unfair even in a matchmaking server.  Not Recomended unless you just want to go Crim and do nothing but carjack or ram into stores.
2696	1	a	The gameplay is likeable, with some nice gunplay and driving mechanics. similar to that of GTA. The character and vehicle customization is rather amazing. you will probably get hours of gameplay simply from customizing and using your character, not to mention how addictive the game is. This is an ideal free to play game for people who do not want to spend money, considering how real money is not required at all to play. Almost all items in game can be purchased through ingame cash, with the items that are not buyable with ingame cash are extra things. Overall the game is fantastic.
2018	1	a	Awsome Game, But My Computer Get Blue Screen So That â¥â¥â¥â¥ Me Off!
3980	0	a	Stay away from this game.  It's pay to win, free to grind and full of cheaters.  The community is one of the worst you can find anywhere.  Finally it's an over-priced cash grab operation; you have been warned.
3260	1	a	I think this is a quite enjoyable multiplayer game. It's especially fun when you have friends do do it with, as there are missoins to complete in-game and a nice, fun free-roam outside of the missions

3435	1	a	Good ol' APB, I have over 2000+ hours on my other acc where I used to play. However now I moved on over to a second acc due to my main char being removed. Anyway--  ----- Pros: -----  + Customization is GREAT within this game, you can customize anything from your clothes to how your car looks to how your character looks.   + Can get most things in-game for free, there are some weapons on Armas that are a bit too 'OP', that'll get fixed eventually but there are ways to counter weapons that are 'OP' anyway, it's all about teamplay and tactics.  + Not that many hackers around, atleast not for long. (Might take a few days for someone to get banned) It's mostly experienced players, who've been playing the game for a long time and for that reason alone they're being accused of hacking by a majority of players.  ------ Cons:  ------  - Nowhere near as many admins/GM's in-game as there should be, there's lots of things going on in chat that shouldn't. So don't take it to heart if anyone is trying to offend you.   - Some OP Weapons in Armas, as I said they'll probably be fixed in the future ''  - Poor optimization, you'll need a pretty good rig to be able to play this game with decent framerate unless you're willing to alter some text files or download Adv.APB Launcher that'll do just that.  - Takes a few days for hackers to actually get banned, FairFight doesn't work that fast, and sometimes it can ban an innocent player. I have a few friends who've become a victim of this Perma Ban sentance.   ---  There's a bit more than that, but the game itself is FREE, so I'd give it a shot. The Tutorial isn't the best, and the community might be a bit hostile, but there are friendly players who are willing to help you out.
6308	0	a	This game sucks hell, Ive never been writing negative reviews, but because of APB this is my first time. First of all this game is so laggy, i check my ping on other games, its only 130 I am in saudi arabia, i joined Joker NA east Second this game is so buggy, and can cause your computer to crash any time, my computer crashed like 17 times A DAY because of this game. Third why cant we steal other criminal's cars? I mean Hello? We are criminals? we can steal anything we want. This game makes no sense at all.
10502	0	a	It was really fun until Kabam ruined it.
9115	1	a	I would recommend this game mainly because of the great crafting systems it has and is more, 'Oh, you want this? well too bad, either go make it your self or have a tech build it for you.' That might scare so people off, but for people like me who love that sort of game then you might anna give this a try. I also see alot of peopel complaining of slow download times and game crashes, i never had the game crash on me at all and got this thing done downloaded and playing in under 30 minutes, which for me is fast. Another thing Fallen earth does that i like is the fact you can either be in 3rd person or 1st, i for one enjoy it in first person, but to each there own i guess.
299	1	a	This game will suck your 3-incher out of your mum's mouth. 8/10 sucks major chode #stillforfreedoe
1621	1	a	Played APB off and on for a long time before i even had a steam account. The game is definantly worth playing. Why? To be honest, jsut gives you something to do. This game is designed to be played from time to time, or atleast it feels that way. Anyone who reviews this game as a game you paly every single day is doing it wrong. The game has some major issues. Has hackers, ect. The way to avoid this is to stay within bronze and silver threat level, no hacker is going to be bronze or silver, they will be gold. People who pay to win wont be bronze or silver, they will be gold. I let the Pay to win players, and the Hackers go at it, and enjoy some decent well matched game play with some bronze and silver threat level player that dont pay to win nor hack. Would I recommend this game? Absolutely. If custimization, and fast paced game play is your style, this is the game for you. If you are strictly in to just killing people and happen to be some CoD fanboy, this probably isnt your style.

5341	0	a	no, DON'T! Please don't waste your time playing this game. This game is crap, not much people in servers and lots of servers have hackers or annoying players. Gameplay used to be fun and this game had good potential. Not anymore. This game is horrible. Don't spend a cent on their crappy DLC too!

5193	0	a	Its boring theres nothing to do exept walk around and shoot random crap 
8752	0	a	Customization in this game is incredible, sadly hackers have destroyed any will to play. Was one of my favorite shooters.
5130	0	a	It's a p2w. If someone has spent some money in this game, and he is in the enemy team,you are so dead. I don't like how when I started to play,Proffesional players was killing me nonstop in missions. I spent total of 910+ hours.        FFS Make this game play to win not pay 2 win. .I.
3853	0	a	it was fun but turned to â¥â¥â¥â¥ around a year ago and is showing no signs of improvements.  pros: - character and car editors are still unrivaled  cons: - greatly imbalanced gameplay - bad mission and level design - the worst community i've ever seen - huge performance issues - tons of hackers  may 21st 2015 UPDATE: game still bad
8058	0	a	Full of hackers P2W Banned for no reason
8879	1	a	This game is one of the best F2P games I have ever played, and the biggest F2P game I have ever played.  +The game world is huge. It spans over sectors and the overall map is bigger then triple A titles such as GTA V and Just Cause 2.  +Character customisation. When you start the game you have the ability to change the appearance of your character, and during the game you can equip things that can add benefits and features, like dusters or combat suits.  +Clans and teams. In game there is a team system that people can join into so that you can complete a mission together, and some missions require that. The team system also allows voice chat. There is also a clan system that works like normal, and the clan has a special 'clan vault' that they can use.  +Mega server. All players are on one server, but it works due to the map size.  +Vehicles. The game has various mounts, such as horses and even giant mutated chickens, along with motorbikes, ATVs, dune buggys, and more.  -Microtransactions. Since this is a free to play game, it is a given. You can buy almost any item in the game on their store. But I do not mind doing this from time to time, as I enjoy the game to the point that I want to support it.  -Graphics. They aren't very good. Good news for people on lower end PCs like me, but for somebody running a machine that costs as much as a small family vehicle, not so much.  -Voice acting. Barely any of it... at all. It is really BAD, it just isn't common.  -Buggy. Some bugs will occur in the game, but there is usually a fix. Usually.  TL;DR: This game is a pretty fun first person post apocalyptic online RPG. Possibly the only one of its kind. If you liked Fallout, you should try it out. If you hated Fallout, you. I reccomand this game for anyone, really. 
4034	0	a	This Game is bad in every way that isnt making it good. Very Bad. Very, Very Bad

6751	0	a	The typical pay-2-win game. The only game that stats in a weapon mean absolutely nothing. You get into the game and your first prize is to try out the premium membership for 1 day. I have no idea what it gives, neither what advantages I can gather from it. And then, there you go into a confusing game where everything is random. Your party is picked randomly, missions are picked randomly, your level is random. And the tutorial won't help you to understand this case.  The game claims to have a matchmaking on, but you will always randomly join noobs in your team and play against pros. The server itself is lagging awfully, it's hard to control cars or even his own character. The map is fine but not entirely used, some places are useless. Finally, people on the chat are psychotic â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ that cry if someone is better than them because they spent so much money that they wouldn't accept to be beaten anymore. Also, it's full of hackers.  I won't even try again.  
3769	0	a	To summarise before I begin: No.  The game cannot stand from the bloody, mangled mess it is in now.   A small player base which consists primarily of people with similar gametime to mine steal all the fun and prevent new players from being properly introduced to the game. The reason being that new players have almost no chance of beating a good, long-term player and are forced to fight against them because of the small amount of new players and poor matchmaking.   Many people complain about an 'abundance' of hackers, I believe it is simply players that are too fast and familiar with the game for newbies. Doesn't mean it will be a good, fun or balanced experience though.  The gunplay is very fast and unbalanced and requires an itchy trigger finger, high situational awareness and map familiarity to win, so be warned, shooter conservationists.  The new weapons that are being released are typically only able to be purchased with real money. (You're talking $30 to $50 for a permanent, account-wide weapon.) These weapons are considered Pay-2-Win, although I find that every weapon is bad, until it is placed into the right hands. Especially shotguns.  I believe the game only shines through it's beautiful customisation, allowing players to create amazing, intricate articles of clothing, cars and player models. People's creations in the game could even be seen as a form of art.   However, despite this feature's potential, it simply asks too much from the real-life financial standpoint. Free-To-Play players are restricted to very small amounts of customisation and even people that spend stacks of cash on the game are forced to simplify their creations for inevitable reasons like hardware constraints and server storage limits.  I do not recommend this game at all, unless you have LOTS of cash to splash and/or are feeling compelled to play it for whatever reason... You have been warned.
245	1	a	play this game its amazing with friends
5051	0	a	Started playing since the Reloaded beta. 2008 graphics/game, but you still need a mid-high end pc to run this without it FREEZING, barely new content has been added in +4 years, clothes, cars and re skinned guns, some cry about p2w but i think it is pure skill because (re skinned guns). 'Developers' (they cannot change game's code) are now trying to do tons of events giving players a lot of stuff for them to unlock certain clothes, etc, that's not enough, the game is dying, population is so damn low. The engine upgrade was meant to be released in Q1 2014, but they have only given some â¥â¥â¥â¥ing pictures of the SOCIAL DISTRICT with more foliage and better lighting, not even gameplay. I don't even know how are they thinking of releasing a console version lol. They have to release the engine upgrade or just cancel this 5yr old beta.
7455	0	a	I can see why this game flopped. WAY WAY too much learning curve and some apallingly bad design decisions make this a tough game to get into. Not for the weak of heart or short of time. NOT a casual game by any stretch of the imagination. I'd suggest staying away unless you have tons of time to burn.
4590	0	a	This,Game,Is,HORRIBLE!
5922	0	a	look in my screen shots that will explain why the game is â¥â¥â¥â¥
8971	0	a	Outdated graphics, horrible animations, bad sound assets, cluncky controls.... just no
3743	1	a	As of December 22 of 2016 this game is probably one of my favorite games and the most toxic game I have ever played.   To people wanting to know if this game is fun and has content, it does have content and it is fun. But beware of that this game has a toxic community because of people get mad over you being better than them.  Pros - fun - content - customization   Cons - CPU intensive/ ram - toxic community - devs/admins not active - matchmaking (broken) - MoneyZfirst (they'll care about making a quick buck) - no optimization (help your performance)  I wish luck to those who decide to play this game.   Please do keep in mind this is based on my opinion on the game and what it had to offer for the 2 years I've played it, maybe later I write a better review getting in depth about the game and what to expect.
5246	0	a	R.I.P. Wallet
8938	1	a	It's really dead for what it could be, with lots of bugs, but it's still entertaining. gigantic open world to explore and tons of quests to do. Crafting is not that bad after you get the grip of it. played with a friend around 100h outside steam, had good fun. Plus, it's free.
847	1	a	Overall its a pretty epic and unique Pvp open world game. Dont listen to all people that try to make it look bad just because they dont know how to be good at the game.  Its not pay2win! U can beat armas weapons very good with non cash weapons. The best weapons like Ntec, PMG, OCA and HVR are all FREE FOR IN GAME MONEY at contacts.  It just takes much time to learn the game (map knowledge, tactics, weapon control and more).   And its also NOT full of cheaters. Of course there are cheaters but its not even half that worse like in many other f2p games. This Game uses Fairfight Anti Cheat. Fairfight monitores how someone is playing (Check  FFBANS.ORG  to see most banned players from APB).  The customization possibilities of APB are just unique. U can almost make every design you want on your cars and clothing :) (Thats why it needs this high amount of RAM) Well about performance its not very optimized because its a old unreal engine version very heavy modified.  Engine upgrade for PC should come after they released the Ps4 version on which they currently working on. But it can run well at 40-60fps when u own a good 4 core Cpu, 8 GB of Ram (its waaay more CPU and RAM intense than GPU intense) and a Gpu with 1 - 1,5Gb of Vram. Of course it depends on your Graphic settings. You can make more detailed graphics Settings with Advanced APB Launcher (search APB forums to find the download for it)..   So give it a try and start learning and u will see its just great.
7451	0	a	A great Game!!! But not really much fun for Free to Play People. There are to much Bonuses for others. Not well balanced. But the Gameplay and Concept is a Plus to look at it closer. Free to play Titel 6/10.
6123	0	a	pay to win. you can get an early shot on a person but they will still kill you because they have faster fire rate and more accuracy. hitboxes are â¥â¥â¥â¥. when you shoot someone in the head you expect to kill them but no, all it does is deal the same amount of damage as a body shot
8210	0	a	IF you actually manage to get this game to open and then work you way through tediously creating an account with a third party.  Gameplay 3/10 - Quite laggy and driving a car is very difficult while lagging. There is a very steep learning curve and you are thrown in the deep end Community - 0/0 - Toxic... Expect to be insulted and flamed from the get go Graphics - 6/10 - Nothing amazing  It's basically a poorer version of GTA online. I really wouldn't waste your time  
1016	1	a	Practically GTA Online without the GTA
9120	1	a	I've never played this but steam says I have so here is my review. This game is playable. (i think)
5548	0	a	this is bull i cannot play this game
7696	0	a	The first impression is that you're in for an amazing experience. But the more you spend playing, the more you realise how much troublesome it is to play this game. Firstly, the servers are underwhelming. Secondly, the game is absolutely pay to win. I repeat, you WILL NOT be able to achieve ANYTHING WORTHWHILE in THIS DONKEY GAME unless you're willing to spend your whole monthly savings. A no from me.
2297	1	a	Big Guns, Large Scale Shootouts, Fast Cars, and Total Anarchy?   F*CK YEAH!!! This is a great game for the ones who like guns, Cars, And (Gang?) Warfare.   On my pc (i5), the game lacks a miniscule amount of frames.   It takes a it to run, but overall,    IT'S A DAMN GREAT GAME!     - 419NigerianPrinceEA  (Please don't send me your EA username &amp; Password It's just a joke)

1505	1	a	Well... not bad, not much good... I think you just need to try it...yeah...  SCORE: 69/100 (I guess)
4104	0	a	If you are not willing to spend $1500.00 on the game then dont get it. Its a P2P community where the kids cant earn anything so they steal their moms credit card and buy all the more powerful weapons.   While the players who want to play without putting any real money into the game have to use crappy guns with crappy accuracy, and the only way to get anything decent (Which you can only have for a short period of time) takes months of grinding. Ive played this game for 119.3 hrs and only gotten just over $17000.00 ingame cash. Which doesn't get you anything good if you were wondering.   This game is a waste of time and there are many other games out there that beat this one in overall performance and quality of the community, I give this game a -100 out of 10 due to its lack of free to play compatability ingame and its lack of a mature and friendly community, all I see in this game is a bunch of rich 10 year olds who get their parents to give them $500 allowance a week to spend on this â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ game.  For your own sake and the sake of you're mental ability to play and have fun.   Dont download this game, play minecraft or something, which overall is a million times better than this â¥â¥â¥â¥ show.
5605	0	a	WHATEVER YOU DO. DO NOT INSTALL THIS GAME. FOR YOUR OWN SANITY.  Literally came back to check on the game and it is â¥â¥â¥â¥ED by hackers. LITERALLY BENT.
4258	0	a	Great game to play if you are not planing on spending money on it. If you are planing to spend money on it DONT, waste of money and its just fkin squeezing money out of you with no rewards for you.
7644	0	a	I think i'll give you a thumbs up if you could balanced that ranking system.. like seriously i'm only rank 50, fighting against rank 255 with full modded weapons and vehicles and an instant death grenade launcher / OSMAW.. this is seriously stupid and i've lost interest in it.. threat system is stupid and not balanced.. the high ranked player 195++ will easily owned Gold with just a normal weapon without character modifications at all.. absurd and stupid..
7483	0	a	Gets boring real easily. Customizations to your character and vehicles are extremely expensive, and you get killed a lot!
8374	0	a	Game Status Long Ago: Very Playable, Good Latency  Game Status Now: Unplayable, Horrible Latency   The Latency beats over all the customization with nearly 1000 latency playing normal.  The game is just unplayable now.
6818	0	a	Used to be a good game since I had nothing else to do. Now that I have Csgo, this is utter BS. Dont play this. It is basically a game where people who pay for their guns will always win. Spend a little money and actually get a good game you will like rather than play these free games.
8620	0	a	run while you still can
1756	1	a	Spent a little bit of time in this game, and there's a good amount of in game purchases (what did you expect, it's a free game) but I still enjoyed and will continue to enjoy this game. I would recommend it.
5901	0	a	I hate this game so much...I keep crawling back tho. I dont recomend this game
3258	1	a	come try this game out with me! my name in game= Mimistacy (enforcer) its not that populair but a bunch of ppl still play it! super fun game and rek ppl on and also costume ur own cool car/costumes (see my screenshots of APB)  HAVE FUN xxx
2111	1	a	worst game ever, totally sucks :3
754	1	a	I've played this game more than 200h and its still fun. =DD
8890	0	a	I truly want to like this game. It is a post-apocalyptic MMORPG, reminiscent of Mad Max but with a much greater technological and traditional science fiction slant. It is an FPS, with a proper akimbo system and a good variety of firearms. It has delightful melee weaponry in all the flavors one would expect and desire from such a game. The landmarks of classic MMORPG gameplay are all there: mobs, crafting, looting, harvesting, and all the economic factors that come with them. On paper, it is the MMORPG of my dreams, and years ago it was probably up to the task of meeting my dreams fabulously.  Unfortunately, it seems someone forgot about it. Development has stagnated almost completely, its team brutally eviscerated and scattered in the desert. It has aged as well as tropical fruit on the windowsill, no longer pleasing to the senses. The combat is flat, awkward, and crippled by latency issues. Performance is what you would typically expect from an MMORPG, but with some inexplicable stutters and framerate drops that you would not (given the level of visual flair and fidelity). There is an option for Advanced Post FX which is apparently vaseline on the viewport that destroys what little definition and detail the game actually has.  In essence, it has all the ingredients of a fantastic MMORPG and may very well have been one at some point in time, full of promise and ambition. It's such a shame that it has aged so poorly, received little in the way of meaningful updates in the past few years, and seems to embrace a trend of short-lived fascination for new players and long-term disappointment for veterans. It achieves the goal of feeling desolate and abandoned - as all wastelands should - but not in the way that makes a game something one looks forward to jumping into; instead, it feels like one that everyone is quite eager to jump out of, and justifiably so.
5782	0	a	wot a peece of sheet
7298	0	a	This game has a great idea, but just wrong developement of said idea. There are too many cheaters, and it is so pay to win.
7495	0	a	This game has the potential to be awesome but it sucks on so many levels. First off it is a massive grind, you have to invest a substantial amount of time into it to be able to unlock anything at all, even if you pay the monthly fee to increase your rates. On top of that you have a broken weapon system that leaves every weapon with an unrealistic niche forcing you to buy a ton of weapons to be able to fight in different areas of the map otherwise the guy with the weapon better tailored for that alleyway or that elevated highway is going to win regardless of how good he/you are.   The biggest flaw however is the ranking system in this game. It is absolutly impossible to play this game as a new player and have a decent time learning the game because the tiered ranking system apparently plays no role whatsoever in matchmaking. There are servers tiered for each rank on the list, but they are not locked for that rank so someone well beyond your skill level as judged by the game can join your server and will get matched against you in the matchmaking system every... single... game. It just isn't fun getting destroyed mission after mission by female avatars in knee stockings and miniskirts, or flat naked who have hours upon hours more invested in the game to unlock all of the guns and perks and cars and whatever else.   Game sucks, do yourself a favor and go get just cause 2 if you want a freeform driving multiplayer game, or world of warcraft if you want to spend hours of your life doing the same repetative â¥â¥â¥â¥ for hours on end to raise up in level.
7378	0	a	2/10 wouldn't recomend to a dead person, eats the liveing â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of your ram if not then their is almost always a memory leakage for non 64bit systems &amp; microtransactions around every corner almost everyone is either a hacker, glitch exploiter or paid a ton of money for anything as useless as a â¥â¥â¥â¥ stain on their shoes, would rarther rip my balls off and play call of duty 4 with a lobby full of prepubescent 9 yearolds.
4306	0	a	Played it for a little bit.  Didn't care for it very much.

3257	1	a	Its a really fun game, u can play as a cop or criminal, I perfer criminals
4408	0	a	This is a horrible game.
2675	1	a	FIX THE SERVERS!!!!!! Im never able to connect.
9460	1	a	There is is thing i didn't know about this game im glad i found this out, its called......TRASH!!! UNINSTALLED
462	1	a	It's free
7568	0	a	This game requires that you downgrade your graphics drivers pretty heavily for the game to even launch at all. Sorry APB, but I'm not going back to 2011's geForce drivers just for you.
6202	0	a	Piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥. Needs to be burned
9213	0	a	Fallen Earth is an excelent thought, but it has crapy controlles and graphics. They also did not put a lot of time on fixing glitches in the graphics.I would not recommend this to anyone that wants to have fun.
7932	0	a	So, I played about two hours of this game. And instead of trying to break it down here's my pro/cons  PRO: Character generator is great. The Idea could be really fun.  CONS: The game itself, While it has good concepts, It ends up being glitchy, non-player friendly and the player base, at least for the Eastern NA server is dead.  Micro-Transactions, Like, Too many, there's not enough free-content for the game to hold itself up.  All and all, maybe if i got over the first few hours of play, it might be a passable game, but sadly, i don't see it coming up more than passable.
10112	1	a	Seems like a good game, controls are a bit complicated or you can say different. But great amount of customization and huge map with a fair amount of playerbase. I would recommend this for people who don't really play alot of shooters and can easily accept the controls and complexness of the game.
1165	1	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ me in the â¥â¥â¥
755	1	a	If you're not Trucking, you're doing it wrong. If you don't know what Trucking is, you haven't even played the game.
10901	1	a	A GREAT game, just a horrible company bought it that can't control breaches, turned the game into a money maker, and sucked the life out of RotMG. The GAME I recommend, the company, on the other hand, should go under.
4304	0	a	Customization is really good and can spend hours just making your character. Downside is the gameplay and lack of playerbase now, it's slowly dieing. Massively Pay2Win, you can beat every player with paid guns though, if you're looking to put effort into a dead game.
258	1	a	good game but the city is to small 
3889	0	a	The game does not have a big enough playerbase for new players to get into the game.  Started off my first game against people that had better pistols than my assault rifle. I was getting sniped before even getting to the objective with a revolver.   So if you're not down to put $60-100 into the game there's no way you're gonna be able to enjoy this.
3286	1	a	Customization is amazing.  Yes, the game is difficult. (learning curve 3steep)  No, there's no p2w.
3423	1	a	Best free game ever made download asap!
6601	0	a	this is to laggy.....
6200	0	a	foucking game 
10257	0	a	This game needs a lot of work before it can become even close to being good.
4480	0	a	Bad GTA 0/10 Just Buy GTA YoU CHEAP â¥â¥â¥â¥S
7290	0	a	Quite sucks can't even shoot the window lol &gt;.&lt;
7820	0	a	You ever wonder what it's like when you mix elements such as Massive Multiplayer online capabilities and Great free-roaming environments together? Heh, me too... You might want to check any game other than this one. So, go on, get out of here before your elders see you desacrating your family honor...
146	1	a	Pros - Customizability. Yes there is a limit when you have a free acount when it comes to decals on cars and clothes but it is still a lot that you can fo.  - Getting together with friends. APB is quite a lot of fun with a lot of friends and you just mess around the entire time  -Gameplay. Even though many people find it repititive i still found it quite enjoyable to play and I think have logged something like 200/300 hours into this game.   Cons: -Terrible servers -Terrible developers  - Hackers. Hackers everywhere.
6847	0	a	This game is extremly unbalanced. When ever you start a mission against someone there is no ranking system, it's only randomized where you and your friends that are new to the game fight agains players that have spent hours and cash on this game. And even after a while when you have played the game the other players have to strong weapons and vehicals for you to even do anything.  With that said  -Unbalanced -Pay to win  
7651	0	a	Doesn't accept passwords, takes forever to load on SATA III SSD.
9401	1	a	I was almost addicted to this game! There is such a vast world! I love it!
1407	1	a	-started game -made character in hopes of creating bad @$$ yakuza boss -ended up with typical japenese thug in wife beater and jeans -robbed a black man who was a black belt in judo -got van full of stolen goods stolen by other criminals -cried 9/10 potatoes would play again
5475	0	a	It's very pay to win.   You do a mission. The enemy team paid for their things. It's basically their game now..
8517	0	a	Dont Get me wrong the Game is funn but theres some game changing bugs such as if someone is close enough to the wall the can shoot you through it killing you. another thing theres only one server For NA(North America) and theres way to admins that abuse i was kicked about 12 times in the middle of gameplay i enjoyed playing for a bit but the admins really didnt allow me to play its worth downloading if you Are able to play without getting kicked. good luck dont download this game if you dont have the patients
4216	0	a	f**k this â¥â¥â¥â¥
3467	1	a	good game apart from the other powered players.
4450	0	a	Anti-cheat banned me for no reason. Worst game ever...
2713	1	a	Really good F2P gta alternative!
7624	0	a	It looked cool at first. A GTA like game where you could be a criminal or a vigilante cop, fighting for control of the streets. I was hugely disappointed. It has extremely little story content. There is way too much competition for missions. Say you need to kill a guy. When you find him, turns out someone else got him. This happens over and over. The missions are just instanced PVP. Thats all the game is- PVP. Yeah, I know that's the main aspect of the game, but it doesnt work. GTA mechanics are just copied, and they are much lamer. I played some GTA games before, and it gives you an adrenaline rush, speeding away from cop cars and helicopters. APB doesn't give you the same feeling. You would think that more people and another side- vigilantes- would enhance gameplay. It sorely fails.  In short, GET THE REAL GTA GAMES. Not this copy piece of crap.
10573	1	a	This game has taken over my life. Like seriously. My friend asked me to play all 200 hours ago and my god am I now addicted. The perma death stops you from playing but once you're used to it you just never stop playing. Every waking hour will be spent playing this. It is fun, the perma death is annoying, but once you get used to killing big stuff it's amazing. Better with friends.
6445	0	a	I had quite a bit of fun when i played this game. Even setting aside the rampant, unchecked cheating. Or the people gaming the ranking system to bring their rank down from gold or silver to play on bronse.   What finally put me completely off was when i tried to use a controller. It completely broke the game for me. Even after i tried to go back to KB+M, there was some kind of glitch that made it so i was constantly turning to the left, and throwing grenades also fired my weapon.   When I tried to get support, both G1 and Steam said, 'not our problem, talk to them', and pointed at each other.
9291	0	a	Wont get load beyond the launch screen
2419	1	a	Very fun game with cars of your own! I recromend it to all my friends who like to customize their cars and add parts to it!
333	1	a	It's nice game!
3719	1	a	I've been playing this game on and off for 3 years. There's something about it that's so addicting. Sure I have GTA and all that, but it's just not the same. It's a gem amidst all the other free to play games. Really it is...  There is a big emphasis on teamwork so grouping with a friend is recommended. Best character customization I have seen to date. It has its flaws and is highly pay to win. The matches are competitive but when you do kick a person's â¥â¥â¥ that has spent a ton of money on the game from outsmarting them and knowing the tips and tricks well damn that makes you feel like a god.
3926	0	a	Spent about 10 minutes trying to get this game to work on my computer. Won't launch at all, unless you count an irritating Facebook popup. Complete failure to launch for a game that by all reports has serious connectivity issues and a questionable business model. Coupled with a game that wants me to essentially disable the functionality in windows that allows my security software to function, and I could not reccomend this to anyone.
4495	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ balance. New player are put against the best ones gg
7604	0	a	Laggy gameplay, car physics broken, seemingly bad input lag, under average shooting mechanics. There are better free games out there than this.
1982	1	a	Yo
10011	0	a	I decided to play this game in the good faith of APB's Succes (IMO) And to even put this game under the name of GamersFirst Is a big mistake! I thought this would be THE Fallout online thing, boy oh boy was I wrong xD... You start off as a dude underground, some â¥â¥â¥â¥ happens, you die and Wake up again, being told that you're a clone, You go out of the chosen bunker and die to everything because the only thing you got is a freaking paintball gun.... Jesus  Alas I played it for about 30 hours before steam and let me just tell you right now Nothing is gonna happen I wandered for so long collecting ressourses only to find out I needed half a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥on more of something to craft anything And when I finally got those damn things it took me about 3 hours to craft.... this game, brings depression!
2616	1	a	IDK I NEVER GOT INTO IT THATS PROBABLY A SIGN!!!! DUDUNDDDNUDNUDNDUNd

2915	1	a	game is good i really like it but we need a Australian Server or something as i get a huge lag and makes it hard for me to play.
3274	1	a	this is very awesome game i want this game to live through ages and this game will live forever
4830	0	a	It took me 1000 hours to come to my senses....  Don't be like me.... Don't download this...
51	1	a	Nice game ;D I thinkin this game need lithuania language ^^
9826	0	a	  &gt;installed game &gt;ran the game &gt;made account &gt;saw that it needed a third-party installer &gt;closed and uninstalled  waste of time/10
9922	1	a	there are few open world games which cost ($) but this one is free with third-person view as well as first-person view with nice weapons but the annoying creatures that want to kill you run the same pace so its had to esccape and when I ran I died at least 4 times in a row!
9660	1	a	When I first played, I wanted to stop. But when I went on, I love the game.
8350	0	a	This game is strictly pay-2-win  The only way you can win is spend money to get a decent weapon, or be the best player in the world. 
10882	1	a	Realm of mad god may have many microtransactions but there is no need to spend anymoney they give your 400g at the begining of the game to get you started so u can buy 1 item and gt the rest buying the items is not nessasary some arent even rare (and they cost like 5$) and you can trade items you dont need for items you want (pots are the best) so lvl up go kill god/dungeon bosses and get your loot
5788	0	a	You'll only enjoy this game if your good. Other than that its a rage fest. Its not a pay to win, but as I said you need skill to enjoy the game or win it. Other than that the customization is amazing, but you need premium to put more than 5 decals on a car, 25 decals in an emblem, or 5 decals on clothing. The matchmaking is a complete mess, new people will really have a hard time when they get matched up with veterans...  I only recommend this game if you have the patience to die a lot.
627	1	a	puts a fun creative spin on cops and robbers with the adition of guns,cars and hole lot of customization toping it of with the fact  its massmultiplayer and free roam U CAN BE CRIMANLES AND KILL TINGS CAUSE U KNOW THATS WHAT CRIMS DO
6523	0	a	Never spend money on a free game. If you download this, you'll either have to buy your gear or spend hundreds of hours trying to keep up with the frequent spenders.  This game is realy just fun for the moment, not a long term game.
358	1	a	One of the most addictive open-world games I've played in a really long time. APB is great fun and packed full of unlockable in-game material such as vehicles, clothes, weapons, and many others. Plenty of features to keep you occupied for a very long time. Best part: It's free. Highly recommended.
8866	0	a	Downloaded enormous game file. This took an entire day.  Created account.  Read EULA. Standard stuff.  Read SECOND EULA. Code of conduct and a few weird roleplay related rules. Mental note to stay away from those servers.  Downloaded five hundred updates. Another day is now nearly over.  Loading screen / ad.  Create character.  Loading screen / ad.  Finally get to make my first gameplay related keystrokes.  Game freezes after 4 seconds of play.  Wait.  Game resumes.  Punch small man.  Small man yells at me.  Game freezes.  Wait.  Game crashes.  Uninstall.  Moral: you get what you pay for.
8107	0	a	boring game , cheap gta rip off
9515	0	a	What the hell!!! I went through all of the time making an account for this game, to be back at the login screen with it prompting me for a username and a password, when the acccount creation didn't allow me to enter in a username, anywhere. Dumbasses! How am I supposed to log in with something I don't have?
6903	0	a	Honestly, I really like this game. Its free to play and fun to play but it always glitches and lags too much to even pretend to play. If it wasnt for that Id highly recomend it but there seems to be no fix for the lag and whatnot 
8819	0	a	this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥ don't play it
3977	0	a	pay to win with some of the biggest pay walls i have ever seen
10362	1	a	Used to be sweet, now G1 bought em out and it kinda sucks. Free2play Pay2win
3835	0	a	It's like a drug. It's bad for you, but you can't stop. I spent over $200.

2450	1	a	i cant download it can any body help me with the instructions :(
2029	1	a	I just wish they make it more good game
5079	0	a	This game sucks first of all i hate games where you have to log in its the gayest thing ever and it sucks. lots of problems when i finshed makeing my character it wounldnet let me join a game so this game sucks hate this waste of space do not download not worth it .
7001	0	a	It is a pain to download!
3628	1	a	Great game in my opinion ... :3
5954	0	a	Lagspikes even on Minimal settings (changing video settings hardly even matter) when I can run high quality games from 2014-2015.   - Bad engine. - Mostly p2w. - Boring missions. - Toxic community.  I regret spending 240+ hours on this game.
9387	0	a	Horrible, HORRRRRRRRRRIIIIIBBBBLLLLE.. I unistalled this garbage before the tutorial or whatever you want to call it was. Sounds are missing, enimies run around at mach 12, buggy trash. Do not waste presious time off your life to even attempt to play this.
560	1	a	Note: This game is NOT pay to win, people with no time and skill spent into this game are full of ****. So put that aside â¥  List of goods and bads of this game below  Good: -Good quality team fights -Great customisation (Clothes, themes, vechicles, graffiti sprays) -Open world fights (Can literally flank from anywhere) -Weapons paid for ingame cash(Weeks time for a weapons for ingame cash) -Easy market system -Preferred maps (There is 2 type maps, one focuses on close range and one on long)  Bad: -Engine promises for years (Graphic update that never happend) -Toxic players -Couple of glitches (Car glitches into map) -Bad optimisation (Game is not very well optimised and will freeze every couple of minutes)   These are my opinions from playing 1256 hours  Hope to see the game get fixed up and play more with a future engine update.
1473	1	a	This game is so much fun! I find it fun for a free game and i dont like free games.
539	1	a	Start in a crappy car and then get screwed up by grenades in missions, start doing stunts around the city, land the car on your squad member R.I.P Chicken Nuggetz :(
5780	0	a	trying ot get it to work the struggle is real
3405	1	a	Well, the balance system is a do-it-even-exist but it has the most advanced character custumization system ive seen and the environment in missions is awesome so its worth testing
1441	1	a	Fantastic. It is basically GTA online but not GTA? Then get this!
8943	0	a	Graphics we very 'meh'. After awhile, it got very repetitive with the level grinding. There were also major bugs when I played, but I'd say a good half of them have been fixed since. I haven't chosen to return to this game because I hit the level cap and it wasn't interesting enough to justify paying for it.
2328	1	a	Great online FPS and Driving simulator combined into some unforgettable PvP action. Cars exploding during missions and a true cops versus robbers feel. 100 people per zone at once, so great feel of a live city during combat.
7636	0	a	As soon as it was done installing, it would just show a small box and not the actual game so thats why I'm going to uninstall then reinstall to see if it works. If it does I'll send a Yes on recommending it, if it doesn't then I'm going to try to send a No on recommending it and go talk to someone about it.
8279	0	a	Can--Can I make a review without being shot in the face by my team mates? Yes? O-Okay.. *Clears my throat* This is my first review so live with me here..  OKAY! I'm going to go through MY experience with this game. It was......Meh. This game is about Criminals wanting to take control of the city, and basically the cops issues Marshal law, so they kill the criminals. You get the Idea, anyways, when I first started, I LOVED, the character maker. SO much you can do to your Character, like adding Tattoos, scars, changing hair, eye, and even nail colour. I made a pretty Bad â¥â¥â¥ enforcer guy, and he's pretty sweet, but I'm rambling. So, you spawn in, right? No Idea what the hell to do, so you just ask around on the chat box, and IMMEDIETLY get cussed out by some white trash wannabe trying to be cool. So, I shrugged it off and learned what to do, making my way up. Now, get this, you can buy stuff with ingame money and real money. Like..Gear that you can KEEP. Guns, no, They expire in 10 days and you have to RE-buy them for like, 1000 in game money. (Price range may Vary) But, back to the community in this game. If you're looking for back stabbing team mates who shoot you in the face, White trash gangsta kids talking â¥â¥â¥â¥ to you, and all around a community that makes the Call of Duty one look like they're nice people? THEN THIS GAME IS THE GAME FOR YOU, SIR-AND OR- MADAM! Thing is, this game gets oddly addictive when you want to keep your character looking badass, But the money is so difficult to get because most of the time, New people at the game have no chance to do good in this game at the start. You're instantly put with people who have better guns and gear, to kill your sweet butt with. And in the end you end up Raging your heart out cause your team mate shoots you with a double barrel in the back cause you tried to play the damn objective! The only Reason why I keep the game, IS FOR THE CHARACTER COUSTIMIZATION! Only reason. Right there. Other than that this game is a Putrid mess of hackers, trash talkers, 12 year olds who scream into the damn mic every five seconds, and back stabbing team mates! I rate this game.....   3/10!  Ony reason to keep: To make and improve your Character.  That is all! I hope you found my review some what helpful! Peace!
5776	0	a	cant even play when its starting it just freezes and i have to restart my computer samething when i got it from the website if fixed i will try again for now dont download
5945	0	a	Cant first person why its easy to add in
10199	1	a	itÂ´s a good game, a bit difficult the further into the game you get. However, some obstacles have not stopped anyone from trying until you passed it. Any good gamer can agree.
7667	0	a	The customization is awesome! The match making is terrible. I really really wanted to play this. I LOVE THE CUSTOMIZATION! I just can't take getting brutally murdered on every single mission and people telling me how all silvers need to go kill themselves. Playing vs other bronze players the game is fun. You are both new your weapons kind of suck and it's ok. The second you hit silver you will be massacred again and again and expect both your team mates and the other team (they can whisper you to tell you exactly what kind of an a*#hole you are and how your getting 'rekt!nub silver die!*) to berate you constantly. This makes starting out not only frustrating, but no fun at all. I don't want to be a pretty piece of cannon fodder for P2winners, hackers, and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ bags. It's kind of funny that the game's anti cheat thinger is called fair fight when nothing past bronze is even sort of fair. Do I want to spend the time watching myself die over and over again so that maybe I can unlock things that will even the score for a game that might (and probably should) die soon? No thanks. Also the hit detection is godawful. If you think shooting someone in the head should count for as many points as shooting them in the foot? You should ignore my review and play apb.
6585	0	a	its a really fun game, the world is expansive and you can customize the music, cars, clothes and many other things which is a pretty big plus.. but no matter how hard you work, its very oriented toward people who buy stuff in game, no matter how hard you worked for that machine gun by doing missions, you only get it for maybe a few days or a week, but if you buy it, its yours for good.  but ig your ok with that then this is your game, but I myself hate when someone a lower level blows me to bits with a machine gun and leaves me in the dust using a muscle car that goes double my speed, making it a quickly ending speed chase.  and even though it says I only played for an hour or so, I've had days of playing this game before I had it on steam, sad the say that it hasnt changed.
1019	1	a	Fun to play with friends
3285	1	a	Ebola Game :) been playing it for about 3 to 4 years...
10683	0	a	This game used to be a very fun and exciting game to play. But ever since Kabam took over, the game became a Pay to Win game. You could buy end game items in the nexus with money and stuff. The game is now filled with Hackers, Dupers, Multiboxers, and etc. R.I.P, RotMG.

10023	1	a	well let me start out with saying...  when i first tried to login it didn't work so yeah i used 2 hours to try and fix it.  then i went to the loading screen it took FOREVER. and the graphics looks like it was made in 2007 but the gameplay worked fine so i would say... 5/10 
6793	0	a	This game gave me cancer. It is simply awful. I do NOT recommend it.
2650	1	a	its a awesome game
8573	0	a	It takes years to load up the game fix it please!
2909	1	a	APB is an awesome Cops and Robbers game pitting player against player in a fight to control the city. The high customization, as well as the firefights and car chases ensure this game will be high on your favorite games list. 8.5/10
10093	1	a	Really Interesting Game, If You And Your Friends Like Kinda Sorta End Of The World Stuff Then You Will Like This Game. Although It Cannot Fully Capture The, 'End Of The World' Feel, Being An MMO And All.
9607	0	a	Freemium trash game. You're not allowed to use the chat unless you pay. Can't do half the content unless you pay. Have a money cap unless you pay...  Unplayable unless you pay. 1/10, crappy freemium games that are money greedy. You will regret every minute invested, when a moderator bans you for chatting, or when you find out about the money cap / other p2w aspects, â¥â¥â¥â¥ this â¥â¥â¥â¥.
7676	0	a	no start why??
5301	0	a	This game SUCKS.
9800	0	a	I played it. Got renamed to a ridiculous name because my name offended the you know who. Then the same mod who had renamed me popped up in main chat to ask people to keep the discussion to game related Q&amp;A. I wasnt even chatting at the time, and the people who were were simply chit chatting. Apparently this is too much for this concentration camp of a game. No fun allowed. Only talk about the game.  I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hate this â¥â¥â¥â¥. Burn down every game company that manages its users like stupid cattle. God forbid giving personal details or talking about fun stuff. It might create you know, DISCUSSION. We dont want that. We want stupid morons who only talk about the game and pay their dues. Die. Eat it and die.

2287	1	a	 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APB:_Reloadedi :  APB: All Points Bulletin is a multiplayer online video game for Microsoft Windows based in urban sprawls and featuring two factions, Enforcers and the Criminals. Players can join either the Enforcers or the Criminals, and form sub-groups in either faction. The game design was led by David Jones, who contributed to the original Grand Theft Auto and Crackdown, and was developed by Realtime Worlds. It was released on 6 June 2010 in North America, and Europe.  On 17 August 2010 Realtime Worlds was placed into administration. The administrators intended to keep the company trading whilst they attempted to find a buyer for the firm. If a buyer could not be found then the long-term future for the game was uncertain. On 16 September 2010 Realtime Worlds announced APB servers were to be shut down 'soon' with no specific date given. On 11 November 2010 online games company, K2 Network, purchased APB for Â£1.5 million. No time frame for re-release or reactivation of servers was announced. On 16 November 2010 K2 subsidiary company Reloaded Productions, announced that APB will be relaunched during the first half of 2011 as a free to play game, renamed APB: Reloaded. ----------  I bought the game so I was bummed when they ended up tanking, I found it worth the money, but it was good news that they found someone to pass the torch to. Even though being f2p it is mainly for aesthetics and permanent guns but you can still purchase the same weapons that last temporarily with in-game money you earn from missions and killing other players and still have customizable things you can earn to make your character look unique which I believe is very in depth. One of the coolest things about this game is the ability to create your own artwork with shapes and various tools which some people can create some of the coolest detailed things with to apply to clothing and your own personal vehicles.   I highly recommend it given that it is the best f2p game in this genre like GTA available and the combat is challenging and action packed with grenade throwing, vehicles exploding, and bullets flying. It is even possible to place players on the criminal faction 'under arrest' with stun gun weapons and hand cuffs can earn more points. It is also hilariously humiliating to them and you can often hear them curse over the built in VOIP which makes it even better to feel like you've put scum in it's place.
5711	0	a	not good its not what you think 1/10
5873	0	a	its not very good in general the animations arew choppy the leveling system is bugged and it feels like a gta 3 clone
6108	0	a	P2W oriented game
7229	0	a	You need to spend to much money for have decent things.  I like it for a long time but, is not for my like now.   And now i can't download it, so, try to thing better about your fans.
996	1	a	i played this on and off till 2010. many ppl are getting frustrated so i try to make this quick for completly new players.   is it p2w?  only if you compare 1on1 situations. but it is NOT in a mixed team. that said, the game is frustrating at first and has a steep learing curve, you will start enjoying it after 150h or so. befor that, its a pain. i still play this with the starter weapon, because its the most versatile gun with a random team of people.  the game is heavily build around range, so your gun is only effective in certain scenarios. sub-machine guns/shotguns for close encounters, assault rifles for mid-range, snipers for longrange and machine guns against hard targets (cars). there are alot of niche roles but don't bother with them at first.  your starting weapon is a  mid-range  assault rifle (STAR 556). the gun is basically good in most situations but won't exceed in any. if you keep that in mind and don't let the enemy lure you into situations where your weapon is inferior (basically situations where you try to kill a sniper at high range or outperform a shotgun in close quarter), the odds are mostly even and only movement and skill will decide the outcome.  thats about it. 2 veteran players can easly outmaneuver and destroy a whole group of players with payed weapons with just positioning and granate throwing skills... sure there are alot of veteran players out there with payed guns and a ton of hours gameplay which are deadly in most encounters but it's not the payed guns, its mainly good gameplay.  the game is also very 'ragey' and full of trolls. don't know about the hackers too... also since g1 took this game over i think the server-performance is pretty â¥â¥â¥â¥, type '/fps' ingame to see your performance, if your fps spike to often in battle, just don't play it. you will lose because of bad latency and its frustrating.  overall i can recommend it, its free, great tactical gameplay. its mostly skill based with a very harsh learning curve.
1327	1	a	Okay I only have a few hours on this game BUT I can honstely say for being 'FREE' it's not to bad. There is a P2W (Pay to Win for those who don't know) feel to it but not a lot of P2Wer's in the game the real problem are the hackers and oh so fearful 2 mp/h cars (You will die if struck by a car going 2 mph). AGAIN! It's free and not to bad of a game you will get mad here and there but that's life! Also so many hackers and A1 does nothing about them -_-
8632	0	a	I do think this game is fun, but it is broken at the same time. The radar sucks in this game, there is hackers. But there is hackers in so many games that I play on here. It's kind of like H1Z1: Just Survive with cops and robbers, that is the best way i can explain it. Your best bet is to go in with people you know   Edit: After playing this game quite a bit, it is a play to win. You want to pay to win? You will be amazing at this game, there is a lot of hackers and rage quitting will happen. Best way to play is to go in with people that you know, it makes it easier and fun. But you will ALWAYS run into trolls and hackers no matter what.
9487	0	a	Honestly I Probably might like this game if it wasn't for  A)The 3rd Party EULA/Login  and B) the fact i couldn't login even though i had signed up  Hopefully this will be fixed.
331	1	a	about the game: The good, the bad and the ugly  The good:  -there is no other game like it -its not pay2win,the most powerful weapons are free -awezome costumization of character, symbols and cars  The bad:  -HUGE skill diference between players (check notes at the end of the review) -every now and then a patch buffs a weapon that was not supposed to get buffed. -a few times missions needs balancing (drop points or timers will give an advantage to one of the teams)  The ugly:  -toxic community (not recommended for people that gets offended easly - might learn how to ignore toxic people if you survive enought in this game) (there is nice people, but the toxic people makes a lot of noise in this game) -its a third person shooter. it plays completely diferent from a first person shooter. so if you're used to CoD or CS, you will have to get used to a completely diferent kind of game.  Notes:  -it looks like g1 is working hard now to finish the engine upgrade - give them time. a lot of players are tired of waiting for it since it was announced some years ago, but they have now another company putting some pressure on them. also, it looks like they want to balance things out.  -in this game, you recibe a threat level (it indicates how good you play). green,bronze,silver and gold. you're put automatically inside a district that is supposed to gather players from the same threat level. for (reasons), this doesnt happend. silver district is full of golds and bronze district is full of silvers. this creates something interesting: 2 worlds. the bronze district, where bronze and silvers hang out, a more newbie friendly place to learn the game. and the silver district, full of silvers that likes to take a big challange and golds. the silver districts will be hell on earth for all new players, they will be put against very strong oposition and wont have any chance of winning. yet, silvers and golds of the bronze district wont be as good and strong as silvers of the silver district.  -the matchmaking system needs some work (its scheduled for rework after the engine update) it will work with whatever is on the district you're in. that means sometimes you will be fighting oposition way stronger than you, or way weaker than you. its something you have to get used to.  -because of newbies being put against veterans, 2 things happends: 1- people start thinking there are a lot of hackers in this game (false - if we put a silver in CS:GO against a global elite and dont tell him anything, he will think the global elite is hacking) and 2- it looks like the game is P2W (again, false - most powerful weapons are free. but old players like to have permanent nice looking weapons, so they buy one with real money. as they have a lot more experience, they will always win the gunfights, and the new players tend to blame the gun for that)  -you will need some patience to learn the game, its a diferent and unique kind of game. but if you know wich districts to be on your skill level, its a fun game, and worth it
4002	0	a	This mmo is totally unbalanced, and is pay to win. I don't recommend it.
5046	0	a	Not worth the download.   Community is terrible, getting teamkilled during the tutorial for not knowing the mission metagame was great. The driving isn't fun, car handling is mushy and seems like driving on ice all the time(it's not winter). The weapons and shooting aren't great either, seems like a grind fest, but without anything to grind against. 
9271	1	a	I've played Fallen Earth from 2012, and here's my Review and heres why most people don't know what there talking about when it comes to negative Reviews.  This game Defines Apocolyptic MMO RPGs as one of the greatest yet.  Here's why Players put all this foolish Negative Feed Back and Here's why:  Most new Players find it very difficult to play this game because it's not easy to play, It's challenging, most players want a simple and Easy MMO And if that's the case then this MMO RPG is NOT for you.  Alot of Players find it hard to gain chips, if your serouis about this game and actually take the time to explore the massive gameworld and see what's worth what, gaining chips is relativly easy easy for new players.  The crafting system is one of the best I've seen in an MMORPG making it time consuming to figure out where to find certain matierals or if you have the chips just buy them off the auction if you have the chips to, and if there's any on the Auction. (Most players think this is stupid and QQ about it, This MMO RPG is not for you then.)  PvP is Unfair? Doubtful, you just need to know how to create a proper PvP build not just slap your AP points in whatever you think is best, they do make Fallen Earth Character Planners which you can access online by just punching it into google search. The thing with PvP is most players now are experinced Veterens playing, making it more challenging for newer players that hit higher levels to PvP, which is where Clans come into Play. Once you find a clan It's not so hard learning the ropes of PvP, however it is still a steep learning Curve.  Everythings to Expensive. Well heres the thing about that. It's the Apocalypse, Nothings going to be cheap especially not Vehicles, your lucky to even aquire one, most players think this is stupid However it's not. It's challenging just the way a game like this was Met to be.  Staff are useless GM's are bad? Doubtful, out of the few thousand players that play Fallen Earth theres only a Few GM's online so you need to stop and think you have other players PMing them at once to, they can't drop everything just to Help you. Your no Special then everyone else, The GMs/Staff are very Helpful once they actually get around to Responding to you, If you think there's only 2 or sometimes 3 GM's on at a time. A few Thousand Players.. Don't have high hopes of getting a responce. Your better off Submiting a Support Ticket @  Gamersfirst.com  rather then comming here and QQing about it because you think your special.  Now my Plus's about the game:  The game engine may be old but no one has yet to make a better MMO RPG, most game reviewers look at a game by graphics and gameplay, If it has bad graphics it automically get's a bad Review just because. That's now a game Reviewer at all but more of a Person that has to diss a game because it's not to there likings and specifications, It's probably better then what you could ever create to, so my question. What gives you the right to judge a game by graphics when you probably don't know a thing about game creating and how much effort and time and hours go into it? You don't. Peroid.  The game is hardly buggy at all. Theres the occasional the ground is invisible but that's a 3% chance of happening to you and even so it's an easy fix, Disable Post FX/Adv Post FX and it's fixxed, re enable it next game launch and it's fixxed.  Again it's an old game engine and it's very good considering how much detaiil is in each area, even players with Windows XP can play it without an issue.  I highly recommend this game to anyone that likes challenging and fun MMO RPGs. Then this game is for YOU.  Overall this is a one of a kind game and everything about it is truly Unique.  9/10 
276	1	a	Really great game it's like a MMO of GTA where u can rank up costumize ur char,Clothing,Car everything truly recommend it to other people. And it's free to play!
2596	1	a	It's a bit laggy but its fun. 
5072	0	a	i tryed to play it i was exited but it took three days you instal  PLUS IT DOESNT WORK  Ok so it finnally got working BUT!!  Kick By Piggy â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ because i  dont have a1373c2.345  i do not request this game and i  find it a waste of time!
6053	0	a	my poops look better than this game...
10248	1	a	its REALLY. i mean REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEALLY laggy close to the start of the game. im not going to give any spoilers but close to where u meet the first people that tha help u. im talk extremly laggy. but mabey it can be fixed in the otions, how knows, but i sorda like the idea of the game
10538	0	a	Rip Wildshadow. Rip my chars. Rip obamacare. Rip my fun
9332	0	a	Hey lets put a help chat where the MOD's totally block everything you say bad about the game....played it for 45 min and they didn't allow anyone to say anything bad about the game.....let's just put it out there. It's not arcade like, mods black your chat espcially if you say something that insn't working. Stay away from the game if you can they don't want to hear the truth...The truth is this: they made a game that doesn't allow you to tell them whats wrong with it, the controls are not working, middle mouse button to switch from clicking to moving doesn't work....stay away from this game....
3152	1	a	Improved from original, people are actually playing it. Fun, however this game is a major â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ magnet. Play, don't give a damn, and you'll have a blast. Outside of the lag spikes on both east and west coast servers...a worthwhile venture into MMO 'Cops &amp; Robbers'..
1842	1	a	a lot of lag, but a great game~
2738	1	a	I like this game alot.
8797	0	a	This game is pretty bad..!   Matchmaking almost none existant. Open Mics HUD / UI is bad not player friendly. For 16 years old and under ! The cummunity is horrible everyong just trash talks everyone.. Pay to Win --  The only good thing is rich customization of a charecter/Items.  Industrial/Cyberpunk Style game!
1676	1	a	I don't remember buying or playing this game. I don't know how it ended up on my Steam Account â it doesn't ring a bell at all! I have purchased far too many games on Steam and this is what happens when you do! Despite having no memory of it, I'll surmise it's a really great game. It might possibly be, the best fun I cannot remember having! Could it even be possible, that I've also played it more than Killing Floor?
6019	0	a	This game basically needs a bit of cash splashed onto it to work. its a good f2p game but, you need to pay money to get good guns to do good. using the in-game currency to buy perma-guns would be nice. This game handles itself strangely. pay like 35 in-game credits for a permanant clothing item but pay 1300 credits for a leased gun. The artwork that people post for this game looks nice.  A remake (or sequel) would be nice (if there was no need to pay real money). Hit detection can be S.H.I.T but if you pay like 100 usd to buy a SINGLE permanent gun you won't have a problem. And as RELOADED ENT. are money â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s they sell in THE CASH SHOP leased guns. LIKE WTF. don't play until it gets made better.
3917	0	a	The game itself is alright, the customization is great. Everything else sucks..to simply to put it.  Terrible community but an even worse support. They spend more time on trying to make a fast buck over helping players who were falsely banned. Whether you pay or not you're on their ignore list. If you try posting on the G1 forums they'll lock the thread and tell you to submit a support ticket, and if you submit a ticket, you'll get an automated-response that doesn't help you at all. The matchmaking is unbalanced, 9/10 times I get opposition that suck so bad they accuse me of hacking, apparently that isn't better than you will call you a hacker. There's a handful of exploits that people take advantage of. People will grief you constantly. There's only 4 maps total, 2 of them are pretty much just deathmatches. It's not pay2win but it the weapons are significantly better so in the right hands they can make a person unstoppable. There's a variety of missions but more or less repetitive. Enforcers get stun guns which can become very annoying very quickly, marketplace items are beyond overpriced. If you have no friends to play with in this game, it can really disappoint. Every so often you'll also come across hackers.  OVERALL  Game: 7/10 Community: 4/10 Support: 0/10  Total: 11/30  In other words, don't waste your time on a game that won't waste its time on you.
5953	0	a	my friging computer does not run it
5307	0	a	This is one classic EPIC Pay2Win game with crazy laggy server. If you want to get a nice stroke during playing with your PC, this game is definitly your first choice.
5014	0	a	Pay to win.
3681	1	a	5/5 would flip my 4x4 vegas again
10016	1	a	Basically fallout for poor people
2351	1	a	wow much shooter
749	1	a	I love this game! It is very addictive, all the customization you could want. The match making is the only thing that I dont always like about this game.
4598	0	a	Gameplay is pretty linear and there is more fun to be held in customising than actual combat, which is mostly dominated by hackers which dont seem to get banned.
1372	1	a	it's fun try itr out
9486	0	a	it necer signs me in even if i use my steam
9193	1	a	The things i liked : 1. crafting 2. survival 3. Massive Multiplayer 4.you can create almost anything ;)  The things i didn't liked :  1. you can have a little money problem in game ... but don't worry you will get some soon :D .    DOWNLOAD NOW!!!! :D and add me if you downloaded this i can help you ;)
2711	1	a	I accidently left this running for like 2 days, but I played a good hour and made Paul Sr. from American Chopper. 10/10 IGN 
10509	0	a	I played the browser version of this a lot. It was plenty fun, grinding pots with friends, maxing a char, dying, crying, vowing not to be overconfident again, then repeat. It would still be fun right now if Kabam actually puts their effort into balancing the classes and dungeons and all that, but noooo they only care about their sweet money. We haven't seen an update for months, and the game is overrun by hackers and bots. I wish I can see your glorious days again, my dear RotMG..
10450	0	a	You Can't Even Log In To The Game For The First Time.. How Could You Play??  -11/10 â¥â¥â¥â¥er
5929	0	a	played this game for a short while was not impressed at all, lame in game physics crappy car control even worse char control  missions consist of shoot other players...... (which other players will undoubtly own you as they are completely unbalanced matches) out of missions gameplay consists of do even more lame stuff to earn cash to get items   has potential but dont download unless your so incrediably board   also its data hog burns data constantly wheather you standing still or doing stuff  in less than an hour it used over 50 megs  in just over an hour used over 100 megs
5345	0	a	pay 2 win but its fun somtimes unless the people you verse have there moms credit cards as weapons
2416	1	a	Such a great game, play it, I recomend it!
2472	1	a	Not as much as a Pay2Win as most of the other Free to plays but paying players will always be noticable. Gameplay can get a little confusing and frustrating with the lack of instruction. My biggest issue is that this game is a UI NIGHTMARE. I still have not yet figured out how to customize cars and characters. Firing weapons on full auto just makes the spread continuously grow and does not slow/stop between shots unless you lay off the trigger. Every car that is customized by the player lacks responsive steering severely but will improve when giving gas through corners, kind of like a reverse GTA4 handling (Cars in GTA4 are responsive but handle like garbage). I don't feel like I would recommend it but it does not deserve a not recommend.
9600	0	a	- It takes too much time to master the controls - The quests are boring - The controls are quite complex and should be simplified - Its difficult to navigate to the easier areas of the map - You'll probally never get a horse  - Its fun to play for the first 5 hours
10737	1	a	pretty boring 8bit style MMO Bullet Hell RPG. Suffered a bit of a breach where a hacker got in.  Game gets pretty boring after dying the eighth time and having to level up.
6179	0	a	if u r not from usa then this game is a Sh it for ur country... awful lag... u wanna shoot someone? GUESS WHAT? U r already dead! my internet speed its not bad... i have played plenty of other games... where the lag wasnt an issue...
5740	0	a	Graphics no you get items like n warface no login no dont get it
7750	0	a	Well, after playing this game for a short amount of time, and I know you will say you haven't played that long, but it is very poorly put together, and not enough time was put into missions. They get extremely boring and it is very difficult to gain money. The money isn't the issue though, it's the ranking system. It does take some time to get used to, and it is not confusing, although it is time consuming. The marketing is not well put together as well. Very inconvinient. The driving mechanics as well as the shooting mechanics aren't the greatest either. Driving is very delayed when you want to turn, and shooting is very inaccurate due to large crosshairs, even when you aim in. All and all, I'd give this game a 6/10, mainly because of the graphics being so good for a free to play game and the idea. GamersFirst definetly have something started. They just need to finish it..
4804	0	a	This game is fun.   I am also a compulsive liar.
3297	1	a	wher do you find the grage 
1764	1	a	great for when you want a cause of suicide!
8131	0	a	the game is really fun but its ruined by how badly they want you to spend real money on the game. in order to get anything decent or cool you need to pay money for god damn points. you can only have 2 decals on your car if u want more u need to pay. character stuff u need to pay. f that. basically this game should be called money waster simulator. if they get rid of the money and make a way to get those stuff then 8/10.
7116	0	a	Good game a realy good game. But this is more like log in simulator.   1/10
4440	0	a	OMG THIS GAME IS THE BOMBA I JUMPED OVER THE BORDER,AND TRIED IT WITH AN STOOL,SO YAH XxLOLZORXx
1459	1	a	I've played this game so many hours (mostly before i have been released on steam). I have spent so many hours in the social district to create and design my own clothes and cars. To sell them for a good amount of ingame money.  But also the multiplayer experience is fun.  It brings some issues with it but i think it is still enjoyable.  Pros:  -open world -fully customizable cars and clothes -quick missions with a lot of action -aimbased shooter -a quiet nice community  Contras: -a lot of hackers -sometimes laggy -update dates takes too long
7836	0	a	it's not really working for me 
829	1	a	hell yea best game ever
2048	1	a	its cool but not that cool 
6222	0	a	This game is way too confusing. The hud is useless and overpacked. The maps are really small when compared to gta and such like. The posse system is really stupid and the fact that you cannot spot crimes in progress sucks. (There is a button to press like f4 or something, but that is glitched to â¥â¥â¥â¥). What else... Oh yeah, the community can be unfriendly. Thats the kicker. So I cannot say this game is fun, or I would be lying. Play something else, don't spend money on this game.
5082	0	a	Required me to like a Facebook page to play. Literally cancer.
10408	1	a	There is MUCH potential to where this could head to. I see it happening as well.. Deserves for you gamers to give it a try for sure!
398	1	a	this is one fun game it is like gta but an mmo or you could say it is like saints row with more people i love this game and it is free to play so go check it out 
1297	1	a	10/10
10392	1	a	Ok this is a good game by the looks its like fallout just with worst grafics and difrent stroy. WARNING: Theres alout of downloading! I really think I should of got this when it came out. Peace.
10892	1	a	I recomend this game. For some reason when you first start out you go into a relam and then you like just want to keep playing. t means what kind of teir it is. If you find a tier 4,5,or 6 do not give it away. you can only find those in very rare places. If you are a noob at this game and someone tries to offer you something by doing a trade for actual money just thats problay not even worth it no matter what it is just ignore it otherwise you are a idiot. I highly recomend this game though.
597	1	a	I know I put recommended, but it's only really because the game is free. It is extremely pay to play/win, but there is decent gear you can get for free. I did on the whole enjoy my time playing, but when the enemies had OP â¥â¥â¥â¥, it was EXTREMELY annoying. If you dont mind it taking quite a while to get good â¥â¥â¥â¥, and/or spending a few bucks, its great, otherwise, play a different game.
8857	1	a	I think this game will appeal to you if you are a certain kind of person. Do you like Firefly or Mad Max? Does the post disaster/apocalyptic setting appeal? Do you like melancholy, moody music? Do you tend to like more serious 'grown up' games that allow true role playing? Are you happy to wander around on your own, sometimes for long stretches of time, without seeing a soul? Are you more of a loner (a strange question for an MMO perhaps)? Are you more of a calm person who takes gaming slowly rather than rushing to experience a game in the shortest possible time? If the answer is mostly yes this game could be for you...  For me, the atmosphere in this game is second to none. Fantastic music, incredible view distance that really hammers home the immense size of the game (around 1000 square kilometres I believe - to put that into perspective Skyrim is around 40 I think) and true freedom to go pretty much wherever you want right from the very start of the game. Note though that I play as a single player - I'm not a clan type of person - so I can't really tell you much about the social side of the game. It is fairly quiet of late - not too many players - but that suits me fine.  It's certainly not a polished experience but then, if you're anything like me, that won't matter in the slightest. There's plenty of minor bugs although hardly any will stop progress (a simple relog usually sorts out most things) and there are plenty of minor gameplay things to moan about but, overall, the game is very unique and well worth the download. A huge thing in its favour is that it's a true free to play game. You can play the entire game without spending any real world money. Real world money will get you cool items to wear, cool vehicles, nice buffs and such but almost all of it can also be purchased with in game earned currency if you are patient and keep an eye on the auction house for bargains. It's also worth noting that a lot of the coolest, unique weapons and clothing items can only be earned through questing.  I'm not going to go too heavily into the mechanics of the game - it's pretty standard MMO levelling and crafting (but a very deep and rewarding crafting system) and such but it is one of the very few MMO's with real time skill based combat - think first person shooter - and the whole experience of the game is very 'manual' - nothing's on auto pilot - it's all on you to use your skill to stay alive basically.  Right, I think I've talked enough now...
8200	0	a	its a great game but its frickin pay to win every team i go against im sniped by a gold weapon which has perfect stats so either nerf these weapons or make them rewards because im sick of it. DONT PLAY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU HAVE MONEY  
10903	1	a	Lots of fun...until you run out of classes to unlock
5846	0	a	Its just not fun for poor people. If you\'re rich af, try this, but people who dont want to spend much beware of this game. It will try to suck you dry of your money, because anything good in this game requires real money.
4049	0	a	This game is premium grade-A sh!te. I made a character and was pretty much thrown into a world similar to the outraged chaos in GTA Online with no idea about where I was even supposed to begin. After hours of losing missions constantly to the criminals I decided to make one. I actually took my time with this character to make sure they looked exactly how I wanted them to, and when I went to create the character I was told I was disconnected from the server for an unknown reason and lost all of my progress. This game was a big waste of time, and I would not recommend it to the ones I care about.

10087	1	a	my first game, it was fun than got old
5920	0	a	Don't bother with this game.  There may have been a time when this was a fun title back when it first came out. That ship has sadly set sail unfortunately.  Having played this game both before and after it hit steam, it hasn't made enough changes to the formula to really be worth your time unless you are looking for excuses to break your keyboard/PC in a fit of rage.  The teams for missions/combat are hopelessly unbalanced 4 times out of 5. With rookies/new players often taking up 3 of the 4 players while the other team is full of players with 800+ hours whom know every in and out of the maps. Whom have the best gear and customized vehicles and clothes money can buy (both with in game currency and microtransactions).  The vehicles handle like garbage. If you have even the slightest lag whilst playing this game may god have mercy on your car's steering, the game will not.  The ONLY reason I would suggest even remotely looking at this game is for it's customization. I have never seen a game that lets you get so detailed with everything from each article of clothing, to the decals on your car to even the soundtrack that plays for someone when you kill them.  -pi/10, would rather get in a fist-fight with pack of half-starved hyenas

8669	0	a	Pay2win, car controls are garbage, extremely CPU and Memory intensive for very poor graphic quality. Enforcer criminal catching functionality is extremely unrewarding and labour intensive.
3608	1	a	A funny game, you can rage a lot on it but very pleasant, a lot of hackers but not every hackers are pretty cheat, some hackers are pretty bad and you can destroy them easily, some people will tell you that the game is a pay to win but it isn't a real one, if you don't want to pay, you aren't obligate, you can have everything for free but it takes a long time playing and if you're impatient, I hope that your credit card is full ^^
9225	0	a	liek skyrim but with guns

2446	1	a	This is game is a pretty good game but they could make changes to make it better.   -The responding time when you're driving is not fast enough -Hackers are starting to dominate the game -Broken spawn points -Skin texture issues when you load up -Can be boring sometimes, repetive missions  -Finding a mission takes a while because barely anyone plays this anymore -They should add bikes  -The Asylum thing has not been open for a while, that game mode made the game really intense and exciting -Laggy as hell  I stopped playing this game because it became really dull and worthless but if you like free roam,action games then try this game out.
8084	0	a	This game sucks, it crashes every 5 minutes and I never even got the email to verify my account, i want the 4 hours of my life back that this game took away.
7708	0	a	Went and played this game for 20 minutes, lags like sh*t and gives me a punkbuster kick within 5 minutes. -&gt; DELETE
8151	0	a	Game controls are Saints Row II awkward, and community is full of bitter people. Not trolls trying to be funny, just bitter people.
3720	1	a	Ok so I have been kind of addicted to this game for over a year now. Its my first venture into a true PVP game. The community is ok once you find other players willing to help teach you the game and play along your side until you get the mechanics figured out. The match making is pretty bad and there are alot of people who play in zones where they don't belong (you will have issues with getting killed alot and not getting many kills when you start) out once you figure it out and you keep in the back of your mind that this is only a game and you don't rage quit it turns out to be pretty good.
7363	0	a	this is a good game which reminds me of the game gta . it is good but u will need to spend real mony to get permanent stuff. so i dont recommend this game at all. 
3549	1	a	As you can see, i am an Argonian, And i require a certain... Type of game, And this game is perfect for me and my reptilian Brethren 10/10 Would Play Again
3841	0	a	I really can't believe I tortured myself with this game for so long.  I immediately fell in love with the idea of the game. Who among us, who grew up in the GTA generation, could refuse a massively multiplayer simulacron? A game where you could run rampant in a bustling city, breaking the law or thwarting lawbreakers. A game where you could make your own theme music, graffiti and design your cars and clothes. A game with a thriving community-driven marketplace.  It wasn't hard to crush those dreams, as the current developers and community have done. The game makes you hate each other. It makes you hate the people hosting and developing it. Matchmaking forces you to discriminate against weaker players being on your squad. Mission types devolve into hateful grudge matches that will make you twitch, sweat, and curse. The low population and broken ranking system will ensure that certain notorious individuals will become your personal arch nemeses. The laughable price point at which gear is pushed by the marketting department will have you cringing. The way in-game money makes people insane will have you questioning your own friends' intentions and paranoia will haunt your every financial decision. The balancing of weapons, and the steep skill landscape will ensure that every now and then your weapon, no matter how spectacular or expensive, will feel like a capgun or limp noodle in your hand.  It took me far too long to realize I wasn't even enjoying myself. I hope this, and other reviews like it, may yet spare someone of the same experience. Oh yes, my love and I spent well into a hundred or so dollars each on this game. It's definitely not even worth trying as a free-to-player. You're severely limitted in every aspect of gameplay unless you're a premium account holder.
8505	0	a	Pay 2 win game, better save the money and buy GTA V.
2261	1	a	Hello,this game is awesome,the customization is epic,it's like an gta 5 for free ;D
5531	0	a	Bad game. Not worth any money.
2485	1	a	Best free to play shooter
8791	0	a	I can't say I actually would recommend this game. That doesn't mean it's not a fun game some of the time, but usally it's honestly pretty bad. You'll get lucky if you find some people who aren't hacking, scum bag trolls or self-procalimed 'pro-players.' The people you'll typically run into are your average scum bags who will constantly tell you how bad you are and that you suck and blah blah blah even though they can't seem to win the match either. BUT when you do find some good people and get in a group, the game can be pretty fun. The customization is very good too, plus there should be an game engine update sometime in 2016 as well.   Edit: Yeah that engine update still hasn't happened.
9550	0	a	Can't even play the game, too many issues with updating; It keeps reinstalling the same update over and over again so actually launching the game from steam is impossible.
1759	1	a	A decent game imo to have fun with your friends :), try it out and see!.
3116	1	a	Good game not as good as a GTA but i still give it a thumbs up but the only problem is the 30 mins it takes to load it.
3678	1	a	I haven't played this game enough to rate it. But i can tell that the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s, and weapons in this game are making it awesome! The only bad thing about this game is the community, 50% are hacking russian â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥. But i enjoyed myself. 9/10
8513	0	a	One of the worst games ive ever played

2396	1	a	It's good dumb fun. The matchmaking tries its hardest to put you against people your skill level, so don't fret if you're terrible, you'll be put against those who are as well. :)  It's a decent game, I'd suggest it to those who want to goof around and customize their character to all hell.  Wish it had a decent roleplay community, sadly.. no.
9960	0	a	Ok sooooo, I installed went to play and it asks you to create an account. No problem lets do that. Wait, it is saying I already have  1......what?  I have never played this so how do I......ok let me attempt guessing it. Nope, not happening, so I try doing a password reset. IT WORKED, maybe now I can â¥â¥â¥â¥ing play this game already. But wait.....what is my username associated to that password? I try everything I could think of, Steam name, E-mail and random usernames I usually use. Nope, nothing, nada, zip, zilch. I give up â¥â¥â¥â¥ THIS GAME, UNINSTALLED. You know you have wasted your time installing when the game doesn't even want you to play it.

7390	0	a	This game sucks. The only way to get anywhere is to pay money for premuim. there is also to many hackers.
10690	1	a	This game has a long and fabled history.  It began as an indie game concieved by the lengendary wildshadow studios.  It was brought by a big AAA company, Kabam.  And now it lies in the hand of yet another indie game company, Deca games.  This game is suprisingly amazing. A simple concept, flawlessly executed, for near-perfection. It's been a pay-to-win game in it's Kabam era, but in the Deca games era, I hope it will return to pay for convience. The lack of friends playing this game, and it's aforementioned monetary supplication system are what made me stop playing it, but it's a great game to waste hours in.  The interesting combination of genres lends to it's replayablity, and honestly it's what's kept me coming back to it, time and time again.  I would reccommend playing it in between more serious games. :)
9419	0	a	This game is Terrible even for a free to play game. you have waaaaaaaay to many screens open while you play so u can never see where the ememies are you also are forced to switch weapons using Ctrl plus the moouse wheel witch only works about 20% of the time and on top of all of that if an enemy is chasing you theres no escaping, the can literaly hit you with a shank for like 12 feet away and i have to be at makeout distince to even hit him with my pistol, all together this is probably the worst game ive ever played in my life
10532	0	a	I have 400 hours on the browser version as well. fk kabam and pets gg wp
8113	0	a	WAAAAY back in the day I was picked to alpha test this game. The entire community of testers told the Devs time and again that they needed to add things to APB other than pure PvP for the game to work. Unfortunately, they never listened to their potential customers, the game did terribly, and the original devs ended up closing shop because of it! Now that it's been out for a while on the F2P market I figured I would give it a try, to see if the game has matured into something other than what it used to be. Sadly, nothing has been changed. The same glitches are in the game, and even with a &lt;60 ping latency the server still bugs out when there's a lot of people in one place.   If all you're interested in is running and gunning against other players then have at it, otherwise I would recommend other games like The Secret World that are on the F2P market.
9231	1	a	If you do not receive an e-mail within 5-10 minutes, please try registering your account again.  ... F*cking registering 50 times again and again.  10/10 would lose 1 hour again.  I recomend this game :/ 
1475	1	a	APB Reloaded. You could compare it too Grand Theft Auto online. There are 2 groups, Enforcers and Criminals. They both have their strong and weak points. Personally I find Enforcers easier to level up, but Criminals are easier to get money with. You can buy weapons, clothes, songs (for your player) and cars. All of those are also completely customizable! Just a car with 1 color? Fine! A car with 5 colors and 20 cool art things on it? Fine! Everything is possible. You can even design your own logo's, which is awesome! Everyone does that and you can see a lot of creative people. There are some logo's that are intimidating, but you'll just have to deal with it.  There is an option to buy items with in-game money or with real money, via the store. Both are great ways to get better items.  Most of the features in the game are good, still there are some bad ones. There are for example quite some hackers, really frustrating and the staff doesn't do anything about that, or at least, not much. There are also some really overpowered weapons, like the OSMAW, a Rocketlauncher that kind of insta-kills you, really no-skilled. Luckily it's a main weapon, so you will have to exchange it for an assault rifle and the launcher is empty quick.  Missions are fun, randomly getting people from the other faction against you. It's actually a simple attack/defend mission, most of the time. Sometimes there are 'capture the flag'-missions, 'dominion'-missions and simple 'team-deathmatch'-missions. Sometimes the matchmaking isn't as equal is people would like to though.  I recommend everyone to play it. It is awesome, fun and challenging. Beware, you do need a computer with some good hardware, if you do not have that, you will have problems running it. Just install the game on Steam, it's free-to-play and the game isn't that big to download. If you like shooters, racing and an open-world game, this is for you.   Rating: 7.5/10 Not a 7, because that's too low, not an 8 because it's not good enough for that. Still worth a try
1282	1	a	Very fun game, loads of customization towards your character, cars, guns, and gear. Its open-world and the civilian physics is hilarous. Sometimes I play just to hit people as a criminal. For a F2P, its very good.
10718	1	a	Great game to try for fun. I love the 'you only live once' style games, and the fact that this is an MMO makes it all the more epic! Can you beat the boss and laugh as the noobs around you die? Or will you join their pile of corpses? Haha fear not, you can save most valuable items in your 'vault' and those items carry over from character to character. Once you become hardcore though, you will invest heavily into the stat lines of your main characters maxing out their stats so they are tougher, and fight a lot better.
257	1	a	Not bad, have to have a pretty good pc to play it though!
3035	1	a	Quick fun gameplay, right from the begin!
7281	0	a	This was one of ma first games on the computer and its brand new and it lagged a â¥â¥â¥â¥ ton
5192	0	a	I have played APB for a short time, when I first started playing I got gold my first day, I was having fun, but as soon as you hit high ranked servers, you're dead, the game is no longer fun because you can't kill cheaters, or people who are just too good at the game and should stop playing it.   APB's Customization is the best customization I have ever seen in any game, you can design your car the way you want to, you can put anything on it and it's completely up to you. The character customization is also great, I managed to make my character look exactly like Rambo and had a blast doing it.  APB's Gameplay however is not the worst, and not the best I have seen in a game. It seems they have worked more on the things that don't matter as much as they have on things that do. Certain guns need to not be implemented in the game, I enter a gold server, I always get matched with someone that has a rocket launcher and just uses it the entire match, how many rockets does that dang thing have with ammo? If it stays implemented, you should only get 1 rocket per life, you know how much those things weigh? And why is everything that is completely OP only available to higher ranked players? I'm gold with a Shaw with no Mods on it, and they are gold with ANY GUN THEIR HEART DESIRES WITH MAXED MODS ON IT. And you just can't win, somehow they beat an LMG (Shaw) with a pistol. I don't get it, there are no bullet physics in the game, headshots do not matter, the only skill required is to be a troll and lean back and forth behind a wall until you kill someone.  I loved the game at first, but I have learned to hate the game. I have literally played the game for 5 days now and went from loving it to hating it. APB, if you want more players, change. Change what the community wants you to change.  Will NOT play again. 3/10

It is soooo much fun probally increibly boring without freinds i always played with freinds and it was so much fun the car meachnics are great the cutomisation is great the gunplay is great the missons are ok not bad but ok and it runs pretty smooth considering i only have a gt 630 graphics card an i6 prosesser and 4 gigs of ram :D
7248	0	a	I like this game quite a lot, which is why I have 258.4 hours in it, but I can't recommend it becuase it uses the worst anti cheat known to man. We mortals merely call it 'punkbuster' this god awful invention is believed to date back to Soviet times where Soviet scientists were thinking what the best way to ruin the western games market was. They decided that the absolutely best way was to make a anti-cheat so horrible that it kicks random people off server, aswell as scan your files when you are not even on the game. So in summary great game but uses anti-cheat developed by the soviets to troll gamers.
4717	0	a	Character Customisation = Dank Uninstall Button = Dank
5038	0	a	No Australian servers so the latency is just awful and in most cases unplayable, it was originally disigned by Realtime Worlds but they sold the half finished piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ to the K2 network for 2 million dollars... not that the game wouldn't be fun and enjoyable but it is still quite bad, on the plus side the character customization is insane, much like The Sims only without the clothes option. I honestly don't know why they can't just get off their lazy asses and get some Australian servers?
6005	0	a	its unoptimized, i cant even get it to load play a better mmo
9461	1	a	I was almost addicted to this game! There is such a vast world! I love it!
2059	1	a	Weird, buggy, can be fun at times, but again, like alot of games like this, you get alil outclassed by those players who play all the time.   give it a try, still a fun game, I personally just don't think it's a game that your gonna play all the time.
7852	0	a	Dont let the 35 hours fool you, I've been playing for some time long before the game has been out on steam.  Probably the greatest character customization I've seen to this date, players progressively unlock premade designs or simple shapes they use to design their own, it all depends on a players imagination on how much or what their character is wearing, along with how it all looks on them, the same goes for vehicles.  Weapon and vehicle viriety isn't all that bad, you're given some basic weapons and can later aquire some with mods and some with open slots for mods which have their own ups and downs; But weapons that players can pay real money for arent available to other players; some which, while not completely better than others, the situation they cover are more common than not, You're given a small Sadan but later on you can aquire different, faster, stronger, higher storage capacity cars and some for up to 4 people can shoot out of while on the move.  Player base wise, the game seems to consist of nothing but GIFTs, short for Greater Internet â¥â¥â¥â¥wad Theory, in which a Normal Person + Anonymity + Audience = Total â¥â¥â¥â¥wad, expect to get a bunch of vile /whispers because someone that cant aim for â¥â¥â¥â¥ misses point blank with a high power sniper rifle with a slow rate of fire and you can nicely ventilate them with an automatic assault shotgun.  Driving in the game is rather floaty and awkward there is tad of a delay between the command and the vehicle doing the action. Guns have great sound but shooting pretty much forces players to aim down sights or in this game 'marksmanship mode' even in small street alleys at all times unless its an smg or some pistols, Time to kill in the game feels rather quick, dying between two or five hits depending if the weapon is a powerful hitter or a bullet hose, that along with the lack luster accuracy even in marksmanship mode means players wil spray entire magazines into each other until someone dies and getting a nice little whisper from the other player that you're a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ or a hacker.  Finally the game has a sadly pants-on-head â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ way of choosing which server or 'district' you're forced to enter and who your enemies and allies are. A players Rank increases constantly, this would be your constantly progressing level and your Threat Level is how challenging the game perceives you, devided into Green, Bronze, Silver and Lastly Gold. the latter is sadly what the game keeps in mind about a player, districts are mainly devided by your Threat Level, so imagine a Golden Threat Rank 25 up against a Golden Threat Rank 150.   The game has a nice soundtrack, you can even play music from your MP3 library in the game if you wish, and players with that song can also hear it playing, you can also make a nice little 8-16 bit tune that will play for the player you've killed and play at the end of a round if you're the MVP.  All in all, if the game wasn't chock full of immature â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s, guns that aren't accurate unless you're using the one sniper rifle available in marksmanship mode, crouched and still and player characters that die in 2-5 shots with no headshots to count I'd still play it.

8643	0	a	Never in my life have thought that potential is the only good aspect of a game. The environment is toxic, not so much the people but due the fact that after 3 years of playing I've determined that this is not a 3de person shooter but competitive credit card swiping or job creation for your friendly neighborhood hacker. In essence this game is only fun after a patch for the first 10 or so hours.

4647	0	a	Nice idea totally broken by a horrible matchmaking, which ends making matches between fresh new players that are learning how to play with endgame players (makes totally no sense). Also, as usual in every 'Free To Play Games' theres a 'Pay To Win Option' that makes you premium and get the good weapons to win all matches easily.  Most weapons AREN'T permanent, they last around 10 days max. The game constantly lag's out, and bugs are frequent. Specially when you're shooting.  The protection against hackers is horrible, as I have seen people using Pistols from long range like if they were using a sniper (reminding that theres not a zoom option, or a very very poor one), I've also seen people using Heavy Rifles with the accuracy of a sniper, which is highly improbable.  Do not recommend, waste your time elsewhere :)

4726	0	a	Fairly depressing Has a lot of lag for the mode it's meant to be played in  Uninteresting visual style, art design, lack of variety. There are many other, better oprions if u want to play a mmo similar to this one 
8683	0	a	â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game, so many guns are broken etc.
8122	0	a	In this game you will only meet kids who spend their money for stupid things...  This game is full of guys with OP guns...You cant do nothing to them...You must atleast empty up to 3-4 magazines to kill them while they kill you in 2-3 hits...  Game was great at the beginning but later it really becomes unplayable.. The only good thing is Character/Symbol Creator and nothing else... I dont recommend this game cuz it sucks...  0/10 Not worth installing...
4666	0	a	very bad at times pay to win new people are against experienced people and some missions they know where you are with a tracking sign so you can not sneak up on them
747	1	a	This Game Just Like Gta 5 And Saint Row Put Together. Its A Awsome Game I Love This Game. If U Can Buy Houses And Stay In Them This Game Will Be the best out of all them. But U Can Do Soo Much In This Game And It Free
8543	0	a	The worst optimization I've ever seen. (Maybe Saints Row 2 matches this game). It's ok when you walk but when you're driving, it's a nightmare... And also driving model is very uncomfortable.
3671	1	a	This game has lots of issues, like cheaters, buy to win, timed weapons ( huge BS but it's true), limited world, boring as hell missions (they seem to be different, but they are all the same, just team deathmatch) maps are also boring as hell, those towns are boring as hell, ..... there are some many disadvantages .... , but there are few things that makes this game interesting .... for a while, character creator, clothes creator (not pure, but you can make realy good costume for your character) and that would be all. It's not that bad for a free game, but definitely not worth spending any money for premium or for (give me a break) timed weapons.
4406	0	a	APB reloaded downloads a launcher/downloader, rather than the game straight from steam. Not entirely damning, fairly common with larger MMOs such as WOT, WT, and Planetside 2.  The updates are fairly large and download slowly When you press the 'Start' button the first time, a new tab opens in your default browser that leads you to a page where you can 'Like' APB's facebook page. This cannot be disabled. It is stupid. So very, very, very stupid. No, I will not like this abomination's facebook page before I've even played the game, no matter how many times you open a new tab for me to do so. This also can cause active process issues and delay you. When I pressed start a SECOND TIME, the game attempted to launch. Apparently Nvidia PhysX is mandatory, because the game notes that it cannot access PhysX, and fails to start. (Read, screw you AMD users) I've seen games where PhysX can be enabled in the settings, never one where it's mandatory, and with good reason. Next it noted that it apparently could not access the registry keys it supposedly installed. Something that should not happen with a Steam Regulated install. This game is buggy as hell, poorly designed, and it seems their staff are doing absolutely nothing but creating an endless stream of overpriced overpowered novelty guns to try and sell you simply so you can remain competitive. 0/10 gr8 b8 m8
6557	0	a	This is the worst first person shooter i've ever played. The maps suck, it's way too big and open for only 1 person(me). The servers are never up, and the gameplay is choppy and there isn't even any guns in the game. The weapon choice is absolutely terrible and graphics are bad. Infinity ward and Apple really messed up on this game.
7099	0	a	Played a long time before it hit steam, before it hit the wreck of a company called gamersfirst. If you see a game run by gamersfirst just know their real name is gamerslast.
5272	0	a	Words can not describe how â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game is. Actually they can:   - horrible netcode - horrible engine - massively P2W, like it is a joke how they jew money out of people - hackers - non-existing matchmaking - real fu.king retar.ed community  Utter trash, don't even bother downloading. Potatoe / 10
7552	0	a	So let's get this rolling.  This game is addictive as â¥â¥â¥â¥ due to being just so much fun at the lower levels but when you progress your threat changes and you will be placed with much harder opponents. The problem is there is no required level for this threat, meaning low level players can reach the highest threat level and then they are for the most part â¥â¥â¥â¥ed. You face enemies that have so much stuff or spend real money on the game that you just get face rolled.   Which doesn't help the match making, that's broken as â¥â¥â¥â¥. At late game you get placed into such unfair matches that it releases the devil inside you. Placing you in games with unbalanced amount of players or threat level. We were two silver threat levels playing against 2 highest level gold threat players and being facerolled.  Then there is the problem of Pay 2 Win. This game has the most OP Pay to win system I have ever seen. You can buy the max level guns and items at any level, meaning you get players just owning you at lower threats and levels. These guns can be obtained (Sort of) at the highest level but just think for a moment, low level players with end game guns....  Now for servers. The servers are for the most part fine, the problem is the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing way the game uses the servers. Almost everything is server side, so lag? Tough â¥â¥â¥â¥. You're going to crash and backtrack the whole time, also the server side thing doesn't work for international players as they have delayed â¥â¥â¥â¥ing everything. Delayed controls on vehicles, delayed hit detection, delayed death and damage. Making the game feel like a piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥.  The Weapons in the game are for the most part good except for the OP Premium guns that are sold on the market. The guns expire every 10 days and they don't cost a high amount but the problem is that the Guns you pay â¥â¥â¥â¥ing money for also expire, although the period is 30 days instead of 10. So when you come back after taking a break from the game, you'll find out that you have no weapons and have thrown more money at the game to unlock those weapons that are required to even win matches.  The game's customization is simply amazing, the company that owns the game host events for artists to create new works of art for the game and if they win they get allowed to sell it on the premium store, but the problem here is you have to pay to be able to make anything. That's right, you have to pay for fonts, icons, decals and much more to be able to make something. Anyway to skip that part is to buy vehicles or clothes that are on the market and have been customized. Lastly there is the way this game makes you rage, with the lag and the pay 2 win style, the most anoying part is when you die, you get played a taunt from the enemy that can be really â¥â¥â¥â¥ing anoying. This game has made me rage so much on my friends that we stopped playing it.  In the end, I wonder why I even played this game for so long.

10688	1	a	One of the most greedy companies out there, Kabam, has FINALLY sold this game to a new and much more promising one: DECA games. This is somewhat of a godsend if you ask me, as Kabam had given up on the game a while ago and weren't active at all.  In the short time that DECA has been at the steering wheel, they have already made miracles happen and shown that they aren't afraid to take the game down for a day while fixing a few things. This proves that they're capable of changing things Kabam didn't care about and that they are quick to act when crisis strikes. Due to Kabams inactivity, they game had slowly began to die out and lose most of its dedicated players. With DECA, the game has been revived, and A LOT of players have returned.   The future is bright for the Realm.
2819	1	a	Im as gay as this game!
1071	1	a	Lots of fun!!!
8729	0	a	I do not recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a game to play and have fun in it, I had to download the files, the install them on the launcher, and after that i had to fix corrupted files and then re install the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing â¥â¥â¥â¥, not only that but whenm i finally got into the game i had to make a seemingly useless account so i can play, and once i did everything, made my character, chose a name, and finally picked a server, I got in and had great gameplay, no lag everything loaded fine, i could see the other players and i could see they custom shirts and what not, but i kept on getting kicked from game because of aparent 'slow internet' so when i kept try to play i kept getting kicked, so i really dont think this game is worth it, it looks fun, but it doesnt let you play, good job developers.
9859	0	a	Post apocaliptic??? Survival game??? WTF, It feels like an mmo, not a survival game. 10/10 ign
7967	0	a	This game is very very P2W.  and If you don't believe me, go ahead, and you will find out that its very p2w during your first mission, you will have someone with a gun that takes you down with 2 shots, because he/she bought this gun on market place, but you start with probably one of the best free machine guns in game, and you have to put half of the magazine to kill someone, so stupid!
273	1	a	Spent a lot of money on it, then GTA V came out and this game died... It was fun while it lasted. Most customization ive ever seen in a game.
9651	1	a	i love this game 
8821	0	a	Guys, im sorry to give this a bad review. But there are alot of bugs and things that i just hate in this game.     Ok so first off, i have played this since i was 6 and i loved it. That was when i was 6. i got back into it at 11. (my age right now). Im going to list alot of topics in this.     Aiming  So i have alot to say about aiming. I think its unique but stupid too. When i am aiming at a person i have to press v to switch sides. and this is my personal recomendation but i prefer when its in the middle of the screen.I cant hit them with anything because of the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t aiming even at point blank because any mouse sensitivity doesnt work, even with a damn shotgun. Also i cant even see my shoes when looking at my character, except when im looking down. Next topic.      Radar  Ok this is not as important but you should still read it. When i am trying to kill someone, it doesnt show them on my radar, unless they are in plain sight, also it mostly all of the time, shows people below you. Which i think is â¥â¥â¥â¥in stupid. Also it doesnt show them when they are 'hiding'. i put that in quotes because that mechanic is â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t. Next topic.      Grenades and Splash Damage  Ok when a vehicle is near me and explodes it should kill me. Even with perks. Also grenades, without perks.      Loading  Ok the loading is way to long, if they could fix that it would be nice.      G1C  You get a ripoff of G1C when you pay. if they could increase the amount of G1C that you get it would also be nice.
5652	0	a	I cant launch it closes the launcher i hope the dev gets ran over ohhhh and watch 10000000 fanboys are going to spam me with tiyney wittle wage commwents oooh im willy swarwd &gt;:( i hate this stupid idiotic developers!
1271	1	a	The lag on this game is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing joke, it actually just makes you angry when you play because the server is so crap it can't handle the game itself. you get good days and bad but really, Don't drop a single cent into this game as I made the mistake of doing, you'll get owned by aimbotters who don't care if they get banned because they just create new free accounts and start all over again. I just played a game now after some time and wow, the lag made me want to throw my laptop into a wall.
8733	0	a	Doesnt even launch.Best piece of â¥â¥â¥â¥ on steam.
1450	1	a	APB Is a game with endless thought of makeing cars, people ect. The only thing crappy about the game is the lag i cant stand lag but i get used to it everthing else is perfect! 11/10
156	1	a	Do you like pay 2 win games? Do you love gambling your real money for op weapons? Do you LOVE companies that make the game worse every patch? Well If you do. You came to the right place.
2220	1	a	The bad:  -â¥â¥â¥â¥ Community {10% of the community is Fine {90% of hackers, kids, f*ckers (griefers, insulting you,tryhards etc..) It's at a point to prefer League of legends community than this ... mh ... nothing, just kill it.  -Bad matchmaking -Lag usually (servers are toasters, getting DDoS-ed sometimes and take years to be back) -Need Supercomp to run fine, and supercomp or not: Fps drops like dubstep : stand in front of a burning car = -30fps ~ -Anticheat is crappy, ban randomly: Freeban for everyone, legit or hackers, you spend 400$ in this game? Log in and see error 10008: Permabanned! -Armas marketplace (shop) is very expensive  The good:  -Awesome concept, sadly it's failing. -Freedom of custom (need premium in big part, so you must pay) -Events (50% are events to make you buy something) -Lol  [WARNING]  -Play this game kill your mood -You become aggressive -Be rich if you want something -People prefer pay a hack than buy something on it, or both. -Don't break your keyboard on it, it's useless

10344	1	a	This is one of the best mixes of a Wasteland MMORPG if you want a game to hang out with or complete quests with friends you should really try this game.
1723	1	a	It's a very amazing game, encourages you to try harder each time you finish a mission, but it's pretty annoying with the lag, the rendering issues, and the unbalanced weapons.
2880	1	a	It never seemed to run on my computer but I have always wanted to play it. I am undecided but it would mosst likely be a positive.
7764	0	a	Worst â¥â¥â¥â¥ing thing ever. i â¥â¥â¥â¥ing remmeber it being really good and non laggy at all but now it takes out all your â¥â¥â¥â¥ing memory in your computer and makes it unplayeable. even â¥â¥â¥â¥ing gw2 runs smoothly then this garbage

535	1	a	Basically what is GTA V for free but backwards in the fact that it's a MMO so there really isn't much of a story. Gameplay is fun and I had a fun time even thought these types of games aren't really my thing. Although I enjoyed customizing my character, and just roaming around the streets in my car listening to music.   I may just play for a while longer and it will keep me busy for awhile. As someone whod doesn't really like guns it's not really my thing. But if you like GTA type games then you will like this one.    This review is rather short and lacking compared to my typical review but it's just more of a short my thoughts.
4	1	a	APB Reloaded is a game with a storied past of a launch that ultimately failed and a company that resurrected a product that many probably believe should've been left to die. Where Realtime Worlds failed to deliver a perfect product, however, GamersFirst has slapped on a number of band-aids and made the best of a bad situation. And we thank them for it.  The main issues of APB Reloaded are in its very particular hardware requirements that will cause the game to hang and crash unless you can work around them - and the deplorable and oft-buggy implementation of the mostly useless PunkBuster service, which has a bad habit of kicking players for its inability to function without initializing services on your PC that often won't load, or can't be found. However, if you can power thorugh, find fixes for and look past the game's shortcomings, the game itself is a blast to play.  The game offers a small but well-designed pair of open-world combat maps wherein you are randomly assigned missions through their well-implemented matchmaking system and battle it out on the streets with handguns, shotguns, fully automatic weapons and much more in what is essentially games of 'Capture the Flag,' 'King of the Hill,' 'Deathmatch' and many more orthodox PvP mainstays. You won't find a lot of new innovations in gameplay, but what the game does, it does well. Game balance is fine-tuned over many years of service, and more recently, it's far less common to see people using aimbots or hacking than it was even a year ago.  The game is at its most frustrating when you find yourself up against players who have, through microtransactions, secured weaponry or vehicles that are very difficult to acquire as a free player. At times, the game feels like a 'Pay to Win' Freemium nightmare, but it still remains skill-based, and though the rich among us have an edge, a veteran TPS player will still find themselves winning as often as they lose. This said, those afraid of the Free-to-Play model, steer clear! This is not the game for you.  The shining point of APB is in its character customization. Peerless in multiplayer games, it allows astounding volume in character creation options, going beyond even facial generation and into custom-made personal decals on the abundant clothing options and tattoos, which you are able to project and position freely on your avatar. No two players look exactly alike, though there are a lot of less imaginitive people who prefer to make Marvel Superheroes or TV characters. And surprisingly, the game holds up graphically even today.  It is a flawed, but ultimately very fun game that you can easily spend hours on.
10501	0	a	Before you say I have no experience with this game, I have played for a good few hundred hours on the browser version.  This game USED to be good. It really was. Back then, a company called Wildshadow owned the game. It was truly f2p, with skill and no money required.  Then, a company called Kabam took over. They changed the game into a cashgrab. Skins? Buy gold. Vaults and characters? Buy gold. 1-life weapons or keys? Buy gold. Everything is gold gold gold. Updates are rare, and even when they come they just add more items to be purchased with gold. In fact, the way they 'celebrate' holidays is by creating cheap weapon reskins for more people to buy with.. you guessed it, gold!!  You might be thinking, at least there's player interaction! No, there isn't. The game is infested with hackers, scammers, enemy draggers, spambots, etc. Kabam doesn't care at all. After all, you don't make any money from clearing away hackers, so why bother?  TL;DR: Stay away.
7596	0	a	Do not play. christ its a buggy game with no hitboxes, terrible gunplay, and its pay 2 win.

3795	0	a	My old review got taken down by the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ devs, so here it is. Got a new PC a few months ago, wanted to try out the game that I once adored with my good friend Bassdrop. I can't say that I am surprised, but once again the game is a dissapointment. If theres anything interesting, it's how much real money you can spend at the armas marketplace before going homeless. This game is a cash grab, plain and simple. You will not enjoy this game without spending atleast $100 and a $800+ PC because this game runs on an old â¥â¥â¥ Unreal engine that is outdated to â¥â¥â¥â¥ and you will never get above 40fps constant. In addition to that, you get amazing stuttering which is always fun especially when P2W users can buy the tommy gun(high rate of fire, big mag) and you get sprayed down and you can't do anything about it because it rapes your cpu. Engine upgrade should be something to get excited about, as the developpers have been promising for the last 2-3 years. No. Don't get your hopes up. This game is trash, the developpers are trash and the game is simply a cash grab. So far, it is working well for the developpers, everyone is buying their pay to win weapons â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t and there hasn't been a single proper content update since 1 year. I wasted so much time on this game, I regret it. Don't make the same mistake I did, don't get into this game it will not turn out well for you.  Gamersfirst, Reloaded Productions, suck big fat â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ and get the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of here.
6782	0	a	omg i loved this game but dosent work for me on windows 10 so sad CRYING D: D: D:
1951	1	a	First of all, for those who decide to play without a Premium subscription, the game is unforgiving and quite frankly, very frustrating. Every part of the game screams Pay-To-Win with unfair matchups, overpowered weapons, overpowered abilities, overpowered verhicles, high prices for items and so on. Many fights often end up being a question of 'who payed for what' and not 'who has the better skill', which is a real shame, because the the game itself is actually really fun. Everything is extremely customizable. From characters to cars to clothing. You'll never see the same character design twice. Also with activities such as robbing stores, jacking cars, muggin people etc., you can experience the life of the little Gangster you always wanted to be.  In short, for people who like GTA San Andreas-type of games, APB is a blast. Best played with friends and with a Premium subscription. If you don't want to pay or don't have the patience, quickly forget about this game, because it will make you go mad. Trust me.
2020	1	a	awsome 
6221	0	a	It has great character customization and some great features but the gameplay itself is extremely repetitive and overun by hackers and P2W Players. This game is the definition of Pay to Win. It sickens me.
6332	0	a	1 word. HACKS! id rather stab myself in the stomach then ever place the â¥â¥â¥â¥ign peice of â¥â¥â¥â¥ game again. â¥â¥â¥â¥ this game. â¥â¥â¥â¥ the community, â¥â¥â¥â¥ the devs, and â¥â¥â¥â¥ the fans
8811	0	a	to many micro transations 
10386	1	a	the one good thing about it not being high quality is that its not very laggy
8743	0	a	Such a horrible game, Match making is terrible. People with with speed buffs, Regen buffs, Health buffs, get put against new players and people without said buffs and totally wreck them. Gameplay as a whole is unbalanced, seems like almost all FtP games are Pay to win, and that the Devs don't give 2 â¥â¥â¥â¥s about hackers and security even though they say they do, they actually do not.  You might get lucky and win a game or two, then not win one for like 20 in a row. Or just get players who do nothing, or get put agianst players who purposely go down in rank so they can wreck noobs and lower ranks and get wins easily.  On another note, seems this game has a file integrity problem, and if your unlucky after a while you will never be able to load into the game again. No matter how many times you uninstall and reinstall the game, or repair the game as I've done. I am not even going to bother sending a letter to the Devs as I am sure they will not give a flying â¥â¥â¥â¥.
9544	1	a	metacritic gave it above 5/100!?!?!?! i thought they only gave high scores to call of duty    :/
2218	1	a	Best free game you can get on steam. Its extra fun if you have some friends added into the mix.
5738	0	a	I remember when this game was just APB: All Points Buletin and man does it still suck as much. I really want to enjoy this game because there are very few if almost no open world cops and robbers games. In short don't let the screenshots and videos fool you, yes the customization is deep and the emblem system puts games like COD Black ops to shame. Yet everything else about this game is subpar and broken. 6 years and there is still a massive pay to win system and it feels as if there is one giant hitbox and that is it. There is no visible difference to damage when you shoot someone in the head or in the bloody pinkie toe. As good as I want it to be and as much as I can forgive and forget to enjoy myself this is not one of those games. Save your time and your cash in p2w bundles and go play GTA Online instead.
4827	0	a	I played this game for a little bit and was having a blast at first, but i found a lot more things that were very frustrating!!! We will start with the cons because there is alot of them!  Cons-  1. The game has a steep learning curb for new players. That's all I have to say about this because it speaks for itself.  2. The match making system is terrible!!! I went into my first match expecting a fun game but was destroyed by higher ranked players!!  3. Money- MONEY IS HARD TO GET!!!! as an enforcer you are at disadvantage when you try to make money because missions are your primary source of money the only good money you get is if you win a match. Criminals have it easier when trying to make money because they can raid stores, take stuff and sell it for small amounts of cash but its not much and if you want to buy good stuff you have to do this for hours which can be boring after a while. Money is essential in this game to get new stuff as it is in every game, but this game requires you to have a lot of money to buy stuff and you get money at a really slow rate.  4. Pay to win!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is my least favorite thing in any game because it causes balancing issues and deter's new players from wanting to play. I got so frustrated when I would put a full mag into a enemy player and he doesn't die then he turns around and fire 2 shots and I am dead!! This would be the thing the got to me the most and is what made me quit playing.  5. The community- Not all the players on this game are bad some were very helpful in situations when I didn't know what to do. A lot of people were very negative and said racist thing they would also threaten each other in the district chat. My team would get mad and start to cuss each other out alot which distracted me from the game and lowered my i.q.   Pros-  1. The clothing market! I was always excited to go to the social district and see how everybody designed their clothes because no one looked the same and the thing people could do with their designs baffled me! I was able to buy a few clothes and look completely different than anyone else and that made my character feel unique.  2. And finally the character creation- I loved this feature becuase they put alot of time to making sure that you look different than any other player in the game. There were tons of small features to choose from the nose bridge and the eye brow width just to name a few examples. Though there could have been more hair styles to choose from I was fine with the few I had available.  I would not recommend this game becuase there are a lot of issues with the game and it doesn't feel like they finnished the game. If i had to score the game i would give it a 3.5/10.  Thanks for reading my review! :)
8304	0	a	Bad game is BAD!!!! 0/100
1389	1	a	Lots of fun, if you don't mind a cops &amp; robbers style FPS that is somewhat 3rd person. Along with the fact that its VERY pay to win based. Playing it F2P is still tons better than almost every other F2P game that has P2P options.
1612	1	a	I'm confused, I can't get think is this a game, I thought more as a joke, even the years past playing it, i lost a lot of time, but really i did? But hey, this is really cute. I think it approaches as an astral mystical experience, and i don't think it's only me.  PS: This game will have a higher chance of get your brain f***ed hard, so, be aware.
619	1	a	Game is absolutely amazing. Love it in every way I can. Alot of actions to perform and challenging games against other players.
1244	1	a	Okey heres the deal, this game is a hackers sandbox....with potential. All the old players understand that this game is good, it can be played for free even if its not ideal, and the customisation is what realy sets this game apart, but them hackers tho  Honestly when this game has cleared that problem up then this game will be great again, for any old player has played those matches without hacks were genuine skill were what counted and enjoyed them
3179	1	a	This is the best game ever in my opinion any way I recommend this at a 5 Star rate
6890	0	a	I played the game before it was reloaded. Lets just say that while not playing the game I enjoyed much better games made by a developer that don't ban you because you asked them why you got an email from them.  Lets say this from when I did play. The controls suck it has no controller support to make driving better.  The graphics are not terrible but they could be better.  The physics engine used is a joke.   The amount of hackers is insane.   -This is what you get for asking why you got a email notice-  Dear Player,  Your GamersFirst account has been suspended in the past 24 hours.

Guess I can't now oh well.
4090	0	a	Worst game ever! Do not play this S%#T.
4850	0	a	Honestly it's the best bad game I ever played. But in the end I'm sad I spent nearly 4 years playing it and almost 6 months of actual play time invested (that's 4k and a few hours) ( and no I don't login with steam often so it's less here.) that I will never get back, don't be fooled by the new paintjob it got with FF, FF is a s-hit anticheat and does nothing to save this game just move right along and play another game. Trust me it's not worth the time get good at a better or more important game.
9668	0	a	its dump, cofusing, and it has the worst grapics and it takes for ever to load. 
1724	1	a	An excellent third person shooter with tons of ability to customize your look and your vehicle. The game consists of two very large (1000+ meters) city maps where many teams of either faction are engaged in missions simultaneously. All in all a fantastic third person shooter that I spent hundreds of hours playing!  Pros - Full customization of vehicle and character with large multitudes of clothing and the ability to make completely custom designs. Every character and vehicle looks completely unique. - Large array of guns with custom skins, though most of the skins have to be bought through the in game store. - Progression system. If you like these, it's there. You get quick access to the base versions of guns, so it's not too bad. Though, things such as the OPGL and OSMAW come much later, as well as a couple of the cars. - Frequently matched against new people, so you're not playing against the same team over and over again like in other multiplayer shooters.  Cons - The open world can lead to griefing and 'ghosting' on occasion, or just some frustration as you're trying to drive to the next objective as quickly as you can while getting rammed by cars driven by other players. - Some of the guns in the in game store which cost real money to buy can be considered across the board better than some of the guns available as free to play.
6486	0	a	no start why??
75	1	a	i hate this game so much but holy â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ me if i don't love it 10/10
1207	1	a	It is so so.
3038	1	a	Been playing this game on and off for years, and finally something somewhere was fixed and I can FINALLY play the game without server lag like I had all the time before. Now to get right into what I think and what you should/shouldn't expect.    If you're into a great balanced, and fair battle system, please stray as far away as possible from this game. APB has arguably the most back@ssed, unfair and poorly balanced gun mechanics I've ever seen in a game. I mean you could shoot the enemy in the face 10 times with a pistol and they won't die, I have literally hit people point black 100% accuracy with grenades and they took no damage and when they throw one in my general direction I went flying. The driving mechanics are also all miss, not even close to hitting but it gets the job done. Physics in this game do NOT EXIST. The missions get repetitive after a while, but you realize how much you need to do them to unlock everything so you'll have to bare with it. The matchmaking is also pretty terrible since there is no skill matching (at least that does its job) or level/rank system, so if you're starting out, have fun dying A LOT from people who have either been playing for a while and have better stuff than you or are hackers. That's another thing, this game is kinda old, and I feel like the developer just doesn't care much more about security so there are plenty of hackers.   Really, I'm sure by now you're probably going 'wow this game sounds like it sucks bad' but let me give you my reasoning as to why this is still one of the most interesting and worthwhile (for a little while at least) MMO's around.    Customization. This game does it better than any game around, unless maybe you're playing Black Desert or Sims 4. Absolutely amazing customization options for detailed character creation, tattoos, cars, custom music, all kinds of armor options, and more. Honestly I would consider this more of a social simulator with guns and cars than an actual third-person shooter MMO, since the focus on the personal and social aspects seem to carry a bit more weight. Graphically the game has held up surprisingly really well. One of the more pretty games you'll see from the last generation of MMO's (obviously no match for something like ArcheAge, Black Desert or Dirty Bomb though (but who really cares)) Another maybe little but big to me thing that I love is that you can import your own music from your computer into your in-game radio to listen to in the car which adds a nice bit of immersion, and yes I know I could just open up Spotify, but I just like having it this way.   If you go into this game expecting GTA or Saints Row quality gameplay, you'll be surely disappointed. This isn't bad though. This game doesn't really try to BE either of the two. If you love having vast and unique customization tools and just trying something other than the typical cookie-cutter MMORPG/FPS give it a try. Don't just go in for 30 minutes, really give it a good few hours, learn the game, unlock some stuff and feel it out. It may or may not be for you.
9887	1	a	really good
9328	0	a	The uninstall button works pretty well 10/10
9198	0	a	Don't download unless you are willing to wait hours upon hours dowloaing it. Then waiting more hours downloading an update when you want to play.
8657	0	a	Literally 10 minutes into the game, and I gave up. Now that says something.
4864	0	a	Don't give them your money! Just buy GTA5 and play online. It's the same thing but better!
5779	0	a	ughhh 
9034	1	a	This game takes time and lots of grinding to higher levels, and it is difficult as if you where actually in an apocolypse. This game is very fun if you are able to get past the fact that the story is everywhere and the constant need for better equipment and materials. Though personally if you get a few friends and play through the game it makes things alot more fun for all involved.
3688	1	a	
6192	0	a	it is ablsolt crap i got done for nothing it is serisoly anoying pepole spawn kill so its a WASTE OF TIME TO PLAY so i dont recomend this 0/10
6687	0	a	This game is all good except for the fact that I got a bug from it where it tells my friends that I am playing APB all the time, regardless of what I'm playing now. It also wont let me delete it because of the fact that it still thinks that I am in-game.
7841	0	a	I had heard nothing but good things about this game, decided to try it... couldn't delete it fast enough.  â¢ Character Custimization: Beyond slow. Unless I randomized it, I wasn't able to create jack s**t for my character. â¢ In Game: I watched as my boyfriend got in game (finally), only to struggle to find where a 'locker' was located with his clothes he had just bought....ONLY to discover that everything he had just spent money on wasn't even there.   IMO this could have been something great, it just seems little effort was put in to it.
2547	1	a	Saints row MMO. 
5358	0	a	Dosent download properly
6378	0	a	IN my opinion this is just another one of those games that look like gta V's ugly cousin :v
3288	1	a	I greatly engoy this game. heck, its my favorite game. the animations are a bit rough but if i had to choose i would pick apb reloaded. good job creators.
9958	1	a	I'd recommend this game to anyone its got a great concept for a mmo that you just don't see in most post-apocalyptic survival games.
2065	1	a	after playing it for a little bit i have this to say its K but not to K
9847	1	a	To put this game simple here are the pros and cons  Pros -The crafting systm is unique and refreshes your gameplay experince giving you better gameplay  -The game is open world giving you many places to travel -The looting system is common and easy to understand -The enemys in the game are unique from other characters you will see in games -The game is free to play -The game is not pay to win  Cons -The graphics are not the best -The game makes alot of people lag even with a good running system -The game has alot of bugs and when the server has to do maintenence it will take it awhile -The NPC seem dead they dont talk much -The Combat in the game is not the funniest thing you will do -The hud is all over the screen  Overall Graphics-5/10 Gameplay-7/10   So out of 20 i gave it a 12 but if you like free then this is your game    
2301	1	a	Something about this game makes me feel like I am worse at it now than I was when I first started playing APB. But all in all it's good fun and just roaming around in cool rides( or crashing into every single obstalce) and getting dragged into missions makes it a 8/10 game.
6485	0	a	buggy as hell and doesnt want to load the game and if you do get in the game you might get about two min with the game before it crashes. i dont recommend this game to anybody.
7777	0	a	this game does not work dont waist ur time on this â¥â¥â¥â¥, after 4 hours of waiting then this game doesint work!!
6101	0	a	HORRIBLE game, sorry. microtransactions, grinding, the works
8477	0	a	if you play have fun going to lag hell , dont recommend
10565	1	a	Can't spell 'Realm of the Mad God' without 'mad'. This game will make you want to tear your hairs out of your head at times.  Good â¥â¥â¥â¥.
5951	0	a	you will be constantly fixing it while the reward isnt to great (gta clone) as it disintagrates the entire computer
601	1	a	One of the best games ever.
9352	0	a	I was dropped into the game with no understanding of it, i was given no useful inforation from the game, i wondered around clicking everything i could and nothing happened. The most fun i had was uninstalling
5615	0	a	wasted a minute and a half of my life downloading this game, to waste another 20 minutes getting the game to even start, to waste another 30 minutes trying to figure out why i had a blank black screen but could still hear the game sound, to finally waste another minute in a half figuring out that this game is not windows 10 compatible.....
4281	0	a	apb reloaded is a game for people who like 3rd person shooters, if i were you i would get membership becuase you make money faster and also unlocks more. You can play without membership but takes alot longer to make money and get things. The maps are fun to explore but the mishions are for the most part the same:( if you have GTA 5 and you think its the same you are wrong its alot different, if you wanna be a cop it takes longer to make money i learned that the hard way... be a robber/enemy what ever you like to call it lol just my opion. BUT the game is mostly PAY TO WIN if you have no money RIP if you do spend it.    10/10
1394	1	a	selling rare pepes please hit up my profile
5900	0	a	I remember playing this game when it first came out. Didn't like it then because the controls were a pain in the â¥â¥â¥, couldn't summon my vehicle, couldn't remove items from my locker and place them in my inventory. EVEN IN AN AMMO ZONE!  Thought hey I'll quit playing this pos and take my clan with me and MAYBE, just MAYBE when when we come back, the developers will have fixed the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t controls. Nope.  Developers still haven't developed a temporary spawn for players spawning in on either team. Still have â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ campers they immediatly put you in a crossfire or run your over almost immediatly as you spawn back in.  All in all. This game is still extremely poorly balanced apparently will never be fixed, even with the Pay-2-Win gamers it attracts. I miss the this game, but it isn't worth the time or effort.
4885	0	a	it lags way too much and i have a good computer
10596	1	a	This has got to be one of my favorite free to play MMOs of all time. It has great coop gameplay which relies on skill to stay alive, and staying alive is very important because it is a PERMADEATH game. It runs in Flash, so its compatible with almost all systems. The graphics are a retro pixelated masterpiece and will definitely bring on the nostalgia. The game has no ending, making it very addictive. This game is still being updated regularly and new content is being added all the time. There are 14 classes to unlock, loads of items to be found, dungeons for all skill levels, and a guild system to help encourage cooperation.  This game is also full of bugs that are difficult to fix, given the nature of the coding. The bugs aren't game-breaking but can get annoying at times. There is an unsolvable issue with memory leaks that will force you to restart the game every hour or so. Spambots advertise for websites that sell items illegally. Do not buy anything from them. The items they sell can be farmed in the game without spending any money. There is a trading system which you can use to buy, sell, trade, or gift items with other players. Do not spend money on items, it is a waste!  Some people, including myself, experience a bit of lag when playing the Steam version of this game. If you have issues such as input delay, I encourage you to give it another shot by playing it at its home,  www.realmofthemadgod.com .  With all that in mind, I still thoroughly enjoy this game and support its development by buying extra vault space and character slots. I would recommend it to anyone who likes skill based shooters and MMORPGs. Did I mention its FREE?!  Update: Since I quit playing RotMG regularly, a lot has changed. The old management is out and new people have taken their place and seem to be doing much better. They seem to make much better use of their resources and have their priorities in a much better order. The game and owners/developers are making much needed progress and deserve a little recognition.

7000	0	a	this game does not run its a ripoff
3693	1	a	It's a very nice game :P The Graphics aren't the best but alot of fun :D
2799	1	a	APB is a very nice game but too bad I mean get stuck in the game I play 2-3 minutes and locks. Pretty please help me. Thanks
8789	0	a	I like this game quite a lot, which is why I have 258.4 hours in it, but I can't recommend it becuase it uses the worst anti cheat known to man. We mortals merely call it 'punkbuster' this god awful invention is believed to date back to Soviet times where Soviet scientists were thinking what the best way to ruin the western games market was. They decided that the absolutely best way was to make a anti-cheat so horrible that it kicks random people off server, aswell as scan your files when you are not even on the game. So in summary great game but uses anti-cheat developed by the soviets to troll gamers.
5712	0	a	It would probably be a bit better if this game wasn't a game where (paying) is not included casually
7968	0	a	Game given to us from the heavens includes: The game not working correctly Bugs Runs in background AND MANY MORE Game Of The Year 2015 11/10 Would Uninstall Again!
5828	0	a	The game was extremely fun but it ruined my computer and caused it to freeze a lot. im pretty sure it gave it a bug but if you dont have this problem then yeah get it but i had to delete it and it took several weeks for it to get back to normal
9229	0	a	this game is â¥â¥â¥â¥.  iv only payed like 0,5 hours but it sucks more than â¥â¥â¥â¥ing blockade. i do not know how you can play this game, i saw a guy in the reviews that had played for 3900 hours... WHAT THE â¥â¥â¥â¥ it must be the creator of the game.
1321	1	a	One time I played this game and got an errection that lasted more than 4 hours.
9803	0	a	I played it. Got renamed to a ridiculous name because my name offended the you know who. Then the same mod who had renamed me popped up in main chat to ask people to keep the discussion to game related Q&amp;A. I wasnt even chatting at the time, and the people who were were simply chit chatting. Apparently this is too much for this concentration camp of a game. No fun allowed. Only talk about the game.  I â¥â¥â¥â¥ing hate this â¥â¥â¥â¥. Burn down every game company that manages its users like stupid cattle. God forbid giving personal details or talking about fun stuff. It might create you know, DISCUSSION. We dont want that. We want stupid morons who only talk about the game and pay their dues. Die. Eat it and die.
8429	0	a	This was a fun game, but the devs don't really care about the players. If you play legitly and get banned, oh well. They won't help you. This game had a lot going for it, but due to the devs and the community, this game is not worth getting, even though it is free to play, which really means free to grind for hours on end for something you can just buy for a few dollars. The trailers also falsely lead you to believe that you can shoot anyone and take on any player at any given moment, which is not true. You have to be in a mission of some sort to have any pvp of any sort, and there is no pve at all.  Verdict: Not worth your time. If you want to play a game like this, Grand Theft Auto V has a better community, a better development team, and overall is just more fun thatn this.
4168	0	a	The only redeeming quality of this game is its customization.  Everything else is rubbish.  2 / 10000 aim-botting, wall-hacking, wallet-warriors
7531	0	a	high population servers lag.the slowest loading game ever hit detection needs work.pay to win.....
7044	0	a	While the game has a great idea behind it, still one of the best around when it comes to character customization possibilities and has nicely flowing combat (if your pc can handle it), sadly the game is riddled with faults. Declining population, constantly rerolling cheaters who just can create new account as soon as previois one gets banned (which takes ungodly amount of time for them to do despite having 2 anti-cheat systems running), bad netcode causing loads of desync issues, servers failing to run at intended tickrate, etc...  That being said, if you're still interested to see it yourself after these warnings, why not give it a go? Just expect total misery and the game may happily suprise you (bet it won't in most cases though).
10725	1	a	I can't even describe how annoying this game is. You spend 20 minutes grinding to the point where it's actually kind of fun and challenging, and then sometimes within 5 minutes of that, you die, lose everything, completely reset, and you're back to having to grind with a new character. What's worse is the death is almost always do to a massive lag spike caused by the server dumping everyone into a final boss battle before resetting the map. This game takes almost zero skill, just luck and endless patience.
3580	1	a	Cops and Robbers with cars you can paint, clothes you can buy, and very nice guns you can shoot. At F2P, give it a shot, and let me know when you're on.
3242	1	a	Has lots of problems, mostly created by G1. Fun though. Lots of potential.
1718	1	a	If you have money to spend great game. If you want a real free to play game then no.
3279	1	a	This game is pure and insane fun. Imagine GTA. Multiply it several times. Total Chaos and Havoc everywhere. Two factions with clear focus on PvP action. Matchmaking is fluid and intuitive. Give it a shot, it's free.
9812	0	a	Crash Simulator 2011
10783	1	a	Used to play this game all the time- then Kabam came in. Rarely touched the game at all after that. DECA games has now stepped in and great improvements have been made. The game seems to be going in a great direction, and I can't wait to see what new content DECA will be adding.   The game is a bullet-hell MMO, with perma death. This makes the game very intense (if you are a new player, that is. Kabam added in pets and once you have played for a year or 2, just by simply having a good pet nearly everything in the game is no longer a challenge) and fun to play with friends.
9420	0	a	i could never figure out how to log in or even make an account. i never got past the damn login screen.
7858	0	a	APB Reloaded is a game where I can assume the dominant role in a 'Cops vs. Crooks' s&amp;m environment.
